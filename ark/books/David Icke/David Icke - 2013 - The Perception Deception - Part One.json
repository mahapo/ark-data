He whose gazeis fixed on a distant star, will not falter.Leonardo da VinciIt is important to give some background for anyone reading my work for the firsttime so they can see how the information has been dropping into my lap all theseyears. Readers of previous books will know the story and can move on, except fora little addition at the end.I was born in Leicester, England, on April 29th 1952. I daydreamed my waythrough school, never took a major exam and left to be a professional soccerplayer at the age of 15. I played most of my career with what was laterdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis and my final season was a daily agony beforemy career ended literally overnight when I had just turned 21. I was waking upone morning and in my half-sleep I realised that I couldn’t breathe. I tried towake my wife, Linda, but my body wouldn’t move. It was like it was frozen and Iwas pretty sure that I was about to die. But suddenly I gasped a breath and, asI did so, I felt excruciating pain in what seemed like every joint in my body. Ihad gone to bed a professional footballer and woke up never to play again. I wastold that I would probably end up in a wheelchair given how early the arthritishad started, but I was having none of that, thank-you. A series of amazingsynchronicities or ‘coincidences’, which I describe in other books, led to mebecoming a newspaper, radio and television journalist, a sports presenter withthe BBC and a national spokesman for the British Green Party (Fig 1). I had leda very eventful life by the age of 38, but nothing compared with what was tocome. I began to notice what you might call a ‘presence’ around me in early1989. Whenever I was in a room alone it was like I wasn’t alone. This becamemore powerful over many months and one night in 1990 the presence was sotangible in a London hotel room that I said out loud: ‘If there is anybody here,will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!’ A matter ofdays later I was with my son, Gareth, at a newspaper and book shop near ourhome. Gaz is a brilliant singer-songwriter now, but he was only a little boythen. I was talking to someone outside the shop while Gaz was inside looking atrailway books and I eventually went in to say that it was time to go. But as Istood in the doorway, my feet became stuck to the ground as if magnets werepulling them to the floor. I was standing there bewildered when I heard a‘voice’, or very strong thought, pass through my mind. It said: ‘Go and look atthe books on the far side.’ The pressure I felt on the soles of my feet subsidedand I walked in a daze towards the book section. I immediately spotted a book inamong the romantic novels, because it looked so different to all the rest. Thebook was called Mind to Mind written by a lady called Betty Shine (Fig 2). Iscanned the blurb on the back and I saw that Betty was a professional psychicand ‘hands-on’ healer. I read the book in 24 hours and I wondered if she mightpick up what was happening to me with regard to the ‘presence’. I arranged tomeet her and told her nothing about what I was experiencing. I said that Iwanted to see if her hands-on healing (an exchange of energy) would help myarthritis. I saw her four times. The first two visits were uneventful, but onthe third and fourth my life changed forever and an incredible journey began. Iwas sitting up on a medical-type bench when I suddenly felt like a spider’s webon my face. I remembered that Betty had said in her book that this can happenwhen other dimensions of reality are trying to lock into you. People think thatthey are seeing all there is to see when they observe the ‘world’, but it isonly a narrow band of frequency known as visible light. Infinity lies beyondhuman vision and it is possible to communicate with these other realities whichhave a far more advanced awareness than humans are allowed to have – for reasonsI will be explaining. It is like being trapped in one radio station ortelevision channel, but some can open their psyche to other ‘stations’ and‘channels’. I realised later that the ‘spider’s web’ that I was feeling waselectromagnetic energy ‘caressing’ my skin because an energetic communicationconnection was being projected into the room. I said nothing to Betty about whatI was feeling, but 10 to 15 seconds later she threw her head back and said:‘Wow! This is powerful. I’ll have to close my eyes for this one.’ She said thatshe was seeing a figure in her mind which was asking her to communicateinformation to me. The first thing she said was that ‘They’ knew that I wantedthem to contact me but the time wasn’t right until now. I had mentioned nothingto her about the experience in the hotel room when I said: ‘If there is anybodyhere, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!’ Aseries of other messages followed and these are some of them:> [../Images/00120.jpg]> Figure 1: Many ‘lives’ in one.[../Images/00562.jpg]Figure 2: Betty Shine.> • He is a healer who is here to heal the Earth and he will be world famous.> • He is still a child, spiritually, but he will be given the spiritual> riches.> • Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will be> our words.> • Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led to> knowledge.> • He was chosen as a youngster for his courage. He has been tested and has> passed all the tests.> • He was led into football to learn discipline, but when that was learned it> was time to move on. He also had to learn how to cope with disappointment,> experience all the emotions, and how to get up and get on with it. The> spiritual way is tough and no one makes it easy.> • He will always have what he needs [this could have been ‘wants’], but no> more.I saw Betty Shine a week later and the same thing happened. These messagesincluded:> • One man cannot change the world, but one man can communicate the message> that will change the world.> • Don’t try to do it all alone. Go hand in hand with others, so you can pick> each other up as you fall.> • He will write five books in three years.> • Politics is not for him. He is too spiritual. Politics is anti-spiritual> and will make him very unhappy.> • He will leave politics. He doesn’t have to do anything. It will happen> gradually over a year.> • There will be a different kind of flying machine, very different from the> aircraft of today.> • Time will have no meaning. Where you want to be, you will be.Things began to move quickly after those messages. The BBC said they were notgoing to renew my contract and I reduced my work with the Green Party over thenext twelve months or so until I left altogether. I was out of work and had noincome, but I felt like a prison door had opened so unhappy had I been for yearsworking for the BBC. My life became an extraordinary series of ‘coincidences’and happenings after Betty Shine. I was led to knowledge through people that Imet and through books, documents, a few more psychics in those early days, andpersonal experiences at home and abroad. This is still going on nearly a quarterof a century later. These two communications through Betty Shine and anotherpsychic have certainly proved to be true:> Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will be our> words. Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led> to knowledge.> Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only> have to follow the clues ... We are guiding you along a set path. It was all> arranged before you incarnated.This is precisely what I have experienced in the last nearly 25 years. I wrotemy first book on these subjects in 1990 with the title Truth Vibrations becausesome of the messages had said that a reality-changing transformation washappening in the Earth’s energy field which would awaken humanity from itsslumber and amnesia. This energetic change would reveal all that had been hiddenfrom us and trigger an awakening in which enormous numbers of people wouldreassess their perception of self and the world. There was no sign of this atthe time but it is clearly happening today as people who would have once laughedat the information in this book are now seeing its validity.‘When you feel the rain ...’I began to feel the urge to go to Peru in South America in early 1991. I didn’tknow why, I just knew I needed to go there and I went purely through intuition.My three weeks in Peru turned out to be an incredible series of synchronicitiesand experiences that led me to a place called Sillustani, not far from the cityof Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca which, at some 13,000 feet above sealevel, is said to be the highest navigable lake in the world (Fig 3). Sillustaniis described as a burial site from the Inca period in the tourist blurbs but itgoes back much further as we perceive ‘time’. The Peruvian guide showing mearound the country booked us into a hotel in Puno called The Sillustani and as Ilooked at pictures of the place on the hotel wall I felt very strongly that Ihad to go there. So off I went the next day with the guide and a driver in amini-bus/taxi. I spent an hour walking around and it was beautiful, but I wentback to the bus quite disappointed because what I had felt did not match thepowerful urge I’d had to visit the place. A few minutes down the road on the wayback to Puno, as I was daydreaming looking out of the window, I saw a hill to myright. Words began repeating in my mind – ‘come to me, come to me, come to me’.What? I asked the driver to stop and I climbed the hill. As I did so, I cameacross a circle of stones. I walked to the centre and I experienced a repeat ofwhat happened in the newspaper shop. The soles of my feet began to burn andtingle with a sort of magnetism and I couldn’t move them. I then felt energyentering the top of my head and flowing down into the ground with another flowcoming the other way. My arms spontaneously stretched out to 45 degrees, as Ire-enacted on my return visit on my 60th birthday in 2012 (Fig 4). I made noconscious decision to do this – it just happened. I clearly heard a voice in mymind at this point saying: ‘It will be over when you feel the rain.’ This seemedcrazy because there was not a cloud in the sky in any direction. The energypassing through me became ever more powerful until my whole body was shaking.Time meant nothing anymore. It didn’t exist (which it doesn’t in truth, as Ishall explain). I returned to my conscious mind every now and again, but mostlyI was ‘out there’ while all this was going on. I saw a light grey mist over thedistant mountains during one of these conscious mind moments. The mist becameprogressively darker very quickly and I could see that it was now rainingheavily. I watched the storm come towards me in a straight-line ‘front’ untilthe clouds covered the Sun and a wall of stair-rod rain came across the hill andstruck me with such power that I was instantly drenched. As the rain hit me, theenergy that had been passing through me for maybe an hour immediately stopped.My arms had been in the air all this time and I felt nothing, but now myshoulders were very painful and my legs so weak that for few minutes I struggledto stand. Energy was still pouring from my hands and feet. My feet were likethat for the next 24 hours. I had no idea what had just happened and it was onlyyears later that I understood the process. The energy passing through me wasestablishing an electromagnetic connection through which information could becommunicated. I was being ‘locked-in’ to ‘Mission Control’ in some otherdimension or dimensions of reality, and something known as the ‘kundalini’ wasalso being activated. This is an energy located in the lower spinal area which,when activated, shoots up the central nervous system and out through the top ofthe head to connect you with other levels of reality. I don’t mean the‘physical’ head – a hole didn’t suddenly appear. This happens within energeticfields of the body beyond human sight. Itzhak Bentov described this process verywell in his book, Stalking the Wild Pendulum:[../Images/00164.jpg]Figure 3: The ruins at Sillustani.[../Images/00247.jpg]Figure 4: Return to Peru: Looking across to Sillustani in 2012 recreating whathappened.> The kundalini, as described in yoga literature, is said to be an energy,> coiled up like a serpent at the base of the spine. When this energy is> ‘awakened’, it enters the spine, rises up along it, and is seen or perceived> as a luminous serpent by the person having the experience. Once it has risen> into the head, the luminous rod hopefully pierces the top of the head; that> is, the rod-like energy beam is seen as projecting through the skull pointing> upward. When this happens, the person is said to be ‘illuminated’. Eventually,> such a person may become highly intuitive and develop some psychic powers,> such as clairvoyance, clairaudience or healing abilities.[../Images/00128.jpg]Figure 5: ‘Er, what’s my name, where am I?’When the kundalini suddenly unleashes its power as monumentally as it did withme after the Sillustani experience, it is like riding a bucking bronco after aheavy session down the bar. Information, concepts and insights began to pourinto my ‘human’ mind and I was like a computer that freezes when too muchinformation is communicated all at once. What followed were three crazy monthsduring which I was somewhere else and all bridges to my old life were set ablazeby the media coverage of what I was saying about my experiences at a time when Iwas in a complete daze (Fig 5). I was interviewed on a primetime BBC televisiontalk show in this state (you can see it on YouTube) and what followed wasridicule on a scale that few can ever have experienced. I see everything todaywith the benefit of hindsight very differently to when I was going through somevery dark and painful periods of my life. Hindsight is another way of saying‘perspective’ and that, in turn, means that you can see the dots and how theyconnect instead of being consumed by the single dot – the experience – which atthe time seems to have no rhyme or reason. Life doesn’t give you what you wantso much as what you need so you can have what you want. In my case if I was tohave what I wanted (to understand reality and the forces driving human society)then I had to go through heaps of ‘darkness’ to break the perception patternsthat were hiding the truth and to give me insight into the nature of the world Iam living in. The mass ridicule set me free of what other people said andthought about me. The fear of what other people think is one of the mostenslaving and suppressing of all emotional states. If we succumb to this then weare no longer expressing our truth and uniqueness but a version of ourselvesthat others have insisted that we must ‘be’ if we are not to face their ridiculeand condemnation. What happened to me, challenging as it was, freed me from thatprison cell. So in that case were those experiences really ‘darkness’ or werethey a gift? I say the latter from the perspective of today but I would not havesaid the same when they were happening. My life was a daily nightmare for yearswith a lead weight sitting in my belly that rarely gave me respite. I wasridiculed almost wherever I went and anything I said was dismissed as theravings of a lunatic. My children were being abused and ridiculed at school.What had I done? Where was this going? What was the point of it all? What washappening to me? I am aware of the process now and so I have a differentrelationship with experience, but not then. The verdict was that David Icke wasinsane. It seemed that my life was over, although, in reality, it was only justbeginning. Itzhak Bentov writes:> It is ironic that persons in whom the evolutionary processes of Nature have> begun to operate more rapidly, and who can be considered as advanced mutants> of the human race, are institutionalised as subnormal by their ‘normal’ peers.> I dare to guess, on the basis of discussions with my psychiatrist-friends,> that this process is not as exotic and rare as one would like us to believe,> and possibly 25 to 30 percent all institutionalised schizophrenics belong to> this category – a tremendous waste of human potential.> The reason for this is that they have been catapulted suddenly into a> situation in which they are functioning in more than one reality. They can see> and hear things occurring in our neighbouring realities, that is the astral or> other higher realities, because their ‘frequency responses’ has been broadened> ... The onslaught of information may be overwhelming, and they begin to mix> and confuse two or three realities.That is certainly what it felt like during those three crazy months beforesuddenly everything morphed back into clarity as the computer ‘unfroze’. Peoplewould say to me ‘I thought they said you’d gone mad, but you’re the same bloke Iused to know’. Well, I seemed to be outwardly, but I was now looking at theworld in a very different way. The waters breaking in my sense of reality werefreeing me from the prisonperceptions of this world of illusion and suddenly Icould see what most others could not. When that happens there can be no otherscenario than to be ridiculed and condemned and branded as insane when the wordthey are looking for is ‘different’. This has happened to so many others beforeme, although rarely, I suspect, on the same incessant and merciless scale. WhenI say that I began to see what most others could not, this is not meant to be aboast or a claim to some sort of specialness. My point has always been that weare all the same Infinite Awareness and that we are therefore all expressions ofthe same ‘specialness’. The breaking waters are open to anyone. It is only achoice to cast off the programmed perceptions of a lifetime in this world ofillusion and delusion where the prevailing reality is courtesy of Looney Tunes.I was said to be having a ‘breakdown’ by the reams of column inches writtenabout me in the early 1990s, but in truth I was having a breakthrough. So manypeople worldwide are going through the breakthrough process today and I want togive them encouragement and reassurance from my own extreme experience: You arenot going crazy. You are going sane. The British media still ridicules me in itstime-warp ignorance. To most journalists those three months in 1990 have neverended but I have moved on even if they haven’t. I have written around 20 booksand travelled to more than 50 countries researching and talking at public eventsand, as the world takes ever more blatantly the form that I described in earlierbooks, the interest in my work has exploded. Davidicke.com[http://www.Davidicke.com] is visited by millions every month and is ranked inthe top 600 sites in the UK, top 5,000 in the United States and top 6,500 in theworld on an Internet with the best part of 200 million active websites. Sixthousand people attended my event at the Wembley Arena in London in October 2012where I spoke for ten hours connecting the dots across the great interconnectedtapestry of life and tens of thousands more watched the event live on theInternet (Fig 6). We also launched a global Internet TV and radio station in2013 called The People’s Voice to bypass the mainstream media (see back ofbook). I hope that I have shown people that, no matter how bad and hopelessthings may look, you can survive and prosper if you are prepared to keep walkingin your chosen direction and never give up.[../Images/00254.jpg]Figure 6: The Wembley Arena 2012. So Icke was finished, eh?I had many mind-opening experiences when I revisited Peru in April 2012 andspent part of my 60th birthday on that hill overlooking Sillustani. It was sostrange to return and there was no longer an identifiable circle of stones. Ifound the spot where I stood with the same view across the lake to themountains, but not a circle which still bewilders me. The energy was stillincredibly powerful, though, and Peru remains a special place (Fig 7). Theexperience that stands out happened early one morning when I was in a hotel roompreparing to leave before sunrise to travel to the incredible ‘lost city’ ofMachu Picchu. I was walking out of the bathroom when suddenly I could not walkstraight. I lurched to the left like a drunk and for three or four minutes thiscontinued as I tried to walk in a straight line. I began to feel ill and aboutto faint and I remember thinking that I had to make it to the bed to lie down;but as I tried to move in that direction this truly weird experience ended asfast as it started and my ‘straightness’ returned. As I stood there, wonderingwhat the heck just happened, a ‘voice’ in my head said: ‘We have just flippedyour brain – you won’t be decoding reality in the same way from now on.’ Amedium friend, Monica Sepulveda, contacted me by email later that day fromCalifornia to say that she had a message for me: ‘Say goodbye to the thirddimension as you know it.’ I was certainly not in this reality for about an hourand a half after my experience. It was like I was in another ‘place’ lookinginto this world rather than being ‘in’ it. My point of observation or attentionhad moved from ‘here’ to somewhere else. My sense of reality significantlychanged for the rest of the trip, but even more so when I got home andthroughout the time since. Life became easier, calmer and insight just pouredinto my conscious mind.[../Images/00419.jpg]Figure 7: Energy of tremendous power passed through me on that Peruvian hillsideactivating awareness that had been dormant to this point. My mind was suddenlydeluged with information, concepts and insights.The day after I returned from Peru I began to write this book ... and here isthe result."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00549.jpg]Looks without seeing, listens without hearing, touches without feeling, eatswithout tasting, moves without physical awareness, inhales without awareness ofodour or fragrance, and talks without thinking.Leonardo da Vinci on the human mindThe world is clinically insane and we urgently need to understand this simpletruth. This has to be the starting point of any investigation into the nature oflife in this ‘reality’. Start anywhere else and the plot is already lost neverto be recovered. So here endeth the first lesson: the world is bloody mad ...potty, batty, cuckoo and completely off its rocker. A rocker has rarely everbeen so ‘off’.Once you realise this, life gets easier to deal with. It’s when need you try tomake sense of something that is insane that it really cooks your noodle andprojects you into a lifetime of jaw-dropping bewilderment. ‘It must be me’, Ihear people say. ‘The world can’t be that crazy, that stupid, that, well,clinically insane. It must be me.’ No, no. That’s the big mistake. It’s not you.The world is that crazy, that stupid, that, well, clinically insane. I would saythat we need an army of psychiatrists to sort it out, except that whenever Ihave encountered psychiatrists it has struck me that they were themselves inneed of help from their own profession. But then they do say that the best placeto hide a tree is in a forest. Imagine that you were born into a lunatic asylumand you grew up into adulthood behind walls that disconnected you from the restof the world. You would think that all the madness going on around you was‘normal’ because what we call ‘normal’ is really only a word for ‘what I havealways thought and known’. Nothing is more subjective than the concept of‘normal’. If someone came into the asylum and said that what went on there wascrazy and insane the inmates would say he or she was crazy for suggesting such athing. ‘We are the normal ones – it’s you that’s mad.’ The fact that so manythink that I am crazy is very comforting, really, for that very reason. Whocould challenge the contention that the world is an asylum when you observe theplace for even a few minutes? We have bankers lending us money that doesn’texist (‘credit’) and charging interest on it; we have doctors supposedly healingthe sick when the biggest killer in the United States is the treatment; werespond to cancer by killing the patient with chemotherapy and radiation whichdestroys the immune system and opens the door to even more cancer and much else;we have vaccines allegedly boosting the immune system when they are actuallydestroying it; we have scientists telling us how everything works when they havenot a clue about the true nature of reality and thus not a clue about howeverything works; we have teachers telling children and young people whatever aninsane and ignorant system dictates no matter how flawed and mendacious it maybe; we have men in frocks telling their congregations that all they need to knowis between the covers of a single book, the Bible, Koran, Talmud, whatever; evencrazier than that, we have billions believing them; we have political partiescompeting for office when behind the scenes all are controlled by the same force– which is why the same agenda unfolds no matter who is officially ingovernment; we eat and drink chemical poisons in food and water and most peopleappear to think that this is perfectly okay – ‘Hey, did you know that some nuttypeople say that there’s a difference between eating stuff that’s full ofchemical poisons and stuff that isn’t? They’re mad’; we havegenetically-modified food that is genetically-modifying us and yet most peoplenever even consider the possibility or the implications (Fig 8). I mean,genetically-modified food – helloooo); we have a media with no idea what isgoing on in the world telling us what is going on in the world; we have ourfreedoms constantly deleted to protect our freedoms; and we have civilianspepper-bombed from the sky to protect them from violence.[../Images/00292.jpg]Figure 8: Genetically-modified food anyone?We have reached the point where multi-millions of people are taking to thestreets around the world to protest at their economic plight as the gap betweenrich and poor becomes a chasm as (calculated) chaos in the financial system hasbeen used as the (calculated) excuse for the biggest transfer of wealth from themany to the few, from poor to rich, from masses to elite, in known humanhistory. Vast numbers are losing their homes and livelihoods while austerityprogrammes slash or delete ‘government’ (taxation) support for the poor and theyare left destitute with no safety net to protect them from this (calculated)heartlessness and contempt. Parents in countries like Greece are selling theirchildren or giving them away because they don’t have the money to feed them.Others are committing suicide because they see no hope, no way out. Thousands ofdisabled and elderly people are losing state-funded (taxpayer-funded) support inBritain as the rules on qualification for what constitutes being unfit to workare changed. At the same time the government is closing workplaces for thedisabled. A young man with cerebral palsy, learning difficulties and littlevision in one eye who cannot shave, wash his hair or tie his shoes was deniedhis just eleven hours of weekly care by his local council, which cited lack ofmoney. But, to the hidden networks manipulating global society, these people arejust ‘useless eaters’ and therefore irrelevant. We have had people in the UKwith advanced cancer forced back to work by threats of stopping benefits only todie within six weeks and others, similarly forced back to work, suffering fromseizures and dying within months. Others have committed suicide, including amentally-ill teenager in fear of being made homeless by benefit cuts. MartineWhite is a 50-year-old victim of the morning sickness drug, Thalidomide, whichcaused severe birth defects. She is suffering from a brain tumour, she’s blindin one eye and has deformed arms, she struggles to walk and was facing spinalsurgery which could put her permanently in a wheelchair; but the sick, cruel andmerciless UK government ruled that she had to seek employment or face losinghalf her benefits. Martine said: ‘It is impossible. I can’t walk properly, Ican’t stand, I can’t pick things up, I get dizzy with the brain tumour and I’mblind in one eye and deaf in both ears. It is depressing. What am I going todo?’ They don’t give a damn, Martine, because they are heartless, soullessautomatons.More than half of Britain’s children and young people are projected to live inhomes with incomes ‘below in the breadline’ by 2015 because of welfare cuts, taxrises and wage freezes. The people doing all this are mentally ill and yet theyare running the country. Amid economic mayhem and plummeting employmentopportunities in the UK the callous Work and Pensions Secretary Iain DuncanSmith was appointed to government to pummel the poorest and most vulnerable ontotheir knees. This professional prat added the middle name Duncan to make himselfsound more ‘double-barreled’ posh. He lives on a country estate, thanks to hisaristocratic father-in-law, and he told the poor to ‘get a job at the minimumwage’ to get themselves and their children out of poverty. Foreign SecretaryWilliam Hague, who my mind always pictures in short trousers and a school capwhenever I see him, said that people must ‘work harder’ to overcome economichardship. Both of these pampered politicians are filthy rich compared with thosethey lecture about the need for austerity and working harder, and the samedynamic can be found all over the world because in the end virtually everycountry is dictated to and directed by the same global web. Puppets like Smith,Hague, Cameron, Blair, Bush and Obama are just gofers to their hidden mastersthat the public never see. We are clearly heading into the world of brutal masscontrol that I have so long predicted – if we go on allowing the evil few todictate to the bewildered many. Those behind this outrage don’t suffer regret orguilt at the mass suffering they are causing – they are orgasmic for reasonsthat I will be exposing. Incredible numbers of small farmers in regions likeAsia are killing themselves in the wake of their financial destruction at thehands of corporations like Monsanto. A major reason is the financial consequenceof Monsanto’s ‘terminator’ seeds which have only a single season before havingto be bought again when originally one season’s crops provided the seeds for thenext. Farmers in North America have been ruined by being taken to court byMonsanto for using its genetically-modified seeds without a licence when theseeds arrived on the wind or from passing trucks carrying genetically-modifiedcrops and contaminated farms that had no wish to grow genetically-modifiedorganisms (GMO). The fact that Monsanto has been winning these cases isconfirmation of how the corporations control much of the so-called ‘justice’system which is rigged against the people in every country. The AmericanPresident can now order the murder of any US citizen anywhere in the world onthe basis of his say-so – no evidence, charge or trial required; any Americancan be jailed indefinitely without charge or trial. If you think I’mexaggerating – look it up. It’s the law now. Thousands of civilians and childrenare being killed across North Africa and the Middle and Near East by unmannedaircraft, or drones, flown by joysticks at Air Force bases thousands of milesaway in strikes ordered once again without producing evidence, charges or anyjustification except ‘we decide who lives and dies’. Children are being stolenfrom loving parents by a fundamentally corrupt social services, child protectionand family court system, using fabricated excuses, because the hidden networksbehind global affairs have an insatiable desire for children for reasons I willcome to. The world is very, very sick because we have allowed a parasitic cancerto steal and feed off our life-force, labour and creativity – and we need tosort it and fast. What’s more, this is only a very partial list of globalcraziness and horror. The world is not clinically insane?? Are you kidding me?It is the planetary equivalent of Hannibal bloody Lecter (Fig 9). This quote byauthor Michael Ellner sums it up:[../Images/00202.jpg]Figure 9: Hannibal Earth - the world is mad, but you have to be sane to seethat.> Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, psychiatrists destroy minds,> scientists destroy truth, major media destroys information, religions destroy> spirituality and governments destroy freedom.There is a callous, calculated and collective reason for why this is so, which Iwill be revealing in dot-connected detail throughout the book. The world isupside down because it is made to be. Increasing numbers of people can now seethat what is happening is not random and coincidental, and they are awakening toself-realisation and world-realisation in the sense that they are seeing thatthe world is not as it is by accident or through incompetence, but by design. Ohyes, there are incompetents throughout system, but they are the oil rags, notthe engineers of what is going on. They carry out orders, they don’t give them,except to those below them in the hierarchy; but even then the orders they dogive originate from levels of the structure that they don’t even know exist.Everything is compartmentalised, ‘need-to-know’ and smoke and mirrors. What wesee is not random chaos, but organised ‘chaos’, organised ‘incompetence’,organised depravation and suffering. I will be explaining the how, why and bywhom, but enough to say here that world events cannot be understood unless werealise that they are orchestrated to the calculated end of mass planetary humanenslavement. The more the world changes ever-quicker for the worst, the moreobvious that this is becoming, even to former sceptics.People talk about ‘conspiracy theorists’ as if to even utter the word conspiracyis to confirm your imbalance and paranoia. But the definition of ‘conspiracy’ ismerely this: ‘An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, orsubversive act’ and ‘an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crimeor accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action’. Under those definitionsthe world is clearly drowning in conspiracies. And who can be more delusionalthan the ‘coincidence theorists’ who say that it’s all a coincidence that thesame Orwellian police state in all its multiple manifestations is being rolledout in virtually every country at the same time using the same excuses? Now thatis denial and self-deceit of breathtaking proportions. The world is mad becauseit is made to be that way. There is method in the madness. It is still madnessin that you have to be loopy and deeply imbalanced to do what they are seekingto do, but the point is that they know what they are doing. They are not crazieswho thrash out in all directions for no reason. There is cold calculation atwork and the apparently random craziness all around us is the essential cover tohide the orchestration behind gathering human slavery. I was like Neo in theMatrix movies for most of my life until my awakening in 1990. I looked at theworld and knew something was deeply wrong, but the question was what exactly? Icould see that it was crazy, cruel and unjust, but why – where did the crazycome from? As Morpheus said to Neo:> You’re here because you know something. What you know you can’t explain, but> you feel it. You’ve felt it your entire life, that there’s something wrong> with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there, like a splinter in> your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me.So many people today are at that stage where they can see that something isseriously amiss with the world, but they can’t put their finger on the what andthe why. This engineered bewilderment was referred to in a document that came tolight some decades ago called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, an instructionmanual for agents of the conspiracy explaining how to mass mind control thepopulation. The document was dated May 1979 and was apparently found in July1986 in an IBM copier bought at a surplus sale. The quiet wars it talks aboutare the unseen wars on the human mind and the silent weapons are mental andemotional manipulations based on manufacturing situations to which the mind andemotions respond. The document describes the diversion strategy which includes:> Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social> issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance; Schools: Keep the> young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real> history; Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade> level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on> the farm with the other animals.Anyone recognise that world today? The document says that a silent weapon systemoperates with data ‘obtained from a docile public by legal (but not alwayslawful) force’. Much of this information is made available to silent weaponsystems programmers through the tax system, it says, in the form of the enforceddelivery of well-organised data contained in federal and state tax documents,‘collected, assembled, and submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers andemployers’. It also made the following point all those decades ago and this isprecisely what is happening today:> When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without> just compensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender> and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily> quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay> income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the> government.[../Images/00067.jpg]Figure 10: The human hierarchy.Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars describes how it is necessary in pursuit ofcollective enslavement to achieve ‘the consent of the people to labor andconsequently assume a certain rank, position, level, or class in the socialstructure, i.e., to provide labor at various levels in the pecking order’ (knowyour place). The document says that then each class, in guaranteeing its ownlevel of income, controls the class immediately below and hence preserves theclass structure (Fig 10). ‘This provides stability and security, but alsogovernment from the top’. It identifies a threat to the ‘sovereignty of theelite’ of the lower classes becoming more educated and demanding more of whatthe elite have, but ‘if this rise of the lower classes can be postponed longenough, the elite can achieve energy dominance, and labor by consent no longerwill hold a position of an essential energy source’. In other words, theyreplace the labour of the people with technology and then the people can go fuckthemselves. We are heading to that point so fast today. The writers of thedocument say that ‘until such energy dominance is absolutely established, theconsent of people to labor and letting others handle their affairs must be takeninto consideration, since failure to do so could cause the people to interferein the final transfer of energy sources to the control of the elite’. They saythat it is essential to recognise that public consent was still an essential key(at the time it was written) to the release of energy in the process of‘economic amplification’ (stealing the world).So, as I have been urging for more than 20 years and even before that: it isessential that we withdraw our consent to all this en masse. The document saidof this ‘quiet war’ on the human psyche:> It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing,> instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,> instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by> a computer programmer, instead of marksman; under the orders of a banking> magnate, instead of a military general.> It makes no obvious explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental> injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone’s daily social life.> Yet it makes an unmistakable ‘noise’, causes unmistakable physical and mental> damage, and unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable> to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot> comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being> attacked and subdued by a weapon.> The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but because of> the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling> in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do> not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to> defend themselves against it.> When a silent weapon is applied gradually to the public, the public> adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on> their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great> and they crack up.> Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the> vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing,> understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social> energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.This is exactly what it has done and is doing today more so than ever before.They thought we’d never crack the codes of their game or even realise there wasa game; but in this book I am going to reveal what is wrong, why it’s wrong andwho and what is behind this war on human perception. I am also going to explainhow people can ‘associate with others to defend themselves against it’. All thishas been shown to me in the nearly a quarter of a century since I walked intothe house of psychic Betty Shine and the clues began to be put before me in themost incredibly synchronistic way. I have been led to people, documents, booksand personal experiences that have guided me deep into the rabbit hole of humancontrol and connected an endless stream of apparently unconnected people, eventsand situations, ancient and modern, across so many different cultures andsubject areas. I was to realise that all were strands in the same tapestry andthe same web and pieces in the same picture. Most importantly, I have been shownthe nature of reality itself and only then was I able to see this crazy world inits true context – why it’s crazy, how it’s crazy and to what end. Humanity isbasically unconscious and there is a reason for that which will become veryclear. I have had to delete all preconceived ideas about life and reality andlet the information be my guide, because once you break free from conventional(programmed) thought and perception you find yourself dealing with someapparently crazy information from the perspective of the prescribed ‘norms’. Butwhat are these political, scientific and academic ‘norms’? They are merely whatsociety – the Control System that directs society – has told you are the‘norms.’ They have nothing to do with truth, for their goal is the enslavementof mind through ignorance of the truth. This is why I say it’s all bollocks. The‘bollocks’ are the norms designed to keep us from the truth and, as our societyis founded on those ‘norms’, it therefore must be founded on bollocks. If youtry to understand human life from any other perspective then you will be chasingyour tail forever. It’s all bollocks, that’s the first thing; and the second isthat it doesn’t have to be. So why is it? The answer, with a heck of a lot moredetail necessary, was given by Morpheus in The Matrix:> The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room.> You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your> television. You can feel it when you go to work ... when you go to church ...> when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes> to blind you from the truth.> What truth?> That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Born> into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.Oh yes, absolutely right. But what is the Matrix? How does it affect us? Howdoes it make the world so utterly bonkers? The world is like it is – insane –because of what I am about to tell you. The information comes from nearly 25years of ‘following the clues’ full-time on a journey that has included morethan 50 countries and so many amazing experiences. But you will have to decidewhat to make of it and what it challenges you to encompass. As Morpheus alsosaid: ‘I’m trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door.You’re the one that has to walk through it ...’This is as it should always be: the free choice of a free mind."},{"pageContent":"Part 1"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00395.jpg]The Dog’s BollocksThere are three classes of people: those who see; those who see when they areshown; those who do not see.Leonardo da VinciLanguage can be so strange. You can have china with a lower-case ‘c’ and itmeans cups and saucers; but with an upper-case ‘C’ it becomes the most populatedcountry on Earth controlled by a bunch of vicious thugs wearing silly uniforms,senile grins and cropped hair. In the same way, bollocks has the slangconnotation of nonsense and stupidity, but put ‘the dog’s’ in front of it andthe meaning is transformed into something to be admired, welcomed and soughtafter.‘The dog’s bollocks’ (see also ‘pooches’ privates’ and ‘mutt’s nuts‘) is a slangphrase meaning excellent, great, top class. Go figure. No one seems to know why,but apparently it comes from a list of terms involving the joints, bed-wear anddangly bits of animals and insects that include the cat’s pyjamas, cat’swhiskers and bee’s knees. I don’t care where it comes from. I like it and I amusing it to head the sequence of chapters which I contend reveal the cuttingedge information essential to understanding why and how the world is as it isand what we can do about it. This dog’s bollocks information is about the natureof our reality and without this knowledge our view of the world will remainforever distorted. This is why the Control System that I will be exposing indetail has worked so long and hard to suppress it – especially within mainstream‘science’ because by doing so they keep the information out of the mainstreammedia (which perceives the bewildered scientific establishment as allknowing)and so out of mainstream society. Here’s a question: how many televisionprogrammes anywhere in the world have you seen that have explored the nature ofreality? There are now reams of channels in every country covering almost everysubject you can think of and yet those that seek to explain reality itself arevirtually the Big Zero. Why? Don’t we want to know what this reality is that weare experiencing? Isn’t such an understanding rather crucial to how we determinethe nature of that experience and how we live our lives? Yes, it is, and that’swhy it is suppressed at every turn. Once we know who we really are, where wereally are, and how one creates the other, we have the power to dictate ourdaily experience. This is the last thing the Control System wants. Dictating ourlives is its job, or so it believes. We have to be kept in ignorance of our truenature or the house of cards comes a tumbling down. The Control System hastherefore become expert at suppressing this awareness – so much so that howoften do you ever hear people in mainstream society even talking about thesubject or asking the key questions: Who are we? Where are we? Where do we comefrom?[../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 11: A condensed portayal of the inside of what science calls an atom. Butthe distances are massively greater than this - ‘If you take an atom to be thesize of a cathedral the nucleus would be the size of a ten cent piece.’It is hilarious to watch mainstream ‘science’ at work. They go about theirbusiness as if we live in a solid reality of buildings, cities, forests andmountains when they know – if they read even a basic synopsis of quantum physics– that this is nonsensical. There is no such thing as solidity, only theillusion of it. Quantum physicists have proven this and in doing so confirmedwhat native peoples and awakened individuals have known since pre-history. Theworld is not ‘solid’. No, not even the wall you might be looking at or the bookyou are reading. Mainstream science tells us that ‘solid’ matter is made ofatoms when quantum physics has long established that atoms have no solidity.Each atom is made of ‘empty’ space with electrons flying around a nucleus whichitself has no solidity (Fig 11). Scientists say that 99.99999 percent of an atomis ‘empty space’ and the almost nothing that is left is energy. Solidity isnowhere to be seen. One description said: ‘If you take an atom to be the size ofa cathedral the nucleus would be the size of a ten cent piece.’ But the nucleusand electrons are also only packets of energy with no solidity, and atoms withno solidity cannot a solid world make. I know this is stating the obvious, butsometimes you need to. Mainstream ‘science’ and its white-coated, song sheetrepeaters of the official narrative overcome the rather revelatory fact that theworld is not solid by looking the other way, putting their hands over theirears; making a loud noise to drown out what they don’t want to hear and crackingon regardless within their own ‘discipline’ as if nothing has changed. Now,given that human society in all its facets is founded on the belief that theworld is solid you can see how everything which emerges from that in terms ofhow we do things, organise ourselves and go about our lives must, by definition,be the aforementioned bollocks, because the foundations on which it is allconstructed are built on the ever-shifting sands of perpetual bollocks. Distortthe foundations of something and you distort everything that follows from it.This includes the widespread belief that the human body is ‘solid’, or‘physical’. No, it’s not. There is no physical. From this distorted perceptionof body solidity comes the solidification of belief that we are the body; thename that we give to the body; the job the body does and its colour, creed orculture of origin. Implant the prime distortion and you tip over the dominoes toimpregnate everything else with knock-on distortions. Smack a mirror at thecentre and the cracks break off in all directions. So does bollocks. The ‘smack’is a belief in a world of solidity and the whole of society becomes cracked – orcrack-potted – from this prime distortion. A belief in physicality and solidityis a belief right from the start in limitation. There is so much that cannot bedone and isn’t possible if the world is solid. I can’t, you can’t, it can’t andit’s not possible are built into the very illusory solidity of perceivedsolidity. The entirety of mainstream society is founded on this fundamentaluntruth and that’s why we can rearrange the words ‘bollocks’, ‘all’ and ‘it’s’,into a well-known phrase or saying to pretty much sum it up. So if the world isnot solid, what is it? Where are we? Who are we? What’s going on? The ControlSystem is designed to stop us knowing this, so we have to discover it forourselves. When the penny drops on who we are and where we are the current stateof human society will be understood with instant clarity. Life ‘on’ Earth isbased on a gigantic lie, an enormous and fundamental hoax, and from this Big Liecomes all the many and various expressions of the lie that together create whatI shall call collectively The Bollocks Distortion.[../Images/00325.jpg]Figure 12: We are like the crest of a wave – we may seem different and‘individual’ but we are all an expression of the Infinite Ocean of Consciousness...[../Images/00423.jpg]Figure 13: ... our sense of individuality is merely our point of attention.So who are we?Okay, here’s a new starting point, a new foundation for perception, although itis not ‘new’, it has just been systematically forgotten: What we are isConsciousness. What is Consciousness? Awareness – the state of being aware. Ithas no form in and of itself, it just IS. But it can take illusory form.Awareness or Consciousness is infinite and eternal, but when there is no time(another illusion, explained later) how can anything be anything, but eternal?Indeed, within a reality of no-time even the word ‘eternal’ is superfluous – asis ‘infinite’ within a reality of no ‘space’ (also explained in due course). Iwill employ these words only to explain within the narrow confines of humanlanguage the basic themes which I am setting out to communicate. Awareness orConsciousness is the only state that truly exists. The only certainty iseternity – all the rest is what Consciousness chooses to create and experiencewithin that eternity, that infinity. Imagine one single Infinite Consciousnessexperiencing itself. You, me, everything are that Infinite Consciousness – everyplant, tree, insect, breath of air and drop of rain. We may look different, butwe are expressions of the same ocean of Consciousness. The white crests of oceanwaves look different to the rest of the ocean, but they are still the same ocean(Figs 12 and 13). What makes us feel ‘individual’ is our point of observation,our point of attention, within this infinite eternity. The point of attentionfor almost everyone ‘on’ Earth is that they are their name, job, life story,income bracket, age, colour, creed or religion. Ask most people who they are andthey will say something like:> I am Betty Jones, an American bank cashier born in Colorado, brought up in> Kansas and I had my 41st birthday last fall. I am a Baptist and my saviour is> Jesus.> Or ...> I am Bob Phillips and I work for a supermarket in Manchester – I am 38,> married with two children, and come from an ethnic minority of African origin.How often, if ever, have you heard anyone reply to the same question with: ‘I amInfinite Awareness having an experience called Betty Jones, a bank cashier bornin Colorado?’ Or, even more simply: ‘I am Infinite Awareness’? But that is thetruth. What we believe ourselves to ‘be’ – our sense of self-identity – isactually only what ‘we’ (points of attention within Infinite Awareness) areexperiencing. ‘I’m a doctor’. No, you’re not. You are Infinite Awareness havingan experience called a doctor. ‘I am a bus driver’. No you’re not. You areInfinite Awareness having an experience called a bus driver, and so on. Theconditioning (programming) begins almost immediately as we leave the womb (intruth even before) as parents tell us who we are on the basis of what theControl System has told them they are. Layer after layer of self-identity andperception programming then continues to be applied through school, university,peer pressure, group-think and media in all its forms. No wonder most ofhumanity is living a false self-identity that is nothing more than a programmedconstruct akin to a computer responding to downloaded software while believingit to be ‘real’. But then, the computer analogy is extremely appropriate. Thehuman body is a highly advanced biological computer system that allowsexpressions of Infinite Awareness (points of attention) to experience this‘world’, this reality, which is nothing more than a band of frequency withinInfinite Possibility (Fig 14). Most people think that when they look ‘through’their eyes that they are seeing all there is to see at their particular‘location’ when in fact they are ‘seeing’ (actually decoding) only a tiny rangeof frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum and known as ‘visible light’.And when I say ‘tiny’, I mean tiny. According to some scientists, theelectromagnetic spectrum makes up only 0.005 percent of what exists in theuniverse as mass/matter. Visible light, the only frequency range that we cansee, is a fraction even of that 0.005 percent (Figs 15 and 16). Some say thatthe percentage of electromagnetic activity is a little more, but not much (Fig17). The rest, they say, consists of what they call ‘dark matter’ or ‘darkenergy’. They call it ‘dark’ because we can’t see it. I don’t buy the detailedtheory behind dark matter and I prefer to keep it simple by talking about thevisible universe and the invisible universe. The point is that virtually theentire universe and everything beyond is invisible to human sight and technologyand this is just one universe within infinite numbers of universes and realitieswithin Infinite Awareness – Infinite Possibility. When you tune your televisionor radio to a particular channel or station that is the one you experience. Youdon’t see and hear all the others, even though they exist together on differentfrequencies within the same reality. You only access the one that is beingdecoded. It is the same with the biological receiver-transmitter and computersystem that we call the human body. It focusses our attention on the narrow bandof frequency called visible light and so that is what we perceive andexperience. But all around us in the same ‘space’ are all the other realities inother frequency bands (and none) that make up what we call ‘Creation’(Fig 18).We only see something when light is reflected from it and anything that does notreflect light is invisible to us even though it may ‘exist’. Everything in ourreality relates to the interaction or otherwise of encoded information withinthe electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic field that we call glass(crystal) allows light to pass through, as with windows, but the electromagneticfield that we call a wall absorbs some visible light and reflects the rest –thus when we are enclosed by walls with no windows we are in darkness – theabsence of visible light as we perceive it.[../Images/00507.jpg]Figure 14: The Body-Mind computer and receiver-transmitter connects our point ofattention to a tiny range of frequency that we perceive as ‘the world’.> [../Images/00499.jpg]> Figure 15: What we can ‘see’ (decode) is an infinitesimal fraction of what> exists.> [../Images/00081.jpg]> Figure 16: I don’t agree with the ‘dark matter’, ‘dark energy’ concept of> mainstream science except in the sense that all but a smear of existence is> invisible to us.[../Images/00140.jpg]Figure 17: Humans are basically blind.[../Images/00150.jpg]Figure 18: Humanity perceives so little yet thinks it knows so much.So let us recap for a second, for it will be sobering to do so. What we call‘the world’ is only a tiny range of frequency called visible light, anincredibly narrow band within the larger, but still fundamentally limited,electromagnetic spectrum. What humans can ‘see’ is an infinitesimal fraction ofwhat there is to see. The vehicle which focusses human attention on merelyvisible light is called a ‘body’. This focus is imposed by the simple fact thatthe decoding and information receiver-transmitter systems of the brain andDNA/genetic structure only manifest ‘reality’ for what we call the consciousmind within the frequency band of visible light. This genetically-decoded focusof perceived reality is what people call a ‘human’ and they mistake this fortheir true self. It is not. It is merely a focus of attention within theirInfinite Awareness. It is their ‘ocean’ focusing attention on a droplet andbelieving for a temporary ‘three score years and ten’ that the droplet is thetrue self and not the ocean. Searching for consciousness inside the brain islike looking inside a radio for the guy playing the music. It makes me chucklewhen I see people ridiculing the existence of other realities, and othermanifestations of Infinite Possibility such as the non-human entities that Italk about, when they can’t even see other levels of their own reality like theultraviolet, infrared and radio wave segments of the electromagnetic field.Hilarious, really. What self-delusion, what ‘scientific’ nonsense. Human societyis based on the world being solid when it isn’t and on us seeing through oureyes all that there is to see when in truth we can see (decode) only a tinyfraction of what there is to see. To put it bluntly, we can ‘see’ next to fuckall. No wonder it’s all bollocks. How could it be anything else when the veryfoundations of how we think we perceive reality are so illusory and mistaken?Body of KnowledgeThe human body is a biological computer system and by ‘biological’ I mean thatit is a living organism capable of assessing data and responding to that data. Adesktop computer responds according to the way it is programmed to respond, buta biological computer of the advancement of the human body has an awareness thatcan make decisions based on input and experience. The human immune system is aperfect example. You don’t have to tell your immune system to do this or that,it is constantly scanning the operating system for imbalances, distortions andthreats and then taking what it believes to be the most appropriate action. Itis the body’s anti-virus software and, as with conventional anti-virustechnology, it can fail to deal with an attack from something for which it hasno experience (relevant data). A new computer virus can breach anti-virusfirewalls and, in the same way, Native Americans went down like flies when theEuropean invaders brought smallpox with them for which Native American immunesystems had no ‘software’ and so no effective response. Some universities aroundthe world are apparently in the process of developing biological computers basedon the principle of data assessment and decision-making rather than beinglimited only to programmed reaction. We need a biological vehicle to experiencethis ‘world’ – this frequency band called visible light – because our Awarenessis vibrating or resonating too quickly to directly interact with this reality.The core of it is not resonating at all, as I will be coming to later. Imaginetwo radio or television stations on different parts of the frequency band. Theycan’t interact or communicate because they are on different frequencies andnever the twain shall meet. It is the same with our Consciousness or Awareness.If I am going to tap these keys and you are going to hold this book, ‘we’(Consciousness/Awareness) need to take on an outer shell that resonates withinthe frequency range that we wish to experience. This shell or vehicle is thehuman body or biological computer. What the hidden Control System seeks to do –and is very effective in doing – is to make us self-identify with the bodyvehicle rather than the true self, our Consciousness which is experiencingthrough the vehicle. Therefore, we are programmed from birth to identify selfwith the body and its name, job, colour, race, etc., etc. Once we do that –gotcha (Fig 19).[../Images/00228.jpg]Figure 19: We self-identify with a fraction of who we really are.I make the clear distinction between what I call Body-Mind (the biologicalcomputer and its energetic expression known as the human auric field) andConsciousness/Awareness (the true, Infinite and eternal self that extends beyondthe electromagnetic spectrum). You can symbolise the relationship between themas being like a desktop computer (Body-Mind) and the person (Consciousness) atthe mouse and keyboard (Figs 20 and 21). Body-Mind is supposed to be a vehiclefor Consciousness to experience this reality and when the body is responding tothe impulses of Consciousness via the symbolic mouse and keyboard (throughintuition, knowing) everything is fine. You have Body-Mind directly interactingwith the world, but it is responding to the wisdom and awareness ofConsciousness that knows the big picture within which everything is happening.You are in this world (Body-Mind), but not of it (Consciousness). The goal ofthe Control System is to disconnect Body-Mind from Consciousness by attractingour point of attention into Body-Mind (the five senses) at the exclusion ofeverything else. If we succumb to that, ‘we’, our point of attention, are bothin this world and of it. This is the mega gotcha. Now, without the wisdom andbig picture influence of Consciousness, you have only Body-Mind to work thingsout. The problem is that Body-Mind is first grade compared with Consciousnessand at this point the Cult of the Lost and Bewildered has yet another recruit.Body-Mind is in this world and of this world and so it has no other point ofreference except this world. It sees and hears what the Control System tells itto see and hear through the education (reality-programming) system, the media(reality-programming), and family, friends, scientists and academics(reality-programmed reality programmers). It has indeed all got so confusingthat human life is largely about becoming programmed and then programmingothers, or insisting that they must be as programmed as you are (conforming tothe manipulated – programmed – ‘consensus’). This is why the programmed majoritycall you mad or dangerous when you have a different reality or sense of self tothe ‘norm’ (program). They resent the fact that you are not accepting theirmass-mind program as the only reality and questioning the very possibility thatthey may not have made the right call. People don’t want to think that they areprogrammed and so they convince themselves they are not. Many react aggressivelyor dismissively to those with a more expanded sense of reality because itreminds them subconsciously of their own programming. There are none so enslavedas those who falsely believe they are free. It can start at the earliest age,too. Look at what happens to even a young child at school if they are differentfrom the herd in any way.[../Images/00327.jpg]Figure 20: Humans are Infinite Consciousness but think they are their name, job,race and income bracket. The computer operator thinks he is the computer.[../Images/00358.jpg]Figure 21: When we retain or regain our awareness of true self we are ‘in’ this‘world’ but not ‘of’ it. We can see the illusion for what it is because ourrange of perception expands beyond the illusion.Being ‘born’ (logging on)The computer analogy is very apt in so many respects and most important amongthem is the way that Body-Mind decodes reality. People think they live in a‘physical’ universe, but they don’t. There is no physical. The foundation of theuniverse is not the ‘physical’ that we think we see, but an energeticinformation construct very much the same in principle as the wireless Internet.When you are somewhere with Wi-Fi, how do you know it’s there? Okay, the café orwhatever may have a little sign saying so, but what if the little sign wasn’tthere? How would you know? You can’t see the wireless Internet and without acomputer you can’t confirm its existence. If the wireless Internet existed, butthere were no computers to ‘prove it’, you would be called mad if you suggestedthat the Internet was all around us. ‘You’re crazy; you’re telling me thatsomething exists that I can’t see.’ Would that be the same ‘me’ that can onlydecode an infinitesimal fraction of the universe and thus ‘see’ the alreadymentioned next-to-fuck-all? You know, I do believe it would. People are sofunny. A Chinese saying has one fish asking another: ‘Do you believe in thisocean that they talk about?’ I saw a cartoon image on the Internet that alsocaptured the theme (Fig 22). The universe is a tapestry of resonating waveforminformation fields beyond visible light from which we decode information and towhich we also ‘post’ information with our thoughts and emotions – once again intheme with the wireless Internet. I call this waveform construct theMetaphysical Universe or the Cosmic Internet (Fig 23). Waveform can storeextraordinary amounts of information and everything that we ‘see’ is decodedfrom this waveform level of the universe into the reality that is called visiblelight – the ‘world’ of the so-called conscious mind. The five senses of sight,hearing, touch, smell and taste are decoding systems. They turn waveforminformation into electrical information that is communicated to the brain which,together with the whole genetic structure, decodes the electrical into thedigital and holographic (illusory ‘physical’). It is the same information at allthese stages, but takes a different form (Fig 24). What scientists call atomsare energetic expressions of this decoding process and so they have no need tobe solid to contribute to a world that isn’t solid. But don’t we bang our headif we try to walk through a wall? And have you ever tried to put your handthrough a concrete block? True, but the resistance does not come from solidity.It is caused by the meeting of two different electromagnetic fields – isenergetic resistance that we only decode to appear like ‘physical’ resistance.There are very high states of Consciousness which can override this and so walkthrough walls – an electromagnetic field walking through an electromagneticfield. When people see ‘ghosts’ pass through walls it is because the frequencyof the ‘ghost’ is so far from the frequency of the wall that neither exist inthe other’s reality. It then becomes like two radio stations sharing the same‘space’ without interfering with each other.[../Images/00151.jpg]Figure 22: They could be humans talking.[../Images/00359.jpg]Figure 23: The waveform or Metaphysical Universe. The foundation informationfield within our reality is waveform.[../Images/00427.jpg]Figure 24: Waveform information fields are decoded through the electrical anddigital levels to the holographic – illusory ‘physical’ – world of the consciousmind.[../Images/00392.jpg]Figure 25: The world is in your ‘head’. The brain decodes electrical informationinto a holographic illusory reality and the brain, too, is a holographic versionof waveform information.Ears are the most obvious waveform/vibration decoders in that they transformsound wave information into electrical information which is communicated to thebrain. Only when the brain decodes this do we actually ‘hear’ anything. Or ...He that hath ears to hear, let him decode. When someone is talking to us we heartheir words, but what they are communicating only exists in that form in ourheads. What passes between their ‘mouth’ and our ears is not words, butvibrational or waveform information generated by their vibrating vocal chords.While the hearing example may be the most obvious, all the five senses operatein the same way. When we get a bang on the leg (sense of touch) we don’t say‘ouch’ until the electrical information has been communicated from the point ofimpact for the brain to decode. When my son, Gareth, had an operation on abroken leg the pain specialist said that they would block the messages from thebreak to the brain to ease the pain. If the brain doesn’t decode pain then wecan’t feel it and the same with all information received by the five senses. Thetongue decodes waveform information, but it’s the brain that says ‘Mmmmm’ or‘ugh’. This is why there are different parts of the brain that specialise indecoding input from particular senses (Fig 25). These different ‘parts’ of thebrain (and the brain, body and universe in general) are all waveform informationfields decoded by other waveform information fields into holographic (illusory)‘physicality’. I’ll come to the holographic principle shortly and it will openthe way for a vastly greater understanding of ‘physical’ reality for those whoare new to the concept. The brain, with its billions of neurons connected bytrillions of synapses, is a decoding grid of receiving and transmittinginformation. An article in Wonderpedia magazine said:> Every second 11 million sensations crackle along these pathways on their way> into a highly complex structure. The brain is confronted with an alarming> array of images, sounds, and smells which it rigorously filters down until it> is left with a manageable list of around 40. Thus 40 sensations per second> make up what we perceive as reality.The brain brings into conscious reality only 40 sensory impressions out of every11 million. It is worth taking that in for a moment. Round this up to a minute’sworth of reality and it is constructed by the brain with 2,400 impressions froma possible 660 million and it obviously gets more fantastic the higher you go.How can people possibly think they know what is going on when we perceive such afraction of what there is to perceive? We are seeing 40 impressions a second outof 11 million and ‘seeing’ a tiny band of frequency that is an estimated 0.005percent of what exists in the universe (but it is actually far less even thanthat). The brain is able to make the 40 impressions appear to be a seamlessreality because it fills in the gaps itself by what it thinks should be there. Asimple example is when you have written a sentence with a word missing but youread it back as if it was there because the brain is filling in the gap withwhat it knows should be there. Someone else comes along who hasn’t written thesentence and they will often see the missing word because their brain is not soclosely associated with the word arrangement. This is why books have to be readby a proofreader before they go to print. The gaps and perceptions are alsofilled in and constructed from a person’s memory, emotional state, desires andbeliefs and so two people looking at the same scene can have very differentperceptions of what they are seeing (decoding). You can also see the validity ofthe words spoken by the child in The Matrix when he was describing how a spoonwas bent (Fig 26):> ‘Do not try and bend the spoon. That’s impossible. Instead ... only try to> realize the truth.’ ‘ What truth?’ ‘> There is no spoon.’> ‘There is no spoon?’> ‘Then you’ll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.’[../Images/00333.jpg]Figure 26: The world is in your ‘head’. The brain decodes electrical informationinto a holographic illusory reality and the brain, too, is a holographic versionof waveform information.We don’t see reality as it is, but as we are and the Control System worksthroughout our lives to program our sense of reality to dictate our experiencedreality. More than 80 percent of the information from which the brain constructsreality is sourced through the visual senses and this is why symbols and imagesare far more important to programming perception than sound and words and othersenses. What we call ‘physical’ reality and a ‘solid’ world only exists in thebrain when waveform information has been decoded into the holographic illusionthat we call ‘human life’. The universe is information – encoded information anddecoded information in the same way that you drop in a software disk(information encoded to be decoded) and the disk is decoded by the computer(information encoded to decode information) into a ‘reality’ on the screen (Fig27). A television tube directs a stream of electrons at the screen in aparticular sequence and the brain decodes the pixels formed on the screen intoperceivable still images and connects them in a way that produces the illusionof movement. The Body-Mind computer does the same with reality in general bydecoding the waveform into its electrical, digital and holographic expressions.Without these innate abilities of the brain there could be no television and noreality as we currently experience it. We live ‘in’ the cosmic equivalent of avirtual reality ‘game’, a simulation, and this scene in The Matrix is based onfact when Morpheus explains reality to Neo:[../Images/00332.jpg]Figure 27: The understanding that unlocks the ‘mysteries’.> What is real? How do you define ‘real’? If you’re talking about what you can> feel, what you can smell, taste and see, then ‘real’ is simply electrical> signals interpreted by your brain.Precisely. What’s more, the way those signals are interpreted can be externallymanipulated – and they are on a scale that most people could not begin tocomprehend. More about that as we go along. The room that you are sitting ‘in’or the landscape you ‘see’ all around you only exists in that form in yourhead/mind. You are not in the room – the room is in you. The apparentlyoutside-of-you perception of the ‘world’ is all illusion. The brain iscompletely without light and only interacts with the illusory ‘external’ world’by being constantly fed an electrical copy of waveform/vibrational ‘light’information. A pitch black brain allows us to apparently ‘see’ light because itdecodes that reality from the electrical information source. What we call ‘life’is only an exploration of our own mind or awareness and for this reason ourperceptions of reality become our experienced reality. You don’t like your life?Then imagine something else. We can only be ill or age because we allow thatreality to manifest in the few cubic centimetres in the back of the brain whereour visual reality is decoded into illusory form. Virtual reality computertechnology is now being used for everything from entertainment to trainingsimulations and it is getting ever closer to mirroring the reality that weexperience as daily life. But, then, how does this technology work? It hacks into the very five senses that are decoding waveform reality into ‘human life’ andfeeds those senses an alternative source of information to decode into asimulated experience. The most sophisticated of this technology hacks into thesight decoding process through the goggles and the touch processes throughgloves etc., and to the experiencer everything can seem incredibly ‘real’ eventhough it is only computer-generated information tricking the senses intodecoding an illusion (Figs 28 and 29). This is what the five senses are doing asa matter of course, anyway (Fig 30). Virtual reality technology is creating avirtual reality within the virtual reality that we call human life and, as we goeven deeper into the rabbit hole, we will find that even what we call human lifeas currently experienced is a virtual reality within yet another virtualreality.[../Images/00271.jpg]Figure 28: Computer simulations hack into the five-sense decoding system andfeed them a fake reality.[../Images/00175.jpg]Figure 29: This can seem just as real as the ‘real’ world.[../Images/00134.jpg]Figure 30: Some hospitals use virtual-reality simulations to trick the mind intodecoding a reality that makes changing dressings less painful.Holographic reality: ‘Seeing’ what isn’t thereThe ‘world’ that we think is ‘physical’, but isn’t, and that we think is outsideof ourselves, but isn’t, is holographic – illusory ‘physical’. Most people willhave seen the holograms that you can buy in shops. They are notthree-dimensional, but they appear to be. They are created by a laser beamdivided into two beams (Fig 31). One part of the laser (reference beam) goesdirectly onto a photographic print while the other (working beam) photographsthe object in waveform. The working beam is then also directed at thephotographic print where it collides with the reference beam to create what isknown in holographics as an interference pattern (Fig 32). This is the sameprinciple as two stones being dropped in a pond. As the waves from the impactsexpand, they collide and create a waveform version of where the stones fell, thespeed of impact and so on (Fig 33). Here we have that word again, both in termsof the stones in the water and the holographic print – waveform. The foundationof holograms, from which the apparently three-dimensional objects are projected,is waveform information. The process of transforming waveform information intoan illusory ‘physical’ hologram is completed when a laser is directed at thewaveform information construct and the hologram is projected into being (Fig34). The best of them can look as ‘solid’ as you and me and the world that wethink we are living ‘in’, and yet you can put your hand through them. Theirphysicality is illusory and so is our reality. Holograms are being used evermore widely today not only as still images, but as moving pictures. There havebeen some incredible presentations in which the holographic image of along-passed singer performs a duet with someone from today. A holographic ElvisPresley singing with Celine Dion is a memorable example (Fig 35, 36 and 37). Wedecode the waveform information construct of the universe into holographicreality in much the same way in theme, if not detail, as conventionalholographics. The waveform passes through the five senses to become electrical(same information, different expression) and then digital (ditto) andholographic (ditto), but none of this exists outside of ourselves – however muchit appears that way. The whole deal is going on inside us, within the decodingprocess of brain, DNA and genetic structure in general (Fig 38). In fact, it ismy view that the major point of entry for the waveform information into theBody-Mind computer is through DNA, which is a receiver-transmitter systemcontrolled and regulated by the lesser-known RNA which I will come to later.Even the five senses themselves are illusory in the way that we appear toexperience them. I have been saying for all these years that the rabbit hole isincredibly deep and it is getting deeper all the time as my mind opens wider toConsciousness. But the deeper I go the simpler it all gets and not more complexas you would imagine the case to be. It really is all an illusion and what wecall atoms and even waveform states only manifest as such when they are beingobserved. They are created by the act of observing – decoding information orthought fields. When they are not being observed (decoded) they exist only aspure potential. I will explain this in more detail later but given this centralrole of the observer in creating reality you can see why the target of theControl System in all its forms is the human mind and perception of reality. Ifyou can program a person’s perception of reality they will observe/decode thatperception into manifested and experienced reality. It’s all a mind game – thebattle to dominate perception and, though this, dictate the nature of thedecoded and experienced ‘world’. The realisation that the body is a hologram,like everything else in this reality, opens the door to explanations about somany mysteries that baffle mainstream ‘science’ – including phenomena that aredismissed and refuted by the ‘scientific’ establishment on the simple premisethat if they can’t explain them they can’t exist. The arrogance of this beggarsbelief. For example, one of the amazing characteristics of holograms is thatevery part of a hologram is a smaller version of the whole. Put another way, ifyou cut a holographic waveform print into four pieces and point the laser ateach one you will not see four quarter-segments of the holographic image. Youwill see four quarter-sized versions of the whole hologram (Fig 39). Clarity maybe lost as the hologram is reduced in this way, but it still represents theinformation in the whole hologram – every part of a hologram is a smallerversion of the whole. The body is a hologram and so every part of the body is asmaller version of the whole. This explains why reflexology, acupuncture andother forms of alternative healing can find areas in different parts of the body– hand, ear, foot, whatever – that affect different organs and processes of thewhole body (Figs 40 and 41). It has to be like this because the body is ahologram. Even the great majority of practitioners of these healing methods inmy experience do not understand that they are possible because the body is ahologram. Palm reading comes from the same principle because the hand containsinformation about the whole body on multiple levels of being. Experiments overthe years have shown that some people can ‘see’ through other parts of theirbodies, including the palm of the hand, and not only through the eyes. They cando this by employing the sight senses located throughout the body-hologram, inthis case the hand. They don’t see as clearly as with the part of the hologramspecialising in sight – i.e. the eyes – but they are employing the same basicprocess of decoding information and communicating it electrically to thevision-decoding area of the brain. There is a mathematical phenomenon known as‘fractals’, which are detailed repeating patterns that can look the same onevery level. They can be found in nature and throughout the universe (Fig 42).Fractals are, I suggest, a digital expression of holographic reality whereeverything is a smaller version of the whole. Mainstream scientists likeProfessor Richard Dawkins at Oxford University (‘Dogma Dawkins’ as I call him)write books and make documentaries condemning and dismissing alternative methodsof healing and explanations of the world because, although they are feted byacademia and the mainstream media, they are bloody clueless about the truenature of reality, the human body and how it all comes together. Theirfoundation perceptions about reality are based on bollocks and so they must,from this prime distortion, express this ignorance holographically (ironically)by constantly talking bollocks. ‘As above, so below’, as New Agers love to say,but mostly without realising the true meaning. What is the term ‘as above, sobelow’, actually referring to? Holographic reality. The sad thing is thatacademics like Dawkins sell their nonsense to the students of each generation,most of whom believe it, and so the nonsense is downloaded from generation togeneration ad infinitum until the cycle is broken. This can only happen whenConsciousness gets a look in. One other point worth making is that a holographicuniverse means that the human body must be a smaller version of the universe andthat there must be constant interaction between the two (Fig 43). Look at thesimilarity between the human and planetary energy fields and electrical activityin the brain and the universe (Figs 44 and 45). I don’t suppose a ‘scientist’ ordoctor has ever told you that – mostly because they don’t know. They only knowwhat they are told to know and funded to know and research. We are the universeand the universe is us. We are everything and everything is us.[../Images/00083.jpg]Figure 31: How a laser divided into two beams creates the holographic illusion.[../Images/00042.jpg]Figure 32: The waveform interference pattern of a holographic image.[../Images/00181.jpg]Figure 33: Waveform water.[../Images/00452.jpg]Figure 34: Holograms can look as solid as you and me, but they are illusionsthat have no solidity.Pictures: ‘Strawberry’ Mirage - 3D Hologram Generator,http://www.eyetricks.com/mirage [http://www.eyetricks.com/mirage] • ‘Rose’courtesy of Holography Studio, All-Russian Exhibition Center, Moscow, seewww.holography.ru [http://www.holography.ru] • Picture ‘Saturn’ courtesy ofRoyal Holographic Art Gallery, see www.holograms.bc.ca[http://www.holograms.bc.ca][../Images/00375.jpg]Figure 35: Hologram Elvis sings ‘live’ with Celine Dion.[../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 36: A hologram can look so ‘real’.[../Images/00439.jpg]Figure 37: The man on the left is ‘real’ but the other is a hologram projectedfrom another city.[../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 38: The ‘real’ world is a decoded illusion.[../Images/00335.jpg]Figure 39: Every part of a hologram is a smaller version of the whole.> [../Images/00475.jpg]> Figures 40 and 41: The whole body can be healed from a part of the body> because one is a smaller version of the other.[../Images/00405.jpg]Figure 42: Repeating-pattern fractals have holographic traits.[../Images/00543.jpg]Figure 43: The body is a smaller version of the entire reality.[../Images/00509.jpg][../Images/00545.jpg]Figure 44: A above, so below.

I was passing through London’sHeathrow Airport in 2009, many years after I began writing and talking about theholographic nature of the universe, when I saw a mainstream ‘science’ magazinecalled New Scientist with the front cover headline: ‘You are a hologram ...projected from the edge of the universe’ (Fig 46). The article inside featuredan American scientist postulating that the universe is holographic and it wassuch a pleasure to see that the walls of suppression and dogma are beginning tocrack. The article didn’t take us any further forward beyond the basic premise,to be honest, but it was still a positive sign. Holographic reality is notprojected from the edge of the universe; it is manifested through the decodingprocesses of the human Body-Mind computer as it reads information from thewaveform construct. The pioneering work in the field by scientists like quantumphysicist, David Bohm (1917-1992) and Karl Pribram, Professor Emeritus ofPsychology and Psychiatry at Stanford University and Radford University in theUnited States, has been far more insightful than what I read in the magazine,but clearly others are starting to pick up this theme as the ‘scientific’ songsheet is reassessed and found to be what is has always been – bullshit.[../Images/00172.jpg]Figure 46: Even some mainstream scientists are now seeing the obvious."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00404.jpg]You Are All That IsPrinciples for the Development of a Complete Mind: Study the science of art.Study the art of science. Develop your senses – especially learn how to see.Realize that everything connects to everything else. Leonardo da VinciLet us explore some of these ‘mysteries’ that mainstream ‘science’ finds sobewildering and will continue to do so while it stagnates and slumbers in itscul-de-sac of dogma and rigidity. Funny, when you come from the perspective thatI am detailing here they no longer appear to be mysterious at all, let alonebewildering.I have mentioned one, already; how can atoms that aren’t solid be the buildingblocks of a solid world? Well, clearly they can’t be and they don’t have to bebecause the world isn’t solid. They are simply part of the process in whichwaveform information is decoded into electrical, digital and holographic states.Another apparent mystery: why have scientists discovered that something can takea waveform and a particle form at the same time? Well, look at holograms and thequestion answers itself. The apparently three-dimensional holographic projectionof an object is just that – a projection. It only exists because the laser isreading waveform information encoded in the interference pattern on thephotographic film or plate. Take away the waveform information and you deletethe hologram that is being projected from it. In other words, not only do thehologram and the waveform exist at the same time – they must do or there can beno hologram, no ‘particle’, and no projection. The hologram and the waveforminformation from which the hologram is projected are different expressions ofthe same information. They are each other – and so it is with the waveform andthe particle. They are two states of the same information field. How can twoparticles communicate with each other instantly over billions of miles, a factthat has also flummoxed mainstream ‘science’? There are no ‘particles’ as weperceive them, nor any billions of miles, because there is no ‘space’. Time andspace are illusions of the decoding process as I will explain later. Another‘mystery’: What are near-death experiences and out-of-body experiences whenpeople claim to have been exposed to a vastly different reality outside of thebody? They are Awareness withdrawing from the vehicle and so from thelimitations and sense of reality of the vehicle. ‘Death’ or ‘near-death’ is onlyour point of attention being transferred from the ‘lens’ of the body, whichfocusses attention on the tiny frequency band called visible light, to anawareness of the greater reality (Fig 47). This is why near-death experiencerswho have ‘died’ and returned to tell the tale speak of experiencing a massivelyexpanded sense of reality in which ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ all cometogether as one infinite NOW and multi-realities can be experienced at the same‘time’. This is because the Body-Mind computer is no longer limiting – focusing– the sense of reality and attention as it was before. The sense of no time orspace is simply the fact that beyond our current reality there is no ‘time’ or‘space’. These are only a few of the ‘mysteries’ that dissolve once people opentheir minds to reality as it really is and stop believing what Stone Age‘science’ tells them it is. Many more ‘mysteries’ will fall as we go along, too.[../Images/00094.jpg]Figure 47: Near-death experiencers describe an enormous expansion of awarenessbecause their point of attention has been freed from the lens – the focus –ofthe body which can only decode a minute band of frequency.Reality is a state of AwarenessFoundation fact: everything is conscious no matter what it is because everythingis an expression of Infinite Awareness. This is the bottom line from which allother understanding comes. The point is, though, that not everything is at thesame level of awareness. George Bush – I rest my case. It depends on the scaleand depth of your point of attention. Is it focussed pretty much only on thefive senses? Well, then, the level of awareness will be severely limited. Doesit stretch from the five senses into expanded levels of awareness that includethe understanding that we are all one Infinite Consciousness having infiniteexperiences through infinite points of attention? In that case your span ofawareness will be far greater and most people in this reality will probably callyou crazy. Congratulations if they do. So everything is an expression ofInfinite Awareness, but not everything is infinitely aware. Most are not, atleast in this reality, anyway, and hence the tidal wave of insane nonsense thatwe daily face. The example of water is a classic confirmation that all isconscious. Yet again, mainstream ‘science’ has dismissed and ridiculed thesuggestion, even from among some of its own, that water has a memory and canretain information. But the Dogma Dawkins mentality is now being made to lookreal silly by the emerging evidence that this is so. The Aerospace Institute inStuttgart, Germany, has developed a technique for photographing information inwater and from this has come the confirmation that water does retain informationand about the holographic structure of the universe. Researchers placed a flowerin a tank of water and when it was removed they observed droplets from the waterusing the techniques the Institute has developed. They found that all thedroplets contained the image of the flower (put ‘water has a memory’ intoYouTube to see a video). Another experiment gathered together volunteers fromthe local community and asked each of them to take four droplets from the samecontainer of water and place them in a dish with their name on. They found ineach case that the batches of four droplets were all different, but the fourdroplets in each batch were the same (Fig 48). In the simple act of transferringa droplet from the tank to the dish the water had retained the uniqueinformation field of the person involved. Now imagine the information – memory –that is contained in the ocean, lakes and rivers, and think also of how thatinformation is distorted by the rogue information that we call pollution fromsources like the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and the nuclear catastropheat Fukushima, neither of which, I suggest, were accidents; but more aboutFukushima later. The human body is some 60 to 70 percent water and 90 percent ofthe body’s molecules are water molecules. The same principle applies with bodywater as any other kind. What does the rogue information that we ingest, drinkand breathe in from pollution and chemicals in food and drink additives and theatmosphere do to the information field of the Body-Mind computer? The answer isobvious.[../Images/00066.jpg]Figure 48: Four different people and yet all the droplets look the same in eachcase. The water had recorded each individual energy field in the seconds it tookto put a droplet from a tank into a dish.The Dogma Dawkins mentality and its intellectual (it says here) arrogance wavesaway with contempt the healing system known as homeopathy. They say it must benonsense given that the substances in homeopathic preparations are diluted anddiluted so much that in the end none remains. To the ‘world is solid’ brigadethis is all an away-day in Fairy Land and worthy only of derision. But, intruth, they are themselves located with the Fairy Queen. When a British healthminister indicated support for homeopathy the media poodles of thepharmaceutical cartel immediately questioned his suitability for the job onthose grounds and compared homeopaths to snake-oil salesman. There were manyreasons why the bloke should not have had the job, but a belief in homeopathywas not one of them. The New Scientist magazine labeled him ‘the new ministerfor magic’. Their sheer ignorance of reality means that they can’t see thatwhile the substance (holographic expression of waveform information) is dilutedto nothing, the waveform information itself is retained and this is what doesthe healing on the waveform level of the body. There are many alternativehealing methods today that do the same and come under the heading of‘vibrational medicine’. Remember how the flower was taken from the water tank atthe German Aerospace Institute, but each droplet still contained the informationfield of the flower. The principle of homeopathy is exactly the same, but evenmost homeopaths don’t seem to realise that. I have heard so many say that theydon’t know how it works, but it just does. Homoeopathy today is way back fromthe cutting edge as new understandings bring us far more effective methods ofhealing, but the principle on which it is based gives still more support to thetrue nature of reality. Human memory is stored in the body’s biological water,throughout the genetic structure and in the energy fields that we call the humanaura. This must be so given that the body is a hologram. Mainstream ‘science’searches for the source of memory when there is no single source in aholographic form interpenetrated by the auric field that I call Mind. Ifexpressions of the heart and liver can be found in the foot and ear due to theholographic principle then the same must be the case with memory.[../Images/00106.jpg]Figure 49: Thought = experienced reality.> [../Images/00503.jpg]> Figure 50: What a mobile phone does to water crystals.Another man who has revealed amazing information from the study of water isJapanese researcher, Dr Masaru Emoto, who developed and expanded on earlierresearch. He has produced a series of books showing how human thought andemotion (energetic information) changes the structure of water and, bydefinition, reality itself. If water is changed by information then in aholographic universe so will be everything else. I spent a weekend in Londonexchanging information with Dr Emoto and later visited his research centre inTokyo. We produced a book together in Japanese at one point because my work andhis research with water so complement each other. Dr Emoto attaches words,phrases and technology (a cell phone for example) to canisters of water whichare then frozen very quickly and the water crystals photographed. The differencein the structure of the crystals in response to different words and phrases isextraordinary. Well, extraordinary if you are coming from the Dogma Dawkinsschool of thought. Once you understand the basic principles of our reality it isall so simple and explainable. You can see the dramatic difference between watercrystals from a canister of water exposed to words of love and appreciationcompared with one that says ‘You make me sick, I want to kill you’ (Fig 49).When you see what a cell phone does to water crystals you might think it a goodidea to get rid of yours if you have one, or to seriously reduce the time youhave it to your ear and brain (Fig 50). Look at the effect on water crystals ofheavy metal music and polluted water from a Japanese river (Fig 51).> [../Images/00003.jpg]> Figure 51: The effect on water crystals of heavy metal music and polluted> water.[../Images/00262.jpg]Figure 52: Posting and downloading – the interaction between the waveform andholographic realms..Once again, imagine what water crystals would be like if taken from the oil andchemical pollution in the Gulf of Mexico (and much wider afield by now as theinformation distortion circulates) and also the water impacted by Fukushima.Closer to home, what would water crystals look like if taken from the biologicalwater of the human body polluted by all the toxins that people eat, drink andbreathe? These things are not happening through random coincidence, either, asthis book will expose. They are being done systematically to a specific end ofhuman control and planetary decay. There is no mystery to how words andtechnology can fundamentally change the structure of water crystals. We comeback, as we will many times, to the whole foundation of the universe – thewaveform information construct or unified field ... the ‘Cosmic Internet’. Whenyou look at a water crystal you are looking at a hologram and the same when yousee technology, chemicals, pollution, or the written word. These are all decodedholographic expressions of waveform states. We may see and read words of loveand appreciation or ‘You make me sick, I want to kill you’ on a water container,but in their base state those words are waveform, or vibrational, in naturebecause everything is in this reality. Our ‘eyes’ (brain) only see (decode) theholographic projection. The water in the containers in its prime state is alsowaveform information. The resonating waveform level of the words and technologychange the waveform state of the water and when we decode this through to theholographic (illusory ‘physical’) it appears that different words and technology(waveform states) have changed the structure of the water crystals (waveformstates). We are affecting reality in the same way with every thought (waveformstate), emotion (waveform state), written and spoken word (waveform states) andso on, as we ‘post’ that information onto the Cosmic Internet (waveformconstruct). We are then, in turn, affected by the waveform state of thatenergetic construct because we are constantly interacting with it (Fig 52). Thisfield is currently awash with waveform-distorting bollocks because of thewaveform-distorting bollocks that humanity and its Control System are posting24/7.[../Images/00168.jpg]Figure 53: In the ayahuasca state I consciously merged with the All That Is.Still, Silent, All KnowingI have only taken psychoactive drugs twice in my life and that involved twonights in the Brazilian rainforest in 2003 when I took the rainforest plantpotion called ayahuasca. There was, to be strictly accurate, one other occasionwhen I took ‘magic mushrooms’, but they were so weak it hardly counts. I drankthe ayahuasca from a small glass and it tasted a bit like liquorice. The firstnight I took it alone and the next night I was with a group of people all lyingon mattresses in a circular wooden building in the forest. It took around anhour on both nights for me to slip into altered states of awareness way beyondthe holographic realm and even the electromagnetic spectrum, never mind justvisible light. The ‘human individual’ merges with its true self – All That Is(Fig 53). Ayahuasca contains Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a powerfulneuron-transmitter and psychedelic drug that occurs naturally in many plants.DMT stimulates the activity of the pineal gland in the centre of the brain whichoperates as what is called the ‘third-eye’ – the connection with otherexpressions of reality beyond the ‘world’ that we normally perceive. The pinealgland is only the size of a grain of rice but it is vital to body function aswell as our ability to ‘see’ beyond what we think we see. How ‘coincidental’then that the fluoride added to drinking water and toothpaste calcifies thepineal gland. This is part of the agenda to block humanity’s other-dimensionalsenses to maintain us in five-sense ignorance and so control us. I will explainthis throughout the book. The laws against psychoactive drugs all over the worldare also an aspect of this dumbing down of human awareness. The effect of whatis now called DMT has been known since ancient times and you can see depictionsof psychoactive plants and the pineal gland in the remains and artefacts ofancient cultures throughout the world. The pineal gland is often symbolised as apine cone, which it resembles, and you will find a massive one on display at theVatican (Fig 54). A voice began to speak to me loudly and clearly on the secondnight that I took ayahuasca and continued to do so for the next five hours. Theinformation the voice communicated was astonishing. It took a female form (thatis way I decoded it anyway) and gave me chapter and verse about the illusorynature of ‘physical’ reality. I returned to England with total recall of allthat was said (amazing in itself) and I began to check the facts againstmainstream ‘scientific’ discovery. I saw that even song sheet ‘science’ acrossthe various disciplines had established that ‘solid’ reality is illusory –especially in the field of quantum physics, of course – but most of thisinformation has not been connected together so the elephant in the livingquarters (reality is an illusion) can be widely acknowledged as blatantlyobvious. Once I understood (remembered, in truth) the themes about illusory‘physical’ reality, the pennies dropped like a Las Vegas jackpot with regard towhy human life is as it is and how the Control System functions and manipulatesfrom way beyond the world that we think we see. The voice explained with greathumour (I laughed so much that night it was painful) how the ‘physical’ is anillusory world of decoded information and how the belief that it is ‘real’entraps human minds in a lifetime of servitude more than anything else. Phrasesabounded like: ‘Do you think that’s earth you’re lying on now? Illuuuusion!’ Thevoice began by saying that I was going to be taken to where I came from and towhere I would return. With that, I found myself experiencing a realm of absolutelove, peace and bliss in which everything was One. There was no division, nocompetition, no conflict, no fears or worries. What’s more, it was silent, apartfrom the intermittent female ‘voiceover’, and there was stillness, except forthe odd movement in extreme slow motion. ‘This is the Infinite, David’, thevoice said. I was then told that all we really needed to know is that ‘InfiniteLove is the only truth – everything else is illusion’. This was repeated manytimes: ‘Infinite Love is the only truth, everything else is illusion.’[../Images/00412.jpg]Figure 54: The pine cone ‘pineal gland’ at the Vatican.This ‘love’ is not the ‘love’ that most humans think they understand. That iswhat I call ‘mind-love’ – a ‘physical’/chemical attraction. People who have beeninvolved in government mind control programmes have told me how easy it is toget people to fall madly in love with each other merely by triggering certainchemicals in the brain. Significant numbers of people become addicted to thesechemicals and they jump from partner to partner for a new ‘fix’ when thechemicals are no longer produced by the previous relationship. The title of the1986 song, Addicted to Love, by Robert Palmer captures the theme. But this isnot ‘love’ in its true sense. It is a mostly temporary attraction which can, andtoo often does, turn to hatred and loathing when the chemicals fade. We havebecome so disconnected from the true meaning of love, as in Infinite Love, thatwe have to use terms like unconditional love to express what we mean. How manypartner ‘mind-love’ relationships are unconditional – I love you whatever?Friendship is far closer to Infinite Love than most partnerships, because a truefriend is there for you whatever happens. They may not always like or agree withwhat you do, but they are always there when you need them. My deep friendshipwith Linda, who was my wife for 29 years, is like that and it is far better thananything that ‘I pronounce you man and wife’ could produce. I have hadrelationships with people who turned out not to be my friends and far from beingthere when I needed them they set out to exploit me in any way they could whiletelling everyone how loving they were. Beware of people who feel the need to sayhow ‘loving’ they are because if they were it would be obvious, no wordsnecessary. Those that keep telling you how angelic they are usually turn out tothe last ones to express that in practice. This is my experience, anyway. Irealised that the Infinite Love, bliss, peace, silence and stillness that Iexperienced that night in Brazil was the core of all existence. It is what somecall the All That Is, Has Been And Ever Can Be. This will sound like animpossibility to most people. How could anything be All That Is, Has Been AndEver Can Be? I’ll tell you: by being ... All Possibility. The heart of allexistence, which pervades all else, is the still and silent realm of AllPossibility, or what others call the Void. But here’s a question that willfollow from this: How can something that is still and silent be All Possibility?It is a relevant point given the way that humanity is conditioned and programmedto perceive reality. Human perception overwhelmingly believes that for somethingto ‘exist’ it must take form or make a noise. I can’t see it or hear it so itcan’t exist. Silence? That means nothing, doesn’t it? Stillness? Ditto. But asusual with human perception the opposite is the case. Within the stillness andsilence is All Possibility, All Potential, waiting to be made manifest. Hear thesilence and you are hearing All Possibility. Then start talking, taking anaction or making a noise and you have pulled one possibility out of AllPossibility. When you stop, your manifested possibility returns to the stillnessand silence of All Possibility – Infinite Love, Infinite Harmony, InfiniteBalance, Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Everything. This core of existence thatI call All Possibility is within all of us – it is us and we are it (Figs 55, 56and 57). But most humans have lost touch with this level of Infinite Self and inthat state its influence on our perception and potential is largely dormant, atleast consciously. This leaves the myopia of the five senses and lower mind todominate our sense of reality. People speak of experiencing stillness andsilence in states of deep meditation and having great insight. This is becausethey are connecting with a realm where everything is One – the Infinite Ocean ofConsciousness that I am describing. If they go deep enough they tap into thestillness and silence of All Possibility and All Knowingness. My great friend,the Zulu high shaman Credo Mutwa, calls this ‘the silent cave where past,present and future become one’. There are no paradoxes within All Possibility,only Infinite Potential. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere,it is and it isn’t. ‘That can’t be’, people cry. It must be one or the other.This is the human Body-Mind speaking which is programmed to see only oppositesand polarity. All Possibly has to be everything and nothing, everywhere andnowhere, to be and not be, or it wouldn’t be All Possibility. The humanBody-Mind is so disconnected from prime reality that it can see only parts andnot the Infinite Whole. Those considered by hindsight to be centuries ahead oftheir ‘time’, like Leonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519), the Renaissance architect,musician, inventor, engineer, sculptor and painter, and Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), the philosopher and astronomer, could access the ‘slient cave’ and gaininsight that others could not. This meant that their true genius was neverrecognised in their lifetimes and Bruno was burned at the stake for heresy(seeing what others could not see).> [../Images/00281.jpg]> Figure 55, 56 and 57: The still and silent All That Is – All Possibility, All> That Can Be.The worlds of apparent form are manifested from the stillness and silence of AllPossibility as information is encoded into energetic waveform or vibrationalstates – states of thought or Consciousness (Fig 58). These worlds are createdwith Consciousness by Consciousness (Infinite Imagination) and this is whyeverything is Conscious. There is nothing else except Consciousness in itsinfinite manifestations. The voice in Brazil said: ‘If it vibrates, it’sillusion’. Put another way, if it vibrates it is an illusory world of manifestedform, not the prime state, the ‘only truth’, the only eternal constant – still,silent, Infinite Love, Infinite Possibility. As I said earlier, the onlycertainty is eternity. Worlds of form constantly change and come and go, but AllPossibility is forever All Possibility. The realms of waveform or vibrationresonate to different frequencies and so they can share the same ‘space’ andinterpenetrate each other like radio and television stations of the analoguesystem. These stations and channels can exist together without affecting eachother because they are on different wavelengths or bands of wavelength.Interference only happens with stations very close to each other on thebroadcast spectrum and, in the same way, different ‘worlds’ (frequency bands)are coexisting in the same ‘space’ while humanity is oblivious of them, as theyare of each other, unless Consciousness is expanded to connect with them (Fig59). This is what genuine psychics and mediums are doing (so many are notgenuine or gifted, but persuade people they are, including themselves). Two ofthe most genuinely gifted ones in my own experience are Carol Clarke in the UKand Monnica Sepulveda in California. Awareness/entities in other frequencybands, or what many call dimensions, communicate through psychics, mediums or‘channels’ by projecting thought fields to them via (in our reality)electromagnetic energetic connection. This was the ‘spider’s web’ that I felt onmy face during my initial experience with Betty Shine. The psychic decodes theseinformation fields into words in his or her own language. An English psychicdecodes the information field into English, a Spanish one into Spanish. Thecommunications between realities are not delivered in human words, but asthought fields and concept fields which are then translated by thepsychic/medium. The quality of the translation is vital or complete crap can‘come though’ just as with a bad translation from one language to another –‘this French lady with not very good English says that in 1789 pheasants warmedthe Pastile’. Go on, you can work it out. It is not only the quality of thetranslations, but what level of awareness the psychic/medium is connecting with.The information can be anything from extremely profound from ‘way out there’ toa request to ‘look after the cat’ by a recently departed awareness on afrequency band extremely close to this one. Or it could all be total tosh, asmuch of it is in the New Age and non-New Age psychic arenas, or purposelydesigned by the communicator to mislead. I saw someone ‘channel’ an ‘Irishpriest’ once using the most classic and extreme Irish accent – ‘Oh, begosh andbeggorah’ – that you only normally hear when people are taking the piss. I wassupposed to take this seriously as the rest of the assembled were doing, but Ithought instead that it was me, not the ‘priest’ who had died and enteredanother dimension. There are many mansions in my father’s house, apparently, andsome of them are lunatic asylums.[../Images/00041.jpg]Figure 58: The realms of manifest form are created from the Infinite Possibilityof the All That Is.[../Images/00312.jpg]Figure 59: When we open our mind to the greater Consciousness we can connectwith the expanded awareness of other realities and cease to be aware of onlythis one.Warlocks and Bol-locksThe phenomenon that many call ghosts and ghostly happenings can be explainedfrom this perspective. Some are disincarnate awareness on frequencies closeenough to this one to be seen ethereally, if not ‘solidly’, and other‘paranormal’ phenomena can be simply experiences, especially very emotional oneslike murders, battles and other tragedies, which are imprinted as information inthe waveform/vibrational fabric of a location. You can feel this in theatmosphere (energy field) when you go to an ancient place, battlefield,cemetery, stately home or anywhere that has experienced plenty of unpleasanthappenings or is still entity-haunted. You might feel a sensation or chill inthe back or the neck (the central nervous system picking up the ‘vibes’) and say‘I don’t like it here – I want to leave’. What people experience in these casesof energetic imprinting (an energetic ‘recording’) are not ghostly entities, butlike a waveform movie in the energy field that keeps playing for thosepsychically sensitive enough to tune into it. Those not so sensitive see or hearnothing and they will often dub those that do crazy or strange. ‘What do youmean you can hear a child crying in an empty room? I can’t hear a thing. Youneed help, mate.’ The imprinted movie is actually ‘played’ by people decodingthe energy field because the information is always there until it is deleted,which can be done if you know what you are doing. Different dimensions orfrequency bands of reality also explain why people report seeing entities andUFOs appearing and disappearing – much to the derision of the professionalsceptics (ignorant and programmed Body-Minds). What happens is that the entitiesand craft pass through into our frequency band and suddenly, to the observer,they appear ‘out of nowhere’. But they haven’t. They have entered the frequencyband – visible light – that we can decode and so they give the illusion ofmanifesting out of nothing. It is the same in the reverse direction when peoplesay that entities or craft disappeared in a flash (they withdraw from the humanfrequency range and can no longer be decoded into holographic form and so, tothe observer, they instantly disappear). When you press the TV zapper button tochange channels, what happens? The previous channel disappears when another onecomes on the screen. So what we call ‘the world’ is only a tiny band offrequency within other bands of frequency, or ‘dimensions’. There is more to itthan that, but it will do for now.Some scientists have suggested over the years that perhaps ‘physical’ realityrequires an observer for it to manifest. I say that absolutely it does, althoughI prefer to use the term ‘decoder’ rather than observer. Only when the waveformconstruct is being decoded can it manifest as holographic reality. When it isnot being decoded it remains only in its waveform state. The waveforminformation pattern on a holographic photographic film cannot manifest theinformation as a hologram until it is triggered by a laser. The principle is thesame. I have told the story in other books which the late Michael Talbotrecalled in his excellent book, The Holographic Universe, in which he exploredthe scientific and experiential evidence that our conscious reality isholographic. He said that his father had hosted a party to which he invited astage hypnotist to entertain the guests. The hypnotist put a man called Tom intoa trance state and told him that when he ‘woke up’ he would not be able to seehis daughter in the room. He then asked the daughter to stand right in front ofthe sitting Tom so that he was looking right into her belly. Tom was returned toa wakened state and the hypnotist asked if he could see his daughter. ‘No’, hesaid, she was not there. In fact, she was standing right in front of him. Thehypnotist put his hand at the bottom of the daughter’s back and said that he washolding something in his hand. Could Tom tell him what it was? ‘It’s a watch’,said Tom, bemused at the question because it was so clear to him. ‘There is aninscription on the watch’, the hypnotist said. Could Tom read that? He peeredforward and read it accurately while his daughter was standing between him andthe watch. If the world was really solid and physical all this would beimpossible and the Dogma Dawkins mentality within mainstream science would nodoubt dismiss the story as fantasy. But Tom’s experience can be so easilyexplained when you know what reality really is. The daughter’s body, as witheverything in the universe, is a waveform information construct and unless it isdecoded through into a holographic state it cannot be seen by the conscious mindwithin the holographic realm of visible light. The hypnotist implanted afirewall into Tom’s decoding process by the hypnotic suggestion (program) thathis daughter was not in the room. This prevented him from ‘reading’ her energyfield into holographic form and so he couldn’t see her with his conscious mind.Only by decoding the waveform information from his daughter’s body-field couldhe bring her into the holographic reality of his conscious mind (Fig 60). Withher deleted from his holographic reality she was not a barrier to seeing thewatch because, in his experienced ‘world’, she wasn’t there. Everyone else inthe room could see the daughter because they hadn’t been hypnotically‘firewalled’ not to decode her.[../Images/00256.jpg]Figure 60: You can only ‘see’ anyone or anything when they are decoded from thewaveform to the holographic. Unless we do that they remain invisible to theconscious mind.This single story alone about Tom and his daughter is incredibly relevant to howhumanity is mass-controlled through the mass manipulation of perception. What isreal? Well, in terms of a ‘physical’ world nothing is real. It is all anillusion decoded by the lower senses and it is indeed all bollocks. Tounderstand the reality that we think we live ‘in’ we need to re-evaluate allperceptions and preconceptions down to the finest detail. You think that’s airyou’re breathing now?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00574.jpg]You Are What You Choose To BeYou will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself ... theheight of a man’s success is gauged by his self-mastery; the depth of hisfailure by his self-abandonment ... And this law is the expression of eternaljustice. He who cannot establish dominion over himself will have no dominionover others. Leonardo da VinciWe decode waveform information into electrical, digital and holographic statesand so the universe exists at all these levels and manifestations. They aredifferent expressions of the same information. There is now a gathering body ofpeople and researchers who are revealing the existence of the electrical/electromagnetic level under the heading of the ‘Electric Universe’.Two of the leading proponents are David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill, who haveproduced two first class books, The Electric Universe and Thunderbolts of theGods, which detail the overwhelming evidence that, on one level, the universe isalive with electricity and electromagnetic fields. It would be very easy toharness this technologically and turn it into useable and limitless power freeof charge once the technology was in place, but this is being suppressed for alist of reasons that will be highlighted, but most basic of all is that it wouldput the energy cartel out of business and release the global population fromhaving to serve the system to pay big energy bills. Remember, too, that thosewho are suppressing this technology and knowledge about the electrical nature ofthe universe are the same people saying that current sources of energy thatgenerate carbon dioxide should be dramatically reduced or banned to ‘save theplanet’. But they don’t want this badly enough to solve their illusoryhuman-caused ‘climate change’ problem (scam) by giving the worldnaturally-occurring free electrical energy. Everything generates electricalactivity and that includes plants and trees. University of Washingtonresearchers Babak Parviz and Brian Otis were reported in 2012 to have discoveredthat an electrical device can be powered by plugging it into a tree. Parvizsaid: ‘As far as we know this is the first peer-reviewed paper of someonepowering something entirely by sticking electrodes into a tree.’ Well,congratulations to them for that, but those who understand how reality workshave known that everything generates energetic power for a long, long time.Other research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has confirmedthat plants generate a voltage of up to 200 millivolts when one electrode isplaced in a plant and the other in the surrounding soil. Mainstream ‘science’acknowledges that electromagnetic fields exist ‘out there’, but denies that theuniverse is electrical when you can’t have electromagnetic fields withoutelectricity. Mmmm ... something not right there, I would wager. Mainstream‘science’ cannot replicate its version of the universe in a laboratory, butresearchers and advocates of the Electric Universe can do so (Fig 61). Lightningis the most obvious expression of electricity in the atmosphere and there is alot more going on electrically with a lightning flash than simply what we see inthe sky. Lightning is a discharge when too much electricity builds up in theatmosphere. This triggers electrical connections and responses at higheraltitudes known by scientists as ‘elves’, ‘sprites’, ‘gnomes’ and ‘jets’ as theelectrical impact of the lightning flash plays out into the cosmos (Fig 62).Tornadoes are created by fast-rotating electrical fields and this is why theyappear during electrical storms and an accumulation of electricity in theatmosphere. Mainstream ‘science’ tells us that ‘physical’ matter is heldtogether by gravity when this is actually the work of electromagnetism which, asTalbott and Thornhill point out, is about ‘a thousand trillion, trillion,trillion times’ more powerful than gravity. It is electricity andelectromagnetism that maintain the planets in their orbits around the Sun andanything that distorts and destabilises those electromagnetic forces will causethe planets to go walkabout. This has happened in our solar system in relativelyrecent times as recorded by all ancient cultures. Electrical forces in theuniverse interact with plasma, ‘the fourth state of matter’. Most people willhave seen those plasma balls that react with electrical charges when you placeyour hand on them (Fig 63). Plasma is an almost perfect medium for electricityand electromagnetic fields and very significantly 99.999 percent of theobservable universe consists of plasma. The name was coined by American NobelLaureate, Irving Langmuir (1881-1957), when he observed that electrical forcesare carried in cosmic plasma in much the same way that red and white bloodcorpuscles are carried in blood plasma. Langmuir also noted plasma’s life-likeability to self-organise in response to electrical change. This is possiblebecause, like everything, plasma is conscious.> [../Images/00355.jpg]> Figure 61: The Electric Universe – in the heavens and in the laboratory.[../Images/00124.jpg]Figure 62: There is far more to a lightning strike than people realise.[../Images/00462.jpg]Figure 63: The classic plasma ball.The Norwegian scientist, Kristian Olaf Birkeland (1867-1917), discovered thatfilaments are created when electricity passes through the plasma. These havebecome known, for obvious reasons, as ‘Birkeland currents’. The universe is amass or tapestry of these filaments of vastly different sizes, from tiny tolight years across. A remarkable ‘natural’ phenomenon takes place as thesecurrents pass through the plasma. The electricity generates electromagneticfields which cause the filaments to rotate around each other while theelectromagnetism also keeps them apart. This is known as the ‘plasma pinch’ andyou can see this same theme in the Double Helix Nebula and, most significantly,in DNA (Fig 64). Here we have another example of ‘as above, so below’ – thehologram – and this is why the electrical universe and electrical brain activityare mirrors of each other (Fig 65). Our electrical connection with reality comesthrough the heart, electrical brain activity, the central nervous system,electrical components of the entire genetic structure and the electromagneticauric field (Fig 66). Even NASA had to admit in 2007 that electromagnetic fieldswere the cause of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights: ‘New data from NASA’sThemis mission ... found that the energy comes from charged particles from theSun following like a current through twisted bundles of electromagnetic fieldsconnecting Earth’s upper atmosphere to the Sun.’ Planets and stars also have‘auric fields’ (the hologram again) and these are known as magnetospheres. Aremarkable characteristic of plasma makes these possible. Scientist IrvingLangmuir discovered that when plasma of a certain electrical charge meets plasmaof a different electrical charge an energetic barrier is automatically createdbetween the two. These barriers are now called ‘Langmuir Sheaths’ and theydefine the planetary energy fields or magnetospheres (Fig 67).[../Images/00294.jpg]Figure 64: The ‘plasma pinch’, the Double Helix Nebula and DNA.[../Images/00282.jpg]Figure 65: That image again ... the electric brain interacts with the electricunivserse.[../Images/00306.jpg]Figure 66: Electric human and electric reality.[../Images/00329.jpg]Figure 67: ‘Langmuir sheaths’ define the magnetospheres.The ‘light bulb’ SunThe Sun has its own version known as the ‘heliosphere’ and this must be the casewith the Sun consisting almost entirely (99 percent) of plasma. It is a plasmaball processing electricity. Mainstream science has got the Sun so wrong it’shard to know where to start. The Sun is not a gigantic nuclear reactorgenerating heat and light from its core (and so it is not burning itself out andheading for ultimate destruction). Ralph Juergens, an American engineer andelectric universe researcher, said: ‘The modern astrophysical concept thatascribes the Sun’s energy to thermonuclear reactions deep in the solar interioris contradicted by nearly every observable aspect of the Sun.’ But theobservably obvious has never stopped mainstream science promoting the absurdlynonsensical in the past and nor does it now. The energetic power of the Sun doesnot come from within itself. The power is generated at the electrical level ofthe universe and the Sun is an electrical processor and transformer which drawsits power from the universal electrical field and turns it into light – the sameprinciple as a light bulb, really. The electrical field goes through cycles whenthere is more electrical power available than at other times and this isreflected in the so-called ‘sun-cycle’ when solar activity increases anddiminishes. Think of how a dimmer switch works. The x-ray level of the Sun dimsin the same way in response to reduced electrical power. One of the majormeasurements of solar activity is sunspots – the massive holes punched in theSun’s surface by electrical activity (Fig 68). Mainstream ‘science’ claims thatthis happens because of increased energy generated from inside the Sun, but infact the opposite is the case. The hole-punching power is coming the other way.There is a ‘plasma doughnut’, known as a ‘torus’, which can be seen at theultraviolet level circling the solar equator and this torus absorbs and storeselectricity from the universal ‘grid’ (Fig 69). When there is a high-power cycleof electrical activity the torus becomes overloaded and has to dischargeelectricity in the same way that the Earth’s atmosphere does with lightning.These discharges smack into the solar surface punching the holes that we callsunspots and so the number of sunspots is rightly used to measure the level ofsolar activity; but sunspots are created from without, not from within. Moreconfirmation of the wrong-way-round perception of the Sun by mainstream‘science’ comes from the fact that the surface of the Sun is relatively coolcompared with the incredible temperatures in the upper atmosphere. The Sun’scorona, which is way out from the surface, is the hottest part of the Sun – some200 million degrees Kelvin compared with 5,000 degrees at the surface. Talkabout as clear as the nose on your face. When scientists embarked on a ‘MRI’(magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the Sun’s inner workings they found thevery opposite to what should have been there if their theories about the Sun’sheating system were accurate. The official story goes that the Sun’s power comesfrom a thermo-nuclear reaction at the centre which is brought to the surface bya radiative zone and then a convective zone. But they have produced no evidencefor the existence of the radiative zone and the MRI scan revealed almost noconvective zone – only one percent of that necessary for their theory to betrue. As David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill write in Thunderbolts of the Gods:[../Images/00285.jpg]Figure 68: Sunspots are punched from the outside not from within.[../Images/00573.jpg]Figure 69: The ‘torus’ seen at the ultraviolet level of the Sun.> From the smallest particle to the largest galactic formation, a web of> electrical circuitry connects and unifies all of nature, organizing galaxies,> energizing stars, giving birth to planets and, on our own world, controlling> weather and animating biological organisms. There are no isolated islands in> an electric universe.Numbers and nodesThe electrical is only one level of the universe and from this are decoded thedigital and holographic levels just as the five senses transform waveforminformation into electrical information for the brain to construct digital andholographic reality. The digital level is where numerology comes in – the studyof numbers and number sequences – and other techniques like the Chinese I-Ching.Numerology measures digital states which are digital expressions of waveform andelectrical states. When numbers appear in your life, or keep appearing, they arethe result of something happening to you at the waveform level. Skillednumerologists can read that waveform information digitally, just as a skilledastrologer can do so by the positions of the planets and stars. The DogmaDawkins of song sheet ‘science’ will once again reject the very suggestion thatnumerology and astrology have any validity, but they certainly do in the righthands. We see planets moving as physical objects, but there is no physical.Planets and stars are holographic, digital, electrical and waveform informationfields moving through the universal holographic, digital, electrical andwaveform information fields. As they do so, they are exchanging information andinfluencing the holographic, digital, electrical and waveform information statesof the energy fields with which humans are constantly interacting. The mostpowerful effect comes when planets and stars are in certain alignments whichmultiply the effect on the basis that the whole is more powerful than just thesum of the parts. We absorb the energy field into our own energetic make-up whenwe enter this reality at birth (some say conception) and our astrological fieldwill interact with the ever-changing universal field in a different way tosomeone born/conceived at a different point in the cycle (Fig 70). Theperception of ‘I’m a Taurus’, or ‘I’m a Gemini’, is correct up to a point; but Icannot stress enough that Consciousness can override anything, includingastrological influences. Those entrapped almost entirely in Body-Mind will bemost subject to them because they are the least energetically empowered. Ancientsocieties knew about astrology and numerology because the inner-circle initiatesof the secret societies and Mystery Schools were privy to knowledge that therest of the population didn’t have (just like today). The same twelveastrological signs representing the same concepts in the same order can be foundall over the ancient world. The Old Testament Book of Job refers to theMazzaroth or Zodiac, as in ‘Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in theirseason?’ Esoteric knowledge was employed in the design of great buildings whichis why you see the recurring mathematical and geometrical themes such as Pi,golden ratio (also called golden mean, golden section or Phi), and the Fibonaccisequence. The golden ratio is defined as when ‘the sum of the quantities to thelarger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smallerone’. As above, so below – the hologram! Golden ratio, or Phi, is foundthroughout nature in the way things come together in form and it is representedby the number 1.6180339887499 ... recurring to infinity. It is interesting,given that golden ratio brings forth the growth of form, that ancient initiatesbelieved that ‘fractions are numbers in the stages of becoming’. The Fibonaccisequence emerges when the last two numbers are added together to get the nextone, as in 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 ... The Fibonacci sequence, named after the12th and 13th century Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci (amongother names), can be found throughout nature in the way, for example, thatplants, flowers, trees and shells grow, and in the proportions of the humanface. This is the digital level of reality and the ancient initiates knew this.They knew that numbers and geometry were expressions of energetic states and ifthey got the numbers and geometry right in their buildings they would generatethe waveform energy which the numbers and proportions represented. The digitallevel of reality was accurately symbolised in The Matrix movie series as themoving numbers on the computer screens and in the reality that Neo experiencedonce he became Conscious (Fig 71). The American physicist featured in the NewScientist article speculating about holographic reality said that at a certainlevel of magnification ‘the fabric of space–time becomes grainy and isultimately made of tiny units rather like pixels ...’ I have told the story inother books of American brain scientist Jill Bolte-Taylor who experiencedreality as pixels when her brain’s decoding system malfunctioned during a strokein the left side of her brain (the left side is highly significant as we shallsee). She also experienced a state in which everything was One with no distinctdivision between her body and everything else in the room. The latestdevelopments in holography involve digital holograms and these are being usedfor show-stopping displays at exhibitions and sales shows. Mainstream mediareports have described how the holograms they project look so real – so solid –that people refuse to walk through them (Fig 72). Digital holograms are gettingseriously close to the holographic reality that we call the world.[../Images/00498.jpg]Figure 70: Heavenly bodies are information fields exchanging information witheach other and the universal field.[../Images/00107.jpg]Figure 71: A Conscious Neo could see the digital level of reality.[../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 72: A digital hologram.‘Seeing’ is decodingWe have the Cosmic Internet in all its various forms, but this requires an‘observer’, a decoder, just as the wireless Internet needs a computer tomanifest information onto the screen as a reality that we can see and interactwith. Ladies and gentlemen ... please welcome the human body. This, too, haswaveform, electrical, digital and holographic levels and each one interacts withits corresponding state within universal reality. The prime state of theBody-Mind computer is waveform (remember the ‘Tom’s daughter’ story) and theelectrical, digital and holographic realities are decoded expressions of thatbase information. Nor is it only the five senses that decodewaveform/vibrational information. DNA and the whole genetic structure are alsokey to the decoding process. DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic acid, is described as ‘aninformational molecule encoding the genetic instructions used in the developmentand functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses’. But it is alsoa receiver-transmitter system which receives information from the universal‘Cosmic Internet’ field and transmits it to the five senses. An Internet articlecaptured this fundamental role of DNA:> From the characteristic form of this giant molecule – a wound double helix –> the DNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is> elongated and thus a blade which can take up very well electrical pulses. On> the other hand, seen from above, it has the form of a ring and thus is a very> magnetical antenna.’Real scientists in Russia have done some outstanding research to confirm thatDNA is a receiver-transmitter of information and can create magnetised‘wormholes’ to communicate with realities beyond what is perceived as time andspace. Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist Pjotr Garjajev and his teamof researchers covering many disciplines have been pioneers in the field of whatis being called ‘wave genetics’. I have been saying all these years that‘physical’ reality emerges from waveform information fields and Pjotr Garjajevand his associates are confirming this from their experiments and research. Theyhave discovered that DNA has more than merely genetic functions. It is involvedin data storage and communication, and is a superconductor that can process vastamounts of information without losing energy in the form of heat. Technologicalsuperconductors only work at extremely low temperatures and it has beenpredicted that if they could be made to operate at room temperature thenelectronics, power and transportation would be revolutionised. Well, it hasalready been done. It is called DNA. Garjajev and his colleagues have provedthat DNA can be reprogrammed by words and frequencies, but then words arefrequencies. Everything is in our reality. They discovered that DNA can behealed with words and vibrations; but how could this not be so when it is areceiver-transmitter which can be harmonised or distorted by the nature of theinformation it receives? The Russian research group transformed frog embryos tosalamander embryos in one experiment by transmitting salamander DNA informationpatterns. But the phenomenon of ‘shapeshifting’ is not possible, right? Thepotential for healing without drugs or surgery is limitless with wave geneticsand so the Control System will do everything it can to suppress it for its owndespicable ends. This has happened with the Russian team which is being closelywatched and undermined by the Russian authorities which themselves lock into theglobal web of coordinated suppression and deceit that I will be exposing. We canheal ourselves by communicating with our own DNA using Consciousness and theRussian scientists say that this understanding of DNA as a receiver-transmittersystem could explain intuition, clairvoyance, telepathy, spontaneous healing andselfhealing, and how humans can influence each other and even the weather. It iscertainly one explanation, but there are others, too.Put simply, the body decodes and manifests itself in the form that we think wesee and experience. Or rather the mind does via the brain. The base state of thebody is waveform and by observing – decoding that waveform – we manifest the‘physical’ body that we think we see and inhabit. How can we do that without theholographic brain which also only becomes ‘physical’ when it is decoded intothat form by itself?? Because everything is happening at the waveform level. Itis the waveform level of the brain and genetic structure that decodes waveforminformation into holographic reality, including the holographic version ofitself. It is real simple if people remember that waveform is the foundationreality of the universe and anything holographic is illusory. In fact, evenwaveform is illusory in the greater scheme of things because the source ofeverything is the prime state of still, silent, All Knowing, All That Is. Theprocess of manifesting holographic reality can be ‘hacked’ and there you havethe major reason why the world is what it is as I will show. What is happeningto human reality is based on the same principle as the virtual reality games andtechnology which hack into the five senses through goggles, gloves and othertechniques to feed fake information to the senses and override ‘normal’ reality.Hypnotists are hacking the system when they implant suggestions (beliefs,programmed reality) that their stooges are playing the trombone, or the personnext to them is naked or their daughter is not in the room when she is inchesaway. Scientists have found that the brain can be hacked with information usinga headset costing less than $300. I shall be developing this theme at length.People often ask, and understandably so, that if we are creating our own realityhow come that we all see the same building, car or landscape. The answer is thatthis information is in the collective field from which we are decodingholographic reality and so we all decode – ‘see and experience’ – the same basicbackground reality. We put our unique spin on this collective reality bydeciding what we think of the building, car or landscape and how we respond toexperiences. We all see the same websites on the collective reality that is theInternet, but we don’t all go to the same ones or have the same opinion of themand interaction with them. We are also posting on the Internet as well asreceiving information and, in the same way, we transmit and receive informationin our constant interaction with the Cosmic Internet. The landscape of theuniversal field did not always include sprawling cities. Humans have done thatwith their ‘postings’, either through free-thought (the few) or by following theprogram they are constantly being fed (the great majority).‘Time’ and ‘Space’ – IlluuuusionOne other point to mention about reality before we see how fundamentally it hasbeen messed with and distorted: there is no time and there is no space – they’reboth illusions. What we experience as time and space is encoded in the waveforminformation fabric to be decoded into a perception of time and space. DVDs areonly encoded information designed to be decoded by a computer or DVD player andyet what appears on the screen seems to have ‘time’ (as scene moves to scene)and ‘space’ (illusory three-dimensional perspective and depth). These illusionsof time and space do not exist except as information on the disk decoded by thecomputer and it is the same with our experienced reality. Time and space onlyexist as information in the waveform fabric which is decoded and interpretedinto the experience of time and space by the Body-Mind biological computer (Fig73). Sports people talk about getting in ‘the zone’ when time appears to moveslower and I experienced this myself when I was a footballer. I remember onegame in particular when everything was happening in ‘real’ time (the way mybrain normally decoded reality) until a player smacked a shot at me from about12 yards away. It was a cracker of a strike and my first reaction was that itwas going passed me, but suddenly everything began to happen in slow motion andthe noise of the crowd faded and the world was silent. I began to move towardsthe ball as it slowly came towards me high to my left. The next thing I knew wasthat I was close to horizontal just under the crossbar and I stretch my neckback to see the ball diverted by my right hand just over the bar. At the momentof contact with the ball ‘real time’ crashed back in along with the roar of thecrowd in response to the save. That shot should have been unstoppable. I lay onthe floor thinking what the hell just happened? I was bewildered at what Iexperienced, but once I began to understand the nature of reality it was easy toexplain. I had simply decoded ‘time’ in a different way and so interacted withillusory reality in a different way. While I was writing this book, a study byNobuhiro Hagura at University College in London found that top sports peoplehave ‘Matrix-like abilities’ to slow down ‘time’ as they experience it. Atcrucial moments when they are preparing to respond to a shot, a pitch or a servetheir ability to process visual information speeds up and the world appears tomove more slowly. This is why great footballers are always said to have ‘moretime’ than other players and why tennis players and baseball batters can hit theball with accuracy when it is delivered to them at incredible speed. They arenot experiencing the speed that we are seeing from the stand because time isillusory.[../Images/00365.jpg]Figure 73: ‘Time’ and ‘space’ are simply decoded information. They are not‘real’ any more than a computer game is ‘real’.We look at the night sky and everything seems so ‘far’ away in decodedholographic reality; but those ‘distant’ stars are but decoded informationwithin your brain and genetic structure (Fig 74). The stars which appear to beunimaginable distances from us and each other only exist in that form within afew cubic centimetres of the brain responsible for decoding electricalinformation into vision. There is no ‘distance’ – a pinhead and infinity are oneand the same. Mainstream ‘science’ is mystified by the discovery that twoparticles can communicate instantly with each other across billions of milesbecause it continues to believe in time and space and what it calls thespacetime continuum. When you realise that the two particles are each other, andthe ‘space’ between them is an illusion, the mystery about the instantcommunication is solved. The ‘two particles’ communicating with each other onlymanifest as such anyway when the scientists are observing them. As with ‘space’,so with ‘time’. There is no such thing as time – except as encoded information.There is only the eternal NOW. By that I don’t mean the NOW as another word forthe ‘present’ in the sense of past-present-future. I mean the NOW in which past,present and future are all the same experience. It can be near impossible formost people to grasp this given the power of ingrained, life-long ‘time’programming. But think about it. First of all clock ‘time’ is a nonsense, as iscalendar ‘time’. I saw a picture of graffiti written on a wall which said: ‘Timedoesn’t exist. Clocks exist.’ Perfect. How can you take clock ‘time’ seriouslywhen you can cross an invisible line in the ocean (the International Date Line)and go into tomorrow or yesterday depending on your direction of travel? It’snot even straight (Figs 75 and 76). The Gregorian calendar which charts the‘passage of time’ through the year was imposed by Papal decree courtesy of PopeGregory XIII in 1582 and when it was introduced they had to delete a series ofdays to make it fit. September 2nd at the changeover was followed by September14th. Yes, time is real, right? But surely time must exist because we rememberthe ‘past’ and worry about, or look forward to, the ‘future’. Okay, so where arewe when we have the experience that eventually becomes a memory of the ‘past’?In the NOW, the only moment that exists. Where are we when we are having thememory of that experience in the ‘past’? In the NOW. Where are we when we thinkabout the ‘future’? In the NOW. There is only the NOW, just as there is onlyInfinity, Eternity, All Possibility and the All Knowing ‘Is-ness’. Put a DVDmovie into the player and you have the experience of ‘time’ passing as scenefollows scene. The scene you are watching at any point is your perception of thepresent; those you have watched are your perception of the ‘past’; and the onesyou have yet to see are in your perception of the ‘future’. But the entire movieexists in the same NOW, on the same disc, and your perception of past, presentand future is merely dictated by the point on the disc that the laser is readingin the NOW (Fig 77). Time is an illusion and highly significant with regard tohuman servitude, as we shall see. William Blake, the great British artist andpoet, captured the illusion of time and space when he wrote:[../Images/00218.jpg]Figure 74: The stars may seem to be staggering distances ‘away’ but in the formwe ‘see’ them they occupy only a small area of the brain.[../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 75: Cross an invisible line in the ocean and you move into yesterday ortomorrow. Time is real?[../Images/00186.jpg]Figure 76: Even crazier ... the International Dateline isn’t even straight.[../Images/00161.jpg]Figure 77: Where you ‘are’ dictates your perception of where you have ‘been’ andwhere you have ‘yet’ to ‘go’.> To see a world in a grain of sand and a Heaven in a wild flower,> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand and Eternity in an hour.Blake also wrote: ‘He to whom time is the same as eternity, and eternity thesame as time, is free of all adversity.’ Near-Death experiencers who have seenbeyond the Body-Mind computer and returned to tell their story confirm thetransformation of their reality once they are free of the decoded perception ofwhat I call the Body-Mind biological computer. This account brings it alltogether:> ... everything from the beginning, my birth, my ancestors, my children, my> wife, everything comes together simultaneously. I saw everything about me, and> about everyone who was around me. I saw everything they were thinking now,> what they thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now.> There is no time, there is no sequence of events, no such thing as limitation,> of distance, of period, of place. I could be anywhere I wanted to be> simultaneously.This is who we are – and more – and the fact that human society is not foundedupon that understanding of self and reality has caused our insane world tomanifest. This prime distortion in the perception of reality originates from awaveform and thus holographic distortion which has been encoded into the veryfabric of human society. So where did this distortion come from? Who would wantthis to be a world of deprivation, conflict, suffering and ignorance? And why?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00023.jpg]How We Got Into This Bollocks– The CatastropheWonder is the beginning of wisdom.SocratesYou need only one thing to get maximum benefit from what I am presenting in thisbook and that is an open mind. Not a naïve one; not an ‘I’ll believe anythingyou tell me’ one; and certainly not the kind that says ‘I have reached myconclusions, the concrete is set, and I have guards at the gate with machetes ifyou fancy a go’.I mean a mind that is merely open and one for which information, insight andintuitive knowing is the guiding light and not pre-conceived idea and unyieldingbelief. One of the most profound and powerful means of mass human control is toprogram a sense of the possible and by that I mean to suppress and compress intomyopia the sense of what is, and isn’t, possible. Anyone with a limited sense ofthe possible is a prisoner and a slave of their own mind. Well, sort of. Someonein this state doesn’t really have their own mind, only a software program thathas downloaded the perceptions of the Control System ‘App’ that has been playingin their mind since they left the womb – even before that as experiments haveindicated. This ‘App’ starts with parents passing on their programmedperceptions to their children from the earliest age and continues through allthe years of what is bravely called ‘education’ and through the mainstream mediaand the constant confirmation of reality by friends and peers who have the same‘App’ running in their own heads. This is how complete ‘scientific’, historicaland official story claptrap becomes an ‘everybody knows that’. American writerElwyn Brooks White was correct when he said: ‘The world is full of people whohave never, since childhood, met an open doorway with an open mind.’ Many noteven during childhood, so early does the programming begin. People were onceridiculed for saying that the Earth was a sphere because the ‘App’ said that itcouldn’t be. The most ludicrous nonsense, and since acknowledged as being so,has been believed and acted upon over thousands of years because the ‘App’ saidit was true. I asked artist Neil Hague to produce the image in Figure 78 tosymbolise my point about the prison-like nature of a suppressed sense of thepossible. When the lies and misunderstandings of the official version ofeverything enter the mind, symbolically on the left here, they can only bechallenged by opening the ‘other side’ of the mind to an expanded sense of thepossible. If this does not happen then the mind has no alternative to the lieand thus accepts the lie to be truth. For example, if you don’t know or accepthow easy it is to mind control someone to go crazy with a gun in a school in aneffort to justify disarming the population then the official fairy tale mustprevail in your sense of reality. If you cannot expand your sense of thepossible beyond what mainstream ‘science’ says is possible and impossible, rightand wrong, true and untrue, then you become a life-long mind-slave to itsversion of everything (see the Skeptics Society). So if that is where you areand there is no budging then you are reading the wrong book. You want somethingby Professor Richard Dawkins, BBC science-mainstreamer Professor Brian Cox andtheir ilk. But it is worth recalling a quote by another American writer, DerekBok: ‘The greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing about.’With all that said, I’ll begin the story of human history and enslavement thatyou won’t find at any school or university or in the official version ofanything ...[../Images/00299.jpg]Figure 78: A closed mind which refuses to even explore other possibilities isdestined to believe the lie in the absence of any perceived ‘credible’alternative.The world was not always like it is today and neither was the human form. Theywere once very different – so different that it can be hard to comprehend howdramatically life in this reality has been twisted and distorted. Fortunately,visual aids have been provided by movies such as The Matrix, in terms of howthings are, and Avatar in relation to how they once were. I don’t know if thatwas the intention of Avatar writer and director James Cameron, but when you readancient accounts from cultures across the world of a once great or Golden Age ofhumanity it is clear that the blue people, or Na’vi, in Avatar experienced lifepretty much the way the ancients described the Golden Age. Humans had a far moreexpanded Consciousness/Awareness and they knew, as the Na’vi did, thateverything was connected. We saw this portrayed in Avatar as the Na’vicommunicating with the animals, trees and the rest of nature. This is possiblebecause the communication is via the energetic information fields – the ocean –that connects everything and the medium is not words, but thought. The braindecodes human sound communication (language) which is received by the ears as aresonating information field and then delivered to the brain in electrical form.This ‘language’ is actually an information field vibrated into existence by thevocal chords for the ears to decode. But take another step back in the processand the vocal chords are responding to the person’s thought processes and humanlanguage is really the communication of thought in vibrational form. We onlyhear language when the brain decodes it and not before. Communication withoutlanguage between people, plants, animals etc., is done as pure thought(telepathy) which is the communication of energetic information directly and notvia the five senses (Fig 79). People are called crazy if they talk to plantsbecause how could a plant understand them? This is still more ridicule thatoriginates from the ignorance of the ridiculer. The person talking to the plantis generating a vibrating information field and the plant simply decodes theinformation without the need to go through the middle man of language. The Na’viin Avatar were aware that all is One, and so once was humanity, or moreaccurately ‘Earth people’, because they were so different to what we recogniseas humans today. The Na’vi did not have money and did not apply a monetary‘value’ to land and ‘resources’. Their ‘resources’ were the plentiful food andsustenance provided by living in harmony with their reality instead, as withhumanity today, of being at war with it. The Na’vi and ancient (as we perceive‘time’) humanity were heart societies and I’ll explain what I mean by that.There are major energy vortexes that interpenetrate the human energy field andconnect the holographic ‘body’ to other levels of being (Fig 80). The vortexesare known as chakras, an ancient Sanskrit word meaning ‘wheels of light’.[../Images/00073.jpg]Figure 79: Communication that bypasses the five senses.[../Images/00357.jpg]Figure 80: The human chakra vortex system.They are:The crown chakra on top of the head; the brow (or ‘third eye’) chakra in thecentre of the forehead; the throat chakra; the heart chakra in the centre of thechest; the solar plexus chakra located just below the sternum; the sacral chakralocated just beneath the navel; and the base chakra at the bottom of the spine.Each one has a particular function or functions. The crown chakra has thepotential to connect us to higher levels of Consciousness; the brow chakra givesus access to psychic communication beyond this reality and connects with thepineal and pituitary glands in the brain that together are known as the‘third-eye’; the throat chakra relates to communication and creativity –including vibrational communication (language/sound) via the vocal chords; theheart chakra is our potential connection to the highest levels of awareness,innate intelligence which cannot be taught, intuition and ‘knowing’; the solarplexus chakra is a seat of raw power that can be used for good or ill andstrongly influences our emotional state; the sacral chakra relates to emotionsand sexuality (which is why people feel emotion in that area and ‘get the shits’when they are fearful or nervous as this chakra interacts with theintestine/colon); the base chakra grounds and connects us to the reality ofBody-Mind that we call the Earth. The key vortex is the heart chakra. It is thebalance point for the other six – the lower three largely relate to this realityand the higher three largely to expanded levels of awareness and communication.The heart is the governor sitting at the centre, or should be, and ispotentially – emphasis on potentially – our connection to Infinite Self (Fig81). The Institute of HeartMath in the United States has been a pioneer ofresearch into the true nature and function of the heart and has confirmed theuniqueness and crucial importance of the heart and heart vortex to humanity’ssense of reality. The heart has the most powerful electromagnetic field withinthe human energy field and there are more nerves going from the heart to thebrain than going the other way. The latter is indicative of a sparkling truththat has been long forgotten – the brain is not the focus for intelligencewithin the body – the heart is. Or should be. The heart is also a brain withsomething like 40,000 neurons of different types and neurotransmitters likethose found in the head-brain. What is known as the heart-brain bothcommunicates with the head-brain and functions independently. Deborah Rozman,president and CEO of HeartMath LLC in California, wrote:[../Images/00059.jpg]Figure 81: The heart vortex or chakra is the seat of innate intelligence and aconnection to the greater self beyond the illusion.> When I was a practicing psychologist, sometimes when I’d be working with a> client who was confused about an issue or decision, I’d ask, ‘What would your> heart say?’ I often adapted a gestalt technique using two chairs.

The Institute of HeartMath has alsoestablished that when the energetic field of the heart is in harmony andelectromagnetic coherence with the brain and the central nervous system theperson enters a far more expanded state of awareness. Vital to this ‘trinity’ ofconnection is the energetic coherence and balance of the heart. By thisdefinition, humans of the Golden Age and the Na’vi in Avatar were heartsocieties in that their point or focus of connection and interaction with theirreality was the heart and heart chakra or vortex. This gave them a communicationchannel to higher states of awareness and so an understanding, a knowing, thateverything is One. This innate cosmic knowing creates a very different societyand way of living to when the heart is suppressed and the brain rules perception– witness our world of today.The InvadersSo what happened to the ‘heart’ people? Funnily enough, something very close towhat happened to the Na’vi in Avatar except for a very different outcome – sofar. The Na’vi were infiltrated and invaded, but repelled the invaders once theyrealised what was happening. Humans of the Golden Age did not repel theirinvaders and today more than seven billion humans still don’t know what ishappening in terms of the scale, depth and ultimate nature of their control.Only a tiny minority get anywhere close. You can’t repel a force that you don’tknow, or will not accept, even exists. The US military were depicted as theinvaders in Avatar, set sometime in the ‘future’, when they sought to secureresources beneath where the Na’vi lived which were worth a financial fortuneback home. The military were ‘head’ or ‘gut’ people who had no understanding orconcept of the Na’vi’s heart-centred way of life and therefore no respect orsensitivity for them. They just wanted to kill and oppress to get their hands onthe resources and turn them into ‘loot’. This leads to another ‘funnily enough’.The same themes can be found in ancient accounts all over the world about aninvading force that infiltrated and hijacked our reality and brought an end tothe Golden Age society amid incredible cataclysmic events which included a‘Great Flood’, or global tsunami (Fig 82). Thousands of clay tablets andfragments found in what is now Iraq tell the story of how a non-humaninvader-race known as the Anunna, or Anunnaki (‘Those Who From Heaven To EarthCame’ in at least one translation), arrived on Earth to force humans to mine forgold in Africa. For sure, there is evidence of gold mining in Africa 100,000years ago. The Tablets were accounts of human history compiled by ancientsocieties in Mesopotamia (‘The Land Between Two Rivers’ – the Tigris andEuphrates) which was once the location of Sumer (approximately 3000-1800 BC) andBabylon (approximately 1800-539 BC in its different forms). The Tablets – I willcall them the Sumerian Tablets – describe how the Anunnaki that came to Earthwere led by two brothers, Enlil and Enki, who ultimately answered to their‘father’, Anu, the ‘Lord of the Sky’. Zulu accounts in South Africa tell thesame story about the Chitauri (‘Children of the Serpent’ or ‘Children of thePython’) which are said to be a reptilian race that came to Africa to forcehumans to mine for gold. Zulu lore says that the Chitauri were led by twobrothers, Wowane and Mpanku. They were known as the ‘water brothers’ and if youlook at the Mesopotamian accounts of the Anunnaki at least one of theirbrothers, Enki (Ea to the Babylonians), was symbolised as the god of freshwaters. The Sumerian Tablets and the Zulu accounts are clearly referring to thesame invading force which strongly appears to take a reptilian form, althoughfar from entirely. The Tablets and Zulu accounts indicate that it was theAnunnaki-Chitauri who were responsible for creating the cataclysmic events thatbrought an end to human society as it had been before. The Tablets tell of howEnki warned a human ‘priest-king’ called Ziusudra about this. He gaveinstructions to build a huge ship to survive the coming flood and to take aboard‘beasts and birds’. Thousands of years later these stories appeared withdifferent names in the Bible as Noah surviving the flood with family and animalsthanks to being warned by ‘God’ to build a great ‘Ark’. The Bible story focussesit all on Hebrew people when they were nowhere mentioned in the originalaccounts from which the plagiarising biblical version was derived. You find the‘Noah’ character all over the world in guises such as Deucalion (Greece), Manu(India), Fo-hi (China), Xisthros (Persia), Nota (Mexico), and Utnapishtim(Mesopotamia). The ‘God’ of the Bible is in part a collective name for thenon-human invaders with their high technology and this is why there are stillremnants of the original meaning in the Bible when it tells of how ‘God’ (thegods) decided to create humans in our image – not my image, but our image,plural. There are other examples of this recurring theme which I will come toshortly.[../Images/00548.jpg]Figure 82: Changing the game.The story of extraordinary cataclysmic events on Earth that virtually wiped outthe previous human society has been with me almost from the start of myincredible journey of discovery since 1990. I found the same story in allancient societies that I researched and the geological and biological recordabsolutely supports what they say happened. The legends of two vast continents,called Atlantis and Mu/Lemuria, sinking beneath the Atlantic and Pacific Oceansare often connected to these stories. It is said, and I agree, that Australia,New Zealand and the Pacific islands are the remains of Mu. I have detailed allthis at length in other books and I won’t repeat it all here, but the tales ofglobal cataclysm are countless and can be found in Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea(both in Mesopotamia), Greece, Arcadia, Rome, Scandinavia, Germany, Lithuania,Transylvania, Turkey, Persia, China, New Zealand, Siberia, Burma, Korea, Taiwan,Philippines and Sumatra, in Islamic and Celtic lore, and among native peoplesthroughout North, South and Central America, Africa, Asia, Australia and thePacific. Consistent themes include a great heat that boiled the sea; mountainsbreathing fire; a darkened sky; raining down of blood, ice and rock; the Earthflipping over; the sky ‘falling’; the rising and sinking of land; the loss ofgreat continents; the coming of the ice; and a gigantic tsunami that sweptacross the planet (which would happened if the Earth ‘flipped over’). Those whohave compared these accounts with the planet’s biological and geological recordhave found that one supports the other (see The Biggest Secret, Human Race GetOff Your Knees and Remember Who You Are). So much of the Earth’s landscape todayis so different to what it was before cataclysmic events around 11,500 to 13,000years ago (and there have been many others). The scientific record confirms theclaims by the ancients that mountains soared out of the Earth while otherscrumbled as the world was torn asunder (see the book, When the Earth Nearly Diedby D S Allan and J B Delair and others on the same subject). Great canyons, likeAmerica’s Grand Canyon, were scored out during the upheavals – the idea thatthis incredible chasm in the Earth’s surface was worn away by the Colorado Riveris too ludicrous for words. I have looked down from the edge of it several timesand the Colorado River is a tiny sliver in the distance. Any conscious personstanding there and hearing that the river is claimed to have carved out thisgiant cavern would just laugh. All over the world you find scattered rocks knownas ‘erratics’ with often no connection to the surrounding bedrock. The officialstory is that they were delivered by glaciers when the ice is supposed to havemelted around 11 thousand years ago, but I don’t accept the ‘ice age’ story asrepeated from the official ‘scientific’ song sheet, and it is blatantly obviousthat these rocks were scattered across the world by a global tsunami in thatsame period (and others) of 11,500 to13,000 years ago, hence coming to restnowhere near where they originated. Witness what has happened with moderntsunamis which, devastating as they have been, are as nothing compared with whatthe ancients describe in their many and various accounts of the Great Flood.There are more than 2,000 versions of the same basic flood and cataclysm storyworldwide. Mainstream geology has dismissed the flood explanation for theformation of the landscape and so they have had to resort to the ridiculous andinane – like the claims about the Grand Canyon. David R Montgomery, Professor ofEarth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, highlightedthis geological nonsense in an article in Discover Magazine headed‘Biblical-Type Floods Are Real, and They’re Absolutely Enormous’. He wrote:> After teaching geology at the University of Washington for a decade, I had> become embarrassed that I hadn’t yet seen the deep canyons where tremendous> Ice Age floods scoured down into solid rock to sculpt the scablands.

Writer and researcher Gary Gilligan points out that the Amazonrainforest, home to half of all life on Earth, can only have existed for a fewthousand years and not the 55 million claimed by modern ‘science’. This isbecause the Amazon depends on the 40 million tons of mineral-rich desert dust,originating in the African Sahara, which drops on the Amazon in rain every yearand the Sahara Desert has only been forming out of a once lush subtropicallandscape for a few thousand years. How so much sand formed in the Sahara tostart with has not been explained either.‘Solid’ evidenceThere is other ‘physical’ evidence for all this, too, and for a highly-advancedglobal civilisation that ended amid catastrophic geological events. Austrianresearcher Klaus Dona is one of many involved in this area of research and youcan see one of his excellent presentations if you put ‘Klaus Dona, The HiddenHistory of the Human Race’, into YouTube. He points out that in 1984 a pyramidand other monuments were found 25 metres under the sea off the Japanese islandof Yonaguni. They included stone streets, a stadium/Coliseum-type structure andhuge depictions of a turtle and a bird. Some mainstream archaeologists havetried to say that this is all natural phenomena because their whole world-viewis at stake if they acknowledge that it isn’t; but for goodness sake you onlyhave to look at them (Figs 83, 84 and 85). Similar monuments and structures havebeen found off the Atlantic island of Bimini and elsewhere. Ancient maps of theworld have been found drawn on stones that accurately portray known coastlines,but also include enormous landmasses in the Atlantic and Pacific where Atlantisand Mu are said to have been. One was found by gold miners in Ecuador along with350 other artefacts which don’t appear to fit with any known South Americanculture and are estimated to be thousands of years old. The stone map includesan eye placed in the Middle East close to Saudi Arabia. The eye, or all-seeingeye, is a prime symbol used to this day by the secret societies and familiesbehind the global Control System and a radiant and shining eye is often used inthe symbol of a pyramid with the capstone raised above the main structure – aswith the image on the US dollar bill (Fig 86). The words in Latin underneathrefer to a ‘New Order for the Ages’, or New World Order (the name the secretsocieties give to their plan for world domination). How extraordinary, then, ifyou don’t know the story that among those hundreds of ancient artefacts found inthe goldmine in Ecuador is a virtually identical image of the same pyramid andall-seeing eye (Fig 87). Not only that, when the pyramid is placed inultraviolet light, or ‘black light’, the eye shines (Fig 88). Many ancient textsdescribe entities with light shining from their eyes and they are often referredto as the ‘shining ones’. I met a man in the Netherlands quite a few years agowho embarked on this area of research after his former wife, who had been actingand behaving strangely, went to her car in the darkness one night. When hefollowed her out he realised that a light was coming from somewhere and shiningon her car – it turned out to be coming from her eyes. The Ecuador pyramid alsohas 13 levels beneath the eye and this again matches the one on the dollar bill.On the base of the pyramid is a depiction of the Orion Constellation (whichturns up often in ancient artefacts) and there are words in an unknown language.Professor Kurt Schildmann, a president of the German Linguistic Association, whois fluent in more than 40 languages, said was it was older than the oldest knownhuman writing. He called it ‘pre-Sanskrit’. His translation of the writing onthe bottom of the pyramid was: ‘The son of the creator comes’. This is afamiliar theme, of course, but my question is what son of what ‘creator’? I’llexplore this later. Klaus Dona says that the same form of writing has been foundaround the world in locations such as Colombia, the United States, France,Malta, Turkmenistan, Australia and Italy, and it has similarities with writingfound on Easter Island, a remnant of Mu/Lemuria and famous for its uniquewildlife and massive and unexplained statues of the ‘gods’ (Fig 89).‘Pre-Sanskrit’ means that the writing must be more than 6,000 years old and itis highly likely to have been the written communication of the once-global‘Avatar’ society. An artefact depicting a half-human, half-reptile figure founddeep under the ground in Sierra Leone, West Africa, had a metal ball sealedinside. It was first x-rayed to confirm this and when the ball was recovered itwas found to be made of chrome steel which has only been discovered inrelatively modern times and yet the statue in which it was sealed has beenestimated to be 17,000 years old! But, then, a precisely machined and shapedcube of metal was found in the centre of a block of coal in Austria in 1885which must have been made some 300,000 years ago. A piece of gold thread foundin Rutherford Mills, England, in 1844, embedded in eight feet of rock wasestimated to be 60 million years old.[../Images/00180.jpg]Figure 83, 84 and 85: The sunken ancient city off the Japanese island ofYonaguni.[../Images/00340.jpg]Figure 86: The ancient symbol of the pyramid and all-seeing eye used by theglobal secret society network today and it can be seen on the dollar bill andthe reverse of the Great Seal of the United States.[../Images/00079.jpg]Figure 87: This was found by Ecuador miners in 1984 and is at least thousands ofyears old.

How many people knowany of this? Why isn’t it taught in schools? The answer is that the ControlSystem doesn’t want us to know the true history of humanity because far too manydominoes would start to fall that would lead inevitably to revealing connectionswith current events and those in power today. I will be making those veryconnections in this book. An amazing structure has been discovered in Turkeythat archaeologists claim to have dated to 12,000 years ago, perhaps more.Gobekli Tepe, near the city of Sanliurfa in south-east Turkey, consists ofmainly circular and oval-shaped structures located on the top of a hill (Fig90). Within the circles are T-shaped pillars each weighing between 40 and 60tonnes and decorated with carved animals. Geomagnetic surveys indicate thatthere are hundreds more still buried. The question mainstream archaeologists askis once again how could this have been done at a time when humans were workingwith primitive hand tools? In fact, the archaeological dig by Turkish and Germanteams has forced many of them to rethink their perception of human history. Thefind has caused more head-shaking and bewilderment about the start of what theycall human civilisation. It would appear that whoever built these structuresspecifically buried them deep under sand when they abandoned them and this iswhy they are so well preserved.American author and researcher Michael Cremo began studying the history of humanexistence after reading dozens of original scientific reports that described thediscovery of human bones and artefacts millions of years old – information thatwas censored from the text books. This is how the suppression of knowledgeworks. The public is denied the facts that would open their minds to a greaterunderstanding of where we are, who we are and, therefore, what is reallyhappening today. ‘Darwinism’ was a ‘scientific’ scam to sell the belief that‘evolution’ can only go ‘forward’ through the socalled survival of the fittest.This belief-system was specifically created to remove from the ‘scientific’mainstream, and so academia in all its forms, any idea that there could oncehave been more advanced societies than ours (surely not difficult). When thishad been deleted from ‘science’ and academia, it was largely deleted from thepublic mind – job done. But Darwinism is shockingly nonsensical in the face oflogic and the supporting evidence that societies can advance and decline basedon the level of knowledge available. Given that knowledge can be lost orsuppressed, societies can advance and decline. Nothing makes them declinequicker, of course, than global geological disasters, of which there have beenmany. Acclaimed astronomer and author Sir Fred Hoyle (1915-2001) made hisopinion of Darwinism very clear. He said:> The likelihood of the formation of life from inanimate matter is one to a> number with 40,000 noughts after it ... It is big enough to bury Darwin and> the whole theory of evolution. There was no primeval soup, neither on this> planet nor on any other, and if the beginnings of life were not random, they> must therefore have been the product of purposeful intelligence.Exactly, and I will be exploring the nature of that ‘intelligence’.A new worldWhat happened to the Earth was the result of a much bigger catastrophe thataffected much of the solar system. Many planets and stars (I say that at leastSaturn and Jupiter are dwarf stars, not planets) were not where we see themtoday before disaster struck. The Russian-American scholar Immanuel Velikovsky(1895-1979) pioneered research into these events in books such as Worlds inCollision, Ages in Chaos, and Earth in Upheaval (Fig 91). Velikovsky contendedthat chaos in the solar system led to planets like Mars and Venus being ejectedfrom their original orbits to where they are today. He was naturally vilifiedand ridiculed by the ‘scientific’ establishment, but then who isn’t that hasanything valid to say and contribute to human understanding? Velikovsky’s majorthemes, though not all the detail, have been supported by present-dayresearchers such as David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill, who are also theleading proponents of the Electric Universe. The connection is more thancoincidence. To understand the workings and electrical/electromagnetic forces atwork in the solar system is to understand how it would be possible for such adisaster to occur. I said earlier that planets and stars do not secure theirstable orbits from gravity, but from electromagnetic fields and forces. Thismeans that anything that distorts and seriously disrupts those forces will causethe planets and bodies to become unstable and in extreme circumstances to gowalkabout. This clearly happened when you look at the evidence presented byVelikovsky, Talbott and Thornhill – and happened relatively recently, too. Weare talking thousands of years, not millions (as we perceive ‘time’). Thegeneral thrust of this research today is that before the last great upheavalsVenus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbited the Sun in very differentpositions and relationships than we see now. They were much closer to the Earthand appeared as giant bodies, Talbott says. The prime and closest sun inrelation to the Earth was what we call today Saturn, which, like Jupiter, is adwarf star and not a planet. Talbott says that Saturn’s orbit in relation to theEarth made it appear to be standing still. The ancients called Saturn ‘theSteadfast One’. Saturn did not have rings at this point, or at least rings thatcould be seen as they are today and was aligned, when viewed from the Earth,with Mars and Venus (Fig 92). David Talbott says that this was the ‘Golden Age’configuration and he came to this conclusion after decades of reading ancientaccounts from all over the world. The result of this work can be seen in hismagnificent book, The Saturn Myth. I’ll be expanding on all of this andrevealing the fundamental significance of Saturn in coming chapters. Talbottsays that at some point Mars lost stability and began to come closer to theEarth. So close, in fact, that fantastic electrical discharges on anunimaginable scale were exchanged with the Earth. This is the origin, he says,of the ‘thunderbolts of the gods’ theme globally recorded in myth and legend(Fig 93).[../Images/00169.jpg]Figure 91: Immanuel Velikovsky.> [../Images/00058.jpg]> Figure 92: A ringless Saturn with Venus and Mars at the centre as seen from> Earth before the cataclysms, according to the extensive research of David> Talbott> [../Images/00208.jpg]> Figure 93: Neil Hague’s depiction of Earth and Mars exchanging enormous> electrical charges.Velikovsky believed that the arrival of Jupiter into the solar system had causedone of many incredible upheavals with a near collision with Saturn thatrearranged planetary orbits. He said that ‘in the near collision with Jupiter,Saturn, of much larger mass than at present, was disrupted’ and he believed that‘Jupiter swept up the dispersed material’ and eventually ‘underwent fission’.Velikovsky also contended that the effect of Jupiter caused Saturn to experience‘a nova’ (a cataclysmic nuclear explosion in a dwarf star). Ancient accounts saythat Saturn was the chief among the gods until his throne was seized by Jupiter.It is highly likely that the Greek myths about the battle of the Titans andOlympians for supremacy over the Earth are symbolic of Saturn (Titans) andJupiter (Olympians). Many of Saturn’s moons are named after Titans and thebiggest one is called Titan. Whatever the precise background, these bodiesbecame so destabilised by the electromagnetic forces being thrown into disarrayand chaos that they careered out of control before finding a new stability inthe locations that we see them now (Fig 94). Mars was an inhabited planet beforethis and it was not devastated millions of years ago but relatively recentlyduring the events that I am describing, and many proponents of the cataclysmicversion of history, including Velikovsky, say that the asteroid belt betweenMars and Jupiter is the remains of another planet destroyed by theseextraordinary events.[../Images/00109.jpg]Figure 94: The solar system in its post-cataclysmic state. Velikovsky and otherssuggest that the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is the remains of aplanet destroyed in the upheavals.They may well be right, and likely are, but I don’t have to accept every detailof what this area of research is suggesting for me to absolutely agree with thetheme: all hell broke loose in the ‘heavens’, bodies like Saturn, Venus, Marsand Jupiter dramatically changed locations and the Earth was utterly devastated.It was bye, bye, ‘Golden Age’ and all that went with it."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00002.jpg]How We Got Into This Bollocks– The ArchonsDetails make perfection, and perfection is not a detail.Leonardo da VinciThe Sumerian Tablets describe how the Anunnaki caused the global catastrophes inorder to virtually wipe out humanity and start again with a new genetic type.What followed is another common theme in ancient accounts and this is where theBiblical ‘making Man in my (our) image’ comes in with the sons of God (the gods,plural, in the true translation) producing children with the daughters of men.The Sumerian Tablets describe how the Anunnaki interbred with humans andgenetically-manipulated the human body (body-computer) for reasons that I willcome to. This does not have to be done only, primarily or even at all byprocreation because there are technological means that I will be describing. Theinvading force, which is obsessed with genetics and technology, appears undermany different names in ancient cultures throughout the world. Once you realisethat these various names are all the same force it all starts to make sense. Theinvaders are mostly described as being reptilian in nature although there are anumber of different forms and among them are those known today as the ‘Greys’with bulbous heads and big black ‘eyes’. Others look virtually like we do. I amgoing to pull them all together shortly, but I’ll stay with the reptilian themefor now. Credo Mutwa, the Zulu sanusi, or high shaman, and official historianthat I mentioned previously, painted one of the reptilian worker-class, or‘antclass’, from ancient and modern descriptions (he says he has also seen themhimself) and look how similar the image is to those painted by a Spanish artistRobert Llimos in 2009 after an experience that he had in Brazil (Figs 95 and96). I met Robert when I spoke in Barcelona in 2010. He said that he was alonein the countryside painting the landscape on a trip to Brazil when a craft thathe estimated to be 50 metres across came down in front of him and stayed therefor two hours (Fig 97). Robert knew nothing about reptilian entities or anythingelse to do with ‘other-world’ realities and he had never heard of me and my workat the time. But he says that as he watched he saw two reptilian entities, onemale and one female, standing at the only open window in the craft. He has nomemory of being taken on board, but then if he was he almost certainly would notremember because of the mind games they play and firewalls they install. What hedid do, however, given that he had his easel and paints, was record what he saw.People can go into denial and dismissal as much as they like, but these entitiesexist and they are manipulating our world. The mythology of the ancient AfricanSan people, or ‘Bushmen’, says that humans were created in the Tsodilo Hills inthe Kalahari Desert of Botswana when the ‘Great Python’ arrived with a ‘bag ofeggs’. Interestingly, the oldest form of human religious worship so faruncovered is the worship of the serpent or python which goes back at least70,000 years to ... the Tsodilo Hills of Botswana. This was established bySheila Coulson, an archaeologist from the University of Oslo, Norway, and theSan/Bushmen accounts support the assertion in the Sumerian Tablets that theAnunnaki first located in Africa where they forced human slaves to mine gold forthem. Credo Mutwa told me that the name ‘Africa’ derives from the ancient word‘Wafirika’ which means ‘the first people on Earth’, or ‘the first people here’.‘Zulu’ means ‘people from the stars’ because they say they were seeded by starpeople. My own view is that what is being described is not the creation ofhumans, or people of the Earth, but the new genetically-manipulated humansspecifically designed to be slaves of the invading force in all its forms.[../Images/00102.jpg]Figure 95: Credo Mutwa’s depiction of one type of reptilian entity from ancientand modern descriptions ...[../Images/00540.jpg]Figure 96: ... and the similarity is obvious in this painting by Spanish artistRobert Llimos in 2009.© www.robertllimos.es [http://www.robertllimos.es][../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 97: Robert said that this was the craft that descended and hovered infront of him with the two entities standing at the only uncovered window.Rebecca Cann, Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Hawaii,coauthored a study in 1987 in the journal, Nature, detailing evidence thatmodern humans are descended from a single mother who lived in Africa in about200,000 BC and comparisons were made in media reports with the story of thebiblical Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden who were, according to the tale,corrupted by a snake or serpent. This same story can be found in many othercultures, including ancient China, and worship of the serpent was global inscale. It can be found, among other places, in: Egypt; Persia; Asia Minor (nowTurkey); Phoenicia; Arabia and the Middle East; India and Asia; China; Japan;Ethiopia and the rest of Africa; Mexico; Britain; Scandinavia; Italy; Greece;Crete; Rhodes; Cyprus; Sri Lanka; Northern and Western Europe; and North, Southand Central America. The Mayan people in what is now Mexico, about whom so muchnonsense was spoken and written with regard to their alleged ‘prophecies’ about2012, said that their ancestors were the ‘people of the serpent’. The Mayansworshipped the serpent god Kukulkan, the ‘Plumed Serpent’ or ‘Feathered Serpent’that was mirrored by similar deities in Central America such as Quetzalcoatl,the feathered serpent god of the Aztecs. The cult of Kukulkan was centred onChichén Itzá in the Yucatán, Mexico, where substantial remains have survived(Fig 98). I was there once during a partial eclipse of the Sun and I found theenergy of the place to be horrible – the feel was very much the same as manylocations that I have visited all over the world associated with the reptilianentities and the human sacrifice which ancient accounts invariably say theyalways demanded. This is the origin of making sacrifices to the ‘gods’ and Iwill explain more about this later. It was also the origin of Satanism whichcontinues to worship the same demonic ‘gods’ to this day. Ninth century textsdiscovered at Chichén Itzá do not associate Kukulkan with being human. Artisticdepictions portray ‘him’ as a ‘Vision Serpent entwined around the figures ofnobles’ and also presiding over scenes of sacrifice. The Mayans said that areptilian race known as the ‘Iguana Men’ came from the sky and taught them howto build pyramids (Fig 99). I have been saying for many years that reptilianentities were behind the building of pyramids across the world, including themost famous ones in Egypt. I don’t feel at all good about these or any othersfrom similar origins. I say they are part of the rewiring and manipulation ofthe Earth’s energy grid ‘ley line’ network which dictates the nature of theplanet’s electromagnetic field with which we are constantly interacting as partof the interchange with the Cosmic Internet. Some researchers have suggestedthat the three pyramids at Giza represent the three stars of Orion’s Belt and itis certainly true that the constellation of Orion comes up again and again inremains and artefacts from the ancient world. When I was interviewed for theHistory Channel series, Ancient Aliens, one of the questions was why symbols orother references related to Orion occur so often. The Mayans say the firstsettlers of the Yucatan were the Chanes or ‘People of the Serpent’ led by thegod Itzamna. This name is said by some to derive from ‘itzem’ (lizard orreptile) and this would translate their sacred city of Itzamna as ‘the place ofthe lizard’ or ‘Iguana House’. This mirrors the themes of the Zulu legends aboutthe Chitauri.[../Images/00431.jpg]Figure 98: The Mayan serpent god Kukulkan at Chichén Itzá.[../Images/00157.jpg]Figure 99: The Mayan pyramid at Chichén ItzáJourneys of the ‘serpent people’Researcher and writer James Churchward described in books such as The Childrenof Mu how he had established that the Mayans of Central America and those knownas the Nagas, or Naga-Maya, in Asia were expressions of the same peoples whichhad survived the devastating demise of Mu/Lemuria in the Pacific Ocean.Churchward said that he was shown ancient tablets in the secret vault of amonastery in northern India that described how the Naacals or Naga Mayas(‘serpents’) from Mu/Lemuria relocated to India via Burma to establish a colonythere. Hindu legend says the Nagas could take either a human or reptilian format will. This is known as ‘shapeshifting’ and it can be done because the body isenergetically fluid and not ‘solid’. I’ll go into this more later on, but whileshapeshifting would appear to be impossible it is very simple to explain. JamesChurchward said that his research had established that the Nagas also populatedChina, Tibet and many parts of Asia. A stone from the Ecuadorian ‘find’ includesthe allseeing eye and symbols very much like those found by Churchward in Indiain 1880 which related to the serpent-human Nagas people. Survivors from Muheaded for what is now Asia, China, Tibet, Japan and South America where theyeventually expanded northwards to become the Mayans and other peoples of Centraland North America. They took with them the reptilian-based belief systems of Muand thus the serpent or snake became prevalent in their cultures, as with thelegends and accounts of the Hopi people in Arizona about their ‘snake brothers’,the ‘sky gods’ who they said bred with their women. Those that survived thebreak up and sinking of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean mostly went East to whatis now Europe and the Middle East (Fig 100). The Muan and Atlantean bloodlineshave since become mixed in many parts of the world as both have expanded theirterritory and influence. The Mahabharata, an ancient Sanskrit work from what isnow India and Asia and one of the major Hindu scriptures, says that a peoplecalled the Mayas (the Nagas under another name) also left India and settled inMesopotamia, Egypt and Greece. The Book of Dzyan, one of the oldest of Sanskritaccounts, tells of a reptilian race that it calls the Sarpa, or Great Dragons,that came from the skies to bring civilisation to the world. It also refers to agreat deluge that ended the Golden Age, and how the serpent gods returnedafterwards to rule human society under their leader, the ‘Great Dragon’. Worshipof the serpent gods was global and found its way into Celtic traditions inEurope in many forms, including the title, Pendragon (‘Great Dragon’, or ‘Kingof Kings’). We see this in the symbolic tales of ‘King Arthur’ who is said tohave had a dragon motif on his helmet. Arthur’s father in the stories is UtherPendragon. The Celts also worshipped the serpent god known as Hu, and Hu-man, or‘Serpent Man’, would be very appropriate given the interbreeding that created anew genetic human form. Reverend John Bathurst Deane says this of the Celts andtheir priestly class, the Druids, in his excellent 1933 work, The Worship of theSerpent:[../Images/00105.jpg]Figure 100: The relocation of surviving Muans/Lemurians and Atlanteans.> Our British ancestors, under the tuition of the venerable Druids, were not> only worshippers of the solar deity, symbolized by the serpent, but held the> serpent, independent of his relation to the sun, in peculiar veneration. Cut> off from all intercourse with the civilized world, partly by their remoteness> and partly by their national character, the Britons retained their primitive> idolatry long after it yielded in the neighbouring countries to the> polytheistic corruptions of Greece and Egypt.> In process of time, however, the gods of the Gaulish Druids penetrated into> the sacred mythology of the British and furnished personifications for the> different attributes of the draconic god Hu. This deity was called ‘The Dragon> Ruler of the World’ and his car was drawn by serpents. His priests in> accommodation with the general custom of the Ophite god, were called after him> ‘Adders’.I am only highlighting a few examples here of the global theme of reptilians orserpent gods and serpent people in the ancient world, but they are simplylegion. In China, Japan and the Far East the dragon is at the very heart of theculture and has been for thousands of years. See my books, The Biggest Secret,Children of the Matrix, The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy and HumanRace Get Off Your Knees for far more detail about the prevalence of serpentgods, worship and themes in the ancient world. No way is it a coincidence thatthe worship of the serpent is the oldest and most global of all religions.Researcher Klaus Dona who has studied endless artefacts from the far ancientworld said: ‘The snake is a very, very mystical and very often-presented object... Also the frog is a very mystical animal in old South American pre-Columbianculture, but also in Africa and also in Asia.’ Frogs turning into princes andprinces into frogs is also part of folklore and fairy tales which symbolisehuman-reptilian shapeshifting. People dismiss the existence of reptilian andother non-human entities by reflex action, without a second’s research, becausetheir minds are so set in concrete that they cannot conceive of anything beyondthe programmed ‘norm’ which they (falsely) believe is real. They also don’t wantit to be true and so they simply deny to themselves that it is. But if theywould only open their eyes, even marginally, they would realise how muchevidence there is, ancient and modern, to support what I have been saying allthese years amid such ridicule and condemnation. Tragically, those with thethickest concrete are invariably ‘journalists’, television presenters,‘scientists’, academics and all those that the masses look to when they need tobe told what to think (all the time). In this way, concrete begets concrete asbollocks begets bollocks. John Bathurst Deane said in his book The Worship ofthe Serpent that ‘the mystic serpent entered into the mythology of every nation;consecrated almost every temple; symbolised almost every deity; was imagined inthe heavens, stamped upon the earth, and ruled in the realms of everlastingsorrow’. He said the serpent was the main symbol of mythology and the ‘onlycommon object of superstitious terror throughout the habitable world’. This wasthe book’s conclusion:> It appears, then, that no nations were so geographically remote, or so> religiously discordant, but that one – and only one – superstitious> characteristic was common to all: that the most civilized and the most> barbarous bowed down with the same devotion to the same engrossing deity; and> that this deity either was, or was represented by, the same sacred serpent. It> appears also that in most, if not all, of the civilized countries where this> serpent was worshipped, some fable or tradition which involved his history,> directly or indirectly, alluded to the Fall of Man in Paradise, in which the> serpent was concerned. What follows, then, but that the most ancient account> respecting the cause and nature of this seduction must be the one from which> all the rest are derived which represent the victorious serpent – victorious> over man in a state of innocence, and subduing his soul in a state of sin,> into the most abject veneration and adoration of himself.I love the way that people in total denial of the interconnecting evidence hurlthe tag ‘conspiracy theorists’ at others when they are themselves classic‘coincidence theorists’. Somehow their terminal denial allows them to close whatpasses for their minds to the endless and ever-gathering stream of evidence overthousands of years of human enslavement right to present day which points in thesame direction. They just dismiss it with a wave of their arrogant (ignorant)hand. This applies even to most who claim to follow religions and culturalbelief systems which actually report the existence of the very predatory forcethat I have been exposing for nearly a quarter of a century. The existence of aforce manipulating and directing human society is an immensely common themeacross religions and cultures the world over. They are called different names,but they are names for the same manipulation and control in their differentforms. Just a few of them include the Archons (Gnostic); Jinn (Islam); Demons(Christianity); Flyers (Central America); Serpent gods (Far East, CentralAmerica and elsewhere); Anunnaki (Sumer); Chitauri (Zulu); Snake Brothers (Hopi)and Star People (many and various). I am not saying that these names are allreferring to exactly the same entities, but I am saying that they are referringto the same collective force which takes many expressions. There is also thecommon theme of a reptilian dictator figure, or god, as in: Apep (Egypt);Apophis (Greece); the ‘Great Dragon’ (Asia) and so many others. Elongated skullsand giant skeletons have also been found which mainstream ‘science’ cannotexplain. Remember how the Bible says: ‘There were giants in the earth in thosedays; and also after that, when the sons of God [the gods] came in unto thedaughters of men ...’ Skeletons have been found in Bolivia that are 2.6 metresin height – that’s more than eight feet to people of my age. Reptilians and manyother non-human entities are invariably described by those who have seen them asbeing extremely tall with eight feet a common estimate. Ancient societies recordthat there were once wars on Earth between ‘giants’. Elongated skulls have beenfound that can’t possibly be related to humans as we know them, because the topof the skull does not consist of the three plates of Homo sapiens. Some are muchbigger than human skulls and the teeth don’t come together in the same way. TheIca Museum in Peru is home to many of these elongated skulls and they are notlike anything that we would call human (Fig 101). Similar skulls – someestimated to be more than 4,000 years old – have been discovered all over theworld and DNA tests on some of them have apparently concluded that they are parthuman and part ‘something else’. The ‘Grey’-type ‘aliens’ are always reported tohave elongated skulls. Archaeologists from Mexico’s National Institute ofAnthropology and History also found 13 skeletons with elongated skulls in thecountry in 2012 – apparently the first find of its kind in that region. Thediscovery was made at a grave site thousands of years old 300 metres from thevillage of Onavas, southern Sonora. The suggestion is that these people weresubjected to the practice of elongating the skull starting at the earliest ageand Credo Mutwa told me that some African tribes tried to elongate the skulls oftheir children by binding them tightly from birth because they wanted them to‘look like the gods’. You can clearly see, and not coincidentally, that theancient Egyptians depicted their pharaohs and royal families with elongatedheads – as here with the Pharaoh Akhenaton and his wife, Nefertiti (Figs 102 and103). They were said to be the bloodlines of the gods and this fits perfectlywith where I am going in later chapters.[../Images/00496.jpg]Figure 101: The elongated skulls at the Ica Museum in Peru.[../Images/00076.jpg]Figure 102: The Pharaoh Akhenaton.[../Images/00211.jpg]Figure 103: Nefertiti.The ArchonsI have been on this road of research and discovery for more than a third of mylife and so many times over these years I have come across ancient or historicalaccounts that have supported the information that I have put together frompresent day sources and experiences. Some of the most telling examples are thetexts of the diverse groups that come under the heading of ‘Gnosticism’(‘knowledge’) and are collectively known as ‘Gnostics’ (‘learned’). The term‘knowledge’ has a far wider meaning to Gnostics than mere intellectual facts andfigures. It refers to a deep insight and awareness of existence beyond theintellect and the material world in general. Knowledge to the Gnostics wasspiritual in context rather than merely intellectual. Gnostics referred to whatI call Body-Mind as nous and made a clear distinction between that and pneuma,the eternal spirit that I call Consciousness or Awareness. They had a verydifferent and far more accurate view of Judeo-Christianity which I will explainmore about when I discuss the major role of religion in adding to the world’sceaseless supply of that which rhymes with rollocks. In short, Gnostics saidthat the way to escape illusory reality was through self-realisation securedwith Gnosis, or hidden spiritual knowledge. They often paid for their beliefs insuppression and slaughter. ‘The system’, which includes the religions, did notwant them spreading their version of reality which originated in the mostancient of Mystery Schools where advanced knowledge was communicated toinitiates. Most were later hijacked to become the global secret society networkwhich exploits the same knowledge, but with a very different intent. MysterySchool/Gnostic awareness of reality also came from the use of psychoactivepotions which opened the channels to ‘out there’ where insight came from directexperience of realms beyond the ‘physical’. Gnostics talked about the Bythos, or‘Void’, the ‘primal ground’ that existed before our world was created. TheBythos is what I call All Possibility, the All That Is. One of the best-knownGnostics was Hypatia (350-415AD), the mathematician and philosopher who ran theRoyal Library of Alexandria (widely known the Great Library) in Roman-controlledEgypt (Fig 104). Others connected with the library included Erastosthenes, whoaccurately measured the size of the Earth, and Aristarchus who revealed thesun-centred nature of the solar system nearly 2,000 years before Copernicus.What a different world we would live in today if this knowledge stream had beenallowed to continue, flourish and expand. Hypatia was born in Athens and wassteeped in the ancient Greek knowledge and philosophy of Aristotle, Plato (whowrote about the demise of Atlantis) and Socrates who is credited with thebrilliant observation that ‘wisdom is knowing how little we know’. Hypatia was aGnostic in the widest sense and the Great Library was a treasure trove ofancient esoteric knowledge that the Roman Church itself was founded upon becauseit was merely the Church of Babylon relocated to Rome. What the Church of Rome(Babylon) claims to publically believe is just a cover story to hide its truenature and true intent. I will expand on this later. The last thing the ControlSystem and its centrally-important Roman Church wanted was for the generalpopulation to know any truth about reality – that was only for the inner circleof the Church. The Great Library was therefore sacked and burned and itscontents destroyed. Hypatia was murdered by a mob, an act instigated by Cyril,Patriarch of Alexandria, who was later made a ‘saint’ by the Church. Hypatia waspulled from her chariot and her body hacked into pieces before being set onfire. This was justified by accusations of witchcraft, godlessness and causingreligious turmoil (telling people what the Church did not want them to know).Hacking a woman to pieces and burning the remains is ‘godly’, is it? Thesepeople are insane and they still exist in shocking numbers today. The GreatLibrary of Alexandria was home to some half a million scrolls, texts anddocuments from the ancient world containing deep esoteric understandings and aversion of human history that the Control System is desperate for people not toknow. What wasn’t directly destroyed ended up in the vaults of the Vatican whereit will still be today. Another example of the Church’s hatred (see fear) of theGnostics was the slaughter of the Cathars in southern France. The Catharsflourished in the Languedoc region, as well as in other parts of Europe, betweenthe 11th and 13th centuries until those that controlled the Church said enoughwas enough. The far more expanded awareness of the Cathars was threatening theomnipotence of Papal lies and something had to be done. Enter the Inquisitionand the means through which anyone who was even questioning Christian orthodoxywas horrifically killed. Once the Inquisition turned its evil sights on theCathars the outcome was assured. The end came at the siege in 1244 at Montsegur,a castle in the foothills of the Pyrenees, which I visited many years ago (Fig105). It is estimated that up to 200 Cathars were burned alive for refusing todenounce their beliefs. There have been rumours ever since that some escapedwith the Cathar ‘treasure’. This is speculated to have been either wealth or,far more likely, knowledge (real wealth). The common theme through the centurieshas been that Gnostics = send the boys in and destroy them and any record ofwhat they knew or believed. I am not saying for a second that they kneweverything about reality, of course not, but they knew more than enough for theChurch to greatly fear them – and certainly more than mainstream religion orscience knows still today except for the inner core that connects with theglobal secret society network.[../Images/00403.jpg]Figure 104: A painting of Hypatia.[../Images/00362.jpg]Figure 105: Montsegur where the Cathars officially met their demise in 1244.The find of findsThe good news, and we need some in this story of Gnostic suppression, is that in1945 a collection of Gnostic texts were discovered by a local peasant at NagHammadi in Egypt, a town on the banks of the River Nile some 77 miles fromLuxor. They had been bound in leather and buried in a sealed jar. The papyrusused to thicken the leather bindings appears to date from around 350 to 400AD,but it is widely believed that the original texts are older – perhaps dated toaround 100AD. This was before the destruction of the Great Library in Alexandriaand the brutal murder of Hypatia and even then the knowledge stream that thetexts represent goes back way beyond Anno Domini into pre-history. The texts arethe work of the ‘Pagan’ Gnostics, not the later Christian Gnostics. The jarcontained 13 codices and more than 50 texts which have given us far greaterinsight into what the Gnostics knew and believed and when I read translations oftheir content it was immediately clear that they were mightily relevant to myown research and conclusions about a hidden force manipulating and directinghuman affairs. One fifth of the texts found at Nag Hammadi focus on non-humanmanipulators that they call the ‘Archons’ which infiltrate the human mind toinfluence and direct perception of reality. This is precisely what I have beensaying all these years about the fact that the manipulators of human society arenot so much ‘extraterrestrial’ in the accepted sense (though the word only meansnot of the Earth). I have always preferred to call them ‘interdimensionals’because they operate largely unseen by humans in a frequency band beyond visiblelight and the realm of our electromagnetic field. They can come into our world,but not for long because of the vibrational incompatibility and the nature ofour atmosphere. You can compare it with someone being sent into a place of highradiation but having to withdraw after a specific time before they sufferedconsequences. I have said that this force takes a reptilian form, but not onlyso, and the Nag Hammadi Gnostic texts refer to reptilian entities and thoseknown today as the classic ‘Grey aliens’ as expressions of these Archons. TheGreys are described in the texts as like an unformed baby or foetus with greyskin and dark, unmoving eyes (106 and 107). Remember that this was written thebest part of 2,000 years before modern reports began to appear of activity andsightings of Reptilians and Greys. Images and descriptions of non- humanentities – some very tall and other very small – and of advanced craft andtechnology can be found in cave paintings and accounts throughout the ancientworld because what is happening today was happening then (Fig 108 and 109). TheGreys can be tall or as small as three to four feet according to the now verylarge number of people worldwide who claim to have been abducted by them. Theshort ones are almost certainly the origin of Irish folklore about ‘the littlepeople’. Abductees speak of undergoing excruciatingly painful medical ‘tests’,having sperm taken, in the case of males, or impregnated in the case of women toproduce hybrid babies. Credo Mutwa, now in his 90s, told me when I first met himin the late 1990s that he had examined Greys that had been found dead in theAfrican bush. He said the grey exterior and large black eyes are actually a‘suit’ of some kind that is incredibly difficult to penetrate. He said that onlythe sharpest axe will break through and inside he said there is a reptilian-typecreature. This would make sense with them needing protection from the Earthvibration and atmosphere. Credo also told me about this own abduction experiencewith the Greys and you will find these stories in the more than six hours ofinterviews that I did with him many years ago under the title The ReptilianAgenda. You can watch this for free on my website in the section appropriatelycalled Reptilian Agenda. Members of this Grey species are claimed to have beenin the famous ‘alien spaceship’ that is said to have crashed near Roswell, NewMexico in 1947 and yet the Gnostics were writing about them 2,000 years ago.Those Gnostic texts are supported by other accounts thousands of years oldaround the world and by cave paintings and other depictions. The ‘ant people’described by the Hopi tribe in Arizona is a perfect description of the Greys. Iwill refer from this point to this collective of reptilians, Greys and otherforms working for human suppression and control as the Archons to keep it niceand simple. I am using the term to describe all their multiple forms andexpressions although reptilians and Greys are certainly two of the major ones. Apoint to emphasise here is that these entities and energies have beenmanipulating human affairs for aeons and only the names they have been given indifferent cultures through the ages have changed. The prime method of control isthrough the infiltration and possession of the human mind with the aim ofmanipulating and programming individual and collective perception. Thetranslated Nag Hammadi text called The Apocryphon of John II says of theArchons:[../Images/00155.jpg]Figure 106 and 107: The Gnostics described both the Reptilians and ‘Greys’ ofmodern ‘UFO’ research in texts thousands of years ago. They called themcollectively ‘Archons’.> [../Images/00255.jpg]> Figure 108 and 109: Many and various ancient depictions of flying craft and> non-human entities from all over the world.> They sought to overpower humanity in its psychological and perceptual> functions ... although they saw that human thinking was superior to theirs ...> For indeed their delight is bitter and their beauty is depraved. And their> triumph is in deception leading astray, for their own structure is without> divinity.As I go on to detail the Archon mentality and methodology it is going to make somuch sense of human society, perception and behaviour. The name ‘Archon’ derivesfrom the Greek term archaia, which means ‘from the beginning’ and Archon wasalso used by the Greeks as a term for ‘prince’ or ‘ruler’. Archon isappropriately derived from the same root as monarch and hierarchy and we alsohave archbishops, Royal Arch Freemasons (one of the most significant Freemasonicgroupings) and other uses of the term.The manifest distortionThe Gnostic texts say that the Archons serve the ‘Demiurge’, a fake ‘god’ thatcreated our ‘physical’ or material reality as we perceive it. The Demiurge isalso known in the Gnostic texts as the ‘Lord Archon’ and they quote him assaying: ‘Come let us create a man according to the image of God and according toour likeness.’ The Hebrew Saturn god El and his Biblical Elohim are the GnosticLord Archon/Demiurge and Archons under another name. They were depicted in apainting in 1795 by English artist and writer, William Blake, who appears tohave been very influenced by Gnostic thought. The painting is called Elohimcreating Adam and the snake symbolism is heavily involved as usual (Fig 110).Blake had to be subtle and not too blatant given the domination of Christianityat the time. The Gnostics turned biblical belief on its head and equated the godof the Old Testament with the Demiurge/Satan/Devil and this makes far more senseof the Judeo-Christian Yahweh/Jehovah, the ‘god’ whose mass murder and threatsof mass murder pervade the biblical narrative. Yahweh comes from Yah (god) andHovah (wickedness and associated descriptions). They picked the right name,then. Yaldabaoth was another name for the Satan-like ‘god’ which Gnosticsassociated with the Demiurge and it means ‘one who traverses the external space’(and constantly seeks to infiltrate our internal space). Other Gnostic schoolsassociated the Demiurge with Satan, Ahriman, Saklas, Samael and Choronzon.Gnostics said that the Demiurge was behind the creation of ‘Adam’, or AdamKadmon (‘Primal Man’) and this fits with my long-held contention that the forcereferred to here as the Archons manipulated human genetics to create a body-type(biological computer-type) that most suited their goal of human subjugation.Adam was known to the Gnostics as ‘Anthropos’, the first human being, but Iwould say more like the first human form from the new genetic type. You can seehow exposing the true the nature of the Judeo-Christian god Jehovah/Yahweh madethe Roman Church so determined to destroy the Gnostics and their writings, butwhat is the ‘Demiurge’, exactly? An entity, a ‘spirit’, an extraterrestrial? Iwould describe the Demiurge in one word ... a distortion – and I mean literally.Everything is energy/Consciousness/Awareness and when you have harmonious energythis manifests harmony in Consciousness/Awareness and, from that, harmony inbehaviour and perception. When you have an energetic distortion the opposite isthe case – distorted energy, Awareness, perceptions, attitudes and behaviour.Something happened which created this distortion and the distortion became aperception and Awareness because everything is aware in some form. Thedistortion became self-aware. This distortion – being a distortion – saw itselfand all it surveyed from a crooked, flawed and misguided perception of reality.It believed that only it existed because the distortion prevented a connectionwith – and so an awareness of – higher and more expanded states ofConsciousness. The distortion or Demiurge believed it was the Creator or ‘God’.The Gnostics described the Demiurge as ‘demented’ and this is why. The termdemented is defined as ‘crazy, unhinged, unbalanced, mad, sick, disturbed andinsane’. The key word among them is unbalanced the opposite of balance andharmony ... a distortion. The Archons which were created by the Demiurgeaccording to Gnostic texts are copies of the original distortion with the samedementia and perceptions. I am seeing the scene in my mind as I am writing thisof the Disney animation, the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, as a broom carrying bucketsof water for trainee magician Mickey Mouse divides into copies of itself andcreates ever more chaos. To enslave and control humanity the Demiurge andArchons had only one option given the potential of humans to connect withawareness far beyond the Archontic realm. They had to transmit their distortionto humanity and bring them down to the same level of ignorance and limitation –in fact lower. This they have overwhelmingly done and when people talk aboutliving their life to the full they are most often saying that they are livingtheir distortion to the full. This distortion of reality equates more money, bighouse, big car and lots and lots to eat and drink to ‘living life to the full’,as if these are the definition of ‘living’.[../Images/00477.jpg]Figure 110: Elohim creating Adam by William Blake. © Tate BritainThe DeceiversThe Nag Hammadi texts describe how the Demiurge is served by the Archons –entities operating as mind-parasites (possessors of human perception) with amodus operandi encapsulated in a single word: deception. So often the Reptiliansand associated forces are described in ancient cultures in similar terms. Thisis why the entire Control System within human reality is founded on deceit –politicians, bankers, ‘journalists’ and their like are so often professionalliars because they are expressions of the Archontic deception which is based onlies and distortions of truth. Gnostics saw the Archons as counterfeit spiritsexploiting the technique of ‘counter-mimicry’ in which they copy something thatalready exists and then give it a twist to make it produce a differentconsequence or outcome. Gnostic texts refer to this as phantasia. In short, theDemiurge and Archons invert everything and so do Satanists who serve and worshipthe Demiurge-Archons/Reptilians. Satanists use the inverted five-pointed star,or pentagram, as their prime symbol (Fig 111). They also invert the cross whichoriginated many thousands of years before it was adopted by Christianity. Thisis not, as portrayed, an attack on Christianity which is just anotherprison-religion established to serve the Archontic Control System. The cross isinverted because Satanists invert everything just like the Demiurge and theArchon-Reptilians. The Archon-inspired and controlled Nazis took the benignancient symbol of the swastika (which can be found profusely in Japanesetemples) and turned it around to become their symbol for mass murder and masscontrol (Figs 112 and 113). The Archons invert everything? Remember that quotefrom earlier by Michael Ellner:[../Images/00444.jpg]Figure 111: Satanism’s inverted five-pointed star, or pentagram.[../Images/00190.jpg]Figure 112 and 113: The swastika symbol on Japanese temples and the Naziversion.> Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, psychiatrists destroy minds,> scientists destroy truth, major media destroys information, religions destroy> spirituality and governments destroy freedom.This is in fact describing a human society infiltrated and directed by thehidden Archontic agenda for human control and exploitation which involves thedeception of perception by these professional parasites of both the human mindand human energy. John Lamb Lash writes in his book about the Gnostics, Not InHis Image:> In the Gnostic perspective the Archons are not only mind parasites –> delusional nodes in the human mind, considered as quasi-autonomous psychic> entities, if you will – they are cosmic imposters, parasites who pose as gods.> But they lack the primary divine factor of ennoia, ‘intentionality’, ‘creative> will’. They cannot originate anything, they can only imitate, and they must> effectuate their copycat activity with subterfuge and stealth, lest its true> nature be detected.This is why we live in a parasite society at all levels, from governments andbanks parasitizing off humanity collectively to people parasitizing off eachother and even parasites feeding internally off the human body. Parasites areeverywhere in the parasite society of the Archon parasites. I have had parasiticpeople in my own life who arrogantly assumed the right to take the rewards ofanother’s talents and efforts while contributing nothing. Look at theArchon-possessed people that run the global political and banking system and theroyal families and their ‘divine’ (Archon) right to rule. They are parasitesfeeding off the talents and efforts of the global population. You can see whythis is so once you realise that they are Archons taking human form. Thedefinition of parasite encapsulates the way that such people operate and, mostrelevantly to this book, how the Archons parasite off humanity:> Parasite: An organism that grows, feeds and is sheltered on or in a different> organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host; one who> habitually takes advantage of the generosity of others without making any> useful return.This is the Archon mentality for sure and they are constantly encouraging humansinto errors and distorted perceptions which they can then further perpetuate,expand and make permanent unless the victim reaches some level ofself-realisation by becoming Conscious beyond Body-Mind.Demons and JinnI will have a lot more to say about the Archons and the Gnostic texts as weproceed, but at this point it is worth comparing what the Gnostics say about theArchons with what Arabian legends and stories and the Islamic holy book, theKoran, say about ‘supernatural entities which they call the ‘Jinn’, also speltDjinn. The name comes from an Arabic root word meaning ‘to hide’ or ‘hidden’.Jinn are described as occupying a parallel world (frequency band) to humans andare usually invisible to us (exactly what the Gnostics say about the Archons andI have long said about the Reptilians). Other Jinn derivatives include wordsthat mean madness and embryo or foetus, as in hidden inside the mind and hiddeninside the womb. From Jinn also comes ‘genie’ – the magical beings that could beheld in a bottle as energy and then manifest in human-type form when released.This is symbolising a major truth in that the Archons are simplyenergy/awareness in their base state, but they can manifest or project an‘outer’ form when they need to. This is possible because there is no ‘physical’and everything that appears to be a solid form is actually decoded energy – adecoded field of information. The projector of the ‘form’ is the source only ofthe information field. It is the observer, the decoder, who actually creates theillusory form that they think they see by the act of observation/decoding. Theapparently crazy and impossible becomes perfectly straightforward once yourealise this. The Koran says that the Jinn are made of ‘smokeless fire’ and theArchons are said by the Gnostics to be made from ‘luminous fire’. One of themajor symbols of the Control System to this day is the flame or torch, anddemonic entities often enter satanic rituals through the medium of fire –symbolised by the fire genie bursting from the lamp (Fig 114). There are manyancient references to moving between realities through the conduit of fire.Legends say that when a Jinn known as ʾIblīs disobeyed Allah he was expelledfrom Paradise with the name ‘Šayṭān’ – Satan. ʾIblīs, the Islamic Devil, is saidto have no power directly, but can only ‘cast evil suggestions into the heart ofmen, women, and Jinn’. This what the Gnostics say about the Archons. ManyMuslims wear a talisban, or taweez, for protection against the Jinn, as didNative American tribes and others for protection against their version of thisunseen manipulating force. The Jinn are said to be organised in socialhierarchies and three such class divisions are ‘those who have wings and fly inthe air; those who resemble snakes and dogs; and those who travel aboutceaselessly’. We see dog-headed gods depicted in ancient Egypt and they havebeen explained as symbolic of Sirius, the so-called Dog Star, but who knows?Legends say that Jinn can also appear as dragons and can take human form whennecessary to engage in their deceit. Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328), the renownedIslamic scholar, described the Jinn as ‘ignorant, untruthful, oppressive andtreacherous’, although common Islamic belief is that they can have variousstates of being. He said that the Jinn engage in manipulative ‘magic’ andorchestrate events and misinformation at séances. The Koran connects the Jinn toKing Solomon, the major hero of the Jewish belief system: ‘And before Solomonwere marshalled his hosts, of Jinn and men and birds, and they were all kept inorder and ranks’ (Quran 27:17). The Archons described by the Gnostics and theJinn of Islamic and pre-Islamic Arabia are portrayed in the same terms and sothey should be because they are the same. Central American shamans also refer toshadowy entities that they call the Flyers – once again the description andmodus operandi are the same as the Jinn and the Archons.[../Images/00016.jpg]Figure 114: The Jinn ‘made from fire’ are the origin of the genie legends.Jinn also appear in Arabic translations of the Bible, but generally theChristian ‘Jinn’ are known as demons or demonic. A demon is yet again said to bea supernatural being, often malevolent, which can possess human beings andanimals, take over their perception and behaviour, and cause them ill-health.The Christian demons are the Archons and Jinn under another name, that’s all.The ‘casting out of demons’ is very much a Biblical theme and demons areassociated with the concept of ‘fallen angels’. The Roman Catholic Churchemploys designated exorcists to this day to remove demons from people, which isironic, really, because it has spent thousands of years in its variousincarnations putting them in. The demons of Hebrew lore are called the Se’irimand the Shedim, which apparently comes from a root word meaning ‘to damage’.Here we go again ... they were said to possess human beings and even inanimateobjects. They can do this because the Archons/Jinn/Demons/Shedim are pure energyin their prime form and so can attach themselves to any other type of energy orelectromagnetic field, be it the human auric field or the waveform andnon-holographic levels of apparently inanimate objects. I was in a horriblehouse in Arizona once which clearly, from my experience of Satanic rituallocations over the years, had been used for some real ‘dark’ stuff. Around thewalls were ritual masks. As I looked at them for a while it was clear to me thatthey were ‘possessed’ by a very malevolent energy and acted as interdimensionalenergetic ‘doorways’ through which the ‘demons’ could slip through during therituals. Anyone that takes part in these rituals or has sex with those that dowill almost certainly be possessed by the Archontic force. The rituals createenergy fields specifically designed to allow the Archons/Jinn/demons to attachthemselves to the auric fields of the participants and when two energy fieldsbecome merged during sexual activity an Archon demon or demons possessing oneperson can have the opportunity to attach to the other. The man at the house inArizona was certainly possessed in my view. Masks have many connotations withregard to all of this and among them is the symbolism of possession and ofputting one face to the world while a very different one hides behind thepersonality that you think you see. Today’s Satanism is the worship of theseentities which Satanists allow to possess them. The Satanic hierarchy in ourreality is dictated by the power and status of the Archon demons that possessthe people involved and so the Archon/Jinn/demon/Shedim hierarchy in theirreality becomes the Satanic hierarchy in ours – the hierarchy that controlsroyalty, politics, banking, corporations, the media and so on. Make sense of theworld? Some Hebrew sources believe that the demons are subordinate to a leaderknown variously as Asmodai, Haggadah and Samael (‘the angel of death’). Thiscorresponds with the Gnostic concept of the Demiurge. Over and over we find thesame common themes.I suggest that what are called the Anunnaki, Chitauri, etc., are expressions inapparent ‘solid’ form of the energetic Archons/Jinn/demons. Not allextraterrestrial/interdimensional entities have a malevolent agenda for humanity– far, far from it – but these do. Stewart Swerdlow, the American author andresearcher, was held captive for many years in a US Military/Intelligence mindcontrol and genetics programme at Montauk on Long Island, New York. Thebackground to this terrible place and Stewart’s experiences there can be seen inthe documentary, Montauk Chronicles, released in 2012. Stewart says that he haddirect experience with reptilian beings at Montauk and learned about theiragenda for the world. He said that reptilian humanoids ‘seemed to pop in and outof physical reality’ (came in and out of our frequency band of visible light).But this is the point to make here, as I have in previous books. The reptiliansand their associates are not at the top of the hierarchy of human control; theyare vehicles or expressions in holographic form of the energetic Archons.Stewart Swerdlow says that he learned at Montauk how the Reptilians were createdby the ‘transparent people’ – entities that ‘cannot really enter into thephysical dimensions because their energy vibratory rate is so high that itcannot sustain a physical body’. He says that when they do manifest here theylook like ‘a transparent glass shell’. I say that these are what the Gnosticscalled the Archons and others call the Jinn, demons and many other names. Their‘high’ vibration does not mean that they are spiritually advanced. They wouldn’tdo what they do if they were. The term ‘high’ is relative to the very lowvibration necessary to interact with our reality in its current energetic state.The Archons overcome the frequency disparity by the possession of human mindsand thus body-computers operating within the frequency band of visible light.The Archons directly possess humans who are open to possession, knowingly orunknowingly, while Archontic expressions like the Reptilians and Greys directhuman society through a network of particular hybrid-bloodline families whichlook human, but aren’t. These families are the ones that today control theapparently human governments, banking system, corporations, media, education,science and the rest of the power structure that dictates the lives – ever morecallously and brutally – of humankind. A friend told me of an associate who hadbeen working on iris scanning technology that involved looking closely into2,300 eyes and he said that he had been shocked to find in his words that aroundfour percent appeared to be ‘of reptilian type and appearance’. I have said overthe years that I felt that the reptilian-hybrids within human society wouldnumber around five percent of the population although the number possessed bythese entities is far, far higher.Extraordinary, incredible and hard to believe? Sure, of course it is from theperspective of programmed human perception, but it’s true all the same and it islong past the time when we faced it. Then, and only then, can we effectivelydeal with what is happening; and we can deal with it. Humans have the power, notthe Archons, which is why they have to work covertly and with stealth. They areterrified that the truth will be known, because they know that the game is overonce humanity stops giving its power away to that which manipulates from theshadows via the leading politicians, bankers, business people, media owners andall the rest.It is all a mind game which this book will expose in great detail."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00167.jpg]How they keep us in this Bollocks– The MatrixLife is pretty simple: You do some stuff.

Leonardo da VinciThe Gnostics said that the Demiurge (‘Devil/Satan’) and the Archons cannotdirectly create anything because they lack what the Gnostics call ‘ennoia’ –‘creative will’ and ‘intentionality’ (creative intent changes reality). I wouldalso put it this way: they do not have the gift of creative imagination and sothey must manipulate and exploit those who do if they are to get what they want.Creation is the holographic manifestation of imagination which is an expressionof Consciousness, not Body-Mind. Artists and many writers have creativeimagination, for example, and so they can create something unique and originalfrom a blank canvas or piece of paper. People in the ‘box’ cannot do this –which is why they are in the ‘box’. What you cannot imagine, you cannot create.You can only follow, copy or twist what has already been imagined and created.So it is with the Archons and their representatives in our reality who I will bedescribing in detail. Gnostic texts say that this inability for originalcreation means that the Demiurge and the Archons must use deception to twist andmanipulate (invert) what is already created. This theme is the origin of manyso-called ‘trickster gods’ around the world. This doesn’t mean that they can’t‘make’ anything – their reptilian expressions are obsessed with technologybecause it overcomes some of the limitations on their creative imagination. Itmeans that they can’t create from a blank sheet of paper. They have to‘piggy-back’ on what is already known and in existence. In a sentence, they lackthe gift of creative imagination which requires a much more expandedConsciousness/Awareness and so they must hijack what has already been imaginedinto form – in this case human society. Now, here is a biggy that I will developlater: Humans do potentially have creative imagination and the Archonsmanipulate human perception so that we create (imagine into holographicexistence) the world that suits them. They have to trick us into creating ourown collective prison – and they have. The Demiurge and the Archons areprofessional hijackers and they have long hijacked the Earth and the perceptionsof its inhabitants. Many things come from this. I have been pointing out formany years that the Reptilians are extremely robotic and mechanical in theirthinking and structure (dominated by intellect and no creative imagination). TheGnostics referred to the Archons in similar terms because they are one and thesame. Archon-Reptilian society is incredibly and genetically hierarchical andeveryone knows their place. Stewart Swerdlow says that he learned while in theMontauk mind control project on Long Island, New York, that the similarlyhierarchical Indian caste system was taken directly from the structure of socialorganisation of the ‘serpent gods’. This has also been transferred to much ofhuman society which, while not usually as extreme as a caste system, isstructured as a topdown, know-your-place hierarchy of power – or lack of power –distribution. This is becoming more extreme by the day as their plan moves on tocentralise power in fewer and fewer hands. What the Gnostics said about theArchons and their need to deceive and hijack rather than create from scratchabsolutely fits with my contention for so long now that humanity is entrapped ina fake reality – a ‘Matrix’ world which has been hacked into what was alreadythere. I was taken aback reading about the Gnostic material since my last bookto see just how it mirrors in so many ways the story that has been unfolding inmy research all over the world since 1990. Nag Hammadi texts say that ‘the worldwe inhabit came about due to a mistake’ and Gnostics said that our illusoryreality came from the ‘generation of error’. This ‘error’ is what created thedistortion without creative imagination that they called the Demiurge.Interestingly, New Agers and others talk of the ‘Earth plane’ and otherinvisible ‘planes’ of reality, but the word plane, which comes from the Greek,was defined as ‘error’ or ‘going astray’. Gnostic writings say that theDemiurge/Archons created the inorganic parts of the solar system by making a badcopy of the original. You could think of it as a flawed download. I would put itthis way in the modern context: they hacked in to the original virtual realityuniverse (which still exists) and they have been feeding the information fieldsof this hack to the human decoding system for us to manifest the holographicworld of the ‘bad copy’ hack as our experienced and believed-in reality. Thishack is what I will call ‘The Matrix’. I was amazed to see that Gnostic textsrefer to this as ‘Hal’, or ‘simulation’, and what we would call today a virtualreality world, given what I have written about this for so many years. John LambLash writes in Not In His Image:> Although they cannot originate anything, because they lack the divine factor> of ennoia (intentionality), Archons can imitate with a vengeance. Their> expertise is simulation (HAL, virtual reality). The Demiurge fashions a heaven> world copied from the fractal patterns of the eternal Aeons, the Pleromic gods> who reside in the galactic centre. His construction is celestial kitsch, like> the fake Italianate villa of a Mafia don complete with militant angels to> guard every portal.Gnostics defined the Pleroma, as in Pleromic gods, as existence beyond matter. Irelate the term to what I call the Metaphysical Universe – the waveform leveland beyond. The download may have been a bad copy, but it was still a copy ofsomething good and they have been working ever since to remove the good andreplace it with their own reality. Later in the book when I put all this in thecontext of current events you will see how what is happening is turning ourworld into the Archon world.Changing the MovieEntrapping human perception in a fake ‘hack’ reality is one thing, but there isthe constant potential for humans to awaken to so far beyond the Body-Mindcaught in the Matrix that they are able to see what is happening and alertothers to this extraordinary fact. They couldn’t just install the Matrix ‘copy’in the way that I will describe and then sit back. The manipulation is ongoingand the plan is to control human perception ever more completely to ensure thatno one would be able to wake up to what is going on. The transhumanist agenda tocross the human body with technology is all part of this, as I shall beexplaining. Gnostics described the Archons as inorganic and as what we wouldterm in today’s language, cyborgs. Transhumanism wants to see the cyborg human –part-human part-technology – and its advocates are articulating the next stageof the Archon takeover of the human Body-Mind: to make humans even more likethem. The cataclysmic upheavals in the solar system were fundamentally connectedto the Hack. The Demiurge/Archons technologically-instigated a colossaldistortion in the waveform information fabric of our reality (what I call the‘Schism’) and given that the Archons control the information field of the Hackor Matrix this is nothing like as difficult as it may sound. It is the same intheme as re-writing a computer program to bring about a different outcome on thescreen. If you distort and disharmonise the waveform level of reality then thiswill be decoded as electrical, digital and holographic distortions which, in theholographic ‘physical’ realm, will manifest as world-changing geologicalupheavals. This could easily include the Earth moving on its axis (hence its‘wobble’) which itself would generate a gigantic global tsunami – the universal‘Great Flood’ (Fig 115). If the waveform distortion was big enough and deepenough it would so distort the energetic balance of the wider solar system thatplanets (and dwarf stars like Saturn and Jupiter) would dramatically changelocations. This would support the work of Immanuel Velikovsky and those who havecontinued and expanded his research. This is a vital, vital, point to getacross. Creation, and the distortion and hijacking of creation, does not happenin the holographic or illusory-physical realm. This is merely like a screen onwhich the movie plays out as a done deal. Once a movie hits the cinema screenthere is no changing it and the same with holographic reality. If you want tochange the experience of the holographic realm, or what we optimistically callthe conscious mind, then you have to make the change in what we call the‘sub-conscious’ or waveform level – the Metaphysical Universe . It is from herethat the Archons manipulate events in the holographic realm and this makes somuch explainable which would otherwise seem impossible if you were thinking onlyin terms of the non-existent ‘physical’.I’ll give you a quick example of what I mean, part of a story that I will expandon later. When I returned to Peru in April, 2012, I saw a big rock formation ata particularly relevant location to the Archons. You could immediately see thatthe formation looked like a dragon or dinosaur (Fig 116). The pictures here onlygive you a feel for the dragon rock and they can’t capture how blatant it iswhen you see it ‘live’. There is a large head at one end followed by the backand the tail with another head at the tail making it a double dragon (Figs 117and 118). The only way to explain this if you start from the perspective of‘physical’ reality is that the wind and rain must somehow have miraculously wornaway the rocks to form an extraordinary accident of nature; but no accident isnecessary when you realise how the universe and the Matrix Hack is reallystructured. An information field encoded with the dragon rock formation isinserted at the waveform level (akin to what computer programmers do) and whenthis encoded information is decoded into holographic reality, hey presto:‘Blimey, that looks just like a dragon’. To have a dragon rock formation at alocation connected to the Archon-reptilians (as I will explain later) is not acoincidence. The rock was made to be that way and you can do this if you encodethe waveform information construct. This is why mainstream ‘science’ can’texplain even the fundamentals about our reality. It is scanning the movie screenfor answers while ignoring the projector and the Archontic computer programmers.All this means that information fields can be encoded with historical ‘finds’that are not from the non-existent ‘past’, but encoded in the NOW to manipulatehuman perception of reality and ‘history’. Talk about needing to be on our toesand constantly alert to all possibility.[../Images/00343.jpg]Figure 115: A rift in the waveform information construct played through intoholographic global disaster.[../Images/00429.jpg]Figure 116: Dinosaur rock in Peru[../Images/00098.jpg]Figure 117 and 118: The double-dragon.The engineered cataclysms brought an end to the Golden Age ‘Avatar’ society anda very different one was to take its place. The collective energy field of thesolar system went from relative harmony to extreme distortion – the Schism.Astronomically and so astrologically everything had changed. At least Saturn,Venus, Mars and Jupiter were now in very different locations and this meant thatthey were interacting with the energy field in a different way to before. This,in turn, influenced humans in a different way as they interacted with the muchtransformed collective field through what we call astrological connections. Thedistortion of the field had fundamental effects in terms of suppressing humanawareness through the imbalances that ensued. Not that there were many Earthpeople left after all this came to pass, but what few there were became theblueprint from which a new human would be manipulated – one literally bred forslavery. The new ‘genetic’ (information field) human Body-Mind was not createdfrom scratch, but in true Archontic fashion the original was changed, distortedand rewired. All the global stories in their different forms about Adam and Eveand the serpent in the Garden of Eden and the Noah character saving selectedhumans and two of every animal (genetic material) are all related to this theme.So, most certainly, is the biblical story of the sons of God (the gods)interbreeding with the daughters of men to create the Nephilim, a hybrid racealso known as the Emim, Anakim and Rephiam. They were a race of giants recordedin cave paintings and ancient texts the world over and the Bible says: ‘Therewere giants in the earth in those days.’ These hybrids were known as the‘demigods’, part human, part ‘god’. Gilgamesh from the Sumerian king list was agood example. He is the main character in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which isdescribed as ‘the greatest surviving work of early Mesopotamian literature’.Gilgamesh is described as a demigod of superhuman strength who survived theGreat Deluge and was twothirds ‘god’ and one third human. The Nephilim hybridsare still controlling human society today, as we shall see, although they nolonger appear as they once did. Legends and accounts in almost every culturerefer to the interbreeding between humans and the ‘gods’ and the manipulation ofhuman genetics. It is a global theme. The Sumerian Tablets tell this story aboutthe Anunnaki, as do Zulu shamans and others throughout Africa with regard to thevarious versions of the Chitauri. The Hopi people in the United States tell oftheir ‘snake brothers’ who interbred with their women and they were widely knownaround the world as ‘the Watchers’. Shinar, the biblical name for Sumer, means‘The Land of the Watchers’. It was known by the Egyptians as Ta Neter, whichmeant the same.Shadow People and the world beneath our feetThe Archons cannot manifest, at least for long, in our reality because of thefrequency difference and atmospheric incompatibility. They can appear for ashort time in many guises and disguises through the projection of holographicfields and they are the socalled ‘Men-in-Black’ who have been experienced bymany in the field of UFO research. They look strange, act strange and then oftendisappear in ways that cannot be explained in terms of leaving by foot orvehicle. The ‘Shadow People’ described in many cultures also fit the Archonmethod of operation and so do those that Central American shaman call theFlyers. The Shadow People have been described as having no faces, but somehowstill managing to give the impression of staring. They communicate informationdirectly into the mind of the observer and bypass the usual five-sense decodingprocess. I have been ‘visited’ by something very similar in my bedroom at nightand they are always accompanied by intense electromagnetic activity. Sometimes Iwill be woken by a loud buzz or see electromagnetic phenomena and on thesenights I always experience vivid dreams. This used to keep me awake when itstarted some years ago, but now I just give it the finger and turn over. Myfather used to talk about some people being ‘all mouth and trousers’ and that’show I see these entities. Their power over us is only our perception of theirpower over us. They’re little boys in short pants really. The Archons overcometheir inability to stay in our reality for long by using robot-type beings(expressions of themselves) for most of the interaction. These are theReptilians and associated non-human entities like the Greys. The Archons canmanifest in many forms, too, including reptilian, to confuse and misdirect, butonly in short bursts because it takes so much energy to do this when it is notyour natural frequency. The power centre of the Archon-Reptilians is also beyondour frequency band, but they can manifest here for a longer and there are otherReptilian types that operate within our frequency band if they avoid the surfacesunlight (hence the story of the vampire Dracula who had to be back in hiscoffin by sunrise). These types of Reptilian are located within the Earth inunderground cities. Many took shelter deep underground at the time of the lastglobal cataclysm along with other ‘extraterrestrial’ races including ablond-haired, blue- eyed group known by UFO researchers as the ‘Nordics’. Thereis a long list of other non-human races and groups involved in human affairs andgenetics, but I am focussing on the main themes, players and agendas with regardto human control because otherwise it can get so complicated that the main themecan be lost or diluted. Most of them are different forms of Archon anyway. Theunderground systems and cities are the origin of the legends and accounts allover the world about civilisations within the earth with names like Shambhalaand the much-cited ‘Underworld’ which many have connected to the biblical Hell.Underground cave and cavern systems have been found all over the planet. Apartial list of peoples with underworld legends and mythology include theTurko-Mongols, Aztecs, Babylonians, Buddhists, Celts, Chinese, Christians,Egyptians, Estonians, Fijians, Finnish, Greeks, Hebrews, Hindus, Hopi,Hungarians, Incas, Inuit, Muslims, Jain, Japanese, Koreans, Latvians, Malayans,Indonesians, Maori, Mayans, Scandinavians, Polynesians, Pueblo, Romans, Slavsand Sumerians. This is also the source of the myths about ‘little people’ and‘fairy people’ in countries such as Ireland. Researcher Michael Mott studied theglobal myths about the ‘underground people’ for his book, Caverns, Cauldrons,and Concealed Creatures, and he discovered many common themes with regard tothese entities:> They are mostly reptilian or reptilian humanoids or ‘fair’ and Nordic; they> are telepathic with superior mental powers; they can shape-shift and create> illusions; they want to interbreed with humans and need human blood, flesh and> reproductive materials; they have advanced technology; they have the secret of> immortality; they can fly, either by themselves or with their technology; they> mostly have a malevolent agenda for humans; they cannot survive for long in> direct sunlight; they have been banished from the surface world or are in> hiding from surface people and/or the Sun; they want to keep their treasures,> knowledge and true identity a secret; they covertly manipulate events on the> surface world; they have surface humans working for them through the> priesthoods, cults and secret societies; they have a putrid smell like> ‘sulphur and brimstone’.> The reptilian aspect of some underworlders permeates folklore. One universal> theme that recurs in the folktales of many, many cultures is that of the> snake-husband or snake-wife, who can transform into a ‘human’ or humanoid form> and is invariably of royal blood among his or her own kind (talk about the> ultimate pick-up line!). Often the snake or serpent-man exacts a promise of> marriage, or the hand of an unborn human child in betrothal, consistent with> the theme of the subterranean’s interest in maintaining their own genetic> diversity.> A variant of this should be familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in the> form of ‘The Frog Prince’. The frog-prince is a Handsome Prince, but like the> Japanese seducing dragon, he has a reptilian or amphibian form. The underworld> link is complete, for frequently the frog lives in a deep well, from which he> is discovered or rescued by the female protagonist.> A possible connection is evident in the Scandinavian belief that some dwarves> would ‘turn into toads’, if caught by the Sun, much like Mimoto’s lover turned> from a man into a ‘dragon’ when the same thing happened.

The serpentine-yet-human Nagas> are still believed by devout Hindus and some Buddhists to dwell beneath India,> Nepal and Tibet.This describes the recurring themes about the Archon-Reptilian behaviour andagenda. The smell of sulphur has been described to me many times by those whosay they have been abducted by non-human reptilian entities and Greys. Note theline about the desire to interbreed with humans and their need for human blood,flesh and reproductive materials. This is a universal ancient and modern themewhen you research the Archons in all their various names and guises. They areobsessed with manipulating human genetics. When I say Reptilians I don’t meanthe entire genetic species in all existence, but those that have been ‘adapted’in the usual fashion by the Archons to serve their purposes. They, too, havebeen genetically (energetically) manipulated and I have seen a number of filmsin recent years in which mechanical or robotic reptilian entities invade theplanet. One was Avengers Assemble and they even called the reptilian invadersthe Chitari which is ridiculously close to the Zulu Chitauri. Hollywood isputting much of what is happening – and planned – in our face but withoutrevealing the true significance. The terms ‘mechanical’ and ‘robot-like’ do nothave to refer to technology of the nuts, bolts and metal variety. Biologicalforms are technology to the Archons and they see them for what they are –biological Body-Mind computer systems which can be programmed to serve theirinterests as long as they have no connection worth the name to true Awarenessand Consciousness. Nor does genetic manipulation have to be done throughprocreation. We see today how children can be ‘grown’ in laboratories and allthe other genetic techniques such as gene splicing and the genetic effects onanimals and the ‘natural world’ through genetically-modified (GM/GMO) crops andfood. These are all programs instigated by the Archons with the usual goal ofdistorting what already exists to suit their purposes of human control.Corporations like Monsanto, the major force behind GMO and so many otherabominations, should be renamed Archon-to in the interests of accuracy. Humangenetics are now being manipulated in even more sophisticated ways throughgene-altering drugs and other methods. Researcher Mike Barrett writes:> Although gene-altering drugs are indeed helping to pave the way for further> human genetic modification, it is only a single move in the game. Just a few> months ago, we reported on the very first group of genetically modified babies> being ‘created’ in the United States.

This is known as the Genetic Disc and includes depictions ofhuman eggs and sperm that can only be seen through a microscope (Fig 120). Thedisc is also made of lydite, a very hard stone that breaks up easily when cutbecause of its structure. Researcher Klaus Dona says that experts in the fieldhave told him that it would not be possible to make the same disc today with thesame material. The birth theme continues on the reverse of the disc with imagesof a foetus, but look how the ‘people’ are portrayed – they’re certainly nothuman (Fig 121). Birth instruments made from lydite have also been found thatconfirm an advanced knowledge of the process and the expert opinion is thatthese could not be made today from lydite either. The human body has certainlybeen subjected to substantial gene splicing, which is a bit like cutting framesin a film and putting them back in a different order, to change the geneticstructure. This is done today in laboratories and so how was it done aeons agoby supposedly primitive people? American researcher and writer Lloyd Pye hasbeen studying human origins for decades. He points out that human DNA has morethan 4,000 defects compared with only a few hundred in chimpanzees and gorillas.Mainstream science has acknowledged sudden changes in human genetics about200,000 years ago and again around 35,000 years ago. Remember how Rebecca Cann,Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Hawaii, co-authored a studyin the journal Nature, saying that modern humans are descended from a singlemother who lived in Africa in about 200,000 BC. Timescales for all this aredifficult, not least because time is an illusion, and it is hard to be anythinglike precise even within the human perception of time and history. The Gnostictexts say that the Archons were here before humans and the manipulation has beengoing on pretty much from the start, but it was after geological cataclysm andgenetic manipulation that the control really went into overdrive. My feeling isthat the Earth upheavals I have been talking about and the genetic tinkering goway ‘back’ as we perceive time. There were certainly enormous catastrophes about11,500 years ago and the genetic manipulation has been ongoing. The SumerianTablets say that the Anunnaki-derived kings of Sumer could trace a line back240,000 years. Some researchers into these matters seem to think that the hijackhappened in the last few thousand years, but I don’t agree. I think the Archonmanipulation has been happening since humanity arrived and has unfolded in aseries of stages as the control became much more extreme and severe.[../Images/00260.jpg]Figure 119: The Mesoptamia portrayal of the creation of ‘Adamu’, the newgenetically-manipulated human.[../Images/00163.jpg]Figure 120: The Genetic Disc.[../Images/00417.jpg]Figure 121: The reverse of the disk and its clear images of procreation andgenetics.Transmitted transformation - The HackOther ways that human genetics can be changed are by encoding waveform fieldswith new information that would decode through to the holographic as geneticmutation, or to broadcast information on the frequency range of human geneticsthat would trigger changes in body structure (Fig 122). Remember how the Russianresearch group transformed frog embryos to salamander embryos in one experimentby transmitting salamander DNA information patterns. An Internet articledescribed very well this role of DNA:From the characteristic form of this giant molecule – a wound double helix – theDNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is elongated andthus a blade which can take up very well electrical pulses. On the other hand,seen from above, it has the form of a ring and thus is a very magneticalantenna.[../Images/00138.jpg]Figure 122: If you can communicate information to DNA and human genetics ontheir frequency range you can mutate the human form.There are many ways that human genetics could have been changed, and are stillbeing changed, and I include them in detail in other works. But the nextquestion is, why? Why manipulate human genetics? The quote above is at the coreof it and this brings us to the foundations of human control and manipulation.The themes in the Matrix movies are based on fact in the sense that we areexperiencing a fake reality that has been hacked into the human reality thatexisted before and still exists beyond the frequency walls of the Matrix. TheArchon Matrix transmits within a particular frequency band and human DNA hasbeen manipulated to receive and transmit within that same band. This is the sameprinciple as tuning a radio to a particular frequency to pick up a particularstation. The frequency band on which DNA is transmitting and receiving locks thewhole holographic body-computer into that same band which, through thefive-sense/genetic decoding system, manifests as an apparently experiencedreality in the brain. Humanity was caught in the Matrix – the ‘Hack’ – once DNAbegan to receive information within the frequency band of visible light in theelectromagnetic spectrum (Fig 123). Key to this was, and is, the manipulation ofRNA or Ribonucleic acid (Fig 124). DNA has been the genetic star for decades andRNA a relatively bit-part player, but a big rethink is going on among RNAresearchers like Yoshikazu Nakamura, a professor in the Division of MolecularBiology at the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, who points outthat life was created in ‘the world of RNA’. My great friend, the researcher andcutting-edge healer, Mike Lambert, at the Shen Clinic on the Isle of Wight,worked out long ago that RNA was the dominant force and not DNA. In short, RNAwrites the program that we call DNA. If I put this in computer language then RNAcontrols the mouse and the keyboard and DNA is what appears on the screen. TheArchontic manipulators of human genetics had to change the program, DNA, via theprogrammer, RNA. It is interesting and very significant that some RNAresearchers believe that it was an ‘RNA world’ in ancient times in which RNAplayed the leading role. This would make sense if genetic tinkering took placeto empower the program (DNA) at the expense of its programmer (RNA). Big Pharmacompanies are now introducing drugs to manipulate the functions of RNA,especially through what is called ‘RNA interference’ which aims to switch offgenes claimed to be a threat to health. I say ‘claimed’ because letting thesepeople loose on human genetics is like inviting a bull into china shop. Now wecan see that if the Archontic networks wished to shut down those parts ofgenetic function which allow humans to connect powerfully with the greaterreality they could do this through RNA just as drug companies are seeking to dothe same with their potions and poisons today. The visible light frequency bandof holographic awareness is far narrower than it once was because of thissuppression of the DNA receiver-transmitters via its governor, RNA. Earth peoplebefore the Hack could see much further into the now unseen realms and it isclear to me why visible light is such a ludicrously narrow band of frequency.Ancient texts say that ‘the gods lived among us’, and the ‘gods’ are still wherethey always were in terms of frequency band. It is just that we can’t see themanymore. The Body-Mind computer has been genetically firewalled so that it doesnot decode their range of frequency as it once did. This is precisely the sameprinciple as what the government has done to the Internet in China. The Chinesecomputer system has been firewalled – the so-called Great Firewall of China – toensure that it will not decode great swathes of the World Wide Web whichcontains information that they don’t want the population to see. This is whathas been done to humanity as a whole. The Archons don’t want us to see anythingthat would open our eyes, or rather our minds, to the truth that would set usfree. As the saying goes: ‘The eyes are useless when the mind is blind.’ TheMatrix Hack is the very symbol on a fantastic scale for what the Archons standfor – deception. The Gnostics said that the Demiurge and his Archons haddominion over the solar system, but not the Earth, Sun and Moon. They said thatthe Earth is not originally from this system, but was drawn in and captured.They said that the Sun, Moon and Earth were originally designed to be athree-body system. This supports what I said in Remember Who You Are that theEarth is ‘not from these parts’. It is certainly true that there areextraordinary mathematical and geometrical connections and ‘coincidences’between the Earth, Sun and Moon that do not apply to any other bodies in thesolar system – once again see Remember Who You Are and Human Race Get Off YourKnees. I mean, look at the Earth. Why is it so extraordinarily different to therest of the solar system? The Gnostic texts say that humans lived in an organicrealm while the Archon world is inorganic. Definitions of inorganic include:relating to compounds not containing hydrocarbon groups and not arising innormal growth: artificial. This is certainly the way the Gnostics described theArchons.[../Images/00460.jpg]Figure 123: Human reality has been hacked by fake information which humansdecode into a fake reality. (see colour scetion.)[../Images/00085.jpg]Figure 124: RNA is the writer of DNA. Hack into RNA and DNA is yours.Physicists: ‘We may live in a computer simulation’We are now seeing even mainstream scientists asking if our reality is asimulation often because it is the only explanation that makes sense of whatthey are observing. Physicists at the University of Bonn in Germany revealed in2012 that they may have evidence that the universe is a computer simulation.They pointed out in a paper called ‘Constraints on the Universe as a NumericalSimulation’ that simply being a simulation would create its own ‘laws ofphysics’ that would limit possibility. This is exactly what I have been sayingin my books for years: Where do the laws of physics come from? – click, click,enter. The writers of the program decided what they were going to be. This iswhy when people have experiences outside of the body (the Hack) they experiencean entirely different reality with none of the limitations they were subject tobefore. Scientists talk about a phenomenon known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin,or GZK, cut-off, which is an apparent boundary for cosmic ray particles causedby interaction with cosmic background radiation. The University of Bonn papersays that this ‘pattern of constraint’ mirrors what you would find with acomputer simulation. They say that like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell wewould not be able to see the ‘walls’ of our prison, but through physics we maybe able to identify them. This is once again right in line with my books overthe years in which I have described the frequency/vibrational ‘walls’ of oursimulated ‘hacked’ reality and said that the outermost wall is what we call thespeed of light (officially186,000 miles per second). Albert Einstein said thatwas the fastest speed possible, but it is not. There is no fastest or slowestwithin All Possibility. Einstein’s speed of light is the edge of the Matrix, thefake reality. I watched a BBC ‘science’ programme spend an hour asking ‘what isthe biggest number?’ when there is no biggest number within All Possibility, nora smallest. What about zero? But that is only a human concept within a tinyfrequency band of manipulated reality. It might be worth remembering thatsentence whenever someone says that something is impossible – ‘a human conceptwithin a tiny frequency band of manipulated reality’. Strange things appear tohappen close to the speed of light such as ‘time’ slowing down and otherphenomena because this is the point where the Matrix ends and the reality beyondit begins (the meeting of two very different information fields operating ondifferent frequencies). The speed of light is at the very edge of thebody-computer’s ability to consciously decode reality and that’s why everythinggoes haywire. The more we believe that the speed of light is the fastest speedpossible the more that becomes our sense of reality. Our sense of reality thenbecomes our experienced (decoded) reality. It is the same principle as ahypnotist implanting a false belief (sense of reality) and the subject thenexperiencing that belief – as with Tom who couldn’t see his daughter. Humans arebeing programmed this way 24/7 by the repetition of ‘facts’ that are nothingmore than false suppositions about a false reality. We will only crack the speedof light when we stop believing it’s impossible. Look at the four minute mile.It was considered to be impossible to run a mile in less than four minutes, butwhen someone achieved that by a fraction of a second soon others did the same.The Control System knows this and you might have noticed that whenever anyonesays they have made something move faster than the speed of light the‘scientific’ establishment comes down on them from a great height. Those trappedby the five senses and Body-Mind are entrapped within the Matrix and those opento Consciousness/Awareness beyond that frequency band are able to see andunderstand what five-senses cannot. The five-senses respond by calling theothers mad because from their point of perception – within the simulation – theycannot compute and integrate what is being said. Oxford professor Nick Bostromsuggested in 2003 that we may be living in a computer simulation and calculatedthe ‘computational requirements’ to construct one. The team at the University ofBonn are embarked on doing pretty much just that by building a minute version ofthe universe even smaller than nano-scale. An Internet report said:> And to help isolate the sought-after signature, the physicists are simulating> quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the fundamental force in nature that> gives rise to the strong nuclear force among protons and neutrons, and to> nuclei and their interactions. To replace the space-time continuum, they are> computing tiny, tightly spaced cubic ‘lattices’. They call this ‘lattice gauge> theory’ and it is subsequently providing new insights into the nature of> matter itself.> Interestingly, the researchers consider their simulation to be a forerunner to> more powerful versions in which molecules, cells, and even humans themselves> might someday be generated. But for now, they’re interested in creating> accurate models of cosmological processes — and finding out which ones might> represent hard limits for simulations.> To that end, they have investigated the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (or GZK> cut-off) as a candidate – a cut- off in the spectrum of high energy particles.> The GZK cut-off is particularly promising because it behaves quite> interestingly within the QCD model.> And that would be the kind of reveal the physicists are looking for — an> indication that there is indeed a man hiding behind the curtain.American theoretical physicist James Gates, the John S. Toll Professor ofPhysics at the University of Maryland, and the Director of The Center for Stringand Particle Theory, wrote an article in Physics World in 2012 also describinghow the evidence may be there to show that our reality is a simulation akin tothe movie, The Matrix. He says that he and his team of researchers havediscovered equations in the fabric of the universe (I would say the Hack) thatcontain embedded computer codes of digital data. They take the form of 1 and 0 –the binary system of on-off electrical charges used by computers and he says:‘We have no idea what they are doing there.’ I can help them with that. He saidthat detecting computer codes would be a way of confirming that we live in asimulation and now he had found them. He agreed that what we call ‘nature’ canbe reduced to a set of equations found in computer coding. Computers and otherelectrical technology are embedded with mathematical sequences known aserrorcorrecting codes or block codes which return data to its original state ifsomething changes or interferes with it during transmission. Gates and his teamhave found these sequences within the fabric of our reality, but they don’t knowwhat they are doing there. I would answer that question with a simple response:the correcting codes are there to ensure that the Matrix remains stable – theHack stays in place – and that when other data (thought or non-Matrix sources ofinformation) threaten to intervene their effect on the digital fabric of theHack is filtered out and the Matrix protected. But there are levels of energeticpower – expanded Consciousness within and without the Matrix – that these codescannot deal with. When people awaken to a greater vision of self and reality thewaveform effect of this is also expressed digitally and once we reach acollective critical mass of expanded awareness the fabric of the Matrix mustunravel and the Hack will be no more. A study published in Nature’s ScientificReports likened the universe to a giant brain. It said that the way the universeevolves is the same as the Internet and the human brain. Well, yes because theuniverse is a Cosmic Internet – or the Hack is, in our case – and the humanbrain is a smaller version of the Cosmic Internet in the sense of as above, sobelow. A co-author of the study, Dmitri Krioukov from the University ofCalifornia San Diego, said: ‘For a physicist it’s an immediate signal that thereis some missing understanding of how nature works’. What is ‘missing’ is theunderstanding that it is a computer program – the ‘dream’ that hacked a dream.American author and poet Edgar Alan Poe wrote that all we see or seem is but adream within a dream and Morpheus put it like this in The Matrix:> Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you> were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between> the dream world and the real world?So how much of the ‘real world’ does the Matrix Hack allows us to see? The moremy Awareness expands I am concluding none at all; or at least none in terms ofperceiving the original in its original form. What we are ‘seeing’ (decoding) isa bad copy of the original which has been subsequently even further manipulated,changed and distorted to increase the scale of limitation and perceptiondeception. I have certainly looked up at the sky a number of times in my lifeand wondered if it was all just a projection. I vividly remember going to theLondon Planetarium as a small kid in the 1950s and being shocked when the lightswent down and I saw the night sky projected onto the domed ceiling. It looked so‘real’ and that is a moment which has never left me, as I explained in RememberWho You Are. I had the same feeling when I watched the movie, The Truman Show.The main character played by Jim Carrey was born onto the giant set of a soapopera, but he never knew that. He thought it was real as he grew into an adultwhile all the time he was being watched on television in a ‘real’ world that hehad never seen. Eventually he realises that he is living in a giant dome and thesun and moon coming up and down to give the impression of day and night was alla technologically-driven illusion. The control module from which it was alldirected looked like our Moon and that’s very appropriate as we shall see. Theterm ‘firmament’ used in the Genesis creation narrative actually means ‘vastdome’ and ‘beyond the firmament’ in this context becomes ‘beyond the Matrix’;beyond the ‘vast dome’ (Fig 125). The word dome is used in modern editions ofthe Bible:[../Images/00075.jpg]Figure 125: A portayal of the ‘vast dome’ or firmament.> And God said, ‘Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day> from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and> years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the> earth.’ And it was so.> God made the two great lights – the greater light to rule the day and the> lesser light to rule the night – and the stars. God set them in the dome of> the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night,> and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And> there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day – Genesis 1:14-19.The Matrix works by blocking information that would normally be decoded byhumans and replacing this with fake information which is then decoded asreality. This is nothing like as difficult as it may seem and a similar blockingmechanism is acknowledged to be at work in the Earth’s atmosphere. A NASAwebsite says:> Earth’s atmosphere, however, acts an opaque barrier to much of the> electromagnetic spectrum. The atmosphere absorbs most of the wavelengths> shorter than ultraviolet, most of the wavelengths between infrared and> microwaves, and most of the longest radio waves. For radio astronomers this> leaves only short wave radio to penetrate the atmosphere and bring information> about the universe to our Earth-bound instruments.> The main frequency ranges allowed to pass through the atmosphere are referred> to as the radio window. The radio window consists of frequencies which range> from about 5 MHz (5 million hertz) to 30 GHz (30 billion hertz). The> low-frequency end of the window is limited by signals being reflected by the> ionosphere back into space, while the upper limit is caused by absorption of> the radio waves by water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Technology like analogue television broadcasts can prevent us seeing wholegalaxies within its frequency range. New Scientist, the mainstream UK sciencemagazine, reported that there was a race to study galaxies that were suddenlyrevealed in the range between 700 and 800 megahertz when the United Statesswitched from analogue to digital television. The article called this a once ina lifetime opportunity to see galaxies in this range before the old analoguefrequencies were designated for other technology. Whole galaxies were notvisible just because Americans were watching the television and those withdramatically more advanced technological knowledge could not do what I am sayingthey are doing with regard to the Matrix?? A team from Imperial College London,and Salford University in the North West of England, is already developing a‘space-time cloak’ which manipulates light and conceals whole events from anobserver. They say that, for example, a safecracker could enter a building, openthe safe, take what he wanted and leave while the security cameras would see thedoor closed the entire time. This is done with something called ‘metamaterials’which interfere with light at specific wavelengths and this makes light (simplyinformation) deviate around an object in specific colours (frequencies) of thelight spectrum. We can only see things when light is reflected from them and sometamaterials make objects invisible to us. A media report about the projectexplained:> The theory is based on censoring the flow of events, which we perceive as a> stream of light particles, also called photons, that strike the retina. By> exploiting a characteristic of fibre optics, the flow of photons can be> slowed, events edited out and stitched back together ...Photons are emitted by the Sun along with many other forms of information andthe Matrix works by blocking and re-encoding this information to feed us fakeinformation and so a fake decoded reality. In the language of metamaterials, theMatrix is ‘censoring the flow of events’ and ‘interfering with light at specificwavelengths’ (Fig 126).[../Images/00266.jpg]Figure 126: The matrix projects a fake reality – The Hack – while blocking outthe original reality.Light is good? Mmmm?It is my view after all these years and so many ‘hints’ and pointing fingersfrom the synchronicity of my life that the electromagnetic spectrum is the‘Hack’. From this frequency band comes what we call ‘light’ and we are led tobelieve that ‘light’ is good and ‘dark’ is bad. People talk about ‘seeing thelight’, ‘being in the light’, even being a ‘light worker’. But is the frequencyband of light really what it is said to be? Or is it the very reality that holdsus in illusory servitude? I would say the latter. It is important to constantlyremember that the Archon conspiracy is founded entirely– entirely – ondeception; and the deception goes deeper than people can begin to imagine.Everything is upside down – inverted. Black is white, light is ‘dark’. Or darkin the sense that so many use the word, as in not nice. We see light as goodbecause it is the only way that we ‘see’. But hold on. Isn’t the whole idea ofthe Archon conspiracy to make us ‘see’ what they want us to see? Light is afrequency range to which the Body-Mind computer was tuned by geneticmanipulation (Fig 127). It is no accident that secret societies and Satanismworships the Demiurge/Satan/Lucifer as the ‘Light-Bringer’. If we were tuned toanother frequency band outside of what we call ‘light’, we would decode thatinformation and still be able to ‘see’ what was decoded. Near-death experiencers‘see’ even when they have left their bodies and so have no ‘eyes’. It’s allillusion and light is thoroughly and utterly misunderstood and misrepresented.When I experienced the still and silent All That Is during my ayahuasca state inBrazil I did not experience that as ‘light’ but as All Knowing darkness. Realityis very different beyond this frequency band with very different ‘laws ofphysics’ and limitless potential compared with what we experience within theMatrix. I don’t believe that positive-negative polarities exist beyond theMatrix in the way that we experience them. Polarities are necessary to divideand rule and we see them throughout human society as well as in the domain ofhuman physics. Polarities are needed to generate electricity and soelectromagnetism which I say is the Matrix. Another polarity is the male andfemale form. Humans before the intervention were more like androgynous beingswith no distinct male-female division. The same Biblical texts that talk aboutGod (the gods) creating humans in ‘His’ image also say: ‘Male and female hecreated them ...’ (Genesis 1:26-28). The creation of Eve from the ‘rib’ (lifeessence) of Adam refers to the same systematic act of division. Beyond thisreality in realms of expanded awareness there is Oneness, unity, not divisionand polarity. People say that we need polarities to complement each other andachieve balance. But does energetic balance and harmony have to manifest throughcompeting forces or could it be a force in and of itself with no competingpolarities necessary? I would say so. The overwhelming majority of whatscientists are seeking to understand, and the assumptions they peddle as fact,are related to the fake Matrix and not the wider reality. They are trying tounderstand a universe they believe is ‘natural’ when it is the equivalent of acomputer simulation. No wonder they are so flummoxed.[../Images/00115.jpg]Figure 127: The Archons have tuned humans into their Matrix.The time crime‘Time’ gets slower close to the speed of light. How can this be when there is notime? And how could it happen even if time did exist? Shouldn’t time be constantif it’s ‘real’? But it’s not. It is relative to the observer, as Einstein said.I’m sure most people have had the experience in the company of people that borethem that time can seem to pass very slowly and the opposite is true when anexperience is stimulating and enjoyable. The passage of what is called ‘time’ isrelative to the experiencer and how they are decoding and constructing what wecall time. I know how fast ‘time’ seems to go when I am ‘in the zone’ writingbooks or at speaking events. If you watch a train from the side of the track itappears to be moving faster than it does to those inside the train and if youtravelled in a space craft at close to the speed of light for a while yourrelation to time would be way different to those back on Earth. I saw thisexplanation in an Internet article:> If Mary was travelling close to the speed of light and she travelled for one> year according to her watch before returning to Earth, she would return to> find that close to 20 years had passed on Earth. Also, [her partner] Bill was> no longer waiting for her. Relative to Mary, time had passed one year.> It just took longer for that year to pass for Mary in her ship than it did for> Bill on Earth. Even though 20 years had passed on Earth, for Mary in her ship,> she saw only one year had passed because she was travelling much faster than> Bill on Earth and time slowed down for her and time passed at a slower rate> than it did for Bill. Time seems like it’s passing at the same rate for> everyone, everywhere but it’s not. Time itself is an illusion.It is indeed. What we call time is the way Body-Mind compiles events in the NOWinto a sequence. Everything is happening simultaneously in the NOW and ‘time’ ishow we put those NOW events into an apparent sequence that appears to move fromA through B to C and forward in ‘time’. The speed at which we make that sequenceappear to move dictates how quickly or slowly ‘time’ seems to pass (Fig 128).There is no such thing as time travel because there is no such thing as time.What we think of as time travel is the transfer of our point of attention intorealities that all exist simultaneously in the NOW. It is our perception thatlabels them ‘past’ and ‘future’. Time, space, even movement are illusions of thedecoding process. Certain brain (decoding) malfunctions make people see whatshould be flowing liquid as a single freeze frame or a car in the distance onesecond then passing them the next with nothing in between. This is like runninga film with lots of frames taken out to create what is called a ‘jump cut’ asthe sequence suddenly jumps from one thing to another. Another point about‘time’: if it doesn’t exist why do we age? Why does someone at close to thespeed of light age far slower than someone who is not? Age, like time, space andmovement, is a program – encoded software which the Body-Mind computer reads andresponds to. The Archons don’t want humans living incredibly long lives as theydid before the ‘Hack’ (the apparently ridiculously long lives attributed topeople in ancient texts are describing how it used to be). The longer youexperience this reality the more chance you have of realising what the game isfor a start and alerting others. So they have inserted biological programs tokeep lives far shorter than they need to be. It is a death program, nothingless. Consciousness can override the program, however, and all programs, if weopen our minds and allow it in. This is another reason why the time illusion hasbeen encoded into the Matrix. While the reality of Body-Mind is locked into theflow of what it perceives as past, present and future, Consciousness is in astate of the no-time NOW. This disparity alone creates a perceptiondisconnection which is exactly what the Archontic Control System wants toachieve. An earlier Neil Hague image symbolises what I mean (Fig 129). There isone other point to make here. The Matrix illusion extends beyond the world ofonly the five senses. Gnostic texts describe this in their own way, too. TheMatrix has other frequency bands which entrap those who withdraw from the bodyat what is referred to as ‘death’ while not being in a waveform/vibrationalstate that can escape these other levels of the Matrix flytrap. Once again it isall about the point of attention. If, at illusory ‘death’, the point ofattention remains in Body-Mind mode then all that happens is that the bodyceases to function and the point of attention is left in a state of Mind withoutBody. But Mind is still in the Matrix and by transferring the point of attentiononly from Body-Mind to Mind it remains in the Matrix at other frequency bands(Fig 130). John Lamb Lash writes in his book about Gnostic belief Not In HisImage: ‘The Archontic heaven is the afterworld for countless humans who areduped by simulation ...’ The Gnostics said that to escape the fake reality afterwhat we call death you had to pass through the realm of the planetary spherescontrolled by the Archons. We see them as ‘solid’ bodies orbiting the Sun, butthat is only the holographic level. In the deeper energetic levels beyondvisible light they are aspects of another level of the energy matrix designed toentrap discarnate ‘souls’ in the so-called reincarnation cycle. Gnostics saidthat the outermost planetary sphere or Archon was Saturn and beyond that wasLeviathan, a snake swallowing its own tail in the form that has become known asthe Ouroboros (Fig 131). This context of Saturn is going to be very significantin due course. The Gnostics said that souls had to pass through this to reachParadise. This reminds me of the term ‘Ring-Pass-Not’. I came across this manyyears ago and the definition in G de Purucker’s Occult Glossary is very apt:[../Images/00284.jpg]Figure 128: The time illusion can be manipulated by the way the apparent passageof events is decoded and constructed.[../Images/00400.jpg]Figure 129: ‘No-time and an obsession with time means never the twain shallmeet.[../Images/00142.jpg]Figure 130: To escape the Matrix is to escape the obsession with the ‘physical’and ‘material’.[../Images/00061.jpg]Figure 131: The realm of the Ouroboros or Ring-Pass-Not goes out from the Earthas far as Saturn according to the Gnostic texts.> A profoundly mystical and suggestive term signifying the circle or bounds of> frontiers within which is contained the consciousness of those who are still> under the sway of the delusion of separateness – and this applies whether the> Ring be large or small. It does not signify any one especial occasion or> condition, but is a general term applicable to any state in which an entity,> having reached a certain stage of evolutionary growth of the unfolding of> consciousness, finds itself unable to pass into a still higher state because> of some delusion under which the consciousness is laboring, be that delusion> mental or spiritual.You only escape the Matrix by transferring the point of attention from Body-Mindinto Consciousness, the true self beyond the Matrix (Fig 132). It is largely thepoints of attention in the realms of discarnate Mind that communicate throughstage and television psychics and so continue to relate closely with the‘physical’ because they are only a whisker away in frequency terms. These mayalso be the origin of many ghostly entities that people see in an etherealstate. What I am describing here explains reincarnation. This belief has itsorigins in ancient India and the religions of the East and these werefundamentally influenced by the Archontic serpent gods. Reincarnation stems fromthe belief that ‘souls’ must continually reincarnate into different bodies andsituations until they become ‘enlightened’ and able to escape the reincarnationcycle and get out of here. This describes the way that I am saying the Matrixfunctions. The Archons and their Demiurge master don’t want us to escape theflytrap because they feed off our energy for reasons I will be explaining andthat process happens at all levels of the Matrix. We are their power source andsource of creative imagination and they don’t want to ‘lose’ any of us. Firstthing: we do not need to seek enlightenment because we are already enlightenedAll Possibility. What we need to do is delete the programs and energetic skinsof the onion that disconnect us from the influence of that enlightenment. Thepositive view of so-called reincarnation is that we become enlightened by longand continuous experience until we realise that we are already enlightened. Butexperience can also add still more layers to the onion and take us deeper intoignorance and amnesia. When the voice in Brazil was talking to me in theayahuasca session I was shown an image of a path across a field. People begandropping from the sky onto the path and as they walked they wore it away untilit morphed into a groove like those on the old vinyl records. The groove wentdeeper and deeper and became very dark. The symbolism and the words describedhow when an entrapped mind reincarnates into holographic reality it is already‘in the groove’, in the program, even before the new programming begins.[../Images/00397.jpg]Figure 132: ‘Our point of attention or sense of reality is key to freeingourselves from the Matrix in ‘life’ and what we call ‘death’, or the ‘after’(continuation of) life.The more that people are awakened to the true self, the nature of reality andthe illusions of the Matrix, the more certain they are to escape its clutcheswhen they withdraw from the body. Oh, yes, withdrawing from the body. What atale this next man has to tell."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00411.jpg]‘Dead’ for a week but back to tell the taleAs a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death.Leonardo da VinciIt is always good – indeed essential – within this crazy and ludicrous madhouseknown as human society to see beyond its illusions and delusions to the primereality that lies beyond the vibrational prison cell. This ‘world’ – thisholographic illusion – may be as it is, but infinite reality is something else.I have been saying and writing for so many years that one sentence canencapsulate the totality of life, of existence, of being: Infinite Love Is TheOnly Truth – Everything Else Is Illusion.That was indeed the title of a book that I published in 2003 and how fantasticit was to read the account nearly a decade later of someone who has ‘been there’and can remember the experience which confirms that simple fact: Infinitereality is Infinite Love. Our current reality is an extreme distortion of that‘norm’ – not a ‘norm’ in itself. I have explained why that distortion exists –why our reality is so imbalanced and insane – but beyond this ‘world’ (frequencyrange) lies an over-the-rainbow paradise that so many have described who havebeen there and returned to tell the tale. What makes this example so telling andcompelling, however, is that the source is an American neurosurgeon who couldnot have been a more concrete-minded, dogmatic, this-world-is-all-there-is, thebrain-is-Consciousness sceptic if he had worked at it his whole life – and inmany ways he did. Then his brain shut down for seven days and the man who ‘cameback’ was not the man who ‘went away’. Dr Eben Alexander was an academicneurosurgeon at Harvard for 15 years and, as he himself says, you could hardlymeet a more staunch advocate of the close-minded rejection by mainstream‘science’ of the continuation of life after the death of the body-brain (Fig133). To him the brain generated what is called Consciousness and so it wasimpossible for Consciousness to continue to exist after the brain had ceased tofunction. This is the crap on which Establishment ‘science’ has been foundedfrom the start because it has always been designed to detach the population froman awareness – the memory – of their true and infinite nature. Two of its majoradvocates in the UK are the clueless couple, Professor Richard ‘Dogma’ Dawkinsat Oxford University and Christopher French, Professor of Psychology atGoldsmiths College, University of London. French is also the Editor-in-Chief ofThe Skeptic magazine in the UK which is the propaganda arm of the concrete mind(Fig 134). These people condemn what they call ‘pseudoscience’ while beingprofessional purveyors of it. A review of a Dawkins book said:> Dawkins believes in absolute reality. He does not believe that reality is> malleable. Dawkins admits his understanding of quantum mechanics is foggy and> so declines to delve very far into that topic.[../Images/00179.jpg]Figure 133: Dr Eben AlexanderTakes long, deep slow breaths and rubs eyes vigorously to check focus. No, itreally says that. An Oxford ‘professor’ who attacks, ridicules and vilifiesthose who have a different version of reality to him believes in ‘absolutereality’ while at the same time saying that his ‘understanding of quantummechanics [which proves that it is not absolute] is foggy and so declines todelve very far into that topic.’ They are left-brain prisoners sitting in theirperception cells while believing they are free-thinking and intelligent – ‘Thisis my belief, now don’t you dare show me any evidence to the contrary or I’llshoot.’ And still they have the nerve and stunning self-delusion to talk aboutpseudoscience and parrot crap like this from Dawkins: ‘You cannot be both saneand well-educated and disbelieve in evolution ... the evidence is so strong thatany sane, educated person has got to believe in evolution.’ Well, so long as youignore quantum physics. The arrogance is breathtaking – if you don’t accept whatI believe then you are, by definition, neither sane nor educated. The mainstreammedia is dominated by the pseudoscience of people like Dawkins and Frenchbecause mainstream ‘science’ is considered to be the cutting edge of knowledgewhen most of it is light years off the pace. These people have becomewell-adjusted to a pseudoscientific dogma that excludes even a discipline withinits own ranks – quantum mechanics and the study of the subatomic world. Theirflawed perception of reality (it has to be flawed by the very definition of notincluding quantum revelations) is like an addiction to them. They cannotconceive of anything else and this is what the Skeptic, or Septic, Society isreally all about – defending a view of reality that excludes quantum physics. Itis the very definition of pseudoscience and what they call the ‘scientificmethod’ or ‘evidence-based science’ does not include all the possible evidence,but only that produced within the rigid parameters of what they decide isevidence. They talk about the repetition of (often rigged) results in scientific‘experiments’, peer reviews and ‘empirical evidence’, but they fail to see thatthis has parked them in a cul-de- sac when it comes to understanding reality andhas delivered endless horrors upon human society including genetically-modified‘food’, thalidomide and a stream of other health-destroying, mind-destroyingdrugs, vaccines, potions and poisons. Nothing can be credible withoutencompassing the quantum realm because that is the information blueprint fromwhich the holographic ‘physical’ world is projected and so anything that focusesonly on the projection – for example, the body as we see it – can only evertreat the symptom not the cause. Do you change a movie on the screen or on theDVD? This Stone Age ‘science’ can also wreak mayhem within the blueprint in thesame way that your car engine would be a heap of junk if you gave someoneclueless about mechanics a bag of tools and free reign to do what he liked –‘yes doctor, thank-you doctor, anything you say doctor.’ This why, through the‘scientific method’, the biggest killer in the United States has become thetreatment. I see this all the time with the scientific (it says here)mainstream. They have to acknowledge that quantum physics exists because it,well, exists; but then they look the other way and crack on as before whenwithout an understanding of the quantum world from which the ‘real’ world ismade manifest you cannot understand anything. Their belief is a form ofaddiction, yes, but also an expression of fear. They know that if theyencompassed quantum reality into specialist areas such as biology on whichDawkins claims to be an expert then everything would have to be re-evaluated andviewed in a completely different context. They don’t want to do that and acceptthey have been misguided their entire academic careers and so they do whatDawkins does – ignore quantum reality altogether. This for me is such an extremeand clearly crazy way to explore the mysteries of reality that it closes in oninsanity in the sense of the scale of self-delusion. It is a type ofschizophrenia in that the mind shuts itself away in a compartment of perceptionto hold the line against information and evidence that would demolish theprevailing belief system. But they still think they are ‘well-adjusted’ incontrast to those who can see the madness – the ones they condemn as misguidedand crazy.[../Images/00449.jpg]Figure 134: Christopher French is desperate to protect the pseudo-scientificstatus quo and if he really was promoting science he wouldn’t talk the crap thathe does.Many of my books are so big and my talks so long because of all the connectionsthat have to be made to reveal the overall tapestry of manipulation. Forexample, you have to realise that there is a conspiracy to enslave humanitymentally and emotionally through deceit and ignorance before you can appreciatewhy a key part of that conspiracy is to ensure that people en masse forget whothey really are. A global population aware of its true and infinite nature couldnever begin to be mass controlled. But with a population that thinks it can bedefined by name, job, background, culture, race or income bracket such controlis a cinch. The latter defines and decodes reality through the tiny frequencyrange of the five senses (‘visible light’) while those awakening to theirInfinite Awareness have a far more expanded range and depth of vision andinsight which can see through the lies, deceit and fake perceptions of the‘world’. Fundamental to the suppression of awareness is controlling the accepted‘norms’ of academics and mainstream ‘scientists’. You give them a reality songsheet from the first moment they enter the ‘education’ system and you turn andturn the screw as they continue through college and university and into theirspecialisation of academia, science or medicine. As Albert Einstein said: ‘Theonly thing that interferes with my learning is my education.’ You then rewardthem if they keep to the song sheet with top jobs, titles and prestige and theybecome the ‘voice’ (your voice) for what is (and isn’t) real and unreal,possible and impossible, sane and insane. They don’t need evidence for what theysay – only that unquestioning certainty that the system must know best. This ispassed down to the population as the academic/doctor/scientist must know bestwhen they are only saying what they are because they believe, in the same way,that the system which has indoctrinated them must know best. They are also wellaware that to deviate from the system’s norms is to lose their top jobs, titles,prestige and very tidy income thank you very much. Eben Alexander did not seemto be motivated by the income bit, but simply bought the line that had beendrilled into him since he was young – science knows best. Well, it doesn’t. Ifthe totality of mainstream science were a human being it would be dubbed theVillage Idiot compared with what there is to know. But then, this is exactly thetype of mentality that the system seeks out to sell and program its propagandaabout reality and the nature of life itself. In turn, anyone who challengesthose norms, or has near-death experiences and ‘sees’ the truth, is immediatelybranded crazy, delusional, a charlatan or a liar. Defend the norms at all costs– my big house and funding budget depend upon it. Dr Eben Alexander tells in hisbook, Proof of Heaven, how he dismissed accounts from his patients of theirexperiences in other realities during near-death experiences or ‘NDEs’. Hewrites:> Wonderful stuff, no question. But all of it, in my opinion, was pure fantasy.> What caused the otherworldly types of experiences that such people so often> report? I didn’t claim to know, but I did know that it was all brain-based.> All of Consciousness is.

Pull the plug and the TV goes> dead. The show is over, no matter how much you might have been enjoying it.But then Eben’s brain did shut down – and the show went on.‘Stadium’ in the headMy contention has long been that the brain/body is a form of biologicalcomputer, but its function is not to produce Consciousness. Its role is todecode, not create, and to process the information contained withinConsciousness. So the more expanded the Consciousness that the brain isprocessing the more expanded will be the Awareness that it is able to manifestas experienced reality. The only creative function of the brain is how itchooses, or is programmed to choose, the information that it is processing. Whatit decodes and what it doesn’t = the person’s experienced reality. The entireglobal conspiracy is actually founded on programming the brain to decode realityin a desperately limited way to subsequently limit the awareness of the humantargets and so the ‘stadium’ in which life and the conspiracy are playing outwithin a few cubic centimetres of the brain where lies the visual decodingprocesses. What a computer decodes we see on the screen and what the braindecodes we see on our screen as an apparently ‘physical’ world; but change theinformation and you change the decoded – experienced – world. The Archonticforce and its representatives in our reality are seeking to dictate whathumanity manifests as ‘life’ by programming its perception of reality. A stagehypnotist is doing just this with hypnotic implants that convince the stoogesthat they are playing a trombone or they are seeing an elephant in the audience.This belief (perception download) then influences the brain to decode thatbelief into holographic reality. Remember Tom when he couldn’t see his daughter?The Archontic Control System does exactly the same through hypnotists known astelevision and the media in general, ‘education’, academia, medicine, peerpressure, programmed parents programming their children, religion and so on (Fig135). Closed minds are easy to mass control because they block most of theinformation available within Consciousness, while open minds which allowexpanded Consciousness through for the brain to process are quite somethingelse. The Archons want Consciousness to be a spectator while reality,perception, action and behaviour are dictated by the computer processes of thebrain (Figs 136 and 137). This is like going on the Internet and allowing thecomputer to decide where it goes and what it thinks of where it goes rather thanthe person at the keyboard. Einstein said: ‘The intuitive mind [Consciousnessbeyond the Body-Mind] is a sacred gift and the rational mind [Mind-Body] is afaithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and hasforgotten the gift’. This is the mind of the unquestioning know-it-all academic,doctor and scientist. It is the system’s mind and without it the system couldnot exist. It is the state of perception that Einstein called the ‘rational’mind. But it isn’t rational. The word should really be irrational – ‘not endowedwith reason’ – because it refuses to open-mindedly assess all the evidenceavailable before reaching its unyielding conclusions (Fig 138). But this imagein Figure 139 symbolises the awakening mind which expands its perceptions of thepossible to Infinite Possibility and allows through the love, knowledge – AllKnowingness – of Infinite reality where everything is connected, everything isOne, and the illusion of separation is no more. This is what Einstein referredto as the ‘intuitive mind’. I prefer the knowing mind, but this state ofawareness is not really mind at all. It is Consciousness beyond mind. In humanterms this is the ‘mind’ of the maverick, the mystic, the Knower beyond the mereThinker. These are the people who have been marginalised, ridiculed, condemned,often jailed and killed, throughout known human history. The closed mind fearsthe open one, for it fears what it cannot comprehend, what it cannot process orunderstand. Then there are those in the shadows manipulating the ignorant intoretribution against the conscious because this Archontic Cabal knows theconsequences for its hidden power of an awakening people (Fig 140). This is whyignorance has always sought to crush and stifle the conscious at every turn.[../Images/00360.jpg]Figure 135: Much of humanity is in a hypnotic trance while thinking it is awake.[../Images/00528.jpg]Figure 136: People live virtual-reality lives without realising what they areexperiencing. some plan and work to a goal.[../Images/00069.jpg]Figure 137: ... while others make it up as they go along.

What we call the ‘individual’> is only a focus or point of attention within Infinite Awareness – a droplet> (point of attention) within the ocean (all possible points of attention).> • This ocean of Consciousness is an expression of the All That Is And Ever> Can Be – the Infinite everything (and nothing), everywhere (and nowhere), is> (and isn’t) – All Possibility.> • The All That Is in its prime state is experienced as All Knowing silence> and stillness. This is what some people call the ‘Void’ – the ‘ocean’ point of> attention where the question and the answer, knower and the known, dreamer and> the dream are the all same thing.> • We are both the temporary point of attention (I am Charlie Jones, I am Mary> Smith) and the entirety of existence – All That Is And Ever Can Be.> • Our point of attention can be as massive or as infinitesimal as we choose> or allow it to be. We can perceive ourselves as Charlie Jones or Mary Smith or> as Infinite Awareness having a temporary experience (point of attention)> called Charlie Jones and Mary Smith.> • The body-brain is a biological computer system that focusses the attention> of Consciousness on a tiny frequency range which science calls ‘visible> light’, a range so small compared with Infinite existence as to be hilarious> and bordering on total blindness.> • DNA is a receiver-transmitter of information that interacts with the wider> reality (the Cosmic Internet as I call it) and the frequency band that DNA is> tuned to dictates the decoded reality experienced by what is known as the> conscious mind.> • ‘Time’ and ‘space’ are decoded illusions of our reality and do not exist> beyond its tiny frequency range.> • There are other frequency levels of the Earth that are very different to> this one – far less dense energetically, with vibrant, vivid colour,> unconditional love and with the absence of limitation that we only experience> in what we call dreams.> • A force known as the Archons, Jinn, Demons, Reptilians and many other names> in different cultures has hacked into that level of Earth reality and created> a fake subreality which is a manipulated distortion of that ‘other’ Earth – it> is like making a very bad copy. This hack is being fed to us to decode into> experienced reality.> • So the ‘Hack’ is the world that we experience and the energetic origin from> which it is projected is what people call ‘Hell’. Our reality is a holographic> projection from what we call ‘Hell’. In short, we are not going to Hell – we> are already living in a projection from the ‘Hell’ which is the Archontic> realm.This is basically what the Gnostics believed, a mystic and shaman-type peoplewho were constantly suppressed and often killed by the prevailing order – theRoman Church – at the time. The Gnostics described the Archons as masters ofdeception capable of manipulating humanity by generating virtual realities. Thisis what they have done with their ‘Hack’, their deeply flawed holographic copyof the ‘real’ Earth. Their world matches the descriptions of Hell and from therethey project the virtual-reality ‘Hell’ that Earth has become for so many. Theirreality is very close to ours in frequency terms and it is dark, dank,mechanical and machine-like without inspiration or creativity and with the smellof death and decay. It is the world of the ‘living dead’ portrayed so often infilms. The images in Figures 141 and 142 symbolise the dark, bleak, machine-likeworld of the robot-like Archons which they have worked to project into humansociety. This world has been portrayed in many feature films and other media andin the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.Archon WorldAnd so to the experiences of Dr Eben Alexander which happened in 2008 when hewas struck very suddenly by e-coli meningitis that began to eat away at hisbrain. They realised in the emergency room at the hospital that his brain andspinal fluid was awash with puss and his chances of survival were pretty muchzero. He would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life even if he hadby some miracle survived. The guy was done for – it was over. But while hisfamily sat by his bedside for the next seven days with Eben showing no signs oflife or Consciousness, he was on an incredible journey into the realms ofreality that he had always dismissed as fantasy. He and other academics, doctorsand scientists explain away the accounts by millions who have had similarnear-death experiences as creations of the brain responding to the neurologicalcircumstances, but that won’t wash in Eben Alexander’s case. The parts of hisbrain from which such ‘fantasies’ are supposed to spring were completely shutdown in those seven days, switched off, not working and couldn’t produce afantasy at any price. Only the most primitive parts of the brain werefunctioning and preventing him from crossing the line into fullblown ‘death’.Eben’s point of attention had been freed from the malfunctioning brain (Fig143). The first reality that he experienced outside the body was not nice atall. He describes this place in his book, Proof of Heaven, as like ‘visibledarkness’ and being submerged in mud yet also being able to see through it. Hehad a form of awareness, but no self-identity. He calls it the ‘Realm of theEarthworm’s Eye-View’ and New Agers use the term ‘lower astral’. I will callthis the Archontic realm for the purposes of this book. Eben heard the sound of‘rhythmic pounding’ that was distant, yet strong, a little like a heartbeat, but‘darker and more mechanical – like the sound of metal against metal, as if agiant subterranean blacksmith is pounding an anvil somewhere off in the distance... pounding so hard that the sound vibrates through the earth, or the mud, orwherever it is that you are.’ I suggest that what Eben is describing is therealm of the Archons from which the ‘Hack’, the fake copy ‘Earth’, is projectedand the realm where people end up after human death if they are in such a lowvibrational state that they can’t move through it (Fig 144). They will theneither stay there or reincarnate into the holographic expression of that realm –the fake copy Earth that we are experiencing. This is the journey taken manytimes by the Archon-Reptilian bloodlines manipulating human society and I willbe exposing them in detail later. A common theme of near-death experiences isthat people describe going through a tunnel to a bright light at the other endwhere they meet long-passed loved ones or other entities, and they experience areality full of love, bliss and joy (Fig 145). It is my feeling that this‘tunnel’ is a sort of vortex through which Awareness (points of attention) canmove with protection through the dense Archon range of frequency. Eben Alexanderdidn’t have the tunnel experience and instead ended up where he did. He said hewas fine with it at first because he describes himself in a sort of zombie statewhere he observed in a detached way through very limited awareness in which hehad no memory of anything – including the Earth-life from which had justdeparted:[../Images/00122.jpg]Figure 141: An Archon world depicted in the London Olympics opening ceremony.[../Images/00296.jpg]Figure 142: Archon world – dead, grim and without creativity.[../Images/00310.jpg]Figure 143: Incarnate Awareness – an incarnate point of attention – is releasedwhen the body dies or shuts down sufficiently for attention to be free of itssense of reality.[../Images/00244.jpg]Figure 144: Neil Hague’s version of the ‘Realm of the Earthworm’s Eye-View’ –the realm of the Archons.[../Images/00252.jpg]Figure 145: A high percentage of near-death experiencers speak of passingthrough a tunnel with a bright light at the end.> I wasn’t human while I was in this place. I wasn’t even animal. I was> something before, and below, all that. I was simply a lone point of awareness> in a timeless red-brown sea.But then he began to experience a return to some sort of self-awareness as thedetachment faded and now it became a scary place. He describes reptilian,wormlike creatures crowding past him and sometimes rubbing against him withtheir ‘smooth or spiky skins’. Faces bubbled up out of the darkness and becameugly and threatening. The pounding intensified and became like ‘the work-beatfor some army of troll-like underground workers’. He became aware of a smell –‘a little like faeces, a little like blood, and a little like vomit ... Abiological smell, in other words, but of biological death, not of biologicallife.’ This is the realm of the Demiurge-Archon-Reptilians who, like theirbloodline agents in our world, are obsessed with death, spilling blood, decayand suffering – all of which generate the low-vibrational energy on which theArchon-Reptilians feed within the realm that Eben Alexander describes.[../Images/00060.jpg]Figure 146: The most powerful satanic rituals in our reality are connecting withrituals happening in the Archon realm.This is where entities ‘haunting’ graveyards and other places of death reside.In frequency terms it is so close to our reality that interaction is possible –‘I saw a ghost’; ‘I saw a shadowy figure’. This is not the only explanation forghostly phenomena, but it is one of them. Satanic rituals connect with theentities in this realm, too, and the most powerful rituals can bring themthrough into our reality by means of the ‘stepping-stone’ energetic fields thatthe rituals are designed to generate (Fig 146). Arch British Satanist AleisterCrowley (1875-1947) experimented with a ritual in New York called the‘Amalantrah Working’ to create a vortex, or portal, through which entities couldmanifest. He claimed to have done this with an entity he referred to as ‘Lam’and his drawing of what he saw looked remarkably similar to what have becomeknown as Greys – one of the forms taken by Archons. L Ron Hubbard, the NavalIntelligence agent and founder of Scientology, is reported to have triedsomething similar with a ritual called the ‘Babalon Working’. The concept ofsacrifice ‘to the gods’ refers to entities – perceived as gods by ancientsocieties and modern Satanists – in Eben Alexander’s ‘Realm of the Earthworm’sEye – View’ from where they feed off the sacrificial energy of death and terror.The Archontic realm does not have a natural energetic power source because it ismachine-like and computer-like rather than conscious. It lacks creativeimagination and is so far removed from The All That Is that it must parasitizeoff those who do have energetic power – in this case humanity. This parasitizingcan be seen throughout human society, not least with the banking system whichappears to be sucking the population dry of money, but money is only a form ofenergy. What we are really seeing is the population being sucked dry of energy –life-force. This is one major reason why so many people worldwide feelconstantly fatigued and short of energy. Bankers don’t create anything – theyparasitize off the efforts of those that do by lending them ‘money’ that doesn’texist (‘credit’) and charging them interest on it. The outrageous demands bysocial networks like Facebook for copyright or joint copyright of anythingposted on their networks is another outstanding example of parasitizing off thecreative energy of the people, but list is endless. The Archons’ prime energysource is low vibrational human emotional energy such as fear, hatred, conflict,frustration, anxiety and depression which resonate within their own range offrequency and so can be absorbed as an energy source. I will explore thisfurther in the next chapter, but basically the more humanity can be manipulatedto generate the energy of fear, terror and death, the more power this realmabsorbs to recycle back against its human targets. Eben Alexander tells in hisbook how he heard dull roars that ‘changed into dim, rhythmic chants, chantsthat were both terrifying and weirdly familiar’. The rituals of the ‘human’Satanists are conducted at the same time by their masters in the Archon realmand together they establish the compatible vibrational channel through whichArchon entities can enter the rituals within our reality (Fig 147). It is alsothe case that large numbers of people calling themselves ‘psychics’ and‘mediums’ are accessing the Archontic realm and being fed manipulative andinaccurate nonsense. The best ones can expand their awareness to connect withmuch higher frequencies beyond the Archontic lunatic asylum.[../Images/00119.jpg]Figure 147: The most powerful satanic rituals in our reality areconnecting withrituals happening in the Archon realm.Beyond the Archon worldNow, before anyone succumbs to fear about all this – the Archontic ‘Hell’ is tothe rest of Infinity as a fly is to an elephant. The power of love is theall-powerful force, not hatred, not suffering, not ‘Hell’. Infinite Love is theonly truth – everything else is illusion. Yes, including and especially therealm and perceived power of the ‘dark side’. Power? You must be joking. Theironly power is our perception of their power and the perception that we don’thave any when we potentially have it all. As one quote I saw put it: ‘The mostcommon way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.’ I amnot going to spoil Eben Alexander’s book for people by going into the detail ofwhat happened next, but in brief summary he was ‘rescued’ from this Hell-likeplace when (perceived) light and love appeared in the form of a ‘girl’ to takehim through the ‘gateway’ and into an Infinity of love, joy, happiness andOneness. ‘It was the strangest, most beautiful world I’d ever seen’, he writes.‘I felt like I was being born. Not born again. Just ... born.’ You find thetheme of entities ‘guarding the gateways’ throughout the ancient world and yousee this built into esoteric architecture in the form of archways guarded bydemons, lions or other entities and symbols. Architecture, archways ... Archons.The place once known as Babylon, now Iraq, is a major interdimensional gatewayand this is why Mesopotamia was so important to the ‘gods’ and continues to be atarget for today’s global Control System working on behalf of the ‘gods’.Babylon was famous for its arched Ishtar Gate, named after the Babyloniangoddess Ishtar (from which we get ‘Easter’) and also known as Semiramis. Babylonis an ancient Greek name, but the location was earlier known as Babilli, whichmeans Gate of God or Gateway of the God. Once Eben Alexander was through thegateway out of ‘Hell’ (and what I would say was out of the Archon realm) he sawanother Earth with green, lush countryside, fantastically vibrant colour(reflecting its higher vibration) and with all the people happy and laughing,singing and dancing. This is ‘Earth’ as it really is beyond the fake-copyArchontic Hack that we are experiencing. Interestingly, many ancient peoplebelieved in three ‘heavens’ and you can find references in the Bible to this.The first heaven was for anything not attached to the Earth or ‘where the birdsfly’; the third was the ‘heaven of heavens’, the realm of ‘God’; and betweenthem was the second heaven which was described as like a war zone and the realmof Satan which included the surface of the Earth. This is what I am calling theworld of the Archons. Thomas A Horn writes is Nephilim Stargates:> This war zone is a sort of gasket heaven, the domain of Satan encompassing the> surface of the Earth. It was believed that from here powerful demons known as> kosmokrators could overshadow cities, intrude upon, and attempt to influence> the affairs and governments of men.> It was also believed that from the kosmos Satan’s minions sought to close the> gateways above cities so that God’s blessings could not flow to them. Later,> it was believed that when saints bent their knees in prayer, they had to pray> through the walls/gates of opposition within this basket heaven.This is precisely what I been describing about the relationship between theArchon realm, our reality and the greater infinity. For kosmokrators, read‘Archons’, and for ‘God’s blessings’, read ‘a connection with the higher levelsof awareness’. Closing the gateways refers to entrapping perception in thefive-sense Matrix and praying through walls/gates is opening your mind to higherfrequencies of awareness which bypass the Matrix. It is highly relevant thatmany religions speak of a ‘separation from God’ – a separation from the trueself. Eben Alexander was able to go down into the ‘Archon’ world and come out ofit at will once he had remembered his true power to dictate his reality andthere was no longer any fear about what he saw and experienced there. He was inthe power of his true self. He realised that the ‘physics’ of mainstream scienceare a nonsense. There was no time once he left his body and the answer came backsimultaneous to the question being asked. I know what he means – I haveexperienced that. Everything was One. I have long contended that ‘time’ is onlya decoded manipulation of the Hack, the fake-copy reality. This is what anothernear-death experiencer said:[../Images/00295.jpg]Figure 148: Eben Alexander’s ‘The Core’ or ‘dazzling darkness’ is what I havebeen referring to all these years as the All That Is.> ... everything from the beginning, my birth, my ancestors, my children, my> wife, everything comes together simultaneously. I saw everything about me, and> about everyone who was around me. I saw everything they were thinking now,> what they thought then, what was happening before, what was happening now.> There is no time, there is no sequence of events, no such thing as limitation,> of distance, of period, of place. I could be anywhere I wanted to be> simultaneously.This also describes Eben Alexander’s experience. He describes what he calls ‘TheCore’ or the ‘dazzling darkness’ from where the purest love emanated and whereall was known (Fig 148). I know what he means because I have been there, too,and this is what I call the All That Is – All Knowing, All Possibility. The‘girl’ who guided him out of the Archon realm manifested as an ‘orb’ andcommunicated to him through pure thought (all communication was telepathy notwords) the true reality of unconditional love. He was told:> You are loved and cherished.> You have nothing to fear.> There is nothing you can do wrong.‘Love is, without a doubt, the basis of everything,’ Eben writes:> Even on earth there is much more good than evil, but earth is a place where> evil is allowed to gain influence in a way that would be entirely impossible> at higher levels of existence. That evil could occasionally have the upper> hand was known and allowed by the Creator as a necessary consequence of giving> the gift of free will to beings like us.> Small particles of evil were scattered throughout the universe, but the sum> total of all that evil was as a grain of sand on a vast beach compared with> the goodness, abundance, hope and unconditional love in which the universe was> literally awash.> The very fabric of the alternate dimension is love and acceptance, and> anything that does not have these qualities appears immediately and obviously> out of place there.So many people – myself included – experience a lifetime in this manipulatedreality in which they feel a constant background of sadness. It is always there,mostly almost imperceptible, but it can be felt very tangibly in quiet momentsof reflection. This is the emotional aching and longing for the Infinity that wereally are and all the love, joy and happiness that goes with it. Well, thegreat news is that to this we shall return, but in the meantime we have a job todo to open the collective heart and mind of this ‘world’ and thus open the gatesto the love and awareness that will set us, and the Archons, free. EbenAlexander opened his eyes to the astonishment of doctors and family seven daysafter most of his brain ceased to function. He should have been dead, or atleast barely alive with the awareness of a vegetable. But he wasn’t. Once atransition period was completed when his brain rebooted he had the same brainand body that he did before he went away – though he was no longer the sameperson. How could such an ‘impossible’ miracle happen? Infinite Love Is The OnlyTruth – Everything Else Is Illusion. ‘Miracles’ and ‘mysteries’ are just otherwords for ignorance.Parallel universes ‘on’ the same ‘Earth’Those with minds closed to the greater reality are attached to the Archonticrealm while those with more expanded awareness are influenced by much higherlevels of perception. So we see these different states of awareness in the same‘world’ in similar human bodies, but their ‘Mission Controls’ are light yearsapart. The Demiurge/Archons are constantly trying to manipulate humans into lowvibrational mental and emotional states to capture the minds and perceptions ofthose that succumb and to target those with expanded awareness whom they fearwith a vengeance. There are what I call heart-people (expanded awareness);mind-people (five-sense intellectual ‘brain’ awareness); and gut-people(heartless, even mindless and completely under Archon control). Then there areothers who are mostly no longer perceiving reality through the body at all, butonly using it to allow direct interaction with the frequency range that theywish to experience (Fig 149). Their reality overwhelmingly does not come throughthe filter of the brain because their point of attention and awareness hasexpanded into deeper levels of the energetic self and their perception ofreality is constructed beyond the body and not through its programmed ‘lens’. Welive ‘in’ a world where multiple realities mingle together connected by onecommon factor – their attention is being focused on the same frequency band ofvisible light via the holographic biological body-computer. When you researchthe grotesque and despicable sub-world of paedophilia and Satanism, as I havenow for more than two decades, the multiple realities in the same ‘world’ are soclear to see. Good and evil do exist in that they are very different states ofperception, points of attention and self-awareness. Those behind the globalconspiracy and its paedophile and Satanic networks have their minds connectedto, and their perceptions driven by, what neurosurgeon Eben Alexander calls therealm of the ‘Earthworm’s Eye-View’ – the realm of ‘biological death, not ofbiological life’. This is the realm which is projecting into the psychopathicminds of the ‘Elite’ Archontic bloodlines and their gofers and agents withinroyalty, politics, banking, etc., and this is why they act with such evil andhatred and with no sense of empathy and compassion. The world they have longembarked upon creating in our reality is a mirror of their own and so our worldis becoming ever more ‘ugly and threatening’ – one based on ‘biological death,not biological life’.[../Images/00348.jpg]Figure 149: Same ‘world’, different sense of reality.This is the game: the more our reality mirrors the Archon reality the closerthey become in terms of frequency and the more power and influence the Archonrealm has over this one. Love, empathy, compassion and joy are therefore theanswer to all this. These states of being quicken the frequency of our realityand subsequently increase the vibrational ‘distance’ to the Archontic frequencyband. This dramatically reduces its influence on human perception and behaviour.It also removes the energetic power source of low-vibrational human emotion onwhich the Archon realm depends. Satanism performs its repeating rituals,including human and animal sacrifice, in the same locations month after month,year after year with the biggest rituals reserved for certain astrological(energetic) periods when they can be most powerful and effective from their sickpoint of view. This is the reason why periods of the year like Beltane andHalloween are most significant to the global satanic networks along with thesolstices and equinoxes. The rituals manipulate the energy field at the targetedlocations to make the frequency division between our realm and the Archon realmmuch thinner. This allows far more powerful interaction with the Archontic‘demons’ (‘The Devil’, ‘Satan’) and opens the way for them to enter our reality,albeit only for a certain time because of the vibrational and atmosphericincompatibility. So many Satanic rituals take place in churches because (a)churches were often built originally on vortex points on the Earth’s energy gridwhen they were located at places previously held sacred by the ‘Pagans’ who knewabout the energetic lines of force now called meridians or ley lines; and (b)churches are often surrounded by graveyards which constantly generate thefrequency of death and decay. Graveyards and cemeteries are targeted bySatanists because once again the energy of death and decay dilutes the frequencydivision between this realm and the Archon realm which Eben Alexander describedperfectly as being about biological death.Quite simply, the Archons and their bloodline representatives in our reality areobsessed with death because ‘death’ is the frequency of ‘home’. This is what Imean by parallel universes existing in the same ‘world’. For those notcontrolled by the Archon mentality death and destruction, wars and famine areterrible happenings; but to the Archontic ‘mind’ they are, as Boy Bush said:‘Mission accomplished’."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00480.jpg]The Emotion TrapDesire urges me on, while fear bridals me.Giordano BrunoI said earlier that before our reality was hijacked Earth was home to a ‘heart’society. The prime point of connection with the wider reality for pre-Hackpeople was through the heart vortex or chakra which provides access to innateintelligence and higher wisdom, intuition and knowing from beyond the fakeMatrix.You see how many people put their hand or hands on their chest when they saythings like ‘I just know.’ This is the subconscious awareness that it is fromthe heart that we do intuitively know. People will put their hand to their headwhen they say ‘I’m thinking’. Thought is a very basic state of awarenesscompared with knowing or, put another way, the heart is far more aware than thehead, or brain. Thus, the head has to think (trying to work things out) whilethe intuitive heart knows how things are. When someone feels intuition theywill, as an example, just know that they have go to a particular place at aparticular time, while the head wants to know why, what the consequences mightbe, how much it will cost and what will others say if they do so. The heartdoesn’t need any of that. It just knows and off you go. The head constantlyblocks and gets in the way of the knowing heart with its ‘risk-assessments’ andlists of potential consequences, but if you go with your intuition no matterwhat your head is screaming the adventure begins. I have followed my intuitiveknowing unceasingly since my initial awakening in 1990 and it has presented mewith many challenges, for sure. Intuitive knowing comes from a level ofawareness beyond the Matrix and the Archon frequency range and so views ourreality from a very different perspective to the in-the-Matrix head/mind which,without the heart and expanded awareness, is a puppet of the Archontic realitydescribed by Eben Alexander. The intuitive heart will guide you to do and saythings that the Matrix-bound majority will see as crazy, wrong, even dangerousto ‘society’ (the norms). This will bring ridicule and condemnation from the‘all-knowing’ majority who believe that only they (the system) know best. Thearrogance of ignorance, the arrogance of stupidity, knows no bounds. But if youfollow intuition no matter what others say or think you find that it all worksout in the end if what you were feeling was genuinely intuitive. After a while,and despite the challenges, the five-sense perception of the ‘head’ realisesthat if you follow your heart everything comes right in due course and it comesright not despite the challenges that were faced, but because of them. I amcertainly whatever I am today because of the challenges that I have experiencedand not despite them. They have made me infinitely stronger emotionally andmentally and a great deal wiser than I was before they happened. There comes apivotal point when the head sees the pattern and concedes its desire fordominance and instead seeks harmony with the heart. It ceases to be a nagging,disrupting force at war with the heart and intuition and the two begin to worktogether as one unit. Today when my intuition says do something, my head says‘Okay, let’s go’. They’re pals, not enemies. The head alone will never discoverthe deeper levels of the rabbit hole and the illusion. This can only be donethrough the intelligence and knowing of the heart in harmony with the head. TheArchons are fully aware of this and their major target after the hijack was theheart vortex and suppressing its power, influence and connection with thegreater ‘self’. They wanted humans focussed in the head and the gut and this iswhat happens when the heart’s influence on perception is diminished. I’ll gointo this more deeply in a moment.The bunk about ‘junk’The Demiurge (‘Lord Archon’) and the Archons could only change and twist thehuman form so much because they had to work with what was already there. Theydid not create the human body from scratch – they distorted and manipulated whatexisted before. It is said by some researchers and even a few on the fringes ofthe scientific field that humans once had twelve active strands of DNA and notthe two that we have today. Imagine the potential range of frequencies and thescale of information/data that twelve strands of DNA could decode and processcompared with two. This certainly fits with my contention that geneticmanipulation dramatically narrowed the band of frequency that humans couldperceive (decode). I say that an enormous amount of information within what hasbeen ludicrously termed ‘junk’ DNA has also been switched off along with DNAconnections to other dimensions of reality to imprison us in ignorance andmyopia. This can be done by targeting RNA which writes the DNA program and canswitch genetic functions on and off. The process connects with what is calledepigenetics and also histone proteins around which DNA wraps itself. Togetherthese can fundamentally change genetic function and expression. Mike Lambert atthe Shen Clinic said:> There are rarely single genes that cause a given disease; it’s more often> interactions between a number of genes that’s heavily influenced by> environmental factors. Histone codes are flexible and have the capacity to act> as an interface between genome and environment.This has fantastic implications for the world we live in because it means thatwhat is unleashed into the environment in terms of toxic food, drink, chemicals,drugs, radiation etc., can change the human form by triggering RNA andepigenetic-histone responses that change the DNA program. What mainstreamscience misses as it focusses on the holographic ‘twigs’ (the connections andinfluences that appear to be ‘physical’) is that RNA, DNA, histones andepigenetics are all waveform/energetic in their base form and it is at thatlevel that the real communication and subsequent change occurs. As much as 98percent of DNA was dubbed junk or non-coding because mainstream science had noidea what it does. They said that it has no discernible function. The very ideathat 98 percent of human DNA is there for no reason breaches the walls ofinsanity. So the question is not ‘does it do anything?’, but ‘what does it do?’One group of mainstream scientists finally agreed with what some of us have beensaying for years – that ‘junk’ DNA does have a function. No, really, honestly?More than 400 scientists in 32 laboratories around the world announced that ‘afar larger chunk of our genetic code is biologically active than previouslythought’. You don’t say. How could they have ever believed that this wouldn’t bethe case? It is stunning to me. Dr Ewan Birney from the European BioinformaticsInstitute in Cambridge said: ‘The term junk DNA must now be junked.’ The studyfound that at least four million active gene ‘switches’ in ‘junk’ DNA (which acta little like dimmer switches) and that even tiny changes in these switchescaused by ‘environmental exposure’ can lead to disease and other adverseeffects. Here we go ... all this impacts upon RNA, histone proteins and theprocess known as epigenetics and so brings changes in DNA. This is whatadditives and poisons in food, genetically-modified crops, radiation, and allthe now endless sources of environmental pollution are doing – triggering theseresponses within non-coding DNA as part of a cold and calculated mass-cull thatI will be exposing in detail later when the process of epigenetics will becrucial to understanding why we are living in such an engineered toxicenvironment. The global study found that ‘junk’ DNA has ‘a sort of DNA wiringsystem that is almost inconceivably intricate.’ Mark Gerstein, a member of theresearch team, said: ‘It is like opening a wiring closet and seeing a hairballof wires.’ Yes, and it does far more than any scientist has even begun toconceive. Scientists at the Wyss Institute at Harvard Medical School say thatall the data created by humanity in a year could be stored in four grams of DNAand so imagine the scale of information that exists within the entirety of humanDNA which is only a holographic projection of a waveform energetic code. TheWyss study encoded the contents of a book within DNA and copied it 70 billiontimes and it came only to the size of a thumbnail. I explained in Remember WhoYou Are why I say that a key part of the genetic tinkering was to insertbehavioural and emotional biological software programs into what is called‘junk’, or non-coding, DNA, to replace those that were suppressed or switchedoff altogether. In other words, they created a new human ‘personality’controlled by implanted emotional programs which would drive all human behaviourunless people overrode the program by opening their Body-Mind to Awarenessbeyond the Matrix to which the program is connected.The people I call ‘real’ scientists who have a genuine desire for discoveryoutside the box and off the song sheet realised long ago the obvious fact thatjunk DNA does have a function and they have produced some very relevantfindings. A research team at Boston University and Harvard Medical Schoolexamined 37 DNA sequences containing at least 50,000 base pairs and one with 2.2million base pairs and lead researcher Eugene Stanley said that non-coding DNAsequences do contain ‘a structured language fundamentally unlike the coding ingenes [the remaining two to three percent of coding DNA] ... we therefore needto consider the possibility that “the junk” DNA may carry some kind of message.’Too right it does, as I have been saying for years. The team investigating thislanguage within junk DNA employed the work of linguist George Kingley Zipf(1902-1950) who identified a remarkable sequence within human languages. Hefound that how frequently words appear in a language follows an identifiablesequence. For example, Zipf discovered that the most common word in the Englishlanguage occurs ten times more than tenth most used word and 100 times moreoften than the 100th most used word. He identified the same recurring sequencesin all the languages that he researched. The Boston-Harvard team found that asimilar sequence was encoded within junk or non-coding DNA and that thisfollowed the Zipf sequence far more precisely and overwhelmingly than the twopercent of coding DNA, which basically didn’t follow it at all. They discoveredthat coding DNA (in genes) was appropriately a code, like software is aspecifically written code, while the 98 percent called junk DNA was a languagethat in so many ways expressed the behaviour of human languages. But what arehuman languages? They are vibrational/waveform phenomena generated from thevocal chords which we decode into what we experience as spoken words. The sameapplies to written words which are also waveform in their base state and thewords that you are ‘seeing’ (decoding) at this moment are only holographicexpressions of that waveform state. This is why the derivation of words is soimportant. As words beget words in other languages they may sound different, butthe same base vibration (meaning, information) is passed on. Language is aprogram. A multi-discipline Russian team, led by Pjotr Garjajev, found the samelanguage theme in their study of genetics. Garjajev said:> In order to achieve success in our attempts to treat medical problems and curb> the process of human aging, it is clearly necessary to understand the> languages by which cells communicate. [Human bodies are specifically> programmed to age – there is no ‘natural’ reason for this to happen.] To some> extent, those of us who have pioneered the field of ‘wave-genetics’ have> managed to accomplish this.> It appears that the languages we were looking for exist, in fact, in the 98> percent, or ‘junk’ DNA contained in our own genetic apparatus. The foundation> principle of these genetic languages is similar to the language of holographic> images as well as texts constructed from human speech.This must be so given that the body is a hologram.Spoken/written DNAEugene Stanley of the Boston-Harvard team is quoted as saying of the Zipf/DNAconnection ... ‘there’s no rhyme or reason why that should be true’. Oh, but Ithink there is and very much so, in fact. DNA is also a waveform phenomenon –everything is in this reality – and so at that level the two can communicate(Fig 150). The language within non-coding DNA can therefore become the languagethat is spoken – vibrated – and written – vibrated – by humans. Now, recall whatI said about how psychics tune into electromagnetic and waveform informationfields and decode them into their own language. An English psychic will decodethem into English, a Spanish psychic into Spanish and so on. The principle withjunk or non-coding DNA is the same. This contains the encoded blueprintinformation fields of human language and that is decoded in to differentexpressions (languages) of the same blueprint language within non-coding DNA.Thus, George Zipf discovered the same sequences in all the languages that heinvestigated. All the ancient accounts about God (the gods) forcing humans tospeak different languages to divide and rule them by blocking their ability tocommunicate are based on fact. The biblical story of the Tower of Babel(Babylon) is the most famous one, but the same theme can be found all over theworld. The external expressions of human languages were multiplied by theArchons to scramble communication between peoples and destroy the previousglobal communication of the ‘Avatar’ Earth; but these many and various ‘tongues’were and are only multiple versions of the same blueprint language encodedwithin ‘junk’ DNA. They sound different to the ear, but they come from the samewaveform blueprint. The Russian research team led by Pjotr Garjajev establishedthat DNA can be reprogrammed by words and frequencies (same thing) and this isso relevant to my contention that scrambling original language also involvedre-writing the language blueprint within junk/non-coding DNA. All spoken andwritten languages that followed from this new blueprint were now operating on adifferent frequency to the high-vibrational global language which went beforeand other communication that was overwhelmingly telepathic. This new frequency,generated by every spoken and written word in all languages (the same waveformblueprint), is being decoded by DNA to form a feedback loop. The DNA languageblueprint generates the language which is broadcast by the vocal chords and bythe written word. This waveform information is then decoded by DNA to form thefeedback loop – a vibrational Alcatraz (Fig 151). Round and round we go like ahamster’s wheel in a closed system of programmed RNA/DNA forever reprogrammingRNA/DNA via the waveform medium of language. We live in a prison of words andother frequencies or repeating waveform sequences of information. I haveemphasised over the years how obsessed the Control System is with language andhow it is very precise in the way that key documents are worded and key speechesand announcements are structured in their language. This is why. They know thatwords are waveform information fields and every word is a different frequency –not only the word itself, but the manner in which it is delivered and the intentbehind it.[../Images/00051.jpg]Figure 150: Language is merely decoded energetic states.[../Images/00146.jpg]Figure 151: The vibrational prison we call language.The Chinese I-Ching, or Book of Changes, relates to the human genetic code,which is why the I-Ching has 64 hexagrams or kua and the genetic code has 64codons (the basic building blocks from which all ‘physical’ life is said tomanifest). There are many other confirmations that have been identified byresearchers and experts to connect the I-Ching to DNA sequencing and it confirmsthat the ancient Chinese, or whoever gave them the IChing codes, had a completeunderstanding of DNA with the potential to manipulate it (Fig 152). China, ofcourse, is closely associated with the serpent or dragon gods – theArchon-Reptilians. The Ogham (pronounced owam) is the sacred Druidic alphabetand has major similarities to the IChing with its ‘line’ format that matches thetheme of the 64 I-Ching hexagrams or symbols made up of six broken or unbrokenlines based on the theme of yin and yang – positive-negative, male-female,polarities (Fig 153). Polarities are the Matrix, the Hack. Hinduism from theReptilian/Nagas-inspired Indus Valley has a major deity called Lord Shiva who issaid to have 64 forms. Shiva is claimed ‘to have notice of everything thathappens in the world’ and be ‘the main aspect of life’. Some researchers haveconnected the language of DNA to the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets and claim thathydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon (the basic elements of DNA) can be foundencoded in these alphabets and spell their name for God. I have seen thisexpressed as some divine plan of ‘God’, or a secret code from ‘our Creator’, ora ‘higher power’. I strongly disagree with the association between geneticallyrewired humans and some benevolent force. A ‘plan’ has been encoded in DNA andthis has been my contention for quite a while; but there is nothing ‘divine’about it and ‘God’ is actually the ‘gods’ – the Archons. They are not a‘Creator’, either, but manipulators and distorters of what was already created.The original Hebrew alphabet (another version of the DNA blueprint) consists of22 letters. Each has been given a number and is said to have a unique sound. Theforce that created these ancient languages (the same language in differentforms) knew that the universe has a waveform level (sound/vibration) and adigital level (numbers) and that one is an expression of the other. So a letterwas considered to be a sound and a number, and to be a creative force. ‘In thebeginning was the Word’, as Genesis puts it. There is also a holographicexpression of the same information and remember what Pjotr Garjajev of theRussian research team said about the language discovered in DNA: ‘The foundationprinciple of these genetic languages is similar to the language of holographicimages as well as texts constructed from human speech.’ He said that the basicprinciple of these DNA languages ‘is similar to the language of holographicimages based on principles of laser radiations of the genetic structures whichoperate together as a quasi-intelligent system ...’ Yes, a perceptionprogramming system – the Matrix.[../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 152: The I-Ching.[../Images/00232.jpg]Figure 153: The Ogham alphabet of the DruidsSame blueprint wherever you goI visited Tiwanaku (also Tiahuanaco) in Bolivia in 2012. This is an ancient sitejust across the border from Peru and now mostly in ruins. I found it to be astrange and very unpleasant place and I will describe what happened there alittle later. But in this region the Amara people speak a language that IvanGuzman de Rojas, a Bolivian computer scientist, said in the 1980s was akin to aspecifically structured and rigid software language which could be simplytranslated into algorithm computer language and used as a ‘bridge’ to translatebetween human languages. The Amara attribute the language to an ancient peopleknown as the Viracochas who apparently called themselves ‘The Sons of the Sun’.The Viracochas are believed in legend to have built the incredible structures atTiwanaku and at Sacsayhuaman, high above the city of Cuzco in Peru, where stonesof extraordinary size and weight were put together with amazing precision (Fig154). Legends say that the Viracochas had a ruler known as the serpent godQuetzalcoatl or Kukulkan by the Aztecs and Mayans in Central America and byother names elsewhere. This deity was called Viracocha in South America and ‘he’is often described as being a tall white man with blue eyes and a long reddishbeard and hair. Many scholars have doubted this description and suggested thatit is an invention of Spanish colonialists. The best known Creation story in theAndes says that Viracocha appeared from the waters of Lake Titicaca which spansthe Peruvian-Bolivian border and brought forth light. He went on to create theSun, Moon, and stars and breathed into stones to make a race of brainless humangiants. He destroyed them with a flood and then had another go using smallerstones to create better humans. Viracocha was closely associated with the seaand water (like Enki of the Sumerian Anunnaki, and the brothers Wowane andMpanku of the Zulu Chitauri) and the name apparently means ‘sea foam’. He wasalso known as the feathered serpent god, as with his depictions as Quetzalcoatl,Kukulkan and many others in Central and South America. Viracocha is depicted onthe so-called Sun Gate at Tiwanaku in Bolivia in his common pose holdingsnake-like thunderbolts in his hands (Fig 155). The serpent-worshipping peopleof what is now Central and South America originally came from Mu/Lemuria, thesame origin as the Nagas, the human-serpent shapeshifting hybrids in Asia.Researcher Michael Mott says of the Nagas in Caverns, Cauldrons, and ConcealedCreatures:[../Images/00363.jpg]Figure 154: The giant stones perfectly put together at Sacsayhuaman in Peru.[../Images/00379.jpg]Figure 155: Viracocha symbolised at Tiwanaku.> The Nagas are described as a very advanced race or species, with a> highly-developed technology [the technology theme is there yet again]. They> also harbor a disdain for human beings, whom they are said to abduct, torture,> interbreed with, and even to eat. The interbreeding has supposedly led to a> wide variety of forms, ranging from completely reptilian to nearly-human in> appearance.> Among their many devices are ‘death rays’ and ‘vimana’, or flying, disk-shaped> aerial craft. These craft are described at length in many ancient Vedic texts,> including the Bhagavad-Gita and the Ramayana. The Naga race is related to> another underworld race, the Hindu demons, or Rakshasas.

The constantthemes are undeniable and I will now pull all of this together.Real human ‘history’I am saying that the Archons and associated groups transformed the way thathumans interacted with reality. This interaction had once been through the heartand what is called ‘love’, although the true meaning of that has long been lostto most people. This ‘love’ is not ‘physical’ or chemical attraction; it is astate of high vibrational and no-vibrational balance that connects us to vastlymore expanded realms of Consciousness where we can access innate intelligenceand intuitive knowing – the true and eternal self. The Archons cannot cope withthat level of vibration, never mind manipulate, control and exploit it (Fig156). They had to change our prime point of interaction and perception from theheart chakras to the emotional chakras in the belly and just below. These arethe solar plexus and sacral chakras which I will refer to from this point as the‘belly chakras’ to keep it simple (Fig 157). The goal of .the hijack of humanperception was to move the focus of attention to the belly chakras and make themvibrate to the frequency of low-vibrational emotion. I have heard it said thatthere are only two types of emotion – fear and love – and that all others arevarious expressions of these two. I don’t agree for one simple reason. I don’tregard love in its true sense to be an emotion, but our prime state to which wealways eventually return. It is like a default state. You can work on a computerand go here, there and everywhere on the hard drive and Internet, but when it’sall finished and you reboot or turn the computer off and on again the defaultstate is restored. For humans, and indeed all existence, I say that ‘reboot’state is the one of balance and expanded awareness that we call love – in thesense of unconditional or Infinite Love. The Gnostics called this ‘Agape’ – thelove that knows we are all expressions of the same One. The voice in Brazilsaid: ‘Infinite Love is the only truth – everything else is illusion’. InfiniteIs-ness is the only truth and even the ‘Infinite’ bit is too defining, but ithelps the human mind to perceive the difference between the world that we thinkwe see and the greater reality. Low-vibrational emotion is illusion and it hasbeen specially encoded into our waveform structure (‘junk’ DNA) to enslave us.Take away human emotion based on the foundation state of fear and all that isleft is the true self – the Is-ness that is love.[../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 156: Heart people are untouchable by the Archons and have to bemanipulated by events into Body-Mind states of awareness.[../Images/00346.jpg]Figure 157: The Archon Matrix and its effect on human society is designed pullpeople out of heart awareness and into the belly by manipulating people intolow-vibrational emotional states.I will speak of the Archons and their representatives in the human realm asbeing incapable of feelings like compassion and empathy, but these are lessemotions and more expressions of the true self – the omnipotent love describedbeyond this world and the Archon realm by Eben Alexander. Think about where thefeeling comes from when you are expressing empathy and compassion – the centreof the chest or heart chakra. Where do we feel fear and its associated emotions?The belly. This is then transferred to the heart as what we call heartache –shutting down the heart chakra. I have also heard it said that emotion directlyaffects DNA and the number of DNA antenna that are activated and I agree; but itis not emotion alone that does this. Emotion can do it, and most certainly does,but only because emotion generates a frequency that affects DNA. Love is also afrequency at our level of reality, but it is not an emotion. Chemicalattraction, or Mind-Love, as I call it, may be an emotion, but not love in itspurest sense. Technological frequencies that are designed specifically tomanipulate human DNA are not emotions either, as with the HAARP technology inAlaska and elsewhere which bounces high-powered radio waves off the ionospherein the upper atmosphere and back to Earth and our DNA receiver system.Frequencies that change and affect DNA come from countless sources. There is anenormous difference between the effect that the frequency of love (heart chakra)has on DNA and that of low-vibrational emotion – all expressions of thefoundation state of fear. These include worry, anxiety, frustration, depression,guilt, hatred, aggression etc. The heart (love) frequency is a short, quick,wavelength, while the wavelengths of the belly chakras when manipulated intostates of fear are long, low and slow. The love wavelength therefore activatesfar more DNA antenna with its short wavelength because it strikes more points onDNA. The fear wavelength, being much longer and further apart, does the opposite(Fig 158). So the frequency of the heart expands our awareness (how muchinformation we can decode) while fear and company suppress and imprison it. Thesolar plexus chakra is the seat of anger and so the angrier we can bemanipulated to be the more our focus of attention is locked in the belly. Thisis why we live in such an angry world. The lower belly chakra, the sacralchakra, is also the focus of sexuality and this has been systematicallydistorted by a combination of suppression (it’s ‘dirty and immoral’) and theemphasis on ‘physical’ sexuality and not heart sexuality (‘Cor, I’d give ‘erone’). These mixed messages are constantly communicated to create energeticchaos (distortion) in the belly chakras that relate to emotion and sexuality.People are told to ‘go out and get it’ by the sexual images that dominatesociety today while other messages tell us: ‘Oh, no you mustn’t, what will thePope say?’ This has set these emotional states at energetic war with each other– what I call the ‘do it/don’t do it’ technique (Fig 159).[../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 158: Heart awareness quickens the frequency and head/belly awarenessslows it down.[../Images/00518.jpg]Figure 159: Energetic mayhem ... we tell you to do it and then to be ashamed.DNA programs – the ‘Second Soul’The genetic manipulators set out to change Earth people from heart-centred toemotion-centred and transfer their prime point of interaction with reality(point of prime attention) from the centre of the chest, as we experience it, tothe belly. They have worked to keep us there ever since and human society isspecifically structured to that end. This is of immense significance to why ourworld is a bollocks factory to the universe. I outlined earlier how theInstitute of HeartMath in the United States established that when theelectromagnetic field of the heart is in harmony and coherent connection withthose of the brain and the central nervous system a person enters a far moreexpanded state of Awareness. The energetic heart must be in electromagneticcoherence (balance, harmony) for this to happen or the ‘trinity’ circuit isbroken and the head takes over perception and decision-making in conjunctionwith the belly chakras – low vibrational emotion. This draws perception intopurely five-sense reality and the pig is on the spit, the hamster on the wheel.I have just described most of the human race still today and for aeons past inour perception of time. Decisions are made and reactions triggeredoverwhelmingly from an emotional response and point of attention andobservation. The heart’s energetic field becomes more incoherent when thishappens and we are pulled deeper into the emotional mire of low-vibrationalignorance. Look at the effect of the heart’s electromagnetic coherence ofdifferent states of being (Fig 160). The pre-eminence of emotion over heart hasbeen seriously aided and abetted by biological emotional and perceptionalsoftware programs encoded into non-coding or ‘junk’ DNA. These programs aredriving human perception of reality and the emotional reactions to thoseperceptions. So much so, it is my view that most humans go through an entirelifetime in this reality without having a single original thought or emotionalresponse which has not been generated by the programs and this fake perceptionis constantly underpinned and further ingrained by the institutions of‘society’, most notably ‘education’ and media. Credo Mutwa told me about theAfrican legend of the evil goddess Watamaraka. She is said to have given humansa ‘second soul’ – the ‘secret serpent spirit’ – and it is known as the ‘doubletongue of the python’. Legends say that the serpent soul is hiding within thehuman body and ‘makes people do horrible things that they would not normallydo’, as Credo put it. ‘The serpent soul also manipulates people to think thattheir horrible actions are justified’, he told me. This ‘second soul’ couldrefer to outright possession, but given that the legend applies to humanity ingeneral it is highly likely that it refers to the universal possession ofprogrammed DNA. Native American legend speaks of humans having two wolves insidethem (Fig 161). One is ‘good’ and is expressed as love, joy, peace, hope,serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth andcompassion. The other is ‘evil’ and gives us hatred, anger, envy, sorrow,regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, falsepride, superiority and ego. ‘Which wolf wins?’ the legend asks? And it answers:the one you feed the most (Fig 162). The modus operandi of the Archons is tomanipulate and structure human perception and society (collective perception) toensure that their ‘wolf’ wins. By doing so, humanity is held in five-sense(Matrix) servitude and the Archons can feed off a constant tidal wave of humanlow-vibrational emotion. New Agers talk about having a ‘shadow self’ and‘mastering the shadow self’ as if having a ‘dark side’ is perfectly natural. Icould hardly disagree more. The shadow side of humans is anything but ‘natural’.It has been genetically embedded to make humans perceive and act in ways thatsuit the agenda of the Archons.[../Images/00390.jpg]Figure 160: Human society has been specifically structured and manipulated toclose down the heart.[../Images/00300.jpg]Figure 161: The inner battle that only the heart can win.[../Images/00446.jpg]Figure 162: Human life in the Matrix.We are the Infinity of All Possibility and yet humanity operates within a tinybubble or box of possibility and potential for self-creation. Psychologists havesuggested that human personalities can be broken down into around twelve majorarchetypes and combinations of them. How can that be if we are expressinganything like the true self of All Possibility? It can’t. But what can createarchetypal personality programs and combinations of them? Computers and softwareprograms. Body-Mind computers are encoded with the programs and duringprocreation different programs (personality traits) are downloaded to the nextand subsequent generations. These programs explain why no matter where you arein the world and no matter what the cultural or religious situation that you areobserving, you can pretty much predict how most people will respond in the samesituation – the same as you know when you type data into a computer what isgoing to happen when you press enter. This is another closed loop with theperception program triggering responses from the emotion program and the loopbeing completed by the emotion program influencing the sense of self and realityof the perception program. DNA is, in effect, programming itself once this loopis activated. It’s another hamster’s wheel (Fig 163). There is even a stateknown as the ‘hamster’s wheel brain’ which describes a situation where yourbrain goes on and on about something without getting anywhere and won’t shut up.The constant chatter in your head and all the possible scenarios that it keepsconstructing all day and when you are trying to sleep is the perception (mental)program running. IT IS NOT THE TRUE YOU. The programs will observe a situationor merely think of one and then immediately construct a story relating to it.The fake imposter ‘you’ (the program) might think of someone you don’t like andaway we go – ‘If she says this to me, I’ll say that to her ... if he brings upwhat I did to him, I list all the things he’s done to me ...’ Hey, hold on asecond. She and he haven’t said it or done it, so what are you going on about?It’s all happening in your own mind. It is the perception program, not the realyou. Notice, too, that when these perception scenarios are running you begin tofeel emotions related to their fictional tales and projected outcomes, and thesame when you think about something you don’t like, be it spiders, flying orgoing to the dentist. The two programs are designed to work as one unit, eachsupporting and empowering the other. Sit quietly and just observe the chatter inyour head and the emotions generated by that in your belly. Then ask yourselfwho is doing the observing? Who is it? ‘It’ is the real you which is observingwhat is being generated by the Body-Mind programs – the fake ‘you’. It iscrucial to the survival, let alone success, of the Control System that humanscontinue to self-identify with the programs and not the true self. Human societyis once again specifically structured and manipulated to achieve that end. Thepredators have also structured human experience to supply a constant and endlessflow of situations (data) to activate the emotion programs within non-coding DNAin the form of war, personal conflicts, suffering, hunger, tragedy and trauma ofevery kind, and this has relocated the human point of attention overwhelminglyfrom the heart chakra to the emotional chakra in the belly. The onceheart-centred society has been diluted and distorted to become belly-centred(Fig 164). I often hear the phrase ‘what does your heart tell you?’ supersededby ‘what does your gut tell you?’ Subservience to the perception and emotionalprograms locks the Body-Mind decoding systems into the very frequency range ofthe fake reality – the Matrix – which operates within the low-vibrationalemotional band.[../Images/00558.jpg]Figure 163: Brain chatter.[../Images/00158.jpg]Figure 164: Point of attention and interaction from the heart to the belly.Decoding our own prisonAnother fake perception source is encoded within ‘junk’ DNA – memory. Doeshumanity have memories of what has happened in the ‘past’ (given there is nosuch thing as time) or are they coming from the encoded false memories withinour genetic structure? People talk about genetic memory and I am saying thatthis is a profound truth on many more levels than those currently perceived. Ifthey can encode the ‘past’ then they can encode the ‘future’ (both illusions ofmanufactured ‘time’). I say that this is what they are doing. The collectiveprogram for human enslavement has been encoded in human ‘junk’ DNA and elsewhereand we are decoding our own Orwellian nightmare from that blueprint. Thissequence has to be broken or we will complete the job. The Archons cannot createdirectly from nothing. They can only manipulate, twist and piggy-back what isalready created. What they have had to do is program the perceptions of humanityand manipulate the human creative force to do everything for them. Theinformation field encoded with the unfolding of the ever-more brutal and extremeControl System has been implanted as a biological software program within theMatrix/human DNA and this is being strengthened every day by the control ofmainstream information that humanity is accepting as reality. This is whyOrwell’s world in all its countless facets is being introduced with such amazingspeed and synchronicity across such an enormous swathe of subject areas andlocations. Humans are decoding the agenda for human control like a laser reads aDVD, and the information on the ‘disc’ is becoming holographic reality in thosefew cubic centimetres at the back of brain where visual ‘reality’ isconstructed. The stream of Holywood films and television shows depicting theOrwellian world that the Archons want to impose are designed to trigger theprograms within human DNA to manifest that very world. It is known as‘predictive programming’ but I would say that ‘activation programming’ would bemore accurate. Even those who are more aware and challenge the system,especially those doing so only from the five-sense perspective of Body-Mind, areunknowingly bringing the Control System into being while, at the same time,seeking to challenge what they are unconsciously making manifest. Protestingagainst violence violently is a good example. I guess you could call this theultimate schizophrenia. But once you operate from the frequency of the heart theMatrix loses its influence because it cannot access that level of resonance andthe energetic source of the heart is far more powerful than the Matrix, anyway.Heart and belly – a personal experienceThere is another aspect to this emotion trap, too, which I have alreadymentioned, but it is worth expanding on the theme because it is so central tohuman life and how it is lived. The Archons feed off low-vibrational humanemotional energy and it is a power source for them both to absorb for themselvesand to empower the Matrix. Humans think that they eat ‘physical’ food, but theydon’t. They are consuming – absorbing – holographic food which is only a decodedwaveform information field. The Archons feed directly from waveform energy. TheMorpheus character was speaking a profound truth in the first Matrix movie whenhe held up a battery and said: ‘The Matrix is a computer-generated dream worldbuilt to keep us under control in order to change the human being into this.’Vital to that goal are the emotional reaction programs within ‘junk’ DNA whichensure a constant supply of low-vibrational emotional energy within the Archonfrequency range. The Archons have structured human society to be a giganticpower station for this energy by possessing and mind-parasitizing their targetsand directing their representatives within our reality to direct society in linewith their agenda. The Archons are the origin of all the vampire legends andstories, but they vampire human energy as well as blood (which is a form ofenergy anyway that carries the human genetic code). I had an experience on myreturn to Peru and Bolivia in 2012 that provided a simple and telling example ofthe difference between being heart-centred and belly-centred. The group fromaround the world and I crossed the border into Bolivia near the end of the tripto visit the ancient site of Tiwanaku which I have mentioned already. The energyin Bolivia and especially Tiwanaku was anything but heart-centred. If anyonebelieves that human thought and emotion does not imprint itself upon thecollective energy field they should cross the border between Peru and Bolivia onthe road to Tiwanaku. It was like entering another dimension (Hell) as youwalked across the river bridge between the countries. Peru touched you in theheart chakra while the Bolivian side hit you right in the belly – the emotionalchakra. Pretty much everyone in the group felt the same – ugh! The Bolivianuniforms at the border reflected this energy just as the energy reflected them.All had recently returned from hospital after undergoing humour-bypass surgery.It took ages for the simple process of a group of multi-national tourists togain entry to the country for a matter of hours. The border town on the Bolivianside was filthy with litter strewn everywhere and the 40 minute journey from theborder to Tiwanaku involved the bus stopping at two more ‘security checks’ – oneby the police and the other by the military – and the same on the way back. Ifanyone is predicting a police state coming to Bolivia they are already way toolate. I found Tiwanaku to be a horrible place energetically. I have felt thisvibe in many places around the world – all of them connected to human sacrifice,what would be called today Satanic ritual, and, in my view, connected toArchontic/reptilian / demonic energy. The group felt the same ‘belly’ energy atTiwanaku. We travelled through Peru visiting ‘heart’ places and the demeanour ofthe group reflected that. Their point of interaction with reality – for mostanyway – was the heart vortex. There was lots of laughter, optimism and joy(heart chakra) – until the day we crossed the border into Bolivia and arrived atTiwanaku (low-vibrational belly chakra). The difference in the energy and thedemeanour of the group was so obvious to me that I asked people to speak on thebus home about the changes they had felt that day. Mark, a lovely guy fromIreland, described how he had been so happy and at peace with everything untilhe had experienced Tiwanaku. He said that he then suddenly became angry andill-tempered and felt like shouting abuse at anyone who got in his way whentaking a picture. This phenomenon is so crucial to understanding the conspiracyand human behaviour that words can hardly describe it. We are at the coal-faceof human control here. I had been aware of this for a long time, but passingthrough Peru from heart centre to heart centre and then experiencing alow-vibrational emotional centre at Tiwanaku made it all so crystal clear. Theeffect on mental state and behaviour was blatant. ‘Open your heart’ and ‘comefrom the heart’ are not some trite New Age mantras (though they can be if youdon’t know what a profound truth is being spoken). Open your heart means openingthe vibrational door to freedom.The lizard in your headThere is another crucial genetic connection to human control. This is thereptilian brain, or what some scientists call the R-complex, and it has a prime,indeed primal, impact on human perception and behaviour. It is not only mesaying this, either. Even the ‘scientific’ mainstream accepts this to be true.One major expression of the Archons takes a reptilian form, as the Gnosticsdescribed 2,000 years ago, and reptilian genetics are very computer-like. Thisfurther supports the computer-like descriptions of the Archons in general foundin the Gnostic Nag Hammadi texts. The so-called Greys have the same reputationfor being emotionless software programs. It is my view that the reptilian brainwithin the human brain either wasn’t there before the genetic hijack, or it isfar bigger and more influential than it was before (Fig 165). The introductionof the reptilian brain allowed Archon-Reptilian mind-patterns to infiltrate thehuman psyche even more effectively. Mainstream science says that the reptilianbrain represents a major centre of the nervous system, and produces charactertraits like aggressive and ritualistic behaviour, territoriality, and a desirefor social hierarchies. Other traits of the reptilian brain include obsessivecompulsive behaviour (addictions of all kinds), superstition, conforming tonorms, and, as one writer put it, ‘all manner of deceptions’. Look at oursociety and even more so those that direct it and you see that all those traitsof the reptilian brain dominate the human experience. We live in a reptilianbrain society run by a network of families, agents and gofers of the Archonsthat exhibit these character traits to the extreme. I’ll come to these familiesin due course. The character traits of the reptilian brain also correspond withthe Nag Hammadi descriptions of the Archons and we are to believe all this isjust a coincidence? No chance. Human society expresses the character traits ofthe Archon-Reptilians because they have transferred their ‘mind’ to humans viagenetics (waveform information) and the Matrix fake reality ‘Hack’ (waveforminformation). The outstanding American cosmologist Carl Sagan, who I’m sure knewfar more than he made public, wrote a book called The Dragons of Eden whichexplored the reptilian genetic influence on human society. He said:[../Images/00464.jpg]Figure 165: The reptilian brain, or R-complex, which dominates much of humanbehaviour.> It does no good whatsoever to ignore the reptilian component of human nature,> particularly our ritualistic and hierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the> model may help us understand what human beings are really about.The focus of the reptilian brain is on survival – not only ‘physical’ survival,but financial survival and that of job, status, reputation, relationship,intellectual preeminence, and all the rest. The reptilian brain is constantly infear of not surviving in all these ways and so many more – just like theArchon-Reptilians fear not surviving without exploiting humanity. The more thathumans can be manipulated into fear in all its expressions, the more we arelocked into the reptilian brain and the Archon-Reptilian hive mind. Look athuman society and the endless information sources that are bombarding us withreasons to fear. Watching television activates the reptilian brain whichcommunicates and absorbs information through the medium of images. Is this yet afurther coincidence when the Control System introduced television and has madeit the most effective form of mass perception programming? I am sure that thisprocess of communicating through imagery connects with the language ofhieroglyphics found in the ancient world. The reptilian brain doesn’t think, itreacts, and this is why it is so fast to respond with the brake pedal, road rageand the hit-the-guy-or-run response to perceived danger known as fight orflight. Observe human behaviour all over the world and you will see that peoplelargely react to events and circumstances rather than think things through or‘heart’ them through. This is by Archon design. Emotional reaction generatesemotional energy while calm assessment does not. There is also a big connectionin terms of the Archontic Control System between the reptilian brain and theleft hemisphere of the brain as I will be detailing later. This further imposesthe Matrix upon human perception.There are many connections between human and reptilian genetics. For instance,there is a substance called ‘pheromone’ secreted and released by animals to bedetected by members of the same species. The pheromones produced by human womenand those produced by iguanas are a chemical match. Reptilian genetics (waveforminformation fields) are employed for all this because reptilian character traits(perception and emotion programs) are genetic expressions of Archon charactertraits. The Archon-Reptilians have a fiercely hierarchical structure of socialorganisation (like the Indian caste system they inspired) and operate as a hivemind, much like bee or ant colonies respond with their antenna to thecommunications (their own form of Matrix) from the Queen. When a queen dies, thecolony looks around and says ‘what the fuck do we do now?’ I saw a cartoon oncewhere sheep were standing around at a cocktail party and in the background asheep dog was coming through the door. ‘Thank goodness’, says one sheep, ‘now wewill know what to do.’ Have I not just described with these simple examples howgreat swathes of humanity behaves and how people look to the Control Systemhierarchy, not least its religions, to tell them what to do and what to think? Acommon theme through the years is how information has been put before me toconfirm something long after I have already said or written about it. It’s like‘look, see, you are on the right track’. I found the books of the Peruvian-bornwriter, Carlos Castaneda, years after I had begun speaking and writing about thehijack of human perception by a non-human force that vampired human emotionalenergy. Castaneda produced a series of works from the late 1960s inspired byconversations with a Central American Yaqui Indian healer or shaman called DonJuan Matus who said that a hidden force that he referred to as the ‘Flyers’covertly controlled human society. He described the Flyers in the same way thatthe Gnostics described the Archons, the pre-Islamic Arabians and Muslims todaydescribe the Jinn and Christians describe demons etc., etc. Don Juan says thefollowing in Castaneda’s final book, The Active Side of Infinity:> We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the> rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord> and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it> suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we> don’t do so ... indeed we are held prisoner!> They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilessly> because we are their sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in coops, the> predators rear us in human coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always> available to them.> Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions> between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems> of belief, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe> that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and> evil; our social mores. They are the ones who set up our dreams of success or> failure. They have given us covetousness, greed and cowardice. It is the> predator who makes us complacent, routinary and egomaniacal.> In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged> themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre – stupendous, of course, from the point> of view of a fighting strategist; a horrendous manoeuvre from the point of> those who suffer it. They gave us their mind. The predators’ mind is baroque,> contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute> now.So much comes from this with regard to what I have been saying and writing allthese years:‘Human beings are its prisoners’ – ‘You are a slave, Neo, born into bondage,born into a prison you cannot see, taste or touch – a prison for your mind’.‘They took us over because we are food to them, and they squeeze us mercilesslybecause we are their sustenance’ – They feed off our low-vibrational emotionalenergy which they induce through the biological software programs they implantedwithin ‘junk’ DNA.‘Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictionsbetween the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems ofbelief, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour’ – Humans are programmedand manipulated to be just intelligent enough to serve as slaves, but notintelligent enough to see that this is what they are.‘Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, ourideas of good and evil; our social mores’ – This is exactly what they have donethrough the perception and emotional programs, the creation of religionscovertly worshipping them as ‘God’, and through the structure of human society.‘They are the ones who set up our dreams of success or failure’ – ditto.‘It is the predator who makes us complacent, routinary and egomaniacal’ – ditto.‘They gave us their mind’ – I have explained in this chapter how they have donethat and I will expand on the theme as we go along.‘The predators’ mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear ofbeing discovered any minute now’ – Humans in their true heart-centred Awarenessare far more powerful than the Archons and when we remember this fact we candelete their energy source (‘food source’) and crash their Control System. Theyknow that and this is why they have to maintain the human Body-Mind in a stateof disconnected amnesia and a fake self-identity of name, job, family,life-story and little me.These revelations have taken us deep in the rabbit hole now, but desperate asthe situation may appear, all is not lost. There is a way out of this and wewill get out of this. From the perspective that I am describing it is no longera mystery why the world is so topsy-turvy, so upside down. The Archon method ofoperation is to distort and invert reality and so, as Michael Ellner said:> Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down. Doctors> destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, psychiatrists destroy minds,> scientists destroy truth, major media destroys information, religions destroy> spirituality and governments destroy freedom.This is Archontic possession at work and it is long past the ‘time’ for humanConsciousness to intervene and sort out these pathetic entities in their schoolcaps and short pants. They’re all-powerful? Yeah, right."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00457.jpg]The Saturn-Moon MatrixIt is proof of a base and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses ormajority, merely because the majority is the majority. Truth does not changebecause it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people.Giordano BrunoSymbols of Saturn, the ‘Lord of the Rings’, are all around us and Saturn iscovertly worshipped by the major religions, secret societies and Satanismalthough even most of the initiates of these connected networks of humansuppression, manipulation and control have no idea that this is so. I willexplain in this chapter why Saturn is so preeminent in the Archon networks atlarge in the human realm.There is a gathering body of evidence to support what I am about to say, butpeople must use their intuition and knowing to decide what feels right ratherthan let their mind alone be the governor of all perception, because we aregoing well beyond purely names-dates-places-type documentable ‘facts’ when weget this deep in the rabbit hole. I have been following what I call the‘language of life’ since my initial awakening in 1990 and this is the languageof synchronicity. The more you can read the signs from long experience the moreyou know when the synchronicity of life is talking and showing you what you needto know. A simple example is when you meet three or four people in quicksuccession in different circumstances who all tell you the same thing or bringup the same subject. This is the language of life – communication from beyondthe five senses – saying ‘look at this’. If you do, it always, but always, leadssomewhere in terms of greater understanding and awareness, or at least it doesin my own experience. I have been doing this all day every day for nearly aquarter of a century and it began after psychic Betty Shine passed on thismessage right at the start of my conscious journey in 1990:> Sometimes he will say things and wonder where they came from. They will be our> words. Knowledge will be put into his mind and at other times he will be led> to knowledge.Shortly afterwards this came through another psychic:> Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out. You only> have to follow the clues ... We are guiding you along a set path. It was all> arranged before you incarnated.This is how the information has come to me ever since along with a vast libraryof documentable facts that I have compiled since this began. My life became anamazing synchronistic journey after I saw Betty Shine and information has beengiven to me in the form of books and documents, and though people and personalexperiences which have taken me deeper and deeper into the nature of humancontrol and suppression. It started with the exposure of what I call thefive-sense conspiracy that can be tracked by the conscious mind and then on tothe Reptilians, the nature of reality and the role in all this of Saturn and theMoon. I have learned from daily experience over more than two decades to readthe signs – ‘Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is already mapped out.You only have to follow the clues’. What I was shown in the 1990s about thefive-sense level of the conspiracy – and laid out in great detail in books like... And The Truth Shall Set You Free – is now being confirmed every day on thetelevision news in terms of world events. What I was shown about the Reptilian(Archon) connection beyond human sight seemed utterly crazy at the time and whenI put the relevant words into a search engine only a few pages came up about areptilian race manipulating human affairs. Do the same today and see theextraordinary difference. What I was shown about the illusory nature of‘physical’ reality and all the other information in this subject area is beingconstantly confirmed drip by drip by even parts of mainstream ‘science’. I wasshown right at the start in 1990 that a vibrational transformation was comingthat would awaken humanity from its amnesia and bring to the surface all thathad been hidden from us. This is demonstrably happening. I am not saying allthis to blow my own trumpet or trombone. I make these points to highlight thatfollowing the clues put before me has unearthed a fantastic body of accurateinformation and insight with a track record of decades. The same process has ledme to the information about the Moon and Saturn. People will just have to decideif it feels right to them. It is not and never has been my intention to peddlebelief-systems, but rather to delete them and let a ‘know-system’, or‘no-system’, take its rightful place as the governor of perception. I am goingto summarise what I have concluded from all the ‘clues’ and you can find furtherinformation in Remember Who You Are and, in terms of the Moon, in Human Race GetOff Your Knees.The Moon is not a creation of ‘nature’, but a construct, or at the very leastpart-‘natural’, part-construct – a gigantic computer and broadcasting operationthat fundamentally influences life on Earth. A body the size of the Moon shouldnot be a satellite of a relatively small planet like Earth. It is 2,160 miles indiameter – bigger than Pluto and a quarter the size of Earth – and the fifthlargest moon in the solar system. There are a stream of anomalies and mysterieswith regard to the Moon which mainstream science cannot explain. So much so thatIrwin Shapiro of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said: ‘Thebest explanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon doesn’t exist.’The Moon is not negative or ‘evil’ in and of itself, just as microphones andtelevision cameras are not responsible for the crap that is daily communicatedthrough them. The Moon is a neutral computer and broadcasting system and what ittransmits is dictated by the force that controls it. That force for aeons hasbeen the Archons who hijacked it and, as such, it has had an incredibly negativeand controlling effect on human perception in ways that I will be describing.This control is in the process of being removed. The Archons do not control ourSun, but they have their own – Saturn. I will be revealing how the majorreligions are covertly worshipping Saturn (an expression of the Demiurge) astheir ‘God’ and how the whole Control System is Saturnian (satanic) and awashwith Saturn symbolism at every level. It is worth emphasising again here thateverything has a form of awareness and that is certainly true of planets andstars. They are expressions of mind or Consciousness depending on their level ofawareness and as such they can be perceived by other limited awareness as a‘god’ (Fig 166). Saturn’s rings have not always been there. They are part of thebroadcasting system of the Matrix and although we only see only those parts ofthe rings within visible light they continue across the solar system to theEarth on the unseen realms and the Moon acts like a transmission booster, amongmany other things, which directs the boosted broadcast at the target – the humanmind and DNA receiver-transmitters (Fig 167). I know, I know, many will now bethinking ‘that Icke really is a nutter’, but anyone who thinks this should atleast take themselves seriously enough to finish the book before reachingconclusions on the basis that all this is so ‘far out’. But ‘far out’ fromwhere? ‘Far out’ from the ‘norms’ of human perceptions and the limitations ofpossibility programmed into those perceptions, that’s where. Humans have no ideahow primitive this world is compared with what is possible. This is the idea,after all, to keep us in ignorance – just intelligent enough to serve as slaves,but not Conscious enough to realise that this is what we are doing.Constructing, or converting, a moon 2,160 miles in diameter is impossible? It ischild’s play beyond the Matrix. Once you cross the line – the scientific Rubicon– where you understand what reality really is and how it works you takeabsolutely gigantic leaps forward in your potential to do endless things thathumans would dismiss as impossible. Human science (in the public arena, anyway)is on one side of that Rubicon and intelligences beyond the Matrix are on theother. If we can only perceive the limits of possibility by the apparentmainstream ‘scientific’ limits of possibility then better just put this bookdown and go have a beer or something. Reading any further would be a waste ofthe time that doesn’t exist. Our concept of what is ‘big’ has to go through themost radical re-evaluation. I know men have been saying that for centuries, butit’s true. When you realise that a pinhead and infinity are the same thing andhow you can encode energy with information that can then manifestholographically, then size is dictated only by the nature of the encoded/decodedinformation.[../Images/00398.jpg]Figure 166: Heavenly bodies, as with everything, are expressions ofConsciousness and have their own Awareness.[../Images/00481.jpg]Figure 167: The Saturn-Moon Matrix broadcasts a fake reality to humanreceiver-transmitter systems which we decode as a world that we think is ‘real’.It is an energetic/information hamster wheel.What I am describing here is the reason Satanists and secret societies of theControl System worship Saturn along with the major religions; and why banking,politics, the court and legal system and so on are all expressions of Saturn, asI will be detailing. Secret society initiates through the centuries who know thescore (only the highest of them) worship Saturn as the Black Sun, Dark Sun andDark Lord. Notice how the Earth’s Sun which they are hacking and want us to fearis being demonised through engineered scares like ‘global warming’ (‘the Sunwill destroy human life’) and skin cancer (when it’s the chemicals insun-blocker that cause the cancer). The Sun will not destroy the Earth – theSun’s temperature goes up and down over billions of years and the temperature onEarth has always remained within a band that the planet and humans can dealwith. Remember, both the Sun and the Earth are Conscious and communicate witheach other – everything is Conscious to a larger or lesser extent. The mediareported in May 2012 how a solar flare triggered a mysterious pulse on the Earththat appeared to ‘answer’ the communication from the Sun. It was only a moderateflare and should not, according the mainstream ‘scientific’ theory, have causedsuch a response. In fact, they say there should have been no response at all;but there was. So much communication is passing between Sun and Earth thatscientists are not aware of because they don’t realise that both bodies areconscious.The Saturn PatternSaturn is not a planet, but a brown dwarf star and it is the same with Jupiterand probably other gas bodies in the solar system (Fig 168). Some dwarf stars‘light up’ while others don’t and they are often referred to as ‘failed stars’.Both Saturn and Jupiter generate more energy than they receive from the Sun. Thefigure is 2.5 times in the case of Saturn. Jupiter accounts for more than 70percent of the mass of ‘planets’ in the solar system and has faint rings.Saturn, like Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, is called a ‘gas giant’, and all havea ring system of some kind although the others’ are nothing like Saturn’s. Youwould say that no life could live on or in Saturn if you are coming purely fromthe human five-sense perception; but we are talking about Archontic entitiesthat were ‘created from smokeless fire’ and are not as we are. In other wordsthey are energetic rather than holographic unless they choose to take form toinfiltrate and confuse. They can quite easily interact with the ‘gas giants’like Saturn. These two dwarf stars, Saturn and Jupiter, have their own mini‘solar systems’ with both having in excess of 60 moons – some of them more likeplanets (Fig 169). The majority of Saturn’s moons are named after the Titans andTitanesses in Greek mythology, the so-called ‘brothers and sisters’ of Saturnwhich was worshipped as a god. Prometheus of Olympic Games’ fame was a Titan andbecame the name of a Saturn moon. The Titans are supposed to have fought theOlympians for control of humanity and this battle by the ‘gods’ for dominionover the Earth is a common theme all over the world. Other Saturn moons arenamed after Inuit, Gallic and Norse gods and goddesses. Saturn’s biggest moon isTitan, the second-largest in the Solar System behind the Jupiter moon, Ganymede.Titan is twice as big as our own moon which itself is enormous for a satelliteof a small planet like Earth. Scientists have suggested that some form of lifecould exist on Titan and another Saturn moon, Iapetus. Astronomy is still so inits infancy that brown dwarfs were only discovered in 1995 and it has now beensuggested within the scientific community that there may be as many brown dwarfsas there are full-fledged stars. It is hardly a surprise then that we have somein our solar system. We need to keep our minds open to our own insight ratherthan have our perception programmed by what ‘scientists’ tell us to think. Theywill say something different tomorrow and it’s worth noting that until less thana hundred years ago mainstream science believed that there was only one galaxy –ours. The Hubble telescope put paid to that nonsense but there is plenty morewhere that came from – ‘Wisdom is knowing how little we know’, as Socrates said.From ‘there’s only one galaxy’ in the 1920s the same mainstream science now saysthere are possibly hundreds of billions of galaxies, even 500 billion accordingto a German computer study. We have gone from one galaxy to hundreds of billionsin 90-odd years simply through the development of more advanced technology andyet there would have been a time when anyone suggesting that there was more thanone would have been dismissed and laughed at. Science knows best, see. Well,experience shows over and over and over again that it doesn’t. Once you letscientists dictate your sense of reality, your sense of the possible, you areliving in their box – and they could not fill a data stick compared with whatthere is to know. Mainstream science gives you the official line from anofficial hierarchical structure of power that wants to maintain humanity in astate of subservient ignorance. No way are mainstream song sheet scientistsgoing to pursue my contention that we live in a hacked reality that isconstantly feeding us a fake version of everything. Gnostic texts say that theDemiurge-Archons control the whole solar system except for the Sun, Earth andMoon. This may well once have been true, but I say they have hijacked the Moon,too, for reasons that I will explain. In the end, the entire solar system andall that we see in the night sky is in my view akin to a computer-generatedillusion and only a fake copy of the universe as it really is.[../Images/00288.jpg]Figure 168: Saturn is not a planet but a form of sun.[../Images/00515.jpg]Figure 169: The Saturn ‘solar system’.Can’t be done? Click, click – enterIt is important to keep in mind that what we see as Saturn is only a holographicexpression of waveform information fields and, as with everything else, it hasconsciousness. So when Satanists and others worship Saturn as a god they are notworshipping a ‘dead planet’ (sun), but the conscious entity that is Saturn – anexpression of what the Gnostics called the Demiurge. Ancient accounts describe avery different solar system to the one we see today with Saturn as once thepredominant Earth sun. Researcher David Talbott made a long and intensive studyof the global Saturn myths before he became involved in the Electric Universemovement and there is no question from the information that he documents thatSaturn dominated the ancient sky and was the dominant feature in ancientsymbolism and worship. See his book, The Saturn Myth. I don’t necessarily agreewith every last conclusion, but it is a very impressive and brilliant work.Descriptions of Saturn make no mention of rings before the great cataclysmicevents that rearranged the solar system and dispatched Saturn to a location some800 million miles or more from Earth. This seems to be a long distance, but interms of energetic connection and communication it is the same principle as twoparticles communicating instantly over billions of miles. Time and space areholographic illusions and the communication takes place beyond the holographic‘world’ in the realm of the unified field. The rings of Saturn are relativelyvery recent, so where did they come from? Saturn was ‘converted’ to become abroadcaster of the Matrix Hack and the rings are a manifestation of this. Yes, Iknow, it sounds crazy, but stay with me because it’s not. The frequency ‘veil’between our reality and the Archontic realm is pretty thin anyway, but there arecertain locations in the Earth’s magnetic field where it is very thin indeed.Many of these locations of reality interconnection are the result of beingtargeted by the repetitive rituals of Satanists. Their impact on the energyfield thins out the frequency differences to create a sort of vibrationalgateway through which Archontic entities can slip into this reality during therituals. Former Satanists and those forced to participate by Satanists havedescribed this to me. Saturn takes this process a whole lot further. It is aninter-frequency gateway that allows Archontic entities to move between theirreality and ours and it is a means – and there will be others – through which‘Hack’ information can be projected from the Archontic realm into ours. Thisinformation is broadcast through Saturn (hence the rings) on the frequency bandthat can be received by human DNA which was specifically tuned to this frequencyband during the genetic manipulation that I described earlier (Fig 170). Saturnis, in short, a gigantic inter-reality gateway and broadcasting unit and therings are a sound (waveform information) system. It was converted to be so bythe Archontic realm and became a focus of worship for Archontic religions,secret societies and Satanism (Saturnism). Saturn was known by the ancients asthe ‘Fallen One’ and it is symbolised by the black-clad Darth Vader in the StarWars movies of insider George Lucas. Darth Vader was a ‘Jedi’ Knight calledAnakin Skywalker who fell to the ‘dark side of the Force’. Interestingly, theAnakim, with only an ‘m’ replacing the ‘n’, were said to be a race of biblicalgiants living in Palestine and ancestors of the Philistines and the giantGoliath. The Sun that we know, like all suns, is broadcasting the universalwaveform energy field that becomes the decoded holographic universe. Even thenour Sun is also a bad copy ‘sun’ and not the original. Nothing in our hackedreality is original except the expanded awareness of those who can see throughthe program. Saturn is the Demiurge sun and a means of broadcasting the bad copyto distort, twist and invert human perception. Therefore, ‘Dark Sun’, ‘BlackSun’ and ‘Dark Lord’, the names given to Saturn by the ancients and today’ssecret societies and Satanists, are very appropriate. Saturn has often beensymbolised through the centuries as an eye, hence the all-seeing eye used as amajor symbol of the Saturnic/satanic Control System network (Figs 171 and 172).One of the many clues that I was given about Saturn came when I visited thesubway station that once served the World Trade Center in New York and saw amassive depiction on the floor of an eye broadcasting frequency fields acrossthe world (Fig 173). The station also has eyes in the walls along all theplatforms and it’s a strange place. The image of the eye broadcasting across theEarth provides a perfect visual symbol of what is actually happening and thereason for Saturn’s artificial ring system (Fig 174). Remember how the Gnostictexts say that the outermost planetary sphere or Archon in the Control System isSaturn and beyond that was Leviathan, a snake swallowing its own tail in theform that has become known as the Ouroboros, or what some call theRing-Pass-Not. The conversion of Saturn into a ringed hacking machine did nothave to be done ‘physically’ within the holographic realm. It could have beendone by encoding new information at the waveform level of the bad copy which isthen decoded through into the re-designed holographic Saturn that we know today.People must stop being programmed by their perception of ‘physical’ reality withall its inherent limitations. There is no physical and there are no limitationsif you know what you are doing. You want to create a moon or a converted Saturn?Okay, click, click, enter. This is the reality that we are really dealing with.It could have been done energetically in other ways, but it would not have beendone ‘physically’ because there is no physical.[../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 170: Saturn is an inter-reality gateway that connects with the Archonrealm and broadcasts the Matrix.> [../Images/00008.jpg]> Figure 171: Saturn has been symbolised as an eye.> [../Images/00236.jpg]> Figure 172: We see this today on the dollar bill and the Great Seal.[../Images/00570.jpg]Figure 173: The Saturn eye broadcasting across the world, as portrayed at theGround Zero subway station in New York.[../Images/00189.jpg]Figure 174: Saturn’s broadcasting system.There is another vital point to make here that will explain so much about whatis happening today. Yes, the Archons made a bad copy of the universe as itreally is but they started out with a bad copy of something wonderful whichincluded so many elements that did not suit their goal of human suppression andperception enslavement. They have since worked to delete all the things thatstimulate expanded awareness, love, peace and harmony and to distort and inverteverything. This is why the world has ‘progressed’ technologically (in theory)but regressed in almost every other way. The cataclysmic events that rearrangedthe planets and Saturn did not happen in the original universe only in the copyand this was a major example of the further distorting of the copy for thebenefit of Archontic control.Give us a ringDr Norman Bergrun, a much-awarded American scientist and engineer, has beenexposing strange phenomena around Saturn for decades (Fig 175). He is a formerscientist with what became NASA’s Ames Research Center and was also employed byLockheed Missiles and Space Company and Douglas Aircraft. He later establishedhis own research and engineering operation. Bergrun became fascinated by Saturnwhen he studied photographs from the missions to Saturn by Voyagers I and IIwhich arrived in 1980 and 1981 after first travelling to Jupiter. Bergrunconcluded from a detailed study of the Voyager pictures that the rings of Saturnare not natural. Absolutely they’re not. The rings are said to consist almostentirely of water ice, but I suggest that it will eventually be found that the‘water ice’ is a form of crystal, possibly unknown on Earth, which is part ofthe transmitter-receiver system. Also connected to this is the fact that Saturnspins so fast that even though the surface area is 83.7 times bigger than Earththe Saturn day lasts less than eleven hours. Saturn spins at an estimated 35,700kilometres an hour or 22,000 miles an hour. Norman Bergrun concluded that therings are generated by gigantic cylindrical objects, electromagnetic in nature,which can be identified in many pictures (Figs 176, 177 and 178). When I say‘gigantic’ I mean up to three times the size of the Earth. The Archon ‘big’ isnot the same as the human ‘big’ and this puts into greater perspective mycontention that the Earth’s Moon, big as it may seem, is a construct. Acomparison between the size of the Earth against that of Saturn clearly revealsthat we are not dealing with same sense of ‘big’ which, like illusory ‘time’, isyet another relative perception . (Fig 179). It is worth emphasising thatBergrun does not refer to these phenomena as conventional spaceships, but as‘electromagnetic vehicles’. Yes, precisely. They are not ‘solid’, but energetic– the same as the Archontic force which I suggest is behind them. Where do theycome from? I say from the Archontic realm and very probably through theinterreality gateway that is Saturn. Their job is to release the energy thatbuilds the artificial rings and there are images that show this actuallyhappening (Figs 180). Where I differ from Bergrun is that he says that the ringsare created by trails of effluent or exhaust discharged by these objects. Ifthat were the case, Al Gore would have made a call by now from his private jetor stretch limo to complain about the dangers of ‘Saturn warming’. I say thatthe rings are a gigantic broadcasting system and what is being released by theelectromagnetic vehicles is essential to that. Bergrun noticed that some ofthese electromagnetic craft can be seen at points where rings were not yetcompleted. He says that ‘such an immense propulsive body implies a space enginepossessing unheard-of capacity and capability’. Either that or, as I suggest, itis all being done electromagnetically. Bergrun said:[../Images/00401.jpg]Figure 175: Dr Norman Bergrun.> [../Images/00531.jpg]> Figure 176, 177 and 178: NASA images of Bergrun’s super massive> ‘electromagnetic vehicles’.[../Images/00225.jpg]Figure 179: A size comparison between Saturn and Earth.

Hesays that some of the Moon’s craters and the scoring out of the landscape couldhave been caused by these electromagnetic strikes and he notes that ‘mobilebodies of high electrical potential can entrap and disfigure celestial bodies[and this] has implications of unforeseeable magnitude’. It also hasimplications for what caused the cataclysmic events in the solar system thatallowed for the hijack of humanity to reach such an advanced stage. Bergrunwrites of these extraordinary electromagnetic phenomena:> A concentrated presence of them appears at Saturn, thereby introducing the> interesting speculation that the planet serves as an operational base.> Ultra-superlative intellect is implied by the existence of these highly> sophisticated electromagnetic vehicles. Not only do these units demonstrate> mastery of nuclear power and massive electro-potential force fields, but also> they show an ability to modify extensive surface areas of large celestial> bodies. Indeed, a realistic possibility is raised that good-sized celestial> bodies can be moved about.This brings us back again to how the cataclysmic events in the heavens couldhave happened. My own view is that there is such a concentration of thesevehicles around Saturn because (a) the work on the rings is ongoing and (b) theyenter our reality through the gateway of Saturn. Bergrun said of his findings:‘These are not conclusions you ordinarily would expect from someone with such atraditional background, but upon applying scientific rigour to the study ofSaturn, its rings and its moons, the facts keep pushing me toward someinescapable conclusions.’ His interest began when he saw the images beamed fromVoyager I in 1980 and from Voyager II in 1981 and noticed some highlysignificant differences between the two. ‘That was the starting point for me.I’ve been researching this ever since’, he said. Bergrun detailed his findingsin a book, Ringmakers of Saturn, and his conclusions have gained further supportwith images recorded by NASA’s Cassini mission which arrived in 2004. Cassinicaptured the same cylindrical objects of fantastic scale in and around Saturn’srings but NASA simply ignores this (Fig 181). Bergrun makes the point thatSaturn’s rings do not remain the same and often change to the point wherephenomena highlighted by one astronomer will no longer be there when anotherobserves the same area at a later point. This even applies to the gaps betweensome of the rings which include the Cassini division and the Enke gap:> A conclusion is reached that the A-ring outer annulus can be constructed with> vehicles having different lengths and emission patterns. Therefore, the Enke> gap can be located almost anywhere, or not at all, within the A-ring depending> upon length and positioning of the vehicles forming the inner and outer> annuli. In view of this possibility, the difficulty of early observers in> pin-pointing a single radial location for the Enke division is now readily> understandable. Inability to obtain unanimous opinion for ring thickness is> also explained ...> ... In summary, the A and B rings are formed by slender mobile vehicles> trailing massive efflux.

The C-ring and the F-ring formations apparently depend upon> the presence of a nearby vehicle. At birth, the A and B rings appear to have> electromagnetic properties. In view of the generating mechanism, heretofore> confusing variations in observational results now become explicable.Yes, they do have electromagnetic properties because they are radio wavesbroadcasting information. I was sent an image of a Saturn ring by a professionalsound engineer because he said that the ring looked exactly like the sound waveshe saw every day on his sound technology (Fig 182). Norman Bergrun says that theofficial view that the rings could be explained by remnants of small moons wasnot tenable. ‘Several years ago, a number of folks in the astronomy and physicsworld began theorising that these rings had to be much younger than theuniverse, perhaps only about 100 million years old’, he said. ‘But one pair ofpictures shows a change in five minutes!’ Bergrun says that observations aremade and then taken as ‘how things are’ when they were only temporarily ‘howthings were’ at the time of the observation. He writes:> An impression is conveyed that latest reported measurements purport to be the> true ones when, in reality, all might be quite nearly correct at time of> observation. General reluctance to accept variable ring-system geometry occurs> because of apparent failure to identify a physical mechanism suitable for> producing recurrent change.This is the typical response of mainstream ‘science’: it can’t be true becausewe can’t work out how it could be true. Bergrun describes how numerous jets areemitted from different points on the giant electromagnetic ‘vehicles’. ‘Each jetappears to consist of a series of bulbous swellings’, he writes. ‘Such swellingsare indicative of the form of electrically-charged flows known as pinchedplasmas. He says that the existence of the rings is dependent upon theelectromagnetic vehicles and this is why rings come and go – ‘Specifically, therings are related to vehicle positioning and degree of emission activity’. WhatBergrun says about the rings being made by these ‘craft’, whatever they are,absolutely fits with my contention that the Saturn dwarf sun (the bad copyversion) has been converted into a colossal broadcasting system and is at leasta key part of the Matrix Hack. I have also heard claims that the craft Bergruntalks about have been seen very close to the Sun and elsewhere in the solarsystem before returning to Saturn.[../Images/00493.jpg]Figure 182: Saturn’s rings are sound waves.In plain sightNow we can begin to understand why the ancient world and today’s secret society,Satanic and religious organisations and networks have always been so obsessedwith Saturn. It is at the very core of everything they do, but to see this youhave to get up to speed with the many and various ways that Saturn is symbolisedand worshipped. Many are superbly revealed by David Talbott in The Saturn Mythand a major one is the ‘U’ shape or ‘crescent’. This comes from a characteristicof Saturn which is described in ancient accounts throughout the world of whatSaturn looked like when viewed from the Earth before the cataclysmic events thatcaused the dramatic change of location. Talbott explains: ‘The subject of theglobal creation legend is a spectacular cosmic event actually witnessed by theancients; massive quantities of cosmic debris exploded from Saturn, clouding theheavens and eventually congealing into a vast band around the planet.’ Lightfrom the Sun illuminated this Saturn band of debris at different parts of theday when observed from the spinning and orbiting Earth and this led to thesymbolism of the illuminated part of the band as a girdle, horns, collar, crownand many other symbols, including the wheel. The ancient accounts describe howVenus and Mars orbited in a straight line with Saturn and the Earth and appearedas like a circle or two circles in the centre of Saturn (Fig 183). You findancient symbols galore portraying the various daily phases of the ‘luminouscrescent’, but most refer to the phase when the crescent appeared at the bottomof Saturn because that was where it was during most of the waking day (Figs 184,185 and 186). Just to give you a feel for what it must have looked like – youcan see in Figure 187 the luminous crescent around the Saturn moon Iapetuscaused by the back light reflecting from the Saturn sun. It is not the samephenomenon, but the view must have been similar. You can also see from thepositions of Mars and Venus when Saturn was seen from the Earth why Saturn cameto be symbolised as the All-Seeing Eye – one of the major symbols to this day ofthe Archontic secret society and Satanic networks controlled by Archonspossessing human form. I’ll be going into detail about the Archon bloodlinenetworks operating within our reality. Saturn is the ‘Lord of the Rings’ in theTolkien epic. J R R Tolkien was a Professor of Anglo–Saxon at Oxford Universityand a close friend was C S Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis wassymbolising the existence of other dimensions of reality while Tolkien wassymbolising Saturnian control of humanity. When the source of that control isrevealed in Lord of the Rings, it turns out to be a massive fiery reptilian eye.Not only that, but the eye is portrayed in the movie within a Ushape which is anancient and universally-used symbol for Saturn (Fig 188). This Saturn crescentor ‘U’ symbol is the inspiration for the ancient themes about the ‘horned god’that led to the horned helmets of the Vikings and the horned headdress and discsused by the Egyptians (Fig 189). The symbol of Islam had been thought torepresent the Sun and the crescent moon, but it is clear now that this is aclassic representation of Saturn as a crescent and a star (Fig 190). You see thesame theme in today’s Archon-controlled entertainment industry. Madonna gave ablatant display of Saturn symbolism at half-time in the 2012 Super Bowl coveragewatched by more than a hundred million people. There was the ‘illuminated’all-seeing eye, horned headdress, and so much else (Figs 191 and 192).> [../Images/00383.jpg]> Figure 183: Saturn’s ‘luminous crescent’ following it’s daily sequence as> viewed from Earth before the catastrophe when Saturn was so close that it> dominated the heavens for Earth people.> [../Images/00533.jpg]> Figure 184, 185 and 186: Some of the many and various ancient symbols of> Saturn and its luminous crescent[../Images/00453.jpg]Figure 187: A backlit Iapetus, a moon of Saturn, giving a feel for how theluminous crescent would have appeared from Earth.[../Images/00448.jpg]Figure 188: The Saturn symbol and the fiery reptilian eye from Lord of theRings.> [../Images/00239.jpg]> Figure 189: The luminous crescent horn symbol of Saturn.[../Images/00197.jpg]Figure 190: The symbol of Islam.> [../Images/00188.jpg]> Figure 191: Madonna and the swirling fiery eye during her Saturnesque> performance at the Super Bowl.> [../Images/00432.jpg]> Figure 192: Madonna and the horns of Saturn.> [../Images/00077.jpg]> Figure 193: The permanent swirling eye storm at Saturday’s south pole.> [../Images/00532.jpg]> Figure 194: The permanent hexagon storm the size of two Earths at Saturn’s> north pole.Once again the depiction was of a swirling, fiery eye. A massive and apparentlypermanent swirling ‘eye’ storm two-thirds the diameter of the Earth has beenrecorded at Saturn’s southern pole (Fig 193). Eye-storms had not previously beenfound anywhere other than the Earth. There is also a permanent hexagon storm thesize of two Earths at Saturn’s northern pole which has confounded scientists(Fig 194). The hexagon completes a rotation every 10 hours 39 minutes and 24seconds – exactly the same period of Saturn’s very powerful radio emissions. Thehexagon is a ‘flat’ version of a six-sided cube as is made very clear in theimage of a crop circle that appeared in England in 2012 (Fig 195). The cube justhappens to be an ancient symbol of Saturn. Islam, as with Christianity, Judaismand many other Archon-inspired religions, covertly worships Saturn and so itsfocus of worship at Mecca is a black cube, or the Kaaba which literally meanscube (Fig 196). The symbol of the cross, which was used as a focus of worshipway before Christianity claimed it for its own, is another geometricalexpression of the hexagon/cube. The cross is, like the hexagon, a flattened outcube (Fig 197). The hexagon/cube is also expressed as the six-pointed hexagram,or Star of David. The six-pointed star is an ancient symbol of Saturn and theorigin of the name Rothschild ‘Red-Shield’ (or ‘Red-Sign’ in German) after thered hexagram on their house in Frankfurt, Germany (Fig 198). The Satanist(Saturnist) Rothschilds were called Bauer before they changed their name to onerepresenting this major symbol of Saturn. The symbol is now on the flag ofRothschild-created Israel, a prime vehicle for the Archon manipulation of humansociety (Fig 199). The eye, cube and hexagram are all symbols of Saturn and allused profusely by the Archon networks within human society and their secretsocieties, religions and Satanists? This is all coincidence??[../Images/00112.jpg]Figure 195: This crop formation in England provides an excellent portrayal of acube as a hexagon or flattened-out cube.[../Images/00341.jpg]Figure 196: The black cube, or the Kaaba, at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the focus ofworship for Muslims.[../Images/00450.jpg]Figure 197: A geometrical cross is also a flattened-out cube.[../Images/00080.jpg]Figure 198: The Saturn symbol from which the name ‘Rothschild’ derives.Knowledge of symbols and what they are and what they do is crucial tounderstanding how human society is being manipulated by the Archontic force. Ihave listed only a few headlines here in relation to Saturn, but I will be goingmuch deeper into symbolism and its effect. Enough to say now that Saturn isgenerating very powerful sound waves via radio waves and if you put ‘sounds ofSaturn’ into YouTube you will be able to hear the eerie, guttural,satanic-sounding broadcasts that Saturn emits, as recorded by the Cassinimission. What you will actually be listening to is the sound of the Matrix. Thehexagon and eye storms at Saturn’s poles are permanent because of the repeatingsound emissions which are causing them to form in sync with the sound waves.They will remain until the sound changes. I have been highlighting since the1990s the significance of a sound phenomenon known as cymatics in which sound isplayed across particles on a metal plate and the particles form into amazinggeometrical shapes to reflect the vibration and resonance of the sound. When youchange the sound the formations change to reflect the new vibrational ‘matrix’and again if you put cymatics into YouTube you will see many examples of this atwork (Fig 200). When the sound is turned off the particles just lie there inrandom piles. The hexagon at Saturn’s North Pole, as with its geometricalexpressions, the hexagram and cube, are all manifestations of a certain soundfrequency which Saturn emits. Sounds and symbols are different manifestations ofthe same frequency. The sound is the symbol and the symbol is the sound. So byplacing Saturn symbolism all around us the Archons are constantly broadcastingthe sound – information – from Saturn into the planetary and human energyfields. They are doing this directly from Saturn, but the symbols underpin itseffect on human perception. I found a cymatics video on YouTube in which thesounds were constantly and very quickly changing and therefore so were thesymbols being created; but by freezing the frames I was able to isolate, as‘coincidence’ would have it, symbols of the hexagon and hexagram or sixpointedstar (Fig 201). These were created by sound waves because those symbols areholographic reflections of those sound waves – thus the symbols of Saturn emitSaturn vibrations and sound (information) beyond the frequency of the human fivesenses. They are holographic expressions of the Matrix (Fig 202). Standing wavesare well named because they are waves that ‘stand’ or stay the same so long asthe sound or flow that is keeping them constant remains the same. This is whatwe see with the phenomena of Saturn and its rings and eye and hexagon storms.They are standing waves, of which more later (Figs 203 and 204).[../Images/00474.jpg]Figure 199: The symbol of Saturn became the symbol of the Rothschild fiefdom ofIsrael.[../Images/00039.jpg]Figure 200: Cymatics – sound creating form.[../Images/00084.jpg]Figure 201: Sound was vibrating this material far too quickly to see the symbolsthat it was creating, but when I froze the frames this is what I got.[../Images/00483.jpg]Figure 202: Sound wave = symbol; and symbol = sound wave. They are differentexpressions of the same frequency.[../Images/00568.jpg]Figure 203: This is a standing wave ring phenomena which will remain like thisso long as the sound wave that is creating it continues.[../Images/00430.jpg]Figure 204: The eye-like image on the left is created by a standing wave and sois the eye storm at Saturn’s south pole.The language of symbolsThe central role of symbols in the Archon perception deception cannot beoverstated and this is a good point to explain why before we go on. I have beenhighlighting for two decades the significance of symbols in religion, secretsocieties, Satanism and society in general. Symbols are put before us almostwherever we look and there are many that constantly appear across an enormousrange of organisations and institutions that appear to have no connection. Butthey do – the Archons who communicate through what I call the language ofsymbols and the majority relate to Saturn (Fig 205). What’s more, the samesymbols can be seen throughout the ancient world almost no matter what thecultural or historical setting. They were used by the Nazis in Germany and todaythey are used to apparently represent countries (as on flags), the UnitedNations, family crests, corporate logos and most certainly by the religions,secret societies and Satanists who represent different faces of the sameArchontic Control System (Fig 206). They use the same symbols – dominated bythose of Saturn – because they are all working for the Archontic agenda forhumanity, although the great majority of those involved will have no idea thatthis is so. What is happening is so simple once you breach the smokescreen ofapparent division and complexity to see the global web with countless ‘strands’all representing the Archontic realm within our reality. So we are looking atArchon-controlled royalty, governments, banks, corporations, media, military,medicine, pharmaceuticals, biotech, chemical food production, religions, secretsocieties and Satanism. Now you can see why they all employ the same symbolsincluding the flame or lighted torch, pyramid and all-seeing eye, the eye ingeneral, six-pointed star, pentagram, hexagram, cube and many more that I willhighlight. So why do they do it? Is it just for a laugh? Oh, no. Their symbolsconfirm ownership of an organisation to other initiates of the Archontic controlnetworks, but their use goes far deeper into the realms of ‘physics’ and thelanguage of the subconscious. If you can gain access to someone’s subconsciousyou can take complete control of their thinking, perceptions and behaviour whilethey believe they are making all the decisions and forming all their ownperceptions of reality. The term ‘subliminal’ means ‘below threshold’ – belowthe threshold of the conscious mind and the perception deception is based onbypassing the conscious mind and its potential to see and question beforereaching conclusions. The aim is to plant thoughts, beliefs and perceptions intothe subconscious mind from where they filter through to the conscious mind asapparently the person’s own thoughts, beliefs and perceptions. This is the waysubliminal advertising works, but the power and effectiveness of symbols inperception programming is not understood. It is, however, so simple once youunderstand the nature of reality.[../Images/00408.jpg]Figure 205: Symbols (information fields) are a prime means of Archoncommunication with the human subconscious mind.[../Images/00314.jpg]Figure 206: The same symbols can be seen in many guises because the variousexpressions of the Archon Control System are worshipping the same force.I have already emphasised that everything in our reality is a waveforminformation field from which our ‘physical’ (holographic) world is made manifestin the same way in theme as a hologram is projected from a waveform interferencepattern. This waveform information is communicated through the five-senses tothe brain (another information field) which constructs holographic reality aswell as the person’s beliefs and perceptions. There are five senses and so fiveaccess points for information – sound, sight, smell, touch and taste. These allcommunicate electrical information to the brain from waveform fields. When wecommunicate verbally we generate vibrating information fields from the vocalchords and these are decoded by the hearing senses of the receiver. Their brainthen translates the information fields into language that we ‘hear’ (but onlyafter the brain has done its work). Voice to ear communication is heard by theconscious mind so long as it is loud enough to be above-threshold and this givesthe conscious mind the choice of what to think of it; but informationcommunicated through the ‘eyes’ or sight-sense is quite another thing and morethan 80 percent of the information from which the brain constructs reality comesthrough this source. Only a tiny fraction of the apparently visual informationthat we perceive is registered by the conscious mind and the rest is absorbed intotal by the subconscious. You want to access the subconscious? The ‘eyes’ haveit. If someone is talking to you and you miss a word you usually know that andask them to repeat what they said. But how can you possibly know what yourconscious mind has not seen in every visual panorama, but your subconscious has?You can’t. We are now at the core of why symbols are so vital to mass perceptionprogramming. Symbols are information fields every bit as much as the spoken wordand the only difference is that they enter the brain via a different route (Fig207). Symbols generate their encoded information that is based on what theyrepresent or symbolise. Saturn is a classic case in point with the hexagram,hexagon, cube and eye representing the radio wave frequencies broadcast fromSaturn. Crucially in terms of the Archontic agenda, the information encodedwithin and generated by symbols bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight tothe subconscious (Fig 208). Every time people are in the presence of symbols(almost all day, every day, not least through television) they are unknowinglyhaving their perceptions programmed and these will filter through to theirconscious mind with ‘I have just had a thought’; ‘you know what I think?’ and ‘Ireally fancy a Coke’. This is why the great Chinese philosopher Confucius(551-479 BC) said: ‘Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.’ Butthere’s more. I have described how the Archons drain human emotional energy andhuman life force and this is another aspect of the symbolism scenario. A symbolvibrates to the frequency of what it represents – as with Saturn – and allsymbols that represent the Archontic force vibrate to the frequency of thatforce. When you focus your attention on these symbols (as with religiousfollowers) you are making a frequency connection with the symbol and so what thesymbol represents – the Archons in all their forms. Once this energeticconnection is made there is a compatible frequency channel through which yourenergy can be vampired by those in the unseen in line with the process known as‘energy flows where attention goes’ (Fig 209). This is done en masse at greatreligious gatherings like those at the Vatican and by royal occasions in the UKwhen tens of millions focus their attention on those personifications ofArchontic symbolism, the royal family. This focus/symbol energetic connectionmeans that Muslims across the world are making an energetic connection withSaturn five times a day when they go down on their knees to focus on Mecca andthe black-cubed Kaaba and even more when they go in person during the Hajj (Figs210 and 211). It is the same with Jews, Christians, Hindus – all of them. Thisis why society is awash with symbols. I shall be returning to this subject andits effect and influence because it is so central to human manipulation.[../Images/00542.jpg]Figure 207: Symbols enter the brain through the sight senses and sound throughthe hearing senses but the effect is the same – information communicated to thebrain to be constructed into a sense of reality.[../Images/00204.jpg]Figure 208: Symbols mostly deliver information subliminally to the subconsciousmind with the conscious mind oblivious of what is happening.[../Images/00428.jpg]Figure 209: Energy flows where attention goes.[../Images/00539.jpg]Figure 210: What you focus upon you connect with energetically.[../Images/00005.jpg]Figure 211: The thousands walking around the Kaaba at any one time become anelectromagnetic motor which generates ‘food’ for the ‘gods’.Saturn callingSaturn is a colossal broadcasting operation with its visible ring systemcurrently divided into seven designations and sub-divisions, but the rings thatwe see are only part of the information delivery system. NASA announced in 2009that the Spitzer Space Telescope had identified another ring circling Saturnfrom a distance of some 3.7 million miles and extending to 7.4 million (Fig212). It is so enormous that it could encompass a billion Earths. But Saturn isalso broadcasting ‘rings’ that resonate in the unseen realms right across thesolar system (as portrayed with regard to the Earth in the New York subwaystation) and their target is the receiver-transmitter processes of human DNA andthe wider genetic structure. The goal is for the Saturn Matrix and the programsrunning through ‘junk’ DNA to constantly construct our sense of reality in thosefew cubic centimetres at the back of the brain. Only by awakening from Body-Mindinto the greater Consciousness can we override this monumental perceptiondeception. The broadcasts come directly to the Earth, but they are also pickedby the giant computer and receiver-transmitter system inside the Moon and beamedat the Earth in an amplified form (Fig 213). The genetic manipulation tunedhuman DNA to this frequency band and we have been decoding a fake reality eversince believing it to be real. The Saturn-Moon broadcasts also constantlytrigger the perceptional, emotional and false memory programs within non-codingDNA. The predators have to focus our attention in Body-Mind – the reality bandin which the broadcasts operate – or we would expand our perception into a levelof awareness that would (a) dilute the influence of the Matrix, and (b) allowhumans to see the world for what it is – a fake reality designed to enslave usin a prison of engineered perception. When we decode reality only throughBody-Mind we are fully in the Saturn-Moon Matrix and living our lives in thehamster- wheel while believing we are getting somewhere. I said earlier that Ifeel that most people go through an entire lifetime in this reality withouthaving a single original thought or emotional response once the Matrix has themin its perception heist. They become like computer terminals on a wirelessInternet. The system operates in basically the same way as worker ants and beesfollowing the program broadcast by their queen. Add the words Saturn and Moon tothis scene from The Matrix and you have it in one:[../Images/00440.jpg]Figure 211: The massive Saturn ring revealed in 2009.[../Images/00111.jpg]Figure 213: The Moon amplifies the Saturn Matrix.> The [Saturn–Moon] Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this> very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or you turn on your> television.

It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to> blind you from the truth.> ‘What truth?’> That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage ...> born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your> mind.The Matrix has entrapped unconscious humanity in the Archon hive mind which ishierarchical to the extreme and this is how the Archons, in the words of shamanDon Juan Matus in the Carlos Castaneda books: ‘... gave us their mind’. TheMatrix also blocks information as well as delivering its own. The Earth energyfield and atmosphere already filter out forms of radiation that would be harmfuland all I am saying is that far more energy (information) communicated via theSun is blocked before we can decode it into visual and perceptual reality. Imentioned earlier how entire galaxies in the frequency band of analoguetelevision broadcasts could not be seen until the United States switched over todigital television. Whole galaxies can be blocked out by television broadcastsand the Archons couldn’t do that with infinitely more advanced technology?Scientists are using so-called ‘metamaterials’ to create invisibility, as I alsooutlined earlier with the story of the safecrackers who could go about theirbusiness without being seen by a security camera. Human science can do thisalready and what I am suggesting is very straightforward once you have anunderstanding of what reality is and how it can be manipulated. The vibrationalouter ‘wall’, or firewall, of the Hack is the alleged speed of light – speed ofthe Matrix.Blinded by the LightI say that the most profound and perception-deceiving inversion of all is thebelief that light = good and dark = bad. I don’t like the terms good and bad,but you’ll get my drift when I say that far from believing in the universallyaccepted good-bad concept of the light and dark. I say the reverse is closer tothe truth. If I question ‘the light’, then according to the current definition Imust have rejected ‘good’ in favour of ‘bad’. But what is ‘light’? What are wedescribing when we speak of light? Is it the sort that brightens up a room whenwe flick on the switch; or the light when the Sun appears over the horizon – thelight in which we can see, rather than the dark in which we can’t? But that‘light’ is only a frequency band of energy or information fields. It is onlyvisible light, a tiny frequency band within the electromagnetic spectrum. It isan energetic information source that we decode into the light that we think wesee. In fact, we only see anything when light reflects off it. This is why wecan’t see in a state of absolutely pitch black, no light whatsoever. I cameacross this explanation at the website, physicsclassroom.com[http://www.physicsclassroom.com]:> The bottom line is: without light, there would be no sight. The visual ability> of humans and other animals is the result of the complex interaction of light,> eyes and brain. We are able to see because light from an object can move> through space and reach our eyes.> Once light reaches our eyes, signals are sent to our brain, and our brain> deciphers the information in order to detect the appearance, location and> movement of the objects we are sighting. The whole process, as complex as it> is, would not be possible if it were not for the presence of light. Without> light, there would be no sight.I would put it rather differently. We could not ‘see’ if it were not for thepresence of light because the Body-Mind computer has been tuned to the frequencyband that we call light, or visible light. What if that tiny frequency band andthe electromagnetic spectrum were the Matrix, the Hack? And what if the realuniverse exists beyond that in realms that we can neither see, nor detect withtechnology? What if the unhacked universe exists in the realms that mainstreamscience refers to as ‘dark’ matter/mass/energy? They call it ‘dark’ because theycan’t see it and they can’t see it because it doesn’t reflect light within thefrequency band of Body-Mind or human technology. But calling it dark doesn’tmake it dark in the sense that we perceive the word. It is the light-darkconfusion again which is why I prefer the terms visible universe (hardly any ofit) and invisible universe (the rest of it). Is there even a universe at all aswe think we know it? These questions need to be considered when the illusion andthe trickery go so deep. When people have near-death experiences and withdrawfrom Body-Mind and visible light they can still see without their eyes andwithout visible light. Nor is what they experience usually dark in the luminoussense. So where does that ‘light’ come from? It is merely that they are decodinganother frequency band into another reality that they can ‘see’. Do we reallybelieve that all Infinity is pitch black except for visible light, a frequencyrange that is so narrow it’s laughable? There are many forms of ‘light’ and theone we perceive is only one of them. What we call light is in my view theperception prison – the Matrix Hack. I have felt this for many years and it justbecomes ever more obvious to me. What an extraordinary example of Archoninversion and reversal. You boot up your fake-reality information fields andgenetically manipulate your targets to decode only that Hack. Once you have donethat the House wins every time and how could that not be the case when themind-magicians are the only ones who know? Well, until now. If you look at theBible’s symbolic Creation narrative there appear to be two distinct forms oflight. The first is the ‘Let there be light’ variety, but it is only on thefourth day here that we get the sunlight:> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the> day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,> and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give> light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the> greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made> the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light> upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the> light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the> morning were the fourth day – Genesis 1:14-19I was out for a walk the other day when I turned a corner and found myselflooking straight into the Sun. I couldn’t see a thing except for a very brightlight any more than I would see anything in the dark. Everyone will haveexperienced this at some time when they are in a car and the driver is blindedby the Sun – blinded by the light. While that happens literally here and there,I say that it is happening metaphorically throughout a human lifetime – in factnot even metaphorically, really. It is the energy source that allows us todecode our own prison by reflecting off the bars so that we can ‘see’ our prisoncells without realising that this is what we are. Yes, the word ‘cells’ is veryappropriate because our genetics are encoded to decode the Archon-generatedAlcatraz. Some of the cells can be horrible with cities teeming with inmates;some can be decorated with forests, lakes and seascapes; but they are all thesame collective prison designed to keep us occupied by survival or ambitionuntil the biblical three-score-years-and-ten are out of the way and the nextintake can move in. Within this fake reality we have scientists trying to workout how everything works, but they are observing and dissecting a manufacturedillusion. When they do that without an awareness of where they are they candisappear so far up their own backside that they need to carry a torch.Mainstream science and much of alternative science investigates reality from theperspective that it is real, and so they can’t understand all the apparentcontradictions and anomalies. This first-base mistake means that nothing elsewill make any sense. It is not ‘real’ – it is a manufactured reality which isadjusted as necessary to maintain the illusion."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00486.jpg]The Moon is not a Balloon ... but ...Yes: I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find his way bymoonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of theworld.Oscar WildeI remember reading the autobiography of the British actor David Niven many yearsago. It was a very funny book called The Moon’s a Balloon and the title wasinspired by a film that he made in which they used a balloon as the Moon. Iguess it was seriously low budget. Our Moon may not be a balloon, but it is nota natural body either, or at least not entirely. The Moon is not the result ofillusory ‘evolution’ – it is a construct (Fig 214).I have detailed at length the endless anomalies, contradictions andgeometrical/mathematical synchronicities of the Moon in Human Race Get Off YourKnees and I will present a summary here for the context of this book. The ‘Moon’sequence of insight began for me when I sat down at the computer one morningwhile writing Human Race. I heard a clear ‘voice’ or thought pass through mymind which said words to the effect of ‘the Moon’s not real’ and ‘it’s not whatyou think it is’. I had questioned the nature of the Moon here and there overthe years and whether it was natural, but from this moment at the computer theinformation to that effect quickly began to come my way. This was a sequencethat I have experienced over and over since the communication through BettyShine in 1990. A subject will enter my life and suddenly information on thatsubject will be coming at me from all angles. That morning I immediately put afew words into a search engine along the lines of ‘unnatural or fake Moon’ (butthen what is natural and unnatural in a virtual reality game?) and up came abook called Who Built The Moon? by researchers Christopher Knight and AlanButler. I read it with great interest when it arrived in the post a couple ofdays later. Knight and Butler contended – rightly – that the Moon cannot be anatural body and they highlighted the amazing anomalies andgeometrical/mathematical synchronicity between Earth, the Sun and the Moon. Thisdoes not apply to the other bodies in the solar system – only the Earth, Moonand Sun. Interestingly, the Gnostic texts indicate that the Archons controlledthe wider solar system of ‘dead’ or ‘inorganic’ planets (and I say dwarf stars)but that the Earth, Moon and Sun were a separate three-body system which theDemiurge/Archons didn’t control – but were trying to. These are some of thesynchronicities detailed in Who Built The Moon?:[../Images/00505.jpg]Figure 214: We can see the Moon, but not what goes on inside.[../Images/00173.jpg]Figure 215: What are the chances of a ‘natural moon’ being the same size as theSun when viewed from Earth at a solar eclipse?> • The Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, and at a solar eclipse it is> 400 times closer to Earth. This makes the Moon appear from Earth to be the> same size as the Sun during a total eclipse (Fig 215).> • The Sun is at its lowest and weakest in mid-winter when the Moon is at its> highest and brightest. The reverse happens in mid-summer. They set at the same> point on the horizon at the equinoxes and at the opposite point at the> solstices.> • Earth rotates 366.259 times during one orbit of the Sun. The polar> circumference of the Earth is 366.175 times bigger than that of the Moon. The> polar circumference of the Moon is 27.31percent the size of Earth and the Moon> makes 27.396 turns per orbit of the Earth.> • Multiply the circumference of the Moon by that of Earth and you get 436,669> kilometres. If this number is divided by 100 it becomes 436,669 kilometres –> the circumference of the Sun correct to 99.9 percent.> • Divide the circumference of the Sun by that of the Moon and multiply by> 100, and you get the circumference of the Earth. Divide the size of the Sun by> the size of the Earth and multiply by 100 and you get the size of the Moon.[../Images/00451.jpg]Figure 216: The Earth, Moon and Sun connections are ‘nothing less thanstaggering’.Knight and Butler say with great justification in the circumstances that theserelationships between the Earth, Moon and Sun are ‘nothing less than staggering’and that the Moon has been positioned ‘with the accuracy of the proverbial Swisswatchmaker’ (Fig 216). Scientists say that life as we know it would beimpossible if the Moon was nearer or further away than it is now. A BBCdocumentary in 2011 called Do We Really Need the Moon? highlighted thisextraordinary fact, but waved it away as a coincidence. I love these coincidencetheorists – fully paid-up members of Naivety Anonymous. But then mainstreamscientists rely on the Coincidence Doctrine to stay on message. Once they startinvestigating with an open mind and in a true spirit of discovery the phonestops ringing and the funding dries up. I guess it is also a coincidence that weonly ever see one side of the Moon which provides perfect cover for what goes onwhere the Sun don’t shine, or where we never see it shine. We are told that theone-face Moon is caused by the fact that the Earth rotates at a speed 400 timesfaster than the Moon and spins 40,000 kilometres on its axis in a day to theMoon’s 400. Somewhere in those numbers, so we are told, is the reason that weonly ever see one side of the Moon from Earth. I have seen some suggestions thatthe Moon doesn’t spin at all. We have to be very careful about taking anythingas fact from official sources when the biggest spin of the lot is coming fromNASA. The Archons have a whole global network of Archon-human hybridsmanipulating our reality on their behalf. One of their interlockingorganisations is NASA and so we need to be very wary of anything from thatsource. Not all of the information it publishes will be wrong, but enough tokeep people off the scent. Some more open-minded scientists have acknowledgedthat the Moon makes no sense at all. For example, the Moon is 2,160 miles indiameter – bigger than Pluto – and the fifth largest moon in the solar systemdespite all those giant ‘planets’ (dwarf stars) such as Saturn and Jupiter. OurMoon is a quarter the size of Earth and there is no moon in the solar systemthat comes close to the same size ratio of planet to satellite. Irwin Shapiro,from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, went as far as to say:‘The best explanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon doesn’texist.’ Knight and Butler write in Who Built The Moon?:> The Moon is bigger than it should be, apparently older than it should be and> much lighter in mass than it should be. It occupies an unlikely orbit and is> so extraordinary that all existing explanations for its presence are fraught> with difficulties and none of them could be considered remotely watertight.The song sheet explanation for the Moon is that a Mars-type planet struck theEarth during its formation and a large chunk of the Earth broke away to becomethe Moon. This so-called ‘Big Whack Theory’ had more holes or craters than theMoon itself and it was revised to become the ‘Double Big Whack Theory’ whichsuggests that the Marstype planet gave the Earth a smack and then came back andhad another pop. Anyone got a shoe horn to make the story fit? Earl Ubell, aformer science editor with CBS, was right when he said that the contrastingmetallic make-up of the Earth and Moon made nonsense of the idea that they werecreated at the same time, or near each other or from each other. ‘Thedifferences suggest that Earth and Moon came into being far from each other, anidea that stumbles over the inability of astrophysicists to explain how exactlythe Moon became a satellite of Earth’, he said. Another fact that demolishes theofficial theory: they say that the Moon is a chunk of the still-forming Earthbut some moon rocks have been dated at a billion years older than anything foundon Earth. Other moon rocks have been found to be of a different composition tothe dust in which they were lying with the dust once again a billion yearsolder. Dr Lon Hood, who leads the Moon research team at Arizona University, saidthat their work ‘really does add weight to the idea that the Moon’s origin isunique, unlike any other terrestrial body – Earth, Venus, Mars or Mercury’.Here are just some of the legion of other Moon mysteries:> • The Moon is said to have next to no magnetic field, but Moon rocks are> magnetised.> • Some rocks contain processed metals, such as brass and mica, and the> elements neptunium 237 and uranium 236 which do not occur naturally. Neptunium> 237 is a radioactive metallic element, a by-product of nuclear reactors and> the production of plutonium. Uranium 236 is a long-living radioactive nuclear> waste that is found in spent nuclear fuel and reprocessed uranium. What is> this doing on a ‘natural’ moon?> • The Moon is said once to have been part of the Earth, but some lunar rocks> contain ten times more titanium than found on Earth and Dr Harold C Urey,> winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, said he was ‘terribly puzzled by the> rocks from the Moon and in particular their titanium content.’ He said that> the rocks were ‘mind-blowers’.> • Geochemist Dr S Ross Taylor, who led the lunar chemical analysis team, said> that areas of the Moon the size of Texas were covered with melted rock> containing fluid titanium and he could not explain how the heat was generated> to do this. Titanium just happens to be used in supersonic jets, deep-diving> submarines and spacecraft.> • Moon craters are extraordinarily shallow no matter what the size of the> apparent impact and Dr Don L Anderson, a professor of geophysics and director> of the seismological laboratory at the California Institute of Technology,> once said that ‘the Moon is made inside out’. What is outside should be> inside.It’s a ‘spacescraft’All these apparent mysteries and anomalies can be explained if, as I stronglysuggest, the Moon is a gigantic construct – possibly a hollowed out planetoid orjust as possibly a ‘click, click – enter’ within the virtual reality ‘universe’.It is important to keep in mind that in a virtual reality situation anything canbe inserted into the ‘game’ and we are talking about an interactive game inwhich holographic information of compatible frequencies would be decoded as‘physical’ and could be walked upon, ‘lived in’, and changed around. I say thatthe Moon functions inside as a computer and receiver-transmitter system thatamplifies the Saturn transmissions specifically for the Earth. This is not theonly way the Moon can be used or has ever been used. I suggest that it has beenhijacked by the Archontic conspiracy and is in the process of being taken backfor the benefit of humanity. Nor am I alone in suggesting that the Moon is aconstruct of some kind. There are the authors of Who Built The Moon? for a startand then there is Mikhail Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, two members of theSoviet Academy of Sciences, who wrote a detailed article in the Soviet Sputnikmagazine in 1970 called Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence? Theirconclusion was that the Moon is a hollowed-out planetoid and this fits with theMoon being ‘inside out’ in terms of the extremely hard lunar surface. The Sovietscientists said that the Moon is controlled from inside where a largecivilisation could have lived since the hollowing-out process. Zulu legendsabout the Moon say that it was hollowed out by two brothers, Wowane and Mpanku,the leaders of the reptilian Chitauri. This is the same theme found in theSumerian Tablets which describe how two brothers, Enlil and Enki, were leadersof the Anunnaki. Zulu accounts say that Wowane and Mpanku stole the Moon fromthe ‘Great Fire Dragon’ in the form of an egg and hollowed out the ‘yoke’. Thesymbolism of the Moon as an egg was common in the ancient world. The Babyloniangoddess/queen, Semiramis or Ishtar, was said to have come from the Moon in a‘giant moon egg’ and landed in the Euphrates River. This later became known as‘Ishtar’s (Easter’s) egg’ and here we have the origin of Easter eggs today.Scientists connected to NASA have also wondered if the Moon is hollow. Dr GordonMacDonald, a NASA scientist, said in the 1960s that ‘it would seem that the Moonis more like a hollow than a homogeneous sphere’. Dr Sean C Solomon of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) conceded that the evidence pointedto the ‘frightening possibility that the Moon might be hollow’. Acclaimedcosmologist Carl Sagan, who wrote the book Dragons of Eden about the effect ofreptilian genetics on human behaviour, said that ‘a natural satellite cannot bea hollow object’. NASA scientists struck the Moon with a blow equivalent to onetonne of TNT after seismometers had been installed and they said that the Moon‘rang like a bell’. Maurice Ewing, a co-director of the seismic experiment, saidthat he could not explain this. ‘It is as though someone had struck a bell, say,in the belfry of a church, a single blow and found that the reverberation fromit continued for 30 minutes’, he said. Dr Frank Press from the MIT said it was‘quite beyond the range of our experience’ for such a small impact to producethis result. The Moon was later struck with the equivalent of 11 tonnes of TNTand NASA scientists said the Moon ‘reacted like a gong’. The vibrationscontinued for three hours and twenty minutes to a depth of 25 miles. KenJohnson, a supervisor of the Data and Photo Control Department during the Apollomissions, said that the Moon not only rang like a bell, but the whole Moon‘wobbled’ so precisely that it was ‘almost as though it had gigantic hydraulicdamper struts inside it’. When a meteor hit the Moon in 1972 with the equivalentof 200 tonnes of TNT the shockwaves surged into the interior, but none cameback. They seem to love giving the Moon a good smack and you can bet than whenthey ‘bombed the Moon’ in 2009 it was not to see if it had water as NASAclaimed. They also announced in 2010 on the NASA website, after analysis ofimages from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, that the Moon wasshrinking and that ‘newly discovered cliffs in the lunar crust indicate the Moonshrank globally in the geologically recent past and might still be shrinkingtoday’. Scientists have long been bewildered about the unusual nature andbehaviour of lunar soil and in 2012 soil scientist Marek Zbik at the QueenslandUniversity of Technology discovered nanoparticles in lunar soil inside bubblesof glass. ‘We were really surprised at what we found’, Dr Zbik said. ‘Instead ofgas or vapour inside the bubbles, which we would expect to find in such bubbleson Earth, the lunar glass bubbles were filled with a highly porous network ofalien-looking glassy particles that span the bubbles’ interior.’ We already hadall these ‘coincidences’, mysteries and anomalies surrounding the Moon and thenthey find that it has nanoparticles in the soil with extraordinary properties.This gives supports to the Soviet scientists who said in 1970 that the Moon wassome sort of artificial construct. They said that the Moon had been hollowed outto create a home for potentially a considerable civilisation inside and thisexplained the ‘metallic rocky slag’ on the lunar surface and the uranium 236 andneptunium 237 given that nuclear technology was likely to have been involved. Itwould further solve the mystery of the areas the size of Texas covered withmelted rock containing titanium and the chromium and zirconium. All these areknown as ‘refractory’ metals which are extremely resistant to heat and wear andare perfect for the protection of the outer shell and those inside. The Sovietscientists wrote that this would ensure ‘enviable resistance to heat and theability to stand up to means of aggression’ such as the unfavourable effects oftemperature, cosmic radiation and meteorite bombardment. They said that if youwere designing a craft for this purpose these are precisely the metals you woulduse and this explains why lunar rock is such a poor conductor of heat. It wasmade that way. Vasin and Shcherbakov said that from an engineers’ point of view‘this spaceship of ages long past, which we call the Moon, is superblyconstructed’:> If you are going to launch an artificial sputnik, then it is advisable to make> it hollow. At the same time it would be naïve to imagine that anyone capable> of such a tremendous space project would be satisfied simply with some kind of> giant empty trunk hurled into a near-Earth trajectory.> It is more likely that what we have here is a very ancient spaceship, the> interior of which was filled with fuel for the engines, materials and> appliances for repair work, navigation instruments, observation equipment and> all manner of machinery ... in other words, everything necessary to enable> this ‘caravelle of the universe’ to serve as a kind of Noah’s Ark of> intelligence, perhaps even as the home of a whole civilisation envisaging a> prolonged (thousands of millions of years) existence and long wanderings> through space (thousands of millions of miles).> Naturally, the hull of such a spaceship must be super-tough in order to stand> up to the blows of meteorites and sharp fluctuations between extreme heat and> extreme cold. Probably the shell is a double-layered affair – the basis a> dense armouring of about 20 miles in thickness, and outside it some kind of> more loosely-packed covering (a thinner layer – averaging about three miles).> In certain areas – where the lunar ‘seas’ and ‘craters’ are, the upper layer> is quite thin, in some cases, non-existent.This would dissolve another mystery of why lunar craters are of such a uniformdepth no matter how wide and powerful was the impact. The cosmic journeys of theMoon would explain the vastly different ages of Moon rocks and dust, thescientists said. The Moon is a construct and it is far from the only example inthe solar system. More and more questions are being asked about the origin ofthe Saturn moon, Iapetus, discovered in 1671 by astronomer and astrologerGiovanni Domenico Cassini. Iapetus follows an orbit some two million miles fromSaturn. It is Saturn’s third-biggest moon, the eleventh-biggest in the solarsystem and a place of mystery and anomaly – just like Earth’s Moon. One side ofIapetus is ‘as dark as asphalt’ and the other ‘as white as snow’ and this iscaused by the duel nature of the surface, not reflected light (Fig 217). Thereis also an incredible and unexplained ‘wall’, or ridge, up to 12 miles high(Mount Everest is 5.5 miles) and 124 miles wide which bisects Iapetus for 800 ofits 900 mile diameter almost exactly along the equator (Fig 218). The ridge hasled to Iapetus being dubbed the ‘walnut’, but no explanation is given for whatcaused this ridge to form. Nothing like this can be found on any other moon ofthe solar system and researcher Richard Hoagland rightly said on his websiteenterprisemission.com [http://www.enterprisemission.com]: ‘There is no viablegeological model to explain a sixty thousand-foot-high, sixtythousand-foot-wide, four million-foot-long “wall” ... spanning an entireplanetary hemisphere ... let alone, located in the precise plane of itsequator!’ There are also clearly non-natural rectangular and square box-likestructures scattered over thousands of square miles in the area where the lightside meets the dark side (Fig 219). Iapetus has hexagonal craters just as Saturnhas its hexagon polar storm. The Iapetus ‘moon’ is constructed with straightridges or planes and is a flattened out or squashed shape rather than a sphere.It unusually orbits Saturn in very nearly a circle (our Moon is not that far offeither) and it always shows the same face to Saturn (as our Moon always showsthe same face to Earth). I have been saying for some years that Earth’s Moon isakin to the Death Star featured in the Star Wars movies of Cabal insider, GeorgeLucas. The Death Star was a construct within which lived Darth Vader, thesymbolic ‘fallen angel’ dressed in pitch black – classic colour symbolism forSaturn. This is made even more interesting when you consider the remarkablelikeness between the Death Star and Iapetus and the same applies to the DeathStar and Mimas, another moon of Saturn (Fig 220). Richard Hoagland, a long-timeresearcher of space anomalies and NASA deceit, wrote:[../Images/00484.jpg]Figure 217: Two-tone Iapetus.[../Images/00364.jpg]Figure 218: The Iapetus ridge.[../Images/00466.jpg]Figure 219: The strange rectangles and boxes over thousands of square miles onIapetus.[../Images/00212.jpg]Figure 220: Iapetus, the Death Star and Mimas.> Once the (amazing) possibility is admitted that Iapetus could be an artificial> ‘moon’ – and may have been deliberately inserted into such an odd orbit – the> ‘coincidental’ nature of its unique, steep inclination (relative to the other> similar-sized Saturnian moons – Dione, Rhea, etc.) goes away. But, equally> ‘coincidental’ is the shape of Iapetus’ inclined orbit ... and its precise> distance from Saturn.> Iapetus’ orbit is extremely close to being circular -- with an eccentricity of> only 0.0283 – departing from a perfect circle by slightly less than 3%.

So many themes of the story can be found in Hollywood scripts suchas the 2012 movie Prometheus which was named after a mythical Archon ‘hero’ andthis is also the name of another Saturn ‘moon’. The film featured a group ofhumans sometime in the ‘future’ visiting a far-off moon to find theextraterrestrial race said to have created humans and you could see clearly inthe sky a body that looked exactly like Saturn. The badge of the crew alsofeatured Saturn (Fig 221). The film was extremely reptilian in theme with ahuman researcher aborting a reptilian child and the final shot of the filmfeaturing a reptilian entity as the punch line (Fig 222). The moon featured inthe film is supposed to be in the Zeta Reticula system which is the alleged homeof the classic ‘Grey’ aliens. Director Ridley Scott said that he had beeninspired by the writings of Swiss author Erich von Daniken, the pioneer of thetheme of ancient aliens visiting Earth, but the constantly misleading theme isthat humans were created by the non-human entities we are talking about. Theywere not. The human body was distorted, rewired and programmed, but not createdfrom scratch. Hollywood in general is preparing people for what is planned – theunveiling of the true masters if we allow the global police state to reach apoint of full lockdown. There has been speculation for some time that Phobos, amoon of Mars, may not be what it seems either (Fig 223). Dr Iosif SamuilovichShklovsky, a Russian astrophysicist, is reported to have said in 1959 thatPhobos could be an artificial satellite in view of its strange orbit andindications that it could be hollow. Raymond H Wilson Jr, Chief of AppliedMathematics at NASA, said in 1963 that ‘Phobos might be a colossal base orbitingMars’ and that this possibility was being considered by NASA. More recently, in2010, the Mars Express, a European spacecraft, took a series of close-uppictures of Phobos and the BBC’s The Sky at Night programme reported that‘Phobos is lighter than it should be, could be hollow, and its composition isnot like any asteroids or meteorites that we know of’. How many of Saturn’smoons are constructs and ‘spacecraft’ rather than natural phenomena? In fact, Iask the same question about other bodies, too.[../Images/00338.jpg]Figure 223: Phobos – another unnatural moon?Thumbs upOne of the consistent themes in my life since my conscious awakening to theworld as it really is in 1990 follows a sequence of communicating someapparently far-out concept and information and then a few months or so latersomething happening to confirm its accuracy to me. About nine months after Ifirst wrote about the artificial Moon and its function in Human Race Get offYour Knees I had an email from a lady in Brazil. She said that she had read thebook and thought that I would be interested in a book called Earth featuringinformation channelled through an American, Barbara Marciniak. The differencebetween a psychic and a channel is that, basically, psychics hear or seecommunications and pass them on mostly in their own words while a channel allowsentities/awareness to speak directly through them. I had met Barbara a few timesand I liked her. She seemed to have her feet firmly grounded and she wasn’t offwith the fairies like some who claim to channel communications from otherrealities. I had read her book, the excellent Bringers of the Dawn, but notEarth. I actually had a copy at one time but never got round to reading it to myrecollection. Anyway, my intuition told me to send for the book and when itarrived I followed the page numbers listed by the lady in Brazil. I had a laugh,I can tell you, as I read the words. The consciousness/awareness speakingthrough Barbara said:> ... the Moon is a very powerful electromagnetic computer ... The energy from> the Moon has been beaming electromagnetic frequencies onto the Earth for aeons> now to maintain the two-stranded DNA [it is said to have been twelve-stranded> before the genetic hijack, as I mentioned earlier].> The Moon is a satellite that was constructed ... [and] anchored outside> Earth’s atmosphere for aeons as a mediating and monitoring device, a super> computer or eye in the sky ...> ... Earth must be owned by those who dwell there; however it is not. You have> outside gods, creator energies, who prevent you, as a species, from having> free reign with your kundalini [potential to awaken to the true self].> The influence of the Moon, as a main satellite computer, affects all of the> Earth ... The Moon’s programs have for aeons been of great limitation toward> human beings ... There are repetitive cycles that the Moon creates, to which> you respond.The Moon creates the ‘repetitive cycles’ of repeating and ritualistic behaviourbecause it is beaming out the frequency of the Hack, the Matrix. Humans respondbecause they are decoding those repeating patterns through their DNA receiversand the programs within junk or non-coding DNA which the Matrix activates. Thisis excellently captured in artist Neil Hague’s concept of ‘Moonopoly’ (Fig 224).About the same time that I read Barbara’s book I also saw a quote from theArmenian-born mystic George Gurdjieff which he said in 1916:> All movements, actions and manifestations of people, animals and plants depend> upon the Moon, and we are controlled by the Moon ... The mechanical part of> our lives depends upon the Moon, is subject to the Moon. If we develop in> ourselves consciousness and will, and subject our mechanical self and all our> mechanical manifestations to them, we shall escape the power of the Moon.[../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 224: Moonopoly – another version of the hamster wheel.When our attention is only in Body-Mind we are puppets of the Matrix directedfrom Saturn via the Moon; when we open our minds to Consciousness we begin toescape the influence of the Matrix because our point of attention and perceptionmoves beyond its frequency range. I read an article while I was writing my lastbook, Remember Who You Are, which described a secret project called ChannelledHolographic Access Network Interface, or the ‘Chani Project’ for short. It wasanother of those synchronistic moments because my former wife and greatestfriend, Linda, who owns the company that publishes my books, brought the articleto me just as I was writing the section about the Moon. The Chani group areclaimed to have used advanced technology located in Africa to communicate withan entity in another dimension or reality for five years from 1994 during whichtime some 20,000 questions are said to have been asked, according to the sourcebehind the article in Nexus magazine. The entity was quoted in the article assaying:> • Life was better for humans before the Moon came.> • ‘Moon forces’ control time and manipulate the mood of humans.> • The Moon is there to control the Earth’s ‘mood’ and a big calm would come> over the Earth without the Moon – there would only be little storms, not big> storms.> • The ‘old race’ [Archons] captured the Moon from space and located it next> to the Earth.> • A reptilian race was holding back humans so they couldn’t ‘grow’.> • The entity said they had fought many battles against the reptile race in> their own reality.> • Humans were more evolved spiritually than the reptiles but they suppress> humans with their technology – ‘their god is their technology’.I had been saying all this for years in my books and it was interesting to seethe same themes apparently emerge from this Chani project. Look at the pointsthat are made here. The Moon (the Matrix) controls and manipulates time. Yes, inconjunction with Saturn. It manipulates the mood of humans. Yes, by triggeringemotional programs and destabilising hormonal balance through its impact uponthe endocrine system of glands which connect with the chakras and the glandularfunction of the heart. The Moon’s presence and influence is known to have afundamental impact on human hormone activity which triggers emotional states.The endocrine system includes the pineal and pituitary glands of the ‘third eye’and the influence of the broadcasts from the Moon can suppress the potential forhumans to expand perception beyond the five senses – precisely what the Archonsare seeking to do. Many studies have confirmed that different phases of the Mooncan affect human behaviour – especially the full moon. The term ‘lunatics’ comesthis lunar effect. The Moon is behind the movement of the tides and influencesthe body in the same way because it is 70 percent water. The old race (theGnostic texts say the Archons were here ‘from the beginning’) captured the Moonand located it next to the Earth. Yes. A reptilian race is holding back humansso they can’t ‘grow’. Yes. They had fought many battles against the reptile racein their own reality. Yes. I have been saying for years that theArchon-Reptilians are not only seeking to enslave humanity and the Earth. Humanswere more evolved spiritually than the reptiles but they suppress humans withtheir technology – ‘their god is their technology’. Yes. They are terrified ofhumanity waking up to what is happening and they use technology to overcometheir inability to create directly through the creative imagination and‘intentionality’ which they don’t possess. The Gnostic texts from 2,000 yearsago said that the Archons hated humans because they envied the abilities thathumans potentially have compared with their own. The Chani communications alsotalked about life being better for humans before the Moon came and, in fact, thepre-Moon Earth is described in similar terms to what we see in the Avatar movie.Ancient tribal peoples have told of a time before the Moon and these include theProselenes in Arcadia, Greece. Greek authors, Aristotle and Plutarch, and Romanauthors, Apollonius Rhodius and Ovid, report how the Proselenes claimed thattheir ancestors had been there ‘before there was a moon in the heavens’. Theword ‘Proselene’ means ‘before Selene’, the Greek goddess of the Moon. Selenewas a daughter of Titans according to Greek mythology and the name is also usedas a name for the Moon. I have explained in Human Race Get Off Your Knees why Icontend that ‘before Selene’ also means ‘before saline’. I don’t accept that theworld’s oceans have always been salty and imagine the abundance there would beon Earth if they consisted of fresh water. African legends tell of the time thatthe oceans became salty. To change the waters from fresh to saline would requireonly a change in the information encoded at the waveform level or somecatastrophe that delivered the salt ‘en masse’. It just so happens that thosewho have studied the Saturn-Jupiter confrontation suggest that the consequencesled to Saturn, then close to the Earth, unleashing staggering amounts of waterthat caused the Great Flood of universal legend. Immanuel Velikovsky predictedthat Saturn will be found to contain water with molecular chlorine and this isfound in the Earth’s oceans without any credible natural explanation. Velikovskywrote:> The water of the oceans contains a large amount of soluble sodium chloride,> common salt. Sodium might have come from rocks eroded by rain; but rocks are> poor in chlorine and the proportion of sodium and chlorine in sea water calls> for fifty times more chlorine in the igneous rock than it actually contains.There is something very important in human suppression that relates to salt.Just as the oceans were turned to salt so the human diet today produced byArchon corporations includes fantastic amounts of salt and the body is some 70percent water.NAZI NASAThere are endless reasons why the controlling force behind NASA should never bebelieved without question. One is that the whole operation was established byNazis which were controlled by the Archon secret society and satanic networks.Hundreds of Nazi scientists and geneticists escaped to America and South Americaat the end of the war to continue their dastardly deeds thanks to Archoncreated-and-controlled Intelligence networks and the Roman Catholic Church. Theycombined in a top-secret project known as Operation Paperclip which arranged forthe covert passage of ‘useful’ Nazis to the Americas. Many of these Nazis werethe founders of NASA (NAZI) and one was Wernher von Braun, a German rocketscientist and member of the Nazi Party who designed the V-2 rockets that werefired at Britain in World War II. He later became the leading rocket engineer atNASA and largely designed the Saturn V booster rocket that propelled Apollospacecraft in the Moon missions. NASA is controlled by the military-Intelligencehierarchy whatever they may say officially and their goal is to keep the peoplein the dark about anything that would be truly enlightening to know – especiallythe existence of the Archons and the Matrix. The Nazis brought with them toAmerica their knowledge of ‘anti-gravity technology’ (actually electromagnetictechnology), widely known as ‘UFOs’ or ‘flying saucers’, and most of the ‘alien’craft that people genuinely see are flown by humans. The real extraterrestrialsand interdimensionals largely have technology far beyond that. The UFO researchcommunity has been awash with intelligence operatives over the decades to divertand block and there are plenty of naive UFO ‘researchers’ who they have notrouble misleading and misdirecting. There are, however, some highly intelligentpeople in that research arena, too, thank goodness. I have detailed in otherbooks how former NASA employees, and those who worked under contract, haverevealed over the years that ‘alien’ bases exist on the far side of the Moon.Among them was Ken Johnston, former manager of the NASA Data and Photo ControlDepartment, who worked for the Lunar Receiving Laboratory during the Apollomissions. He told how he saw pictures taken by Apollo 14 in 1971 that showed acluster of domes in a crater on the far side of the Moon. He said that the domeswere in shadow, but were generating their own light. He said that later he sawpeople ‘painting’ on film negatives and asked what they were doing. A woman withthem said: ‘We are painting out the horizon on the Moon because the stars wouldconfuse people and we don’t want them to get confused with the little specks oflight.’ The next day the dome images were no longer on the film. A group ofpeople with similar experiences to Ken Johnson were gathered together to telltheir stories at the National Press Club in Washington in 2001. They describedhow NASA systematically doctors pictures to smudge over or air-brush non-naturalphenomena and whole ‘alien bases’ on the far side of the Moon. Donna Hare, whoworked on contract for NASA, said that images of extraterrestrial craft andnon-natural objects and anomalies on Mars and the Moon were airbrushed outbefore being made public. NASA have even admitted doing this, in one caseinvolving a Saturn moon, but they make the excuse of making a better image. Someblatantly smudged images include towers on the Moon and what looks like trulymassive technology (Figs 225, 226, 227 and 228). It is important again toemphasise that big to us is not big to others with vastly superior technologyand knowledge of how to manipulate reality. Some of the earlier doctored imageswere quite poorly done but these days it is far more sophisticated usingstate-of-the-art imaging technology. NASA did produce a detailed report in the1960s (NASA TR R-277) which listed 570 events witnessed through a telescope bymore than 300 people between 1500 and 1967. These included mysterious mists,colours, extremely bright lights, intermittent lights, streaks of light,unexplained shadows and what was thought to be some kind of ‘volcanic’ activity.One of these locations was the Aristarchus Crater in the southern region of theMoon. Bright lights have been reported here since the 17th century and astructure has since been found at that location 29 miles in diameter and whichglows electric blue. It has been named the ‘Blue Gem’ or ‘Blue Dome’ (Fig 229).There has been speculation that it is some kind of nuclear complex and itcertainly fits with the points I made earlier that while humans were knockingrocks together, or in this case peering through limited telescopes while wearingwigs and breeches, the Archon- Reptilians were using advanced technology wellbeyond anything that humans even have now. See Human Race Get off Your Knees formore about the NASA whistle-blowers and what they claim to have seen.[../Images/00304.jpg]Figs 225, 226, 227 and 228: Smudged-out towers and other non-natural phenomenaon the Moon. There is even what is said to be some form of statue.[../Images/00522.jpg]Figure 229: The ‘Blue Gem’ in the Aristarchus CraterIt may seem contradictory to say that the Archons use advanced technology andreality-manipulation techniques, while lacking creative imagination or‘intentionality’, but it isn’t. Everything is relative in the sense of advancedtechnology and techniques compared with the capabilities of fast-asleephumanity. But it is as nothing compared with the gifts available to a wide-awakehumanity, the like of which has not been seen in known human history. Thepotential of the Archons is minimal compared with a humanity fully awakened tothe Awareness of the true self. The Archons compensate for this throughtechnology that is not advanced at all in the greater scheme of InfinitePossibility and by maintaining incarnate humanity in a state of severeignorance. In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king. The Archons arethe one-eyed man and they have made humans blind – until now."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00117.jpg]Saturn SocietyTo live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.Oscar WildeNow, given what I have said so far can it really be a coincidence or by chancethat the worship of Saturn is at the core of all the major religions, secretsocieties and Satanism, and is expressed through all the institutions of state?Or that the same is true of the ancient world? Or that the Moon is right upthere, too, in terms of their focus?A few coincidence theorists will try to convince themselves to believe so ortheir concrete belief systems will be reduced to rubble; but those in any sortof connection with their own perception – rather than one delivered as a job lot– will surely be asking: Why the obsession with Saturn? And how come that allthese apparently diverse and unconnected institutions and groupings likereligion, secret societies, Satanism and the institutions of state share thesame obsession and focus of worship, overtly or covertly? Well, the answers comefrom what Saturn is and what Saturn does: 1) Saturn is a Consciousness, anAwareness or entity that can be worshipped as a ‘god’ (just as others likeJupiter were and are); and (2) Saturn is an expression of the Demiurge (Satan,the Devil, Lucifer) which, through the networks of the Archons, establishedthose religions, secret societies, Satanism and institutions of state. They areall pillars of a multi-faceted Demiurge-Archon Control System designed to hijackhuman perception. So, of course, they would all worship the same deity or symbol– Saturn – although the great majority of religious advocates and followers arenever told that. They don’t know that religion was established so that humanscould worship the Demiurge as their ‘god’ under different names like ‘the Lord’(Lord Archon), Yahweh/Jehovah and Allah. The congregations are worshipping whatthey have convinced themselves to be a loving god (though the evidence is allthe other way if you read books like the Old Testament) when they are actuallyworshipping a symbol of ‘evil’ and control. Talk about inversion. Nice one, Dem.It’s horrible, yes, but very clever in a ‘have I shown you my new card trick’sort of way. Saturn is encoded in ancient religions, secret societies andSatanism as the ‘Old Sun’, ‘Dark Sun’, ‘Dark Lord’, and simply ‘The Lord’ (theDemiurge). For the Archon networks passing through human ‘history’ it has been acase of ‘have Saturn, will travel’. I will explain in the next chapter how anetwork of specifically-created bloodline families representing the Archons inapparently human form have been expanding their power and influence over humanaffairs for thousands of years in our perception of ‘time’. They were seeded allover the world and they have taken their worship of Saturn and the Demiurgewherever they have travelled and located. They have a hybrid Archon-humangenetics and these are the families today under many and various names thatcontrol global religions, secret societies, Satanism, governments, the bankingsystem, transnational corporations, mainstream media and the cartels ofpharmaceuticals, oil, biotech and food production along with much else.Saturn through the agesAncient Babylon, the former Sumer/Mesopotamia and now called Iraq, was a majorcentre for these Archon bloodlines and the Babylonians worshipped their ‘sungod’ (Dark Sun god) Nimrod as Saturn. So many pieces fall into place when yourealise that the ancient and universal stories and myths about sun gods, whichhave quite understandably been taken to be our Sun or ‘solar orb’, are actuallysymbols of Saturn (Fig 230). In the same way, the symbol in Figure 231 hasalways been considered an ancient symbol of ‘our’ Sun, but then why would thesymbol be a dot and a circle? Look at the Saturn formation before the cataclysm,however, and it all makes sense (Fig 232). Saturn was worshipped as Nimrod, or‘Ninurta’, in Mesopotamia and as ‘Shani’ in the Hindu world. The Archonbloodlines migrated from Babylon and its one-time empire to establish Rome andits empire. The Romans worshipped the Babylonian Nimrod in the form of their god‘Saturn’, or ‘Saturnus’. Rome was Babylon relocated and the Roman or ChristianChurch founded by the Romans was the religion of Babylon relocated usingdifferent names for the deities and heroes. Rome was originally known asSaturnia or City of Saturn. The cult of Mithra, the earlier Roman and Persianversion of Jesus, was heavily connected to Saturn. Mithra was the ‘God of Light’(just like Freemasons worship Lucifer ‘the Light Bearer’) and the cult of Mithraalso included grades or degrees of initiation and secret handshakes. In-the-knowFreemasons covertly worship Saturn while the great majority of Masons do sounknowingly. I went to look around the local Freemasons’ lodge where I live atRyde on the Isle of Wight when they had a public open day in July 2012. Ichatted with people who had been Masons for more than 30 years and when I askedthem about the origin of their symbols such as the six-pointed star andall-seeing eye they said they didn’t really know because the symbols go back sofar the origins have been lost. Well, that’s what they are told, but it’s nottrue at all. One said that the all-seeing eye is the ‘Great Architect’ watchingover everything that happens. Yes, Saturn, the Demiurge, and associated forces –the Archon-tect. I asked about the twin pillars symbol of Freemasonry and I gotthe pat answer that they represent the two pillars at the entrance to themythical Solomon’s Temple. What they didn’t know is that Solomon and his‘temple’ represent Saturn, as I will explain later. As I mentioned, thesix-pointed star, a major Saturn symbol and origin of the name Rothschild, isalso known as the Seal of Solomon. You can see that the outside of the Rydelodge is adorned with a multiple symbol of Saturn – the six-pointed star withina circle and a square (Fig 233). There was another Seal of Solomon (Saturn) onthe ceiling of the main temple at the Ryde lodge. It is placed within the ringsof Saturn and consists of six-pyramids around a hexagon with a seventh pyramidin the centre. There is yet another in the temple’s stained-glass window (Figs234 and 235). Saturn symbols generate the energy/sound of what they symboliseand so the Masons are sitting in Saturn energy every time they attend theirgatherings. Ryde was the third Freemasonic lodge that I have seen inside. Thefirst was in Birmingham, England, when it was hosting a public event and Imanaged to slip down into one of the many temples to have a look around; thesecond was a major lodge in Boston, Massachusetts, when we just walked in andkept on walking with no one around to stop us. It was like the Marie Celeste andI managed to get into one of their temples to look around. All of these lodgeshad the same energy that I have felt in so many churches, government buildings(including the UK Houses of Parliament and Washington DC), stately homes,castles and other places of satanic activity. I call this energy‘Saturnic-reptilian’. The window that I photographed in the Ryde lodge wasretrieved from a local church when it was demolished – the same church wherethey found a mummified heart when they removed the altar. Putting a window froma church into a Freemasonic temple because the symbols match is a wonderfulexample of how religion, secret societies and Satanism are all expressions ofthe same thing at different levels of extreme. The Masons that I met at the Rydelodge that day seemed nice enough people, but they did not have a clue what theyare part of – just like the overwhelming majority of other Masons worldwide. Itis not ‘the Freemasons’ as a whole that are involved in the global conspiracy,but the force that uses Freemasonry as a front and a cover for its activities.Freemasonry is an organisation within an organisation with most excluded fromwhat is really going on. Secret societies are incredibly ritualistic andhierarchical – just like Satanism, religion and royalty – because they all servethe same master. Ritualistic and hierarchical behaviour is a trait of thereptilian brain and the whole concept of ritualistic-hierarchical royalty comesfrom the belief that their Archon-human bloodline makes them special with a‘Divine right to rule’. I was told by the Ryde Freemasons how everyone has tosit in a chair designated for their rank in the hierarchy and each has their ownapron that designates their rank. They put one thing around their neck to sit inone chair and something else when they move and sit in another. I stood therementally shaking my head as I was hearing this stuff. At least one secretsociety openly worships Saturn. This is the German-based Fraternitas Saturni, or‘Brotherhood of Saturn’. Stephen E Flowers said in his book, Fire and Ice: TheHistory, Structure, and Rituals of Germany’s Most Influential Modern MagicalOrder: The Brotherhood of Saturn:[../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 230: When you realise that at least most of the ancient sun gods weresymbols of the Saturn sun so much morphs into clarity.[../Images/00089.jpg]Figure 231: The ancient symbol of the ‘Sun’ although there seems to be nonatural reason for that .[../Images/00407.jpg]Figure 232: ... but when you look at Saturn as it appeared from Earth before thecataclysm it all makes sense.[../Images/00513.jpg]Figure 233: The Saturn symbol on the Freemasonic lodge in Ryde, Isle of Wight.[../Images/00207.jpg]Figure 234 and 235: Saturn symbols inside the lodge.> The Fraternitas Saturni (FS), the Brotherhood of Saturn, has become known to> English readers through fragmentary descriptions which emphasize the> sensational, sex-magical aspects of this lodge’s work or else its darker, more> Satanic, side.

The FS represents a unique blend of astrological> cosmology, neo-Gnostic daemonology, sexual occultism, and Freemasonic> organizational principles.Saturn/Santa/SaturnaliaThis is what is really hidden within Satanism, secret societies and the innercore of religion. The ‘new’ Christianity was Saturn worship under another nameand its founder or founding sponsor was the Emperor Constantine who worshipped adeity called Sol Invictus, the ‘Unconquered Sun’, but which sun? I say it wasSaturn and that’s hardly a stretch given that Saturn had been the leading god ofRome. The main ‘Christian’ symbol is the cross that it inherited from the paganworld and you can see the cross in the astrological symbol of Saturn (Fig 236).This cross is also symbolised as a hammer. Christianity absorbed the deities andrituals of Babylonian Saturn-Moon worship and also the festivals. Thecelebration of Easter comes from Babylon and the celebration of the birth of thefable that is ‘Jesus’, or what we call Christmas, is only the Roman festival ofSaturnalia under another name. Saturnalia ran for a week in the period up to thewinter solstice and involved making and giving presents, decorating trees in thehome, hanging sprigs of holly and the omnipresent sacrifice. Today’s Christmasis still a major period for human sacrifice because Satanism is the continuationof a seamless thread of Archon evil passing through what we call history. Santais the focus of Christmas in his red (Saturn/sacrifice outfit) and Santa is ananagram of Satan. He is also referred to as ‘Old Nick’ which is another name forSatan (Saturn). The traditional association between St Nicholas and Santa Clausis complete fiction. Santa evolved from a demon figure once known as ‘Old Pete’and is also connected to the Norse god, Thor (famous for his hit song, If I hada Hammer). Thor has been returned to public attention in modern movies.Christmas is referred to as ‘Yule’ or ‘Yuletide’, but this word comes fromMesopotamia and means ‘Child’s Day’. The evening before was known as ‘Mother’sNight’ – now Christmas Day Eve – and these names originate with the Babyloniangoddess, Semiramis, and her virgin-born son, Tammuz, who was said to be areincarnation of Nimrod, the Saturn god. The fifth century Roman writerMacrobius Ambrosius Theodosius, one of the Roman authors who was not convertedto Christianity, gave detailed accounts of Saturnalia. He said the festival wasa feast of light to mark the time when ‘Saturn suddenly disappeared’. The‘light’ appears to be the light show in the sky just before the cataclysmicevents on Earth when Saturn had its celestial battle with Jupiter. The referenceto ‘disappeared’ relates to Saturn relocating to its present location far awayfrom where it had been before. Roman mythology depicts Saturn as the deity whoreigned over the world in the Golden Age. The Romans and other cultures burnedtorches and candles around their homes to symbolise the light of Saturn. Thishappened in Egypt as well as Rome. The Hebrew Hanukkah (‘To Dedicate’) isanother festival of light in basically the same period of Saturnalia from whichit derived no matter what the cover story might later have become. The Christmasstar, or light in the sky, symbolises Saturn in today’s version of Saturnalia.American occult researcher Fritz Springmeier wrote:[../Images/00290.jpg]Figure 236: The astrological symbol of Saturn.> Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracy> has back to antiquity. The city of Rome was originally known as Saturnia or> City of Saturn. The Roman Catholic Church retains much of the Saturn worship> in its ritual. Saturn also relates to Lucifer. In various occult dictionaries> Saturn is associated with evil.Saturn the ‘Time Lord’ (with a white beard)The Saturn god of the ancient Greeks was known as Chronos or Kronos and so manysymbols and concepts in the modern world come from this (Fig 237). He was aTitan and father of Zeus, according to Greek mythology, and many moons of Saturnare given the names of Titans and Titanesses, as I said before. Chronos was theSaturn god of time. He was depicted as a baby in a manger and as an old beardedman which we call today ‘Old Father Time’ (Fig 238). What we call ‘time’ is onlyfake information broadcast by the Matrix to confuse and imprison our perception.The Matrix is broadcast from Saturn, at least to a significant extent, and theGreeks made Chronos, their god of Saturn, the god and arbiter of time. The name‘Chronos’ actually means ‘time’. Saturn is astrologically (energetically)associated with time and the Moon affects our experience of time by its effecton the spin of the Earth. The entity alleged to have communicated through theChani Project said: ‘Moon forces control time.’ The Moon is often symbolised asa clock face for this reason and you see this at the Vatican and on manycathedrals. The word ‘month’ comes from moon and the female ‘monthly cycle’ isvery much influenced by the Moon as are human hormonal systems in general whichaffect emotions. The image of the white-bearded Chronos (Saturn) can be seen inthe white-bearded Santa Claus; the white-bearded ‘God’ on a cloud; in classicwhite-bearded ‘God’ images and portrayals of the Charlton Heston variety; andthe white-bearded creator of the Matrix in the movie series who was known as theArchitect (Fig 239). These are all symbolising Saturn and the Demiurge – the‘Lord Archon’ or ‘Lord God’. You can see the white-bearded Chronos (Saturn)symbolised in the 1794 painting by British writer, artist, poet and student ofthe esoteric, William Blake, called The Ancient of Days (Fig 240). Chronos isholding the compasses of the architect. A version of The Ancient of Days isportrayed at the entrance to the Archon bloodline-controlled GE building in NewYork with the words ‘Wisdom and knowledge shall be stability of thy times’ (Fig241). The god of Freemasonry is known as the Great Architect of the Universe(the Demiurge/Saturn) although Great Architect of the fake Matrix would benearer the mark (Fig 242). The compasses are one of the central symbols ofFreemasonry because of the Great Architect symbolism, and the Gnostics referredto the Demiurge in terms of ‘The Great Architect of the Universe’ – theArchon-tect. Could it be clearer when these dots are connected that the God ofChristianity (and other religions), Freemasonry and the Ancient Greeks andRomans, Santa Claus, etc., etc., is the Demiurge of the Gnostics – the LordArchon? This is whom the religions, secret societies and Satanism are allworshipping. The elite few among them know this and the rest don’t. The termAncient of Days (the ‘Old Race’ or Archons) is used for ‘God’ in a number oflanguages and religions, including Judaism: ‘One like a son of man approachesthe Ancient of Days and is invested with worldwide dominion; moreover, hiseverlasting reign over all kings and kingdoms is shared with ‘the people of theMost High’ (Book of Daniel 7:27). The Demiurge sub-contracts the world to thosewho serve his interests to run it as he demands and this dominion is shared withthe Archon-Reptilians. Buddhism’s creator god Brahma (Saturn) is known as theAncient of Days and so is Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith.[../Images/00521.jpg]Figure 237: Chronos or Kronos with beard and scythe and symbol of time.[../Images/00459.jpg]Figure 238: Chronos is what we call Old Father Time.> [../Images/00387.jpg]> Figure 239: The many guises of Chronos – Santa Claus; ‘God’ as a white-bearded> man on a cloud; the classic ‘Charlton Heston’-type version of God; and the> Architect in The Matrix.[../Images/00523.jpg]Figure 240: William Blake’s The Ancient of Days. © The Whitworth Gallery[../Images/00517.jpg]Figure 241: Chronos on the GE building in the Rockefeller Center, New York.[../Images/00485.jpg]Figure 242: The Freemasonic Great Architect of the Universe.Sigil of Saturn and the magic squareThe Freemasonic compasses are actually the ancient Seal or Sigil of Saturn, alsoknown as the Seal of Solomon (Saturn). Every syllable of Sol-om-on means thesun, but this refers to the Saturn sun, not the one we see today. The Sigil ofSaturn has two pyramids at the centre and six points and it is obvious where theinspiration came from for the classic symbol of Freemasonry (Fig 243). Thesquare also represents Saturn which is why Freemasons are said to be ‘on thesquare’ and you have the temple floor of black and white squares. You also seeblack and white squares on the floors of major cathedrals because Christianityis controlled by the same Archontic force as secret societies. In fact, most ofthe cathedrals were built according to geometrical and symbolic blueprintsprovided by secret societies like the Knights Templar. Many key buildings of theArchontic networks are located in squares and most American cities are designedin blocks or squares. All this comes from the Magic Square of Saturn (alsosignificantly the Magic Square of Freemasonry) in which the three numbers ineach line in all directions add up to 15 (Fig 244). Numbers are added togetherin numerology until they equal a single digit number between 1 and 9. So 15 inthe Saturn Square is 6 and three lines of 15 are 666. The total of all thenumbers equals 45 which in numerology is 9. Numbers are digital expressions ofenergetic states (information fields and frequencies). The Saturn Squarecontrols all numbers (energetic states) because in numerology every numberbreaks down eventually to between 1 and 9. The nought is pretty much irrelevantbecause 10 = 1; 20 = 2; 300 = 3; 4,000 = 4; 500,000 = 5; 6,000,000 = 6; and soon. Pick any random number, say 450,685,457. It seems to be a massive number,but not in numerology. All the numbers add up to 44 and 4 + 4 = 8. The numbers 1to 9 in the Saturn Magic Square are encoded in all numbers no matter how big orsmall. Control 1 to 9 and you control all numbers and numbers are digitalexpressions of vibrational (information) states. The numbers or energeticconstruct of the Matrix are represented by 1 to 9. The Seal or Sigil of Saturncomes from drawing lines between the numbers in the Saturn magic Square in theorder from 1 to 9 (Fig 245). The seal in turn becomes the six-pointed star andit means that these symbols are encoded with the numbers of Saturn. They puttheir numbers and symbols everywhere because they impact both upon the Earth’senergy field and human subconscious. By the way, just as the numbers 1 to 9 areencoded in all numbers so a word that is the ancient origin of newer words(entomology) is still encoded energetically in the newer words. The language ofwords, as with numbers, is the language of frequency, vibration and informationfields. The scythe or sickle is an ancient symbol of Saturn and this relates toits association with agriculture among other things. The Sumerians depictedtheir Saturn god with a sickle or scythe as did the ancient Greeks withChronos/Satan and we have Old Father Time (Chronos/Satan) holding a scythe.Chronos, according to Greek mythology, had a penchant for using his to part menfrom their balls. Maybe he just liked sopranos. The Egyptian god, Osiris, isalso portrayed holding a sickle and he was a symbol of Saturn under many othernames.

The scythe or sickletogether with the cross or hammer are used to symbolise Saturn because of itsastrological symbol, Capricorn. This symbol of Saturn appeared as the hammer andsickle in the emblem of the Soviet Union which I have shown in detail in otherbooks to have been created by the House of Rothschild, one of the most prominentArchontic families operating on their behalf within our reality (Figs 247 and248). The Jesuit Order is a major strand in the global web of Archontic secretsocieties. The Jesuits are headed by a Superior-General, also known as the Black(Saturn) Pope, while the new official Pope who took the name Francis is alongtime initiate of the Jesuit Order and connected by researchers and Catholicpriests to the fascist regime and its death squads in Argentina when he was theleading Jesuit official in the country under his real name Jorge Bergoglio. Heis clearly the perfect choice for such a fascist operation as the Roman Church.You can clearly see in the Jesuit logo the astrological symbol of Saturndepicted as the ‘h’ (Fig 249). The name ‘Rothschild’ comes from the redsix-point star, another major symbol of Saturn once displayed on their house inFrankfurt, as I said earlier. The Rothschild-Saturn star is on the flag ofIsrael and on the Great Seal of the United States – formed by the placing of 13stars within the circle (Fig 250). Thousands of years earlier the same symbolwas included in the Sumerian Tablets that featured the Anunnaki (Fig 251). TheArchontic takeover of Planet Earth has been unfolding for a very long ‘time’.The Great Seal of the United States and its reverse side with its pyramid andall-seeing eye are a mass of Archontic symbolism. There is another six-pointedstar encoded in the reverse side and the letters picked out are an anagram forMason (Fig 252). The eagle on the US seal is actually another Saturn symbol ofthe phoenix which was prominently featured in the closing ceremony of the LondonOlympics in 2012. The opening and closing ceremonies were awash with Archonticsymbolism and I will come to that and the phoenix later. You will often seelogos and symbols involving laurel branches as in the US Great Seal. This comesfrom the symbol of Saturn and its luminous crescent (Fig 253). The crescent wasoften symbolised as a goddess holding the god (Saturn) in her arms or wings, oras a bird with outstretched wings (Fig 254). The eagle (phoenix) and laurelbranches are used in the same way in the seals and logos of Archontic-controlledgovernments and other organisations. It can be seen in the US Great Seal, theRoman eagle (phoenix), the crest of the Archontic House of Windsor and in thelogo of the United Nations with the gun-sight targeting the Earth (Fig 255). TheUN is an Archon-created stalking horse for global control as I will beexplaining. The theme of the wings of Saturn led to the symbol of the ‘wingeddisc’ that can be found in Egypt and elsewhere in the ancient world (Fig 256).Thousands of years later we can see it employed by Archon-controlled secretsocieties and corporations (Fig 257). The Archontic-created-and-controlled‘entertainment’ industry, not least Hollywood, is in the frontline of perceptiondeception through words, sound and images. This is why it employsSatanic/Saturnic symbolism on an astonishing scale in music, television, movies,videos and stage performances. The performance by Madonna at the Super Bowl in2012 was ablaze with Saturn symbolism and included the winged disc more thanonce – on this occasion in conjunction with the spider (Fig 258). Saturn’snumber in numerology is 8 and this has led to its symbolism as a spider.[../Images/00519.jpg]Figure 246: The Grim Reaper is Chronos (Saturn) with his scythe.> [../Images/00267.jpg]> Figure 247 and 248: The astrological symbol of Saturn can be clearly seen in> the hammer and sickle of the Rothschild-created Soviet Union.> [../Images/00253.jpg]> Figure 249: The Jesuit logo.[../Images/00137.jpg]Figure 250: The Saturn/Rothschild symbolism on the Great Seal of the UnitedStates.[../Images/00494.jpg]Figure 251: Saturn in the Sumerian Tablets.[../Images/00053.jpg]Figure 252: The Great Seal was designed by Freemasons> [../Images/00291.jpg]> Figure 253: A reminder of Saturn and the luminous crescent which relate to> symbols in this sequence.> [../Images/00479.jpg]> Figure 254: Saturn and the crescent as a goddess and a bird.> [../Images/00506.jpg]> Figure 255: The theme continues with the Great Seal of the United States, the> Roman eagle, House of Windsor and the United Nations.[../Images/00553.jpg]Figure 256: The winged disc.[../Images/00492.jpg]Figure 257: The winged disk in many forms.[../Images/00564.jpg]Figure 258: The Saturn winged disk in spider mode during Madonna’s Super Bowlperformance.If you look at the black image at the bottom of that Madonna picture you willsee something that has the feel of a horned ram or goat. Saturn is symbolised asa goat or goat head because its astrological sign is Capricorn – the goat.Saturn symbolism is obvious in the composite representation of the evil forceknown as Baphomet (Fig 259). This was the deity apparently worshipped by theArchon-serving Knights Templar and continues to be so by today’s Satanists. Thegoat head is often depicted within a sixpointed star which gives a doubleSaturnic meaning and note the flame, a major Archontic symbol of those ‘madefrom smokeless fire’ or ‘luminous fire’ (Fig 260). Acclaimed Freemasonichistorian Manly P Hall confirmed that the goat god Pan was a symbol of Saturnfor the same reason (Figs 261). Hall wrote in his epic Secret Teachings of AllAges: ‘Pan was a composite creature, the upper part – with the exception of hishorns – being human, and the lower part in the form of a goat ... the godhimself is a symbol of Saturn because this planet is enthroned in Capricorn,whose emblem is a goat.’ Pan plays the pipes, the herd vibration for the humanmasses, as the god of shepherds and sheep – perfect symbolism for the ‘pipes’ ofthe Matrix. His horns are also a Saturn symbol as I have already said – rememberthe horned Madonna at the Super Bowl – and this is the origin of the image of ahorned Devil or Satan (Fig 262). Confirmation of this comes in Figure 263 withthe horned circle and dot image (all classic Saturn) on the robe of EugenGrosche (also Gregor A Gregorius), one of the founders in 1928 of theGerman-based Satanic Brotherhood of Saturn (Fraternitas Saturni). You can alsosee the logo of the hammer and sickle/cross. It has been widely observed amongresearchers how leading political figures often make the ‘horned-god’ hand signwith two fingers pointing upwards and the rest pointing down (Fig 264). Now youcan see why – it is a symbol for the Demiurge/Saturn. This is sometimes confusedwith a hand sign for the deaf meaning love. The horned god sign means anythingbut that and the ‘love’ sign has the thumb pointing outwards, not grasping thefingers. Saturn’s innermost moon is called Pan and orbits an area of the ringsknown as the Encke Gap. Pan is the origin of the term pandemonium, orPandæmonium in Paradise Lost by John Milton (1608-1674). Pandæmonium, orPan-demon, was the name given by Milton to ‘the high capital of Satan and allhis peers’. It became a term for a place of uproar, noise and confusion. Pan isalso a satanic god of sexuality, fertility, lust, rape and paedophilia andanother version of the Demiurge/Saturn. Paedophilia is massively part of theArchontic manipulation and I will detail why in due course. Saturn is associatedwith the forces of low-vibrational sexual energy. Pan is symbolised as thecontrolling spirit of the lower worlds – lower chakras – and so is Saturn. He isportrayed as drunk with an erect penis (but then my town is like that everyweekend). We also see Pan in J M Barrie’s Peter Pan – a very different characteroriginally to the one portrayed today. Barrie’s Peter Pan was bloodthirsty,cruel and a kidnapper and killer of children. I highlighted earlier how the cubeis a Saturn symbol and this is why the Muslim focus of worship is the black cubeknown as the Kaaba (‘Cube’) in Mecca. The cube can also be seen in many otherlocations and situations including the black cube standing on a square calledthe Tefillin that Jews wear on their head or forehead for a particular ritual(Fig 265). This is no surprise given that Islam and Judaism are worshipping thesame deity – the Demiurge/Saturn. There is a cube located outside theheadquarters of Brown-Brothers Harriman – a major Archon front and the oldest USprivate bank – across the street from Zuccotti Park, formerly Liberty PlazaPark, the scene of the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York (Fig 266). Thereare many other examples of giant cubes on display (Fig 267). You see the cube,again with the black cube predominant, symbolising Saturn in sci-fi and ‘alien’movies in which the real story is in the symbolism not the script. Thecomputer-robot-like Borg in Star Trek, with the emphasis on one eye, travelledin cubes (Fig 268). The Borg were portrayed as a race of cyborgs (partbiological, part artificial) which is what the Archontic agenda known astranshumanism is trying to achieve with humans as a major part of theassimilation into the Archon hive mind. The storyline of the Borg is that they‘take other species by force into the collective and connect them to “the hivemind” – the act is called assimilation and entails violence, abductions, andinjections of cybernetic implants’. Heard that somewhere before since you openedthis book? The Borg catchphrase is ‘resistance is futile’. There was also anepisode of the highly symbolic modern version of Dr Who, The Power of Three, inwhich billions of small black cubes appear around the world and later prove tobe part of a ‘slow invasion’ (Fig 269). The biblical Book of Revelationdescribes the New Jerusalem (code for the world under total Archon control) interms of a cube structure: ‘And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is aslarge as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousandfurlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal’ (Fig 270).[../Images/00536.jpg]Figure 259: Saturn as the satanic Baphomet, the astrological goat symbol ofCapricorn and much else.[../Images/00078.jpg]Figure 260: Baphomet portrayed as the six-pointed star of Saturn.[../Images/00001.jpg]Figure 261: Saturn as the goat god Pan.[../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 262: Baphomet everywhere – Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Madonna and BaronessPhilippine de Rothschild.[../Images/00125.jpg]Figure 263: Eugen Grosche, a founder of the Satanic Brotherhood of Saturn,adorned with Saturn symbols.[../Images/00166.jpg]Figure 264: The ‘horned-god’ hand sign beloved of so many among the rich andfamous.[../Images/00369.jpg]Figure 265: The Jewish Tefillin.[../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 266: The giant cube outside the Brown-Brothers Harriman building in NewYork.[../Images/00442.jpg]Figure 267: The cube symbol of Saturn.[../Images/00104.jpg]Figure 268: The Borg cubes.[../Images/00388.jpg]Figure 269: The Dr Who cube invasion.[../Images/00510.jpg]Figure 270: The New [cube] Jerusalem.Astrological SaturnThe colours used in Saturn/Satan worship are black and red with some gold thrownin. Black is the dominant one because it absorbs all colours and does notreflect them. Black is therefore the absence of light in Satanic ritual. Red isused by Satanists because it is the slowest/lowest wavelength in the colourspectrum. Everything comes down to wavelength, frequency and energetic effect.Black is associated with death and mourning and formal occasions. Astrologically(that is energetically) Saturn is the planet (sun) of death, restriction,authority, control, obedience, poverty, fear and time. This is why thesix-pointed star of Saturn is so often used to indicate authority (Fig 271).Saturn’s skull symbolism comes from its association with death and the fact thatastrologically it rules the skeletal structure and the skull. This is thebackground to the name of the Skull and Bones Society in the United States, alsoappropriately known as the Order of Death. It is a Saturn worshipping cult thatrecruits carefully chosen students from Yale University and brings them throughto serve the Archontic conspiracy as adults. Father and Boy George Bush areSkull and Bones initiates. I refer to politicians and government administratorsas ‘dark suits’ because the attire of most them is their Saturnesque blacksuits. The Kaaba cube at Mecca is black because it symbolises Saturn and for thesame reason you have the black robes of judges, barristers, priests and rabbis.Students also wear black robes when they are awarded their degree (ofprogramming) and graduate in their black mortarboard or square hat. Judges inblack robes have a hammer (Saturn/Thor) to bang down and impose their will in acourt (Fig 272). All this fits with the astrological connections made to Saturn.For example, Saturn astrologically (again, energetically) rules institutions,corporations, figures in authority, scientists and old people; it representslaws, rules, regulations and ‘tradition’ (repeating ritual); and it is the godof banking, one of most effective Archontic means, along with taxation, ofparasitizing the creative energy of the human population. We produce – theysteal. I have just described human society in that list of Saturn’s astrologicalinfluences. I can equally describe the manipulation of so much human emotionwith the term ‘Saturnine’ which means to have a gloomy, taciturn temperament andhas been related since ancient times to the influence of Saturn. Otherastrological characteristics include Saturn being non-emotive and cold (justlike the Demiurge-Archons) and representing limitation, austerity, disciplineand depression. The traits attributed to Saturn are those that manifest throughthe reptilian brain with an obsession with laws, rules, regulations and therepeating ritual disguised as ‘tradition’. The Saturnian and Draconian aredifferent words meaning the same thing. Talk about in your face once youpuncture the veil behind which all this is hidden. Every major facet of theArchontic Control System is connected to Saturn: religion (Saturn-worship);banking (astrologically ruled by Saturn); politics and the intuitions of Stateat all levels (astrologically ruled by Saturn); corporations (astrologicallyruled by Saturn); the law and the court system (astrologically ruled by Saturn);science (astrologically ruled by Saturn). Add to this all the annual festivalsinspired by Saturn and Moon worship and the endless Saturn symbolism in thelogos and advertising of Archontic-controlled corporations (Fig 273).[../Images/00434.jpg]Figure 271: Saturn = authority.[../Images/00491.jpg]Figure 272: Human society is awash with Saturn symbolism.X marks the plotThere is a further frontline symbol that I want to highlight and that is the X,or cross. The ‘Christian’ cross has been used since antiquity as a symbol ofSaturn and this is why Satanists use it in their rituals. The inverted cross isespecially powerful in tapping into the most negative energies of the Dark Sun.Jesus nailed to the cross symbolises a sacrifice to Saturn/Satan and the Celticor Druidic cross is the cross of Saturn and the ring of Saturn (Fig 274). We seethe cross symbol used in the form of a ‘Christian’ cross and as an X in so manynames, titles and situations that have connections to the bloodline network. Toname only a few ... X-Men, X-Files, X-box, Planet X, X-ray, Camp X-ray,X-Factor, and Generation-X. The X-Men are a mutant race in the Marvel Comicseries and have featured in major movies. Marvel Comic characters in generalhave appeared in a long list of films and continue to do so. The X-Men have whatis called the ‘X-gene’ and have different DNA to their parents. The X-gene cangive them ‘super powers’ and causes them to have blue skin, wings or tails. TheX-chromosome is highly-significant to the bloodlines because their geneticprogram is passed on through the female in the form of mitochondrial DNA. TheX-chromosome dictates sexual type. Boys have one X-chromosome and oneY-chromosome while girls have two X-chromosomes. The bloodlines certainlybelieve that their mitochondrial DNA has the X-factor that humanity doesn’tshare. The eugenicist Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), grandfather ofeugenicists Julian and Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World), establishedthe X Club for his circle of eugenicists and supporters of Darwin’s theory (itwas only a theory) of evolution. Scientist Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958)developed a method to X-ray DNA and it appeared as an X pattern. This led to therealisation that DNA was a double-helix. The optic chiasm in the brain alsoforms an X where the optic nerves cross. The term chiasm comes from Greek wordsmeaning ‘crossing’ and ‘to mark with an X’. Planet X is alleged to be a planetheading our way to cause death and destruction. The Planet X story relates tothe ‘planet Nibiru’ which appears in the translations of the Sumerian Tablets byZecharia Sitchin. This is said to be the planet of the Anunnaki and many peoplepredict the imminent return of Nibiru on its alleged 3,600 year ellipticalorbit. I don’t buy that myself. Sitchin translates Niburu as the ‘Planet of theCrossing’, but how about this simply being code for the planet (sun) of thecross – Saturn? Sitchin would certainly have known the relationship between thecross and Saturn given that he was a Zionist, a creed that is founded on theworship of Saturn. This would make Saturn the planet/sun of the Anunnaki. CampX-Ray is the concentration camp and torture centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,where alleged terrorists (mostly on the basis of no evidence whatsoever) areheld indefinitely by the same US government and military complex which lecturesthe world about freedom and justice. X-rays are a form of electromagneticradiation known as X-radiation (the Archons love radiation). Generation X (or‘Gen-X’) is the term coined to describe those born after the post-war baby boomera between 1960 and the early 1980s. This would make them anything from early30s to early 50s.[../Images/00187.jpg]Figure 273: Saturn corporate logos[../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 274: The Celtic cross.[../Images/00273.jpg]Figure 275: The X in X Factor passes through the rings of Saturn[../Images/00537.jpg]Figure 276: It goes past the Moon to brand the Earth.Generation X have been a particular target for the conspiracy because they arethe adults in their prime today that the bloodlines have to subvert in terms ofaction and perception before the most targeted generation in known human history(today’s young children, teens and twenties) replace them in the planned BraveNew World, or global slave state. The ‘talent show’ X-Factor has been astandard-bearer for the perception-enslaving and diverting crap that passes forentertainment. Simon Cowell has made his fortune producing the Consciousnessequivalent of a Big Mac. Opening titles for X-Factor have featured an X passingthrough Saturn’s rings at great speed on its way to ‘branding’ the Earth andalso passing the Moon to do the same (Figs 275 and 276). The show’s set displaysthree prominent X’s and, numerologically, X equals 6. This therefore representsthe Saturn magic square numbers of 666 which is dubbed the ‘Mark of the Beast’in the Bible. A ‘hex’ is a malevolent magic spell or curse and a prefix to theGreek word for six, as in hexagon. A hexagon is the centre of a hexagram (ahexagon with six triangles added) which is a symbol of Saturn. The black magicGoddess of the Dark Moon known as Hecate (an aspect of the ancient GoddessDiana) is the goddess of the crossroads and Princess Diana was murdered at Pontde l’Alma (meaning ‘bridge or passage of the moon goddess’) where many roadscross.[../Images/00351.jpg]Figure 277: .The crossed-arm pose of the Egyptian Saturn god, Osiris.The Egyptian Saturn sun god, Osiris, is symbolised by the X in secret societiesand Satanists. Osiris is often depicted with his arms forming a cross (Fig 277).Freemasons do the same in some initiation rituals and those given a Masonicfuneral have their arms crossed on their chest, the same as Egyptian pharaohs.Freemasonry also uses the X as a symbol of Lucifer, the light bearer, and thisalso has sexual meanings. Saturn is very strongly related to sexual energy andthis is one reason why sex is such a major part of Satanism and satanic ritual.Pornographic films are called X-rated and the most extreme as XXX, or triple X.The Saturn sun god, Nimrod, was symbolised as an X and his birth was celebratedat the High Sabbath of Babylon which relates to our Christmas – or X-mas as itis known in its shorter form. The Saturn X is depicted by the cross in thesymbol of the bloodline Skull and Bones Society and in the Crossed Keys of Peterin the coat of arms of the Papacy (Fig 278). The X or cross is also in theswastika. A common way of pledging truthfulness is to say ‘cross my heart andhope to die’. If someone has been deceived or betrayed they say they have beendouble-crossed. You see the double-cross in the crest of the seriously bloodlineHouse of Lorraine in France and in the logo of Exxon, the Rockefeller oilcompany (Figs 279 and 280). X represents the unknown and hidden and this can beseen in the ‘X equals’ theme in algebra. We use the term ‘X-factor’ to mean thatthere is something still unknown. Saturn represents the hidden and unknown andis associated with the underworld. One of its names is the ‘god of the hiddencouncils’. I see the word stop or block whenever I think of X. We place a tickto mean yes or correct, and an X to mean no or incorrect. It is appropriate tohave an X in Matrix (trix/tricks) – the blocker and distorter of humanperception.[../Images/00259.jpg]Figure 278: Double-crossed – the skull and bones and Vatican symbol.[../Images/00344.jpg]Figure 279: Double-cross of the House of Lorraine.[../Images/00463.jpg]Figure 280: Double-cross of Rockefeller Exxon.Saturn GroveI have written at length over the years about a place called Bohemian Grove inSonoma County, about 75 miles north of San Francisco. The self-styled ‘Elite’assemble here every year for a ‘summer camp’ in 2,700 acres of redwood forestwhere they perform their rituals to Saturn/Satan – the Demiurge. Most of themake-up-the-numbers ‘grovers’ won’t know this, but the major players do. Theseinclude the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and a Who’s Who ofthe rich and famous that I have named in other books who are from a particularhybrid bloodline that serves the Archontic agenda (Fig 281). The focal point ofthese rituals is a 40-foot stone owl symbolic of the ancient satanic ‘god’,Moloch/Molech (Fig 282). The ancients sacrificed children in fire to Moloch andthis theme is recorded in the Bible – ‘And thou shalt not let any of thy seedpass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God...’ (Leviticus:18:21). This is also the origin of the Wicker Man in Celticritual in which children were sacrificed through immolation.Moloch/Molech (which means ‘King’) is symbolised as an owl, but also as acrocodile and a ‘bullheaded colossus’. Moloch is the Prince of Hell indemonology who gets special pleasure from making mothers weep by stealing theirchildren – which is what the state is doing, in ever greater numbers, withludicrous and outrageous excuses being made to seize children from their lovingparents (see Human Race Get Off Your Knees). Moloch was considered a god of theSaturn sun by the Canaanites/Ammonites and was referred to as Baal (‘Lord’)Moloch (Fig 283). Other names for the Saturn pentagram or six-pointed star arethe Star of Moloch and the Star of Remphan. The latter was the Egyptian name forSaturn. The biblical ‘Lord’ is Saturn and when they talk about churches beingthe ‘House of the Lord’ they are correct – just not the one the congregationthink they are worshipping. They are the houses of Saturn/Satan. HelenaBlavatsky, or ‘Madame Blavatsky’ (1831-1891), was a writer from a Russian royal(Archontic) bloodline who wrote a number of books about occult symbolism andco-founded the Theosophical Society in New York for the ‘study and elucidationof Occultism, the Cabala etc.’ She wrote in her book, Isis Unveiled: ‘Now wehave to remember that Siva and the Palestinian Baal, or Moloch, and Saturn areidentical.’ I found the Saturn owl ‘god’ somewhere else, too – in the roadlayout around Capitol Hill in Washington DC (Fig 284). The centre of the UnitedStates political system is in the belly of Saturn and standing on the top of apyramid. Here you have the owl symbol of Saturn (it sees in the dark and canturn its head enough to have 360 degree vision) not only with Congress in itsbelly, but on top of the pyramid from where the all-seeing eye looks out inArchontic secret society symbolism. But then what is the owl? Saturn. What isthe eye? Saturn. The symbolism of Moloch as a bull relates to the Saturn as the‘horned god’ and is the origin of the biblical narrative about the worship ofthe golden calf to which the Canaanites are said to have sacrificed theirchildren (Fig 285). This is completely in sync with Moloch as a focus for childsacrifice. From Moloch symbolised as the horned bull we get the bull symbolassociated with Wall Street and the Archontic and parasitic banking system (Fig286). I came across an album cover for the band, Earth, Wind and Fire, whichvirtually had the full set – the illuminated pyramid and all-seeing eye, thesix-pointed star, the winged disc, the cross in different forms and the menorah,the Jewish seven-branched candelabrum (symbolising Saturn’s luminous crescentwhich when used in conjunction with candles or oil is said to symbolise theeternal flame or light – Saturn). To completely confirm the collective meaningthe cover includes an image of Saturn itself (Fig 287).[../Images/00230.jpg]Figure 281: Archon Bohemian Grove.[../Images/00487.jpg]Figure 282: The worship of Moloch/Molech.[../Images/00361.jpg]Figure 283: Moloch, the Saturn god..[../Images/00048.jpg]Figure 284: The Saturn pattern –the Moloch owl in the road system around CapitolHill.[../Images/00565.jpg]Figure 285: The Saturn sacrifice.[../Images/00182.jpg]Figure 286: Moloch and the bull market – Wall Street.[../Images/00193.jpg]Figure 287: The Saturn ‘set’.[../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 288: The Saturn-Moon Matrix – the human ‘real’ world.Saturn symbolism is everywhere and I have only given a few examples here to makethat point. There are so many others and I will introduce more as we go alone.The scale of the symbolism reflects how Saturn is such a crucial part of theArchontic Control System which includes royalty, politics, banking,corporations, media, military, Hollywood and the rest of the corporateentertainment industry, plus much else. Together they serve the interests of theDemiurge-Archons and their Matrix which holds most of humanity fast in the fakereality of the perception deception (Fig 288). We talk about people being ‘inthe box’, but perhaps ‘in the cube’ would be more accurate. The Matrixdisconnects people from a conscious connection to their true self and infinitereality beyond its vibrational walls and so binds perception to the five sensesor, put another way, binds them to ignorance."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00143.jpg]Archon ‘Blood’Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.Oscar WildeThe ancients talked widely about another form of genetic manipulation by thepredator force to covertly infiltrate and direct human society. These werehuman-reptilian (human-Archon) bloodline hybrids infused with a far greaterpercentage of reptilian (Archon) genetics or, more accurately, informationsoftware.These hybrid bloodlines have different biological software programs runningthrough their DNA to those which enslave the human population. The hybridprograms cause them to worship the Archons (as they do in satanic ritual), andespecially their ‘god’, the Demiurge (‘Satan’, ‘Lucifer’, the ‘Devil’), and theyserve these masters by acting as middlemen and women to structure and manipulatehuman society in ways that advance the Demiurge agenda for complete control ofhuman perception and so human energy. They are programmed to constantly triggerthe human emotional programs running through non-coding DNA which produce theemotional energy on which the Archons feed – hence all the wars, fear,deprivation and suffering. They are also encoded with the foundation Archontrait of deception – which is why the hybrid bloodlines are, literally, geneticliars. I have one word to say here: politicians. Those of the Archon hybridbloodline can’t stop themselves lying even when they don’t need to for their ownbenefit. They are liars on demand – deceivers. Ain’t that right, Barack Obama,George Bush, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, David Cameron ad infinitum? The Demiurgeand Archons cannot stay in our reality for long for reasons of frequency andatmosphere and they have overcome this handicap by working through their hybridbiological computers which are compatible with the frequency and atmosphere ofour ‘world’. The Archon human hybrids also have greater genetic compatibilityand so frequency compatibility because of the duel genetics (resonance). Thismeans that the Archon-Reptilians can possess the hybrids far more powerfully andcompletely than the rest of the human population. The Archon possession of thehybrids is so complete that while people apparently see human royalty,politicians, bankers, corporate leaders and so on, they are actually looking atArchons in human form and they work globally as one unit even though they appearon the surface to be representing different countries and institutions (Fig289). These bloodlines see themselves as the ‘Elite’ because of their geneticconnection to the Archontic ‘gods’ and the term comes from the Hebrew god ofSaturn called ‘El’ (‘Mighty One’). Collectively this plays out as the ‘El-ohim’(mentioned 2,500 times in the Old Testament) which is another name for theArchons. EL is also on public display in the name Is-Ra-El (Isis-Ra-El). Ra isan Egyptian god of the Saturn sun; El is the Hebrew Saturn god and Isis, theEgyptian goddess, symbolises Saturn’s luminous crescent enfolding the ‘god’ asmany goddess deities do. We see El in a religious context in the names ang-ELand the ‘archang-ELs’ called Micha-EL, Gabri-EL, Uri-EL and Rapha-EL. TheArchons are often referred to as the Fallen Ang-ELs. Another name for Jesus isEmmanu-EL. The New Testament tells the stories of Jesus/Emmanu-El in bookscalled Gosp-ELs and their communication is overseen by church El-ders who helpto cast the Sp-EL-l on the minds of people in a chap-EL and temple(El). We alsohave evangElists and when you progress in up the religious hierarchy you aresaid to be Elevated to the priesthood. In the political context we haveEl-lections where pawns are El-ected to serve the El-lite in their citad-ELs. Ialso say that the Matrix operates within El-ectromagnetism, a domain of El. Soit is absolutely correct that the world has gone to El. The El-lite are alsocru-El and talk absolute driv-EL. The Saturn connection to royalty can also beseen with the word ‘crown’ which derives from Chronos, the Saturn god of ancientGreece and you see the Archons in hierarchy and in arch-angel, arch-bishop andarchitect (Fig 290).[../Images/00234.jpg]Figure 289: Archon hybrids.[../Images/00209.jpg]Figure 290: Archons in their many guises.So many visitors ...The Demiurge-Archon manipulation of Earth society has been going on for at leasthundreds of thousands of years. The Gnostic texts say it has been happeningsince ‘the beginning’ when the ‘bad copy’ or Matrix was created. The scale ofcontrol, however, was not always as it is now. This is relatively recentcompared with the period that they have had their ‘eyes’ on the place. SumerianTablets tell of a line of kings of Anunnaki origin going back 240,000 years, butthey were not all kings located in the land of Mesopotamia, or ‘Sumer’. Theywere a line of kings representing Demiurge-Archon interests going back to theperiod of Mu/Lemuria and perhaps earlier in the way we measure ‘time’. Many andvarious non-human groups and races have come to the Earth and interacted withthe people. Outer form is only limited by the nature of the information encodedat the waveform level and so the potential for ‘physical’ forms that looknothing like humans is infinite. Observe the many very different human races andthe fantastic range of different species in the animal, bird and insect worldsand this is only on one planet and within the tiny frequency range of visiblelight. Those ‘journalists’ and members of the public who laugh about ‘littlegreen men’ and dismiss any idea that other forms of intelligence with two legsand two arms can exist are professional idiots. Many non-human orextraterrestrial/interdimensional races have added their genetics to the humanform and this is why various human races can look so different. Are we reallysaying that black Africans, Chinese and Caucasian ‘whites’ came from exactly thesame genetic source?? It is another elephant on the sofa. These otherextraterrestrial/interdimensional groups have spanned the range fromnothing-like-human to very-like-human. I have talked with insiders who havedescribed meeting ‘ETs’ that were so like humans that they had to look veryclosely to see the difference. One of these near-human-looking races is known bythe UFO research community as the ‘Nordics’ because of their blond hair and blueeyes. African legend talks about these same ‘gods’ and calls them the ‘Mzungu’.Credo Mutwa told me that when the white Europeans first arrived in South Africathe people thought they were the returning Mzungu (Fig 291). They could possiblybe the origin of the white race, which I suggest has been living on Earth for arelatively short time compared with some of the others, and the Reptilian‘royalty’ known as the Draco are also white, or albino-skinned, according toancient and modern descriptions. After the engineered cataclysms – I repeatthere have been many – the whole story took on a new phase. The Archons gainedfar more influence through their hybrids as they infiltrated the Mystery Schoolsin Egypt, Mesopotamia, and throughout the ancient world. This was helped by thefact that the Archons had infiltrated Atlantean society to a large extentthrough covert deception and mind possession before the cataclysms that broughtan end to the continent.[../Images/00103.jpg]Figure 290: Credo Mutwa’s portrayal of the Mzungu.No empathy, no compassionThe hybrid software programs that I will call the Archon bloodlines have aparticular encoding which is crucial to understanding why the world is at it isand why those in power act as they do. Their DNA and genetic make- up (software)cannot decode and express empathy because they are hybrid mirrors of the Archonmentality. Empathy is the fail-safe mechanism of human behaviour, or anybehaviour. Empathy is defined as: ‘The power of understanding and imaginativelyentering into another person’s feelings.’ This ability to empathise with howyour actions will make others feel is essential to balanced behaviour. Withoutempathy, anything goes. This means that the bloodline hybrids can cause massdeath, destruction and suffering without any emotional consequence whatsoever.Genetically this is the origin of what we call psychopaths, which express theArchons and their bloodlines so perfectly. I see people dismiss the blatantevidence that this bloodline Cabal were the real perpetrators of 9/11 to providethe excuse to impose their Orwellian state and ‘war on terror’ (war onhumanity). ‘They wouldn’t do that’, comes the cry. I see people dismiss theblatant evidence that the two world wars were coldly engineered to transformglobal society and centralise power in ways that I have described at length inmy books. ‘They wouldn’t do that’, comes the cry once again. There are manypsychological aspects to this instant dismissal (not least from ‘journalists’).People don’t want it to be true for a start, because it means they would have totake whole new look at themselves, their beliefs and the world in general. Youcan either face – and deal with – what you would rather not be true, or, as withmost people, you can simply deny that it’s true. Denial – self-deceit – is oneof the most profound of human prison cells. How can you do anything aboutanything that you deny is happening? Another reason that people dismiss theglobal conspiracy is that they cannot conceive that a sick and demented Cabalwould set out to kill millions in the Middle East through mass bombing,sanctions that killed half a million children in Iraq alone in the 1990s (UnitedNations figures) and through countless other overt and covert means. Theinvasion of Iraq had by 2007, according to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), madethe country one of the worse places for children to live in the Middle East andNorth Africa with around 3.5 million living in poverty, 1.5 million under theage of five undernourished and 100 infants dying every day. People make themistake of perceiving what the bloodline Cabal would do on the basis of whatthey themselves would do. But they are not comparing like with like. The hybridbloodlines have been genetically-engineered to slaughter and cause mayhemwithout mercy – and mercy comes from empathy. The Archons are hardly going togenetically-engineer hybrid representatives to advance their agenda of evil andthen give them a sense of empathy and mercy that would stop them imposing thenightmare that the agenda demands. The Archon contribution to the hybridgenetics is heartlessness and cold-bloodedness and the human side has beengenetically-engineered to reflect those traits. Look at that term – heart-less.They transformed our reality from a heart-centred society to a belly-gut societybecause the belly-gut is their home ground and the heart is a place they cannotgo. Or don’t want to. The distortion from which the Archons are made manifestcannot feel empathy, compassion and genuine heart responses to the experiencesof others and so they have to try to replicate them through acting. Look at theQueen and the British royal family in general, Obama, Blair, the Clintons, theBushes and so on. They have no genuine emotional responses and so they act themand put on a face to deceive their audience; but, to anyone with a smear ofperception, they do it so badly. They are purveyors of fake emotion for theyhave none of their own except fear and hatred. The Archons have herded humanityinto their vibrational ‘stadium’ – their Matrix Hack – where they know how towin the game because they made the rules. The Trainman character in one of theMatrix movies said of the closed-loop world that he created: ‘You don’t get it.I built this place. Down here, I make the rules. Down here, I make the threats.Down here, I’m God.’ Yes, ‘down here’ in low-vibrational terms. You mightremember that the Trainman also pulled up his sleeve to reveal an arm full ofwatches – the illusion of time is one of the key pillars of the Matrix. TheArchons take multiple forms, but a dominant one is reptilian and it is nocoincidence that Swiss clairvoyant, Anton Styger, describes how he sees ‘system’people possessed by reptilian entities:> When I see people in business or politics who are particularly trapped by the> material world, for example, I notice that they no longer have any light> bodies at all. In many of these people, the point of light at the heart> chakra, which is otherwise always present, is no longer visible to me.> Instead, I see something like a layer of ‘shiny tar’ around them in which a> monstrous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished. When such> people speak on television, for example, I see a crocodile shape manifesting> itself around the person like in a concave mirror; I don’t see the light of> their throat and forehead chakra.The human-Archon hybrids are designed to be vehicles for Archon-Reptilianpossession and this possession blocks a connection with anything but the Archonfrequency band. They serve the Demiurge-Archon plan by appearing to be humanwhile actually providing the vehicle for a force that is anything but human. Agood analogy for this dynamic is of a scientist in a laboratory who cannot workdirectly with material because it is too dangerous. So the material (humanity)is placed in a sealed tank (our frequency band) and the scientists (Archons)stand outside the tank and put their hands and arms in long gloves (the hybridbloodlines) to manipulate events inside the tank (Fig 292). The hybridbloodlines are the means through which a non-human force has infiltrated humansociety while keeping secret the true identity of the entities directing andmanipulating events. They are like a genetic version of the Trojan horse. We areback to the Avatar movie again and the theme of the American military (withtheir classic Archon mentality) infiltrating the blue people’s society by hidingbehind outer forms that looked like them. Once more we see the fundamentalArchon trait of deception. The human-Archon hybrid vehicles are the origin ofthe belief in the ‘Divine right to rule’ because of their bloodline and thisstill officially applies to the head of state in many countries today. This isespecially true in Britain and 16 countries of the Commonwealth where QueenElizabeth II sits atop the genetic Figure 292: The relationship between thehierarchy of power. Hierarchical structures and repeating ritual are a majorexpression of reptilian genetics and the reptilian brain and so the hybridbloodlines are obsessed with it. We can see this in royal protocol (ritual) andthe strict divisions of royalty and aristocracy in the form of King/Queen;Prince/Princess; Duke/Duchess; Marquis/Marchioness; Earl/Countess;Viscount/Viscountess; Baron/Baroness. Even most of the sycophants who arse-lickand fawn over these people don’t have a clue who they really are and who theyreally represent. The truth is firewalled behind fierce compartmentalisation ofknowledge at the very highest levels of the satanic and secret societyhierarchies and to hide the fact that official royalty and their hybrid brothersand sisters (the ‘Dark Suits’) that control the world’s governments, military,religions, banking, corporations and cartels of oil (Big Oil), pharmaceuticals(Big Pharma), biotech (Big Biotech), armaments (Big War), media (Big Media) andfood (Big Food), are human-Archon/Reptilian hybrid bloodlines embarked on a nowwell-advanced plan for global domination (Fig 293).[../Images/00538.jpg]Figure 292: The relationship between the Archons and their hybrids within humanreality.[../Images/00409.jpg]Figure 293: The relationship between the Archons and their hybrids within humanreality.Archon ‘royalty’The bloodlines were implanted all over the world and so almost everywhere yousee the symbolic and literal connection between the reptilian and royalty. Thehybrid bloodlines and their hidden masters were symbolised by royal emblems suchas a dragon, a snake, a plumed serpent and the tree-cross, or Ankh. Often thegenetic lines of royalty and the ‘priestly classes’ had the same origin and thiswhy you will see many Archon ‘royal’ bloodlines described as ‘priest-kings’ –the Merovingian line in what we now call France is a prime example. TheMerovingians ruled for 300 years from the middle of the 5th century and are saidto be ancestors of the remaining official royal families of Europe and many whooperate covertly today in the world of the Dark Suits. These have included manyUS presidents. The Merovingians came to modern public attention in the books,The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and The Da Vinci Code, which claimed that theMerovingians were the secret bloodline of Jesus as a result of Mary Magdalene,his alleged wife, taking their offspring to France after the crucifixion. I moststrongly suggest that anyone looking dispassionately at the evidence (or lack ofit) will soon realise that there was no ‘Jesus’ and so there was no crucifixionand there were no offspring. Or ‘Mary Magdalene’ come to that. But there was andis a great secret that involves the Merovingian bloodline and its modernoffshoots which relates to its Archon hybrid origins, not Jesus. Archon Royaltyand the aristocracy are widely known as ‘bluebloods’ and Stewart Swerdlow, asurvivor of the US government-military mind control project at Montauk on LongIsland, New York, says that the term blueblood comes from the increased amountof copper in their blood. He says that this makes the blood turn a blue-greencolour in a process called oxidation. Chinese emperors claimed the right to ruleby their descendence from the ‘serpent gods’, and many emperors were describedin reptilian terms; as in having a ‘dragon-like countenance’. One of them, HuangTi, was said to have been conceived by a ray of golden light that entered hismother’s womb from the Big Dipper constellation. This is the virgin-birth storythat we see all over the world. Among them is the story of QueenSemiramis/Ishtar, the goddess or queen of Babylon, who was said to have beenimpregnated by the rays of the sun god, Baal (Nimrod). But these deitiesrepresent the Saturn sun, not the one we see today. The Big Dipper includesAlpha Draconis, the star of the Egyptian god, Set, and many stories about theReptilians say that Alpha Draconis is home to the Reptilian ‘royalty’, a wingedalbino race known as the ‘Draco’, as in draconian – a word that encapsulates theworld that they want to impose on humanity. Emperors of the Archon-Reptilianbloodline succession in China were known as ‘Dragons’ and this, of course, isthe dominant symbol to this day in China and the Far East. James Churchward, oneof the best-known researchers of the lost continent of Mu/Lemuria, said that theNagas, the reptilian bloodline hybrids in India, also populated China, Tibet andAsia. David Frawley, founder and director of the American Institute for VedicStudies in Santa Fe, New Mexico, has described how the Vedas, the ancient Hinduholy books, connect the earliest priest-king bloodlines of India to the‘Bhrigus’, an order of adepts initiated into the ancient knowledge, who arrivedfrom across the sea (Mu/Lemuria). Frawley writes in, Gods, Sages, And Kings:Vedic Secrets Of Ancient Civilization, that the monarchs of these Bhrigusbloodlines included the ‘Serpent King’ Nahusha. The Mahauyutpatti, a Buddhisttext, lists 80 kings who descended from the Nagas or ‘Serpent Kings’. Rulersthroughout India claimed the right to have power over the population becausethey descended from the Nagas, the offspring from human interbreeding with theArchon serpent ‘gods’, as they were perceived. Accounts in the Indian epics alsorefer to how the reptilian Nagas intermingled with white peoples and from thiscame a hybrid ‘royal’ line known as the Aryan kings.Egypt was another major centre for the Archon-Reptilian hybrids after theyinfiltrated the society of surviving Atlanteans who had relocated there.Infiltrated Egypt clearly symbolised their pharaohs in reptilian terms with thecobra on the forehead, cobra body protruding from the chin and the headdressrepresenting the hood of the cobra (Fig 294). The cobra has been a common symbolof the bloodlines for thousands of years. I have talked about the Jinn, theArabian name for the Archons, and the word is also spelt Djinn. Can it becoincidence that in Egypt Dj was a designation for serpent? There was anEgyptian order known as the Djedhi (the inspiration for the Jedi in Star Wars?)and there were pharaohs of the Archon-Reptilian line called Djer, Djoser andDjederfra. The oil still used in the British Coronation ritual is symbolic ofthe fat of the Nile crocodile called the ‘Messeh’ which was used in theCoronation ceremonies for pharaohs in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian ceremonialtitle ‘Moche’ means ‘He who is anointed with crocodile fat from the Nile River’.From Messeh we get ‘messiah’ – the Jewish and Christian legend of the coming‘saviour’. But messiah means the one anointed with the fat of the crocodile: thenew pharaoh. This theme can be found in Celtic mythology, too, and the image ofthe Messeh evolved to become a Dragon, the emblem of kingship. Anotherorganisation behind the hybrid bloodlines in Egypt was the Royal Court of theDragon, established in 2170 BC and more formally in 1783 BC. This would laterexpand into other regions and countries and include among its initiates, Vladthe Impaler, the 15th century ruler of Transylvania, the home of the vampirelegends in what is now in Romania. Vlad slaughtered tens of thousands of peopleand impaled many of them on stakes. The decaying corpses were often left formonths and Vlad delighted in dipping his bread in the blood of those he rituallykilled. He was the son of Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into the ancient Orderof the Dragon by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1431. The Order’s emblem was adragon, wings extended, hanging on a cross. This fits with descriptions of theso-called Reptilian royalty, the winged and white-skinned Draco. All members ofthe Order had a dragon on their coat of arms and they still do. Vlad Dracul’sson, Vlad the Impaler, signed his name Draculea or Draculya – the ‘Devil’s Son’.This was the origin of Bram Stoker’s stories about Dracula, a name thatapparently translates as something close to ‘Son of Him who had the Order of theDragon’. The blood-drinking and human sacrifice of the Dragon Order and today’sSatanism are a biological software program that runs through the DNA of thesefamilies and is passed from parents to children. This is why human sacrifice andblood drinking ritual has followed wherever the bloodlines have located and itstill goes on today on a massive scale as I will be revealing in a laterchapter. When you think that Queen Mary, or Mary of Teck, grandmother to thepresent Elizabeth II, was descended from the family of Vlad the Impaler, or‘Dracula’, it puts into even more perspective what I have been saying all theseyears about the Queen and the British royal family and their participation inhuman sacrifice rituals (Figs 295 and 296). Prince Charles confirmed his Vlad(Dracula) ancestry in 2011 while on a trip to his property in Transylvania (Fig297). He said that this bloodline connection gave him a ‘stake’ in protectingTransylvania’s forests and landscape. The Bush family is also related to Vladthe Impaler and this will be no surprise to those who have read some of my otherbooks and their exposure of Father George Bush. The kings of ancient Media inwhat is now Iran and part of Turkey were known as ‘Mar’ and this translates as‘snake’ in Persian. They were known as the ‘Dragon Dynasty of Media’, or‘descendants of the dragon’. The earliest royal lines of Central America claimeddescent from the serpent gods, and Credo Mutwa, who has closely studied thegenetics of black African ‘royalty’, says that these bloodlines were seeded bythe serpent gods that the Zulus call the Chitauri. He says that the samebloodlines were also the source of black African political leaders who followedillusory ‘independence’ from the colonial rule of the European powers. TheSumerian accounts tell of flying serpents and dragons and how the kings ofSumer, going back long before the deluge to some 240,000 BC, were ‘changelings’seeded by the union of the Anunnaki and humans. The Sumerian Tablets say thatthe whole idea of ‘kingship’ was introduced by the Anunnaki. The theme of‘special’ and ‘royal’ bloodlines representing the ‘gods’ on Earth is a universalone and, unfortunately, they are still with us.[../Images/00354.jpg]Figure 294: Archon pharaoh.[../Images/00389.jpg]Figure 295: Mary of Teck of the Vlad the Impaler bloodline.[../Images/00331.jpg]Figure 296: Mr and Mrs Archon.[../Images/00373.jpg]Figure 297: Charles and Vlad, the blood relatives.Journeys of the Archon peopleMontauk survivor Stewart Swerdlow says in his book Blue Blood, True Blood thatthe Sumerians became known as the Sum-Aryans, or simply Aryans, and theyexpanded into North Africa, Central Asia, Northern India and the Steppes ofRussia. He writes: ‘The Aryan leaders, all bluebloods, became the Sultans andRajas of legend.’ Swerdlow also points out something that I have beenhighlighting at length for a long time – the story of the Khazars. I am notgoing to repeat all the detail which is revealed at considerable length in bookslike Human Race Get Off Your Knees and Remember Who You Are; but the basicoutline is important because of the impact it has on the world today and forthose who have never come across the subject before. The human-reptilianblueblood hybrids were seeded all over the world and their manipulation of thehuman population has been passed down through the generations to present day.Many blueblood groups expanded their influence a long distance from theirorigins and the most significant of these in terms of the modern world came outof Sumer and Babylon in what is collectively known as Mesopotamia – the land ofthe Anunnaki – and other associated regions including Egypt. These peoples, ledby their blueblood ‘royalty’ leadership, took off in all directions. They becamethe founders of Rome and through the Roman Empire and other routes and namesthey expanded into eastern, western and northern Europe where they became theroyal families and aristocracy which survives to this day, either officiallythrough families like the Windsors in Britain or unofficially embedded in thecontrol networks of government, banking, big business, media and so on (Fig298). One of the central bloodlines is the House of Rothschild and they arrivedin Europe in this Mesopotamian exodus under different names, including Bauer,before they named themselves Rothschild in the 18th century after a Saturnsymbol. Stewart Swerdlow said that he learned at Montauk that these bloodlinesinterbred with the Celts who were ancestors from the survivors of Atlantis. TheArchon-Reptilians’ preferred genetic-type for interbreeding are blond-haired,blue-eyed people because, according to Swerdlow, the combination produces agenetic combination that is much easier to mind control.[../Images/00263.jpg]Figure 298: The Archon bloodlines of the Middle and Near East expanded intoEurope under many names.The Khazar hoaxAnyway, back to the Khazars. These were Sumerian/Babylonian people who settledin the Caucasus mountains region in what is now Georgia and southern Russia andthey went on to become the Jewish peoples of Eastern and later Western Europewho are now located overwhelmingly in the United States and Israel (Fig 299).They have no historical association with the land called Israel. The ‘Jewish’connection to these former peoples of Mesopotamia only came after 740AD when theKhazar ruler, King Bulan, oversaw a mass conversion by his people to Judaism. Itwould appear that he wanted to avoid being absorbed by the Christian or Islamicempires on either side. The Khazar king was known as the ‘Khagan’ or ‘Kagan’which is why this is such a common Jewish name to this day. The Khazars alsointerbred with people from the Far East after the invasion of their region bythe socalled ‘Golden Horde’. They moved northwards after the Khazar Empire endedand settled in Eastern Europe and then Western Europe before the coming to powerof the Nazis and by then they were known under the collective name of ‘Jews’.What followed in Nazi Germany caused most of them to head for Palestine and theUnited States. They are known today as Ashkenazi Jews which comprise theoverwhelming majority of the global Jewish population. The Ashkenazi have alsocontrolled the Israel government since the state was founded in 1948 after massmurder of the Palestinians and the stealing by terror and violence of thePalestinian homeland. The alleged connection of modern Jews to the biblicalIsraelites, the ‘twelve tribes’ and the ‘Diaspora’, or ‘Scattering’, is anenormous hoax concocted by the Rothschild dynasty – the creators of Zionism – tohoodwink both the Jewish population and the rest of the world. This fantasticconfidence trick (the bigger the lie the more will believe it) has had terribleconsequences for the Middle East, the Jewish people in general and the widerglobal population. The overwhelmingly Khazar origin of today’s Jewish people hasbeen confirmed by Jewish writers and historians, including Shlomo Sand,Professor of History at Tel Aviv University, in his book, The Invention of theJewish People. See Human Race Get Off You Knees and Remember Who You Are for thedetailed background to this extraordinary story and how the House of Rothschildorchestrated the entire creation of the fake State of Israel. Stewart Swerdlow,who is Jewish himself, writes in Blue Blood, True Blood:[../Images/00467.jpg]Figure 299: The vast majority of modern Jews originate from Khazaria andMesopotamia, not Israel. The historical claim to the lands of Palestine is agigantic hoax.> ... [the Sum-Aryans] mostly established themselves in the Caucasus Mountains> and [later] became the Khazars.

The family quickly took control of the> financial and trade foundations of Europe.The Archon hybrids infiltrated most societies as they expanded and interbred andtook control particularly of Europe where they installed their bloodline as thekings, queens and aristocracy in keeping with their obsession for hierarchicalstructures of power. This can be clearly seen at the time of Queen Victoria(1819-1901) when the ‘British’ royal family had offshoots all over Europe. TheFirst World War pitched Britain, with its monarch, King George V from the GermanHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, against Germany and its leader Kaiser Wilhelm ... acousin of King George V (Fig 300). The Kaiser was the first grandson of QueenVictoria and her German husband, Prince Albert. George V was the first cousin ofboth Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. George, Wilhelm andNicholas’ wife, Alexandra, were all grandchildren of Queen Victoria. What did Isay about El-ite bloodlines taking over the world? The British royal family onlybecame known as the Windsors to hide their German origins while Britain was atwar with another wing of the family in Germany. Anti-German sentiment wasunderstandably extreme in Britain during World War I and the popularity of theroyal family was not helped by the fact that the name of the heavy Germanaircraft with the capability of bombing London was the Gotha G.IV. So purely forpublic relations reasons and its own survival the British wing of the GermanHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha changed its name to Windsor in 1917 and the Britishwing of the German Battenbergs became the Mountbattens, as in Lord Mountbatten.Swish of the pen, change of the name. This has constantly happened throughoutwhat we call history and continues today as the hybrid bloodline families seekto hide their common origins. By the way, King George V’s wife at the time ofWorld War I was Mary of Teck, a bloodline descendent from the Transylvaniafamily of Vlad the Impaler from the Order of the Dragon. She was also fromGermany and she is an example of how the Archon bluebloods engage in arrangedmarriages to ensure that the bloodline remains ‘pure’. The Archons see theirgenetics as a software program ensuring common perception and behaviour and thisis quickly diluted if it is interbred with non-hybrids. I know that all humanbody-computers are hybrids because of the endless ‘downloads’ that have happenedinvolving many non-human sources, but I mean here the bloodlines specificallydesigned to serve the interests of the Demiurge-Archon agenda. Mary of Teck wasfirst betrothed to Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, but hesoon died, officially at least, of pneumonia. A year later she became engaged tohis brother, George, who went on to be King George V. It was in the script thatshe would be queen and bring her Vlad DNA with her to seed the next generationand so, like it or not, Georgie Five was told that she would be his wife. Thisis what happens still today and not only among official royalty, either. Thesame applies to the El-ite families of politics, banking, business and all therest. They are considered royalty and aristocracy within the network becausethey carry the bloodline and they must marry (interbreed) according to theArchons’ best interests. I have detailed in other books how the bloodlines alsohave breeding programmes in which women are artificially impregnated viabloodline sperm banks to ensure that the software program remains intact. Thesperm banks allow the major hybrid families such as the Rothschilds and Windsorsto impregnate very large numbers of women that do not carry their name. Thechildren from artificially impregnated mothers are apparently nothing to do withthese famous families, but they are the same bloodline and the same Archon dataprogram waiting to be activated. The children grow up with other names and arethen brought through into power in politics or other institutions that thebloodlines need to control. The different names hide the fact that they are thesame bloodline, the same Archon-Reptilian tribe. One unofficial offspring of theRothschild dynasty is called Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, but he is officiallyliving under another name in the United States after rejecting the family agendafor global conquest. He told me how the Rothschilds have hundreds of thousandsof children mostly produced through sperm bank breeding programmes. He said thathis father was the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschildwine estates in France and that his half-sister is the Baron’s daughter,Baroness Philippine de Rothschild, who inherited the wine empire (see Human RaceGet Off Your Knees and Remember Who You Are).[../Images/00220.jpg]Figure 300: The Kaiser and George – best of friends while their peoples were atwar.‘Colonialism’ – the expansion of Archontic controlThe Archon hybrids of Europe expanded across the world in the years ofcolonialism when countries like Britain, France, Spain and Portugal invaded andsecured control of much of the globe. With each new conquest the bloodline wasinstalled in power under different names and the secret society network thatserves Archon interests was introduced to covertly direct events in the countrytowards the global goal – the complete ‘physical’, mental and emotional controlof the entire human race. The bloodline passed through the centuries andmillennia in royal, aristocratic and colonial dictatorships, but there came atime when people were beginning to rebel against tyrannies that they couldclearly see. For the Archon plan to survive these overt dictatorships had to bereplaced by tyrannies that people couldn’t see hidden behind names like‘democracy’ and ‘independence’; but it was all a sleight-of-hand, all a colossalscam, and remains so today. The people were given the illusion of freedomthrough ‘democracy’ (the right to choose between ‘different’ masks on the samebloodline face) while the colonies were apparently given independence when allthat happened was a transition from overt to covert control. The colonial powersappeared to withdraw from Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australasia and elsewhere,but they left behind the bloodline under different names and impregnated intodifferent races along with the secret society network that serves bloodlineinterests. The Archon-possessed colonialists never left, except officially, andthat includes the United States which continues to be covertly controlled fromEurope and more latterly from the Rothschild fiefdom of Israel. The commondenominator in all cases is the House of Rothschild because they control thenetworks of power in the United States as they do in Israel, Europe, Russia,China etc., etc. I know that will sound far-fetched to many, but it’s not, andthe common connection is the Archon bloodlines. They have many races and manyfaces, but the same goal. The bloodlines gradually imposed a covert structure ofglobal control which is akin to a transnational corporation with ‘subsidiaries’in almost every country selecting the political leaders and controllinggovernment, finance, commerce and media in line with the Demiurge-Archon agendafor total human enslavement. I will explain more about how this structureoperates a little later. The most crucial advantage that the Archon bloodlineshave over humanity is simply knowledge and they have worked ceaselessly tomaintain that advantage by hording the advanced knowledge in the upper levels oftheir secret society network while blocking its circulation within mainstreamsociety. This is why they control the media, ‘education’, ‘science’ andacademia. They know how reality works – up to a point – and they know the truthabout the sequence of events that we call history. They clearly know who isdictating the direction of the world and what the ultimate outcome is designedto be because they are directing the world in pursuit of their desired outcome.They also know that humanity’s potential for creativity and ‘intentionality’means that we have far more power to influence reality than they do and so, morethan anything, human self-awareness has had to be suppressed at all costs. Thishas been done through their media, their ‘education’, their ‘science’, their‘academia’ and, most effectively of all, their religions. Yes, all of them. Iwill be dealing with each of these subjects as we go along.The use of knowledge is powerThe colonial powers of Europe, directed by the bloodline networks, did not sendtheir explorers like Christopher Columbus on hopeful and potentially pointlessjourneys across the oceans. They knew pretty much where they were going becauseancient maps of the world had been retained within the Mystery Schools and thesecret society networks that infiltrated and replaced them. One example is thePiri Reis Map of 1513 that includes North and South America, Greenland andAntarctica, the last of which would not be officially discovered until 1820.Piri Reis was a prominent admiral in the Turkish navy and this gave him accessto non-public sources to follow his passion for maps and map-making. He saidthat he met a sailor who claimed he had been one of the pilots working forChristopher Columbus on his journeys to the Caribbean and the Americas between1492 and1504. The pilot had said that he possessed the map of the world thatColumbus had been following. Reis said that he used that map to compile his ownand also included information from other ancient charts that he had collected.Many had been saved from the Gnostic-run Great Library of Alexandria before itwas destroyed and Hypatia murdered in 415. The Piri Reis map was discovered inthe archives of the Imperial Palace in Constantinople in 1929 and was found toaccurately portray the land contours of Antarctica which are covered by the icesheet and can only be traced using modern technology. Professor Charles HHapgood from Keene State College at the University of New Hampshire studied thisand other maps and produced a book called Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings in whichhe concludes that there must have once been a global society with advancedtechnology. He said that the ancient maps had survived when the civilisation hadbeen destroyed. Another theme of the colonial conquests by the Archon hybridbloodlines of Europe was of clear pre-knowledge of the cultures they weretargeting even before they ‘discovered’ them. Official history claims that itwas pure luck that Hernán Cortés, who led the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs inthe Central America, arrived on the same day in 1519 that Aztec prophecy saidwould see the return of their feathered-serpent god, Quetzalcoatl. Cortés hasbeen described as being ‘among history’s luckiest conquistadors’; but there wasnothing lucky about it. He turned up on the day that he knew would be mostlikely to make the Aztecs mistake him for Quetzalcoatl. It worked and before theAztecs realised their mistake the situation was irretrievable. Credo Mutwa toldme how strange people had arrived in Africa before the main invasions with adetailed knowledge of their customs and beliefs. This knowledge once againallowed for manipulation of African chiefs and others by making the ‘strangepeople’ appear to be the messengers of African gods. They became known by someas the one-legged people, or ‘monopods’, an illusion that came from the factthat they were Jesuit priests from the bloodline-created Roman Church who worelong black gowns.‘Novels’ based on factIf you have access to the inner circle of major Archon secret societies you haveaccess to knowledge – including the future direction of the ‘plan’ – that therest of the population is denied. This is how George Orwell and Aldous Huxleywere able to write their prophetic ‘novels’, 1984 and Brave New World. They werepublished in 1948 and 1932 and have proved to be incredibly accurate in thelight of current events. The Huxley family was big-time involved with the Archonbloodline networks. Aldous Huxley’s brother, Julian, was the first director ofthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)and a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund, much beloved by wildlifeassassin, Prince Philip, and his friend Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, aformer member of the Nazi SS. The mendacious manipulation of environmentalconcern, especially ‘climate change’, is being used as a prime excuse to imposeglobal control, of which much more later. Julian Huxley, like the family ingeneral, was a keen promoter of the eugenics ‘master race’ philosophy and waspresident of the British Eugenics Society. Aldous Huxley, like his brother, wasan inner circle member of the Fabian Society, a highly significant strand in thesecret society web, with its, oh, so appropriate logo of the wolf in sheep’sclothing (Fig 301). ‘Fabian’ comes from ‘Fabius’, the Roman general QuintusFabius Maximus Verrucosus. His claim to fame was to wear down the enemy overlong periods and avoid battles that could prove decisive either way. He and histroops would walk in and take over only when the enemy had been sufficientlyweakened. I have just described the very technique that has been used onhumanity since the Archon hijack and continues in extremis today. If you haveaccess to the inner core of the Fabian Society you will know about the projectedagenda for human enslavement. It just so happens that at one time Aldous Huxleytaught French at Eton, the super-exclusive college near Windsor Castle justoutside London where the royal children go and others from the most elite Archonbloodline families. One of Huxley’s pupils was a boy called Eric Blair, laterfar better known as ... George Orwell. Huxley introduced Orwell to the FabianSociety and the knowledge they both accessed allowed them to so accuratelyportray a global Big Brother state based on total control and, in Huxley’s case,manipulation by genetics, drugs and mind control to impose the will of theArchon few on the human many. Huxley supported the ‘cause’ while Orwell workedalmost to his dying day to expose it in 1984 (the year that marked the 100thanniversary of the Fabian Society). By the way, the Fabian Society alsoestablished and still directs the London School of Economics, one of theforemost ‘education’ centres for developing and recruiting the Archon bloodlineoperatives of the next generation (see Human Race Get Off Your Knees). I alsotell the story in the same book and Remember Who You Are of Dr Richard Day, aRockefeller (Archon bloodline) insider, who told a group of paediatricians inPennsylvania in 1969 how America and the world was going to change in line witha global plan. What he said has since proved to be correct in virtually everydetail. All these people knew what was planned because there is a knowledge basewithin the network that is very different to the one in the public domain.Another aspect to the way advanced knowledge was employed by the powers thatcolonised the world from their headquarters in Europe involves language(frequency, vibration). Whenever colonialists conquered a country they imposedtheir own language – this is why South Americans today speak Spanish orPortuguese while their original languages are marginalised, discouraged and evenofficially suppressed. The inner sanctums of the Archon secret societies knowthat if you change the language you change the vibration (information fields) ofthe people and their society. English is the most effective vibrational prisonwithin modern languages and so it has been promoted to worldwide prominence.[../Images/00385.jpg]Figure 301: The Fabian Society is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.Coming and going ...Now, one more point about the Archon bloodlines which has got me lots ofridicule from the media and those that the media tells what to think –shapeshifting. Yes, the human-Archon hybrids can morph between human, reptilianand other forms because, well, they are human-Archon hybrids. Shapeshifting isimpossible? No, it’s very logical and straightforward when you understandreality. People dismiss the very idea because they believe that the world is‘solid’ and ‘physical’. If it were this would preclude shapeshifting, of course,but it isn’t. We are back to those few cubic centimetres at the back of thebrain where we construct our visual reality. This is where shapeshiftingactually takes place. The brain first decodes the human energetic field of theArchon hybrids and then, when the reptilian or other Archon information fieldbecomes the dominant one, the brain decodes that. To the observer of decodedholographic reality a person will appear to have changed from a solid form intoanother solid form; but it is all illusion. The brain has been decoding thehuman field, then suddenly switches its attention to the Archon field and thusone holographic form appears to ‘shapeshift’ into another (Fig 302). Think of itof two television channels mixing from one to the other as you press the zapper.Stewart Swerdlow’s information from his Montauk experience was that the ‘Archongeneticists’ are ideally looking for a 50-50 ratio between human andArchon-Reptilian genetics. This combination is designed to produce a form thatlooks human, but can shapeshift back to Archon-Reptilian by ‘concentrating onthe genetics the hybrid [wishes] to open, or lock up, whatever the case may be’.Marriages and relationships between hybrid families are carefully selected in aneffort to maintain this human-Archon parity and the sperm banks do thistechnologically. The marriage of Prince Charles to Princess Diana (Lady DianaSpencer) in 1981 at St Paul’s Cathedral (the site where the Romans worshippedthe ancient Archon Goddess Diana) was an infamous case of an arranged bloodlinegenetic partnership (Fig 303). Diana didn’t know at first, but the royal innercircle did. Charles’ personal choice was Camilla Parker-Bowles, but these peoplehave to do their genetic duty. I have told the Diana story in detail in my book,The Biggest Secret, and exposed the blood-drinking and human sacrifice by theBritish royal family. One of my many sources was Christine Fitzgerald, analternative healer that Diana often visited and they were close friends for nineyears. Christine told me in recorded interviews that Diana’s nicknames for theWindsors were ‘the lizards’ and ‘the reptiles’ and she would say ‘they’re nothuman’. Diana’s grandmothers, the Countess Spencer and Ruth Lady Fermoy, wereinner circle members of the late Queen Mother’s court and so were four of hergreat aunts. The Spencers and the Queen Mother were very close and Diana wasborn on the royal estate at Sandringham in North Norfolk where the Spencers hada house. Lady Fermoy and the Queen Mother manipulated Diana into the marriagewith Prince Charles. Diana was imprisoned at the Queen Mother’s home, ClarenceHouse, across from Buckingham Palace, in the weeks before the wedding to ensurethat she could not pull out – which she wanted to do at a very late stage.Christine Fitzgerald said that Diana was told by her family: ‘Your face is onthe tea towels and you’re too late to chicken out.’ Diana’s journey to St Paul’sCathedral that fateful day of June 29th, 1981 began at Clarence House and shetold Christine Fitzgerald that she had felt a deathly calm: ‘I felt I was a lambto the slaughter. I knew it, and I couldn’t do anything about it.’ Sixteen yearslater, with William the heir to the Windsor dynasty duly produced, Diana wasdead in an engineered car crash (see The Biggest Secret). Diana’s other son,Prince Harry, is clearly not Charles’ child – you only have to look at Williamand Charles and then Harry to see that. Hello? It is the elephant in the livingroom that the media doesn’t talk about. Harry is, however, the spitting image atthe same age of Captain James Hewitt with whom Diana had a relationship afterthe non-marriage with Charles began to break down (Fig 304). Diana describedherself as the Windsors’ ‘brood mare’ to produce Windsor heirs with Spencergenetics and the reason for this was that the Windsors Archon/Reptilianhumangenetic balance was approaching Archon-Reptilian domination and with that theinability to retain human form. They needed an infusion of the preferredblonde-haired, blue-eyed genetics to redress the balance and they now have thatwith William. Diana became an outcast once this was done and Charles ran acovert relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles using the code names ‘Gladys andFred’. They subsequently married and she became a member of the Windsor versionof the Addams family.[../Images/00246.jpg]Figure 302: Shapeshifting only takes place within the decoding processes of theobserver. The shift is energetic, not ‘physical’, because there is no‘physical’.[../Images/00227.jpg]Figure 303: The marriage of genetic convenience for the Archon Windsor clan.[../Images/00147.jpg]Figure 304: Hewitt, Harry and Charles – it’s not obvious is it?Archontic AmericaThe legends and accounts about the Archons, Jinn, Chitauri, Nagas and theserpent sea and fish gods of Sumer and Babylon were all said to shapeshift andmove in and out of human form. I have been told by hundreds of people around theworld from all walks of life about their experiences of seeing people shapeshiftfrom human to reptilian and other forms and back again. Survivors ofgovernment-military mind control programmes in many countries have described tome how they often witnessed shapeshifting. One was Cathy O’Brien, an Americanwho was held captive from the time she was a small child in a mind controlprogramme called Project Monarch (named after the Monarch butterfly). Watch forcelebrities portrayed with butterflies because it is often symbolic of theirMonarch programming. Project Monarch was an ‘elite’ offshoot of the horrificMKUltra, a mind control programme operated by agencies including the CIA. Itsexistence was made public in the 1970s, but the true depth of its evil and scalewas covered up by an official ‘investigation’ headed by ... Nelson Rockefeller.An Archon bloodline mind control programme ‘investigated’ by an Archon bloodlineasset. Rockefeller was four-times Governor of New York (a post always securedfor a bloodline asset) and US vice-president to the unelected shapeshifter,Gerald Ford, who came to power in the wake of the Watergate scandal designed tooust Richard Nixon. It was Ford who appointed Rockefeller to head the MKUltra‘inquiry’. This is how the bloodlines operate. Ford himself had been involved inMKUltra and Project Monarch. He was a Congressman for Cathy O’Brien’s home stateof Michigan when he arrived at her house to take her away with the full approvalof her Satanist family. Cathy tells the detailed story of what happened to herin a book called Trance-Formation of America, co-written with partner, MarkPhillips, who helped her to begin the long task of deprogramming. ProjectMonarch put Cathy together with US presidents and other major political figuresbecause they could rape and abuse her and, in the case of Father George Bush,rape, abuse and torture her young born-in-captivity daughter, Kelly, with nochance of the truth coming out. They were held in captivity and their memoriesof the abuse locked behind firewalls installed in their mind. Cathy describes inher book how she saw Father George Bush shapeshift into a reptilian form. Shesays that Bush opened a book at a page depicting ‘lizard-like aliens’ and saidthat he was from ‘a far off, deep space place’. As he did so, he transformed‘like a chameleon’ into a reptile. Cathy tells of another experience at NASA’sGoddard Space Flight Centre mind control laboratory near Washington DC with twoFather Bush associates, Bill and Bob Bennett. Brutal Bill was United StatesSecretary of Education under Reagan-Bush (actually Bush-Reagan) and Director ofthe Office of National Drug Control Policy (or ‘Drug Czar’) during the Bushpresidency. This is not surprising given that the bloodlines run the global drugtrade and so put their own people in the key positions of drug policy andenforcement to make sure they are never caught. Only the small fry are caught –and the competition. Brutal Bob Bennett is an American attorney best known forrepresenting President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Cathydescribed what happened with the Bennetts after she was given mind-alteringdrugs:> In the darkness around me I could hear Bill Bennett talking: ‘This is my> brother, Bob. He and I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension – two> beings from another plane.’ The hi-tech light display swirling around me> convinced me I was transforming dimensions with them. A laser of light hit the> black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a> White House cocktail party – as though I had transformed dimensions and stood> amongst them. Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked: ‘Who are these> people?’> ‘They’re not people and this isn’t a spaceship’, [Bill] Bennett said. As he> spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people> appeared to be lizard-like aliens. ‘Welcome to the second level of the> underground. This is a mere mirror reflection of the first, an alien> dimension. We are from a trans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses> all dimensions.’> ‘I have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishing stronger> holds on your mind than the Earth plane permits,’ Bill Bennett was saying.> ‘Being alien, I simply make my thoughts your thoughts by projecting them into> your mind. My thoughts are your thoughts.’As Don Juan Matus said: ‘They gave us their mind.’ In the case of the Bennett‘mind’, they can keep it, thank you. Cathy also describes an experience that shehad with Miguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico during Father Bush’speriod at the White House. She writes in Trance-Formation of America:> De La Madrid had relayed the ‘legend of the Iguana’ to me, explaining that> lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, their> advanced astronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was> supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens> interbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit, they> fluctuated between a human and Iguana appearance through chameleon-like> abilities – ‘a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders’. De la> Madrid claimed to have Mayan/alien ancestry in his blood, whereby he> transformed back into an Iguana at will.Remember how the Mayans said that a reptilian race known as the ‘Iguana Men’ andtheir leader, the ‘feathered serpent’ Kukulkan, had come from the sky tointerbreed with them and teach them how to build pyramids? Decoded Mayanhieroglyphics reveal an obsession by their ‘royal’ families with tracing theirlineage back to the interbreeding with the ‘gods’ and how this geneticinheritance gave them the right to rule on behalf of those gods. Cathy believedher experiences to be mind control trickery to confuse her, and that’sunderstandable, but I have spoken with hundreds of people who have had similarexperiences in everyday life who have not been near a mind control programme.What the Bennetts said also fits perfectly with the way the Gnostics and otherpeoples described the actions and nature of the Archons, Jinn, Flyers and allthe rest. There are the endless accounts in the ancient world that describe thesame phenomenon that Cathy O’Brien experienced. You will find a host of storiesand experiences of people who have seen the shapeshifting of famous people andothers in books like The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix.The black-eyed peopleI have seen people’s eyes shift from human form to something certainly not humanand this happened most memorably with the late British Prime Minister EdwardHeath at the Sky television studios in London in 1989 (Fig 305). I knew nothingabout any of this information at the time. I was a television presenter with theBBC and a national spokesman for the British Green Party and I had arrived atthe studio to be interviewed live on the night the results came in for electionsto the European Parliament. I was met at reception and taken to the make- uproom. It seemed to be empty as I walked through the open door and the lady saidthat someone would be along to see me soon. I sat in a chair facing the make-upmirror thinking that I was alone, but I saw something in the corner of my eyeand turned to see Ted Heath who was sitting behind the door waiting for hismake-up to be removed after an earlier interview. I gave him a friendly ‘hello’,but he did not respond in any way. Then he turned to face me. No words werespoken at any time. His head was still, but he moved his eyes to the top of myhead and slowly down to my feet and then back again. At that point he turnedback and faced the mirror. I can only describe what he did as like being scanned– yes, scanning my energy field. He had a really inquisitive look on his face ashe did so ... a sort of ‘Mmmm, what’s this?’ The biological programs runningthrough the hybrid’s DNA has not suppressed many of the latent ‘sixth’ senses asthey have in humans and so they can see reality beyond the holographic,including the human auric field. The most extraordinary part of the experiencewas that during the ‘scanning’ his eyes turned jet back. I mean the whole of theeyes, including the whites. I described it later as like looking into two blackholes. There was no point where I made eye contact because there were no eyes.There were only two black channels through which I was looking into anotherdimension – the realm of the Archons as I would say now. I had no idea what washappening at the time, but it is clear with the benefit of decades of researchand awareness expansion that I was looking through Heath’s visible-light humanhologram or projection into the realms of manipulation that were possessing thehologram and hiding behind Heath’s apparently human form (Fig 306). I have heardand read stories around the world since then about what are called the‘black-eyed people’ and what is said about them reflects my experience withHeath. It was therefore no surprise some years later to be told by many crediblesources that Heath was a child-sacrificing reptilian shapeshifter. A friend sentme a picture of US Vice-President Joe Biden at Obama’s 2013 State of theUnion-address that reminded me distinctly of what I saw when I looked at Heath(Fig 307). I also came across the work in 2013 of researcher David Weatherly andhis book, Black Eyed Children, in which he describes a recurring phenomenon ofpale-faced children, usually in threes and aged between around 10 and 13, whoknock persistently on people’s doors (never using the doorbell apparently) andask to come in. People report a sense of unease and foreboding during theseencounters even before the children reveal their ‘solid black eyes’ (preciselywhat I saw with Heath). They also describe a putrid smell, very much likesulphur – a common theme of those who have experienced Grey or reptilianentities. Weatherly said that it appeared to be the goal of these strange‘children’ to ‘create this high level of fear in the victim’ and he speculatesthat they could be demonic entities or ‘alien hybrids’ feeding off the target’sfear. This fits with what I have described about fear and death being thesustenance of the Archons. The ‘children’ simply ‘disappear when the encountersare over – leave our frequency range. British Prime Minister Edward Heath was ablack-eyed Archon hybrid and this explains so much about him, as we shall see.[../Images/00183.jpg]Figure 305: Edward Heath[../Images/00554.jpg]Figure 306: Heath as he appeared to me at Sky Television.[../Images/00488.jpg]Figure 307: Joe Biden, black-eyed-un.I went to see a woman before I had gone public on the reptilian information totalk about her experiences of Satanism at an area of woodland and clearingscalled Burnham Beeches just west of London. The land is owned by ‘The City’, thefinancial district of London and an Archon bloodline centre of globalimportance. The woman’s former husband, a Satanist she told me, was employed asthe warden to look after the ‘Beeches’ and arrange the rituals for prominentSatanists and others. They lived in a house on the land which is very dark andsecluded at night. I chatted to her for some time about her experience as theone-time wife of a Satanist and then, as I was putting down my tea cup andturning to leave, I said in passing that I was having some very strangeconversations with people who said they had seen humans turn into reptiles. Iimmediately heard her gasp a breath and I turned to see her clutching her chestin a state of some shock. She told me that she had not mentioned her reptilianexperiences because she thought that this would sound crazy even for me. Itdidn’t – I was already on the case. She described seeing figures in the woods atdusk wearing robes and hoods and with reptilian faces when they turned to lookat her. Then she told me about Heath. She said that late one night in the 1970swhen Heath was Prime Minister she took her dog for a walk and saw some lightsthrough the trees. She went to investigate and got as close as she could withoutbeing seen. She saw to her amazement a satanic ritual circle which included therobed Ted Heath and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anthony Barber. Heathappeared to be leading the ritual and as she watched she said that Heath beganto shapeshift into a reptilian entity. She said that no one in the circle lookedin any way fazed by this and they acted as if it was the most natural thing inthe world to them. ‘He eventually became a full-bodied Reptiloid, growing insize by some two foot’, she told me. This is a very common description amongthose who say they have experienced shapeshifting. The reptilian figure is muchtaller than the human. Remember that we are talking about a switch between twoinformation fields and they can be encoded to grow as big or as small as theencoding dictates. The woman said that Heath was ‘slightly scaly’ and ‘spokefairly naturally, although it sounded like long distance – if you can imaginethe short time lapses’ (as with the old transatlantic telephone calls). This wasHeath’s Archon-self talking from its own reality – the one that I was lookinginto through his black eyes. Burnham Beeches is little more than half an hour’sdrive from the British prime minister’s country residence at Chequers (a gameplayed with black and white squares like the Freemasonic floor). Heath was onceseen by the media walking arm in arm with Madonna into an exclusive Londonrestaurant. ‘She is a highly intelligent woman’, Heath said later. I wonder whatshe and the shapeshifting Satanist could have found to talk about?The Archon bloodlines have not only infiltrated royalty, politics, banking,corporations, media etc. They are also controlling academia, science, medicineand the entertainment industry – a prime form of mass perception programming.You also find them controlling the religions (which they introduced) andmisdirecting and undermining the New Age arena (which they introduced) and thatof conspiracy and UFO research which they constantly seek to manipulate. Ofcourse that must be the case when they are trying to suppress information thatwould awaken humanity to its plight and its true power. The Archons want theirown on the inside wherever possible. I attended a conspiracy conference inCalifornia many years ago in which multiple speakers were appearing. I walkedinto a room at the hotel while the event was in progress where books and suchlike were being sold between speaking sessions. The room was empty apart fromone man who was approaching the global conspiracy from the Christian Patriotdirection. He said as we chatted that he liked my information, but he could notget his head around the reptilian shapeshifting stuff. I said, as I do toeveryone, that he should take what feels right to him and leave the rest and seewhat happens. The following day he came up to me and said ‘I know what you meannow’. A particular speaker and ‘researcher’ had taken great exception tosomething that the man had written in his conspiracy newspaper about Zionism andstarted a very loud and hostile argument in the hotel bar next to the lobby. Ihad met this speaker a few times over the years, unfortunately, and I found himto be very cold, arrogant, self-obsessed and an extremely nasty piece of work –all Archon bloodline traits. He never looked me in the eye, either, alwayslooking to the right or left and often at close range for some reason. I thinkthe phrase is ‘in your face’. I had him down not to be trusted from day one.Anyway, the argument in the bar reached such proportions that the hotel managerasked the two of them to leave because they were upsetting other guests and thenewspaper editor told me that he headed for the elevator to get away from theabuse. He said that he walked into the elevator and turned around to face thedoor as it was closing. But just before the doors met, an arm was pushed throughand they reopened. It was the speaker chap who, the man told me, proceeded toput his face right in front of his (been there) and as the speaker continued tovent his fury his face shapeshifted into a reptilian form. I have heard so manystories that describe people shifting when in a state of extreme anger and fury.It happens because their emotional state shoots an electrical charge through theDNA and causes it to distort or shift into the Archon-Reptilian codes. Thesethen project the Archon-Reptilian information field and to the observer theperson has shapeshifted from human to reptilian. As the distortion correctsitself, the human form returns. Shapeshifting is not a physical body changinginto another physical body because there is no physical. It is this lack ofunderstanding among media and public that prompt reflex-action dismissal andridicule when I speak of this phenomena. The DNA that scientists think they seeis only the holographic expression of decoded waveform information. The duel DNAof the Archon hybrids is also decoded waveform information. There is no physicalshift, but a shift at the waveform level when the Archon-Reptilian fielddominates the human field as the codes are switched.People talk bollocks – as in shapeshifting is impossible – because theirperceptions of reality and possibility have been programmed by bollocks alltheir lives. That’s how we got into this bollocks and we’ll stay there until wereverse the process by ceasing to be unquestioning software programs and expandour sense of the possible."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00272.jpg]Pyramid PowerBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.SocratesI have written and spoken extensively about the global structure that allows thefew to direct the lives of the many and I have documented at great length themass mind and emotional manipulation techniques that are constantly employed tothis end. I am not going to repeat it all here in detail because this isavailable in other books. I will purposely keep it short and to the point, but Ido need to outline the basic structure and techniques for those who are readingmy work for the first time.Among the biggest blocks on people accepting the global conspiracy is that theycannot conceive that it could be possible. How could a few manipulate worldevents and the lives of billions? It can’t be done, so the idea of a conspiracymust be crazy – bye. I see this response constantly from ‘journalists’ and thepublic, and do they ever research and check it out for themselves? No. Theirprogrammed minds have decided that it’s not possible because they lack theimagination to conceive that it’s possible or the will to even pursue thepossibility, and so that for them is the end of the story. The Moon is notnatural, or totally natural? Same reaction – and even, even more so. There is aMind-Matrix connected to the Moon and Saturn manipulating human perception?Same, even, more so. I say to dismissive journalists and interviewers sometimes:‘I have spent nearly a quarter of a century researching this subject full timein more than 50 countries – how much research have you done?’ The answer isnone. But they still feel entitled to dismiss something they know absolutelynothing about. In fact, ‘they’ are not dismissing it. The programs that dictatetheir perceptions are doing the dismissing as they run through their non-codingDNA. ‘Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance’, AlbertEinstein is quoted as saying. This is a brilliant summary of widespread humanperception and response. The structure that allows the few to control the restcan be explained very simply, but most won’t stop to listen – at ultimate costto themselves and even more so to their children and grandchildren. So manypeople are struggling and suffering today from coldly-engineered economic chaosand deprivation because when it was being orchestrated they were watching thegame show or the football, or dismissing the very idea that there is a globalconspiracy to enslave the masses, not least through economic means.The globalisation of human controlThe hybrids and their most elite agents and gofers with full knowledge of whatthey are doing can be symbolically counted on one hand compared with the humanpopulation. So any structure of global control must have as a prime necessitythe constant and incessant centralisation of power. With every step along thatroad the fewer and fewer are securing power over the more and more. Another‘must have’ is that the knowledge of what is really happening must be kept onlyto those who absolutely have to know. Everyone else in the structure is allowedonly enough information to make their contribution in ignorance of what they areultimately contributing to. This applies right down the pyramid to the generalpublic and the lower you go the greater the ignorance of what is going on unlessyou make it your business to find out (Fig 308). Intelligence agencies operateon the same principle of ‘compartmentalisation’ with knowledge distributed onlyon the basis of a ‘need to know’. The Archon bloodline Cabal imposed theircontrol structure in the countries that they colonised from Europe and when theyapparently ‘withdrew’ and ‘awarded independence’ that structure remained inplace. This included the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa,Central and South America and the Far East. The structure consists of a networkof secret societies and satanic groupings headed by Archon bloodline familiesand their corrupt agents that covertly dictate events through politics, financeand corporations, very much including the mainstream media. Here you have themain reason why so many former colonies have since been run by tyrants andcrooks (elected and unelected) that answer to foreign interests and thebloodline-created-and-controlled transnational corporations. The corporationssteal a country’s land and resources and grow cashcrops for the Western marketswhile many in the population go hungry and live in abject poverty for lack ofaccess to their own land. This is also why the price of commodities andresources from these former colonies is not set by them, but by the heartlessArchon financial markets in Wall Street and ‘The City’ of London. The physicaloccupation of the former colonies worldwide was replaced by financial occupationthrough manufactured ‘Third World debt’ (see ... And The Truth Shall Set YouFree) and now we are seeing the return of physical occupation, especially inAfrica and the Middle and Near East, through direct invasion and ‘rebel’mercenaries triggering ‘peoples revolutions’ which are nothing more than frontsfor the Archon bloodline networks that control the United States, Britain andNATO (see Remember Who You Are). The so-called ‘Arab Spring’ can be described ina single sentence: People with brown faces being played off against people withbrown faces so that people with white faces can steal their land. The techniqueis simple. You covertly fund, arm and train ‘rebels’ in a country like Libya andSyria and order them to attack government and civilian targets. Nothing is saidin the media at this point because you don’t want the public to know how it allstarted. Government troops then respond to the ‘rebel’ attacks and at this pointthe global media, the prostitutes and soul-sellers at the BBC, CNN, Fox News,MSNBC and all the rest, begin to hysterically report the official line that thetarget regime is killing its own people and must be ‘regime-changed’ by bombingcivilians from the air or by having them murdered by the ‘rebels’. Even the thenItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has said publicly since the Libyainvasion that it was not an ‘Arab Spring’ or people’s revolution, but aninvasion by the international community using the ‘rebels’ as the excuse. I amnot saying that Gaddafi in Libya or Assad in Syria arrived from the angelicrealm, but ask the great majority of the people if they would rather live inLibya and Syria as they were or what they have become thanks to American,British and NATO (bloodline) intervention. Libya is now in bloody and violentchaos and this is spreading across North and West Africa as the crazies seek todivide and rule the entire continent and acquire its land and resources as theyhave with the Libyan oil, gas and once semi-independent banking system. RifaatSayed Ahmad, Director of the Cairo-based Java Center for Political Studies, saidNATO bombing had replaced Gaddafi with what looked more like medieval rule than‘democracy’:[../Images/00455.jpg]Figure 308: The structure of human control through the suppression of knowledge.> NATO air strikes threw the once prospering country by African standards back> into the Middle Ages, and still worse, they plunged it into a civil war.

The story ofPlanet Earth is complex and I am trying to keep it simple and most relevant towhat is happening today, but something to emphasise is that the Archons have hadtheir high-technology throughout what we call human history. They had anadvanced knowledge of genetics, computers, nanotechnology and all the rest whilehumans recovering from the cataclysm were knocking rocks together. But what isthe point of giving a computer to a caveman? It was this technologicalcapability and their non-human form that made Archons in their many guisesappear to be gods. These technological and reality-manipulating capabilities,which are well beyond where human science is even today, were the source of thefantastic structures in the ancient world that mainstream scientists attributeto an otherwise primitive people. The plan was to guide human development towhere they would be able to operate Archon technology to the point where theycould use it to enslave themselves. This is precisely what is happening now.‘Modern’ technology (still the Stone Age of what is possible) has allowed formass surveillance, electromagnetic mind manipulation, genetic modificationthrough food and drink, and the killing of more people than ever before in knownhuman history. This has been introduced drip by drip by drip as many humans havereached the stage where they can employ the technology and use it to changesociety. Most of these people have been Archon-controlled, but most will not beaware of that. To them it would have been done from their own inspiration.Technologies of control and human health destruction are developed today in deepunderground bases (or DUMBS) where at the deepest levels they connect with theunderground cities of the Archons. Cover stories and cover people are concoctedand employed to explain how any new technology to advance human control wasinvented and where it came from. This can be very financially rewarding for thecover story front-people. New technology is just pouring out today as theArchons seek to race to their goal of total human control. Computers, theInternet, mobile phones and their communication masts are all part of this. Theaim is to eventually use technology to turn humans into a cyborg race – thetranshumanist agenda – which is what the Archons are. They gave us their mindand now they want to give us their body-type. All this has been unfolding sincethey gained substantial control of human thought, emotion and genetics and weneed to throw a spanner in their works – and fast. The ear-phone devices thatincreasing numbers of people wear all day (and killing themselves in doing so)are an example of how humans are being quietly conditioned to add technology tothe body and think nothing of it.Gimme the powerKnown human history can be seen as a constant centralisation of global powerwhich has got faster and faster. This happens because the more you centralisepower the more power you have at the centre to centralise even quicker. What haslong been termed ‘globalisation’ – the centralisation of global power in allareas of our lives – has not happened by chance. It is the Archon agendaunfolding. I see the mass protests about the exploitation and suffering thatglobalisation has inflicted upon billions, but the protestors don’t see thatglobalisation is part of an enormous multi-levelled, multidimensional plan forhuman suppression which Orwell, if anything, understated. They see what ishappening as basically greedy corporations exploiting the masses; but thecorporations are not the origin of this exploitation and suppression; they aremerely vehicles for it. There was a time when humans lived in tribes and theyall decided what the tribe would do. Then the tribes were pulled together intowhat are called countries and nations and the few at the centre of the nation(government) were now dictating to all the former tribes. The next stage ofabsorbing all the nations into centralised superstate dictatorships like thefascist/communist European Union is well advanced today, especially in Europe. Afew unelected dark suits in Brussels dictate the lives in fine detail of morethan 500 million people right across the continent. The same is planned forother parts of the world. The European Union (EU) was fashioned by stealth outof a free-trade area called the European Economic Community, or Common Market.The same scam is being employed elsewhere. The North American Union (the UnitedStates, Canada and Mexico) is being manipulated into being, out of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and they eventually want a union of thewhole of the Americas. A Pacific/Asia Union or Unions in Asia, the Far East,Australia and New Zealand are planned to evolve from the trade groupingscurrently known as Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). We already have the African Union whichreplaced the Organisation of African Unity and other groups. There will be asuperstate planned in the Middle East, too. Archon Russian President VladimirPutin has called for a ‘Common Economic Space’ between Russia and the EuropeanUnion and also a Eurasian Union to include Russia and other former states of theSoviet Union. But this is nowhere near the end of it. The Archons are usingtheir hybrids to impose a global structure based on a world government, worldcentral bank, world currency and world army (Fig 309). This global dictatorshipwould control the next layer of collective superstate ‘unions’ and the currentnation states would be broken up into powerless regions to negate any unifiedresponse to this global control structure. The population would also be subjectto compulsory microchipping, including children from birth, and I will discussthe implications of this later on. The equation is simple: the more power isconcentrated globally, the more power the Archon bloodlines, and so theDemiurge-Archons, will have over human society (Fig 310). The world government –the Archon bloodlines – would dictate to every person on the planet and theworld army would impose the will of the world government on any country, regionor community that refused to obey. We already have a de-facto world governmentunder codenames like the ‘G-8’, ‘G-20’ and the United Nations Security Council.Proposals for global United Nations taxation in the form of things like carbonand currency taxes are the stepping-stones to funding the world government. Wealready have a de-facto world army called NATO. The UN Security Council,dominated by the permanent members, the United States, Britain, France, Russiaand China, decides that this or that country is not playing ball with theirplans – Libya for example – and the NATO killing machine is deployed to removethem. This is what they plan to happen officially with a world army enforcingthe will of the world government dictatorship. I said in the mid-1990s thatpeople should watch for NATO operating outside its designated area as itexpanded to become the world army. We have since had NATO in action on multiplecontinents and insiders like Daniel Fried of the US State Department arepromoting continued NATO expansion. He told the House Committee on ForeignAffairs’ Subcommittee on Europe:[../Images/00524.jpg]Figure 309: The global Control System that the Archons and their bloodlines areseeking to impose with other ‘Unions’ also planned.[../Images/00561.jpg]Figure 310: All roads in the end lead to the Archons.> When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, NATO was an Alliance of 16 members and no> partners. Today, NATO has 26 members – with 2 new invitees, prospective> membership for others, and over 20 partners in Europe and Eurasia, seven in> the Mediterranean, four in the Persian Gulf, and others from around the world.The global dictatorship would also have a series of ministries to control allareas of human life and these would replace the major corporations and cartelsthat we see today. This wouldn’t matter to the Archons because they control thecorporations and cartels and they would control the ministries. It just furthercentralises power over the human population. There would be an energy ministry(controlling all oil and other energy resources and distribution); a foodministry (controlling all food production and distribution with food growing –even in your own garden – banned for everyone except officially-accreditedsources); a trade ministry (controlling global trade at all levels); a ‘health’ministry (controlling all production and distribution of pharmaceutical drugs,enforcing mass mandatory vaccinations and banning all natural health supplementsand alternative treatments); a world biotech ministry (controlling theproduction, development and use of biotechnology to systematically transform andfurther distort the DNA of humans and the natural world). There would be manyother specialised ministries, including the security ministry which wouldoversee the global Orwellian police state that would amalgamate all police andmilitary groupings into a one world military police force. This would be asubdivision of the world army. It is no good people saying that this would neverhappen because it is already happening. We have the emerging de-facto versionsof these ministries as the pieces are put in place in the form of groupings likethe oil and pharmaceutical cartels and the Archon bloodlinecreated World TradeOrganization (WTO) and World Health Organization (WHO) which dictate globalpolicy in their field. Global policy under one roof is what the bloodline cabalare seeking to impose for everything and it is hardly a shock, therefore, thatthe Archon Rothschilds and Rockefellers were behind the creation of the WTO andWHO and the other global dictatorships in a range of policy areas.They are quite happy for people to be angry at the activities of banks andcorporations because that will encourage the population to support theestablishment of these global ministries. This is a technique that I callProblem-Reaction-Solution which I will explain later. The planned world centralbank (finance ministry) would dictate all global finance (in other words, humanchoice) and the planned world single currency (purely electronic, no cash) wouldallow the global dictators to both control all financial transactions and blockthe ability to purchase anything for anyone they choose. If you hand overelectronic money today and the computer system refuses to accept your creditcard you can still pay cash, although that is going out of circulation so fast.But when there is no cash how do you purchase or acquire anything, includingfood, short of barter or as a gift? You don’t. This is the idea of the cashlesssociety – control. Cash is disappearing by the day and countries like Sweden arevirtually cashless already. BA International, a banknote printing operation inOttawa, Canada, owned by Giesecke & Devrient in Germany, stopped printingcurrency on January 1st, 2013, citing a decrease in demand for banknotes. Thisagenda is behind outrageous fascism that can be seen in places like Floridawhere a ludicrous ‘court’ of three ‘judges’ upheld the right of privateoperators of toll roads and the Florida Department of Transportation to detaindrivers and hold them hostage for paying the toll with high denomination bills,sometimes even as low as $5. The message intended is that if you won’t give upcash this is what happens. Observe the consequences for Greece of being lockedinto a single currency over which it has no control when the plan is for aglobal single currency. Greece today will be the world tomorrow, if we allow itto happen. The introduction of the European single currency, the euro, was neveran end in itself. It was only a step towards the goal of a single electronicglobal currency, just as the creation of the European Central Bank (ECB) was astep towards a world central bank. The euro’s job was just to mop up all theprevious individual currencies in Europe like the deutschmark, lira, guilder,franc and peseta. It was always planned that the euro would eventually fail andopen the way for a world currency. A world central bank is now being called forby the Archon-controlled Vatican, Archon political leaders and Archon financialmanipulators like billionaire Rothschild frontman, George Soros. When you havebeen on this journey of discovery for as long as I have what is happening todayis an open book and ever more people are beginning to see the obvious. Few ofthem are called ‘journalists’, however. There is so much more in the plan beyondpolitical, financial and military control and I will be laying this out strandby strand as we go along.[../Images/00242.jpg]Figure 311: The global ‘corporation’ of bloodlines and secret societies.The BlueprintAll this daily manipulation of events, legislation and people’s lives is madepossible by the global structure that the Archon bloodlines have been puttinginto place brick-by-brick for thousands of years. This operates just like atransnational corporation. In fact, the global corporations are subdivisions ofthe overall structure and so they are themselves structured, as per holographicblueprint, in the same way. I will refer to this holographic web or structure as‘The Blueprint’ because you find it everywhere the Archon bloodline cabal is atwork (Fig 311). Transnational corporations have a headquarters somewhere in theworld and they dictate the global policy or blueprint that all theirsubsidiaries have to follow. Go into a McDonald’s ‘restaurant’ (no, pleasedon’t) anywhere on the planet and you will see the same McDonald’s corporatestyle and way of working. This applies to Coca-Cola and all the other corporatebrands and methods of operation. The Archon bloodline structure of globalcontrol works in the same way and it allows the same laws to be introduced andchanges secured all over the world at around the same time. The Blueprintstructure is holographic and so every part is a smaller version of the whole.The operational headquarters are in Europe and dictate the global agenda onbehalf of their hidden Archon masters. Bloodline families in each country, withtheir different races and names, have the role with their secret societynetworks of implementing the plan (in the sequence dictated by the headquarters)in their sphere of influence – their country. These subsidiary bloodlines andsecret societies control their country’s politics, finance, media and otherinstitutions and the national networks have their own subsidiaries in theregions, cities and towns. This allows the headquarters in Europe to directevents and people down through the national networks and into local communitiesright across the world. You can symbolise the Blueprint as a spider’s web witheach strand representing a secret society or semi-secret group (Fig 312). Thecloser to the spider they are the more secretive and exclusive are the groupsinvolved, and as you expand out from the spider to the edges of the web youeventually meet organisations, corporations and governments that people areaware of in the public arena; but they all answer to the dictates of the spiderand the spider answers to the Demiurge-Archons. Some of the close-to-the spidersecret societies are the Jesuits, Knights Templar and Opus Dei, all connected tothe Roman Church, and the upper reaches of the Freemasons; but there aresuper-secret groupings that are not publicly-known which connect directly withthe spider and some have no official names because it is harder to tracksomething that doesn’t have a name. We know about the royal families of Europeand the House of Rothschild and the Rockefellers, etc., but there will be otherfamilies and individuals above them in the network that are never put on publicdisplay and always remain deep in the shadows. The operational headquarters ofthe Blueprint is in Europe in places like Rome and ‘The City’ of London, Berlin,Paris and Brussels. Australia is also right up there and so, of course, is theUnited States, but not as much as you would think given its apparent superpowerstatus. Most of the bullets may be shot by America, but most of the guns areloaded and directed in Europe (Rothschild) and Israel (Rothschild). America wasset up from the start by the Archon families who invaded that land to be in manyways a diversion of global attention from where the real power lies. America isclearly the centre of global power, everyone knows that, right? Britain? Oh, nothat’s just a faded empire. Rome? Oh, no, that’s the same. Well, actually theyare not faded empires at all. They are key centres of power and manipulation ofa hidden global empire. Why does a ‘faded empire’ like Britain have a permanentplace on the United Nations Security Council to decide who is bombed and whoisn’t? Because it is has been a centre of Archon bloodline power for centuries.When I speak of London, Rome, Berlin, Paris and Brussels, I am not referring tothe governments of those places and countries. I mean the major centres atoperation level of the global secret society network which operates within everycountry and almost every community. Governments are merely stooges and gofersfor this network with here-today-gone-tomorrow politicians overwhelminglyignorant of the forces at work in the shadows. Secret societies are structuredas pyramids with most of members or initiates in the lower levels of ‘degree’(the degree of awareness of what they are part of). To progress up the pyramid,or degrees, they have to be selected by those above them in the pyramid (Fig313). This is how the knowledge is compartmentalised and given only to thechosen. Even the great majority of those who think they are at the official peakof a secret society, like the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry,have no idea that the major secret societies feed carefully chosen initiatesinto a higher pyramid which is almost entirely peopled by Archon bloodlines andtheir most trusted (or controlled) agents and gofers (Fig 314). Only a fewmembers of secret societies know that this upper pyramid (often referred to asthe ‘Illuminati’) exists, but this is where the real power lies and thosedegrees are also strictly compartmentalised with the very highest levelsoccupied only by Archon families. These pyramid structures are founded on fearand super-secrecy at all levels. Each level dictates to the one below and thoseat the top of the bloodline pyramid, and all those below who are aware of theirtrue masters, are terrified of the Archons and the one they worship as theirtrue god, the Demiurge, or the Devil/Satan/Lucifer. Foster Bailey (1888-1977)was a Freemason, the National Secretary of Madame Blavatsky’s TheosophicalSociety, and co-founder of the Lucis [Lucifer] Trust which promoted the works ofhis wife, the occultist Alice Bailey. He wrote:[../Images/00380.jpg]Figure 312: The Spider Clan.[../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 313: Secret societies are strictly compartmentalised in terms ofknowledge at each level or degree.[../Images/00555.jpg]Figure 314: Secret societies feed carefully chosen initiates into thesuper-secret Archon pyramid known to only the most trusted few.> Little as it may be realised by the unthinking Mason who is interested only in> the outer aspects of the Craft work, the whole fabric of Masonry may be> regarded as an externalisation of that inner spiritual group whose members,> down the ages, have been the Custodians of the Plan, and as Those to Whom has> been committed the working out of the will of God [the Demiurge] for the race> of men.> They can be known ... as the Masters of the Wisdom for They are skilled in the> divine ways and have mastered the arts and sciences which Their fellowmen have> yet to master. They are the Dispensers of Light and to Them has been given, by> virtue of Their achievement, the privilege and the authority to pronounce the> great Masonic formula: ‘Let there be light’ and to evoke the response: ‘And> there was LIGHT’.I have already mentioned that their definition of ‘Light’ is the Matrix. Theglobal secret society structure operates within the overall global Blueprint –the symbolic ‘transnational corporation’. This can be portrayed as a pyramidagain, or as a spider’s web. The few at the top know what the organisation’sreal motives are, what it is trying to achieve and the other groupings to whichit is connected; but the ‘masses’ that serve the pyramids do not. This samestructure applies to governments, universities, schools, corporations, media,banks – everything. These various institutions and sections of society arethemselves ultimately grouped together in bigger pyramids in a structure thatcan be likened to Russian dolls with pyramids inside bigger pyramids andeventually all are encompassed within the biggest or global pyramid. Thesepyramids of government, banking, corporations, military, ‘education’, ‘science’,media, religion, Intelligence agencies and so on all fuse together at the peakof the all-encompassing global pyramid – the biggest ‘doll’ – where sit theArchon bloodline families and their Archon masters dictating a common policy ofconstant centralisation and advancement of human control through all the variouspyramids (Fig 315). It doesn’t matter to them when banks, governments etc., comeand go, because they own the game. If you own the Olympic Games it doesn’tmatter who wins or loses the 100 metres final or the long jump, because you ownthe games and so you win whatever. The direction, needs and wants of the globalconspiracy come down from the Demiurge-Archons through their bloodlines at thetop of the biggest ‘human’ pyramid and down into all the other pyramids thatdirect human society (Fig 316). I would say that 95 percent of humanity has noclue that this structure exists or who the ultimate controllers are; and yet itis impacting so powerfully and constantly on their choices, perceptions anddaily life. This is what that document I mentioned earlier means when itdescribes ‘silent weapons for quiet wars’.[../Images/00436.jpg]Figure 315: The compartmentalised structure of pyramids-within-pyramids that wecall human society.[../Images/00353.jpg]Figure 316: The human and hybrid levels of the Control System answer to theArchontic structure in another reality.Rhodes to ruinThere are also particular groupings within the overall network and one which isimportant to mention is centred on a secret society based in London called theRound Table which was funded into existence by the Archon Rothschilds in thelate 19th century. The first head of the Round Table was Cecil Rhodes whomercilessly plundered southern Africa for the Rothschilds and established thegold and diamond mines before his death in 1902. He established a fund in hiswill to sponsor selected young people to attend Oxford University, the centre ofthe bloodline network of ‘education’ manipulation. These became known as RhodesScholarships and among the many elite-serving recipients has been former USPresident Bill Clinton. The Round Table began to establish offshoot subsidiariesmainly in Britain and the United States but with global implications (Fig 317).These were: the Royal Institute of International Affairs (UK, 1920); the Councilon Foreign Relations (US, 1921); the United Nations (orchestrated into beingprimarily by the Council on Foreign Relations); the Bilderberg Group (Europe/USwith a global impact, 1954); the Club of Rome (specifically created to exploitthe environment to justify the bloodline agenda, as with the lie about‘humancaused climate change’, 1968); and the Trilateral Commission(US/Europe/Japan with a global impact, 1973). The Rothschilds are the hiddenforce behind the Round Table network. The Rockefeller family, the subordinatecohorts of the Rothschilds, also have significant influence with regard to theBilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission. The last of these was co-founded by David Rockefeller and ZbigniewBrzezinski, a bigtime asset of the Archon Cabal and National Security Advisor toPresident Jimmy Carter. These Round Table offshoots operate mainly in the publicarena in terms of their official existence, except for the Bilderberg Groupwhich has sought to keep both itself and its famous attendees as hidden aspossible. The growth of the conspiracy research movement has brought Bilderbergfar more to public attention and I have been exposing it for the best part of 20years. How far we have come was highlighted at the Bilderberg meeting inWatford, England, in 2013 when thousands gathered in the grounds of the hotel toexpose its manipulation. But even those involved with Bilderberg and these otherRound Table groups are still overwhelmingly the oil rags of the conspiracy andnot the engineers. These groups are used to bring together in-it-formepoliticians, bankers, corporate leaders, military chiefs, ‘journalists’, andIntelligence personnel to agree ‘consensus’ policies across national borders.They provide the platform for dark-suited prostitutes and arse-lickers to meetfor their mutual benefit and to serve the interests of their ‘betters’. RoundTable groups are so-called ‘think-tanks’. Watch all ‘think-tanks’ very closelybecause they are a major vehicle for manipulating government policy andinstigating change in society that is not at all good for the population. Put‘Bilderberg attendees’ into a search engine and, thanks to leaked information,you’ll be able to see who has attended over the years. The Round Table and itsnetwork, including the Bilderberg Group, are exposed at length in ... And theTruth Shall Set You Free.[../Images/00393.jpg]Figure 317: The Round Table network.Zion’s KingdomThe global Archon networks of bloodline families, their agents and groupings arebasically one gigantic interlocking secret society with a stream of constituentparts that have different names and faces but answer to the same master. TheRoman Church is one major player, for example, and so is Zionism; or RothschildZionism as I call it in order to constantly underpin who created and controlsthis incredibly significant contributor to Archontic manipulation of humansociety. I have once again exposed the true background and nature of RothschildZionism in great detail in other books and I am not going to repeat everythinghere except to say the following. Zionism was not established for the benefit ofJewish people in general but to use them as a front to hide its real role as amajor secret society within the global Archontic web. Zionism was created by theRothschilds in Europe with its public face demanding a homeland for Jews in whatwas Arab Palestine; but Zionism was never about the best interests of Jews – howcould it be when Rothschild Zionist assets were behind the rise of Hitler andthe Nazis which led large numbers of Jews to head for Israel after the war whenthis would not have happened without the Nazis doing what they did. There hadbeen so much resistance and opposition from German Jews to the Zionist plan tomove them to Palestine that the first Zionist Congress in 1897 had to berelocated from Munich to Basel, Switzerland. Then came the Nazis and theirconcentration camps and millions of Jews relocated to Palestine and the UnitedStates. Thanks to the Nazis the Rothschild Zionists got their way with theestablishment of the fake State of Israel. Coincidence? Not a chance. The Jewsthat bombed, terrorised and mass-murdered their way to military dominance overthe indigenous Palestinians claimed rights to that land because of Old Testamentbollocks written by who knows who, who knows when and in who knows whatcircumstances; but the truth is that they have no historic connections withthose lands. This has been confirmed by Jewish writers and historians, as I havealready outlined. They originate from Mesopotamia and Khazaria and not Israel.Jews returning to the Promised Land is just a fable concocted by the Rothschildsto scam the Jewish population as well as the rest of the world. There are threemain facets to Zionism with regard to Jewish people. Firstly, there aresignificant numbers of Jews who not only don’t support Zionism, but vehementlyoppose it (Fig 318). Nor do you have to be Jewish to be a Zionist because manyof its advocates are not, notably the Christian Zionists in the United Statesled by the professional arse-licker, John Hagee (Fig 319). To be a Zionist youonly have to support the goals and interests of Zionism (both very unpleasant).Secondly, there is the main body of Jews who support Zionism because they havebought the historical lies and are programmed by religious and political beliefto justify the grotesque daily atrocities against Palestinian people or closetheir eyes to them altogether. The third group consists of the Rothschilds andothers in the inner circle that know Zionism is just a cover story and theyoperate like initiates of a secret society, which is what Zionism is at itscore, to further the interests of the Archontic agenda (Fig 320). RothschildZionists control not only Israel, but also the United States, Britain, theEuropean Union, Australia, and on it goes. Once the State of Israel was bombedinto being in 1948 an army of Zionist assets were sent to the United States toproduce children that would be American citizens and able to infiltrate the USpolitical system – which they have. Rothschild Zionists control the White Houseand Capitol Hill via their own assets and through the predominant funding ofAmerican politicians (Fig 321). Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon who is stilllying in a coma after his stroke in 2006, told Foreign Minister Shimon Peresduring an argument over policy on October 3rd 2012:[../Images/00502.jpg]Figure 318: Not all Jews are Zionists and not all Zionists are Jews.[../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 319: John Hagee, arse-licker-in-chief of the Christian Zionists.[../Images/00154.jpg]Figure 320: Rothschild Zionism.[../Images/00035.jpg]Figure 321: Two parties but one master.[../Images/00504.jpg]Figure 322: The President of the United States with Barack Obama.> Every time we do something. You tell me Americans will do this and will do> that. I want to tell you something very clear: don’t worry about American> pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control America and the Americans> know it.Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said pretty much the same when he wassecretly filmed talking with an Israeli family (Fig 322). The film, which cameto light in 2010, shows Netanyahu boasting how he scuppered the peace processwith the Palestinians known as the Oslo Accords. These people don’t want peacewith the Palestinians; they only want to buy enough time for the Palestinians tobe destroyed. The world is watching daily genocide. The Rothschild ZionistAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) is one of the biggest and bestfunded political lobby groups in America and yet it represents the interests ofa foreign power. You cannot become US President unless you are acceptable toRothschild Zionism which is why you see candidates flying off to Israel to bephotographed in a skull cap at the Western ‘Wailing’ Wall in Jerusalem andmaking their ‘anything-you-want-you-can-have’ speeches at AIPAC gatherings (Fig323). It is very difficult to even win a seat in Congress if AIPAC and Zionismoppose you because of funding and the almost complete Rothschild Zionist controlof the major US print, radio and television media. The Zionist secret societyalso controls Hollywood, a prime Archontic vehicle for global perceptionprogramming; the banking and financial system; and the major corporations acrossa vast swathe of global society (Fig 324). The Rothschilds do this throughdirect control and by funding. Zionist assets were sent to the United Statesfrom Rothschild Germany in the 19th century and later to establish control ofAmerican and global banking with names like Goldman, Sachs, Lazard and Lehman.And it is no good whatsoever anyone screaming ‘anti-Semitism’ (which actuallymeans anti-Arab, ironically) because of what I am saying. These are factsclearly supported by the documentable evidence and accepted to be so innewspaper articles by Jewish writers. The ratio of Rothschild Zionists topositions of power in the United States is absolutely fantastic. Jews accountfor less than two percent of the American population and many of those will notbe Rothschild Zionists and yet they control politics; banking, including theprivately (Zionist)-owned US Central Bank, the Federal Reserve; Big Oil; BigBiotech; Big Pharma; Big Food; Big Media; Hollywood; and much of the Internetincluding Google, Yahoo, YouTube, eBay, Amazon, Wikipedia and major socialnetworking sites like Facebook, MySpace and Twitter. Google is especiallysignificant to the conspiracy with its dominant position in web activity and thetechnologies it is producing through its secret Google X laboratory. It is nocoincidence that Regina Dugan, director of the Pentagon’s research and developarm, the horrific Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), left tobecome an executive of Google. The Internet giant was founded by Lawrence‘Larry’ Page (Rothschild Zionist) and Sergey Brin (Rothschild Zionist) whosefamily emigrated from the Soviet Union. Page became Google chief executive in2011 replacing Eric Schmidt (Rothschild Zionist), a campaign advisor and majordonor to Barack Obama. Schmidt, now Google’s executive chairman, has been aregular attendee of the Bilderberg Group which has been getting very close tothe annual Google Zeitgeist (‘Spirit of the Times’) conference. This bringstogether political leaders, the world’s ‘top intellectuals’, celebrities andwhat can be collectively called ‘opinion formers’. Program the ‘opinion formers’and they will inform the public of your desired opinion. The RothschildZionist-controlled Bilderberg meeting in Britain in June, 2013 at the secludedGrove Hotel near Watford, north of London, followed within days the RothschildZionist-controlled Google Zeitgeist event at the same hotel.[../Images/00130.jpg]Figure 323: Ritual prostitution.[../Images/00243.jpg]Figure 324: Rothschild Zionism owns the global propaganda and programmingmachine that we call Hollywood.Rothschild Zionists controlled the Pentagon at the time of 9/11 and theRothschild Zionist-orchestrated invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq throughDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz andPentagon Comptroller, Dov Zakheim, among many others. The number of RothschildZionists involved in the Archon bloodline-engineered 9/11 before, during andafter the event is staggering and demolishes any credible claim for this to bemere statistical chance (all this is laid out in detail in Human Race Get OffYour Knees). The United States government has armed Israel with state-of-the-arttechnology to such an extent that this sliver of land with a population of lessthan eight million has one of the best equipped military machines on the planet– including an arsenal of nuclear weapons. No matter how much the most basicpayments to the poor and destitute in America are cut and deleted because of the‘economic crisis’ the billions handed over by the US to Israel every year arenever reduced. The reason for this and the military technology and silence aboutIsrael’s nuclear weapons which they will not allow to be inspected is thatRothschild Zionists control the United States and they control Israel. One assetof the Rothschilds is simply handing money, weaponry and diplomatic support toanother. The same is true of Rothschild Britain where the ‘Friends of Israel’organisation is a major source of Rothschild Zionist manipulation within all themajor political parties and funding is another source as always on the basisthat he who pays the piper calls the tune. Both the Conservative and LabourParties at the time of writing are led by Rothschild Zionists in the form ofPrime Minister David Cameron and Opposition leader Ed Miliband when the Jewishpopulation of the UK is around 290,000 – less than one percent of the nationalpopulation of some 63 million. Rothschild Zionists have virtually completecontrol of the Canadian and Australian governments and political systems whenJews account for only 1.11 and 0.5 percent of their populations. Jews make uponly 0.17 percent of the New Zealand population and yet have the current PrimeMinister, John Key, leading the country. The same Rothschild Zionist influencecan be seen in countries right across Europe – East as well as West. Jewsaccount for just 0.2 percent of the world population but their influence on thelives of everyone on the planet is fundamental. When you think that of this 0.2percent many will not be Rothschild Zionists and many of those who are will notbe active or directly involved, you are looking at the most extraordinaryinfluence on world affairs by tiny group of people who are the in-the-loopoperatives in pursuit of the Rothschild Zionist Archontic agenda. How can so fewhave so much influence and control? They have limitless money; they areincredibly well organised; they are absolutely ruthless, not least with eachother if they don’t perform their given tasks; and they have an enforcement arm,publicly-known as the Israeli Military Intelligence operation, Mossad, whichmakes undiluted evil look innocuous by comparison. Mossad does not serve Israeliinterests primarily, but those of the Rothschilds and the Archontic conspiracy.‘Pity what happened to Kennedy wasn’t it, Mr President? Best do what we say,then, don’t you think? You know it makes sense.’Weaponised defamationRothschild Zionists protect themselves from exposure through a network oforganisations specifically designed to target anyone documenting these facts asan ‘anti-Semite’. These include the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), whichironically sets out to defame its targets; B’nai B’rith or ‘Sons of theCovenant’ (established by Jews from Rothschild Germany who all emigrated toAmerica in the same period in the 19th century – just like the major GermanZionist banking families); the Simon Wiesenthal Center (named after a ‘Nazihunting’ fraud); the Southern ‘Poverty’ Law Center (which has massive assets);the Board of Deputies of British Jews and many, many others. The Rothschildshave been superbly served by the Robot Radical political ‘Left’ in their questto label any researcher with the guts to expose their crimes against humanity asan ‘anti-Semite’. This is just calculated abuse to silence those who seek touncover the truth behind unspeakable world events and, with the usual irony(inversion), the very people behind the global injustices that the Left claim tocare so much about. Shulamit Aloni, a former Israeli minister and peaceactivist, was asked on American alternative television about the accusations ofanti-Semitism against all those who challenge the violence and fascism ofIsrael. She said:> It’s a trick. We always use it. When from Europe someone is criticising Israel> then we bring up the Holocaust. When people in this country are criticising> Israel then they are anti-Semitic. The organisation is strong and has a lot of> money and the ties between Jews and America – the Jewish establishment – they> are strong in this country, they have power ... they are talented people and> they have power, money, media and other things, and their attitude is Israel,> my country, right or wrong ...> ... They are not ready to hear criticism, and it is very easy to blame people> who criticise certain acts of the Israeli government as anti-Semitic and to> bring out the Holocaust and the suffering of the Jewish people, and that> justifies everything we do to the Palestinians.All that is true, but the anti-Semite scam is more than that. It is to blockexposure of the real agenda of the Rothschilds, who have every bit as muchcontempt for the mass of the Jewish people as they have for the rest of theglobal population. Most people keep quiet for fear of attacks from these peopleand their mindless assets on the moronic political ‘Left’ (see also moronicpolitical ‘Right’). But I won’t stay quiet. I say fuck ‘em, personally. I wantthe truth, not a statue. A Jewish chap with a mind-wide-shut mentality attendeda presentation I did in Hawaii in 2012 (an event organised by a Jewish man whosefather suffered in the Nazi concentration camps). His intention was not tolisten, but merely to disrupt. He began shouting out when I put a graphic on thescreen with six organisations in a circle connected by lines. His problem wasthat the lines (coincidentally) formed a six-pointed star simply because therewere six organisations in the network that I was exposing. Had there been sevenit would have been a seven-pointed star. These people see ‘anti-Semitism’, asthey so inaccurately call it, everywhere. This bloke was apoplectic by the timeI reached the sections of the talk where I said that the six-pointed star, orStar of David, was an ancient symbol for Saturn and I highlighted the dailygenocide inflicted upon helpless Palestinians by the armed-to-the-teeth Israeligovernment. He eventually rushed forward to attack me and was stopped by membersof the audience in the front row as he tried to mount the stage. He was stillgiven the opportunity to stay and listen if he didn’t disrupt, but he refused togive that assurance. Walls are easier to converse with than people with thatlevel of programming. Even worse, his bricks-and-mortar mind was judgingeverything from a belief system that is nothing more than a cut-and-paste fromthe Rothschild scam-book. I am, in effect, banned from speaking in ‘free’ Canadabecause of Rothschild Zionists (around one percent of the Canadian population)and the Australian government always takes its time giving me permission toenter the country for public events but has yet to find a good reason to ban methat will not open the Australian tyranny to public exposure. ‘Hate laws’ arebeing passed around the world to stop Rothschild Zionist manipulation beingdiscussed and in at least some cases even telling the provable truth is nodefence. American campuses and academics – even Jewish ones like the greatNorman Finkelstein – are being constantly targeted with screams of anti-Semitismwhenever the lethal actions of Israel are challenged or questioned. A resolutionin the California Assembly that equated student activism against Israel’s evilabuse of the Palestinians with anti-Semitism was passed without even debate. Yetsome of the students protesting against Israel are Jewish. Calling Israel anapartheid state when it clearly is under any definition of apartheid is nowbranded ‘anti-Semitic discourse’ even if you are a Jewish student. I mean, theyare even introducing segregated buses now in Israel. But politicians areterrified of saying or doing anything that the Rothschild Zionism lobby wouldn’tlike because of the consequences for funding and media coverage or funding andpromoting an opponent at the next election. Nothing encapsulated the situationmore profoundly than the pathetic sight in 2011of the political prostitutes ofboth houses of Congress giving Israel Prime Minister and Rothschild hatchet man,Benjamin Netanyahu, 29 standing ovations in a speech of roughly 50 minutes.Their arses must have been sore from constantly bouncing on the chair. Netanyahustood before them as leader of a country which is home to just 0.001 percent ofthe global population and for those who don’t know the background the receptionfor Netanyahu should make no sense; but when you know that they own Americanpolitics through money, media and Intelligence networks which make it theirbusiness to know everything about political figures you can see that Americanpoliticians dare not upset the hand that feeds them and the media andIntelligence sources that could destroy them (Fig 325). Rothschild Zionism is afundamentally important asset of the Archon bloodline network and its global‘blueprint’ structure of manipulation. You will find the detailed background toall that I have outlined here and so much more in books such as ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free, The David Icke Guide To The Global Conspiracy, HumanRace Get Off Your Knees and Remember Who You Are.[../Images/00345.jpg]Figure 325: Land of the Free.Archon hierarchyThe Archons have structured human society to be a mirror of their ownhierarchical organisation. Royalty and the aristocracy are the most obviousexample with all their titles, rituals and clothing maintained in accordancewith strict hierarchical order and precedence, but it applies to the entireglobal structure with Satanism, religion, Rothschild Zionism and all the otherstrands in the web and an obsession with hierarchy and ritual is a trait of thereptilian brain and reptilian (Archon) genetics in general. This is an articleexplaining who is where on the genetic ladder within the British royal hierarchybefore the marriage of William to Kate Middleton:> One of the most complicated aspects of court life is precedence. The> Sovereign’s precedence is absolute, and The Sovereign can determine where on> the scale everyone else falls. Officially The Sovereign is at the top of the> scale followed by The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Including male adults> of the royal family only, His Royal Highness is followed by The Prince of> Wales, The Sovereign’s two younger sons (The Duke of York and The Earl of> Wessex), The Sovereign’s grandsons of male descent (Prince William and Prince> Henry), The Sovereign’s cousins (The Duke of Gloucester, The Duke of Kent, and> Prince Michael of Kent), eldest sons of Dukes of The Blood Royal (Earl of> Ulster and Earl of St Andrews), and younger sons of Dukes of The Blood Royal> (Lord Nicholas Windsor and Lord Frederick Windsor).> Among the female members of the royal family, precedence is an important part> of life. The Queen is followed by The Duchess of Cornwall and The Countess of> Wessex in official precedence. However, it has been claimed that for court> functions Her Majesty has decreed that The Princess Royal and Princess> Alexandra should be of higher precedence by right of their being Princesses of> The Blood Royal. I have included here the official order of precedence for> female adult members of the royal family: The Queen, The Duchess of Cornwall,> The Countess of Wessex, The Princess Royal, Princess Beatrice, Princess> Eugenie, The Duchess of Gloucester, The Duchess of Kent, Princess Michael of> Kent, Princess Alexandra The Hon. Lady Ogilvy, Miss Zara Phillips (by> courtesy), Countess of Ulster, The Lady Davina Lewis, The Lady Rose Gilman,> Countess of St Andrews, The Lady Nicholas Windsor, The Lady Helen Taylor, The> Lady Gabriella Windsor, Mrs James Ogilvy, Miss Marina Ogilvy.Got all that? This is classic reptilian-brain hierarchy and the Archon divisionof society on the grounds of genetics which was the inspiration for the Indiancaste system and human society in general. Ant colonies have a hierarchicaldivision between royalty and workers and so do humans. We just have more levelsof division with royalty, aristocracy, billionaire bankers and business people(bosses) and the religious and political elite exploiting the slavery of theworkers who serve their interests and pay the taxation to fund those above themin the genetic and financial hierarchy (or house of cards as it would be ifhumanity would only wake up). The Archon bloodlines are not confined to thesurviving royal and aristocratic families. They run throughout the upperechelons of the pyramid in politics, banking, commerce, media, military and theother institutions of control and manipulation. This is why political, bankingand business dynasties interbreed through arranged marriages as much as royaltydoes. Human society is also a parasitical hierarchy, as you would expect whenthose directing it are professional parasites. The Demiurge parasitizes off theArchons; the Archons and their bloodlines parasitize off humanity; so manyhumans parasitize off each other and it goes right down to the parasites thatparasitize off the human body. Humans parasites are playing out the Archonparasite programs. You could hardly have a better example of the parasitesociety than banking where they lend you money that doesn’t exist (credit) andcharge you interest on it. Taxation was introduced so the system couldparasitize off the labour and creativity of the population for the benefit ofthe Archontic few. Look at how the Gnostics described the Demiurge-Archonmentality and you are looking at human society. They not only gave us theirmind; they gave us their societal structure of hierarchal division. I willreturn to the structure of systematic manipulation in politics, finance andmedia, and so on, but first I want to expose in more detail theArchontic-Satanic networks upon which it is all founded."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00036.jpg]Archon SatanismHe who does not oppose evil ... commands it to be done.Leonardo da VinciSatanism, or more accurately Saturn-ism, is not a few half-pissed goons wearinghoods and gowns doing silly rituals to worship some illusory evil force. Yes,there will be some like that, though the evil force is not illusory; but theyare not in the same league as the heartless, soulless core of the officialglobal Archontic-Saturn-ic network.Satanism is not driven and directed by the small fry who (mis)perform rituals intheir front room with candles and inverted pentagrams. These people do exist andtheir energy field will be possessed by the comparatively small-fry malevolencethat they invoke. But real Satanism which dictates world events is the fiefdomof the rich and famous – royalty, aristocracy, politicians, bankers, leadingbusiness people, media owners, executives and ‘stars’ in the entertainmentindustry, lawyers, doctors and others perceived as the very upright pillars ofsociety. They are the El-lite who knowingly serve and worship theDemiurge-Archons (Fig 326). A Jewish woman called Vicki Polin appeared on theOprah Winfrey Show in 1989 to describe how she was brought up in a Satanicfamily in Chicago and forced to witness and participate in human and animalsacrifice. She said that her parents had an extensive family tree and, likeSatanists in general, they ‘keep track of who’s been involved and who hasn’tbeen involved, and it’s gone back to like 1700’. This ‘keeping track’ meansfollowing the bloodline to know who has it and who doesn’t. Some people refer tothe hybrid bloodlines as the ‘satanic bloodlines’ and this is fair because somany of them are practicing Satanists for reasons that will become clear.Satanism is dominated by the Archon bloodline hybrids and their offshoots whoare far more genetically/vibrationally-compatible for possession by their hiddengods than are the rest of the population. They carefully track the bloodline tosee who would be most possessable and many are brought into the fold with noidea at first of their genetic significance. Royal families, aristocracy and theupper echelons of the bloodline are well aware of this, however, and they are‘up there’ because they are the most easily and powerfully possessed. Theymaintain strict and unwavering interbreeding regimes to keep the bloodline‘pure’ and maximally possessable – thus there is no coincidence in the satanicroyal family of Britain being genetically related to Vlad the Impaler, theinspiration for Dracula, and one of the most infamous blood-drinking humansacrificers, or vampires, in history. The Archons are energetic beings, orinformation constructs, and they attach to humans and their hybrids via theelectromagnetic auric field. Once in place they can influence or even completelydictate the person’s thoughts and emotions. Vicki Polin described to OprahWinfrey the systematic schizophrenia of Satanists which allows them to be onepersonality in the public eye and quite another in private. She said this abouther mother:[../Images/00396.jpg]Figure 326: Many masks but one face.> She lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. She’s on the human relations> commission of the town that she lives in, and she’s an upstanding citizen.> Nobody would suspect her. Nobody would suspect anybody involved in it. There’s> police officers involved in it. There’s, you know, doctors, lawyers, Indian> chiefs involved in it ... I mean, to the outside world, everything we did was> proper and right, and then there were the nights that things changed, that> things just got turned around. What was wrong was right, and what was right> was wrong.I call this a state of systematic schizophrenia because the Satanists controlit, or their possessing entities do. The entities can withdraw when the peoplehave to appear normal and like everyone else – ‘Oh, I met that man you said wasa Satanist and he was so pleasant and nice.’ But whenever it is necessary toimpose their will on the possessed person’s perceptions and behaviour,especially during rituals, the entities take control and the possessed Satanistgoes through a personality ‘shapeshift’. True Satanists, as opposed to dabblers,willingly allow this to happen and even sign a contract in their own blood tothis effect. The blood and the contract create an energetic attachment betweenpossessor and possessed. The Satanic hierarchy in this reality is dictated bythe power and status of the possessing entity and entities and, in this way, thesatanic hierarchy of Demiurge-Archon-Reptilians, or Satan-Demons, becomes the‘human’ hierarchy of power on Earth. I don’t mean the hierarchy that we see ofroyalty, presidents, prime ministers and the like. I mean the hidden hierarchyfor whom presidents and prime ministers are mere page boys andladies-in-waiting. The surviving official royal families and their aristocracyare the most public face of this hidden power structure, but there are those inthe hierarchy higher than them whom people never see. David Berkowitz, the ‘Sonof Sam’ serial killer in New York in the 1970s, said that he had carried out thekillings for the satanic coven of which he was a member. He said incorrespondence with a church minister that genuine Satanists were not ‘ignorantpeasants or semi-literate natives’ but rather their ranks were filled with‘doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and basically highly responsible citizens’. Hesaid that they were not a careless group that were apt to make mistakes, butthey were secretive and ‘bonded together by a common need and desire to mete outhavoc on society’. He quoted the British master Satanist Aleister Crowley(1875-1947) as saying: ‘I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anythingbad.’Precisely. ‘Anything bad’ means multiple distortions of human society that focuslow-vibrational attention on the lower emotional and sexual chakras. This is onemajor reason why the theme of sex is such a part of satanic ritual and the humansociety that the Archon Satanists so influence.Satan’s WorldWars, famine, death and suffering in all their manipulated forms are masssatanic rituals designed to produce death and emotional trauma for both victimsand observers – the energy on which the Archons feed. Human and animal sacrificeritual is specifically structured to produce the energy of terror in the victimfor the hidden entities to absorb (Fig 327). The energy that a sacrificedelivers resonates within the frequency band of the Archons. We can’t see thisenergy; we can only see its ‘physical’ manifestation in people’s response tofear and terror. But the Archons are in sync with the energy in this fear/terrorfrequency band and they can absorb it and feed off it. Meanwhile, the Satanistsperforming the ritual within visible light drink the blood and eat the flesh ofthe victims (who are often children, for reasons that I will explain). A commontheme in ancient accounts of the serpent gods throughout the world is that theydemanded human sacrifice. Credo Mutwa told me that, according to legend, it wasthe Chitauri that instigated cannibalism – as they instigated religion ingeneral. There was no religion before the predators imposed themselves on humansociety. This is the background to why the ancients made ‘sacrifices to thegods’ to ‘appease the gods’. They were making a sacrifice of human and animalenergy and the theme of sacrificing ‘young virgins’ to the gods was code forchildren. Remember what Cathy O’Brien said she was told by Mexico’s President dela Madrid: ‘The Mayan pyramids, their advanced astronomical technology,including sacrifice of virgins, was supposedly inspired by the lizard aliens.’The bloodlines did this openly for thousands of years, but when it becameunacceptable to the population they went underground into secret satanicnetworks and they have continued to perform these rituals on an extraordinaryscale in line with a strictly-observed satanic ritual calendar. This dictatesthe time and type of ritual in accord with the astronomical-astrologicalpositions of the planets and stars. They know how fundamentally this influencesthe changing state of the global energy field which satanic ritual is designedto manipulate. If you type ‘satanic ritual calendar’ into a search engine youwill see the dates and the nature of the corresponding rituals. The two key onesare Walpurgis Night, or Beltane, from April 29th/30th through to May 1st; and,of course, Halloween, or All Hallow’s Eve, on October 31st. The dates arereversed in the southern hemisphere. There has been an enormous effort in recenttimes to encourage people, especially children, to become involved in theHalloween ritual by turning the day into a form of Christmas (Saturnalia) withgifts, trick and treat and all that goes with it. A former occultist explainedthe origin of today’s Halloween ‘fun’:[../Images/00270.jpg]Figure 327: The force behind Satanism.> As darkness set in on October 31st, the clan of Druids would put on their> white robes and hoods. They would carry sickles [Saturn] and Celtic crosses> [Saturn] as they began a torchlight procession. At the beginning of the> procession, a male slave was killed and dragged by a rope fastened to his left> ankle. The Druids would walk until they came to a house or a village where> they shouted the equivalent of ‘trick or treat’. The treat was a slave girl or> any female to be given to the Druids.> If the people refused to [offer] a girl as a ‘treat’, blood was taken from the> dead slave and used to draw a hexagram or six-pointed star [Saturn] on the> door or wall of the village. Spirits of the ‘horned hunter of the night’> [Saturn] were invoked by the Druids to kill someone in that house or village> by fear that night.> If the house or village gave a girl as a ‘treat’, the Druids put a pumpkin> with a face carved in it in front of the door or gate of that place. Inside> the pumpkin was a candle made of human tallow to keep evil spirits away. Thus,> the Jack-O-Lantern was and is a sign that you have cooperated with Satan [the> Demiurge-Archons].> The treats or female victims were taken to Stonehenge where they were raped> and killed and then sacrificed on the sacred bonefire until only glowing> embers were left. The ‘bonefire’ is the origin of the modern day bonfire. As a> matter of luck for winter survival, all villagers were expected to use the> glowing embers of the bonefire to light their hearths.[../Images/00223.jpg]Figure 328: Halloween is very different to the modern public image.Energy flows where attention goes and the conspiracy is constantly seeking todirect the focus of human attention on its symbols and rituals and by attractingthe attention of children onto the Halloween ritual they are making an energeticconnection (Fig 328). The same applies to the television series and movies thatglorify vampires and even get people swooning over them because they are so‘sexy’ – Twilight comes immediately to mind. There have been hundreds of filmswith vampires as the theme. It is all preparation to accept the hidden withinthe realm of the seen and to make an energetic connection. So are the HarryPotter books and films which are preparing young people to accept occult ‘magic’and ‘special’ bloodlines as part of their society – Harry Potter and theHalf-Blood Prince, etc. Some very popular books and cartoons that I’ve seen forreally young children involve the theme of shapeshifting and bloodline hybrids.You can see this in the Ben 10 Alien Force series of ‘graphic novels’ for smallchildren which include ‘HighBreeds’, DNAliens, dragons, shapeshifting and asecret organisation ‘originally formed in the Middle Ages’ called the ‘ForeverKnights’ who ‘trade in illegal alien technology’. We are talking five-year-oldsreading and watching this stuff full of symbolism, violence and perceptionprogramming via the subconscious.Why Satanism?Satanism has a number of interconnected goals. These include: (1) To generateenergy for the Archons, as in making sacrifices to the gods; (2) To interactwith the Archons by creating energetic fields in the most powerful rituals thatallow them to slip through temporarily into visible light; (3) To covertlyperpetuate the bloodlines through Satanists impregnating each other, and thoughwomen held in captivity to produce children which are brought up under differentfamily names to keep their famous fathers hidden from public view; (4) To encodelow-vibrational frequencies, codes and perception-programs into the Earth’senergy field by performing rituals on major points and vortexes on themeridian/ley line grid through which their distortions are circulated across theentire grid. Everything they do is about distortion and inversion for all thereasons that I have described. I have talked to former Satanists and thoseforced to take part in their rituals and they tell the same story. Satanicrituals today are merely repeating those performed in antiquity by theBabylonians, Druids and their like around the world. This is why: the ritualsare designed, in part, to combine the frequencies of sound (chanting); colour(mainly black and red because of their energetic/frequency effect); and symbolswhich are information and frequency fields that connect the ritual with theArchontic-Saturnic realms. This combination creates a stepping-stone energyfield that opens an energetic doorway for the Archons to appear to human sight.When rituals are being performed in the human realm they are being mirrored inthe Archontic realm and there is energetic interaction between the two throughthese ‘stepping-stone’ energy fields. I have spoken with former Satanists andforced ‘Satanists’ who have witnessed the manifestation in rituals ofArchontic-demonic entities. They say that an important part of creating this‘doorway’ is the classic symbol of Satanism, the inverted (of course) pentagramwhich is often portrayed within a circle (Fig 329). If you could see theinverted pentagram on a waveform level you would see an information field thatgenerates a channel through which entities can pass through into this reality.It takes an enormous amount of energy to do this and they can’t stay for long,but it is done at major rituals. Those who have experienced this tell me thatthe circle around the pentagram is there to generate a wall of energy which theentities cannot penetrate because the participants are themselves in terror ofthem. Everything is based on a hierarchy of fear. Warlocks to the lot of them, Isay. Symbols are holographic information fields – the language of imagesunderstood by initiates of Satanism and the highest initiates of the secretsociety network. Satanists use particular symbols because they generateparticular energy frequencies and not only in closed rituals either. Satanicsymbols are placed throughout society in the form of building placements, designand decoration, monuments and memorials, statues, religious symbols and thelike. They then synchronise the collective field with those frequencies. If theysymbolise the Demiurge-Archons and the Saturn Matrix then they will create achannel through which energy can be trawled from humans whose attention has beenmanipulated into that frequency band. Information (programmed perceptions) canalso come the other way and instigate a form of perception possession. Churchesand religious symbols of deities are doing exactly this.[../Images/00319.jpg]Figure 329: The classic symbol of Satanism.Alright, Lil?Reptilian symbolism is never far away in Satanism. One of the leading satanicdeities is the goddess known as Lilith. Versions of the story of the Garden ofEden depict Lilith as ‘Adam’s first wife’ and the mother of Cain. She wassymbolised as the snake that tempted Eve and portrayed as half-human,half-serpent (Fig 330). Lilith was associated with the sons of Anu, or Anunnaki,and with Samael, an (Archontic) demon ‘angel’ who, in Hebrew lore, is said to bethe serpent that impregnated Eve to give birth to Cain. Descriptions of Caininclude that he did not have a human face and was like the ‘heavenly beings’,not the ‘earthly beings’. He was also described as a ‘child of the Lord’(Demiurge/Saturn). The brothers Cain and Abel are the sons of Adam and Eve inthe Bible and also mentioned in a similar context in the Koran. We are told thatCain was a pretty evil chap and killed Abel. Cain is said to be the first humanto be born and Abel the first to die. This is the symbolic story of the birth ofthe human hybrids and the same theme can be found across the cultures. Lilithhas the perfect backstory for Satanists. Her name translates as ‘femalenight-being/demon’ and her colour is red. She is portrayed as the mother of thefirst vampires and widely associated with stealing and killing children. She issaid in some traditions to have forced herself upon Adam and bore him manydemons and spirits that were called ‘the plagues of humankind’. Arch SatanistAleister Crowley chose Lilith for the middle name of his first child and hewould never do that unless it had occult significance. Lilith is described as aconsort of Lucifer, the ‘light bringer’ and this is another version of theLilith-Samael story. Lilith and Lucifer are said to combine in the androgynousfigure of ‘Baphomet’, or the ‘Goat of Mendes’, a symbol of Saturn worshipped bythe Archontic Knights Templar. Lilith is also ‘Babalon’, ‘the Scarlet Woman’,‘Great Mother’, ‘Babylon the Great’, ‘Mother of Harlots’, ‘the Whore ofBabylon’, and ‘the Mother of Abominations’ described in Crowley’s The Book ofthe Law. Yet another version of Lilith is Semiramis, or Ishtar, the goddessunder many names who became the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour (Figs331). The French sculptor and Freemason Frederic Bartholdi designed the Statueof Liberty and he and his Freemason colleagues in Paris named her after thegoddess Libertas, a Roman version of Semiramis/Ishtar. The Goddess Columbia inthe District of Columbia (Washington DC) and the Goddess Freedom (inversion) onthe dome of the Capitol Building are the same symbolism. Lilith gave her name tothe Lily and this became a common symbol used by the Archon bloodlines, secretsocieties and Satanism. The lily is the inspiration for the symbol of royaltyknown as the fleur-de-lis and most famously used by the House of Windsor (Fig332). The fleurde-lis is a feature of the Spanish monarchy, the Grand Duke ofLuxembourg, French royal houses and the emblems and heraldry of the aristocracyall over Europe. The symbol is also on a gate at the White House. Lilith isanother deity symbolised as an owl and could be jointly associated with the40-foot stone owl at Bohemian Grove in the same way that ‘she’ and Lucifer aresupposed to combine as Baphomet. Lilith is also Hecate, the Greek goddess of theMoon, fire, light, black magic, witchcraft, necromancy, sorcery andentrance-ways. Hecate was also said to be accompanied on her travels by an owls.Hecate is the goddess of the crossroads, depicted with three faces as the‘goddess of the three paths’ (also the Roman goddess ‘Trivia’). She is a majorgoddess of Satanism and she is called ‘the goddess of the night’. There is asatanic group in England that calls itself the ‘Friends of Hecate’. You mightrecognise one of the depictions of the satanic goddess, Hecate (Fig 333). Ifnot, maybe the other picture will help with the Saturn luminous crescent and hertorch as the goddess of fire in the company of snakes and dogs (Fig 334). No?Try the third one then (Fig 335).[../Images/00249.jpg]Figure 329: The satanic goddess Lilith.[../Images/00222.jpg]Figure 331: Semiramis/Ishtar is the Statue of Liberty (inversion).[../Images/00152.jpg]Figure 332: The fleur-de-lis.[../Images/00541.jpg]Figure 333: Guess who?.[../Images/00512.jpg]Figure 334: Guess who?.[../Images/00305.jpg]Figure 335: It’s the symbol of ‘freedom’.Satan’s offspringSatanism is a means to perpetuate the bloodline and women held in captivity arealso used to produce foetuses commonly used in rituals. The women chosen to givebirth to children of the bloodline, either through sex or technologicalimpregnation, are carefully chosen because the bloodline program is carried bythe female, or the mitochondrial DNA. You see this in some faiths and religions.You are, for example, only considered Jewish by the extreme end of the Jewishfaith if your mother is Jewish and not if only your father is. Judaism’s law ofmatrilineal descent decrees that Jewish identity is passed on only by themother. One explanation says: ‘If the mother is not Jewish but the father is,his Jewish soul will not be extended to the child.’ The middle-ground of Judaismdoes not accept this, but the crazies do. The Archon bloodlines know this istrue for their program because of the way their genetics were specificallydesigned. The Archons know that the human body is a biological computer whichcan be controlled through encoded software, and their hybrids have particular‘junk’ DNA software that deletes the capacity for empathy with their targets andmakes them worship and serve their masters as gods. This software code isquickly diluted and eventually erased by interbreeding with those who have thewider human software and there you have the reason for the thousands of years ofobsessive interbreeding between royal and aristocratic families and, morelatterly, by the major families of politics, banking, big business and mediasince most of the former royal and aristocratic bloodlines went underground andinto dark-suit disguise. Vicki Polin, who was born into a Jewish satanic family,explained on the Oprah Winfrey Show how women are kept in captivity to givebirth to babies and foetuses to be sacrificed and this is a theme that I cameacross long ago after speaking with former Satanists and the victims ofSatanism. These captive women are called ‘breeders’ and they give birth tochildren that officialdom has no idea exists. This means they can be sacrificedwithout them ever officially being alive and so no questions are asked aboutwhat happened to them. Vicki Polin said:> There were people who bred babies in our family. No-one would know about it. A> lot of people were overweight, so you couldn’t tell if they were pregnant or> not, or they would supposedly go away for a while and then come back ... There> would be rituals in which babies would be sacrificed ... When I was very> young, I was forced to participate in that – in which I had to sacrifice an> infant ...The impregnation of the leading Archon bloodlines is invariably done atcarefully-timed rituals and we saw this theme in the 1968 movie, Rosemary’sBaby, the work of big-time insider, Roman Polanski (Rothschild Zionist), who hasbeen on the run from the American authorities (the non-satanic ones) for havingsex with a minor. He was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 on the request ofAmerican law enforcement, but the Swiss refused to extradite him after acampaign of support that included Hollywood celebrities, European artists andpoliticians – most prominently the then French President Nicholas Sarkozy(Rothschild Zionist). Sarkozy even hand-delivered a letter from Polanski toBarack Obama. Polanski’s wife, the actress Sharon Tate, was ritually murdered in1969 by the crazed cult of the Archon bloodline mind controlled asset andSatanist, the phenomenally-possessed Charles Manson. Polanski was out of thecountry at the time. Tate was eight months pregnant and the sacrifice of apregnant women has particular significance to these demented and beyond insanepeople. The star of Rosemary’s Baby was Mia Farrow who played the part of anaïve and unknowing pawn in a plot by a satanic cult in New York to impregnateher to give birth to what turned out to be a non-human baby with reptilian eyes.Her screen husband, who played a struggling actor, agreed to be in on the plotin return for being given big Hollywood roles. All this is based on fact, asPolanski well knew. Rothschild Zionist created-and-controlled Hollywood is oneof the major vehicles for mass global perception programming and many of itsactors, actresses and ‘stars’ are either knowing assets of the agenda or, farmore often, those who are products of the government-military mind controlprogrammes that I have exposed in great detail in many other books, includingThe Biggest Secret. The same applies to many of the ‘stars’ of the musicindustry, too. Artists like Madonna, Lady Gaga, Beyonce and her bling-rapperhusband Jay-Z all profusely employ symbols of the Archon bloodlines and Satanismin their performances. Madonna also uses the bloodline mind-fuck technique ofcognitive dissonance in which you say or do two opposing things withoutacknowledging the blatant contradiction. She opened a world tour in Tel Aviv in2012 calling for world peace and then immediately pranced around with an AK-47 –the weapon-of-choice for so many destroyers of ‘world peace’. The much-abused,much-misunderstood and much-programmed Michael Jackson took people into thegrotesque underworld of Satanism in his 1980s video Thriller. You can see it onYouTube if you haven’t already. It is no coincidence whatsoever that Jacksonturns around at the end to reveal reptilian eyes (Fig 336). I am not saying thatJackson was anything like perfect, but the guy was so used and abused by theCabal to influence the minds of the young and took the consequences later whenhe tried to break free. Jackson released a song called Scared of the Moon –Satanic rituals often involving children follow the Moon cycles. The lyrics say:[../Images/00224.jpg]Figure 336: Michael Jackson at the end of Thriller.> Alone she lays waiting> Surrounded by gloom> Invaded by shadows> Painting the room> The light from the window> Cuts through the air> And pins the child lying there> Scared of the moon> She pulls up the covers> And shivers in fright> She hides from the colour> That rides on the night> The light through the window> That lights up the sky> And causes her mournful cry> Scared of the moon ...> ... The feeling of terror> She felt as a youth> Has turned from a fantasy> Into the truth> The moon is the enemy> Twisting her soul> And taking its fearful toll> Scared of the moonMichael Jackson knew a lot about how the Archon bloodlines work after a lifetimeof experience beginning with abuse at a very early age. The name Hollywood isderived from the holy or holly wood. This is a reference to the holly wood wanddecorated with hieroglyphs used by Celtic Druids for their ritual ‘magic’. Hollyis considered the sacred plant of Saturn and was an essential part of the RomanFestival of Saturnalia which became our Christmas – hence holly (Saturn) isdisplayed at Christmas. The Queen’s official residence in Edinburgh, Scotland,is called the Palace of Holyroodhouse and this has same origin and symbolism.The palace stands at one end of the so-called ‘Royal Mile’ which leads toEdinburgh Castle and the palace takes its name from the adjacent Holyrood Abbey.The official explanation is that Holyrood means ‘holy rod’ (yes, it does, theDruid holly-wand); but we are told, ludicrously, that this ‘holy rod’ refers tothe cross on which Jesus was (not) crucified. The tale is embellished even moreridiculously by the claim that a piece of the cross was brought to Scotland andled to the name, Holyrood. Some researchers have also pointed out that ‘rood’ inDutch means red (the colour of Saturnism/Satanism) and red is a front-line themein their ritual and symbolism. Everything to these people is ritual andsymbolism because it involves the manipulation of energy and perception. It isalso provides an energetic connection to their god Saturn and all that goes withit.Grid ControlAnother prime aspect of Satanism-Saturnism is to control the nature of thefrequencies and information encoded in the Earth energy field with whichhumanity is constantly interacting. This field is our most immediate connectionto the Cosmic Internet and by infiltrating, distorting and manipulating thefield they can disconnect people from the influence and insight of expandedreality. The Archon goal has been to synchronise the Earth field with their ownwaveform programs and frequencies and, through this field, connect the humanenergy field with those same programs and frequencies (Fig 337). This underpinsthe overall effect of the Saturn-Moon hack. Major Satanists perform theirrituals in stone circles; around ancient standing stones; in their own satanictemples, including those of connected secret societies (Freemasons, Knights ofMalta, Knights Templar, Jesuits etc.). One of their prime locations isunderneath the main Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City (Figure 338). They alsoperform them in churches either covertly or because the local clergy are part ofthe cult. The common denominator of these locations and others is theirsignificance with regard to the vortexes and force lines of the energy grid (Fig339). Stone circles and standing stones were erected by the ancients on theselines and vortexes and the same is true of major secret society temples and manychurches and Cathedrals that were placed on ‘former’ pagan sites located atsignificant points on the grid. This has been done in fine detail and here aretwo of millions of examples worldwide. There are two closely-connected forcelines passing across England known as the Michael and Mary lines. They are saidto be male and female energies and they have been traced by dowsing rods andtechnology which can identify their electromagnetic patterns. They arecollectively known as the ‘serpent line’ and they cross at power centresincluding Avebury, the biggest stone circle in Europe, and Glastonbury Tor (Fig340). They also pass through churches and abbeys, including Glastonbury Abbeyand Bury St Edmunds Abbey, and significant landscape features and ancientearthworks such as Cadbury Castle. You find the same the world over and in factthe Michael-Mary lines are said to encircle the planet passing through northernEurope, Asia, Australia and South America. London and Britain are together sucha major global centre for the bloodline network because it is a major globalcentre for the Earth’s network of force lines and vortexes. I became aware ofall this soon after my visit to psychic Betty Shine in 1990. I don’t go with‘channelled’ information unless the person involved has a long track record ofaccuracy and my intuition is saying a big ‘yes’. A lot of channelled informationis airy-fairy nonsense and much of the rest is designed by manipulativeArchontic sources to misdirect the listener. Channels allow their decodingprocesses to be taken over by energetic projections which use their vocal chordsto communicate with this reality. The questions that must be asked, however,are: What is the source of the projection and what is the intent? People need tobe really discerning and careful with this stuff, but now and again channelledcommunications stand the test of hindsight and the passage of events. I had onesuch experience in 1990, only weeks after my life-changing visit to Betty Shine.I was taken to see a ‘channel’ in a small town in the west of England. It wasall new to me then and I wondered what was going to happen. She went intochannel mode and her face clearly changed – a mild shapeshift – and her voicewas very different when she began to speak. Part of the communication said:[../Images/00454.jpg]Figure 337: The Archons seek to control the information circulating in theenergy ‘sea’.[../Images/00201.jpg]Figure 338: The Archontic Mormon Temple.[../Images/00433.jpg]Figure 339: Energy lines (ley lines or meridians)connect at vortex points tocreate a global grid.[../Images/00399.jpg]Figure 340: Glastonbury Tor.> As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet, through your> planet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to the acupuncture lines and> meridians in your body.

Christopher Street isamong Britain’s foremost researchers on these subjects and he has produced aseries of books about the energy grid of London, including London: City ofRevelation. He has identified an energy meridian passing through London that hedubs ‘London’s Mary Line’ because it follows a straight line through a series ofchurches dedicated to Mother Mary or Mary Magdalene. This includes the church ofSt Marylebone (St Mary-le-bone) which many occultists believe is aninterdimensional doorway that only those with ‘the knowledge’ can access. Thisdoorway is claimed to expand for more than two miles across Regents Park toPrimrose Hill. This was apparently the very area of land that William Blake wasreferring to when he wrote his poem-come-hymn Jerusalem in the early 19thcentury about the establishment of the New Jerusalem in ‘England’s green andpleasant land’. The area was only fields at the time. Blake painted the Chronosimage called The Ancient of Days, appeared to be connected to a Druidic order,and certainly had a deep knowledge of the esoteric and the hidden or ‘occult’.He wrote in another poem:> The fields from Islington to Marybone,> To Primrose Hill and Saint John’s Wood:> Were builded over with pillars of gold,> And there Jerusalem’s pillars stood.There is a meridian alignment known as the Coronation Line which connectsWestminster Abbey with St Paul’s Cathedral, the famous clock at the Houses ofParliament called Big Ben (obelisk/time), and the site of Blackfriars Monasterywhich was so named because the Dominican monks wore black cloaks. BlackfriarsBridge crosses the Thames and takes people and traffic into ‘The City’ – aglobal centre for Archon bloodline manipulation. Another straight ley ormeridian featured by Chris Street connects Stonehenge, the Tower of London (themonarch’s ‘Royal Palace and Fortress’), Southwark Cathedral, the Houses ofParliament and Westminster Abbey. What are the chances of this if the buildingswere not placed by specific design? The line also goes through the Royal Mintwhich established monopolistic control of money for ‘the Crown’ (which means theArchon bloodline hierarchy and not only the British monarch). One meridianconnects ancient knowledge (Stonehenge), the monarch (Tower of London), politics(Houses of Parliament), religion (the cathedrals) and finance (Royal Mint). Howappropriate given that they have all been created and controlled by the sameforce. Satanism, secret societies, monarchy, politics, finance and the Churchare all connected to the same hidden knowledge and the same hidden masters.Satanism and secret societies keep this knowledge out of public awarenessthrough strictly enforced compartmentalised secrecy while the Church hides theknowledge and rituals of its the inner core behind a cover-story manufacturedfrom the literal interpretation of symbolic texts and recycled fairy tales. Afew years ago a document came to light in Australia that was claimed to bewritten by a dying Satanist allegedly connected to the ‘Alpha Lodge’ of Satanismin Sydney. He apparently died in 2004 and the document came to light yearslater. I publish it in full as an appendix in Human Race Get off Your Knees. Ican’t say for sure if it’s genuine, but nearly a quarter of a century ofresearch shows me that whoever wrote the document had a very detailedunderstanding of Satanism and its methods and goals. It describes how Satanistsand their stooges are placed in positions of public power in politics andthroughout the system and how Satanism targets the Earth energy grid withrepeating rituals at the same locations. The document said: ‘What most people donot realise is that Satanism is a ritually-based practice and that thisrepetition has – over time – left strong impressions upon the Morphic Field!’They engage in mass rituals to this same end, which are hidden behind royal andreligious pomp and ceremony, sporting events like the Olympic Games, and othergreat gatherings of people and collective attention. I will be expanding onthis.Possession is not a mythI know that many people will see the whole idea of possession andblocking/manipulating the Earth energy grids as some far-out nonsense, but nomatter. The fact remains that this is real and you cannot understand the worldand what is happening without knowing about this energetic background. I haveseen possession at work many times over the years and I had another experienceon my return trip to Peru and Bolivia in 2012. It was on the day which had manythemes relating to malevolent entities and energies which took us to the ancientruins at Tiwanaku in Bolivia. The last stop that day was back across the borderin Peru at a place apparently known by some as ‘Devil’s Gate’. It has anotherless ominous official name, but Devil’s Gate was very appropriate given theenergy that it was giving off. Once again we are back to gates and gatewaysconnecting this reality to that of the ‘gods’. The location has been known asthe ‘City of the Gods’ and is said to be an interdimensional portal or stargate– hence its official name, Puerta de Hayu Marca, or Gate of the Gods. Oh really?What ‘gods’ would they be, then? A lot of New Agers talk about stargates and soon, but the question is this: even if that is true, and on many occasions itwill be, to what kind of dimension or reality do such ‘gates’ lead? This is thebit that is so often missing from the equation and if this ‘Gate of the Gods’did lead to another reality it was not one that I cared to visit, thanks verymuch. You might remember the dragon rock formation that I described earlier inthe book and the ‘gate’ was in the side of that ‘dragon’. It was close to darkwhen we arrived at the place and soon it was pitch black. The group continued totake photographs and many shots came out with streaks of light on them (Fig341). It could have been something to do with the way they were taken, I guess,but no one could explain why. There was certainly a lot of activity going on inthe energy field there. You could feel it and most of it wasn’t nice. There wasalso a strange image in which half of me was in focus and the other half wasn’t(Fig 342). Once again, there may be a photographic explanation for all I know,but no one has produced it yet. The image also gives at least a symbolic feelfor how fluid the body really is. It is an illusory-solid hologram and what weperceive as the ‘physical’ is only a microfrequency. I went to some rocks alittle walk from the ‘gate’ – rocks known in legend as the ‘guardians of thegate’ – while most of the group headed for the ‘gate’ itself. This consists of alarge sheet of red rock with a ‘window’ or ‘doorway’ cut out of it, andalongside are two crevices like pillars which remind you of the twin towers orpillars of Freemasonry. People were trying out the ‘gate’ while I was sitting onthe rocks some distance away and I had no intention of going over there – untilI heard a series of loud cries coming from that direction. I asked our Peruvianguide sitting nearby what the noise was and if there were any animals that couldexplain it. He made some throwaway comment and carried on checking his mobilephone. But the noise had caught my interest and I started to walk through thedarkness in the direction of the gate. Soon a member of the group coming theother way told me not to bother going over there because it was horrible – evil.He said that one of the party was also having a bad experience. I quickened mypace and went with him to see what was happening. When I arrived I saw a groupof people around a man who was sitting inside one of the crevice ‘pillars’ andthey were trying to comfort him. This had been the source of the loud cries andhe looked in considerable distress holding his head and sometimes thrashingaround. I had seen this many times before over the years. ‘Something’ hadliterally got into him. It was a form of possession. I asked people to get himout of the crevice or ‘niche’ in the rock, which they did. The same behaviourcontinued as they tried to move him further away.[../Images/00311.jpg]Figure 341: Walking to the ‘Gate of the Gods’.[../Images/00526.jpg]Figure 342: Partly sharp and partly blurred. Ugh?It was clear to me that whatever had attached to him was staying put unless itwas removed. My great friend Linda was in the party and suggested that peopleform a small ring around him and begin to give him energy. I emphasised that itneeded to be heart energy because Archontic entities like this cannot stay in aheart energy field. Their energetic ‘stadium’ is low-vibrational emotion andfear and that is why they have manipulated events, genetics and human society tocontinually produce tidal waves of the stuff. If humanity filled this realitywith heart energy the predator race would have to leave. I went inside the smallring of people and put my hands just above the man’s head – his crown chakra.This is where the entities can get in and this is where you can get them out.Some people remarked that almost immediately I put my hands over his head theman became calm and laid down. This was because the entity had moved its focusfrom imposing itself on the man to surviving in the energy field that was nowbeing generated by the ring of people and my hands. The man lay down and I kneltat his head with my hands on his crown chakra and demanded – commanded – inwords of one syllable that the entity leave. Within seconds I felt a strongmagnetic field attaching to my hands and in a flash I felt it pass through meand out the top of my head. Immediately this happened, not even seconds later,the man became himself again. These entities are electromagnetic beings and theyattach themselves to the human electromagnetic field, or auric field, and fromthere dictate mental, emotional and ‘physical’ behaviour. This is why I felt anelectromagnetic field attach to my hands when the entity was coming out. Theseare the same Archontic entities that possess those in the positions of power inpolitics, banking, corporations, the media and the military, and so on. They areso heartless – note the term heart-less, devoid of heart energy – because theentities that possess them are heart-less. The Archon hybrids have a greatergenetic (therefore vibrational) compatibility with the entities and so are muchmore powerfully possessable than the general run of the population. But it canhappen to anyone to a larger or lesser extent and this is why people have to bestreetwise to the phenomenon. Those selected to serve the Control System arepossessed by these entities during secret society and Satanic rituals and thesymbols of Saturn generate the energy field in the temples and rituals thatcreate an energetic conduit for entities to come in. Someone may join theFreemasons and think that the rituals are strange and potty, but what they don’tknow is that they are specifically designed to allow entities to attach to thetarget and slowly, but surely, their personality begins to change. When it haschanged sufficiently and become heart-less enough, they go on to be a leadingpolitician, banker and whatever else the secret networks have in mind for them.The general population can be most open to possession at times of extremedepression (and other low vibrational energetic states), and drugs and heavydrinking can seriously open the door, too. So can having sex with a possessedperson, because the energetic connection creates a mutual field which theentities can cross. Two days after the experience that night at the gatesynchronicity took me back there with a few members of the group so we could seethe layout of the place in the daytime (Fig 343). The rock formations in thearea were quite a sight to see as I walked across to the ‘gate’ itself. We satfor a while in the energy field and it was the general opinion that the placewas indeed deeply unpleasant or ‘evil’. Locals told us how the legends said thatif you didn’t go there ‘prepared’ then the place could make you ‘go crazy’. Yes,‘prepared’ by being in a heart-open high-vibrational state or the entities canaccess – possess – your energy field. It was clear to me that the place was notonly highly malevolent, but was of great significance in its effect on theearth-energy grid in this area and probably wider afield. Two men who watchedover the site for a government agency said that energy lines passed through the‘gate’ rocks which connected Cusco, Machu Picchu, Sillustani (where I had mylife-changing experience) and Tiwanaku. These happened to be all the places wehad visited on the trip. I decided to do what I have done at so many sites overthe last two decades, but this time what came through me was more powerful thanever before. It is so simple and anyone can do it if they know what they aredoing and they are in tune with their own energetic power. I stood at the ‘gate’and commanded the malevolence to leave. You don’t ask, you command, becausehumans in their power are giants to their little boys in short trousers.‘Demonic’ entities only have the power that we give them because of amanipulated belief in their power. It’s all a mind game and we need to calltheir bluff. While commanding the entities to leave, I opened the flow of heartenergy both directly from my heart vortex and through my hands while asking thecosmic power of love and harmony to come through me (Fig 344). In no more thanthree or four minutes the malevolence had flipped into a very differentvibration in which malevolence cannot survive. Others in the group felt ithappen even though they had no idea what I was doing – only that I was standingfacing the rock. It was all captured on film for the DVD Return to Peru(available at Davidicke.com [http://www.Davidicke.com]) with people describingon camera the change that they suddenly felt. The energy there may have beenmalevolent for thousands of years possibly, but it matters not. I cannotemphasise enough: WE have the power, not the malevolence. When enough peoplerealise that, the house of cards will fall. More surprises were to follow whenwe walked in the sunshine to the other side of the ‘dragon’ rock away from thegate. First of all, people were feeling the malevolence once again, but in a fewminutes of doing the same process the energy changed to one that was lovely toexperience. WE have the power, not them. The gate and rock formations wereacting as a vibrational blocker on the energy grid. These blocks can be foundall over the world and today they locate nuclear power stations, major roadinterchanges, etc., at major energy points to suppress the energy (information)available to the target human population and to lower the vibrational state ofthe energy ‘sea’. The biggest stone circle in Europe, at Avebury in Wiltshire,England, has a main road going through the middle when there was plenty of roomto go around the site. From deep in the shadows this is done by design. As I wastalking to the group about some of these subjects on the third visit to the‘gate’, I heard a gasp and some began pointing to the sky where a rainbow faceimage suddenly formed from the cloud directly above our heads (Fig 345 and 346).Maybe it was all just a coincidence, but it didn’t feel like that. A faceappeared in the smoke when the second tower was struck on 9/11 (Fig 347). Thiscan happen because the Archons are electromagnetic and can impact and imprintupon the electromagnetic field. The world is so different to the one that peoplethink they know.[../Images/00421.jpg]Figure 343: The Gate of the Gods.[../Images/00136.jpg]Figure 344: The power of the human mind, heart and energy field can overcomeArchontic influence when we tap into the greater self.[../Images/00342.jpg]Figure 345: The rainbow ‘face’ in the sky which doesn’t obviously reproduce wellin black and white but it gives you a feel for what we saw.[../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 346: ... over the Gate of the Gods.[../Images/00206.jpg]Figure 347: The face-like image in the smoke and fire on 9/11. It may just be atrick of the light or something, but the Archons in their base state are pureenergy and able to take any form.Satan’s governmentsThe Australian Satanist document that came to light in 2004 confirmed all thethemes that I am highlighting. It says that Satanists are manipulated into powerthroughout society and the influence of Satanism is ‘now so pervasive as not tobe readily noticed’:> Amongst the highest echelons some are politicians, medical doctors, high> ranking police officers, lawyers, advertising gurus, decorated military men,> media personalities, fashion models and social workers. Amongst the lowest> (usually temporary) ranks are prostitutes, minor drug dealers and a number of> High School students. Some operate from the mists.> Their victims are drip-fed straight amnesia by an assortment of mind control> measures and psychological torture tactics that would leave any normal person> numb with the dawning apprehension that things are not as they seem – and they> have not been for a long, long time. The most talented amongst them have> lifestyles maintained on crime, but lacquered with a thin veneer of> respectable professionalism and knowledge.This is all correct. The political, banking, corporate, media and militarysystem is controlled by Satanists – Archon bloodline-hybrid worshippers of theDemiurge – and their lackeys who are given public power in return for totalobedience. The Australian Satanist also explained how politicians are entrappedby enticing them into compromising situations, especially involving sex withchildren. I have been exposing precisely this since the mid-1990s. The fact thatthis is happening at all will be shocking to most people, but the scale of it istruly breathtaking. It is the norm in the ‘upper’ (cesspit) levels of the powerstructure. The Satanist document said:> Politicians are introduced by a carefully graded set of criteria and> situations that enable them to accept that their victims will be, ‘Our little> secret’. Young children sexually molested and physically abused by politicians> worldwide are quickly used as sacrifices. In Australia, the bodies are hardly> ever discovered, for Australia is still a wilderness.This is happening the world over and on a scale that beggars belief. In highlypopulated countries the bodies are disposed of through incineration atcrematoria controlled by the cults or buried in the countryside. It is throughthese satanic networks that Satanists, paedophiles and serial child-killers likeformer British Prime Minister Edward ‘black eyes’ Heath get into positions ofpower to serve the Archon agenda. The biggest contribution in his case was topave the way for the deletion of British sovereignty by leading the campaign tojoin what is now called the European Union. It was Heath as Prime Minister whosigned the entry documents after covertly agreeing to run down and destroyBritain’s fishing, mining, steelmaking and manufacturing industries on behalf ofa European superstate in which each country has been unofficially designatedspecialisations. Britain was designated finance and ‘service industries’. Thiscame out decades later when government papers came to light, by which time thedeed was done. Satanists operate in all political parties with any chance offorming a government (and most that don’t) and so the same agenda continues tobe enforced no matter who wins a farcical and meaningless ‘election’. I exposeSatanism and its famous front people at length in many books, including TheBiggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. The former wife of Fernando Collor deMelo, the Brazilian president in the early 1990s, told Globo television in 2012that he was a Satanist. She said: ‘There were doings in cemeteries, verypowerful rituals, and with animals it was a complete slaughter of the chickens,oxen, cattle and other animals that were sacrificed.’ The former president’sbrother, Pedro Collor de Melo, said the same in 1992. Rosane Collor de Melo saidthat the rituals were led by a witch named Maria Cecilia who now has a seat inthe Senate and is allied with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. I have beenresearching Satanism for two decades and what was in the Australian document wasall familiar to me, including the mention of a Satanist of global importance whouses the code-name ‘Pindar’. This means, according to at least one long-timeinsider, ‘penis of the dragon’. I think simply ‘penis’ would do for this chap. Ifirst mentioned Pindar in The Biggest Secret which was first published in 1998.Pindar is said to reside in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France near the Germanborder. This area often comes up with regard to Archon-Reptilian hybrids.Alsace-Lorraine includes the city of Strasburg, home to the utterly irrelevantEuropean Parliament, and also Verdun, where an estimated 698,000 troops died inone of the most devastating battles of the First World War. This was yet anothermass blood ritual to serve the interests and energetic-demands of the Archonsand their hybrids. I have been told by insiders that Pindar travels to the mainsacrifice rituals in different parts of the world in accordance with the satanicritual calendar. One even said that he is the real father of Prince Charles. Younever know who is truly what with these bloodlines because they interbreed onthe basis of genetics and what is genetically necessary is always done – henceCharles had to do his ‘duty’ with Princess Diana when his preferred partner wasCamilla Parker-Bowles. Genetics, ritual and symbolism are at the centre ofeverything and is it really a coincidence that the underground bunker or‘fortress’ beneath the UK Ministry of Defence across the road from the PrimeMinister’s residence in Downing Street is called PINDAR? Or that thecoordination centre for British government-military-security agency leaders at atime of ‘national emergency’ is called COBRA, one of the major symbols of theArchon-Reptilians used by the ancients?The German satanic (Rothschild) connectionSatanism and power go together because Satanism serves the Demiurge-Archons, solook at the families in overt or covert power and they will either be Satanistsor the lackeys of Satanists. The former most certainly applies to theRothschilds and Rockefellers, for example, and the British royal family. TheRothschilds and Rockefellers are both German Jewish families and so is the Houseof Windsor. The Rothschilds accept the ‘Jewish’ bit while the Rockefellers andWindsors seek to hide this fact. The Rockefellers were the German Rockenfelders,Roggenfeder and some say Reichenfelder before they moved to America in the 18thcentury and changed their name to Rockefeller. This ‘out of Germany’ scenario isa very common for the Archon bloodline families and the institutions theyspawned such as major banks including Goldman Sachs. They are former Khazars whomoved up into Eastern and Western Europe after the Khazar Empire ended and‘former Khazars’ means former Sumerians/Babylonians (not Hebrews or Israelites).This is why there is so much Babylonian symbolism throughout society and thatmeans to a very large extent Saturn symbolism. The very name ‘Rothschild’ comesfrom the red (symbolic of Saturn) six-pointed-star (symbol of Saturn) that wasdisplayed on their house in Frankfurt when they were called Bauer. When theyestablished the State of Israel they used the family symbol on the flag ofIs-Ra-El. Another major hybrid bloodline is called Russell (not everyone calledRussell just this particular strand) and this, too, relates both to red and El,the Saturn god of Judaism. The bloodline Russells are a Jewish(Khazar/Sumerian/Babylonian) family from Germany once known as Roesel, Rosel andRossel (Red- El). Many Jewish families Americanised their names when they leftGermany and other European countries and headed for the United States. TheRoosevelt family which produced two US presidents were the Rosenfelt family fromthe Netherlands. Charles Taze Russell, a founder of the Watchtower Society, orJehovah’s Witnesses, was a member of the bloodline Russell clan. The WatchtowerSociety is literally satanic at its core and so is the Mormon Church which wasestablished by bloodline Freemasons Joseph Smith and his brother Hiram beforethe ‘faith’ was taken forward by bloodline Freemason Brigham Young. Mormonism isbased on Freemasonry right down to its secret handshakes and other codes and wehave seen that inverted satanic symbols abound at its main temple in Salt LakeCity. There is another theme that is common to both: They were funded intoexistence by the Rothschilds – as were wars and manipulated ‘revolutions’ likethe Russian Revolution. The Jewish (Khazar/Sumerian/Babylonian)‘revolutionaries’ Lenin and Trotsky and the whole deal was funded by theRothschild bank in New York, Kuhn Loeb and Company. This was headed by GermanJew Jacob Schiff (see ... And the Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailedbackground). The Schiff family once lived with the Rothschilds at their ‘redshield’ house in Frankfurt, and Kuhn, Loeb was established by Solomon Loeb andAbraham Kuhn who had both emigrated to America from the Rothschild fiefdom ofGermany – a very familiar story. When I speak of these now bigname Germanimmigrants to the United States, I mean in every case agents of the Rothschilds.The infamous and satanic banking abomination called Goldman Sachs was founded bytwo other ‘out-of-Germany’ Jewish (Khazar/Sumerian/Babylonian) families in theform of Marcus Goldman and his son-in-law, Samuel Sachs. Both families came fromthe highly significant bloodline region of Bavaria which spawned major bloodlineassets like Rothschild Zionist Henry Kissinger and Pope Benedict (JosephRatzinger), formerly of Nazi Youth. A stream of ‘Jewish’ people left Germany,and often Bavaria, in the 19th and early 20th centuries to establish majorbanks, companies and organisations in the United States. These included theRothschild-front B’nai B’rith, or ‘Sons of the Covenant’. This comes from the‘Ark of the Covenant’ which itself originates from the Egyptian Ark of theContract, according to American symbolism researcher, Jordan Maxwell. He saysthat this ‘contract’ was with ‘non-human visitors’. B’nai B’rith was launched in1843 and all twelve of its official founders were born in Germany and moved toNew York in the same period from the late 1820s and early 1830s. Theorganisation calls itself the ‘global voice of the Jewish Community’ when it isreally the voice of the Rothschilds and the Rothschild Zionist El-lite. B’naiB’rith and its temper-tantrum child, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), currentlyled by the ridiculous Abe Foxman, have the role of branding anyone who gets tooclose to the truth about the Rothschilds and their networks as ‘anti-Semitic’.The Rothschilds were the prime manipulators and funders of all sides in the twoworld wars and they were behind the Nazi Party and the subsequent terror whichled large numbers of German Jews to head for the United States and to Palestinewhere they bombed and terrorised the country into what is now called Israel.These bombers and terrorisers had no connection to the country they wereinvading, but some 800,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their home in fearof their lives never to return. I explain in great detail in other books howRothschild manipulation has weaved its way through history since the 17thcentury – actually caused most of that history – through to the present day. Thefollowing is only a fraction of their grotesque ‘CV’:• The Rothschilds created the infamous Bavarian Illuminati – note Bavarian –which instigated the French Revolution and many other fake uprisings thatchanged society in ways that suited them (see the ‘Arab Spring’ for a modernversion of this technique). The group’s own seized documents confirmed its plansfor the transformation of human society into what we would call an Orwellianstate.• The Rothschilds established Zionism with a cover story about representingJewish interests when at its core it is an Archon bloodline secret societyserving Demiurge-Archon interests at the expense of the general Jewishpopulation and all of humanity. The Rothschilds were behind the first ZionistCongress in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897 and Theodor Herzl, the ‘father’ ofpolitical Zionism, was a Rothschild gofer. What Israel, the United States andothers do in the name of ‘Zionism’ (by false implication ‘Jewish people’) isactually done to advance the bloodline agenda which doesn’t give a shit aboutJewish people who are not Rothschild initiates or agents. Theodor Herzl wrote inhis diary:> It is essential that the sufferings of Jews ... become worse ... this will> assist in realization of our plans ... I have an excellent idea ... I shall> induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth ... The anti-Semites will> assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression> of Jews. The anti-Semites shall be our best friends.• The Rothschilds have funded and orchestrated the Russian Revolution, bothWorld Wars and endless other conflicts right to the present day in Libya andSyria. This is their recurring modus operandi: fund all sides in wars that theRothschilds have instigated through their governments and media; make sure the‘fund’ is in the form of nonexistent money called ‘credit’ so that in reality itcosts them nothing; supply the countries with armaments fromRothschild-controlled ‘defence’ contractors; and, when they have mutuallydevastated each other, lend the governments more credit to rebuild theircountries. In this way, the Rothschilds own countries (and thus the people)through staggering levels of accumulated debt.• There is another version of this in places like Iraq and Libya in which theymanipulate events through Rothschild-controlled governments and NATO to bomb todestruction a target regime which is not playing ball, especially if the countryhas vast oil reserves and other resources that they can then steal through theRothschild-controlled oil and banking cartel.Whenever you see Zionism and major Zionists you are looking at the Rothschilds.Rothschild ritualsThe controlling heartless centre of the Rothschild family (most outer membershaven’t got a clue) are leading Satanists and this has been the case at leastsince they were a late Middle Ages occult family called Bauer. Americanresearcher Fritz Springmeier, who has specialised in the bloodlines, Satanismand mind control, reports that people who have visited Rothschild homes havedescribed how they even set a place for ‘Satan’ at their dinner table. This isin line with endless accounts I have pick up over the years of the fundamentalconnection between the inner Rothschilds and Satanism – and Satanists manipulatereality by manipulating the observer’s perception of reality. This is why theyare called black magicians. I have described in other books my correspondencewith a man who says that his real name is Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, butlives under another name in the United States since he left the Rothschild foldin disgust at the death and suffering they are instigating and perpetuating. Heis one of a global army of unofficial Rothschilds procreated in secret andthrough the sperm banks (biological software banks). Phillip told me that he wasthe bloodline son of Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wineestates in France. They love their titles – the reptilian brain’s ‘obsessionwith hierarchical structures of power’. The Baron died in 1988 at the age of 86.Phillip told me that his father was ‘a decadent dilettante as well as a masterSatanist’ and that he was conceived by ‘occult incest’ to preserve the hybridgenetic code. Incest is part of life for Archon bloodline children and it is away for the fathers to impose lifetime control over their offspring. Bloodlinefamilies have incestuously inbred since ancient times with brothers marryingsisters and suchlike. When they say that they want you to meet their sister andtheir wife there is only one woman standing there. Phillip said that he was‘held fast in the emotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was normaland to be admired’. They do it to their children in the first years of theirlives to make the child ‘bond’ with – obey – the father. This would certainlyhave happened with people like Boy George Bush and the addicted paedophile thatis his father. When children are sexually abused by a priest it can bond themboth to the priest and the Church that he represents. The incest is mostly analsex which targets the lower chakra (colour red) at the base of the spine whichstimulates the reptilian brain at the top of the spine and this, of course, iswhat happens with the clergy and their boy victims. Phillip Eugene de Rothschildwas yet another who confirmed to me that the Rothschilds and the bloodlines ingeneral glory in being possessed by demonic entities. The Rothschilds are sohigh in the human hierarchy because they are possessed by entities that are highin the Demiurge-Archon hierarchy. ‘Being a Rothschild descendant, I wasmaximally demonised’, he told me. Stanley Kubrick, the great American filmmaker,was an insider who faked the filming of the first ‘Moon landings’ in 1969 underthe cover of his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (see Human Race Get Off Your Kneesand the website of American filmmaker Jay Weidner at jayweidner.com[http://www.jayweidner.com]). Kubrick later tried to expose the bloodline plotwith coded scenes in his movies. One of them was in his last film, Eyes WideShut, released in 1999, which portrayed the mind control programmes and satanicrituals of the El-ite. The film features a satanic ritual which was mildcompared with the real thing, but he went as far as he could. The mansion inwhich the ritual scenes were filmed was owned by the Rothschilds (Fig 348).Kubrick died a few days after he finished the edit and, before he died, refuseda demand from Warner Bros executives to make substantial cuts. The film wasreleased with the minimum of promotion after he died with 25 minutes taken outthat the public has never seen. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild told me that hisrole in the family’s ‘grand conspiracy’ was to infiltrate the Christian Churchand appear to be the perfect Christian when he was, at the time, a Satanist.Phillip described to me how he had attended rituals with many people who were,or went on to be, the rich and famous El-lite. These included Bill Clinton whowould become President of the United States, and Al Gore, Clinton’sVice-President and the global frontman for the Big Lie about human-caused‘climate change’. Phillip went on:[../Images/00118.jpg]Figure 348: The ritual in Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut.> I was present at my father’s death in 1988, receiving his power and the> commission to carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family. Like> their other children, I played a key role in my family’s revolt from God. When> I watch CNN, it startles me to see so many familiar faces now on the world> stage in politics, art, finance, fashion and business. I grew up with these> people, meeting them at ritual worship sites and in the centres of power.> Financiers, artists, royalty, and even Presidents ...> ... I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but never> having the supremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not real> brokers of occult power. Except for Alan Greenspan [long-time head of the US> Federal Reserve], most of these fellows were camp followers in the occult,> primarily for the economic power and prestige. Greenspan, I recall, was a> person of tremendous spiritual, occult power and could make the Bushes and the> younger Rockefellers cower with just a glance.> Ex-CIA Director Casey (as were most of the CIA leadership for the past forty> years), Kissinger, and [former US Secretary of State] Warren Christopher were> in attendance at non-ritual gatherings and some occult rituals as well, but> well back in the gallery.The line that Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist) could ‘make the Bushes and theyounger Rockefellers cower with just a glance’ is extremely instructive (Fig349). Greenspan was officially appointed as head of the privately-owned(Rothschild-owned) Federal Reserve in the 1980s by President ‘what’s my name,where am I?’ Reagan. The ‘Fed’ is supposed to be the independent central bank ofthe United States. Pause for uncontrollable laughter – this could take some time... Greenspan’s continued appointment as head of the Fed was confirmed byPresidents Father George Bush, Bill Clinton and Boy George ‘what’s my name,where am I?’ Bush; but it wasn’t their decision. Greenspan and the leadingSatanists told them who was going to head the Fed, not the other way round, justas they told them who their major and less than major personnel of governmentwere going to be. The same happened when Alan Greenspan (Rothschild Zionist)resigned in 2006 before the economic crash that he had long engineered and wasreplaced by Ben Bernanke (Rothschild Zionist). What are the statistical chancesof Federal Reserve chiefs from the 1980s to present day coming from the sameless than two percent of the American population? But the satanic and RothschildZionist hierarchy trumps the public hierarchy every time. It was during his longyears at the Federal Reserve, in league with Clinton Treasury Secretaries RobertE Rubin (Rothschild Zionist) and Larry Summers (Rothschild Zionist), that thechecks and balances were systematically removed that allowed the banking andfinancial system to crash amid the inevitable and predictable consequences ofunchecked greed and criminal activity. This triggered a global financialmeltdown which is exactly what was planned as part of the Archon strategy tosqueeze humanity until the pips squeak and make people agree to whatever theydemand – much more about this later. The banking system is controlled bySatanists and the merciless Archon bloodlines which, of course, explains a lot.A Swiss banker confirmed this in an anonymous interview in 2011 for the Russianmagazine, NoviDen:[../Images/00525.jpg]Figure 349: Alan Greenspan.> ... these people are corrupt, sick in their minds, so sick they are full of> vices and those vices are kept under wraps on their orders. Some of them ...> rape women, others are sado maso, or paedophile, and many are into Satanism.> When you go in some banks you see these satanistic symbols, like in the> Rothschild Bank in Zurich. These people are controlled by blackmail because of> the weaknesses they have. They have to follow orders or they will be exposed,> they will be destroyed or even killed.Paedophilia and Satanism are fundamentally connected and this is why so manypeople in positions of royal, political, corporate and religious influence areboth paedophiles and Satanists. I will be explaining the significance to theArchons of paedophilia because it is so vitally important to understand humansociety."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00318.jpg]Rothschild Royalty and the Shapeshifting WindsorsThe public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worthknowing.Oscar WildeGermany is once again a theme with the British royal family. This offshoot ofthe German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha conveniently changed its name to ‘Windsor’when Britain was at war with another wing of the family in 1917.The monarchy of Belgium is also Saxe-Coburg-Gotha while the Dutch monarchy, theHouse of Orange-Nassau, is similarly of German descent. This connection wasfurther entrenched when Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, a former Nazi SSofficer, married the future Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. In fact, Germanbloodlines, or bloodlines that located in Germany after their journey overthousands of years from ancient Sumer, Babylon and Egypt, are a theme of theglobal Archon bloodline network in general. The covert interbreeding is suchthat it is not possible without their own carefully-compiled genetic records toknow exactly who came from whom, and where. They are addicted to administration,archiving, bookkeeping and recordkeeping and this trait is related to theirreptilian genetics which demand structure and order with everything and everyonein their designated place. At the centre of this obsession are theirgenealogical libraries that track their own genetic lines in fine detail torecord who is ‘one of us’. If we could see those records we would be amazed atthe true common and parental origins of royalty and the rich and famous ofpolitics, banking, business, media and entertainment. There is a tediousadvertisement running on British television as I write promoting a bettingcompany in which one version of the actor involved says to another version ofhimself: ‘You’re the daddy’. The other ‘self’ replies: ‘No, you’re the daddy’.Well, I wouldn’t bet on who’s the daddy, or sometimes mummy, in relation to thebloodlines when so much interbreeding goes on outside of official marriages. TheArchon bloodline must be served first, not personal preference.Sumerian/Babylonian/Khazar bloodlines like the Rothschilds have used officialmarital and non-marital procreation to infiltrate royal and aristocraticfamilies. Leslie Gilbert Pine, an editor of Burke’s Peerage, which carefullyrecords royal and aristocratic genealogy, said:[../Images/00092.jpg]Figure 350: Princess Diana and Jemima Khan (Goldsmith).Half-sisters?> The Jews have made themselves so closely connected with the British peerage> that the two classes are unlikely to suffer loss which is not mutual ... An> ancient estate is likely to be sold unless some large sums are found. The sums> are found from marriage with a Jewish heiress. Alliances between Jewish ladies> and British lords are mostly of this type, the wife providing large sums ...> while the aristocrat has the title and ancient estate’.[../Images/00275.jpg]Figure 351: Prince William and Zak Goldsmith.The Rothschild bloodline is very much at the fore in this, as you would expect.The 5th Earl of Roseberry, a British Prime Minister, married the only daughterand heiress of Baron Mayer de Rothschild, for example, and the Rothschilds andthe bloodlines go weak at the knees at the thought of a title. This desire isliterally in the blood, or the reptilian brain. I highlighted in Remember WhoYou Are that Frances Ruth Burke Roche, Princess Diana’s mother, was aRothschild. She was better known by her second-marriage name, Frances ShandKydd. Tina Brown, former editor of Vanity Fair, reveals in her book, The DianaChronicles, that Diana’s father could easily have been James Goldsmith, thebillionaire businessman and cousin of the Rothschilds. The one-time Goldschmidtfamily changed their name to Goldsmith around 1895 when they moved to Englandfrom Germany where they were close associates and neighbours of the Rothschilds.Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild dynasty, is reported to havemet with the Goldschmidts in 1773, along with members of the Schiff, Oppenheimerand Warburg families (all Rothschild Zionists) to agree a plan to bankruptnations and control world finance. Tina Brown reports that Diana’s Rothschildmother was in the midst of a long-running affair with James Goldsmith when Dianawas conceived in late 1960, and without doubt there is a close resemblancebetween Diana and members of the Goldsmith family (Figs 350 and 351). This wouldmake Diana’s son William, an heir to the throne, a Rothschild bloodline throughboth his grandmother, the Rothschild Frances Shand Kydd, and his grandfather,James Goldsmith. But, then, how many other members of the royal family and thoseof the rest of Europe are covert Rothschilds when you think that the ‘Windsors’came out of Germany and the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Rothschild basewas in Germany where they were extremely close to royalty of all kinds? Therehas been speculation that Kate Middleton may also have a Rothschild–Goldsmithgenealogical history. Her Jewish mother’s maiden name was Carole Goldsmith,although a connection to ‘that’ Goldsmith family is denied. An Australianmagazine called New Idea ran the Diana-Goldsmith story in 2004 and theestablishment rushed to trash the idea. This reflex-denial was highlighted by acolumnist in the UK Independent:> Make no mistake, with all the freedom of the press, the guard has not changed> at Buckingham Palace and English newspapers only rattle the Royal cages when> not to do so is no longer tenable. So is Diana really Sir James Goldsmith’s> daughter and if so, why does it matter?> And why did top columnists in Fleet St rush into print last week to disclaim a> story, which at present, is believable in exactly the same measure as it is> deniable? In short, only DNA evidence can prove or disprove it. Could it have> had anything to do with the fact that Sir James was Jewish, which would mean> that Diana had Jewish blood and therefore the heirs to the throne of England> would have generous amounts of Jewish blood?> Personally, I’ve believed it for a long time and I’m hoping it’s true. It> certainly explains a lot about Diana: her passion for luvvies, her mood swings> and her obsessive mothering. But more importantly it bodes well for William> and Harry, who could now boast Judaeo-English-German ancestry.The point about the instant-denial by the establishment was well made, but thewriter does not understand the wider background. I wrote in Remember Who You Arethat William’s wife, Kate Middleton, must be genetically acceptable to the clanor they would never have let her come even close to marrying into its dark andsatanic fold. I said that I suspected that she is far more ‘royal’ than shewould appear and insiders will know this given their detailed genetic recordscharting who is bloodline and who isn’t. Much had been made of the royalsaccepting a ‘commoner’ into their midst, but in December 2012 research by aMelbourne school teacher and his senior students revealed that she is actuallyrelated to ‘one of Britain’s oldest and grandest families’. One of her ancestorsis William Petty FitzMaurice, the 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, who was primeminister from 1782 to 1783, and was instrumental in negotiating the end of theAmerican War of Independence. The ancestral pad, Bowood House in Wiltshire, isdescribed as one of Britain’s finest surviving stately homes. That’s more likeit. William Bortrick, a royal genealogist and chairman of the genealogical‘Bible’, Burke’s Peerage, said: ‘Given what a fuss people have made aboutCatherine’s humble background, this will certainly make an interesting inclusionto the next edition of Burke’s Peerage, which we hope to publish after the birthof the Duke and Duchess’ first child.’ Some media reports say that William andKate are distant cousins (Fig 352). Legislation was rushed through the BritishParliament after the announcement of Kate Middleton’s pregnancy to allow thechild to be first in line to be monarch should it be a girl and ahead of anysubsequent brothers that may follow. The male has always taken precedence overthe female up to this point and the law was changed to allow a monarch to bemarried to a Roman Catholic – ending a rule going back centuries. Something’safoot that’s for sure and I don’t mean on the end of your leg. There are somepotentially bad omens for the marriage, particularly for Kate. The engagementring given to her by William was the same one given by his father, PrinceCharles, to his mother, Princess Diana. The ring has a blue sapphire, thegemstone associated with Saturn. Rings in general are Saturn symbols, especiallywedding rings which are placed on the finger in a church when couples getmarried ‘before god’ – the Demiurge-Saturn. The wedding ring is a symbol ofconstriction and ownership. Kate is a Capricorn, the astrological sign ofSaturn, and she married William on April 29th, 2011, while Saturn was in Libra.Prince Charles married Princess Diana 30 years earlier on July 29th, 1981, whenSaturn was in Libra. To the symbolism-obsessed, astrology-obsessed royals thatis in no way a coincidence. Royal families in general are incredibly Saturnianwith their constant rituals, protocols, rules and regulations and strictlyenforced hierarchy. A wonderful example of this came in the summer of 2012 whenthe Queen issued a new ‘protocol’ (ritual) decreeing who must curtsey to whom.This was largely aimed at Kate Middleton or the ‘Duchess of Cambridge’. TheLondon Daily Mail reported the protocol changes after they were circulatedprivately in the Royal Household and I hope you are concentrating ...[../Images/00088.jpg]Figure 352: William and Kate.> Although she is the future Queen, as a former commoner [as the media believed> she was then] Kate must show reverence to the ‘blood princesses’. This means> she is expected to curtsey to those born royal, such as Princesses Beatrice> and Eugenie – both in public and in private.

The complex new rules come in a> little-known edict entitled the Order Of Precedence Of The Royal Family To Be> Observed At Court, which the Queen has updated to take into account the Duke> of Cambridge’s wife.Assert yourself ladies and tell them all to fuck off. This is reptilian geneticsin all its glory – ‘aggressive and ritualistic behaviour, territoriality, adesire for social hierarchies, obsessive compulsive behaviour (addictions of allkinds), conforming to precedent and obsessed with ceremonial re-enactments’. Itis also very Saturnistic. These people can’t help themselves and without theirprotocols (rituals) for everything they would probably implode. In short, theyare unglued, unhinged, unzipped, barmy, batty and so far round the bend thatthey meet themselves coming back. This would be fine if someone locked the doorand left them to it, but they represent and personify the Control System inBritain and worldwide. Still, I guess they have to be nuts given that they areexpressions of the Demiurge which the Gnostics describe as ‘demented’. I feelsorry for Kate Middleton finding herself in the midst of these crazies and Ihope that she doesn’t end up like Princess Diana when the Windsors got theirfangs into her. The ‘blood princesses’, Beatrice and Eugenie, to whom KateMiddleton is now told to curtsey can be seen in Figure 353. May your god helpus.[../Images/00177.jpg]Figure 353: Stops, stares, considers the meaning of life, walks away ...‘Royal’ shapeshifting SatanistsDiana came from the aristocratic Spencer family which married into the family ofWinston Churchill to become the Spencer-Churchills and she was targeted for herbloodline to produce the new future King William (if the Addams family are notpublicly exposed for what they really are by then). Diana was emotionallyshredded by the Windsors who wanted her genetics and then they wanted her gone.I spoke at length many times with a woman in the United States who used thenamed Arizona Wilder. Her birth name was Jennifer Greene. I tell her story indetail in The Biggest Secret, but in summary she described how she wasspecifically bred from psychic bloodlines by the US government mind controlprogramme to conduct sacrifice and other rituals for the satanic Archon hybridsin the US, Britain and the wider Europe. Archons and their hybrid ‘offspring’are extremely limited in how far ‘out there’ they can go because they lack anexpanded form of Consciousness and creative imagination. To overcome thislimitation they breed humans with powerful ‘third-eye’ Body-Mind abilities to go‘out there’ on their behalf during the rituals. Arizona said that she wasmind-programmed using trauma and torture in a technique called trauma-based mindcontrol. People in a state of fear, terror and extreme emotional stress are farmore suggestible and open to programming and this is why so much gratuitousviolence is used in movies to open the mind to subliminal manipulation ofperception. Children in government-military mind control programmes aresubjected to horrific experiences of sexual and violent abuse, watching animalsand other children being sacrificed, electronic torture and all manner ofunspeakable treatment. The mind copes with this by splitting into compartments,or what are called ‘alters’ in the mind control industry, which dissociate thechild from what is happening to them. The crazies then use hypnotic and othermind control techniques to program each alter with a different ‘personality’.This condition is known as dissociative identity disorder (DID) and has alsobeen called multiple personality disorder (MPD). They want to start the processbefore the child’s brain is fully formed and rewire its perceptions while it isstill developing. The victims can be switched between compartments, or alters,and what one alter experiences as a temporary conscious mind none of the otherswill experience and so remember. This means that a famous politician or royalcan have sex with such a child while one alter or compartment is activated andwhen it is over they are switched to another alter that has no memory of whathas happened. Alters can be opened or closed by trigger words, phrases, noises,anything the programmer chooses to encode. I did years of research into this onboth sides of the Atlantic and I have sat with therapists and watchedpersonality after personality opened and closed in their clients by simplygiving the trigger words and codes that have been gleaned only by years of workwith them. I have seen people switch in an instant from a baby to a young child,a seething evil demon and back to their base personality of a nice person (Fig354). This base personality which normally interacts with the world is known inthe mind control trade as the ‘front alter’. The idea behind all this is to taketotal control of a child’s mind and sense of reality and use them in any way youchoose for the rest of their lives – including sexually. Many politicians,Satanists and others throughout the system are in this mind controlled state toensure complete control of events. The ‘front alter’ or personality is the onethat the public see but when they are switched in private into othercompartments they are very, very different people. When some mind-controlled‘multiples’ reach their 30s or 40s or older the walls of the alters can begin todismantle and they remember in often photographic detail what happened to thembecause the mind is so focussed when subjected to extreme trauma that itimprints the memory very powerfully. I have met many of these extraordinarypeople all over the world, especially Britain and America, and the commonstories they tell and famous names that they name make for extremely compellingevidence. I tell the story at length in The Biggest Secret.[../Images/00516.jpg]Figure 354: The many alters of a programmed mind.[../Images/00349.jpg]Figure 355: Angel of Death Josef Mengele.Arizona Wilder says that her main abuser was Josef Mengele, the Nazi ‘Angel ofDeath’ who was helped to escape to the United States and South America by theArchon bloodline networks that control American Intelligence and the RomanChurch (Fig 355). They wanted Mengele, the ‘camp doctor’ at Auschwitz, tocontinue his sickening genetic and mind control research that he had conductedon Jewish children in the concentration camp, often using twins. Nationalborders don’t matter to the Archon cabal – they are one global ‘family’, oneinfiltrating ‘tribe’. Mengele was only one of hundreds of Nazi scientists andgeneticists brought to the United States after the war through Archon channelslike the Roman Church to continue their ‘work’. These were the people thatestablished NASA (NAZI) and they were also the brains behind the infamous USmind control programme called MKUltra. ‘MK’ stood for mind control, but theyused the Germany spelling of Kontrolle in deference to the relocated Nazis whowere behind it. Joseph Mengele was a frontline player in MKUltra and its eliteoffshoot, Project Monarch, and used the covername of Dr Green. One of hisregular locations was the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California, whichis a massive underground facility. Arizona Wilder was one of Mengele’s ‘assets’and she suffered unimaginable torture and abuse. You can see hours of interviewwith her entitled Confessions of a Mother Goddess which you will find atDavidicke.com [http://www.Davidicke.com]. She reveals many famous names that shesays she saw shapeshift into reptilian form at bloodline rituals. Among thoseshe listed are Mengele himself and also the Queen; the Queen Mother; PrincePhilip; Prince Charles; Princess Margaret; Father George Bush; his sons, BoyGeorge and Jeb Bush; Jay Rockefeller; Presidents Gerald Ford and Lyndon Johnson(who was implicated in the assassination of JFK which allowed him to becomepresident); former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright; and British PrimeMinister Tony Blair. Arizona also names many Rothschilds as shapeshifters,including the late Baron Guy de Rothschild. All these names were familiar to meand cross-referenced with other sources that said the same.Arizona said that she attended a ritual at the late Queen Mother’s residence atClarence House near Buckingham Palace in July 1981in the run up to Diana’sritual marriage to Prince Charles. Diana was virtually imprisoned at ClarenceHouse before her wedding so she couldn’t escape and it is now the London home ofPrince Charles. The Queen Mother was the personification of the satanicprinciple of inversion. She had the reputation before she died at the age of 102in 2002 of being the ‘nation’s grandmother’, but Diana told her long-time friendChristine Fitzgerald that the Queen Mother was ‘evil’ (Fig 356). Christine toldme: ‘She actually used that word, evil. She said that she hated the Queen Motherand the Queen Mother hated her.’ I have heard from a number of insider sourcesover the years that the Queen Mother was an extremely high-level satanic witchwho was involved in some of the major rituals in Europe. The Duke of Windsor whoabdicated the British throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson wasquoted in the mainstream media as saying of the Queen Mother: ‘Behind that greatabundance of charm is a shrewd, scheming and extremely ruthless woman.’ Hiswife, the then Duchess of Windsor, added: ‘Somebody once told me that evenHitler was afraid of her.’ That makes sense given that the Queen Mother was highin the satanic hierarchy of which Hitler was merely a pawn. Arizona said thatthe Clarence House ritual was in accordance with satanic ‘law’ and was called‘The Awakening of the Bride’. She said that those in attendance included theQueen Mother, the Queen, Prince Philip, Diana’s grandmother Lady Fermoy (who Isaid earlier manipulated Diana into the marriage in connivance with her closefriend the Queen Mother), Diana’s Satanist ‘father’ Earl Spencer, Prince Charlesand Camilla Parker-Bowles. Arizona said that Diana was brought in wearing awhite gown and then given a drug by Lady Fermoy, the mother of Diana’sRothschild mother. Arizona said that Diana was told that she should consider hermarriage to Charles as a means only to produce children and both the Queen andPrince Phillip shapeshifted into reptilian form to show her who they reallywere. Arizona said that Diana was ‘terrified, but quiet’, and she was told thatif she ever revealed this truth she would be killed. According to Arizona, theQueen Mother told Diana at the ritual that ‘all ears’ would be listening toeverything she said and ‘all eyes’ would forever be watching. Credo Mutwa, anexpert in the legends of the Chitauri, said that he received a call from Dianain March 1997, a few months before she died in August, in which she asked foradvice on how to reveal information about the royals that would ‘shake theworld’. He told me that he was bewildered with the call because there seemed tobe a lot of people in the background. Christine Fitzgerald said that when Diananeeded a call to be private (her phones were all tapped) she would go indisguise to a phone at a department store near her home at Kensington Palace.Arizona described how the Clarence House ritual involved the use of a goldenpenis which was used on Diana to signify the ‘opening of the womb’. Arizona saidthat it was reptilian in shape and size and had needle-like protrusions topuncture the walls of the vagina and cause bleeding. Diana was told that shewould never be ‘honoured’ again by attending their rituals and she was not toask questions about them. I met Diana shortly after her marriage to Charles atSt Paul’s Cathedral, the ancient Roman site of Goddess Diana worship, when sheattended the set of a television programme that I was co-presenting. I was takenaback and bewildered by the terrified look in her eyes. Years later, I realisedwhy. Arizona Wilder said the following about her experiences at rituals with themajor royals, as quoted in The Biggest Secret before the Queen Mother died:[../Images/00065.jpg]Figure 356: Behind the painted smile this was ‘a serious piece of wizardry’.[../Images/00316.jpg]Figure 357: Not in a dark alley comes to mind.> The Queen Mother: ‘She’s cold, cold, cold, a nasty person.

I remember her> pushing a knife into someone’s rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed.> One was 13 and the other 18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears> to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a reptilian she becomes> very tall and strong. Some of them are so strong they can rip out a heart and> they all grow by several feet when they shape-shift.’ [This is what the> Burnham Beeches lady said about Edward Heath – it’s a common theme.]> The Queen: ‘I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink> their blood. One time she got so excited with blood lust that she didn’t cut> the victim’s throat from left to right in the normal ritual, she just went> crazy, stabbing and ripping at the flesh after she’d shape-shifted into a> reptilian. When she shape-shifts she has a long reptile face, almost like a> beak, and she’s an off-white colour [the Draco ‘royal’ Archon-Reptilians are> said to be white, or albino]. The Queen Mother looks basically the same, but> there are differences. [The Queen] also has like bumps on her head and her> eyes are very frightening. She’s very aggressive’ (Fig 357).> Prince Charles: ‘I’ve seen him shape-shift into a reptilian and do all the> things the Queen does. I have seen him sacrifice children.

When Andrew> shape-shifts, he looks more like one of the lizards. The royals are some of> the worst, okay, as far as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and> eating the flesh, they’re some of the worst of all of them.

They feel that it is their birthright and they love it.> They love it.’Author, researcher and Montauk Project survivor Stewart Swerdlow similarlydescribes the satanic-reptilian rituals that he was forced to attend. He tellshow they eat babies and foetuses, many of which are supplied through Archonbloodline-controlled abortion clinics in the same way that they are suppliedwith human blood from the blood banks they control. Once again it is all aboutenergy and the infusion of the human genetic code contained in the blood thatallows them to hold their human form by keeping open the human codes withintheir hybrid DNA. Stewart said:> They also had live babies that they held up by the back of the neck. Then,> they slashed its throat from left to right, ear to ear, biting down on the> gaping opening to drink the blood. This was an amazing delicacy to them.Watch the 1998 Wesley Snipes movie Blade in which he plays a human-vampirehybrid that protects humans from vampires. The shapeshifters and blood ritualsin the film accurately portray what is happening for real and the British royalfamily is seriously involved. I know this will be hard to believe for mostpeople, but, hey, hard to believe does not mean that it isn’t true – it justmeans that the minds that can’t believe it can’t believe it and nothing more.Truth does not manifest from belief; perception of truth manifests from belief.The long conversations that I had with Diana’s close friend for nine years, thehealer Christine Fitzgerald, confirm the themes described by Arizona Wilder.Christine told me in 1998 about the way Diana was drugged and appallinglytreated and the information came from Diana and many other sources. She said:> The Queen Mother ... now that’s a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother> is a lot older than people think. To be honest, the Royal Family hasn’t died> for a long time, they have just metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in> a different way.

They are just in awe of these people because they are so powerful.[../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 358: Balmoral in Scotland is a location for major Archontic rituals.> Balmoral [the Queen’s castle in Scotland] is a very, very nasty place (Fig> 358).

But I want an end to the> bullshit.[../Images/00049.jpg]Figure 359: Prince Philip, the power behind the throne.Christine also said that Diana told her that the Queen Mother and Prince Philipwere the power behind the Windsors, not the Queen (Fig 359). This is because thehybrid-hierarchy is dictated by the Archon-Reptilian satanic hierarchy and thepublic hierarchy of power is not the same as the satanic hierarchy. A Britishclinical psychologist has described Prince Philip as a man devoid of guilt,empathy and love – precisely the character traits of the royal and ‘El-ite’bloodlines worldwide that I have been exposing for nearly a quarter of acentury. They’re all like that. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, one of millions ofunofficial offspring of the family, mentioned Prince Philip in detailedcorrespondence with me:> At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe], Prince> Philip at the pinnacle. He stands, like most contemporary European monarchy,> in the Charlemagne, Merovingian, Aenean bloodline. But he is its current head.> I am certain that his maternal chromosomes are in the current ‘antichrist’> Nephilim. Prince Philip ... is the leading biological descendent of the> ‘Reptilians’, as you call them. Immediately below him are the males of my> family line [Rothschilds] like a court of ministers in charge of logistics and> operations. The current monarchs of The Netherlands, Spain, and some of the> old Austrian nobility [Habsburgs] are next in occult power and in the> conspiracy.[../Images/00149.jpg]Figure 360: The old guard prepares to move over.The Charlemagne, Merovingian and Aenean bloodlines are particularly ‘pure’ fromthe Archon-Reptilian perspective and I have explained their background in otherbooks. The Merovingian bloodline came to public prominence in works like TheHoly Blood and the Holy Grail and, in effect, its novel version, The Da VinciCode. Both in my view mixed some truth and valid themes with considerablequantities of misunderstanding and, in terms of the latter, complete tosh. Thereis an imminent changing of the guard coming as the old hierarchy that includesthe Queen and Prince Philip completes its tour of duty (Fig 360). The Queen is86 at the time of writing and Prince Philip is 91. In fact, have you noticed howthese people tend to live very long lives? The Queen Mother died at 102; QueenJuliana of the Netherlands died at 94; David Rockefeller is 97; Father GeorgeBush is 88; Henry Kissinger is 89; Yitzhak Shamir, the terrorist and formerPrime Minister of Israel, died at 96. How come so many of these people they liveso long? Why? Because they have a different genetic program and they replenishthemselves by drinking the blood (life force) of children. I have been sayingfor years that this replenishes the body and while I was writing this bookresearchers at Stanford University laboratories announced that a study involvingmice had shown that injections of youthful blood have ‘semimagical, rejuvenatingqualities’. They said that if the same is true of humans (it is) this coulddelay aging and restore the hearts of the elderly to health. Another factor inthe long lives of so many of these people is that they don’t have the samemedical treatment that the rest of the population do. Oil tycoon J D Rockefellerwas at the forefront of imposing drug and scalpel medicine on the world but diedat the age of 97 with his personal homeopath at his bedside.I have no doubt there are others in the shadows that are higher in the hybridhierarchy than the British and European royals, but they are certainly thepublic face."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00043.jpg]Archon PaedophiliaNothing strengthens authority so much as silence.Leonardo da VinciSatanism is at the top of the Archon Control System hierarchy and this connectsin the overall network with a rings-within-rings structure in which Satanism,the upper levels of the major and most exclusive secret societies, RothschildZionism and the paedophile networks operate as one unit.Why paedophile networks? The answer is the same as the question of why Satanistssacrifice so many children going back thousands of years under the code of‘young virgins’. The Demiurge-Archons want the energy of children more thananything. Puberty is perceived to be a time of hormonal change when a childbecomes an adult, but the hormonal is the holographic expression of energeticchange in the waveform construct. The vampire predators want the energy ofchildren before that change takes place – that is before puberty. This is thereason for the obsession with child sexual abuse and sacrifice worldwide and itsbreathtaking scale, and why incredible numbers of people in power are bothSatanists and paedophiles. Don Juan Matus, the shaman source for the CarlosCastaneda books, highlighted this. Castaneda wrote:> ... [Don Juan] explained that sorcerers saw infant human beings as strange> luminous balls of energy, covered from the top to the bottom with a glowing> coat, something like a coat of plastic adjusted tightly around the cocoon of> energy. He said that glowing coat of awareness was what the predators consumed> and that when a human reached adulthood, all that was left of that fringe> awareness was a narrow fringe that went from the ground to the top of the> toes. That fringe permitted mankind to keep on living, but only barely.The other-dimensional Archontic vampires absorb the energy of children when theyare sacrificed and when they are being sexually abused by the paedophiles theArchons possess. They stimulate in the paedophile the desire for sex withchildren and while it is happening the possessing Archons are drawing off thechild’s energy through the paedophile conduit. The Archon-paedophile-childenergetic ‘channel’ also allows for demonic possession. This is how children ofthe hybrid bloodlines are possessed at an early age and it is one reason whypaedophilia and incest are the norm in this network. The bloodlines have beendoing this for so long that the desire for sex with children is encoded in theirvery RNA/DNA. Widespread paedophilia is insurance for the Archons that sex withchildren will continue generation after generation and so ensure a continuingsupply of children’s energy. The Roman Catholic Church and other religions aremajor centres for possessed paedophiles and so are children’s homes and theironically-named child protection services which are kidnapping ever morechildren from loving parents for the most outrageous and spurious reasons andare awarded government financial incentives to do so. Many of these childrenstolen by the state end up as victims of the paedophile and Satanic rings –Saturn rings – that infiltrate and control the children’s homes and childprotection networks. Figures from the National Center for Missing and ExploitedChildren reveal that 60 percent of runaway victims of sex trafficking in the UShave been in the custody of child protective services and a 2011 audit foundthat the addresses of more than 1000 registered sex offenders matched those oflicensed foster-care facilities and homes in the Sacramento area alone. Howcould anyone systematically do this to children, even their own children? Theyare devoid of empathy. They are Satanists. They are Archons. They are bonkers.Children, even girls, are mostly abused through anal sex to access the lowerchakra at the base of the spine and because the act of anal penetration triggersnerves at the base of the spine which are communicated via the spinal cord tothe brain to cause certain neurological changes that create the compartments oralters. Alter-switching caused many victims that I have met to believethemselves to be virgins before the memories of sex with hundreds of men cameflooding back later in life. The lower chakra connects with the reptilian brainat the other end of the spinal cord and this is the chakra that ‘grounds’ us inthis reality. When the base chakra is scrambled and distorted (which anal sexwith children is designed to do) people can be condemned to a lifetime ofaimlessness, a lack of connection to the manifest world and perceived threats tosurvival. The base chakra is called the root chakra and when it does notproperly ground us we become ‘rootless’, a state that is reflected in whathappens in everyday life. Abused children who have experienced anal sex, even ifthey don’t remember because of ‘alter’ compartmentalisation, can suffer theconsequences of an ongoing suppressed rage, known by some as the ‘sodomy rage’.All of these imbalances can be corrected, but who in ‘The System’ is going tohelp these people to do this when they are either perpetrators themselves (thefew) or clueless about all this (the rest of them)? The term ‘sodomy’, by theway, comes from the Biblical Sodom, a centre for sex magic and blood sacrifice.Still today many rabbis suck the blood from the penis of circumcised babies.It’s okay, though. That’s what the ‘Lord’ (Demiurge) wants, you see.Doorway to the cesspitI have been exposing national and global paedophile, mind control and satanicrings since the mid-1990s and many of their most famous names includingpaedophile President and serial killer Father George Bush and Rothschild Zionistagent Henry Kissinger. I exposed the political paedophilia in the United Statesin The Biggest Secret, first published in 1998, along with major political namesin the UK like the paedophile, mass child-killer and Satanist Prime MinisterEdward ‘black eyes’ Heath who was providing the conduit for his hidden mastersto vampire the energy of his child victims. These interlocking rings involvepeople in all walks of life from politics, law enforcement, judiciary, banking,corporations and media, and they watch each other’s backs because their ownbacks depend upon it. Children’s homes and government mind control programmesare the major source of children for the American ‘elite’. High on the list isBoys Town, Nebraska, which is also known as ‘Father Flanagan’s Boys’ Home’ afterits founder, Roman Catholic priest Father Edward J Flanagan. He established BoysTown in 1921 for the ‘care, treatment, and education of at-risk children’. Ifyou read the book, The Franklin Cover Up, by former Nebraska state senator, JohnW DeCamp, you might wonder when the children are most ‘at risk’ – before they goto Boys Town or after. DeCamp set out to investigate a financial scam being runby a man called Lawrence King at the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha but thendiscovered that King was also running a paedophile ring supplying children tothe rich and famous, especially in the Republican Party although there are no‘parties’ with paedophilia – it infests all political parties. King was such aRepublican insider that he sang the national anthem at the party conventions in1984 and 1988. The story, or offshoots of the real story, broke briefly in amainstream newspaper at one point but was then swiftly covered up as usual (Fig361). The most extensive example of what happens in every country was providedby the exposure of the secret life of a famous British ‘entertainer’, JimmySavile, who made his name with the BBC (Fig 362). Christine Fitzgerald, thefriend of Princess Diana, told me during our conversations in the late 1990sthat Savile was a paedophile and necrophiliac (one who has sex with deadbodies). She explained how Savile was a member of the Windsors’ inner circle andhow Diana couldn’t stand him because he was so creepy. I did what I could tocirculate this information but I was still being dismissed as usual when Irepeated these facts at the time of his death, aged 84, in 2011; but thefollowing year a television documentary on the ITV station talked to women whoclaimed that Savile had abused them as children and wham the floodgates opened.Within weeks 450 people of both sexes had made complaints about Savile involving28 police areas throughout the country and among them were 34 alleged rapes.They spanned a period of 54 years between 1955 and 2009 when Savile was 82. Theabuses happened to 23 children and young people on BBC premises and at 14hospitals and at least one hospice. More than 70 percent of his victims wereunder 18 and one as young as eight. This is fantastic enough, but the fulltruth, which has been covered by police up at the time of writing, is even moreshocking and involves the British royal family and the highest levels of thepolitical system. It is clear that Savile was well known as a paedophile by manypolice officers and BBC employees throughout most of his decades of child abuse,but he was protected by ‘The System’ because he was providing children forpaedophiles that run ‘The System’. I am going to use the Savile story to showhow the rings operate worldwide and please remember if you don’t live in Britainthat exactly the same is happening in your country.[../Images/00235.jpg]Figure 361: The tip of a global iceberg.[../Images/00546.jpg]Figure 362: Jimmy Savile ... he fixed it for the rich and famous.Jimmy Savile was considered for decades to be a British ‘icon’ and ‘nationaltreasure’. He was one of the first in the entertainment field known as ‘discjockeys’ who emerged with the 1960s music and cultural explosion known as the‘Swinging Sixties’. I remember him appearing on television shows when I was akid, still in black and white then, and in fact you could hardly miss him. Onceseen, never forgotten. He would always appear with dyed hair, mostly blond, andhighly colourful and eccentric clothing accompanied by multiple rings and otherjewellery. Savile was what they called a ‘one-off’, a ‘character’ and peopleeither loved him or deeply loathed him and thought he was seriously weird. Therewas little of the half-way about Jimmy Savile. He began as a disc jockey indance halls and later managed several of them before he launched a career in themedia via the legendary Radio Luxemburg in 1958 and eventually moved to the BBCwhich was to be his prime public platform for decades. He was a first and lastpresenter of the ground-breaking music chart show Top of the Pops, which ranfrom 1964 to 2006, but his biggest claim to fame was the BBC show Jim’ll Fix Itwhich he presented from 1975 to 1994. This is particularly relevant because itwas a programme in which children wrote in to describe what they would most liketo do or who they would most like to meet. The programme then ‘fixed it’ for thechildren chosen to take part. The ‘fix’ could be anything from going up in a hotair balloon to meeting their favourite pop star. Savile was also famous for hischarity work which included running many marathons. He was a volunteer porter atthe Leeds General Infirmary; a volunteer and fundraiser at Stoke MandevilleHospital with its world famous spinal injuries unit; and he was involved withthe Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital where many infamous killershave spent their days. Savile is reported to have had his own room at both StokeMandeville and Broadmoor and it was revealed that he was given his own set ofkeys that allowed him access to many areas within the psychiatric hospital. Hispublic face was of a jolly and eccentric character who was famous for histrademark expensive cigar and constantly-repeated catch-phrases such as ‘how’sabout that, then?’, ‘now then, now then’, ‘goodness gracious’, ‘as it ‘appens’and ‘guys and gals’. But away from the screen Savile lived a very different lifeand operated in very different circles to the ‘man of the people’ image that heso cultivated and it is now clear that much of his charity work was designed togive him access to children, below-age teenagers and dead bodies in hospitalmortuaries. Savile was the most classic incarnate Archon with his obsession withthe energy of children and death. Savile’s fellow BBC radio presenter PaulBurnett said without knowing the significance: ‘He did a lot of work as a porterin the [Leeds] hospital that he collected money for. He would go there at nightand work as a porter.’ Yes, and what else? Gradually, as the Savile storyexpanded, more truth came out and Savile’s BBC contemporary, Paul Gambaccini,confirmed that Savile was a necrophiliac. What Christine Fitzgerald told me allthose years ago turned out to be 100 percent accurate and remember what else shetold me about Diana and the reptilian nature of the Windsors. Savile was given ahero’s funeral before all this came out which shows so clearly how even the mostextreme of these paedophiles, Satanists and killers can cover up theiractivities thanks to the paedophiles and Satanists behind the State machine. Ihave been saying for decades that paedophilia and Satanism are fundamentallyconnected and the cement that holds the system together, and so it was nosurprise when stories emerged of Savile’s Satanism. The UK Daily Expressreported how Savile had raped a 12-year-old girl in a satanic ritual at StokeMandeville Hospital in 1975. Dr Valerie Sinason, director of the Clinic forDissociative Studies in London, told the paper how one of her clients haddescribed what happened. Dr Sinason said:> She recalled being led into a room that was filled with candles on the lowest> level of the hospital, somewhere that was not regularly used by staff. Several> adults were there, including Jimmy Savile who, like the others, was wearing a> robe and a mask. She recognised him because of his distinctive voice and the> fact that his blond hair was protruding from the side of the mask. He was not> the leader but he was seen as important because of his fame.> She was molested, raped and beaten and heard words that sounded like ‘Ave> Satanas’, a Latinised version of ‘Hail Satan’, being chanted. There was no> mention of any other child being there and she cannot remember how long the> attack lasted but she was left extremely frightened and shaken.Dr Sinason also said that a second Savile victim contacted her in 1993 todescribe how she had been ‘lent out’ at a party in a London house in 1980:> The first part of the evening started off with an orgy but half-way through> some of the participants left. Along with other young women, the victim was> shepherded to wait in another room before being brought back to find Savile in> a master of ceremonies kind of role with a group wearing robes and masks.> She too heard Latin chanting and instantly recognised Satanist regalia.> Although the girl was a young adult, who was above the age of consent, she had> suffered a history of sexual abuse and was extremely vulnerable.Both of these Satanically-abused witnesses went to the police, but no action wastaken. The extent of Savile’s operations and the nature of his rich and powerfulassociates make him a doorway into the cesspit that I have been exposing for solong.Savile and the royalsSavile himself would boast about his connections to the royals and it waspublicly acknowledged that he was a regular visitor to Buckingham Palace,Kensington Palace (where Princess Diana lived after her marriage ended withPrince Charles), and Highgrove (the country estate of Prince Charles). ChristineFitzgerald told me how Savile had been a close friend of Prince Philip untilthey had fallen out after a ‘big row’. Savile told Esquire magazine about hisinvolvement with the royal family: ‘The thing about me is I get things done andI work deep cover. I’ve known the Royal Family for a million years.’ Accordingto the UK Daily Mail at the time of Savile’s death, he was ‘used as anintermediary in an attempt to resolve the differences between the Prince andPrincess of Wales shortly before their split’ (Fig 363). Savile said that he wasinvited to regular meetings with the royal family because ‘I have a natural goodfun way of going on and we have a laugh’ (Fig 364). Would one of the world’smost powerful families invite an aging disc jockey into their inner sanctum sooften just because he gave them ‘a good laugh’? Or is there likely to be a farmore plausible reason for their strange closeness? Oh yes. I have been writingsince the 1990s about the royal family’s connection to Satanism and paedophilia– just as I told those who would listen about Jimmy Savile; but all I had for mytrouble from mainstream society was ridicule and dismissal. Minds were tooclosed and too programmed to make the leap into the world as it really is. Now,in the wake of the public confirmation about Savile, it is time that they did.How many more children need to suffer before humanity grows up and faces thereality and sheer evil of the force that controls them and their reality? JimmySavile and the royal family shared a love of Scotland and the sporting eventsknown as the Highland Games. Savile was the Honorary Chieftain of the LochaberHighland Games which he attended for 30 years. He had a secluded cottage atnearby Glencoe where Prince Charles was a visitor (Fig 365). Savile said after avisit by Charles in 1999: ‘I’ve had a few noshups with the royals and I thoughtit was time I returned the hospitality.’ Charles sent a Christmas card to Savilein which he wrote: ‘Jimmy, with affectionate greetings from Charles. Give mylove to your ladies in Scotland.’ The reference to the ‘ladies’ was meant forthe scantily-clad women that Savile had arranged to serve lunch for the Princeduring a visit to the Glencoe cottage. Charles also gave him cigars and goldcufflinks for his 80th birthday and included a note which said: ‘Nobody willever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way inthanking you for that.’ Savile said that he had first been introduced to theroyal family in 1966 by (known paedophile) Lord Louis Mountbatten, the royalrelative and mentor of both Prince Philip and Prince Charles (Fig 366).Mountbatten was Commandant General of the Royal Marines and arranged for thedisc jockey to become the first civilian to be awarded the Marines’ Green Beret.It was one of a many ‘honours’ that Savile would be awarded in the years thatfollowed. Savile said:[../Images/00500.jpg]Figure 363: Savile with Charles and Diana – she couldn’t stand him.[../Images/00445.jpg]Figure 364: The unlikely alliance ... so why the close relationship?[../Images/00192.jpg]Figure 365: Charles and Savile – the Scotland connection.[../Images/00530.jpg]Figure 366: Paedophile Mountbatten and his protégés.> Coming from Lord Louis, who was the favourite uncle of Prince Philip, that was> quite something. So obviously I hooked up with the Prince – what was good> enough for Lord Louis was good enough for him.This is no surprise given that the British royal family, like all the royalbloodlines of Europe and further afield, are founded on Satanism, paedophiliaand the manipulation of occult knowledge for deeply malevolent ends in leaguewith the ‘dark suit’ expressions of the bloodlines in politics, banking,corporations and media. The biggest story is not even of Savile’srecord-breaking paedophilia, but that his incredible closeness to royalty andthe upper echelons of British politics was because he was a supplier of childrento these rich and famous ‘clients’. His connections fanned out across thespectrum of human society and the victims of his abuse that have spoken out inthe wake of the television documentary are only part of a gigantic web ofpaedophilia, Satanism, drug-running and murder in which he was involved. Idescribe him as a ‘doorway to the cesspit’ because if you get past him and hisfake persona you enter the sick and depraved world of the global Archonbloodline El-ite. Savile was a ‘fixer’ – he described himself as such, thoughnot in terms of what he was really fixing. As he told Esquire: ‘The thing aboutme is I get things done and I work deep cover.’ His most famous TV programme,Jim’ll Fix It, could not have been more appropriately named. One of Savile’snephews, Guy Marsden, now in his 60s, has said publicly that he and his friendswere taken to parties by his uncle in the late 1960s to ‘act as intermediariesfor adults and younger children’. He said that the parties were attended by‘household names’ in show business, but only men – never women. Marsden, then13, and some friends from Leeds in the north of England, ran away to London for‘an adventure’, he said. They were approached by men at Euston railway stationand invited to a grubby flat. Then about four days later Savile turned up at theflat by coincidence because, as Marsden soon learned, his famous uncle mixedwith ‘fellow child molesters’. He said he thought he would be in trouble forrunning away and not telling his parents where he was, but instead his UncleJimmy just took him and his friends to a ‘much better place’ – the house of a‘famous pop impresario’ which had a big indoor swimming pool and was one venuefor Savile’s ‘paedophile parties’. Marsden said that little boys and girls woulddisappear into bedrooms with the famous attendees and it was ‘perfectly obvious’what was happening. ‘You heard sounds and moans and groans coming from thebedroom and knew what was going on.’ Marsden added:> At night you would get about 15 or 20 people turning up. There would be music> and tables full of food, we couldn’t believe it. There was everything we> needed and we just hung around.> At first we automatically assumed the children lived there, but we soon> realised they didn’t. They would be brought there, sometimes by Uncle Jimmy,> and would stay for six or seven hours until 3 or 4am. They were just little> kids, boys and girls.Significantly, Marsden said that Savile sometimes arrived with a man dressed asa priest and he believed that children being abused may have come from anorphanage or children’s home. They almost certainly did – it fits the modusoperandi of the paedophile rings to the letter. What better way to supply yourchildren than have control of children’s homes? Several of Savile’s victims whocame forward say they were abused by him at the Duncroft boarding school for‘intelligent, emotionally disturbed girls’ in Surrey and wherever children andyoung people are gathered together in a boarding situation needs to be watchedlike a hawk. These establishments are the predators’ hunting grounds with oftentheir own people appointed to the staff. The public revelations about Savilehave been confined largely to his abuse of underage girls and the truth aboutthe way he supplied girls and boys for people like Prime Minister Edward Heath,the royals and so many others is being suppressed, at least at the time ofwriting. One of Savile and Heath’s major haunts was the infamous Haut de laGarenne children’s ‘care’ home on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands.Jersey is the fiefdom of mega-rich and mega-crooked networks that combinecriminal business, banking and drug operations with paedophilia and Satanism.The island of Jersey, off the French coast, is only nine miles by five with apopulation of 90,000 and yet has 55 banks, more than 33,000 registered companiesand hundreds of billions of dollars on deposit. It is a money-launderingoperation of global proportions and attracts the super wealthy with low taxrates. Haut de la Garenne, or ‘Forest Heights’, was a ‘children’s home’(detention centre) from 1867 to 1986 and it is clear that it played the role ofproviding children for sexual and violent abuse by the Jersey Mafia in all itsforms – as well as the El-lite of mainland Britain, including members of theRoyal Family. Jersey has an almost self-contained government of its own, but theQueen remains at the top of its power structure and wherever the ‘Crown’ holdssway so does Satanism and child abuse. The infamous Satanist Edward Paisnel, whowas dubbed ‘The Beast of Jersey’ after being jailed for 30 years for the rape ofboys and girls, used to play Father Christmas at Haut de la Garenne in the1960s.Savile and HeathA high-profile police investigation began in 2008 into historic long-term abuseat the home and, unfortunately for those involved, a decent, honest copper wasin control of the investigation. This was Lenny Harper, a States of Jerseypolice detective who led a three-year child abuse inquiry that genuinely triedto expose what happened. Genuine police officers and detectives who sought thetruth in the Marc Dutroux child abuse and murder scandal in Belgium in the 1990sfound that refusing to cover up the facts is not a good career move for lawenforcement personnel if the truth leads to rich, famous and powerful people andtheir networks. So it proved again with the Jersey investigation. Both sets ofgenuine investigators in Jersey and Belgium were removed from these cases andany credible ‘investigation’ went with them. Lenny Harper, like his counterpartin the Belgian inquiry, was accused of ‘misconduct’ as a blatant excuse to getrid of him and the allegations were later proved to be false. Harper’s boss,Jersey police chief Graham Power, was also outrageously suspended andneutralised as part of the cover-up. A number of police officers in the mainlandUK have told how they were taken off cases or accused of misconduct when theybegan to uncover political paedophiles. These included Detective Chief InspectorClive Driscoll who told the Daily Mirror how he faced disciplinary action whenhe mentioned the names in a private meeting of alleged paedophile politiciansabusing children in Lambeth, London. He said: ‘There were allegations made byseveral people that named politicians had been involved but I never had a chanceto investigate them because I was moved before I could do so.’ Once he was movedfrom Lambeth the ‘disciplinary’ action was dropped. Anna Tapsell, chairwoman ofLambeth’s social services committee, said that when she questioned thecommitment of the police to investigate the Lambert paedophile ring a policeofficer arrived at her home to ‘warn her off’. This is how the system protectsits own at the expense of children. More than a hundred people came forwardclaiming to have been sexually and violently abused at the Jersey home and LennyHarper has confirmed that Jimmy Savile’s name appeared early in hisinvestigation but with not enough evidence to charge him at the time. Saviledenied any knowledge of ever being at the home, but a picture surfaced of himthere to show that he was lying (Fig 367). Highly significantly, the name ofEdward Heath, the British Prime Minister between 1970 and 1974, also emerged inrelation to abuse at Haut de la Garenne and to Jimmy Savile. I named Heath as aserial child abuser, killer and Satanist in The Biggest Secret seven yearsbefore he died in 2005. A local newspaper reporter, or an excuse for one,contacted Heath days after the book was published in 1998 and read him thepassage. He replied with the usual ‘Icke is crazy’ response and did nothingelse. The reporter, a Charlotte Hofton, condemned me for attacking a ‘nice oldman’. Maybe she was too focused on her property portfolio. Her paper must payher a tidy sum. I had spoken to many people who said they had been abused byHeath and witnessed his sexual abuses and satanic child murders and no libelaction followed publication because what I wrote was true (Fig 368). Those whosurvived Heath’s abuse were the minority. He loved to torture children and thenkill them, often by cutting their throats. This was the man who ran Britain forhis masters for four years as prime minister and signed us into the fascism thatis the European Union. Heath was famous as an ocean-going sailor in a series ofyachts named Morning Cloud which he used to sail to Jersey and Jimmy Savilesupplied the children who would be abused at sea and never return. Myinformation from the 1990s was confirmed in early 2013 by barrister MichaelShrimpton, a former immigration judge and now an Intelligence and nationalsecurity consultant. Shrimpton has an extensive Intelligence background bothsides of the Atlantic and he has written a book called Spyhunter. He said in aninterview on community radio that Heath was a paedophile who murdered his youngboy victims, or had others do it, often by throwing them into the sea after hehad abused them on his yachts – one in particular that won the Sydney to Hobartrace and then sank off Jersey in 1974 after Heath had sold it to a Jerseyresident. Shrimpton said, as I had, that Savile supplied boys for Heath and manyof them were from the Jersey home. Shrimpton went on:[../Images/00121.jpg]Figure 367: Savile poses for a picture with children at Haut de la Garenne whichhe said he had never visited.[../Images/00426.jpg]Figure 368: Edward Heath on Jim’ll Fix It with the man who supplied many of hisabused and murdered children.> There are people who are still alive who are involved in the paedophile> scandal and obviously I am not going to name them on a radio programme but the> most prominent paedophile associated with the Savile ring was a man called> Edward Heath who you may recall was Prime Minister.> Heath was recruited by the Germans in 1937, I have said this in Spyhunter.> Heath was into little boys and Savile was supplying them. A number of these> boys were taken out the Haut de la Garenne in Jersey. Savile was taking> children from a children’s home with support of German assets in Jersey.My own view is that the ‘German’ networks that Shrimpton talks about werecontrolled in the background, just like Britain, Russia, and the United Statesetc., by the Rothschilds and their lackeys. The same is true of the Naziscientists, engineers, geneticists and mind controllers sent to the UnitedStates after the war under the codename Operation Paperclip to set up NASA, themind control programme MKUltra, and much else. Germany has been a Rothschildfiefdom since the occult family called Bauer changed their name to Rothschild inthe 18th century and it is also used as a conduit for their activities by theVatican wing of the conspiracy, the Jesuits, Knights of Malta, Knights Templarand Opus Dei. Jimmy Savile was a Knight of Malta. Shrimpton said that policeinvestigator Lenny Harper could not find any graves of lost children near theJersey home because there weren’t any:> The boys were in fact being taken to a boat, it happened to be Edward Heath’s> boat or yacht and they were murdered and thrown overboard so there is no point> sadly in looking for their grave ... they don’t have any grave except the sea.> That’s why the BBC and the Cabinet Office have been so keen to protect Savile;> that is why the Cabinet Office in the 1980s were willing to back Savile to the> point of giving him a position of authority at Broadmoor [the high-security> psychiatric hospital] ... you don’t put a paedophile in charge of Broadmoor.> It’s like putting a lunatic in charge of the asylum or a drunk in charge of a> brewery or David Cameron in charge of a government ...Shrimpton rightly said that Lenny Harper was a very competent and verycourageous police officer who was up against a Cabinet Office-backed paedophilering and the investigation that he was conducting was at some professional risk.> ... Indeed I suspect his life was also at risk at one point because he was> getting close to some very uncomfortable truths about people in the Cabinet> Office, GO2 [British Intelligence] in London and certain people in Jersey in> the German network.[../Images/00441.jpg]Figure 369: Savile with Pope John Paul II.Shrimpton says that Heath’s paedophilia and murder of children was covered up byhis Cabinet Secretary John Hunt, Baron Hunt of Tanworth, who Shrimpton says wasalso a paedophile. There are interesting parallels between Hunt and Savile. Huntwas appointed by the Queen to be a Companion, Knight Commander and Knight GrandCross of the British Order of Chivalry known as The Most Honourable Order of theBath of which the Queen is the head and Prince Charles the Grand Master. Huntwas also given a Papal Knighthood by Pope John Paul II and so was Jimmy Savilewho was also knighted by the Queen (Fig 369). The Roman Church is the biggestpaedophile operation on the planet which, as the Archontic Church of Babylonrelocated, it was always going to be. Savile was also a staunch supporter ofIsrael and a Rothschild Zionist who described himself as ‘the most JewishCatholic you will ever meet’. But was he a Jewish Catholic or a Catholic Jew? Heclaimed to have berated the Israeli cabinet in 1975 for being ‘too soft’ withArabs after the Six-Day War and lived in the heart of the Jewish community inLeeds where he raised a considerable amount of money for Jewish causes. MichaelShrimpton highlighted a fact that I have come across constantly over the yearsand this is that children abused by famous people, especially in the worlds ofpolitics and royalty, are then killed to protect the identity of their abuser.Remember how the Australian Satanist document said that ‘young children sexuallymolested and physically abused by politicians worldwide are quickly used assacrifices’ and that ‘in Australia, the bodies are hardly ever discovered, forAustralia is still a wilderness’. Shrimpton said:> If the children are and I am afraid with paedophilia we sometimes have babies> being abused but if you are not talking babies, you are talking toddlers who> are able to recognise the people that are abusing them ... since you are> talking about people who are on television, people who are high profile, you> have to murder the children in order to protect your asset.> So for the Germans [I would say Rothschilds] it was essential that the boys> ... were being taken onto the yacht [for] a death ride. When Jimmy Savile was> taking let’s say a fourteen year old boy down to Morning Cloud, handing him> over to Edward Heath or a member of the crew on the yacht, it was a death> ride, that was that boy’s last journey on earth because there was no way in> the world with him recognising Edward Heath that he could be allowed back on> shore and Savile must have known this ...Heath and Lord Mountbatten, who first introduced Savile to the royal family,have also been connected to the Kincora boys’ home in Belfast, Northern Ireland,the centre of another paedophile ring scandal that broke in 1980. It was clearthat the authorities knew what was going on for years before that, but didnothing. Kincora was a home for working class boys, the very type of kids thatMountbatten was said to be most keen to abuse. Kincora children would also betaken to castles and other homes of the rich and aristocratic families, some ofwhom were connected to the Irish branch of the Hellfire Club. This is thesatanic network established in the 18th century by British politician andChancellor of the Exchequer, Francis Dashwood, 15th Baron le Despencer, and hisclose friend, American hero, Benjamin Franklin. Three members of staff atKincora were jailed, including William McGrath, a friend and associate ofNorthern Ireland’s most famous politician, Ian Paisley, but none of the El-iteclientele were ever investigated, let alone named and charged. The official‘inquiry’ (anything but) decided there was no wider ring operating from the homewhen that was clearly absurd and in March 2013 police announced a newinvestigation into what happened. It would be inexplicable that Jimmy Savile,this very strange and past-it disc jockey, would be so unbelievably close to theroyal family – right in the inner sanctum – unless you knew what he really didfor a living and that was procure children. Savile died extremely rich and noone seems to be asking where all that came from. Okay, he would have earned wellenough in his prime with television, advertising and personal appearances, buthe had done none of that with any serious earning capacity for a long time. Yethe still owned a £160,000 Rolls Royce and had five other cars including aBentley Turbo and Mercedes 500 SL. He is also reported to have owned at leasteight homes and left millions in his will on top of that. Where did all themoney come from into old age to keep that scale of lifestyle going? The answeris that child procurement for El-ite paedophiles is a very lucrative businessand also ensures you protection from the law so long as you keep the secretsbecause if you go down so do your clients. This is why Savile could boast thathe was untouchable. He told television presenter Louis Theroux: ‘I can getanything. There’s nothing I can’t get, and there’s nothing I can’t do.’ Thosewho stay quiet are protected. Those who threaten to speak out are soon dead. Thelatter was not going to happen to Savile who knew how the game worked and playedit for his personal benefit.Savile and ThatcherThe implications of his close relationship to the royal family equally apply tohis close friendship with the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with whom heclaims to have spent many New Year’s Eves during her more than a decade inoffice (Fig 370). It just so happens that the Thatcher government andConservative Party in the 1980s was alive with paedophilia as will be thepresent Conservative administration because they always are. The same applies tothe Labour and Liberal Democrat parties and their like around the world,including, no, especially, the Republicans and Democrats in the United States.Margaret Thatcher is highly likely to have been one of endless political leaderswho are covertly of the Archon bloodline. She is said to have come from a humblebackground as the daughter of a grocer in Grantham, Lincolnshire, but the latestresearch points to her mother being an unofficial offspring of a serious royalbloodline as a result of Thatcher’s grandmother, Phoebe Stephenson, beingimpregnated by the aristocracy while working as a housemaid at Belton House, the17th-century stately home near Grantham. As always, Thatcher did not come topower by accident to so significantly change events as she did – especiallyeconomically. Her puritanical father, the civic bigwig and Methodist preacher,Alfred Roberts, has been accused by a number of people of sexually abusing younggirls. Political biographer Professor Bernard Crick highlighted this andreported a Grantham friend as saying: ‘Older teachers all remembered theirdifficulty in trying ... to steer girls away from taking jobs at his shop. Theywere frightened to hint at the real reason, for he was a figure of real power inthe town.’ A 74-year old Grantham woman told the Independent on Sunday that shehad been frequently molested by Roberts at the age of 15 while working at hisshop. She said: ‘He was a bad one. He came round and put his arms around me,feeling my breasts. He used to put his tongue in my mouth. I got quitefrightened.’ Paedophile links to the Thatcher government began to emerge – withthe Savile revelations still in full flow – when Tom Watson, a Member ofParliament and Deputy Chairman of the opposition Labour Party, asked PrimeMinister David Cameron in a parliamentary question about a paedophile ringoperating out of Number 10 Downing Street during the reign of a previous unnamedprime minister. His question was connected to Peter Righton, a member of thevile Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), who was convicted in 1992 ofimporting and possessing illegal homosexual pornographic material. Righton was aformer consultant to the National Children’s Bureau and Director of Education atthe prestigious National Institute of Social Work in London. Tom Watson said inParliament:[../Images/00414.jpg]Figure 370: Savile with his close friend, Margaret Thatcher. Husband Denis wasalso a Savile pal.> The evidence file used to convict paedophile Peter Righton, if it still> exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring. One of> its members boasts of its links to a senior aide of a former Prime Minister> who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad.> The leads were not followed up but if the file still exists, I want to ensure> that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it, and> investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked> to Parliament and Number 10.Tom Watson said later that ‘a retired public servant had, through a quirk offate, stumbled on something that appeared so huge, that almost everyone he’dever raised his concerns with had baulked at the challenge’ and that ‘some ofthose powerful people involved in a cover-up may well have been – and couldstill be – powerful politicians’. Watson continued in a posting on his website:> Since then though, many more ordinary people have contacted me about> suspicions they have had of a wider wrongdoing – in some cases so heinous it> made me cry. They have talked of psychopaths marking children with Stanley> knifes to show ‘ownership’. They tell of parties where children were ‘passed> around’ the men.

Others have identified a former> cabinet minister who regularly abused young boys. Some have raised mysterious> early deaths, disappeared children, suspicious fires, intimidation and> threats. It’s bewildering.It certainly can be, but I have been researching this subject for nearly twodecades and what Watson said all makes perfect sense to me. Watson’s publicstatement was then followed by very weird behaviour by the BBC over an interviewfor the current affairs programme, Newsnight, with an abuse-victim called SteveMessham who was one a stream of children abused at ‘care’ homes in North Walesin the 1970s and 1980s. Children’s homes and ‘care’ homes are the main source ofchildren for the rings and child procurer Jimmy Savile has been connected to theNorth Wales abuse scandal, as he has to others like Haut de la Garenne. It is anational and international ring and so homes are involved all over the countryas abuse victims have indeed confirmed. A member of the production organisationbehind Steve Messham’s Newsnight interview – not directly employed by the BBC –began to circulate on the Internet that Newsnight was likely to name a seniorpolitical figure that evening as a child abuser. Iain Overton, editor of theself-styled ‘independent, not-for-profit’ Bureau of Investigative Journalismwhich led the Newsnight ‘investigation’, said: ‘If all goes well we’ve got aNewsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile’.Overton’s actions began a frenzy of activity on the Internet speculating on whoit could be, but when the programme aired that night the interview with SteveMessham did not include the name of the person that he was talking about and wasonly an account of his alleged deeply disturbing experiences with this person.Naturally the speculation became even more frenetic and in the days thatfollowed the name of very close Thatcher aide and former Conservative PartyTreasurer Lord Alistair McAlpine was widely mentioned on the Internet bymultiple sources. McAlpine, by then living in Italy, eventually made a publicstatement denying that he had abused anyone and threatening legal action againstthose who named him (Fig 371). McAlpine, a man of considerable wealth from thefamily of the McAlpine construction and civil engineering company, was veryspecific in his statement as he sought to counter the never-broadcast claims bySteve Messham that he was the abuser. He said that he had only once been to thelocation of much of Messham’s abuse, the main North Wales town of Wrexham. Hesaid that this single visit was to the local Constituency ConservativeAssociation on party business and he had been at all times accompanied by thenow dead Stuart Newman, an agent from Conservative Central Office. He said hedid not stay the night. Lord McAlpine had a well-known cousin who lived near toWrexham called James ‘Jimmie’ McAlpine, a man named to me as a serial paedophileby other victims of the North Wales abuse but never investigated by police. Afew miles down the road was the constituency of known paedophile Peter Morrison,the MP for Chester, who was, like Lord Alistair McAlpine, a member of MargaretThatcher’s most inner circle. Lord McAlpine said that he had never visited achildren’s home in North Wales, ‘nor have I ever visited any children’s home,reform school or any other institution of a similar nature.’ He added that hehad never stayed in a hotel in or near Wrexham, did not own a Rolls Royce, hadnever possessed a ‘Gold card’ or ‘Harrods card’ and never wore aftershave – allof which had been alleged of Messham’s attacker or attackers. ‘If he does thinkI am the man who abused him all those years ago I can only suggest that he ismistaken and that he has identified the wrong person’, McAlpine said. He thenthreatened legal action in his statement of denial: ‘I conclude by remindingthose who have defamed me or who intend to do so that in making this statement Iam by no means giving up my right to seek redress at law and repeat that Iexpressly reserve my rights to take all such steps as I and my solicitorsconsider necessary to protect my interests.’[../Images/00334.jpg]Figure 371: Lord Alistair McAlpine.What I find strange is that he was talking about legal action at the age of past70 in semi-retirement in Italy when he did not take legal action ‘in his prime’in the 1990s when he was very prominently named as a paedophile in relation toabuse at North Wales children’s homes by the now defunct Scallywag magazine andalso in my book, The Biggest Secret. Incidentally, I did not name him because ofanything to do with Steve Messham who I did not know about except as a namementioned in Scallywag until this story broke in 2012. McAlpine told the BBCthat it had been an ‘horrendous shock’ to hear the allegations, so why wasn’tthe Conservative Party treasurer in the Thatcher era equally ‘horrendouslyshocked’, and why didn’t he therefore sue, when similar allegations involvingNorth Wales children’s homes were published by Scallywag magazine in the 1990sand he was the subject of a banner headline to that effect – and more? TheScallywag article could not have been more explicit and you can read it atDavidicke.com [http://www.Davidicke.com]. Why does he say that it was a‘horrendous shock’ to hear these allegations when similar ones have beenpublished before and he did NOTHING? McAlpine was an extremely rich man and inthe 1990s he was an even more prominent public figure. He could have putScallywag out of business if he had showed in court that its allegations werenot true and this would have nailed the allegations for good and stopped themcirculating on the Internet ever since (without a single challenge fromMcAlpine). Scallywag was instead closed down by covert and calculated means byplayers within McAlpine’s Conservative Party, not least by targeting thedistributors. Derek Laud, another close Thatcher aide who worked alongsideMcAlpine and Chester MP Peter Morrison, was also named as a paedophile and childprocurer by Scallywag at the same time and he also did nothing. Later in the dayafter McAlpine made his denial statement, suddenly Steve Messham retracted hisdecades-old claim that McAlpine was one of his abusers – a statement repeatedonly a few days earlier in part of the Newsnight interview that was notbroadcast. That was shocking enough, but his explanation for doing so wasabsolutely bizarre. Messham apologised for naming McAlpine (he hadn’t publicly)and he said it was a case of ‘mistaken identity’, the same words that McAlpinehad used in his statement earlier the same day. Newsnight then made a grovellingapology for naming McAlpine when they hadn’t – the name was removed from theMessham interview. Newsnight was just about the only BBC news or current affairsprogramme with a trace of backbone, but it was neutered as a result of all thiswith lawyers in attendance to dictate what could and could not be broadcast.Steve Messham said that the reason he recanted that night on his not publiclymentioning the name of Lord McAlpine is that he was shown a picture of him bypolice ‘in the last hour’ and he realised it was not the man who abused him overand over and over decades ago (Fig 372). Messham said that the problem of‘mistaken identity’ arose because police showed him a picture in the 1990s ofthe person that he said abused him and they told him that it was Lord McAlpine.Now they had shown him a picture of the ‘real’ Lord McAlpine ‘in the last hour’and he had realised that it is not the man in the picture that police showed tohim in the 1990s.WHAT? I mean where do you start with an explanation soridiculous? We are asked to believe that in the 15 to 20 years between SteveMessham allegedly being shown the picture of ‘Lord McAlpine’ by police andaccusing him of sexually abusing him in a never-broadcast part of the interviewwith Newsnight that Messham had never once Googled ‘Lord Alistair McAlpine’ andseen the pictures and television footage of him widely available ever since hesaid he was abused?? He never once sought out a picture of McAlpine of any kindin the decades since his time in the children’s home until the police showed himone ‘in the last hour’? He didn’t know what McAlpine looked like even when hehad only recently been in the news with comments about jailed Polly Peckbusinessman, Asil Nadir, and when he was regularly in the news in the 1980sduring the Thatcher era? When I heard what Steve Messham had said I Googled‘Lord Alistair McAlpine’ and up came a stream of pictures widely available waybefore ‘in the last hour’. And yet he never saw a picture of McAlpine in thenearly 20 years between the two photographs shown to him by the police? It makesno sense whatsoever to me. So why did he say it? Your call, but I know what mineis. MP Tom Watson said after he asked his question about the Downing Streetpaedophile ring in Parliament:[../Images/00315.jpg]Figure 372: Steve Messham recants.> I’m not going to let this drop despite warnings from people who should know> that my personal safety is imperilled if I dig any deeper. It’s spooked me so> much that I’ve kept a detailed log of all the allegations should anything> happen.Curiouser and curiouserSteve Messham told Channel Four News only days before he made his sudden‘mistaken identity’ apology how he had broken into the flat of an abuser inNorth Wales and taken dozens of photographs of abusers raping boys, includinghimself, and he said that some clearly showed the face of ‘the prominent Toryabuser’. If this is true then Messham’s ‘mistaken identity’ story lies intatters. Further, he said that he not only had Polaroid photographs of thisfamous abuser, but the man had told him who he was and how he would have himkilled if he ever spoke out. Messham said that he took the photographs to policeand that although the faces of the abusers were clear to see the police saidthat they could not identify men in the pictures. Police now say that they can’tcomment on what happened to the images because of a new inquiry, but Messham’sstory about the pictures is corroborated by Sian Griffiths, who worked in theinquiry office at Clwyd Council in the 1990s during two inquiries into abuse atNorth Wales children’s homes. These were the Jillings report, which was neverpublished because the council was warned by insurers of possible legal action bythose that the victims named, and the main Waterhouse inquiry which did notallow victims to name those who they said were their famous abusers. SianGriffiths, who sat at the administrative centre of both inquiries, told ChannelFour News that Steve Messham’s photographs of abuse were ordered to bedestroyed’. She said: ‘We were supplied with copies of court documents ... therewas an order made for the books and photos to be destroyed.’ Why would you orderthat photographs showing abusers should be destroyed unless it was part of acover-up? Another highly relevant question: The Channel Four News interview withSteve Messham which did not name anyone was no different to the BBC Newsnightinterview with him which equally didn’t name anyone. Yet the BBC (licencefee-payer) has paid £185,000 in compensation to McAlpine over an interview inwhich he wasn’t named?? Did McAlpine seek an out-of-court settlement fromChannel Four News? No, because that would have been laughable and they wouldhave probably told him to stick it somewhere dark and unpleasant. But the BBC iseasy pickings now what’s left of its balls has been handed over on a platter. Apresenter on an ITV programme handed Prime Minister David Cameron a list ofalleged paedophiles, including the name of McAlpine, during a live interview,but the list could not be seen. Never mind, McAlpine was paid another £125,000in ‘libel’ damages for once again not being named. At the same time those,including myself, who did name him and were willing to go all the way to courtwere simply ignored while he took action against Sally Bercow, the wife of theSpeaker of the House of Commons, for a Twitter posting that also didn’t namehim. Two things worthy of note here are a McAlpine book and his ‘art’collection. The book is The New Machiavelli: The Art of Politics in Business,published in 1999, in which he advised readers how to manipulate the media forpersonal benefit. He said: ‘Spread false defeat to gain public sympathy; orfalse accusation and then arrange for it to be exposed as such – so the accuserwill forever be treated with suspicion.’ Curiously, a section of McAlpine’sWikipedia profile was deleted in the ‘Messham’ period which referred to hisone-time ownership of artworks by paedophile Graham Ovenden which featured nakedor half-naked children. Ovenden, now 70, was convicted in 2013 of indecency andindecent assault relating to four children between 1972 and 1985.Me Lord and Me LaudThere are so many strands to this story and so many unanswered questions, butsome things we do know. The Thatcher government and Conservative Party wasinfested with paedophiles and there was a ring involved that went right to‘Number 10’. MP Tom Watson was quite right to ask his question about this. Oneof Thatcher’s significant aides, Derek Laud, who was named as a paedophile inthe Scallywag article in the 1990s, was a speechwriter to Thatcher, manyConservative MPs (including Alan Clark who has been linked with underage sex)and has reportedly written speeches for Prince Charles (Fig 373). Laud is along-time family friend of current Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife andwas a guest at their wedding. Interestingly, when the Savile and McAlpinestories broke Laud’s Wikipedia page was changed to delete two paragraphs. Thefirst was about his friendship with the Camerons and the other his friendshipwith McAlpine and two Conservative ministers:[../Images/00544.jpg]Figure 373: Derek Laud, the close friend of the Camerons who went on holidaywith McAlpine.> Laud is a long standing family friend of Samantha Cameron’s family and a> personal friend of David Cameron and attended their wedding at Ginge, in> Oxfordshire.

The list of> Tory friends with whom he is known to go on holiday and socialise with is> illustrious, and includes Lord McAlpine, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo.Derek Laud, McAlpine and paedophile Chester MP Peter Morrison were close aidesto Margaret Thatcher. This was in the same period that she and her paedophilehusband Denis were close friends of Jimmy Savile, the prolific supplier ofchildren for the rich and famous and, once again, the same question must beasked about the Thatchers as about the royal family. Why was Margaret Thatcherso close to a former disc jockey and all round strange bloke to the extent thathe was invited for cosy chats and spent New Year’s Eve with her year after yearin her time as Prime Minister? What was it about fading ‘entertainer’ Savilethat got him so close to both a sitting Prime Minister and the royal family? Wealso know that an extremely close Thatcher aide, the late Sir Peter Morrison,the Member of Parliament for Chester, has been named as an abuser by residentsof children’s homes in nearby North Wales. Chester is only 13 miles from Wrexhamwhere Steve Messham says that a lot of his abuse took place. Rod Richards, aformer Conservative MP and leader of the Welsh Conservatives, has said publiclythat he has seen evidence connecting Morrison to the North Wales paedophilescandal. Richards said: ‘What I do know is that Morrison was a paedophile ...and the reason I know that is because of the North Wales child abuse scandal.’This is extremely significant when you think that Morrison was ParliamentaryPrivate Secretary to Margaret Thatcher, one of her closest aides, leader of hercampaign team in the Conservative leadership election of 1990 and a deputychairman of the Conservative Party (Fig 374). Thatcher had paedophiles thisclose to her and record-breaking paedophile and child procurer Jimmy Savile as aclose friend, regular visitor to her country home at Chequers and New Yearguest. Did she not know what was going on? Did not current Prime Minister DavidCameron know when he worked for the Conservative Research Department atConservative headquarters between 1988 and 1993, or during his subsequent riseto the leadership? I don’t believe it. This brings us back to MP Tom Watson andhis revelations about a paedophile ring connected to Downing Street. He said ofPeter Righton, who was operating his paedophile network in the same period thatwe are talking about:[../Images/00280.jpg]Figure 374: Peter Morrison, the open secret paedophile who was in Thatcher’sinner circle throughout her time as leader of the Conservative Party and PrimeMinister.> Within the material seized at Righton’s home were letters from known and> convicted paedophiles. The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one> paedophile in particular was of great concern. He said that the paedophile,> who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help> get hold of indecent images of children. I am not naming the person for> obvious reasons but for clarity it is not former MP, Peter Morrison.So here we have yet another paedophile on the inside of the Thatcheradministration at the time of Morrison – and called a ‘key aide’ – who is yet tobe named. How many were there, for goodness sake? And remember that Thatcher hadreplaced the paedophile, Satanist and child-killer Edward Heath as leader of theConservative Party in 1975 and so it all went back much further than her time.Who is McAlpine?Lord McAlpine was the central figure in the Thatcher network of aides andassociates for 15 years between 1975 and 1990 and they spent every Christmastogether at his home in Venice and, on at least one occasion, in Barcelona,Spain. They apparently met in 1975 and he was her party treasurer from thenuntil 1990 and a deputy chairman of the party from 1979 to 1983. The two workedvery closely together throughout the Thatcher years in government and he led thefundraising campaigns for her elections (Fig 375). This apparently involvedchannelling money through offshore accounts and among the donors were seriouslydodgy businessmen like Asil Nadir who was jailed for ten years for a mega fraudin 2012. Nadir gave the party more than £400,000. According to McAlpine’sWikipedia profile: ‘He would later describe his relationship with Thatcher inhis book The Servant ... Using Machiavelli’s The Prince for his analogy, the“Servant” (himself) is an important part of the success of the Prince(Thatcher).’ Okay, we get the picture, he was incredibly close to MargaretThatcher throughout her time as party leader and Prime Minister and yet hedidn’t know about the paedophiles that she had so close to her – a fact that isnow becoming so clear? McAlpine must have known, and to say otherwise is beyondridiculous given his closeness to Thatcher and all that went on. So what did hedo to stop and expose it? Did he not warn her about her close association withJimmy Savile given that so many people knew what he was doing but kept theirmouths shut? Are we to believe that the British Intelligence network includingMI5 didn’t know about Savile and the widespread paedophile activity infestingthe Thatcher administration? Are we to believe that they didn’t tell Thatcher orthat her closest of friends, McAlpine, wasn’t aware through a multitude ofsources what was going on? So, I repeat, what did they do to stop and expose it?Answer: NOTHING. Why? Didn’t other central figures in Thatcher governments know– people like paedophile Deputy Prime Minister Willie Whitelaw and HomeSecretary and Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan (of whom more shortly)?Of course they did and for obvious reasons. Rod Richards, the formerConservative MP and leader of the Welsh Conservatives, confirmed thewidely-known fact that Thatcher’s close aide Peter Morrison was a paedophileconnected to abuse in North Wales children’s homes, and he also said thatWilliam Hague, the then Secretary of State for Wales who set up thefundamentally flawed Waterhouse abuse inquiry, should have known about Morrison.William Hague is now Foreign Secretary in the Cameron government helping todecide which country is bombed next. Former Conservative Minister Edwina Curriesaid that Morrison had sex with underage boys and was protected by a ‘culture ofsniggering’. She called him ‘a noted pederast’. This is defined as ‘a man whohas sex (usually sodomy) with a boy as the passive partner.’ Others havedescribed Morrison’s activities as an ‘open secret’. Currie wrote in herpublished diaries:[../Images/00322.jpg]Figure 375: McAlpine was the force operating largely in the shadows behindThatcher.> One appointment in the recent reshuffle has attracted a lot of gossip and> could be very dangerous: Peter Morrison has become the PM’s PPS [Parliamentary> Private Secretary]. Now he’s what they call a ‘noted pederast’, with a liking> for young boys; he admitted as much to [Conservative Party Chairman] Norman> Tebbit when he became deputy chairman of the party but added ‘However, I’m> very discreet’ – and he must be! She [Thatcher] either knows and is taking a> chance, or doesn’t; either way, it’s a really dumb move [by then Morrison had> been a close aide for 15 years – what does Currie mean Thatcher may not> know?].> [Conservative MP] Teresa Gorman told me this evening (in a taxi coming back> from a drinks party at the BBC) that she inherited Morrison’s (woman) agent,> who claimed to have been offered money to keep quiet about his activities. It> scares me as all the press know, and as we get closer to the election someone> is going to make trouble, very close to her indeed.Currie doesn’t explain why she didn’t go to the police or the media to demandthat something be done about Morrison. It is only a case of how his activitiescould affect her party and the demand therefore that he better be discreet. Itwas Currie, as a health minister with responsibility for high security hospitalsunder Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, who appointed Savile to run a taskforceat Broadmoor in the 1980s which he exploited to abuse patients. Here is Thatcherminister Edwina Currie saying that Norman Tebbit, a key aide and Secretary ofState to Margaret Thatcher and chairman of the Conservative Party, allowed aknown paedophile (widely-known within the party and elsewhere) to be appointed adeputy chairman of the Conservative Party on his watch. Tebbit likes to claimthe moral high ground but we need some serious answers to serious questionsabout why he, Margaret Thatcher and her other key aides and ministers likeWillie Whitelaw, Leon Brittan and Lord McAlpine did not expose this well-knownpaedophile to the police and public instead of giving him jobs in the party andgovernment and allowing him to be right in there among Thatcher’s inner circlefor 15 years. I know why they didn’t, but they must be held to account and askedfor their own alleged reasons. One way that Morrison protected himself fromexposure was to threaten libel actions, just like Jimmy Savile did and othershave done. Peter Connew, one-time editor of the Sunday Mirror, said that whenjournalists ‘doorstepped’ Morrison he would say ‘print and I’ll sue you’. Connewsaid that he had personal experience of the way efforts to name Morrison wereblocked despite him being arrested for attempting to procure young boys inpublic toilets. The police were prevented from charging him and Connew said that‘such was the hush-up that nobody could get hold of the log of the arrest’:> As soon as he was brought in for importuning young boys in public toilets, the> seniors would come down. That was the reason the officers leaked the details:> they were outraged that the seniors had ticked them off for arresting him.This is how paedophile and satanic rings worldwide are protected from publicexposure. They cover the leading positions in law enforcement and Intelligencewith either paedophiles and Satanists or those willing to cover up for them.Genuine people in these organisations can then be blocked by those whoultimately make the decisions, as with the Morrison case just described. WestYorkshire police, the ‘law-enforcer’ for Savile’s home city of Leeds, publisheda ‘report’ in May, 2013 clearing themselves of all allegations that Savile’smany friends in the police protected him from exposure and prosecution. Ascover-up and mendacity goes it takes some beating. Of course he was protectedand not just by West Yorkshire police officers, either – by the highest levelsof the British Establishment to which he was supplying children. MI5 certainlyknew all about the paedophile activities of the late MP for Rochdale inLancashire, Sir Cyril Smith, who was not even in government or the mainopposition party (Fig 376). Smith was another friend of Savile’s, as was thepaedophile Jeremy Thorpe, the leader of the Liberal Party at the time that Heathled the Conservatives and Wilson the Labour Party. Tony Robinson, a specialbranch officer with Lancashire Police in the 1970s, has described seeing apolice dossier ‘thick’ with allegations from boys saying that Cyril Smith hadabused them. The dossier of Smith’s abuse was kept in a safe at special branchheadquarters in Hutton, Preston, and Robinson said these words were written atthe top: ‘No further action, not in the public interest. DPP [Director of PublicProsecutions].’ No, it wasn’t in the Establishment paedophile ring’s intereststo prosecute and as always the interests of the abused children were irrelevant.Robinson said that shortly after seeing the file he was called by an MI5 officerwho said that the evidence should be sent to London. Police now say apparentlythat the file has been ‘lost’ – sound familiar? Greater Manchester Policecompounded and confirmed the cover-up when they dropped a new investigation in2013 after the truth about Smith had been made public. So MI5 would cover up fora lowly politician nowhere near government, but would not cover for a majorpaedophile ring operating out of 10 Downing Street? And Thatcher and leadingfigures who were so close to her did not know it was going on? Thatcher,McAlpine and others like Tebbit, Whitelaw and Brittan must have known aboutthese paedophile activities but took no action to expose what was happening.Thatcher and Whitelaw are dead, but the others need to be questioned. The caseof close Thatcher aide Peter Morrison alone reveals a scandalous disregard forthe boys that he was abusing in North Wales and elsewhere, and what didThatcher’s ministers and aides know about close friend of the Thatchers, JimmySavile? Party Chairman Norman Tebbit, now Lord Tebbit, who was invited toSavile’s funeral, is quoted as saying: ‘Jimmy was more than just a nice chap –he was a remarkably sharp and thoughtful man.’ My goodness, Tebbit was a goodjudge of character, then. The North Wales story goes further. Scallywag saidthat MI5 took foreign diplomats to the North Wales homes and secretly filmedthem abusing and torturing boys to use the tapes for blackmail. This is a commonIntelligence modus operandi with regard to child abuse by the famous andinfluential, especially politicians that they want to control.[../Images/00550.jpg]Figure 376: Cyril Smith – his well-known child abuse was covered up by BritishIntelligence (inversion).The Dickens DossierA new front emerged in the exposure of the El-lite’s sickening activities withthe notorious Elm Guest House in Rocks Lane, Barnes, south-west London, a havenfor homosexual men and paedophiles, including Cyril Smith. No, the two terms areabsolutely not interchangeable. A high percentage of paedophiles are women andbeing a homosexual of any variety certainly does not make you a paedophile assome would have people believe. It just so happens that Elm House catered forboth. Names of regular visitors emerging from Internet sources once connected toElm House include a number of members of the Monday Club, a far-right factionwithin the Conservative Party which supported the apartheid regime in SouthAfrica. Thatcher aide Derek Laud, named by Scallywag magazine as a paedophileand child procurer, was the first black member of the Monday Club as he was thefirst black master of foxhounds in the country in the satanic centre known asthe New Forest in Hampshire where the Rothschilds have a mansion. Both theMonday Club and foxhunting are environments normally far from welcoming andconducive to black people. Laud was given the nickname ‘Golly’. Another name onthe Elm list posted on the Internet was leading Thatcher Cabinet Minister LeonBrittan (Rothschild Zionist), the political sponsor of Deputy Prime MinisterNick Clegg and appointed by Prime Minister Cameron as a ‘trade advisor’ (Fig377). Brittan was Thatcher’s Home Secretary when Conservative MP, GeoffreyDickens, said that he handed Brittan a dossier exposing El-lite paedophilia.Brittan did not act on the contents and says that he has no recollection of it.Well, funny that because others do and the authorities certainly seemed verykeen to make it disappear – which it has. This included the targeting of BritishIntelligence operative Andrea Davison whom I met and swapped notes with in the1990s at her home in North Wales when she was investigating the paedophilescandal and its connections to the highest levels of government. The lateGeoffrey Dickens shared a number of pages of his dossier with Davison, but shewas targeted by police in North Wales and Derbyshire and her home raided toremove files on child abuse including what she had been given by Dickens. Shesaid:[../Images/00226.jpg]Figure 377: Leon Brittan – what dark eyes you have.> Many of my documents and evidence was stolen by the Police. I am reliably> informed that they were worried in 2009 that because of Jimmy Savile the VIP> Paedophile Ring would be exposed and they made an effort to as the Derby> police put it ‘tie up loose ends’.She was then convicted of a ‘crime’ in which no one was harmed and no one lostany money. In a rather strange coincidence, Nicolas Parry, the judge who imposeda jail sentence totalling three years on Davison, was a lawyer who defendedalleged paedophiles at the ‘inquiry’ into child abuse at North Wales ‘care’homes while Davison was representing victims. Did Parry make this clear when hewas pronouncing sentence? If not, why not? Davison managed to flee the countrybefore the sentence was made and has continued her efforts to expose El-litepaedophiles from her present location. I am still in regular touch with her. Oneof the absolute musts when the boil is burst and the rings exposed is for AndreaDavison to be given a pardon and a thank you for doing the right thing while thestate covered up the evil in its midst. Geoffrey Dickens ran a campaign in the1980s to expose the paedophile rings and what he called ‘big, big names – peoplein positions of power, influence and responsibility’. He used Parliamentaryprivilege to name Sir Peter Hayman, a diplomat and MI6 operative, as apaedophile and you can see why British Intelligence covers up the paedophilerings when it centrally involved itself.Across the partiesPaedophiles and cover-ups are not confined to the Conservative Party in the UK,as we have seen with Cyril Smith and the disgusting cover-up of a paedophilering by the Labour Party-controlled Islington Council in London headed at thetime by Tony Blair’s neighbour, Margaret Hodge, formerly Margaret Oppenheimer(Rothschild Zionist). The ring was exposed by the Evening Standard in 1992 whenHodge accused the newspaper of ‘a sensationalist piece of gutter journalism’even though she had long known about paedophiles preying on children thatIslington council should have been protecting. Senior social workers reportingabuse to her were dismissed as ‘obsessional’. Having disgracefully let downchildren in her council’s care she went into national politics where PrimeMinister Tony Blair made her his ... no, this is not a joke ... Minister forChildren. One Islington social worker described the appointment as ‘like puttingthe fox in charge of the chickens’. Hodge is now head of the House of CommonsPublic Accounts Committee and a member of the Queen’s Privy (‘Private’ or‘Secret’) Council of advisors. Hodge’s friend, Harriet Harman, the deputy leaderof the Labour Party, campaigned as a senior figure in a civil libertiesorganisation for the age of sexual consent to be lowered to 14 and incestdecriminalised and called on ministers to make sexually explicit photographs orfilms of children legal unless there was evidence that the subject had beenharmed. Her organisation defended self-confessed paedophiles and allowed them toattend its meetings. War criminal and long-time Prime Minister Tony Blairrepresented the paedophile-infested Labour Party and at his private school,Fettes in Edinburgh, Scotland, he was a close friend of its chaplain, the VeryReverend Dr Ronald Selby Wright, who was known as a persistent paedophile.Edinburgh is a major centre for El-ite paedophilia and secret societies. Wrightwas a Church of Scotland Moderator and Chaplain to the Queen, and Fetteshistorian Robert Philip once said that the young Blair looked up to Dr Wright asa ‘spiritual mentor’. Philip said: ‘When Mr Blair was having trouble with theestablishment, he confided in Ronald. I think a lot of seeds for his religiousfaith were sown there.’ Yes, I bet there were. The Establishment club is sosmall that Blair’s housemaster at Fettes, Sir William ‘Eric’ Kinloch Anderson,also taught Prince Charles at Gordonstoun in Scotland and was Head Master ofEton during David Cameron’s time there. Two prime ministers and an heir to thethrone – quite a CV. It is indeed a small world at this level with Blair’s wife,Cherie, descended from the Booth family of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin ofPresident Lincoln in 1865. Tony Blair is reported to have blocked the exposureof famous names in law, business and politics, including some in his owncabinet, during the police investigation into paedophile Internet activity knownas Operation Ore, which came out of the FBI investigation in the United Statescalled Operation Avalanche. Neither convicted any of the big fish as usual. Thefigures in Operation Ore were enormous: 7,250 suspects identified, 4,283 homessearched, 3,744 arrests, 1,848 charged, 1,451 convictions, 493 cautioned and 140children removed from suspected dangerous situations. But still no major namesin the paedophile-infested El-ite levels of society. Operation Avalanche in theUS produced 35,000 Internet records, but only 100 charges. Blair’s guru andfixer Lord Peter Mandelson, who flaunts his associations with the Rothschilds,declined to explain why his name appeared in the ‘little black book’ ofconvicted paedophile and disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein, a closefriend of Britain’s Prince Andrew. Epstein’s contacts book had 16 numbers forPrince Andrew who stayed at his homes and included an office address for TonyBlair. Virginia Roberts, a teenage masseuse allegedly recruited as a ‘sex slave’for Epstein, said she remembered seeing Lord Mandelson at the financier’stownhouse in New York. Mandelson worked with Prince Andrew on a campaign for theNational Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), a charitysupported by Jimmy Savile and Margaret Thatcher. I personally have no trust init whatsoever. Blair was leader of the Labour Party at the time of the masskilling of children by known paedophile Thomas Hamilton who walked into DunblanePrimary School in Scotland in 1996 and shot dead 16 children and a teacherbefore killing himself. Hamilton, like Savile, was a procurer of children for‘pillars’ of the Establishment. Scottish judge Lord Cullen was appointed to headthe official inquiry into Dunblane and he ordered that significant documentsrelating to the case should be locked away from public view for a hundred years.He said that this was to protect the victims and families when anyone with abrain could see that it was to protect the Establishment. Cullen also led thefive-judge tribunal which heard the appeal against conviction of the (innocent)Lockerbie ‘plane bomber’ Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi and decided that he wasguilty. It was revealed that Lord Cullen is a member of an elite Freemasonicgroup based at Edinburgh University known as the Speculative Society. CIAwhistle-blower Susan Lindauer, who I mentioned earlier in relation to 9/11, saidthat Lockerbie was nothing to do with Libya and related to the CIA herointrafficking operation routed through Frankfurt, London and the United States.Lord Burton, a former Grand Master of Scottish Freemasonry, told a BritishSunday newspaper that Cullen’s Dunblane ‘inquiry’ was a coverup that suppressedcrucial information and he linked Cullen to what he called the ‘Super Mason’Speculative Society (Fig 378). He said that he had been bullied and threatenedby other members of the House of Lords when he tried to raise his concerns abouta Dunblane cover-up. ‘There’s no escaping the fact that there’s somethingsinister about the whole affair’, he said. Thomas Hamilton wandered around QueenVictoria School, Dunblane’s only private boarding school – just like Savile didin girls’ homes and hospitals – and these people are given so much protectionand free reign because they are the sources of children for the paedophiles thatrun government and law enforcement.[../Images/00210.jpg]Figure 378: The Dunblane cover up to protect El-ite paedophiles.Blunt and the RoyalsI have been on the trail of El-ite paedophilia and Satanism on both sides of theAtlantic for two decades but I still shake my head at the same recurring namesyear after year in location after location. Another Elm Guest House ‘name’familiar to me is Anthony Blunt who is alleged to have used the name ‘AnthonyGoldstein’ when visiting the establishment where children were abused. Blunt wasone of the infamous ‘Cambridge Five’ British Intelligence insiders who spied forthe Soviet Union. Four of them were Blunt, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and KimPhilby and the mysterious ‘Fifth Man’, never named, was Lord Victor Rothschild,although there were actually more than five. Blunt leads us once again to theBritish royal family (Fig 379). Anthony Blunt (1907-1983) was born the thirdcousin of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon who became the wife of King George VI and is bestknown as the late Queen Mother, the satanic witch that Princess Diana describedas evil. His own mother was the second cousin of the black witch’s father ClaudeBowes-Lyon, the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Blunt and his brotherswould go for afternoon tea with the Bowes-Lyons at their London home in Mayfairand he was in the royal, political and Intelligence loop almost from the start.There is another highly significant aspect of the Blunt story according to theLondon Daily Mail. The paper reported that he told colleagues he was actuallythe secret son of King George V, the brother of Bowes-Lyon’s spouse, George VI.This would put what was to happen later in a much clearer context. Blunt waseducated at the El-ite Marlborough College where he was a member of theHonourable Fraternity of the Amici. This is a rarely-mentioned secret societybased at Marlborough but also operating at other El-ite colleges including Eton,Radley and Wellington. Its rituals appear to be based on Freemasonry with asystem of degrees and prominence for the symbol of the all-seeing eye. Amiciinitiates use their covert manipulation to secure major positions of influenceamong the students and this continues when they enter the worlds of business andpolitics. It is the usual worldwide story, in other words, as with the Skull andBones Society at Yale, the Quill and Dagger at Cornell and the Sphinx Society atDartmouth College in New Hampshire. Blunt also spent part of his childhood inParis when his official father, the Reverend Stanley Vaughan Blunt, ran thechapel at the British embassy. Blunt had many royal and Establishmentconnections throughout his formative years and things began to move quickly whenhe won a scholarship to Trinity College at Cambridge University. It was atCambridge that he became a member of a Russian spy ring which was passingBritish secrets to Moscow during World War II. Four members have since beenofficially named as Blunt, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Kim Philby, whomarried Jewish Soviet spy Litzi Friedman (Fig 380). But others got away with itincluding their leader, Lord Victor Rothschild, whose eldest son, JacobRothschild (4th Baron Rothschild), is one of the family’s leading members today.Highly significant to the ring was a university secret society called theCambridge Apostles. Blunt was a member and so was Guy Burgess and other spiesand alleged spies, John Cairncross, Guy Liddell and the most important of all,Victor Rothschild (Fig 381). Blunt acted as a talent spotter and recruiter forthe ring and his value as a potential Soviet source increased when he wasrecruited by MI5. Maclean and Burgess fled to the Soviet Union in 1951to avoidprosecution and Philby followed in 1963 after more than a decade of denial whichsaw him continuing to work for newspapers and part-time for MI6. Blunt secretlyadmitted his involvement to MI5 in 1963 on condition that he had immunity frompersecution and this was not made public until 1979 when Prime Minister MargaretThatcher was forced by the weight of evidence by then in the public domain tomake a statement to this effect. The ring master behind all of this was LordVictor Rothschild who at one time shared his London flat with the homosexualBurgess and Blunt. Homosexuality was a criminal offence at the time and aperfect vehicle for blackmail even without the paedophilia that also went on.[../Images/00551.jpg]Figure 379: Jimmy Savile’s friend with the paedophile,child-killer and spy,Anthony Blunt.[../Images/00572.jpg]Figure 380: Blunt, Maclean, Burgess and Philby. What, no Rothschild?[../Images/00040.jpg]Figure 381: Lord Victor Rothschild – the Hidden Hand.Official biographies say that Rothschild was recruited by MI5 during the war inthe same way as Blunt, but in fact Rothschild ran British Intelligence andwartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, another reported paedophile. ‘Nationalhero’ Winston Churchill was a despicable character who worked covertly for theglobal enemies of freedom and peace, the Rothschilds. They were a secret sourceof income. There is a very good chance that Churchill was a Rothschildbloodline, and the Windsors have been since their origins in Germany from wherethe Rothschild global empire of finance and secret society manipulation emerged.Victor Rothschild was known within British Intelligence as the ‘Black Bag Man’because he controlled the secret ‘stash’ that covertly funded off-the-recordprojects that the official government had refused to sanction. He knew where thebodies were buried throughout the Establishment and who was doing what to whomamong royalty, politicians, media and academia. This allowed him to manipulateand dictate through threat of exposure. These are the techniques that continueto be used today by the Rothschild networks and this is another reason why theylove to see paedophiles in positions of power to impose the legislation tochange society in the desired Orwellian fashion. The same happens in NorthAmerica and in fact everywhere the Rothschilds and their lackeys are at workwhich is, well, pretty much everywhere. Victor Rothschild was WinstonChurchill’s minder and the director of his policy before and during World WarII, a war in which the Rothschild Archontic networks controlled all the majorplayers through their placemen Roosevelt (United States), Churchill (Britain),Stalin (Soviet Union) and Hitler (Germany). This is the point that historiansand researchers of the Cambridge spy ring don’t understand. Victor Rothschildwas not a Soviet spy. He was the Rothschilds’ man directing British war policyas others were directing that of North America, the Soviet Union and Germany.The spying was largely done for the Rothschilds, not the Soviet Union, but thereis also the fact that if you want to stop something happening that doesn’t suityour agenda, or take most advantage of something happening when it does, thentell another ‘side’ (another of your sides) what is going to happen well beforeit does. This is what the Cambridge spy ring was really all about, but onlyRothschild among them would have known that. The rest were convenient stoogesand who was the one that never got caught? Rothschild. Six retired KGB colonelsconfirmed after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1993 that Rothschild wasinvolved in the Cambridge spy ring, but they wouldn’t have known the widerbackground either. Compartmentalisation is the key.The Nazi WindsorsAnthony Blunt was so trusted by the royal family and his cousin ElizabethBowes-Lyon (after all, he claimed to be one of them) that he was sent on amission to Germany at the end of the war to retrieve British royalcorrespondence to their German royal relatives showing support for the Nazis –which is what the royals are. Prince Philip’s Nazi background is welldocumented, for example, but he’s not alone (Fig 382). The House of Windsor wereofficially the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Herzogtum Sachsen-Coburg undGotha) until they changed their name to Windsor during the First World War as anexercise purely in public relations with Britain at war with Kaiser Wilhelm andtheir other relatives in Germany. Wilhelm was the cousin of King George V, whomBlunt apparently said was his father, and George was also a cousin of TsarNicholas II of Russia. The British wing of the Battenberg family anglicisedtheir name to Mountbatten at the same time and later it was Lord LouisMountbatten who maintained communications between the Windsors and theirrelatives in Nazi Germany even though he was Britain’s Chief of CombinedOperations and Supreme Allied Commander in South-East Asia. ‘Sides’ don’t matterto these people – the outcome is what counts. Anthony Blunt’s reward forservices rendered in hiding the Nazi truth about the Windsor-Mountbattens was tobe appointed Surveyor of the King’s Pictures when he retired from MI5 after thewar even though he was still a member of the Rothschild spy ring and was seenwith Burgess and Maclean just before they defected in 1951. Blunt continued inhis royal role when George VI died in 1953 and his daughter Elizabeth becameQueen. The Royals well knew about Blunt’s treasonous background. Army officerPhilip Hay went for an interview at Buckingham Palace in 1948 for the post ofPrivate Secretary to the Dowager Duchess of Kent and he said that after theypassed Blunt in a corridor, Sir Alan Lascelles, King George VI’s privatesecretary, said: ‘That’s our Russian spy’. The Queen had been briefed aboutBlunt’s secret confession (not that she needed to be) but he continued to workin all the royal palaces as the official advisor on her art collection. VictorRothschild turned up to at least one dinner party with his friend Blunt yearsafter his admission of spying. Meanwhile, other British spies such as JohnVassall, a clerk at the British embassy in Moscow whose homosexuality was usedto blackmail him, was jailed for 18 years when he was not in the same league oftreachery as Blunt and company.[../Images/00126.jpg]Figure 382: Prince Philip at a Nazi funeral.Blunt, the royals and paedophiliaThe Windsors would have also known that Blunt was a paedophile and it is nosurprise to me whatsoever after hearing him named many times that he has turnedup on the alleged lists of visitors to the Elm Guest House. The stories havelong circulated about his procurement of young boys, mostly from ‘care’ homes,and his paedophile parties. These include how Blunt would murder childrenthrough asphyxiation while they were being raped because of the apparent sexual‘high’ these sickest of people get from this. One rapist would be a masked mansaid to be a royal or a Rothschild (same thing) who always wore socks even whenotherwise naked. He became known as the ‘Soxon Rothschild’. Blunt also ran apaedophile ring and was a friend of Stephen Ward who was at the centre of theProfumo Affair in early 1960s when the British Secretary of State for War, JohnProfumo, was exposed for having an affair with the model and dancer ChristineKeeler, who was also having a relationship with Eugene Ivanov, a Russianmilitary attaché. Key events in the story happened at Cliveden, theBuckinghamshire mansion owned by the Astor family, and the usual suspects wereinvolved, although of course not named, including Lord Mountbatten and PrincePhilip. Stephen Ward was the fall-guy in the story and he ‘committed suicide’ tokeep himself quiet. You know how it goes. Blunt and his boyfriend, the formerIrish Guards bandsman John Gaskin, lived in a flat at the Courtauld Institute ofArt off London’s Oxford Street where Blunt was director, and Gaskin would go outtrawling public toilets for young men drunk or drugged enough to bring back forBlunt’s pleasure. When Gaskin began to blab about Blunt’s activities, he ‘fell’out of a window and landed on railings some distance below. Miraculously hesurvived, but later he is said to have thrown himself in front of a train fiveyears after Blunt had died in 1983. The royal family knew all about Blunt’spaedophilia and child murder just as they knew about their close friend fordecades, Jimmy Savile. Blunt once went for tea with his cousin the Queen Motherand took with him a 12 year old boy, according to a footman who said that heoverheard her tell Blunt: ‘You will keep my secrets and I will keep yours.’ Andmy god, they both had some. I understand why so many people find it impossibleto comprehend that members of the royal family, political leaders and fetedacademics, entertainers and big banking and corporate names would be involved inpaedophilia, murder and human sacrifice, but they are. When you connect the dotsthe picture is devastating for the royal family and the Conservative Partyadministrations of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher between 1979 and 1990. JimmySavile was a close friend of Lord Mountbatten, Prince Philip and Prince Charlesfrom the 1960s and this continued for decades after the cover-up of Heath’spaedophilia and child murder in association with Savile. You mean they didn’tknow? Is someone having a laugh? British Intelligence didn’t know? Ditto.British Intelligence didn’t know that a record-breaking paedophile had beeninterviewed by police but not charged on a number of occasions for sexual abuseagainst minors and didn’t know about his legendary sexual abuses over 54 years?Of course they knew, but some at MI5 and MI6 would have been among his clients.A British newspaper quoted a ‘Buckingham Palace insider’ as saying that PrinceCharles ‘was furious that he was never informed about suspicions that Savile wasa pervert who preyed on children.’ The ‘insider’ said ‘the Palace have been onto the security services to see why they were not informed’ and the sourcecontinued:> The Queen, Philip, Charles and others want to know why no-one picked up a> phone to tell them a child abuser was being allowed in royal homes and meeting> with senior royals and their families ...What a load of baloney. I’ll tell you why they didn’t pick up the phone – theywere already well aware that the royals knew and had done so since paedophileMountbatten brought Savile into the fold as a child procurer in the 1960s. Thisis the same royal family that employed at close range another infamouspaedophile and child murderer, Anthony Blunt, and like so many paedophiles andkillers, including Savile, gave him a knighthood. British Intelligence didn’tknow what Blunt was doing? He worked for them as well as moonlighting for theRothschilds and the KGB. British Intelligence, while employing I am sure manygenuine people, has been infested by Satanists and paedophiles including theformer head of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, Sir Maurice Oldfield. Hewas a friend and associate of Victor Rothschild and one of his haunts was theKincora Boys’ Home in Belfast, Northern Ireland, along with Establishmentpaedophiles like Mountbatten and Heath. Oldfield was another paedophile given aknighthood by the royals and he was also made a member of the Most DistinguishedOrder of Saint Michael and Saint George, another royal ‘chivalry’ order in theirweb of elite groupings and secret societies.Paedophile politicsThe wider implications of paedophile politicians and royalty mean thatpaedophiles in power can be blackmailed to change society through legislation inways that the blackmailers demand ... or else. The Rothschilds operating out ofBritain, Germany, France and Rome have been the force behind the creation ofwhat is now the European Union on their way to a global fascist dictatorshipbased on a world government, army, bank and currency. Edward Heath wascompletely controlled by the Rothschilds because of his paedophilia and childmurder. Rothschild asset Heath was the most constant and vocal advocate overdecades of Britain’s entry into the then European Economic Community (EEC) andit was Heath as Prime Minister who signed Britain’s entry on January 1st 1973.Heath’s policies during his premiership between 1970 and 74 were largelydictated by a Think Tank called the Central Policy Review Staff which was headedby ... Lord Victor Rothschild. One of the policies was the industrialisation andchemicalisation of farming methods which Rothschild had championed as chairmanof the Agricultural Research Council from 1948 to 1958. Rothschild was afrequent guest of Heath’s at the Prime Minister’s country residence at Chequers,west of London, from where Heath and his Chancellor Anthony Barber would attendsatanic rituals at Burnham Beeches as I explained earlier. Victor Rothschild wasalso close to Heath’s political opponent, the Labour Party Prime Minister,Harold Wilson. Either Wilson or Heath was in Downing Street from 1964 to 1975and both were attached to strings held by Rothschild. Dr Kitty Little, with abackground at Oxford University, was a long-time researcher into the corruptionand infiltration within the British Intelligence agencies and had access tosources at some very high levels for more than 50 years. Her career as ascientist included research for the Ministry of Aircraft Production during theSecond World War followed by nine years at the Atomic Energy ResearchEstablishment at Harwell. She shared insider knowledge with me in the 1990s andsome of it was in her submission in 1995 to the Nolan Committee on Standards inPublic Life. She described an attempt to recruit her to the Communist Party atOxford University in 1940 and what she said is even more significant given whathas happened since. Kitty Little said that the ‘communists’ had gone undergroundby joining the university Labour Party and she attended a meeting of a LabourParty ‘study group’ in a room at University College. The main speaker at themeeting, who clearly believed he was among friends, began to reveal the plot bya subversive organisation to ‘destabilise the United Kingdom and Commonwealth,ready for a Marxist takeover’. She later realised that this was part of the planto introduce the global centralised Control System that I have spent all theseyears exposing. The plot was outlined by the speaker at that Oxford meeting todestroy United Kingdom defences, engineer a Marxist takeover of Rhodesia andSouth Africa, and to use what is now the European Union as a smokescreen to hidethe changeover to a centralised, Marxist, rule of Europe. The plan was also todestroy the British manufacturing industry. He went on to describe how membersof the political section of this subversive organisation were going toinfiltrate the British parliament and civil service, some entering each of thepolitical parties. Many would go into the right wing of the Labour Party, othersto the left wing of the Conservatives. Eventually there would be a fusion into anew ‘centre’ party. He said that the British distrusted extremists and so posingas ‘moderates’ occupying the centre ground would allow them to dismiss theiropponents as ‘right wing extremists’. This is precisely what has happened. Wehad the creation in 1981of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) by the ‘Gang ofFour’ who jumped ship from the Labour Party. They were Lord (Roy) Jenkins, Lord(David) Owen, Bill Rogers and Shirley Williams. All supported the EuropeanCommunity/Union and Jenkins went on to be President of the European Commission.Eventually their party fused with the Liberals to become today’s official‘centre party’, the Liberal Democrats. Tony Blair and his heavies then turnedthe Labour Party into the ‘centre-ground’ (extremist) ‘New’ Labour and anotherpolitical fake called David Cameron, or Blair Mark II, has done the same withthe Conservative Party. All three now pretty much stand on the same postagestamp. The subversive organisation did not have a name, the speaker at Oxfordsaid, because that would make it harder for people to prove it existed. He saidthat he had been chosen to head the political section of this organisation andthat he, himself, expected to one day become the prime minister of the UnitedKingdom. All this was said in 1940 and that man did indeed become primeminister. His name was Harold Wilson. He was British Prime Minister throughoutthe period between 1964 and 1976, except for the four years between 1970 and 74when the Conservative Party leader Edward Heath was in office (Fig 383). HaroldWilson and Ted Heath were both close associates of Lord Victor Rothschild, whoheaded what Wilson called the ‘biological section’ of the subversiveorganisation and controlled British Intelligence. It was during a Wilsonpremiership that Rothschild arranged for the covert export of plutonium toIsrael to establish their now massive nuclear weapons programme (see ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free). Victor Rothschild was the force behind the expansionof nuclear power (for reasons that I will come to later) and worked in supportof this by manipulating the miners’ strikes of the Heath years which at one timeled to Britain moving to a three-day working week to conserve energy. Severalanti-nuclear protestors met unexplained or suspicious deaths in this sameperiod. Rothschild became senior security advisor to Margaret Thatcher at thesame time that his Rothschild Zionist associate Sir Colin Figures was head ofMI6. Rothschild was also the instigator behind the sacking of BBC DirectorGeneral Alasdair Milne in 1987 after Thatcher had appointed his friend MarmadukeHussey as head of the BBC governors. I was at the BBC at the time and met Milne.He was the last genuine defender of the BBC’s independence and it’s been alldownhill ever since exactly as planned. These are the wheels within wheelsturning all the time under the cover of official versions of events which arerepeated without question by the mainstream media, and paedophilia and itsmanipulation is right at the centre of this.[../Images/00309.jpg]Figure 383: Harold Wilson with his fellow conspirator, oops, sorry, politicalopponent, Edward Heath.The cover-up industryA report published by ‘Her Majesty’s’ Inspectorate of Constabulary into theSavile affair concluded that many opportunities to arrest him and stop the abusewere missed because police failed to ‘connect the dots’. But hold on. There is‘failing’ to connect the dots, and there is knowing that if you do, the picturewill be seen and exposed and that is not the idea. This is what really happenedand police were exposed for burying sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savilein files marked ‘restricted’ and ‘sensitive’ as they did with MP Cyril Smith andso many others. British Intelligence knew all about him but did nothing and itwas the same with the Thatcher government and the royal family. He had his backcovered because of the children that he was providing and the knowledge that ifhis actions became known then potentially all of theirs would too. Paedophilesand Satanists are placed throughout law enforcement in major positions and thejudiciary, Intelligence agencies and government to keep the lid on when itthreatens to come off. We had the usual ‘this must never happen again’ when itwas already happening with the police ‘investigations’ launched into Savile(Operation Yewtree), the Elm Guest House (Operation Fernbridge), MP Tom Watson’sallegations (Operation Fairbank), and a new ‘inquiry’ into the North Wales abuse(Operation Pallial). First of all there needs to be a coordination organisationto gather information from all of them and connect the common names and evidenceand, secondly, the lessons of history are not good when it comes to genuinelyseeking to expose the truth. By the time you read this perhaps the police willhave located their testicles and done the right thing at last, but either way Ishall continue to do everything I can to make the hidden public. There are somegenuine police officers involved who want to pursue the truth but the systemwill be closing ranks in every way it can. The Operation Yewtree report intoSavile completely ignored his child procurement, let alone his publicly knownclose connections to the royal family and the Thatcher government. The policehave to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Queen and so are they going to dowhat is necessary in that direction? Yewtree has arrested a few ‘B’ and ‘C’ listcelebrities at the time of writing but all the big royal and political playershave been left alone.Metropolitan Police Commander Peter Spindler said that Savile’s crimes were‘vast, predatory and opportunistic’ and he had effectively ‘groomed the nation’.Sounds good but, personally, I would not trust the Met’s investigation OperationYewtree to pursue the real truth about Savile any more than I would have trustedhim to produce the school nativity. Spindler ludicrously added that Savile usedhis celebrity to ‘hide in plain sight’. Oh, no, no, no, mate. That will not do.Savile got away with it for 54 years because he was protected by the highestlevels of the paedophile-Satanist-controlled British Establishment for whom hewas procuring children. The evidence of a highlyorganised and extraordinarilyextensive paedophile ring connecting royal palaces, Downing Street and theWestminster Parliament is overwhelming and mounting by the week. Theimplications of the full truth being revealed can hardly be overstated. It woulddevastatingly discredit the major political parties, bring an end of themonarchy and trigger a total public re-evaluation of everything they havebelieved about the country they live in and the forces that dictate its laws,direction and methods of operation. The knock-on effect would be the same formuch of the rest of the world, because what I am describing is happening inevery country to a larger or lesser extent and not least in the United States.The most obvious paedophile racket of all is the Roman Catholic (Babylonian)Church which worships the Demiurge as ‘God’ and provides a global source ofchild energy through its army of paedophiles in fancy dress. It is a sign thattimes are changing that, in 2013, Nazi Youth member Joseph Ratzinger, or PopeBenedict XVI, became the first Pope to resign in 600 years in a move withoutquestion connected to paedophilia and paedophilia cover-ups along with, nodoubt, endless other corruption, financial and otherwise, under his watch at theVatican before and after he became Pope (Fig 384). He announced his resignationdays before a documentary ran on American television exposing Ratzinger’scentral role in covering up paedophilia in the Church worldwide. Ratzinger wasappointed in 1981 by the wrongly rose-painted Pope John Paul II to head theCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), formerly the Supreme SacredCongregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition – the mass murdering andtorturing ‘Holy Inquisition’. The same Pope John Paul, who awarded a PapalKnighthood to Jimmy Savile, decreed in 2001 that all child abuse cases worldwideinvolving the Catholic clergy should be dealt with directly by Ratzinger at theCDF with the role, carried out with vigour, of stopping the Church-destroyingtruth coming to public attention and, in doing so, denying justice to abusedchildren and allowing paedophile priests and bishops to stay in their jobs andcontinue their abuse of other children. Ratzinger resigned because of illhealth, as claimed? His mate John Paul II continued in his last four yearsdespite suffering from Parkinson’s disease, severe arthritis and havingdifficulty speaking and hearing. Popes don’t resign and this is why it hasn’thappened for 600 years. This is really about the truth coming out and there is atidal wave of that still to do so – especially in Ratzinger’s case. I have saidit for two decades and I will go on saying it – paedophilia and Satanism are thecement that hold the global Establishment together and the Roman Church isfounded upon both going back to its theological ‘inspiration’ in Babylon andbeyond.[../Images/00508.jpg]Figure 384: The Church of Rome is a global bastion of child abuse and JosephRatzinger was in charge of the cover up for decades.And that leads us into the next strand in the Archontic web and one of the mostimportant of all – religion."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00293.jpg]Archon ReligionI looked in temples, churches and mosques, but I found the Divine in my heartRumiReligion has been the greatest form of mass mind and emotional control. Notreligions – but religion, singular. The plural only appears to be the casebecause the worship of the same deities has been hidden behind different namessuch as Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Hinduism. There is really only one‘ism’, be it Judaism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, monotheism, polytheism,fascism, socialism, Conservatism, commercialism or, the collective noun for allthem – Bollockism.The foundation ‘ism’ on which all others are stand is Controlism and allreligions are the religion of Controlism and Bollockism. We are All Possibility,All That Is, Has Been and Ever Can Be and the worst nightmare of theDemiurge-Archons is that we should remember and express this through ourperceptions and behaviour. So they used their bloodlines to inflict upon thehuman mind the blueprint of human control that we call religion. This has anumber of simultaneous goals and among them are: (1) Vampire the energy of thecongregations and followers as they focus their attention on Archontic-Saturnicsymbols; (2) Manipulate people to worship the Demiurge-Archons as god or gods;(3) Slam shut the minds of the worshipping masses through rejection of all otherpossibility beyond the belief system that the religion is peddling; (4) Play offreligion against religion and faction against faction on the basis of ‘my god isthe only god’ when they are in fact all worshipping the same ‘god’, or gods.Brilliant. But then the Archons are masters of deception. Christians and otherreligions preach that ‘Satan’ is a master of deception, but they have beendeceived themselves by the very force they warn about. Everything is inverted intrue Archon fashion and you have the same force playing the good guy ‘God’ andthe bad guy ‘anti-god’ under names like Satan, the Devil and Lucifer. No matterif people worship the symbol of the ‘good guy’, like Jesus, or the ‘bad guy’, asin Satanism, they are worshipping the same guy in different guises and havingtheir energy trawled and their minds programmed either which way. The GreatDeceiver of Christianity has greatly deceived Christians. The mind-scramble goeslike this: ‘Satan has deceived people into believing in all other religions –except mine because mine is the only true religion.’ I came across the followingquote in an otherwise very good article about religion and Saturn: ‘As long asyou are praying to someone or something other than the true god AHAYAH, Satanhas succeeded.’ I mean, doubleface-palm. How about worshipping no god andexpressing our true power and potential as expressions of Infinite Possibility?But, no – ‘Satan has deceived people into believing in all other religions –except mine.’ A Christian website proclaimed that ‘Satan is a master ofdeception and half-truths’ and it added that ‘Satan and his demonic forces wantto deceive us and move us [from] a simple child-like dependence in Jesus [to alife of trusting] in our own ways’. But this is exactly what the Demiurge-Archonmanipulators want to happen – people giving away their right to think and nottrusting in their own judgement and perception. They don’t care whatbelief-system you have so long as you have one and it is rigid and immovableenough to lock you in a prison of the mind. The ‘choice’ being offered is toworship a force of malevolence directly through vehicles like Satanism, orindirectly through the worship of religious deities which are symbolicrepresentations of the same malevolence. This two-faced approach can be seenwith the angry, violent and vengeful god of the Old Testament and the apparentlyloving god of the New Testament. Christians somehow have to worship both, forboth are in the same Bible and are proclaimed by the same infallible Word ofGod. The desire to believe at any price somehow filters out this blatantcontradiction. The Bible tells us: ‘For such are false apostles, deceitfulworkers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; forSatan himself is transformed into an angel of light.’ They read this, but theycannot possibly conceive that it could apply to them and the men in frocks thattell them what to think.One face – many masksI read an article by a Christian who sought to expose Judaism and Freemasonry asexpressions of the same evil. It quoted occult researcher William J Schnoebelenwith regard to the Kabbalah, the Jewish book of hidden knowledge: ‘Kabbalism isa system of Jewish mysticism and magic and is the foundational element in modernwitchcraft. Virtually all of the great witches and sorcerers of this centurywere Kabbalists.’ Okay so far, then. The article described Judaism as demonicand said that it had sought to take over the world through Communism. The writerwas confusing all followers of Judaism with the inner core of the secret societythat I called Rothschild Zionism, but it really began to go pear-shaped when hesaid that Communism would have succeeded had it not been for ‘the grace of asovereign God who has blessed the US for centuries’. This would be the same USthat has been waging wars of conquest and mass slaughter throughout those samecenturies, would it? God blesses my country and my religion and not all theothers because, well, it’s my country and my religion. The same Archonticnetworks were behind both communism and the ‘West’ during the Cold War periodand played one against the other to manipulate outcomes and events. As forFreemasons, crikey; they are in big trouble according to the writer. Hebiblically quotes: ‘The day they die they’ll plunge into the depths and fire ofHell to be tormented day and night forever and ever by an angry God.’ This isthe same god that loves you once Jesus shows up, by the way. But, hey, thisevangelical was on a roll now ... have some of this ... 2nd Thessalonians 3:14:‘And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have nocompany with him, that he may be ashamed’ ... and this ... 2nd Corinthians6:14-15:> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath> righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with> darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that> believeth with an infidel?There you go, nothing like a bit of divide and rule to stir the pot. Judaism,Islam, New Age, Baha’i, homosexuals ... none were spared the Gatling gun of thisman’s selfrighteous indignation – ‘Satan has deceived people into believing inall the other religions – except mine.’ The demand not to mix with those whodon’t share the same faith – or even a different version of the same faith – isanother universal trait of the global Archontic religion under different names.This has not only fractured religions and countries into warring factions butfamilies, too. I have seen the remnants of many families over the years pulledapart by the dictates of Mormonism and Jehovah’s Witnesses where believers havebeen told to have nothing to do with non-believers among their own parents,children, brothers and sisters. This is what cults do and this is what we have –one gigantic global Archontic cult using pseudonyms such as religion, secretsocieties and Satanism. The structure of religions like Mormonism and theJehovah’s Witness are satanic at their rotten inner cores. They all are when youget deep enough and they are only Satanism with a public face. Then there is thetried and trusted ‘only way’ scam. This is the claim that the ‘only way’ to godis through Something Or Other. I think Something Or Other must be well pissedoff by now. He must never sleep.> Knock, knock.> ‘Excuse me, are you Mr Something Or Other?’> ‘Yes, have you seen the bloody time?’> ‘Sorry, but I want to find God and they said that I always have to go through> Something Or Other.’> ‘Can’t you go through yourself? I haven’t had a wink – Christians, Muslins,> Jews, they never leave me alone.’> ‘No, that’s not allowed.’> ‘That’s what they all say.’The Christian ‘Something Or Other’ is Jesus and, according to the writer of thearticle I have been quoting, Satan’s biggest deception is getting people to denythat ‘Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to Heaven’. I beg to differ. I don’t needSatan’s help to see that the story of a man born to a virgin mother and whowalked on water, turned water into wine, fed 5,000 from a few loaves and fishes,died on a cross, came back to life in a cave and then floated to up to Heavenfrom the top of a hill while promising to come back on a cloud might just havean exaggeration or two to sift out here and there. I feel it in my water, walkedon or otherwise. It is the same deal with all of them: Christianity: go to achurch and be told what God wants you to do by a man in a frock. Judaism: go toa synagogue and be told what God wants you to do by a man in a frock. Islam: goto a mosque and be told what God wants you to do by a man in a frock. WithHinduism you are told what something like 50,000 deities want you to do. How dothey keep up? Buddhism is supposed to be an ‘enlightened’ religion(contradiction in terms), but they get down on their knees to little boys Figure385: Religions – different names but the same deal. who they believe are thereincarnation of some passed-on religious hero, anyone from the Dalai Lamadownwards. How enlightened is that? A Spanish man, Osel Hita Torres, wasenthroned as a reincarnated Tibetan Buddhist lama when he was just two. Adults,well, in theory, bowed down to him and asked for his blessing. Followers – notefollowers – of a late lama called Thubten Yeshe decided that Torres was hisreincarnation. The baby’s mother, Maria Torres, a Yeshe devotee, agreed to lethim be taken away to a monastery in India. ‘It made me feel very special, thefact that he had chosen me as his mother’, she said. Alas, at the age of 15 orso, Torres was done with the life forced upon him and he eventually returned toSpain where he hit the beach and made plans to be a documentary maker. Welldone, mate. Buddhism is enlightened? And, of course, Buddhism and Hinduism –both Archon religions like all the others – provided the belief-basis of theWestern ‘New Age’ movement which is, like its perception foundations in theEast, yet more fake ‘enlightenment’; it is the worship of deities, goddesses,‘Great White Brotherhoods’, ‘Ashtar Commands’ and ‘enlightened souls’ who aremostly nothing more than the Archons in another guise (Fig 385). At their innercore all these religions are satanic and secretly worship the Demiurge under thecover of being ‘holy’, or holly – the sacred (sacrifice) holly-wood of theSaturn-worshipping, serpent-worshipping Druids. Could it be more blatant thanwhat you see at the Paul VI Audience Hall on the border between the Vatican andRome? This is clearly a reptilian-like demonic image and goodness knows whatgoes on in that place after dark (Fig 386). Something like that would carry thevibration of what it represents and make it much easier to draw those entitiesinto any ritual. The horrible demonic display is called La Resurrezione (‘TheResurrection’) and it is the work of sculptor Pericle Fazzini. The spin saysthat the images represent Christ rising ‘from this crater torn open by a nuclearbomb; an atrocious explosion, a vortex of violence and Figure 387: The ChronosImpersonation Society energy.’ My leg is ringing again and it must be the bells.Satanism is the epicentre of the global cult with all the other parts likereligion and secret societies connecting into that. Possibly 85 percent of theinitiates of secret societies and 95 percent of religious advocates will have noidea that this is so. I see and hear people saying that ‘it’s the Zionists’, or‘it’s the Jesuits’ and having ridiculous and irrelevant arguments over this whenthese organisations and networks are all aspect of one whole – the worship ofthe Demiurge-Archons.[../Images/00367.jpg]Figure 385: Religions – different names but the same deal.[../Images/00529.jpg]Figure 386: This is ‘the resurrection of Jesus’. Yep, and my name is Aunt Fanny.[../Images/00571.jpg]Figure 387: The Chronos Impersonation SocietyHairy moment or something fishy?There are some minor differences between religions which are literally cosmeticas with many Buddhists and others shaving their heads while Sikhs must leavetheir hair uncut. Muslims say they have beards because Mohammed had one nearly1,500 years ago. You see beards connected to a stream of religions and you’llfind that the real origin is the bearded depiction of Chronos, the god of Saturn(with its luminous crescent) in ancient Greece (Fig 387). I guess that HairyKrishna chap doesn’t see much of his barber either. Yes, I know it’s Harry, butwhen I get into religion I need some light relief. Sorry, Hari, not Harry, as inthe wellknown British football manager Hari Redknapp who has never struck me asbeing that hairy. Religions seem to have a thing about hair – a thing abouthaving it or not having it. Or, going half and half with the tonsure when youshave the top of your head to form a ring – just like Saturn (Fig 388). This isa follicle equivalent of the halo. Saints and deities are given halos becausethey are ‘of the light’. Take it a step further and the halo is symbolising thesun; but take the next step of understanding and it is symbolising Saturn – theBlack Sun often portrayed as a circle, wheel or luminous crescent (Fig 389). Thestatue of ‘St Peter’ in Rome is an example as are multiple depictions of Jesus(Fig 390).[../Images/00054.jpg]Figure 388: The bald truth.[../Images/00233.jpg]Figure 389: Oh, halo.[../Images/00052.jpg]Figure 390: Halo one and all.The apparent ‘differences’ between religions have the same origin and representworship of the same manipulating force. The tonsure haircut goes back at leastto the Babylonian priests leading the worship of the various gods of Saturn,Jupiter and all the rest and, as the religion of Babylon became Judaism,Christianity and Islam (which also had a big input from Hinduism), so thetonsure and many other symbols and rituals made the same journey. Babylonianpriests wore the skull cap and so you have the same thing worn in Islam, theRoman Catholic Church and Judaism, where it called a yarmulke or kipa. Hence theEnglish phrase ‘being done up like a kipa’. Actually that’s another attempt athumour. It is really to be ‘done up like a kipper’ and how appropriate this iswhen you see the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury and endless other churchmenwearing the attire of the ancient priests of the fish god cult of deities likeOannes, or Dagon, the ‘Fish of Heaven’. Don’t they also symbolise Jesus with afish? I do believe they do. Fish deities were portrayed with the head of a fishand the Mesopotamian ‘Priests of Dagon’ wore a hat that looked like a fish head.This same hat has come through history to be the Christian mitre – the fish head(Fig 391). You can see the six-pointed star symbol of Saturn on the formerPope’s mitre and one of his other favourite headgear is his ‘Saturn Hat’ (Fig392). The same is true of the secret societies and Satanism. They all have thesame origin and so all use the same symbols and rituals. The Catholic Eucharistwhere they symbolically eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus as bread andwine originates from ancient rituals where they literally did that. Satanistsand the satanic inner core of religions still do. One is the outer and publiclyacceptable version of the other, that’s all. The Body and Blood of Christ duringthe Eucharist are called ‘the Blessed Sacrament’. The term ‘Sacrament’ meanssacrifice if the truth be told. Sacrament comes from sacramentum, a translationof the Greek word mysterion, or mystery. We are back to the ancient Mysteryreligions again. They have just been repackaged in countless guises. RomanCatholics are told that to get to Heaven they have to eat the body of Christ inthe form of ‘bread’ or wafer biscuit which they stick in the centre of a roundobject called a monstrance (Saturn) and sometimes even parade it through thestreets (Fig 393). You can see the close similarity between an ancient symbol ofSaturn featured on the cover of David Talbott’s book, The Saturn Myth, and boththe monstrance and the layout of St Peter’s Square in Rome (Fig 394). So theyhave reduced their focus of Jesus worship in the Satanism-lite Eucharist to thatof a biscuit (Fig 395). First they depict him nailed to a cross everywhere youlook, then they turn him into a biscuit and eat him. Jeeez, hasn’t he sufferedenough? Oh yes, and they drink his blood as a bottle of Chianti; but it isblessed Chianti so that’s okay. I mean, the very symbol of Christianity isstraight out of Satanism – a man being sacrificed and tortured on the cross ofSaturn (Fig 396).[../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 391: The fish-hat gods of Mesopotamia and the fish-hat Popes of Rome.[../Images/00099.jpg]Figure 392: Ratzinger in the Papal Saturn hat.[../Images/00287.jpg]Figure 393: An ancient symbol of Saturn and the Papal biscuit holder. Monstrous.Sorry, monstrance.[../Images/00184.jpg]Figure 394: St Peter’s Square and Saturn symbolism.Imagine what that image must do to people subconsciously and emotionally andwhat kind of energy/entities that would make a connection with. I was in a smallchurch in La Paz, Bolivia once and the walls were covered with a dying man on across being sacrificed. The energy in the place, as you would expect, washorrific. The Jewish religion has the bread and wine deal in the Kibbushceremony on the Sabbath (Saturday – Saturnday). Their cups must hold no more orless than a strictly prescribed quota known as a revi’it. They then eat somebraided bread known as challah. This is covered with a cloth while the winesupping is going on because according to a body of Jewish law known as theHalakha (my god, not another one) the blessing of the bread takes precedenceover the wine. Some say that the cloth is used to ensure that the bread will notbe ‘insulted’ by the wine going first. Hey, slip it some dough, give it a raise,it’ll be fine. I wonder if the bread is half-baked, or whether that refers tothe participants. I think I shall start a new religion inspired by the Catholicbiscuit and worship a Hobnob or a chocolate chip cookie. I shall have my deitydeclaring that life is dictated by how the cookie crumbles. Perhaps this willlead to Hobnobs becoming known as Holynobs (Fig 397). I can only pray and seewhat happens. I shall replace wine with a strong brew of holy tea into which theHolynob can be dipped in a ceremony known as the Sacred Dunk and conducted bythe leader of my religion who shall be known as the Nobhead (Fig 398). This willsymbolise the sacrifice of the Holynob in the name of the Father, bun and holytoast. Finally, at the end of this sacrament, one will sup from the tea filledwith crumbs from the Holynob in a ritual that will be known as the Last Supping.I do hope the Holynob will not feel insulted by this focus on the tea and Ishall be ready just in case. Hey, Ethel – fetch a cloth![../Images/00264.jpg]Figure 395: The Christian deity reduced to the level of a biscuit.[../Images/00062.jpg]Figure 396: What a grotesque image to have as the symbol to your religion.[../Images/00482.jpg]Figure 397: The Nobhead with the sacred Holynob.[../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 398: Think of the sponsorship opportunities.Bridge to BabylonThe foundation beliefs, symbols and rituals of religion, secret societies andSatanism came from the lost continents of Mu and Atlantis and beyond. Survivorsof Mu headed into Asia and South America and then up into Central and NorthAmerica. Survivors of Atlantis went to North America, Europe and the Middle Eastwhere their secret societies eventually fused with those of the former Muansexpanding west out of Asia. This fusion of bloodlines and beliefs became Egypt,Sumer and Babylon. These peoples, with the Archon bloodlines dictating events,moved north to become the Khazars and to establish the City of Saturn – Rome.The Roman Empire took them to Britain and much later the European empires,especially the British, expanded their influence across the world. This isbasically how the Archon rituals, symbols and implanted belief-systemsinfiltrated global religion, secret societies and Satanism. The religion ofBabylon was relocated to Rome in the form of Saturn and other worship. TheBabylonian trinity was Nimrod, the Father god (the Saturn sun); Queen Semiramis,or Ishtar, the virgin mother; and Tammuz or Ninus, the son. It was said thatwhen Nimrod died he became the (Saturn) sun god, Baal – see also Moloch and allthe rest. Babylonian myth said that Nimrod impregnated Semiramis with the raysof the sun and she gave sexless birth to a reincarnation of Nimrod, her ‘son’called Tammuz. Father and Son were one, as the Christians say, and they say thisbecause Christianity is the religion of Babylon relocated and re-launched underanother name. Christianity was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine whoworshipped a deity called Sol Invictus, or the ‘Unconquered Sun’ (Saturn), andhe had no problem with the new religion because it was only his old one inanother form. Nimrod-Tammuz- Semiramis became Father, Son and Holy Ghost, orSpirit. Father God and Son Jesus were straight swaps for Nimrod and Tammuz whilethe Holy Ghost was symbolised as a dove – the symbol of Semiramis in Babylon.All the attributes that Babylonians gave to Semiramis, such as virgin mother andQueen of Heaven, were given her Christian version, Mother Mary. Catholics areworshipping the Babylonian goddess Semiramis/Ishtar in the form of Mother Maryand Christians as a whole are worshipping the Babylonian Nimrod and Tammuz asGod and Jesus. American symbolism researcher Jordan Maxwell says that the word‘Church’ comes from the Scottish ‘Kirk’ which can be traced back to the Romangoddess Ceres (‘daughter of Saturn’) and to the Greek goddess Circe who,according the Greek mythology, hypnotised people and then brought them home,turned them into animals and ate them. Well, makes a change from a beer and atake-out, I guess. The figure of Mother Mary is an incarnation of the virginmother myth going back thousands of years before Christianity. The symbol of themother and child was found in reptilian form in graves of the Ubaid people whichpreceded Sumer in Mesopotamia. This then went on to be symbolised as Semiramis,Isis and other goddess figures (Fig 399). The same Babylonian goddess became theStatue of Liberty (inversion), the goddess on court buildings holding the scalesof justice (inversion) and the Goddess Freedom (inversion) on top of the dome onCapitol Hill. ‘Christian’ festivals come from the same source. Ishtar(Semiramis) became the festival of Easter and the association with rabbits andhot cross buns originates in Babylon. Christmas is the Roman festival ofSaturnalia, as I have already outlined.[../Images/00443.jpg]Figure 399: History is awash with mother and baby deities including thereptilian Ubaid figurines, Babylonian Semiramis, Egyptian Isis and ChristianMother Mary.The Jesus blueprintThere was no Jesus or Christian story. It is all a symbolic fable. ‘Jesus’deities abound in the ancient world and the same basic story was told aboutthem. This is what they said about Bacchus, a Roman Jesus, and his Greekcounterpart, Dionysus:> Dionysus was born of a virgin on December 25th and, as the Holy Child, was> placed in a Manger. He was a travelling teacher who performed miracles. He> ‘rode in a triumphal procession on an ass’. He was a sacred king killed and> eaten in a Eucharistic ritual for fecundity and purification. He rose from the> dead on March 25th. He was the God of the Vine, and turned water into wine. He> was called ‘King of Kings’ and ‘God of Gods’. He was considered the ‘Only> Begotten Son’, ‘Saviour’, ‘Redeemer’, ‘Sin Bearer’, ‘Anointed One’ and the> ‘Alpha and Omega’. He was identified with the Ram or Lamb. His sacrificial> title of ‘Dendrites’ or ‘Young Man of the Tree’ intimates that he was hung on> a tree or crucified.The Romans and Persians also worshipped another ‘Jesus’ in the form of Mithra orMithras – ‘the vine’ and the ‘good shepherd’. Mithra was born on December 25th(the midwinter festival following Saturnalia); he was a great teacher who hadtwelve companions; he performed miracles and was the redeemer, saviour andmessiah; he was called the lion and the lamb and ‘the way, the truth and thelight’. He was worshipped at the spring equinox which relates to our Easter, thetime when it was said that Mithra was ‘resurrected’. Sunday was Mithras Day, orthe Lord’s Day. Mithra rituals included baptism to remove sins, the Eucharistand a sacred meal involving bread, water and wine. An image of Mithra wasdiscovered in the catacombs of Rome. He was pictured as an infant sitting on hismother’s lap with Persian Magi offering gifts. I suggest that the star that theMagi are supposed to have symbolically followed in the Jesus story was Saturn. Imean, it was all meant to have happened during or close to the Roman festival ofSaturnalia and the Jesus stories came out of ... Rome, the City of Saturn. TheRomans also took Mithra worship to Britain and a Temple of Mithras has beenfound in London. The Phrygian god called Attis was said to have been born to thegoddess Nana in a miraculous virgin birth on our December 25th and became theFather and Divine Son. He died under a pine tree, but was resurrected after theintervention of the goddess Cybele (‘Cube’), known in Rome as Magna Mater,‘Great Mother’ and ‘Mother of all Gods’. The legend says that she brought a pinetree carrying his effigy to the sanctuary where Attis lay dead in the period ofwhat became Easter. It was said of his resurrection:> For suddenly a light shone in the darkness; the tomb was opened; the God had> risen from the dead ... [and the priest] softly whispered in their ears the> glad tidings of salvation. The resurrection of the god was hailed by his> disciples as a promise that they too would issue triumphant from the> corruption of the grave.Attis was called ‘the Good Shepherd’, ‘Only Begotten Son’ and ‘Saviour’.Shedding the blood of the bull (Saturn) in the name of Attis on what is todaythe site of St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican was believed to remove ‘sins’.Attis was known as a god of vegetation (a common Saturn-god theme with the Romangod Saturn entitled the ‘god of agriculture’, hence the scythe). You also oftensee the face in the architecture of churches of the ‘Green Man’ who is depictedas the god of vegetation or new life (Fig 400). This is Osiris (Saturn) who wasportrayed in Egypt with a green face. The Wicca religion has the Green Man as ahorned god (Saturn) similar to the god Pan (Saturn). Christian churches areawash with Saturn symbolism because that is the focus of the religion. Theorigins of Christianity can be seen in the centre of St Peter’s Square outsidethe Vatican where there is an original obelisk from Heliopolis, the ‘City of the(Saturn) Sun’ in ancient Egypt. It is placed in the centre of the cross andcircle symbol of Saturn and within a Saturn square and the obelisk was known inBabylon as the ‘shaft of Baal’ which was symbolic of the bloodline. The obeliskhas been ‘Christianised’ by the placement of a little cross, which is nice (Fig401); but in fact, it hasn’t, really, because the cross is not a uniquelyChristian symbol and was used all over the world for at least thousands of yearsbefore Christianity, a religion of hand-me-downs like all the others. Crosseswere used to symbolise Nimrod and Tammuz, the reincarnated Nimrod, or ‘son’, inBabylon. Both are Saturn gods and the cross or X is a symbol of Saturn. We seethe outer Roman Church in the form of the Pope and the public rituals, butbehind it are highly-exclusive secret societies such as the Jesuits, Knights ofMalta, Knights Templar and Opus Dei. They are working with the Archontic occultknowledge for which the public face of the Church is merely a cover. The Churchof Rome is a global satanic network operating behind the smokescreen of‘Christianity’ and its dirty fingers can be found in almost every pie.Washington DC is an example. The city’s architecture is based on Rome, just asthe Roman eagle (phoenix) became the American eagle, and the Roman Senate becamethe American Senate. The British government is talking of changing the name ofthe House of Lords to the Senate. Washington is located on land once called Romeand it was donated by the family of the Jesuit John Carroll, America’s firstRoman Catholic bishop. He was a close associate of bloodline asset and Satanist,Benjamin Franklin, from the satanic Hellfire Club. Washington is located whereit is for energetic reasons and the central area with Congress, the White House,the Washington Monument obelisk, the Federal Reserve building and so on is agigantic satanic temple. Washington DC also has many connections to ancientEgypt in its street plan and the area called Alexandria next to the capitol isthe location the of 333-foot masonic monument to George Washington which isbased on the ancient lighthouse in Alexandria, Egypt, home of Hypatia’s GreatLibrary. The monument is based on three cubes, one on top of the other (Fig402). The Alexandria lighthouse was one of the seven wonders of the ancientworld.[../Images/00534.jpg]Figure 400: The Green Man is the Egyptian Saturn sun god, Osiris.[../Images/00055.jpg]Figure 401: Vatican City – an original Egyptian obelisk standing on a squarewithin a circle.[../Images/00370.jpg]Figure 402: George Washington’s masonic monument.[../Images/00086.jpg]Figure 403: The Pantheon in Rome.Christian-Judaic-Islamic-HinduismThe Old Testament is the product of the same plagiarism/Paganism that we see inthe New. The tale of Moses being found in the bulrushes was told thousands ofyears before in the very similar story of Sargon of Agade (Akkad), the King ofBabylon around 2550 BC and the story of Noah and the Great Flood had the samesource. The Anunnaki of the ancient Sumerian Tablets became the Elohim (‘MightyOnes’) of the Bible and the accounts of genetic manipulation and the creation ofhybrids in the translations of the Tablets became the sons of God [the gods] whointerbred with the daughters of men. Even the name URU-SA-LIM has been found onSumerian and Babylonian tablets and this became the city of Jerusalem which is aprime religious centre for Jews, Muslims and Christians to this day. This isappropriate because all three are connected in so many ways and so are all theiroffshoots and sub-forms, and Hinduism. Islam shares a belief in the existence ofAbraham, Mother Mary and Jesus while Muslims, Jews and many Christian churchmenwear the Babylonian skull cap. All three involve the worship of Saturn, the Moonand the Demiurge-Archons, and all of them apart from Hinduism have turnedmultiple gods into one composite god, or monotheism. The Pantheon in Rome istestament to this. Pantheon means ‘to every god’ but it was turned into a placeof one-god worship by Christians once unofficial paganism had replaced theofficial variety (Fig 403). Jews begin their month with the new moon and havethe Passover on the full moon while the ‘Christian’ Easter is on the firstSunday after the full moon. The pre-Islamic god Sin is widely believed to havebeen a god of the Moon because of his symbol of the crescent, but this is also asymbol of Saturn’s luminous crescent. Sin appears as the Christian sin or sinnerand in Mount Sinai (Sin was the ‘God of the Mountain’) and in the ‘Desert ofSin’ through which the Israelites are supposed to have travelled in the Biblicalfairy tale. One of the centres of Sin worship was Mecca where he became known as‘al-ilah’, or ‘al-llah’, and later ‘Allah’, the god above all others. TheProphet Mohammed and his associates ditched the multiple-god system, made Allahthe only god and added a lot of Hindu influences to complete the package. Thisis what we have since called Islam and there are even big questions about theentire narrative about the life of the Prophet Mohammed. Historical finds haverevealed how Indian empires spread their influence and the Vedic (Hindu) faithinto the lands of pre-Islamic Arabia and founded schools, academies and culturalcentres. The ancient Indian city of Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges in UttarPradesh is one of Hinduism’s most sacred places and among the world’s oldestcontinually inhabited cities. It would strongly appear that the traditions fromVaranasi were introduced at Mecca long before Islam. Both were centres ofworship to the Vedic god Lord Shiva or Siva, and the sacred Black Stone in theKaaba which Muslims kiss and touch on their pilgrimage to Mecca was in factdedicated to Shiva who in Vedic astrology is represented by ... Saturn. Hinduresearchers and historians contend that the ‘Muslim’ Kaaba, the cube symbol ofSaturn, stems from ancient Vedic belief and culture. In Tamil, a classicallanguage of India, Shiva is known as Kabbahliswar. Indian historian PurushottamNagesh Oak wrote:> I was pleasantly surprised to come across a reference to a king Vikramaditya> inscription found in the Kaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian> Peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire. The text of the crucial> Vikramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaaba> shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 of a volume known as> ‘Sayar-ul-Okul’ treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania library in Istanbul,> Turkey ...> ... [Mecca] followed the Varanasi tradition of providing a venue for important> discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there for spiritual> bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in> Arvasthan (Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva)> emblems can be seen. It is the Shankara ... stone [Black Stone of Siva] that> Muslim pilgrims reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba.The annual Vedic gathering that was held every year at the Kaaba temple in Meccawas called the OKAJ and today it is the Islamic Hajj. There were reported to be360 idols inside the pre-Islamic Kaaba which would certainly fit the Hindubackground. Sanskrit inscriptions have also apparently been found in the Kaaba,too. Traditional accounts say that two of the Kaaba idols were Saturn and theMoon. Indian researcher Srimati Aditi Chaturvedi said of the Hindu-Islamconnection:> In 570 AD, the year of Muhammad’s birth, Arabia was a thriving, rich and> varied Vedic culture ... Every household had an idol of a Hindu god or> goddess. There were hundreds of sacred groves, places of pilgrimage, and> temples which were sanctuaries containing images of the entire range of Vedic> gods ...> It is ironic that the man [Muhammad] who brought about such darkness himself> belonged to the Qurayshi Tribe of Mecca. The Qurayshi were particularly> devoted to Allah (Durga) and the famous Shivling [Black Stone] of the Kaaba> Temple. The fact that the Shivling remains to this day in the Kaaba is solely> due to the fact that it happened to be the Qurayshi tribe’s faceless Family> Deity.> As I mentioned before Muhammad’s name itself came from Mahadeva, which is> another cognate for Lord Shiva. Muhammad’s own uncle, Umar-Bin-E-Hassham was a> staunch Hindu and fervent devotee of Lord Shiva. He was a renowned poet and> wrote many verses in praise of Shiva.Chaturvedi lists other Hindu connections to Islam and these are some of them:> • Muhammad destroyed all 360 idols, but could not summon the courage to> completely obliterate the Black Stone or Shivling in the Kaaba. The stone was> so sacred that the man who detested idol-worship ended up kissing the Kaaba’s> main idol.> • Allah’s followers later broke up the stone, but then tried to put it> together again. The stone is now held together by a silver band studded with> silver nails and bears the name ‘Sangey Aswad’ which came from the Sanskrit> Ashwet (non-white or black stone).> • Mohammed’s Islam jumbled up the Sanskrit (Indian/Hindu) words Nama and Yaja> (which meant ‘bowing’ and ‘worshipping’ respectively) into a combination word> ‘Namaz’ and used this to describe his prescribed method of prayer.> • The method of circling around a shrine seven times in a clockwise direction> is an ancient Indian Vedic custom. Muhammad’s Islam decided that the seven> ritual circles should be retained but that people should walk them in the> opposite direction to Hindus.> • Arabic copies of the Koran have the mysterious number 786 imprinted on them> that no Arabic scholar has apparently been able to understand. This ‘magical’> number is the Vedic holy letter ‘OM’.The Kaaba was dedicated to multiple gods (just like Hinduism) before it wasseized by the founders of Islam and since then non-Muslims have been banned.Part of the Hajj pilgrimage ritual is to shave the head (like Hindus do) andsacrifice an animal (of course). Muslims are told to walk around the Kaaba seventimes and Hindus also ‘circumambulate’ or walk around temples to Shiva. Thefirst written record of the Hebrew ‘Oral Torah’, the Mishnah, or Mishna, listsconcentric circles of holiness surrounding the Temple in Jerusalem. The Jewishesoteric and mystical work, on which Rothschild Zionism is largely based, is theKabbalah – Kabb-Allah. This means ‘Cube-God’, or Saturn. There is so muchcross-referencing between Christianity, Islam, Judaism and other religionsbecause they originate from the same source – the Archons. Islamic traditionsays that the Kaaba was built by the Judeo-Christian hero, Abraham, althoughHindus say otherwise. The Bible says that Abraham came from the land of Shinar,or Sumer, and he is claimed to be the father of the Jews, the so- called ‘ChosenRace’ of their ‘god’ (Demiurge/Saturn). Islamic belief contends that the KaabaBlack Stone was taken there by Abraham. The stone is allegedly part of ameteorite that Islam dates to the time of Adam and Eve (i.e. the period whenhumans were being genetically rewired by the Archons). Hinduism may not be aone-god religion, but the outcome is the same. Hindus are told by their leadersand gurus what the gods want them to do and how everything they need to know canbe found in the Hindu holy books. This is in line with the universal blueprintthat you find with all religions. Hinduism has gone hand in hand with the Indiancaste system in a fiercely segregated society based on genetics, just likeArchontic society, and with the outrageous practice of arranged marriages. Manyyoung people have been killed by their own families for having a relationshipwith someone of another caste and all this continues today no matter how muchthe caste system is said to no longer officially apply. How Indian people whosupport this can have the nerve to accuse others of racism reveals a level ofself-delusion that beggars belief. Hinduism has spawned a whole range of otherreligions (different names for the same religion) and is the foundation beliefsystem of the New Age movement in the West. I have been to India and seenwestern New Agers completely mesmerised by these Hindu cults, even wearing thesame tunics and cropping their hair. I hear New Agers say ‘be yourself’, but somany appear to want to be someone else like a Native American or Hindu.[../Images/00191.jpg]Figure 404: Many religions but one god.Religions are Archontic cultsReligion is designed to suppress human individuality of thought and perceptionin favour of group-think and group-program while they are all worshipping thesame ‘god’, or gods, believing they are different (Fig 404). Religions aresimply publiclyoperating cults and these are some of the methods used by cultsto control their members:• Tricking people into joining the cult and accepting its methods and lifestylewithout them fully understanding what they are getting involved in.• Isolating members so they only mix with other advocates of the cult. Demandingabsolute devotion to the cult and deity of the cult and submission to theleadership.• Destroying the members’ self-esteem and sense of self until they areunquestioning pawns of the leadership.• Preventing cult followers from making decisions about their own lives anddictating in detail their actions and behaviour.• Orchestrating group attacks on anyone who questions or refuses to conform.• Getting members to confess their ‘sins’.• Cutting ties to friends and family not in the cult.These techniques can be seen in all religions. How many people who follow areligion know its true history, origins and motivation? Advocates are at thevery least encouraged not to mix outside of their belief-system and some‘faiths’ even demand it. To be a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, etc., meansdevotion to the deity and religion and following the interpretation of ancienttexts by the leadership with no idea where they actually came from. Lifestyleand behaviour is dictated by the texts and their interpretation by the leaders(‘Muslim’ means ‘One Who Submits’). In Judaism this is so detailed I doubt manyhave a single thought that is not delivered by their religious texts (mindprograms). Oh Jehovah, it’s five past three, I must lower my sock by an inch;‘Oh my Yahweh, it’s ten past three and I must place a cloth over the bread rollsbefore I get the vino out.’ I featured a Jewish orthodox group in the North Westof England in Infinite Love Is The Only Truth – Everything Else Is Illusion andhow their lives are dictated by the hour by their religious laws. It isabsolutely beyond belief, but Saturn saw that it was good. We even see religiousadvocates being attacked by their fellow believers for not believing quite asextremely and totally as they do. Sins are confessed to Roman Catholic priestswhen most of the confessions should be coming the other way. Families are partedby belief or non-belief in a religion. They are cults every bit as much asanything cult leader Jim Jones could think up, but they are more subtle andlong-term rather than so extreme over a short period that you can see what thegame is. I have seen the Church of Scientology, made famous by actors like JohnTravolta and Tom Cruise, referred to as a cult. It is certainly a very strangeoperation in my opinion. Scientology was in the spotlight when Tom Cruise wasdivorced by Katie Holmes in 2012 amid talk that Scientology was to blame. Asource who claimed to be a former Scientologist was quoted by Hollywood Life:‘Tom never ever thought that the demure Katie ... would ever see the truth andyes he is terrified – terrified that she will reveal all the manipulation thatgoes on in Scientology. Katie was even told to disconnect from her own family!’The source added:> Ever since she met Tom, she had been living in a prison, she has been living> in hell. Katie will be made to feel like she is being followed, that she is> evil. They want to make her feel powerless and afraid. Thankfully, Katie’s> star status will hopefully keep her safe!> ... Scientology treats celebrities like royalty, but Katie saw how they> treated regular people. They convince vulnerable people who are suffering that> they can save them. But in the end it’s all about control and money. All of us> who have escaped are so incredibly grateful that Katie will not subject her> daughter to this cult which had nothing to do with unconditional love.BBC reporter John Sweeney has had many confrontations with Scientology from thetime that he embarked on his first investigation of their activities. He hasdescribed how he was put under surveillance on both sides of the Atlantic andhow John Travolta called the BBC Director-General directly to complain abouthim. Scientology denied the surveillance, but it was later confirmed when MikeRinder, the head of Scientology’s secret police, jumped ship and admitted whatwent on. He confirmed that Sweeney had been put under close surveillance so thatthey would know wherever he was and who he was talking to. Rinder said that theinformation was reported back to Church leader, David Miscavige, who went onhoneymoon with Cruise and Katie Holmes. Scientology was founded by US NavalIntelligence operative L Ron Hubbard, an occultist who performed his ‘magic’with Jack Parsons, a devotee of Satanist Aleister Crowley. Scientology believesin a ‘space alien Satan called Xenu’, but doesn’t talk about this publicly. Italso gleans the most private secrets of its members through a process called‘auditing’ that involves a form of lie detection (see Confession). These‘audits’ are recorded ‘for technical purposes’ and are available to be used todiscredit anyone who turns against the Church. Former Scientologist Amy Scobeesaid that this happened to her when she left in 2005 to write her exposé book,Scientology: Abuse At The Top. She describes how the confessional booths arefilmed and made available to Cruise’s mate, Miscavige. You can find out moreabout the background to Scientology and its major players at www.xenu.net[http://www.xenu.net].Saturn WorshipReligions are Saturnian from first to last with the focus on countless symbolsof Saturn including the cube, cross and six-pointed star among a stream ofothers. Many altars of the ancients were cubes, as they were in Rome forsacrifices to Saturn, and they would later become the double cube or rectangle.Saturn is about rules, regulation and ritual. Religions are founded entirely onrules, regulation and ritual. They come not from the heart (as institutions) butfrom the head and the belly – low-vibrational emotion. They are about fear,guilt and submission to the same Archontic force that Satanists submit to. A lotof religious advocates will be incensed by me saying this, but that’s theirproblem. I am after the truth, not popularity. The days of the week are namedafter heavenly bodies and gods worshipped by the ancients which fused togetherinto today’s religion. There is Sun-day, Moon-day; Tiw’s-Day (Norse god);Woden’s Day (Norse god); Thor’s-Day (Norse god); Frigg’s-day (Norse god); andSaturn-day. The main day of Jewish worship is Saturn-day and it is the dayassociated with ceremonial and sexual magic. The theme continues in India whereSaturday is called ‘Shanivar’ after Shani, the Hindu god of Saturn. The Hindugod Lord Shiva is also associated with Saturn and is said to have the Moon inhis hair. Shiva is regarded as the Supreme Being with responsibility formaintaining the life cycle (hamster wheel). Barack Obama carries a symbol in hispocket of the Hindu monkey god called Hanuman who is said to have been born ofShiva. This was confirmed when Obama revealed the contents of his pockets on oneoccasion. Hanuman is the incarnation or reflection of the Saturn-connected,Shiva. The Saturn goddess also closely associated with Shiva, is Kali. This namehas the meaning of black, time and death – all Saturn traits. She is ‘The BlackOne’ and is depicted with a protruding tongue. Madonna was mimicking Kali in yetanother of her Saturn-themed performances (Fig 405). Hinduism believes in thelaw of cause and effect, or ‘karma’, and Saturn is sometimes known as the Lordof Karma. I have felt for some while that cause and effect as it is experiencedonly applies within the Archontic Matrix. Many times over the years I have beenasked why the Illuminati bloodline families don’t seem to be subject likeeveryone else to the law of cause and effect or karma no matter how dastardlytheir deeds. Well, maybe we have the answer if karma is a ‘law’ encoded into theMatrix waveform construct and the bloodlines have the ability to override thatbecause they are serving masters that can manipulate the Matrix. But theirconstant ‘karma’ is to return to the Archontic realm and have no means of escapebecause of their vibrational density.[../Images/00560.jpg]Figure 405: Kali and Madonna.You’ve gotta laugh, reallyReligions at their core are an inversion (of course) of everything they aresupposed to stand for. They are supposed to follow the ‘word of God’ when theyactually follow the word of books ablaze with contradictions and inconsistencieswhich mean they have to be interpreted by Church leaders. ‘I think what Godmeant to say’, as American comedian Bill Hicks brilliantly put it. A hilariousexample came when the Church of England announced in early 2013 that it woulddrop its opposition to gay bishops so long as they promised to ‘remaincelibate’. So where does it say that in the Bible? Oh, yes, here it is ...> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was> without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.> And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And men were without> dicks and God said ‘Let there be dicks’ and there were dicks. And God saw that> they were good.> But God said: ‘Keep them to yourself, lads, and don’t put it about.’> And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.So you see that allowing bishops to be gay so long as they keep their trouserson is actually in ‘scripture’. I know that I have changed ‘scripture’ to supportmy point, but in doing so I am only maintaining an age-long tradition ofchanging the text of ‘holy books’ whenever it suits those in power at the time.Another religious tradition is to make as much money as possible and usewhatever means is necessary to do that. The Roman Church is the big daddy withregard to this. ‘Jesus’ was supposed to have thrown the money changers out ofthe temple and it seems they relocated to the Vatican which has faced financialscandal after scandal including the most infamous of them in the early 1980sinvolving the top secret Propaganda Due (P2) Freemasonry lodge in Rome which wasexposed for having many of Italy’s political, Intelligence, banking, legal andmedia elite on its secret books. Future prime minister and media tycoon SilvioBerlusconi was an initiate of P2. These Freemasonic crooks who directed Italiansociety were divided into strictly compartmentalised groups within P2 and thosein one compartment had no idea that the others existed. P2 initiates wereinteracting with each other outside the lodge in their daily work but theydidn’t know that the others were also P2 and this gave those controlling thelodge enormous potential for manipulation. The only ones that knew everyone inP2 were the few aides close to the Venerable Master, Licio Gelli, the Mussolinifascist, close friend of Argentina’s fascist leader Juan Peron and also USPresident and Vice-president Ronald Reagan and Father George Bush. Gelli wasinvited to Reagan’s inauguration. The P2 scandal broke in 1981 and was connectedwith massive corruption and mega theft being exposed at the Banco Ambrosiano ofwhich the Vatican Bank was the main shareholder. Roberto Calvi, the Chairman ofBanco Ambrosiano and dubbed ‘God’s banker’ for his connections to Vaticanfinances, was found hanged in London under Blackfriars Bridge at the entrance to‘The City’ – whose private and secret society-controlled police force dulysought to cover up what really happened. The claim was that he committed suicidebut a long time later it was ruled that he was murdered. Calvi had not only beenhanged, but it was done in a way that was clearly a Freemasonic ritual as awarning to anyone else about what happens if you step out of line. The obviousmurder through poisoning of Pope John Paul I in 1978 after theFreemasonically-significant 33 days in office was all tied in to this because hewas in the process of dismissing the Freemasons and P2 operatives that herealised were running the Vatican. He was the first pope to be born in the 20thcentury and the last pope to die in it, and his was the shortest reign in papalhistory. I have told this story at length in other books and also see In God’sName by David Yallop for the background to the Pope’s murder. All this washappening in a Church supposedly based on the mythical life of ‘gentle Jesus’who preached about peace, turning the other cheek and caring for the poor, whenthe Roman Church and Christianity in general is sitting on a vast fortune inprecious artefacts, trinkets, historical treasures, bank accounts and realestate. The Church of England is the biggest landowner in the UK and itsofficial head is the British monarch who, by definition, is one of the moststaggeringly wealthy people on Earth. The British royal family go to church in alimo from their palaces to worship (but only in theory) a ‘man’ who wanted themeek to inherit the Earth. The fake Christians among the Archontic bloodlinesare all practicing the art of inversion. The truth is that religions areultimately controlled by the blood-sucking Archontic royal, political andfinancial Mafia for the benefit of that Mafia and their non-human masters. Thisexplains why the religions have been responsible for so much death anddestruction, suppression and subjugation. It also explains what happened with P2and why we see headlines like ‘JPMorgan Complicit In Vatican BankMoney-Laundering’, ‘Former “God’s Banker” could blitz Vatican with cache ofsecret documents’, ‘Missing Girl was Abducted for Vatican Sex Parties’ and‘Vatican, Israel to Sign Economic Agreement’. What can you say when the Vaticanwas actually banned from accepting credit card payments in early 2013 because itwas breaching laws relating to money-laundering? Ernst von Freyberg was named asthe new president of the Vatican Bank and then it was revealed that he was alsothe chairman of a shipbuilding company which makes warships. How very Christian.The Vatican has a secret property empire hidden behind offshore companies thatincludes properties in some of the most expensive parts of London, like PallMall and New Bond Street. The property portfolio has been compiled from thefortune (now worth £500 million or $790 million) handed over to the Vatican byMussolini in 1929 in return for papal recognition of his fascist regime. Takesone to recognise one, I suppose. If it wasn’t so serious for so many it wouldall be hysterical – global organised crime hiding behind a bunch of fairystories delivered by men in frocks while wearing fishheads. Religioncollectively is a pantomime, a farce, an absurdity, and yet it is (shakes hishead in amazement) still the greatest form of mass mind control ever invented.The Old Age ‘New Age’Religions are everywhere under many and various names because religions are onlyrigid belief systems or perception programs – and belief-systems are thecurrency of control. Under that criteria mainstream ‘science’ is a religion andso is the ‘anti-religion’ New Age which is basically an amalgamation ofHinduism, cultural beliefs of native peoples with some metaphysics thrown in.The New Age tells people to open their minds but some of the most closed-minded– and closed-hearted – people I have met have been New Age-type believers andpersonalities. The New Age can be Archontic, too, because it is the offspring ofArchontic creations like Hinduism and many beliefs of native peoples thatoriginate from the same source. The New Age ‘stars’ are largely clueless aboutthe forces behind world events – even at the human level – because they are soincredibly uninformed and myopic. I was interviewed for a film called Thrive bythe producers Foster and Kimberly Gamble. The film was released many years afterI was interviewed but was largely well received – except by many of the otherpeople featured in the footage. Thrive is basically about the nature of realityand part of this is the reality of why the world is as it today, but that wasfar too extreme and crazy to many of the New Age and other participants andespecially when it involved HIM – David Icke. These included a bloke called JohnRobbins who apparently writes about the environment and food and believes that‘the science of climate change to my eyes is incontrovertible’. Bollocks it is.Robbins is also an advocate of vaccinations. Anyway, he was so indignant that Ishould be given airtime in the film that he issued an open letter to the Gamblessigned by a list of others – Amy Goodman, Deepak Chopra, Paul Hawken, EdgarMitchell, Vandana Shiva, John Perkins, Elisabet Sahtouris, Duane Elgin and AdamTrombly. Robbins had his knickers in a right twist and declared: ‘We are a groupof people who were interviewed for and appear in the movie Thrive, and whohereby publicly disassociate ourselves from the film. Oh, really? And, yourpoint is? The letter, headed Humanity and Sanity (they’re sane and I’m mad, see)was indignant. It seems that their flabber had never been so gasted:> Thrive is a very different film from what we were led to expect when we agreed> to be interviewed. We are dismayed that we were not given a chance to know its> content until the time of its public release. We are equally dismayed that our> participation is being used to give credibility to ideas and agendas that we> see as dangerously misguided.> We stand by what each of us said when we were interviewed. But we have grave> disagreements with some of the film’s content and feel the need to make this> public statement to avoid the appearance that our presence in the film> constitutes any kind of endorsement.I am deeply hurt. Not being endorsed by Robbins and his mates? Oh, no. I shallhave to take to my bed. But, hey, Robbins was only warming up:> David Icke, who has been called ‘one of the most extreme of all conspiracy> theorists,’ is not a small player in Thrive. In fact, he is featured more> prominently in the movie than anyone other than Foster Gamble. An extended> interview with him, intercut with supporting material, forms much of the> middle section of the film.> Though this is not mentioned in Thrive, Icke is well-known for advocating> utterly bizarre theories, including that the entire world is run by a secret> group of reptilian humanoids who drink human blood and conduct satanic> rituals. Forty-three U.S. Presidents, he says, have been such reptilian> beings, and many of them, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have been> part of global satanic pedophile rings that murder hundreds of thousands of> children a year. I wish I was making this stuff up, but I’m not. This is what> Icke teaches.The research done by Robbins into any of this? A big zero. He can’t evenaccurately report what I have said. Robbins then goes on to link me toanti-Semitism (yawn, yawn) and repeats a list of assumptions based on what thesystem has told him to believe. The man is utterly clueless about the world asit really is and he is typical of the New Ageenvironmental blueprint. They arelike babes in arms and yet more confirmation of the arrogance of ignorance. Muchof the New Age is not about facing the world as it is and having the courage andwill to make a change in immensely challenging circumstances. It is aboutescapism and finding excuses not to face the world as it is. Now what excuse canI give myself? Er, it’s not really like it really is – yes, that’s a good one.Now shut up, I don’t want to hear any more. I have to go to a meeting to stopcows farting and warming the planet. It is not in the least coincidental thatthe smallest audiences that I have had for my information anywhere in the worldwere in Hawaii, where the military mentality meets the New Age. Both are equallyresistant to facing the truth. The New Age and environmental religions – forthat is what they are – attract some of the most unenlightened, self-deceiving,naïve, arrogant, unquestioning, uninformed stupidity at large on Planet Earth.We will see later how vital they are to what is planned by the Archontic Cabal –indeed what is already happening. There are intelligent people in the New Ageand environmental arena – including some in Hawaii – who are aware enough toencompass the reality of the conspiracy. But they are largely drowned out by theadvocates of close-minded escapism. The New Age brings me to one of itsinspirations and guiding lights – what I call the Cultural Time Warp. These arethe successors to ancient native peoples who have continued the traditions andbeliefs of their ancestors over thousands of years. I have no problem with that,but as a source of information and relevance to the world that we live in todaywe have to be very careful about throwing the bathwater in with the baby ortaking the chaff with the wheat, whatever reverse analogy you like. By that Imean that native peoples in a cultural time warp can have some very interestingand relevant information but there is also a whole load of crap in there, too.Discernment is the key. I have gathered a lot of insightful information fromshamans like Credo Mutwa who has the intelligence to see the difference betweencultural relevance and cultural claptrap. During my second trip to Peru with thegroup from around the world we had a Peruvian guide who took us from place toplace and insisted on asking ‘Pachamama’ (Mother Earth or Mother World) forpermission everywhere we went. He was giving blow jobs to coca leaves (longstory) and conducting a whole lot of other rituals usually involving the saidPachamama. I went along with it for a while just to observe what happened, butinside I was saying: ‘What the fuck?’ I am all for respecting the spirit of theplanet, but hold up a second. Many of these rituals of asking for permissionwere at the entrance stones to a ‘sacred place’, but ‘Pachamama’ didn’t put thestones there at the alleged ‘entrances’ – this chap’s ancestors did. When theEarth was in its pre-stone-entrance state did people stop to ask for permissionto enter a place that had no manufactured ‘entrance’? No, of course not. Peopleinteracted with the planet and its energy field in a natural and nonritualisticway. Most of what I call the Cultural Time Warp is not, for want of a word,natural; it is manufactured – it’s just another religion. Human-made stoneentrances to ‘holy places’ and such like come from the same belief-systemfactory as churches and make-it-up-as-you-go-along ‘holy books’. I asked theguide in Peru where most of his customers came from and he said they were ‘NewAgers from America’. Well, the centre of the target was certainly vibrating withthat one. New Agers love the ritual of the Cultural Time Warp and most are inawe of native peoples and traditions, be they Native Americans, Peruvians,whoever. But you have to combine the best of ancient cultures with the best ofthe modern world in terms of insight and information and not take the wholepackage from either. Archontic manipulation has some people in the mind-prisonof the Cultural Time Warp and most of the rest in the mind-prison of the modernworld’s communal reality warp. Either way they are in a mind-prison which is thewhole point of the exercise. I went to an event in London years ago packed withNew Agers when a group of native people from Colombia were appearing. They saidthey had come down from their mountain-top home to tell the world about the timeof transformation. Great. But they spent the night sitting on the stage whilesilently making traditional something or others out of cloth and beads thatlooked every bit like a pizza. Then they left. I went home enlightened only bythe knowledge of how to make a pizza out of cloth and beads and the fact that somuch of the New Age-Cultural Time Warp Global Alliance is irrelevant to theworld that we live ‘in’. A New Ager was aghast and almost outraged many yearsago when I said I didn’t know the details of the Native American Sun Dance. ‘Youdon’t know the Sun Dance? Incredible.’ Funnily enough, all these years later Istill don’t feel deprived in any way. The point is that she knew about the SunDance, but bugger all about anything else and there lies the problem in terms ofthe New Age/environmental perception deception. If you don’t make it yourbusiness to research many subjects and connect the dots you cannot possibly seethe picture, but the arrogance of ignorance convinces you that you can. Ain’tthat right, Mr Robbins, Mr Chopra and all the others?Religion does not always come with men in frocks, altars and hymn books. Pleasebeware. Mind programs are masters of disguise."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00178.jpg]Mass Rituals of the Energy VampiresThe only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.Socrates‘Oh to be in England, now that April’s here’, wrote the poet Robert Browning,but in the ritual-soaked summer months of 2012 it would be more appropriate tosay: ‘Oh not to be in London now that June is here’ ... or July or August. Itwas a summer of mass rituals orchestrated by the Archon bloodline families ofthe global Control System to fundamentally manipulate the globally-importantenergy field of London and, by its knock-on effect, the rest of Britain and thewider world.I emphasise again that the symbols the Archon bloodlines use are informationfields. They may look like flames, all-seeing eyes, people in crowns andpantomime clothes, but they are energy fields that vibrate to certainfrequencies. If the public can be manipulated to energetically connect withthese fields through their focus of attention then a channel is formed betweenthe two through which energy can be vampired (Fig 406). When mass attention canbe manipulated to focus on the symbols (including people like the Queen) thentheir collective electromagnetic fields can be trawled and drained. You onlyhave to stand in an excited or emotional crowd at a sporting event or royaloccasion to feel the ‘atmosphere’ (energy being generated) and people talk aboutfeeling the hairs on their neck stand up. This is caused by the excitement andemotion of the crowd exciting the electromagnetic field and this is what theArchons are seeking to feed off via these events and public rituals. London wasawarded the 2012 Olympic Games which followed the rituals marking the Queen’s 60years as Archontic head of state because of the location and the timing. TheOlympic flame was being carried right across the British Isles on its way to itsglobally-broadcast finale in London at the same time that London and Britainwere embarked on an orgy of worship for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. The Olympictorch carries the major Archon symbol of the flame – the ‘illuminated ones’ whoare illuminated into knowledge that is denied the rest of the population unlessthey make a commitment to find it for themselves. The flame also represents theArchons/Jinn, those made of ‘luminous fire’ and ‘smokeless fire’. The Archonbloodline network doesn’t do random. Everything is carefully organised andcalculated. They are extremely computer-like and with a much greater infusion ofArchon-Reptilian genetics than the rest of the population they express thetraits of those genetics to a far more extreme extent. These include anobsession with ritual and ritualistic behaviour and they do everything accordingto satanic protocol, precedent, tradition (repetition) and in accordance withastrological sequences influencing the Earth’s energy field. The Queenritualistically goes to different palaces in the same period of the year. Thefamily go to Sandringham in North Norfolk at Christmas (Saturnalia); WindsorCastle, a short distance from London, is where you will find them in the periodacross Easter (another ancient ritual named after the Babylonian goddessIshtar-Esther-Eostre; and they retreat to the satanic ritual centre of Balmoralin Scotland during August and September. They were there when Princess Dianadied in Paris in 1997 and the Queen refused to return to London until publicdisgust forced her hand. Most of the rest of the year is spent at BuckinghamPalace in the heart of the energy grid of London. Britain is famous for its pompand ceremony surrounding the Queen and royal family, but these are onlycoverterms for the rituals that vampire the life-force of those who give theirattention to them while their guard (awareness) is down. The Fraternitas Saturni(Brotherhood of Saturn) website says:[../Images/00547.jpg]Figure 406: Symbols are gateways to the mind.> Saturn energy affects collectives because it represents that aspect of reality> which arises from a consensus among human beings. Saturn energy does not> represent truth or absolute reality. It represents a reality that is created> socially, operates within a social universe, and has its greatest effects upon> an individual in a socially defined context.[../Images/00057.jpg]Figure 407: Yet another Queen dress-up ritual –dominated by black and red.You will notice that the colours involved in royal rituals are dominated byblack and red. These are also the colours associated with sacrifice, Saturnworship and Satanism – and the Archonticcontrolled judiciary and legalprofession come to that (Fig 407). Put ‘Queen, royal ceremony, trooping thecolour, William wedding’ into an image search engine and you will see thedominance of black and red. They love to have gold around them, too, anothercolour symbolic of Saturn according to some, and colours – matter because theyare each a distinct vibration, or information field. The Archons seek to controlthe information fields or energy sea with which we are constantly interactingbecause in this way they can manipulate human perception and their mental,emotional and vibrational states. Change the sea and you change the fish. Thepublic celebrations (rituals) for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee directed nationaland global focus (worship) onto the royal personification of the Archon network.This is the same network that controls the very people celebrating and adoringthe Queen and dictates their lives and choices through the financial andpolitical systems, among so much else. But, as Morpheus said in The Matrix:> The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside,> you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.> The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these> people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have> to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of> them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will> fight to protect it.London was chosen for a year of mass satanic rituals at such a crucial time inthe Archontic agenda for global human enslavement because London and Britain ingeneral are at the heart of the global energy grid and so what goes on thereaffects the whole planet. Remember what the channelled information from earliersaid:> As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet, through your> planet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to the acupuncture lines and> meridians in your body. Where two lines cross, you create a vortex, a tiny> vortex if it’s two. The more lines that intersect, the bigger the vortex.> Therefore when you have a chakra you have a large vortex of intersecting> energy. It is the same with your planet.> Where the most lines cross there is the biggest vortex. Now you could say the> plexus in and around the islands you call the British Isles is the hub of the> wheel of plexuses and energies which surround your planet. It has acted in> other times like a fail-safe device. In order to activate these chakric points> upon your planet, the energies must all pass through the central point. They> must pass through the heart of the pattern.Britain as a central point on the planet’s energy grid is a theme I have pickedup many times in the last nearly 25 years. The focus on the British Isles for solong is ridiculous given its size, but its significance comes from its positionon the Earth energy grid and this is why leading Archontic bloodlines locatedhere to orchestrate worldwide developments – including the world-changingBritish Empire and the worldchanging Industrial Revolution – from London andother parts of the British Isles and Ireland. But all this is lost on themillions who worship their own enslavers. I went for a walk during the DiamondJubilee in 2012 and when I returned a neighbour had put Union Flags (‘UnionJacks’) along the railings at the entrance to the flats where I live. The ladywas just walking away when I spluttered my reaction along the lines of ‘Oh, mygoodness, no’.> ‘Come on, David’, she said, ‘get into the spirit.’> ‘I think if people got out of the spirit of things like this’, I replied,> ‘we might live in a freer world.’> ‘Get into the spirit’, she said, ‘we are free enough.’She was speaking for billions of self-deluded people around the world in thatmoment and certainly millions throughout Britain who were worshipping the Queenlike prisoners worshipping their jailers (Fig 408). Hundreds of thousands arereported to have stood and cheered on the banks of the River Thames as the Queenfloated by on the ‘Royal Barge’ amid a 1,000-boat ‘pageant’ (Fig 409). They hadwaited for hours to secure their spot on a cold and rainy day. The BBC, theQueen’s personal broadcasting network, was as unbiased as always. ProfessionalBBC ‘journalists’ fell over themselves to fawn and gush. I started counting thenumber of ‘fantastics’, but there were so many within half an hour that I gaveup. ‘We’re all so excited’, many of them said before the pageant began. ‘Wecan’t wait’, they cried. ‘I’ve never seen the Queen smile so often in such ashort time – wonderful to see’, said one ‘journalist’ about a practisingSatanist. Another BBC ‘reporter’ said: ‘We are all very excited here because wehave just seen the Queen passing by – lots of weeping and whooping.’ Anotherexclaimed: ‘It doesn’t get much better than this.’ Oh, I think it does, youknow. John Sergeant, the BBC’s Chief Political Correspondent for eight yearsreporting on affairs of state, told viewers from his spot on Westminster Bridge,right next to Figure 409: Hundreds of thousands lined the banks of theParliament: ‘We’re cheering the pictures on the big screen – any excuse forcheering.’ He then told the crowd around him: ‘Come on cheer, hooray, hooray.’Huw Edwards, the BBC’s leading newsreader, royal event commentator andprofessional sycophant, would say of another Jubilee occasion later in the week:‘Even the unemployed would be having fun here.’ The truth of what is reallygoing on, and the true background to the monarchy, has got no chance of beingexposed by the BBC and the mainstream media because those who know the truth atthe peak of the pyramid won’t allow it and the sycophantic and/or ignorant‘journalistic’ profession simply don’t know, anyway.[../Images/00144.jpg]Figure 408: The crowd (a massive electromagnetic field) focusses attention andadulation on the symbols of control and suppression.[../Images/00251.jpg]Figure 409: Hundreds of thousands lined the banks of the Thames for the Queen’sriver pageant.The war-wounded worship the war-makersThe River Thames, on which it all happened, is named after the ancient Celticgoddess, Tamesis, and it is called Isis, the virgin mother/queen in Egyptianmyth, in the section of the river that flows through the Archon capital of‘education’ manipulation that we call Oxford. According to symbolism andnumerology researcher Ellis Taylor in his work, In These Signs, the city ofOxford is ruled astrologically (that is energetically) by Capricorn, the sign ofSaturn, and numerologically its number is 108 – the same as Isis, the Moon and‘birthing’. It’s all ritual. The official story is that ‘Thames’ comes from aCeltic word for river, but what they don’t tell you is that their word for riverwas inspired by the name of their river goddess Tamesis, which means ‘dark flow’and is also written as Temesia (Fig 410). So they gathered on the banks of thesnake-like Celtic river goddess as the Goddess of Britain sailed past with thepageant flotilla ranging from rowing boats to working boats, to boats that tookpart in the Dunkirk evacuations in 1940 and plush boats for the Queen and herfawning entourage. Dunkirk happened when Nazi troops and aircraft trappedBritish forces on the beach at Dunkirk in Belgium and an armada ofprivately-owned ‘little ships’ were despatched across the English Channel tobring them home. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, an insider puppet of theforces behind the war, most notably the Rothschilds, delivered at that time hisfamous speech that said ‘We shall fight them on the beaches’. Well, actually,‘we’ didn’t include him. He was going to be evacuated to Canada with the royalsif the Nazis had ever landed. The Second World War, like the First, was amanipulated orgy of mass slaughter orchestrated by the very Archon bloodlinenetwork which very much includes the Windsors. It was so sad to me to watchveterans from both world wars looking through tearful eyes and cheering inhomage to the symbol of the very Archon network that instigated the horror andlasting legacy in injury and the loss of loved ones that those wars entailed.One Second World War veteran, a navy diver who was once blown 60 feet into theair when a torpedo struck his ship, said after cheering and waving from adistance towards the Queen’s barge: ‘It was wonderful. I will never forget it... We have a diamond pageant and a diamond Queen.’ ‘We certainly have’, saidthe BBC reporter asking the questions and delivering the usual propaganda onbehalf of the state. War veterans known as Chelsea Pensioners, in their famousred coats and black hats, met the Queen on the banks of the river while astrange man toddled along behind in a black uniform and with some sort offoliage growing out of his head (Fig 411). Chelsea Pensioners are militaryveterans who give up their army and war pensions to live in a small room, or‘berth’, at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea. They were standing as straight asthey could, chin up, chest out, in deference to the personification of why theyfought, killed, suffered, and made others suffer, in wars engineered for thebenefit of everything the Archon Queen represents. I watched the BBC coveragejust to note what happened and what was said, but I grew giddy with my headalmost permanently shaking. So many people of all ages and backgrounds weredancing to the Archon resonance. The morning of the pageant I drove along theseafront near my home as people headed from all directions for a Diamond Jubileeparade. I saw elderly people in uniform, current service people in uniform anduniformed young kids, the bomb fodder and bomb droppers of tomorrow. PrincePhilip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry were all in uniform (Fig412). Serving your country apparently means wearing a uniform when, in truth,wearing a uniform means serving those determined to destroy your country.Everything is upside down, everything inverted, but it is so apt that the royalfamily is closely associated with uniforms – killing and death. It is what theyand the global network do, or rather, manipulate the population to do for themand to each other.[../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 410: The River Thames snaking down to the sea.[../Images/00386.jpg]Figure 411: The Queen with Chelsea Pensioners.[../Images/00382.jpg]Figure 412: Royal uniforms – ‘You see all those people. They’re the greatunwashed who pay for all this.’All the Queen’s men (and women)The red carpet – the symbol of blood and sacrifice – is rolled out almostwherever the Queen goes and she’s often flanked by men in red and black withmany of them looking hideous and out of time. But it is ‘tradition’ (recurringritual) and so it goes on decade after decade. I learned during the televisioncoverage that the Queen has a ‘Garter Principal, King of Arms’. A what? I justhad to look it up. It turns out that the position goes back to 1415 and the chap(again wearing red at the pageant) is ‘the principal adviser to the Sovereign ofthe United Kingdom with respect to ceremonial and heraldry, with specificresponsibility for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and, with the exceptionof Canada, for Commonwealth realms of which The Queen is Sovereign’. Making surethe rituals conform to ritual law then. The list of positions in the RoyalHousehold and all that goes with it is simply shocking and almost all of themare on the public payroll funded through the taxation of people going throughdire economic straits. Eight hundred lackeys work at Buckingham Palace alone andit was announced in 2012 amid a deepening financial crisis in Britain and Europethat the Queen’s income from the taxpayer would be increased by a whopping20-percent. ‘Grotesque’ does not do the situation justice. Here is just apartial royal lackey list and many of the titles are utterly bizarre andridiculous.Take your time ...Apothecary to the Household; Apothecary to the Household at Sandringham;Apothecary to the Household at Windsor; Astronomer Royal; Astronomer Royal forScotland; Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland; Board of Green Cloth; Butlerof Scotland; Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms; Captain ofthe Yeomen of the Guard; Chamberlain of Scotland; Clerk Marshal; Clerk of theCloset; Deputy Clerk of the Closet; Comptroller of the Household; Coroner of theQueen’s Household; Crown Equerry; Dean of the Chapel Royal; Defence ServicesSecretary; Ecclesiastical Household; Equerry; Field Officer in Brigade Waiting;Flower Painter in Ordinary; Gentleman Usher; Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod;Gentleman Usher to the Sword of State; Gold Stick and Silver Stick; Governor ofthe Military Knights of Windsor; Grand Carver of England; Groom of the Stole;Her Majesty’s Botanist; Her Majesty’s Representative at Ascot; High Constablesand Guard of Honour of the Palace of Holyroodhouse; Historiographer Royal;Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms; Keeper of the Privy Purse; Keeper of theRoyal Archive; Lady of the Bedchamber; Ladyin-Waiting; Life Guards (UnitedKingdom); Gentlemen Ushers; Lord Chamberlain; Lord Chamberlain’s Office; LordClerk Register; Lord High Constable of Scotland; Lord Lyon King of Arms; LordSteward; Lord-in-Waiting; Maid of Honour; Marker of the Swans; Marshal of theCeremonies; Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps; Master Carver; Master of theCeremonies; Master of the Horse; Master of the Household; Master of theHousehold of Scotland; Master of the Jewel Office; Master of the Queen’s Music;Medical Household; Mistress of the Robes; Official Harpist to the Prince ofWales; Page of Honour; Page of the Backstairs; Page of the Presence; Painter andLimner; Piper to the Sovereign; Private Secretary to the Sovereign; PurseBearer; Queen’s Bargemaster; Queen’s Flag Sergeant; Queen’s Guard; Physician tothe Queen; Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the JewelHouse; Royal Archives; Royal Librarian (United Kingdom); Sculptor in Ordinaryfor Scotland; Serjeant Surgeon; Serjeant-at-Arms; Warden of the Swans; Woman ofthe Bedchamber; Yeomen of the Guard; Yeomen Warders.A Clerk of the Closet? Even worse, a Deputy Clerk of the Closet. At least ‘GoldStick and Silver Stick’ appear to have some metallic value, but imagine beingasked what you do for a living and you say ‘I’m a Deputy Clerk of the Closet?’People would say no, don’t piss about, what do you really do? Then there isField Officer in Brigade Waiting. That sounds like a bummer of a job to me. Hemust get really pissed off every day standing around looking at his watch. Maybehe should spend his time keeping an eye on that Groom of the Stole before henicks something else. ‘Privy’ is British slang for toilet, so I guess the Keeperof the Privy Purse must be the guy who carries a few coins in case the Queen iscaught short on a street walkabout. There is a Flower Painter in Ordinary,though I note there are none in Extraordinary, and the royal bedchambers seem tobe real busy places. I had heard. There is also a Marker of the Swans and Wardenof the Swans. Lucky bloody swans, I say. There was once even a position in theRoyal Household called ‘Removing Wardrobe’.‘So you are Removing Wardrobe?’‘Yeah.’‘So you ...’‘I remove wardrobes, yeah.’Do you ever bring any back?’‘Oh no – Bring Back Wardrobe does that.’[../Images/00324.jpg]Figure 413: ‘Her’ everything.[../Images/00391.jpg]Figure 414: Black with his rod and wearing a rug trots over the Masonic floor tosummon do the Queen’s bidding.How outrageous it all is for this focus and finance to be showered on one womanand one family. Members of Parliament, judges, the military, Intelligencepersonnel and even Christian clergy all swear an oath of allegiance to the Queenwhen they take office – not to the people of the country. It’s her parliament,her military, her MI5 and MI6, and her Church. The Queen stands on the blood redcarpet to address her parliament, her clergy and her judges surrounded by hermilitary and her silly men in silly clothes of red, black and gold (Fig 413).The people are said to be her subjects. We don’t even have a national anthem inBritain – we have an anthem to the Queen. The Monarch is purely symbolic? Ohplease. She is the Archontic symbol of state power and she has literal powerbehind the scenes through the so-called ‘Royal Prerogative’. Woe betide anyonethat crosses this satanic deviant. She is the only person who can officiallydeclare war and say when it is over. A session of parliament begins after itsmembers are ‘summoned’ by the Queen in a ritual involving her bloke-in-breechescalled ‘Black Rod’ (Saturn). Black Rod (no, it’s not a chap of African descentcalled Rodney) bangs on the door of the parliamentary debating chamber to tellthe members to get their arses in gear because the Queen has summoned them (Fig414). The door is opened and then slammed in the face of poor old Rod as asymbol, so the official story goes, of parliament’s independence from themonarch. Well, hardly. Rod then bangs his stick another three times and when thedoor opens the Members of Parliament pile out like naughty school kids to hearthe Queen make a speech which talks about ‘my government’. I’ll accept theindependence of Parliament on the day when Black Rod bangs the door three timesand a voice on the other side says: ‘You can tell her to fuck off – we’re notcoming’. I can’t see this happening any time soon, though. The Queen opens a newparliamentary session and dissolves it before a general election. Every act ofparliament requires royal ascent before it can become law. Prosecutions by thestate are done on her behalf in ‘Her Majesty’s courts’. The obsession withreferring to her as ‘Her Majesty’ comes from the meaning of the word – ‘Thegreatness and dignity of a sovereign’; ‘the sovereignty and power of God’;‘Supreme authority or power: the majesty of the law’. The Queen refers to thepeople as ‘my subjects’ and a subject is defined as ‘one who is under the ruleof another or others, especially one who owes allegiance to a government orruler’. The Oxford English Dictionary says that a subject is someone ‘under thedominion of a monarch’ and dominion means ‘control or the exercise of control’.The term ‘sovereignty’ does not refer to the people, but to the sovereign. TheQueen is said to ‘reign over us’ and ‘reign’ means ‘dominance or widespreadinfluence’. The words of the ‘British’ national anthem say:> God save our gracious Queen> Long live our noble Queen> God save the Queen.> Send her victorious> Happy and glorious> Long to reign over us> God save the QueenThe national anthem sang with such gusto by Britons, sports teams and otherrepresentatives involves the people asking to be ‘subject’ to the monarch’sdominance or widespread influence – ‘long to reign over us’. A major facet ofthe conspiracy is to manipulate people to demand their own enslavement. The UKgovernment announced in 2012 that any foreign national wishing to secure Britishcitizenship would have to learn the first verse of the national anthem andanswer questions about the Queen. The pre-fix ‘Her Majesty’s (HM) can be seeneverywhere in Her Majesty’s Government; Her Majesty’s ‘Most Loyal Opposition’;Her Majesty’s Treasury; Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs; Her Majesty’s CivilService; Her Majesty’s Attorney General; Her Majesty’s Armed Services; HerMajesty’s Prisons; Her Majesty’s Inspector of Prisons; Her Majesty’s LandRegistry; Her Majesty’s Passport Office; Her Majesty’s Coroners; Her Majesty’sInspector of Schools; Her Majesty’s Inspectorates of Constabulary; Her Majesty’sStationary Office; Her Majesty’s Coastguard ... on and on it goes. Sheofficially owns the government and the political opposition to the governmentand the sources of revenue and taxation. British ambassadors all over the worlddon’t officially serve the government or the country, but the monarch as HerMajesty’s ambassador to this or that. It is she who must invite world leaders tomake a state visit to Britain and she is commander-in-chief of the armed forcesjust as the President is (officially) in the United States. She is head of theChurch of England like all monarchs since the 16th century. The monarch’s faceis on the stamps, banknotes, and coinage. Symbolic role, my arse. The Britishgovernment was forced, kicking, screaming, cussing and spitting in early 2013 toreveal the extent to which the Queen and Prince Charles were asked to give theirconsent to legislation and it included proposed bills on royal powers and theinterests of the Crown and the Prince’s Duchy of Cornwall, higher education, IDcards, changes to child maintenance, national insurance, paternity pay, the DataProtection Act, the Housing Act, increased tuition fees for students andlegalising civil partnerships. The Freedom of Information document, releasedafter a 15-month battle to keep it secret, further reveals that the Queenrefused to consent to a Private Members Bill which proposed to transfer thehistoric powers to declare war from the Monarch to Parliament. These are onlysome of the consents requested formally. The real power of the royals comesoff-the-record. Ritual as usual reveals where the power lies. Are you expectedto bow or curtsy to a member of the official government? No, but they are to her(Fig 415). So where does the real power lie? Experts on royal protocol (ritual)say: ‘Never turn your back on the Queen, and never leave the room before shedoes’. Overseas diplomats are given strict instructions about keeping to the‘protocol’ (ritual) when they meet her. I read that letters to the Queen and herfamily, via the Royal Household, must refer to Her Majesty, His Royal Highnessor Her Royal Highness. Letters for the Queen must use the phrase ‘May it pleaseYour Majesty’ and signoff with ‘I have the honour to remain, Madam, YourMajesty’s most humble and obedient servant.’ Jeeez ... after you with thesickbag. The protocol of meeting the Queen is described thus:[../Images/00091.jpg]Figure 415: Prime Minister Cameron reveals the true power dynamic between the‘people’s’ government and the monarchy.> Once you have been presented, you are faced with the question of what to say.> The Queen is always addressed as ‘Your Majesty’ on the first count and> thereafter as ‘Ma’am’; according to Buckingham Palace, this should rhyme with> jam, not palm. Other members of the royal family are treated with similar> respect: ‘Your Royal Highness’, then ‘Sir’ or ‘Ma’am.’ You should let the> royal personage lead the conversation, not try to change the subject, and ask> only the politest of questions. ‘Is Your Majesty enjoying the performance?’ is> acceptable, but ‘How’s Philip and Charles?’ is most definitely, absolutely out> of the question.> When referring to The Queen, ‘The Queen’ is fine, though if you want to be> certain of being polite I would recommend at least once saying ‘Her Majesty.’> It is also quite rude to refer to Prince Charles, Prince Philip, or Princess> Anne; instead, you should opt for The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Edinburgh,> and The Princess Royal. ‘His Royal Highness’ or ‘Her Royal Highness’ may also> be used, though be sure to qualify whom exactly you are referring to ...It is all Archontic-Reptilian ritual. And, of course, complete bollocks.Ringing the BaalThese people and the system they represent are obsessed with ritual – one of theacknowledged traits of the reptilian brain, or R-complex, within the humanbrain. Given that these people have far more Archon-Reptilian genetics, they arefar more obsessed with ritual and ritualistic behaviour. The term Jubilee isbelieved to derive from the Latin Jubilaeus via the Hebrew words yobel andyobhel, which means ram. The Hebrew Jubilee, or what became known as Yovel, wasbegun with a blast on an instrument made from a ram’s horn (Fig 416). The boatleading the Jubilee pageant on the Thames was called the Belfry and carriedeight enormous church bells, each one named after a senior member of the royalfamily and newly-cast for the occasion. Eight bells has occult significance asmarking the ending or beginning of something and the bell is a symbol of Saturn,as in the Saturn god known as Baal, or Bel. This is why we have Christmas bellsand jingle bells during the modern day Roman festival of Saturnalia. There areother reasons, too, for the association of Saturn with bells, including thevibration generated by some bells within the Saturn (Matrix) frequency. Bellringers stood by in churches along the river to set their bells peeling in(vibrational) unison as the Belfry sailed past. Bells can be used to open andclose the ‘sacred circle’ (sac-red = sac-rifice) and invoke the goddess,according to occult lore. The Liberty Bell (inverted meaning) in the UnitedStates in the major Freemasonic centre of Philadelphia has as much to do withLiberty as the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of the Goddess of Babylon that wasgiven to New York by French Freemasons who knew what it really represented –control. Inverted symbolism is everywhere. The pageant ended at Tower Bridge, or‘Twin Tower’ Bridge (Saturn) with fireworks and the drawbridge raised in tribute(Fig 417). The Queen’s barge passed St Paul’s Cathedral close to Tower Bridge.The Cathedral was designed and built by Freemason initiate Sir Christopher Wrenon an ancient site of goddess Diana worship and this was where Princess Dianawas ritually married to Prince Charles before later being ritually sacrificed inthe ‘passage of the moon goddess’ in Paris. St Paul’s is located on top ofLudgate Hill, named after the Celtic god, Llud, and a temple dedicated to himonce stood on the site. Llud was the god of the Thames just as Tamesis was thegoddess. St Paul’s is a very significant location for El-ite occultists like theQueen and it was no surprise that one of the major events of the Diamond Jubileetook place there. It stands within ‘The City’, the globallyimportant financialcentre and unofficially a state in its own right with its own government andpolice force. The Queen and ‘The City’ are fundamentally connected and what isknown as ‘The Crown’ is far more than the monarch. It is a whole network ofSaturn-worshipping secret societies based in ‘The City’ and the adjoiningdistrict, ‘The Temple’, which is the headquarters of the legal system. The word‘crown’ comes from Chronos or Kronos, the Greek god of Saturn, and its literalexpression on the head of the monarch depicts the rings of Saturn. ‘The Temple’district refers to the Temple originally built by the Knights Templar whichfeatured in The Da Vinci Code. This is located in the centre of the legaldistrict and the area is divided into legal entities called the Inner Temple andMiddle Temple. The judiciary and legal profession is controlled by a network ofsecret societies that protect ‘The System’ from public challenge. The majorsecret societies in ‘The City’, including the Knights Templar, are overtly orcovertly connected to Rome and the Roman Church for the historical reasons thatI explain in other books. This means they will be founded on the worship ofSaturn. London Mayor Boris Johnson joined the Queen’s pageant on the Thames, butthe man alongside him was David Wotton, the Lord Mayor of the City of London,and he will be far closer than Johnson to the real power structure. Lord(Demiurge-Saturn) Mayors of London are invariably High Freemasons given that theso-called ‘Square Mile’ financial district is utterly controlled by secretsocieties. The Lord Mayor is actually a head of state because The City is avirtually autonomous ‘city-state’ in the mould of the Vatican and Washington DC.The Lord Mayor is given cabinet level status overseas. I have been told manystories by people claiming to have been forced to take part in satanic ritualsunder the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor. The status ofthe Lord Mayor and The City can be seen in the ritual enacted when the Queencomes to visit. She must wait at the ‘gates’ to The City to ask the Lord Mayorfor permission to enter. Today the ‘gates’ where this takes place are at TempleBar where The Temple district meets The City and pride of place at Temple Bar isgiven to a flying reptile, just as the emblem of The City is two flying reptilesholding the symbol of the Knights Templar, which became the flag of England(Figs 418 and 419). However they may try to spin this Temple Bar ceremony, itreveals the relationship between The City (‘the Crown’) and the monarch who isonly a part of what is termed ‘the Crown’. Everything is ritual to these peopleand it would not happen unless it had a significant meaning within the hiddenArchontic hierarchy.[../Images/00377.jpg]Figure 416: The Queen’s Hebrew Jubilee.[../Images/00563.jpg]Figure 417: London’s twin towers.[../Images/00567.jpg]Figure 418: The winged reptile at Temple Bar...[../Images/00064.jpg]Figure 419: ... and the emblem of The City –two winged reptiles holding theemblem of the Knights Templar.Lickers and lightsFew groups of people are more sycophantic about the Queen and the royal familythan the entertainment industry. I have seen them lining up, bowing andcurtsying, fawning and licking since I was a kid. It made my skin crawl eventhen and it was on display in abundance at the Diamond Jubilee music concert forthe Queen just outside the gates of Buckingham Palace and broadcast live by thecap-touching BBC. The stage was built around the Victoria Memorial whichincludes a statue of Queen Victoria and is dominated by a winged (fallen) angel(Fig 420). This and other (fallen) angels on the structure are officiallydedicated to Justice, Truth and Charity, but the Archontic inversion andreversal makes them represent injustice, lies and meanness – the royal familyexactly. Sir Paul McCartney (‘Sir’ is a word meaning ‘snake’) sang the Beatlessong ‘All My Loving’ to the Queen (what would John Lennon say, or would he becrying too much to speak?). Stevie Wonder sang ‘Isn’t She Lovely?’ and ‘Sir’Elton John went with ‘Your Song’. Yuk. But there was some great synchronisticsycophancy when Elton John then sang ‘Crocodile Rock’. As Scottish comedian,Frankie Boyle, said on Twitter: ‘Crocodile Rock to a family of lizards’. RobbieWilliams sang ‘Mac the Knife’ which was appropriate given their extracurricularactivities, as was ‘Delilah’ by Tom Jones – ‘I felt the knife in my hand and shelaughed no more’. Then a group called Madness performed on the roof ofBuckingham Palace. Who said synchronicity is a myth? On the same night while theconcert was going on some 4,200 ‘beacons’ were lit all over Britain and thecountries of the Commonwealth. These countries were once called colonies and nowthey are known as members of the Commonwealth, but in all the fundamentalslittle has changed. We had black singers from the Commonwealth at the concertcelebrating the institution that enslaved their countries and ancestors, notleast during the reign of Queen Victoria on whose memorial they were performing.Among those lighting a Commonwealth ‘beacon’ was Australian Prime Minister,Julia ‘Cold Eyes’ Gillard, who will be absolutely no stranger to torches, flamesand cauldrons (Fig 421). There were also beacons at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset,a major vortex where the Michael and Mary lines cross, and at the DashwoodMausoleum at West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, a serious satanic ritual site that Ihave exposed in other books (Figs 422 and 423). The Mausoleum stands on top ofthe cave network established for the rituals of the satanic Hellfire Club ofArchon bloodline government minister and aristocrat, Sir Francis Dashwood (15thBaron le Despencer) and American Independence hero, Benjamin Franklin, who wasactually a covert agent for the British Crown all along. The Crown wanted theAmericans to have fake independence so they could replace overt control with thefar more effective covert control. These two Satanists revised the ChristianBook of Common Prayer. This would appear to be ironic until you consider thetrue background to Christianity. I have been in the Hellfire caves at Wycombe(Wicca) because they are open to the public during the day as a touristattraction. They are truly horrible and you can just feel the entities in theunseen all around you. I was told that the Freemasons on the Isle of Wight whereI live had built one of the Jubilee beacons on the beach and I went down to takea picture of it (Fig 424). Look familiar? The Queen used a crystal diamond toactivate the mechanism that lit the final beacon in the global sequence next toBuckingham Palace (Fig 425). Energetically, the sequence around the worldcentred the power in London before the next flame ritual, the London OlympicGames, opened a few weeks later. Those who used the Diamond Jubilee as an excuseto have a few beers and a street party without the keen focus on the Queen willstill have been energetically caught in the web – everyone is to an extentunless they are consciously aware of what is happening. Awareness is protectionbecause it brings the effect out of the subconscious to the attention of theconscious mind. This attention on the event as an energy-sucking ritual blocksits effect. The ones most locked in the web of energetic vampires on theseoccasions are those who give their blind focus of worship and adoration to theQueen and the major members of the royal family who are symbols, and thereforeenergetic doorways, for those in the unseen that mercilessly manipulate andvampire human society. Prince Charles attended the ritual events for the Jubileeand then headed immediately for his home in Transylvania where Bram Stoker sethis Dracula novel published in 1897. This was based on Vlad the Impaler, therelative of Prince Charles and the Queen.[../Images/00229.jpg]Figure 420: The Victoria Memorial and the Jubilee music event.[../Images/00265.jpg]Figure 421: The beacon is lit in Australia.[../Images/00070.jpg]Figure 422: The Jubilee flames on Glastonbury Tor.[../Images/00371.jpg]Figure 423: The Dashwood Mausoleum right above the Wycombe caves, theheadquarters of the satanic Hellfire Club.[../Images/00323.jpg]Figure 424: The Masonic pyramid beacon at Ryde, Isle of Wight.[../Images/00416.jpg]Figure 425: The beacon fire ritual concludes with the lighting of the flameoutside Buckingham Palace.The sacred (sacrificial) fireWhen people focus on a bloodline-inspired flame they are making an energeticconnection with the entities that the flame represents. Fire can be aninterdimensional doorway because of its vibrational range that spans a wide bandof frequency. This is why psychics can look into flames and see events beyondthe ‘physical’ and why fire is used in various forms like candles and torches insatanic and religious ritual. Nostradamus (‘Our Lady’ in Latin) is said to havestared into candlelight when he was receiving his prophecies, or ‘quatrains’.The ‘fire wand’ is used to conduct many occult rituals and fire is used in therituals at Bohemian Grove in northern California where the Archon bloodlines ofAmerica and wider afield attend the ‘summer camp’ every year. Fire is veryprominent in the opening Cremation of Care ritual, which features what theyclaim is a ‘mock’ human sacrifice under a 40-foot stone owl, the ancient symbolof the Saturn god, Moloch, to whom the ancients sacrificed children in fireduring rituals often involving the six-pointed ‘star’ of Saturn which was alsoused in similar rituals to the sun god Baal (Saturn). The theme of fire is aconstant in bloodline symbolism and I am convinced that the Archon-Reptilianscan enter our reality through fire in the right circumstances. It acts as aportal and energy source to make the transition. The Arabian-Islamic Jinn, orDjinn, are said to have been created from ‘smokeless fire’ and Gnostic texts saythat the Archons came from ‘luminous fire’. The ancient Greeks symbolised thesalamander as a creature associated with fire. The name translates as ‘firelizard’. Salamanders in the literal sense are very similar to lizards althoughdesignated as amphibians, but this is not the same concept of salamanders thatthe Greeks had ‘fire lizard’. with their fire lizard symbolism. Their salamanderwas a mythical creature which, according to the dictionary definition, was‘generally resembling a lizard [and] believed capable of living in orwithstanding fire’ (Figs 426 and 427). Salamanders of myth are described by someas ‘fire elementals’ and in the same category as fairies, elves, devas,brownies, leprechauns, gnomes, sprites, pixies, banshees, goblins, mermaids,trolls, griffins and dragons – which are themselves associated with fire, as infirebreathing dragons. These spirits are said to be governed by ‘Archangels’,but what do these terms really represent? We have seen from the work ofresearcher Michael Mott in his book, Caverns, Cauldrons, and ConcealedCreatures, that stories about these figures of folklore fit remarkably with theaccounts, techniques and goals of the Archons and their associated entities. TheJewish Talmud describes the salamander as a product of fire and says that anyonesmeared with its blood will be immune from harm by fire. Shlomo Yitzhaki(1040-1105), better known as Rashi, was a French rabbi known for hiscomprehensive commentary on the Talmud. He said that the salamander could beproduced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years. Could he have beentalking about fire rituals that cumulatively opened a portal? Muhammadal-Bukhari (810-870), a famous Sunni Islamic scholar in Persia, describedsalamanders as ‘mischief-doers’ and said they ‘should be killed’. None of thissounds like a literal salamander but rather the fire lizard version of theGreeks. The Jinn are described as ‘mischief-doers’. Writer and poet Edward Young(1681-1765) wrote of ‘souls made of fire, and children of the sun, with whomrevenge is virtue’. Only he knows what he meant by that, but ‘revenge is virtue’encapsulates the predator’s mentality. Leonardo da Vinci, an initiate ofesoteric knowledge, also used the term ‘virtue’ in his description of thesalamander: ‘This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire inwhich it constantly renews its scaly skin.’ He had to be referring to themythical version of fire lizard because literal salamanders don’t have scalyskin. The bloodlines profusely employ fire in their language of symbolism.Hieroglyphics, for example, is the image-language of their Archon ‘gods’. Theflame or torch is the obvious one, but there are others like the ancient conceptof the phoenix and the Greek god, Prometheus, who is said to have been a Titangod who stole fire from other gods. What did this fire symbolise? Was itknowledge in general, or the knowledge of how to manipulate life and the essenceof life – the fire of life? Some say it: was even the means to generateelectricity and there is considerable evidence that this was done in the ancientworld when structures were being built of such size and complexity that we wouldstruggle to build them today. We also have the fiery reptilian eye in Lord ofthe Rings, the Eye of Sauron, and the fiery eye in the Saturn performance byMadonna at the Super Bowl. Shiva, the Hindu god associated with Saturn in Vedicastrology, is symbolised by fire, and the phoenix is the firebird under manynames in the mythologies of Egypt, Rome, Greece, Arabia and Persia, China, Indiaand other ancient cultures. One theme of the phoenix is the ability to be rebornfrom its own ashes and so live forever (Fig 428). The phoenix has for thisreason come to symbolise death and resurrection, as did the snake or lizard inplaces like Rome. The phoenix, or Benu bird to the Egyptians, was closelyassociated with the Saturn sun god Osiris and with the Central Americanfeatheredserpent god, Quetzalcoatl. The Greeks gave it the name phoenix, whichmeans purplered or crimson. The Benu bird or phoenix is said to have lived onthe Benben stone at Heliopolis and the stone is believed to have been theinspiration for later obelisks and the capstones of pyramids. The symbol of thephoenix evolved into the eagle and they are pretty much interchangeablesymbolically. Manly P Hall, the high Freemason and leading Freemasonic andoccult historian, wrote in his classic work, The Secret Teachings of All Ages:[../Images/00056.jpg]Figure 426: The salamander or ‘fire lizard’.[../Images/00194.jpg]Figure 427: The mythical salamander was believed capable of living in orwithstanding fire.[../Images/00185.jpg]Figure 428: The Archon phoenix.[../Images/00337.jpg]Figure 429: The two-faced Masonic eagle.> European mysticism was not dead at the time the United States of America was> founded.

Their pyramid and all-seeing eyeis on the reverse of the Seal and maybe, in the language of inversion, that isreally the front. The eagle/phoenix can be seen in Freemasonic symbolism withthe double-headed eagle – looking both ways, or being ‘two-faced’ (Fig 429).This is incredibly symbolic of their modus operandi of always saying one thingwhile meaning another and the two faces also relates to the two-faced god knownas Janus which Saturn-symbolism researcher David Talbott insists comes from thelight and dark sides or ‘faces’ of Saturn as they appeared from Earth before thecataclysm (Fig 430). Nations featuring the eagle/phoenix on their flags orsymbols of the country include Albania (double-headed eagle), Austria, Egypt,Germany (presidential flag), Iraq (coat of arms), Montenegro (double-headed),Poland (presidential flag), Portugal, Serbia (double-headed), Mexico, Thailand,Virgin Islands and Zambia. There are, of course, the American eagle and theGerman eagle which both originated from the Roman eagle, or eagle/phoenix, asthe bloodlines expanded their influence. Another major Archon network symbol isPrometheus after whom a major film was named in 2012 with a storyline based onhumanity being seeded by an extraterrestrial race. The main elements of themyths and legends about Prometheus are found all over the world under differentnames. The Greek Prometheus was a ‘trickster god’, one of many versions of thistheme in which the deity ‘breaks the rules of the gods or nature’ in the form of‘tricks’. This is precisely the trickster god symbolism that I associatedearlier with the Archons who are described by the Gnostics in these terms. ThePrometheus ‘trickster’ in Native American myths is the coyote or the raven. Itis the same with many other countries and cultures including Celtic, Norse andEastern European mythology. Once again, as in the case of a salamander, I amtalking about the mythical version, not the literal. The coyote and the ravenare both trickster deities that can shapeshift and take either male or femalehuman form. They are said to have stolen fire from the gods – exactly what wassaid by the Greeks about Prometheus. The trickster archetype in general isassociated with magic, alchemy and ‘creating realities in the duality of timeand illusion’. Some are said to be the creators of humanity. The trickster issaid to move in and out of time (our reality) and his/her symbols include keys,clocks and masks. Put all this together and you can see how the symbolism ofPrometheus and taking fire from the gods could relate to the creation of the badcopy of the original reality – the Matrix.[../Images/00159.jpg]Figure 430: Janus.The Archon heroPrometheus is given a positive spin with the line about stealing fire from thegods and giving it to humans. Fire in this case is usually taken to beknowledge, but who and what does Prometheus really symbolise? Well, for sure notsomething good for humans if he is a hero of the Archon bloodlines and hisstatue is given pride of place at the Rockefeller Center in New York (Fig 431).Myths say that Prometheus created humans from clay – the same as ‘God’,(Archon-Reptilian ‘gods’), in Genesis. Some myths say that he introduced theform of animal sacrifice used in Greek religious (satanic) rituals. Mary Shelleysub-titled her famous book, Frankenstein, published in 1818, The ModernPrometheus. Her husband was the writer and poet, Percy Shelley, who waswell-versed in what hides behind ‘the system’. Percy Shelley was the author ofthe ‘Rise like lions’ poem that I featured in Human Race Get Off Your Knees. Thestory goes that humans already had fire, but the god Zeus, king of the Olympiangods, removed it before Prometheus stole it back. His punishment was to beeternally bound to a rock where an eagle (Jupiter), the symbol of Zeus, fed onhis liver, which grew back every day. Prometheus ‘suffered for humanity’ and soin that way he is another strand of the Jesus myth and there are manysimilarities between Prometheus of the Greeks and the Judeo-Christian concept ofLucifer. Prometheus stole the flame or light from the gods and Lucifer is calledthe ‘light bringer’, or ‘light-bearer’. Prometheus was cast out and chained to arock while Lucifer was cast out of heaven. Lucifer/Devil/Satan are often used asinterchangeable names and we can add the Gnostic version of the Demiurge. Jewishsynagogues represent their god as a bright flame and Hillel, their name forLucifer, means ‘bright light’. The Archon bloodlines and the satanic and secretsociety networks worship their ‘god’ through these various names for the sameforce which in the end refer to the Demiurge-Archons-Reptilians and the Dark Sun– Saturn. They appear to believe that the ‘Devil’, in the form of the serpent,set humanity free in the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden through thegift of knowledge – ‘to know good and evil’. Now, let us take a breath here.Prometheus and Lucifer are both ‘gods’ that brought the flame or light tohumanity and the serpent is supposed to have done something similar in theEden-type myths. This seems to be a good thing at first sight and so Prometheushas become a bit of a hero. But the bloodlines and their secret society andsatanic networks worship the force that Prometheus, Lucifer and the serpentrepresent. And they have a fierce hatred for humanity and absolutely no desireto hand over knowledge beyond that which allows them to be effective servantsand slaves. Surely, this is a blatant contradiction? Unless ... unless it isjust another monumental case of inversion and reversal as I outlined earlier –what we call ‘light’ is the Matrix, the fake reality. When you come from thisperspective you can see immediately why the light-bringer contradiction is notactually a contradiction. The question is why would Prometheus, Lucifer, and allthe names for the same entity or force be ‘light-bringers’ (perceived to be goodbecause light is good, right?) while at the same time they are feted andworshipped by the Archon bloodline ‘El-ite’ that has nothing but hostility andhatred for humanity? The answer is that what we call light is the prison, theMatrix, and the light-bringers are symbolic of those that ‘brought’ it –switched on the Matrix by stealing the knowledge of how to do so (create lightor ‘fire’) from those with more expanded awareness. What is it the biblical‘God’ (the Lord Archon/Demiurge) says right at the start of the Bible text? ‘Letthere be light’. I suggest that this is describing the moment when the Matrixwas ‘switched on’. Let there be the Matrix and there was the Matrix. This is thefoundation bollocks from which all other bollocks are made manifest. The Archonbloodline flame represents many things in one. Fire is an inter-reality doorwaythrough which the predators can enter our world (Fig 432). This is why fire isso much a part of ancient and modern satanic ritual and it makes sense of thosewho see demonic entities in flames and smoke – including the World Trade Centeron 9/11.[../Images/00279.jpg]Figure 431: Prometheus at the Rockefeller Center.[../Images/00326.jpg]Figure 432: Fire is an inter-reality doorway for the ‘smokeless fire’ Archons.May Day, May DayThe Archons are vampiring energy at all large gatherings of people which theycan manipulate into a low-vibrational state - such as hostile, aggressive crowdsat sporting events – and on any occasion where the assembled can be focused onpersonifications and symbols of the predator force. One blatant example was whatI called the London-Rome Beltane Ritual in late April and early May 2011. I havewritten about this in more detail in Remember Who You Are and there is a90-minute video on my website, Davidicke.com [http://www.Davidicke.com], calledThe London-Rome Beltane Ritual which I made during a visit to Rome while it wasall going on. If you watch that video, remember when I mention the sun that I amtalking about Saturn. I had been invited to speak in Rome many months before andthe timing was great because it meant that I would be out of England when theroyal wedding was happening on April 29th between the Rothschild bloodlinesPrince William and Kate Middleton. The period between late April and May 1st isone of the two most important satanic ritual periods of the year. This isBeltane in the northern hemisphere. Shocking numbers of people, most of themyoungsters or children, are sacrificed to the ‘gods’ by these crazies at Beltaneand Halloween. This is not to be confused with those who celebrate Beltane asthe reawakening of nature. The two are not the same thing as satanic ritualalthough many Christians seem to fuse them together in the same condemnation.The royal wedding focussed mass attention on the Archon bloodlines and theirsymbols and at one point the ritual was so in-your-face that a leading member ofthe clergy greeted the Queen outside Westminster Abbey wearing an invertedpentagram within a circle on his back (Fig 433). I went back to the original BBCfootage to make sure it wasn’t a Photoshop job and it wasn’t. The Queen and theother royals arrived at the twin-towered Abbey to the usual symbol of bloodsacrifice, the red carpet, laid on the Abbey floor of black and white squares –the same as Freemasonic and other secret society temples and places of ritual.Black and white squares (Saturn is known as the Black Square) are common to manyCathedrals and major churches because of the way they attracts a certain type ofenergy (Fig 434). Heaving crowds once again turned out to worship the couple,the Queen and the rest of the Addams family and unknowingly offer their energyand life force in sacrifice to the gods. Three of the major centres for Druid‘magic’ in the days of the Celts (and now modern Satanism) were the Isle ofWight, where I live off England’s south coast; the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea;and the Isle of Anglesey just off the north-west coast of Wales. William andKate did not have a honeymoon after the wedding, but they did spend theirwedding night for whatever reason on the Isle of Wight at a hotel that I havementioned in other books. They have also lived on the Isle of Anglesey whereWilliam is stationed with the Royal Air Force. I was told by a survivor of‘care’ home abuse how he was forced to attend a satanic ritual on Anglesey thatinvolved a Conservative government minister. The couple were also given a houseby the Queen on the deeply satanic Sandringham Estate in Norfolk where PrincessDiana was brought up. All the best, Kate.[../Images/00257.jpg]Figure 433: The inverted pentagram of Satanism at the royal wedding.[../Images/00368.jpg]Figure 434: The Masonic floor at Westminster Abbey and the same with manycathedrals and churches.I was so glad to be out of Britain while the wedding was happening, but Iarrived in Rome to another major ritual on May 1st, the most important day ofBeltane, and this time orchestrated by the Vatican. May 1st, or May Day, is sucha central date in the satanic calendar that it is publicly celebrated in manyand various ways that are hidden behind cover stories. One of these was the MayDay parade in the Soviet Union, when vast crowds turned out to watch a displayof Soviet military might pass by while old men in dark clothes and each with aface like a smacked arse looked on. I understand that they were the Sovietleadership, but they always looked like funeral groupies to me. London and Romeare two such globally-significant bloodline centres, energetically andoperationally, that it was stretching the bounds of possibility way beyondsnapping point for the two rituals not to be intrinsically connected. This wasespecially so given the time that they were happening. Barack Obama also chosethe same May 1st 2011 to announce the breathtaking fable that Osama bin Ladenhad been killed and so making the bearded one the only person in known humanhistory to have died twice (see Remember Who You Are). The ritual in Rome wasthe ‘beatification’ of the departed John Paul II which was a totallymanufactured and contrived excuse to gather the best part of a million peopletogether from all over the world to focus their attention on another bloodlinebastion, the Roman Church and its then frontman, Nazi Youth member, PopeBenedict – he of the kind eyes and loving demeanour (Fig 435). John Paul IIbecame Pope after they murdered John Paul I and Joseph Ratzinger, later PopeBenedict, was Pope John Paul II’s minder and handler before getting theforeman’s job. The beatification was laughably justified by a French nunclaiming that she had been cured of a brain disorder after praying to Pope JohnPaul II following his death in 2005. Evidence that Pope John Paul had anythingto do with it? Nil. But ‘Vatican medical experts and theologians’, along withPope Benedict, decided the claim was genuine and a beatification was called for(look lads, we need a Beltane ritual in 2011, so find us an excuse). Vaticanpolicy demands an unexplained healing or other miracle by someone after theirdeath if they are to be beatified and you need two miracles to be a ‘Saint’. Ifanyone could produce a miracle of astounding proportions, like me converting toCatholicism, then I would beatify him myself although it all sounds ratherpainful to me.[../Images/00447.jpg]Figure 435: Ratzinger – such lovely eyes.‘Hey, Ethel, I’ve been beatified!’‘Oh, no, dear – I’ll fetch a cloth.’Here was a double-whammy royal-religious mass satanic ritual with two of theprime facets of the Archontic web, bloodline and religion, combining to impactupon the vibrational/information state of the Earth energy field and providebreakfast, lunch and dinner for the hidden energy vampires (Fig 436). I was senta picture of the TV coverage of the royal wedding just as one shot was beingmixed into another by the director (Fig 437). On the left-hand side there aretwo ‘alien-type’ images. I am not saying that this is what they are, but itgives a feel for how the predators operate just beyond human sight and feed offhuman energy. Most of the rituals are utterly bizarre like the annual ‘Troopingthe Colour’ ceremony. This is to commemorate the Queen’s official birthday, asopposed to the day that she was born. I know, go figure. Anyway, Trooping theColour? How do you ‘Troop’ a colour? Well, from I can see it means that somebloke in a black and red uniform and wearing an enormous and very hairy hatholds a flag (the ‘colour’) for what seems like hours while other blokes inblack and red uniforms and also wearing enormous and very hairy hats march upand down while a band belts out a tune. Occasionally another chap bellowed veryloudly at the top of voice giving instructions that I couldn’t decipher. Maybehe was saying ‘Will you all shut the fuck up, I’m trying to concentrate’, Idon’t know. It must have been hard to think with the band and all. What Icouldn’t work out is how he could see and I guess the horse must have been thereto help him out (Fig 438). This was all observed in reverence by a carefullyselected crowd that included the prime minister way back in the gallery tosymbolise his place in the hierarchy while the centre stage was held by theQueen and Prince Philip doing a very passable impression of the smacked-arsefaces of the former Soviet leadership. I learned while watching the BBC’scompulsorily-sycophantic coverage that the Queen has her very own piper. Was itthe piper that Peter Piper picked? No, he was from the Pied Piper Division, nodoubt, so he can play for the people waving their flags outside BuckinghamPalace. ‘Queen’s Piper, Pied Division, reporting for duty Ma’am, that’s as injam, not palm, Your Majesty.’ The colour was finally ‘trooped’ and the Addamsfamily departed for the Buckingham Palace balcony to be feted yet again byanother multitude. The soldiers in the comical attire are not purely ceremonial,either. They were active soldiers on tours of duty in Afghanistan, a senseless(except for the Archons) war in which members of the oppressed and programmedpopulations of Britain and the United States have been killing, and beingkilled, in a meaningless battle with the oppressed and programmed population ofAfghanistan. They are sent to kill and be killed by the network that the Queenpersonifies and then they come home to march before ‘Her Majesty’ whileterrified that they will not stay exactly in sync with their mates as they allpay their synchronised homage (Fig 439). And a few people can’t control theworld? I have barely touched the surface of how deep the rituals go and howconstant they are – seen and unseen – and this also relates to the obsessionwith ritual and ‘ceremonial re- enactments’ that are fundamental traits ofreptilian genetics, most notably the reptilian brain. The major symbols of thebloodlines are the flame or torch, all-seeing eye, obelisk, dove, serpent and somany more, and it is important to remember that whatever the public are toldthey mean has to be reversed and inverted to decode what they represent to theArchons and their bloodlines.[../Images/00394.jpg]Figure 436: The royal wedding/beatification Beltane ritual.[../Images/00277.jpg]Figure 437: The apparent ‘faces’ in the top left give a feel for how entitiesjust beyond human sight feed off human energy.[../Images/00268.jpg]Figure 438: ‘Help ... where am I?[../Images/00174.jpg]Figure 439: Toy soldiers serving the Queen.Nazi OlympicsThe flame of Prometheus, better known as the Olympic flame, was being taken by arelay of runners all over Britain while the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee rituals werealso in full swing. We were drowning in ritual in Britain in the summer of 2012.The Olympic flame was carried through the streets before cheering crowds in mostof the population centres of the United Kingdom on its way to the games inLondon. The Olympic torch relay by which the flame is carried from Greece to theOlympic venue every four years (two years including the Winter Olympics) hasnothing to do with the ancient games. It was instigated at the Nazi Olympics inBerlin in 1936 which were overseen by Hitler’s propaganda chief and occultist,Joseph Goebbels. The major Nazis were all occultists and Satanists andeverything they did was ritual in accordance with ancient satanic lore –Archontic lore. Goebbels had apparently persuaded Hitler to support the games asa means of promoting German pride and the Third Reich after ‘Mein Führer’ hadonce dismissed the Olympics as the work of ‘Jews and Freemasons’. The Nazis werefounded on a network of secret societies based on the same occult knowledge asthe Freemasons. They knew how secret societies covertly manipulate and so theysuppressed those that they didn’t control. Carl Diem, the Secretary General ofthe Organising Committee of the Berlin Olympic Games, is credited with launchingthe Olympic torch relay in 1936; but in a country so controlled by the Nazis,and with Nazism so founded on occult knowledge and rituals of ancient societieslike Greece, there is no way that the idea came entirely from him. The torch orflame was used as the symbol in Babylon for the (Saturn) sun god Nimrod and wehave this depicted most famously with the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbourwith the Babylonian goddess Semiramis/Ishtar holding the torch and flame ofNimrod. No flame had been used at all in the modern era of the Olympics untilthe Amsterdam games of 1928, but the flame was kindled in the Netherlands toburn at the stadium for the duration. The same happened in Los Angeles in 1932but in 1934, in the run up to the Berlin games, the International OlympicCommittee agreed to German requests that a flame should be kindled from the raysof the sun in Olympia, Greece, home of the original games, and carried by torchto the host city. The ‘Olympic’ tradition of the flame relay had begun and wascontinued on the streets of Britain in 2012. Some 3,330 runners carried theflame to Berlin through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria,Czechoslovakia and Germany in 1936, while 7,000 did so across Britain in 2012(Fig 440). On its way through Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia in 1936 protesterswere brutally dealt with in keeping with the ‘Olympic spirit’. The Nazis of 1936also made the Olympic (Saturn) rings popular and brought them into widespreaduse at Olympic Games to .this day. Carl Diem, or his Nazi bosses, ordered that amilestone with carved Olympic rings be installed at the ancient site of Delphibefore the torchbearers trotted off for Berlin. Later, two British writersvisited Delphi and found the said milestone with its Olympic rings andapparently recorded in their work History of the Ancient Games that the ringsymbol originated in ancient Greece when it was actually designed by theoriginator of the modern games and promoted to prominence by the Nazis. Theoriginal Olympic Games in Olympia are estimated to have begun in 776 BC and theycontinued for the next 1,170 years before they were banned by Emperor TheodosiusI, the last Roman emperor to rule over both the eastern and western sections ofthe Roman Empire. Theodosius was a Christian extremist who began the persecutionof paganism in 381 and this included a ban on pagan ritual even within privatehomes. The Olympic Games in Greece were believed to be a pagan ritual and sothey were subject to the same suppression. The fact that the ‘new’ Christianitywas the same pagan religion under another name clearly passed him by. It is saidthat a flame burned throughout the ancient games to commemorate the Greek god,our old friend Prometheus.[../Images/00313.jpg]Figure 440: The Nazis introduced the Olympic torch relay ritual.Frenzy of ritual and greedThe modern (Nazi-inspired) Olympic flame ritual begins when the flame is kindledin Greece by a ‘high priestess’ (a Greek stage actress) using a mirror to focusthe rays of the morning sun at Olympia in the ruins of the temple dedicated tothe goddess, Hera, queen of the Greek gods and the wife of the king, Zeus. The2012 flame was placed in an urn and taken (after going out once) to the ruins ofthe nearby stadium where the ancient games were staged before it was carried bytorch relay to Athens through towns and villages populated by desperate peopletrying to survive amid economic devastation coldly engineered by the samenetworks that ultimately control the Olympics, its rituals and where the gamesare staged. Greek parents have given their children away because they can nolonger feed them and, as a charity report declared at the time of torch relay,there were 13,000 homeless people in Athens alone sleeping in abandonedbuildings or on the street. A 60-year-old Greek musician and his 91-year-oldmother leaped to their deaths from their 5th floor apartment when financialpressures made them believe there was no point in going on. It was just one ofmany austerityrelated suicides in the country. There is so much sanctimoniouscrap spoken about the Olympics, often in hushed and reverent tones, when it isjust a media and moneymaking frenzy of bloodline greed and corruption.Individuals and small businesses in Britain were threatened with arrest forusing the Olympic symbol without paying to be an ‘official sponsor’ (handingover lots of loot). Webbers Property Services, a chain of estate agents in thewest of England, created window displays when the Olympic flame was passingwhich featured the Olympic rings (made from plastic gym hoops) and Olympictorches (made from old ‘For Sale’ signs). But in a matter of hours the companywas delivered a letter from the London organising committee, or LOCOG, demandingthat it remove the displays immediately or face possible legal action becauseonly official sponsors were allowed to display the Olympic rings or use thewords ‘London 2012’ and ‘Olympics’. The owner of the company said that they werejust trying to get into the ‘Olympic spirit’. Well, if you want to do that,mate, you’ll need an open chequebook with quite a few noughts on it. LOCOG evenconfirmed that it had a ‘designated person’ with the torch relay seeking out‘offenders’. The ‘Peoples’ Games’, eh? ‘Timeless Olympic values’? Taxpayers, viathe government, pumped nine billion into the games during a recession, but werethreatened for using the Olympic symbol or even the name. I can understand a banon using the term ‘official sponsor’, but displaying the Olympic rings or usingthe words ‘London 2012’ and ‘Olympics’?? Nonsense – and all to serve thebloodline corporate coin on which the Olympic establishment is focused.Organisers banned all other vendors from selling chips (fries in America)anywhere near the Olympic stadium because sponsor McDonald’s had insisted on amonopoly. You could only have chips elsewhere if they were accompanied by fish.I kid you not, and it caused outrage. I agree it was ridiculous, but if onlypeople and the media were as outraged about their children and grandchildrenheading for a global fascist dictatorship run by Satanists as they were over thefate of fried potatoes. The Olympic movement has become a very sick joke, amulti-billion pound frenzy of corporate exploitation of fit and healthy peopleto sell complete shite to the population and ensure that they will never be fitand healthy (Fig 441). Tom Chivers, assistant comment editor with the LondonTelegraph, wrote:[../Images/00129.jpg]Figure 341: The corporation Olympics.> Surely no one in the world really believes that the Olympic Games are a> spirit-of-pureamateurism, Corinthian-values offering to the gods of Sport any> more.

Lord Coe, formerlythe athlete Sebastian Coe, chairman of the same warning-letter-sending LOCOG,said the following in Olympia after the flame was kindled:> We are reminded this morning of sport’s enduring and universal appeal, and the> timeless Olympic values that transcend history and geography; values which, I> believe, in these challenging times are more relevant than at any time before> and particularly to young people the world over.

Does this guy never watch the news? I met Coe hereand there when I was a sports presenter with the BBC and I can tell that thisguy does ‘pompous’ on, appropriately, an Olympian scale. Coe made millions soonafter the Olympics when he sold his private management consultancy firm, theComplete Leisure Group Limited, to Chime Communications which was heavilyinvolved with sponsors at the Games. Chime was founded in the 1980s by LordBell, the close aide and PR spinner to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. LordCoe was a Conservative Member of Parliament and chief of staff to then partyleader William Hague who went on to become Foreign Secretary to Prime MinisterDavid Cameron. Hague was a shareholder in Coe’s company when it was sold toChime and so enjoyed a nice post-Olympics windfall, too. Well, that’s the‘Olympic legacy’ sorted out then.[../Images/00476.jpg]Figure 442: An actress ‘goddess’ in Athens.[../Images/00321.jpg]Figure 443: The princess and the miner’s lamp: ‘What does one do with this?’Miner’s lamp goes business classCoe was in Athens for the handover of the flame from Greece to London. I watchedthe coverage live on the BBC just to see how the ritual unfolded. The word‘bizarre’ came immediately to mind. The high priestess and her priestesses wereback to prance around again and the flame was treated with god-like reverence.The high priestess (stage actress) lit the London flame from the Greek cauldronand it was officially received by the Queen’s daughter, the Princess Royal,formerly Princess Anne, who walked out of the stadium holding what looked like aminer’s lamp and the flame that Lord Coe insisted in his speech ‘belongs to theworld’ (Figs 442 and 443). It’s a bloody flame; in a miner’s lamp. The House ofWindsor’s Princess Royal, from a family for whom flames and torches haveespecial meaning, strolled off with her miner’s lamp and the ‘flame that belongsto the world’ and headed for the airport and England’s green and pleasant land.From this point some of the language with regard to the flame described it inalmost human terms and certainly as god-like. It was flown from Greece toEngland in a specially-painted British Airways jet, named Firefly (nice touch),in business class seats 1A and 1B. It is unknown what it had for dinner althoughwhatever it was would surely have been well- done; but we are told that theflame travelled in four lanterns (miner’s lamps) ‘secured to the chair by aseatbelt and a Velcro strap’. Alongside them in seat 1C was a ‘MetropolitanPolice officer trained in fire-fighting’ to ‘keep an eye’ on the flames for the‘entire 1,500-mile flight’. Make that two eyes, darling, will you? We’re at35,000 feet (Fig 444). The flame landed safety at the Royal Navy airbase atCuldrose in Cornwall where still more pompous over-the-top nonsense was spokenbefore it began its tour of the country courtesy of some 7,000 hands holding7,000 different torches which those involved were allowed to keep. The officialschedule described each daily route and then ended with ‘overnight stop in soand so’. Where did the flame and its offspring in the miner’s lamps stayovernight, I wondered? Did they get it a nice hotel with en-suite room? I can’tsee that a bath and a shower would be required, but then the flame goes out manytimes, anyway, as it did immediately after being kindled at Olympia. They saythat it was re-ignited with ‘backup flames’, but I bet some have been re-litafter the words ‘Hey, Harry/Hans/Hernandez – you got a match?’ The flame, infact, spent every night in a cauldron leading to the big cauldron in the OlympicStadium where it burned for the duration of the games. The symbol of thecauldron can be found in many ancient and occult rituals and beliefs, often withthe symbolism of the womb (goddess). They are used in human sacrifice tosymbolise the goddess of death and rebirth and in Greek mythology the witchMedea ‘restored people to youth in a magic cauldron’. An estimated 10,000 peopleturned out to see Zara Phillips, the House of Windsor daughter of the Princess‘miner’s lamp’ Royal, arrive on horseback at Cheltenham racecourse in the westof England holding the Olympic torch with which she lit the cauldron for anovernight stop (Fig 445). The Olympic flame and cauldron are connected to theGreek goddess Hera and it is in the ruins of the temple in Olympia dedicated to‘her’ that the flame is kindled. It’s all ritual associated with the longhistory of bloodline worship of the gods and goddesses – their hidden Archonticmasters. The flame route included the film set of the BBC soap opera,Eastenders, when fictional characters ran through the set with the flame as apart of a special episode just before the opening of the games. Given the mythsand fictions surrounding the Olympics, this could not be more apt. Fantasypromotes fantasy. The cauldron bedtime deal happened every evening and duringthe day unwitting people, both carrying the torch and watching it pass, wereadding their energy to what it really represents. There would have been lovely,genuine people doing this and there are many who ran with the torch that hadwonderful tales to tell of how they overcame adversity. That’s great and I amnot criticising them, only pointing out that they were caught in a mass occultritual that they didn’t understand while it masqueraded as the people’s gamesand the ‘Olympic spirit’. The flame is, like everything, an energy field, butnot the same as any old flame that you see in any old fire. The ritualismsurrounding the flame connects it vibrationally to the Demiurge-Archon frequencyband and the focus of attention of the masses makes a connection through theflame to that force ‘made from luminous fire’ (Fig 446). This means that theelectromagnetic fields of the attentive crowds were being trawled the whole timeand if the flame could have been seen on an energetic level by the time itarrived at the Olympic Stadium it would have been a fantastic electromagneticfield fuelled by the collective energy of the people.[../Images/00303.jpg]Figure 444: Seat of the fire.[../Images/00339.jpg]Figure 445: Zara Phillips with flame and the cheering thousands.[../Images/00308.jpg]Figure 446: If you could have seen the flame beyond the hologram it would havebeen an energetic field attracting the energy of public focus and attention.[../Images/00307.jpg]Figure 447: The illuminated pyramids at the Olympic Stadium.The Olympic mass ritualI know many people will find this hard or even impossible to believe, but theyare thinking ‘physical’ and that is only a holographic projection. It is inwaveform and electromagnetic realms beyond human sight that the rituals are allhappening. The flame – the by now colossal electromagnetic field with frequencyconnections to all that collective attention – ended its journey at the LondonOlympic Stadium built by the construction company of the El-lite ScottishMcAlpine family (see Thatcher’s mate Lord McAlpine) on land polluted byradioactive waste. Shining down were the stadium floodlights designed aspyramids with illuminated capstones (Fig 447). Looking on were the officialOlympic mascots depicting the single or all-seeing eye and the games logo wasalso blatant symbolism with ‘2012’ clearly representing the word ‘Zion’ – Saturn(Figs 448 and 449). The date of the opening ceremony (ritual) was July 27th – avery significant day in the satanic calendar. The days between July 20th and26th are for ‘abduction, ceremonial preparation and holding a sacrificial victimfor the ‘Grand Climax’ on ... July 27th. This is the day that satanic loredemands the sacrificing of female children and adults. If there were notchildren and adults being sacrificed within the stadium, probably rightunderneath the Olympic cauldron as it was lit then I would be staggered. Theattention of the 80,000 people in the stadium and the estimated billion-strongworldwide television audience was focussed on the flame even more because it wasnot ignited in the usual way. Instead of one person lighting one flame, sevenyoung British athletes each lit a flame on the ground which went on to light 205individual ‘petals’ which then came together technologically to form the Olympicflame. It was encircled by athletes from the competing nations with a billionpeople focussed on the flame as it came together. The effect of this on theglobal electromagnetic field would have been highly significant especially inLondon and the UK (Fig 450). You can see what happened when censors picked upthe dramatic spike in the field at the time that global attention and emotionalreaction was focused on the events of 9/11(Fig 450). The opening and closingceremonies were full of occult and Archontic themes. We had the theme of ‘greenand pleasant land’ from the poem/hymn ‘Jerusalem’ by William Blake which I willreturn to later, and a central feature throughout was a mock-up of GlastonburyTor, one of Britain’s biggest earth-energy power centres. The opening ceremonydepicted the land being devastated by the Britain-inspired Industrial Revolutionfuelled by Rothschild-type figures amid a dirty and bleak setting thatencapsulated the machine-like mind and ugliness (distortion) of everything theArchons touch and change (Fig 451). This part of the ceremony was called‘Pandemonium’ – from John Milton’s Paradise Lost. As I said earlier,Pan-demon-ium (‘All-demon-place’) was Milton’s ‘high capital of Satan and allhis peers’. The ceremony opened with the sound of a gigantic bell (Baal)weighing 23 tonnes (twice the size of Big Ben) and made especially for theOlympics. It was the largest harmonically-tuned bell in the world. All this forjust one ‘clang’, but money was no problem with a budget for the openingceremony of £27 million. The bell was inscribed with the words ‘Be not afraid;the isle is full of noises’, a quote from The Tempest, the play wronglyattributed to William Shakespeare, but that is another story. These words arespoken by the character of Caliban who is described as a hideous, monstrousbeing; part fish, part beast and part man and the offspring of the Devil and hismother, the witch Sycorax. The opening ceremony was certainly full of noiseswith a million watt sound system and 500 speakers as music pounded out under theorchestration of the appropriately-named techno group, Underworld, the musicdirectors of the games. The mammoth sound (vibration/frequency) and theconstantly flashing lights, fireworks and fast-changing scenes would havebombarded the senses of the conscious mind into overload – and this is when thesubconscious can be accessed while conscious attention is unable to processeverything that it is seeing and hearing. The watching public have no idea ofwhat is happening before their eyes and within their subconscious as these massrituals and the symbols infiltrate the psyche of the unsuspecting.[../Images/00171.jpg]Figure 448: The all-seeing eye Olympic mascots with the pyramids in thebackground.[../Images/00258.jpg]Figure 449: The London 2012 logo was clearly meant to say Zion.> [../Images/00237.jpg]> Figure 450: The global focus of attention on the Olympic flame in London and> the dramatic spike in the Earth energy field from the public response to the> 9/11 attacks.[../Images/00347.jpg]Figure 451: Archon world in the Olympic opening ceremony.Demons and childrenNearly a thousand pre-pubescent children took part and we had many of them inpyjamas in lines of hospital beds cowering beneath a giant demon that hoveredover them (Fig 452). Then there was what looked clearly like the portrayal ofsperm connecting with the flying Olympic (Saturn) rings and followed by thebirth of a very sinister-looking giant baby (Figs 453 and 454). The bizarrechildren-demon sequence was introduced by J R Rowling, writer of the occultHarry Potter children’s books, who read a passage from Peter Pan (the goathumanPan, the Saturn god). J M Barrie’s original Peter Pan was a bloodthirsty andcruel kidnapper and killer of children and the sequence continued with theappearance of the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Fig 455). What wasall this doing in the opening ceremony to a sporting event? Princess Diana grewup on the Windsor’s estate at Sandringham in Norfolk and said she was invited togo over to the main palace during school holidays and watch a film with theroyal children. She said that year after year it was Chitty Chitty Bang Bang –the story of a Jimmy Savile-type child-snatcher who lures his victims withlollipops and takes them to a prison on the orders from the evil rulers ofVulgaria, Baron and Baroness Bomburst. Princess Diana once said:[../Images/00461.jpg]Figure 452: Lines of children in beds and the giant demonic figures.[../Images/00269.jpg]Figure 453: The sperm-like image under the rings of fire.[../Images/00004.jpg]Figure 454: The strange giant baby.[../Images/00352.jpg]Figure 455: The Chitty Chitty children catcher..[../Images/00238.jpg]Figure 456: Annie Lennox on the ship of Satan.> We were all shunted over to Sandringham for holidays.

Holidays were always very grim because we had a four-week holiday.The atmosphere was strange in the midst of a satanic family in a satanic palace.I can’t think why. The whole Olympic opening ceremony was deluged with satanic,Saturnic and other occult themes, symbolism and numerology and it was much thesame with the closing ceremony. We had people building a pyramid which theparticipants then lay down to worship and a very dark sequence with singer AnnieLennox on a boat with the figure meant to portray Satan waving his wings behindher while the whole scene was bathed in red light (Fig 456). This is more Saturnsymbolism. The pre-cataclysmic Saturn and its luminous crescent were symbolisedas the Saturn God sailing or flying on his heavenly boat (Figs 457 and 458). TheEgyptians portrayed their god Horus on his crescent boat and the same symbolismcan be seen on a Freemason’s lodge at Newport on the Isle of Wight (Fig 459).The ‘star’ of the closing ceremony was not surprisingly the phoenix whichdominated the final sequence (Fig 460). It was like watching The Olympic Guideto Archontic Symbolism. Once I heard that London was bidding for the 2012 gamesit was obvious that they were going to win. London, a prime energy andoperational centre for the global conspiracy, and the mythical (and it wasmythical) year of 2012, had a relationship so symbiotic that they had to gotogether. London did, of course, win the bid because the games go wherever theArchon bloodlines decide they want to locate their next global ritual to bewatched by billions and vampire energy while sending subliminal programming theother way. Sport itself is orchestrated by the Archon networks as a hijacker anddiverter of public attention – football/soccer is the biggest example worldwidealong with the Olympics and the Super Bowl in the United States. I like sport,up to a point, but when you become totally consumed by it to the exclusion ofalmost everything else – they gotcha. The Olympic ceremonies were overseen by apo-faced Queen who would have known exactly what it all meant after a lifetimeof being schooled in the occult arts. All the events where people gather tofocus their attention on people and symbols of the Archontic conspiracy are massrituals to vampire energy and encode thought patterns and perceptions. This isthe case with royal pomp and ceremony, religious gatherings of all kinds,political rallies, sporting events and music concerts. Not necessarily all sportand music events, but those where there is hostility among the crowd andlow-vibrational music and symbolism on the stage. That means most of them thesedays. You could not think of an apparently more contrasting scene and sense ofreality than Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca at the Hajj and Madonna beltingout a number at the Super Bowl, but the effect is the same because they are massArchontic rituals (Figs 461 and 462). The participants don’t know, but theorchestrators certainly do. The Olympic ‘ideal’ is in the same league ofbullshit as governments working in the interests of the people and religionspreaching love, compassion and peace. UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon appearedby video at the opening ceremony in London to say: ‘I call on warring partieseverywhere to lay down their weapons during the Games.’ What about afterwards,mate? It was just another line from the bullshit factory. As he spoke, Britainand especially London had been turned into a military-police state with 13,500military personnel, 12,500 police officers (Britain’s biggest pre-planned policeoperation in history) and 23,500 private ‘security guards’ (increased from theestimated 10,000). These were joined by a thousand armed US FBI and ‘diplomatic’agents. HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy’s biggest ship, was berthed on the RiverThames for the duration as the base for Lynx helicopters and Royal Marinesnipers; there were surface-to-air missile launchers deployed on London domesticrooftops and an 11-mile, 5,000-volt capacity electric security fence dividingthe main Olympic area from the rest of the capital. The games were used to fundand justify a vast expansion of ‘scanners, biometric ID cards, number-plate andfacial-recognition CCTV systems, disease tracking systems, new police controlcentres and checkpoints’. New laws were passed to make legal the use of force(including by private security companies) to remove protestors and any displayof perceived commercial use of Olympic names and logos by unlicensed people. Thefact that the British government has a policy of replacing much of thetraditional police force with private security firms is just a coincidence, ofcourse.[../Images/00063.jpg]Figure 457: Saturn as a heavenly boat.[../Images/00298.jpg]Figure 458: The Egyptian god Horus sailing his heavenly boat.[../Images/00435.jpg]Figure 459: The ship symbol on the outside of a Freemason lodge in Newport, Isleof Wight.[../Images/00156.jpg]Figure 460: The rising phoenix dominated the end of the Olympic closing ceremonyin London.[../Images/00381.jpg]Figure 461: Energy trawling at Mecca...[../Images/00350.jpg]Figure 462: ... and at symbol-dominated music eventsA simple rule of thumb or any other digit: if the El-lite are promotingsomething, whatever it may be, it is not good for the target population.

Ancientinitiates employed these and other sequences in their great buildings andtemples. They knew that these digital and geometrical states reflect energeticwaveform patterns and if you can design the proportions of a building inmathematical and geometrical harmony then the energetic expression of thatharmony (expanded awareness) will fill your building or temple. Waveform statesare numbers and numbers are waveform states.The Matrix has been designed to cause a schism in that harmony by distortingdigital, waveform and holographic states because the Demiurge-Archons arethemselves a distortion and cannot exist within energetic harmony. They don’thave creative imagination because of their distortion and to have power overhumans they must make us even more distorted than they are – in the land of theblind the one-eyed man is king. The Matrix and its vibrational/digitaldistortion are being constantly expanded, underpinned and supported by overt(for those who have eyes to see) and covert means. I was approached by a mancalled Steve Clarke from the north of England who has long experience in themusic industry which has naturally given him an appreciation of the effects ofvibration. He told me that over the years he has identified recurring digitalcodes (a digital expression of a waveform state) throughout human society. Manyothers have done the same since ancient times. The art of numerology is based onreading the digital level of reality. Many of the recurring numbers that SteveClarke has identified relate to the phenomenon called harmonics (also known asovertones). To put this is in the simplest terms, harmonic frequencies are anexpression of the prime frequency in any situation. When someone plucks a guitaror violin string to, say, note A (440 Hertz, or 440 vibrations per second) thisis the prime or fundamental frequency; but at the same time this triggers otherfrequencies in a recurring and predictable sequence that together produce themusic that we hear. The prime frequency, in this case 440 Hertz, is known as thefirst harmonic; but the effect of this frequency generates others at 800 Hz (thesecond harmonic); 1320 Hz (third harmonic); and 1760 Hz (fourth harmonic). TheMatrix and its Archon manipulators dictate human perception in the same way bycontrolling the prime or dominant frequencies and by definition the harmonicfrequencies that follow from them. The recurring numbers or digital sequencesidentified by today’s researchers and others throughout history reflect bothprime frequencies and their harmonics, and the themes make total sense from theperspective of my work over the years of identifying and exposing the Matrix.The Archons literally set the ‘tone’ or tones and they have used geneticengineering and other energetic techniques to synchronise the human Body-Mindwith those tones or frequencies. I contend that the Matrix is a construct basedon standing waves. These are created when identical waves ‘collide’ and canceleach other out in terms of forward movement. The effect is that the wavesresonate without directional impetus like someone running on the spot. If youshake your hand while not moving your arm in any direction you are symbolising astanding wave. Now what I am about to say is absolutely cutting edge. It opensthe door to understanding how the Matrix works at the deepest level and how itscontrol can be broken. This insight hit me like a train as I was writing thischapter and it relates to what a standing wave looks like (Figs 463). The wavestake the form of peaks and troughs as one wave cancels out the other to create asingle resonating wave ‘running on the spot’. The height of the peaks depends onthe frequency of the wave. Now what does this remind you of? Yes ... DNA (Fig464). I have been emphasising over and over in this book and for so many yearsthat there is no ‘physical’ and this totality must include DNA. It only appearsto have physicality because of the way we decode waveform information intoholographic reality. DNA is a waveform phenomenon and every other state is onlya decoded version of the waveform fields. DNA is in effect a sound wave and canbe changed by sound waves that entrain its frequency with their own.‘Entrainment’ is a term that describes how the most dominant frequency willbring others into line. If you have three violins playing the same note(dominant frequency) then the strings of another violin placed nearby will beginto vibrate to the same frequency. There is harmonious entrainment when the primefrequencies of the true universe entrain everything into collective harmony andthere is destructive entrainment when disharmonious frequencies entrain otherfrequencies (like the Earth and human energy fields) into a state of distortionand imbalance. The latter is what the Archon Matrix is doing to distortindividual and collective perceptions of reality. Most humans are held fast bythe dominant frequency (the Matrix) but when enough people open their minds toConsciousness humanity can easily become the dominant frequency and the Matrixis no more. The Archons bloodlines have a differently-coded DNA which allowsthem to decode what humans normally can’t and this is done for added advantage.When the Archon Satanist and former British Prime Minister Ted Heath was‘scanning’ my energy field in 1989 he was seeing levels of me that most otherscan’t see which explains the very inquisitive look on his face that said ‘Whatdo we have here?’[../Images/00203.jpg]Figure 463: A standing wave created by vibration.[../Images/00317.jpg]Figure 464: A standing wave and DNA.[../Images/00165.jpg]Figure 465: Humanity has been tuned to the Matrix and if your attention isfocussed only on the five senses this will be your only conscious reality.[../Images/00108.jpg]Figure 466: The lie/closed mind standing wave.It is said that we can’t see the Matrix, but we can. Look at DNA and there it isbecause the Matrix has entrained human DNA with the Matrix (the soundinformation broadcast from Saturn, the moon and wherever else). This has changedthe original RNA/DNA frequency state and synchronised it with the frequency bandof the Matrix. There is no need for ‘aliens’ to have sex with human women tochange the human form and the source to which it is tuned. It can potentially bedone that way, though not very quickly, but it doesn’t have to be if you knowwhat you are doing. You send out an initial broadcast frequency that syncs withRNA/DNA and the two begin to resonate in harmony. Then you begin to change yourbroadcast frequency and if it is the dominant or prime one you take thefrequency of DNA with you. If you can change RNA then it will transfer the newprogram to DNA and when this happens DNA ceases to be synchronised with theformer reality and starts to decode a new reality – the fake reality of theMatrix (Fig 465). In this way the old world became the new and this is how theHack was achieved. The effect of the frequency change also closed down manyother strands of DNA (sound or frequency systems) leaving us with only the twothat allow us only to perceive the tiny frequency band of the Matrix or, infact, a tiny frequency band even within the Matrix – what we call visible light.This causes people in Body-Mind to be dominated by the five senses (realm of theMatrix). Many of those frequency strands of DNA blocked by Matrix entrainmentconnected humans with the greater reality and so the only way out of the Matrixfrequency prison is opening Body-Mind to Consciousness that is beyond theMatrix. When we move our point of attention from purely five sense reality(Matrix) into Consciousness (beyond the Matrix) we can suddenly see what ishappening. We are, in terms of our point of observation and source of insight,outside looking in. Put another way we are in this world but not of it. You mayrecall, too, that I talked earlier about how closed minds create a standing wavebetween the lies that we are given as truth and the inability to open the mindto possibility beyond the lie. These are also Matrix standing waves (Fig 466).The frequency wall of the standing wave Matrix is what scientists call the speedof light. The Consciousness that I am talking about operates outside the speedof light while Body-Mind is within the speed of light. The Archons could not andcannot change everything about the human form and its receiver-transmittersystems because there are other forces at work such as the ‘natural’ vibrationalblueprint pulling the other way like a rubber band trying to bounce back. Theywere also limited by the fact that much of original had to be left in situ orthe body-computer could not interact with the Matrix, which is only a bad copyof the original reality. But what they can do, and have done, is significantlydistort what should be and they constantly try to expand and protect thisdistortion in a myriad of ways, with music right up there with any of them.Going where the music takes me?If you put the words ‘Ruben’s Tube’ into a YouTube search you will see a shortvideo showing the effect on standing waves of different frequencies includingmusic. The effect on human reality of sound and its expression called musiccannot be overstated and the Archon bloodlines and secret societies work so hardto control and manipulate the music industry. Are you an artist playing musicthat will distort and so enslave the human energy field? Well, you are likely tobecome a big star then with the major music corporations and media giving youevery support (see Madonna, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, the list would fill a library).Are you making music that harmonises, expands and awakens the human energyfield? Well, you’re on your own and the corporations will do everything they canto block you. Be very careful what you listen to (Fig 467). It is highlysignificant that the standard music frequency or ‘concert pitch’ (vibration) hasbeen officially (bloodline) set at 440 Hertz for note A which then plays outwith corresponding change to all the other notes. This was adopted by theAmerican Federation of Musicians in 1917 and became the US standard in1920. TheNazi regime in Germany imposed the A = 440Hz frequency in 1939 and Nazipropaganda minister Joseph Goebbels sought to make this a globalstandardisation. He didn’t manage to do that, but others in the Archon bloodlinecabal did so and in 1955 the International Organization for Standardization made440 the world standard. The manipulating force in the background was the Archonand Rothschild Zionist Rockefellers via the Rockefeller Foundation, one of their‘taxexempt foundations’ that allow them to fund the conspiracy without payingtax. They are promoted as vehicles of ‘philanthropy’ when they are funding theArchon agenda. The police state is now employing excruciatingly painful soundtechnology to scatter peaceful protests and the manipulation of music is foundedon the same principle. Sound (vibration) which is in sync with the human energyfield can be beneficial for body, mind and emotional harmony; and sound(vibration) that is out of sync can generate body, mind and emotional disharmony– distortion – and the more out of sync it is the greater the damage, as we seewith the sound frequencies used on protestors. What better way to constantlyunderpin this energetic distortion of the Matrix-DNA connection than to encodeit into the very frequencies used by the global music industry in all itsmultiple forms? People are hearing music all the time, on the radio, television,and through all the various personal technologies of today. Music is everywhereand music is made by vibration. The principle of distortion through music is sosimple – and remember what heavy metal music does to water crystals as revealedby the image earlier in the book. Some researchers say that the frequency of 8Hzharmonises the two hemispheres of the brain into a whole-brain state and, bydefinition, there will other frequencies that stop the two hemispheres fromexperiencing a whole-brain connection. These are the frequencies bombarding usall the time and when you realise that research into the effects of music andother sound vibration on human health, mind and emotions has been funded by theArchon Rockefeller family and the Archon US military it makes perfect sense ofit all.[../Images/00044.jpg]Figure 465: Music can awaken or slam the vibrational door.As it was ...Before the standardisation of concert pitch at 440Hz, the frequency was largely432 Hz, although people chose a variety of pitch frequencies and also tunedinstruments to the frequencies of the voices involved in a performance. Theoriginal Stradivarius violin was designed to be tuned to 432 which is a multipleof 54 cycles of 8 (8Hz is said to harmonise both sides of the brain as Imentioned). The universe beyond the Matrix would appear be founded on a seriesof frequencies and harmonics that include 72, 144 and 432 which is interestingbecause 72 is 9 x 8 and 144 is 18 x 8, as 432 is 54 x 8. The square root(multiples of a number within another number) of the official speed of light(the edge of the Matrix where it meets the real universe) is 432. The diameterof the Sun is 864,000 miles and 864 = 2 x 432. The diameter of the Moon is 2160miles and 2160 = 5 x 432. The mathematics of the Sun and Moon always seem to beinvolved somewhere. You can see something in everything if you set out to makeit fit, but numbers like 8, 72, 144, 432 and others recur far too often for themnot to be significant to the digital level of the universal construct and theMatrix Hack. It is stretching the bounds of coincidence to believe that changingthe pitch frequency from 432Hz (and all the other frequencies or ‘notes’ whichcome from that) was not carefully planned, especially with the documentedinvolvement of the infamous Rothschild subordinates, the Rockefellers. It mightbe noted that 440 is 55 x 8, but 440 is not an (ever- recurring) ‘sacred number’that breaks out through harmonics into other ‘sacred’ numbers like 144. But 432is and does, and its harmonic numbers relate to ‘sacred’ (harmonising) geometry.The new standard frequency of 440Hz may not seem far from 432, but it is enoughto distort the natural order. It makes sense, too, of what a Japanese musicexpert told me on a visit to the country some years ago when she said thatmodern recordings of great composers like Mozart don’t sound the same becausethey are no longer produced in the original frequency for which they werewritten. This is another example of deleting everything that could have anawakening effect. The Schiller Institute, headquartered in Washington DC, hasbeen campaigning for a return to the 432 musical pitch and they published anarticle on their website by Jonathan Tennenbaum of the Fusion Energy Foundationin Germany which first appeared in Fidelio magazine. He writes:> The recent rediscoveries of the vibratory/oscillatory nature of the universe> indicates that current contemporary A=440Hz international concert pitch> standard may possibly generate an unhealthy effect or anti-social behavior in> the consciousness of human beings.

The vibration of music can harmonise or distort thefunction of DNA receiver-transmission. Dr Andrija Puharich, an American medicaland parapsychological researcher, discovered around the time that I was born inthe 1950s how frequencies affect behaviour and perception. He used frequenciesto change behaviour by changing DNA and its ‘encoder/decoder’ RNA.Interestingly, he realised in his research that psychic people operate on 8Hzwhen they are connecting with other realities – this is what happens when webecome whole-brained. This is what genuine psychics are at the time they areopen to ‘beyond’, and being inter-dimensional awareness is supposed to be ournatural state, but that is the last thing the Archons want us to be because wewould see the game for what it is. Dr Puharich found that frequencies of 10.80Hzproduce ‘riotous behaviour’ and 6.6Hz makes people depressed. The Archon ControlSystem broadcasts inaudible communications across an area on the riotousbehaviour frequency when they want to start or escalate a riot which allows themto justify more extreme policing and surveillance. There is also a frequencythat they use to create mass hysteria among those who entrain with it. This isdone when they want a mass response of fear and outrage that leads to supportfor a war or some other Archon imposition. Those who expanded their point ofattention in some form of Consciousness will not be affected to the same extent,or even at all if they expanded enough because they won’t entrain with thefrequency. Humanity is being manipulated in ways that most people couldn’t evenconceive while their sense of reality is hijacked by TV game shows and whateverbollocks that Simon Cowell is currently peddling for mega-bucks asentertainment. In fact, they are being programmed while they are watching thiscrap and everything else on the television networks of the world. Watchingtelevision while unaware of what it is doing puts you in the same brain-wavestate as a hypnotic trance. This allows subliminal (‘below-threshold’) messagesto be broadcast to the subconscious mind that later filter through to theconscious mind as apparently the person’s own thoughts, perceptions andemotional responses. This is not done by the programme makers who largely haveno idea that this is going on. The subliminal communications are encoded duringthe process of delivering the programmes (mind-programmes) into peoples’ homes.Emerging digital television makes this even more effective because it deliversinformation closer to holographic form. I have had my eye on the digitalchangeover for some time because of the speed with which this has been rushedthrough and imposed – even making the public buy new car radios eventually asall broadcasting moves to digital. The whole thing was, to me, a rat withoutdeodorant. This made me particularly interested when numbers researcher SteveClarke told me that recurring frequencies and their harmonics which he hadidentified could be found encoded in digital television technology. Televisionand radio have been accessing Body-Mind via at the waveform level up to thispoint, but now they are opening the door at the digital level which is only onestage from the holographic realm and the ‘done-deal’ of what we perceive as‘physical’ reality. This means less potential for filtering out the messagesbefore they become perceptions and behaviour and it also frees the formeranalogue frequencies for other technologies including the planned humanmicrochips.The ‘music’ of buildings and symbolsIt is not only the obvious expressions of vibration like music and broadcastingthat are used to underpin the Matrix and distort and suppress human awareness.Ancient initiates of the Mystery Schools before their infiltration used buildinggeometry and symbols to resonate harmonious frequencies, but the reverse is alsothe case. The knowledge is not good or bad, but the application of it can be. Ihave been aware of the principle of using buildings and street plans to producecollective energetic (information) patterns in cities and whole countries formany years going back to the 1990s. I have exposed this in my books since TheBiggest Secret, first published in 1998. I have highlighted the street plan ofWashington DC which has a maze of esoteric symbols encoded in roads systems,statues and buildings. All holographic form is an expression of waveformenergetic states and if you get the geometry right then you will generate theenergy which that geometry holographically represents. Foster Bailey (1888-1977)was a Freemason, National Secretary of Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society,and co-founder of the Lucis [Lucifer] Trust which promoted the works his wife,the occultist Alice Bailey. He said: ‘A symbol veils or hides a secret, and itis that which veils mysterious forces. These energies when released can have apotent effect.’ Satanism and the Archon secret society network invert symbols tomake that potent effect as distorting as possible. There are distorted andinverted satanic pentagrams in the street plan of Washington, one with itsinverted point fixed on the White House and the other on Capitol Hill (Figs 468and 469). Albert Pike, one of the pre-eminent American Freemasons of the 19thcentury, and a founder of the Ku Klux Klan, wrote in his book, Morals and Dogma,that the pentagram ‘has been regarded as an emblem of Omniscience, or All-SeeingEye, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the emblem of Osiris, the Creator[Saturn]’. The official focus of government in the United States is Capitol Hillbut this is not a political building at all; that is only the cover story. It isa satanic (Saturnic) temple and that’s why so many satanic decisions are madethere and why the souls of the overwhelming majority of those who work therehave been sold to the agenda of the Demiurge and the Archons. ‘Capitol Hill’means ‘Hill of the Skull’ and was named after Capitoline Hill, one of the sevenhills of bloodline-established Rome (Fig 470). Washington was designed with Romein mind for this reason and hence the architecture. The same applies to othergreat bloodline cities such as London, ‘The City’ and Paris. The official storyis that Capitoline Hill in Rome was so named because a human skull wasdiscovered as they were digging the foundations for the Temple of Jupiter. Skullin Latin is ‘caput’ and so still today we say that something is caput if it isdead or won’t work. The skull is a major symbol of the Archon bloodlines becauseit stands for death, just as they do. They feed off the energy of death and forthem it is always a case of the more the better. Capitol Hill and others of thesame name in state capitals around America are temples to the Cult of Death. Theword capital with an ‘a’, comes from the same source. The planet/sun associatedwith death is Saturn which is symbolised by a human skull because astrologicallyit represents the head and skeletal structure. The previous name of CapitolineHill in Rome was ... Mons Saturnius – the Hill of Saturn. Mons in Latin meanshill, mound or mountain. The Temple of Saturn was placed by the Romans at thefoot of Mons Saturnius on the road that leads to the top (Fig 471). CapitolineHill therefore becomes a code for Saturn Hill, and the centre of government andcontrol in every country is called a capital or capitol – after Saturn, theplanet (sun) of authority and control. Government and parliament buildings likeCapitol Hill (Hill of Saturn) and the Houses of Parliament are satanic templesdedicated to Saturn. The powers behind the conspiracy know full well thesignificance of the Hill of Saturn, or Capitoline Hill. The Treaty of Rome whichestablished what became the Archon-created European Union was signed at thePalazzo dei Conservatori on Capitoline Hill and Saturn worshipper Tony Blairsigned one of the later EU sovereigntydeletion documents in the same place underthe statue of Pope Innocent X. The Pope is portrayed in the beehive hat thatsymbolises the Merovingian bloodline which is one of the most prominent in theArchon bloodline network (Fig 472). Pope Innocent X (1574–1655) didn’t live upto his name, really. He ordered the destruction of the city of Castro and triedto block a peace settlement to end the Thirty Years’ War in Europe in which tensof millions died. Continuing the war no matter what the cost served the Pope’sand Vatican’s interests. He must have done it Innocently, I guess, but mygoodness, Tony Blair will have felt so at home there. One of the most exclusivesecret societies in the Archon web in the United States is called the Skull andBones Society or the Order of Death (Saturn). The skull has been a themethroughout the period of the Archon hijack. I have seen them widely portrayed atcentres of Archon worship at Mayan sites such as Chichén Itza in the Yucatan,Mexico, and the story of Jesus being crucified at Golgotha or Calvary is thesame symbolism used by one of the major Archon religions. Both names indifferent languages mean Place of the Skull. There is also a Saturnicsix-pointed star, or Star of David, in the street plan of Washington which onceagain connects into Capi-skull Hill, the Hill of Saturn (Fig 473). All thesestreet plans, buildings and symbols are generating the energy of Saturn andentraining those enclosed in five-sense awareness into the perception-web ofSaturn.[../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 468: An inverted and distorted pentagram with the White House at thebottom.[../Images/00116.jpg]Figure 469: An inverted and distorted pentagram with Capitol Hill at the bottom.[../Images/00372.jpg]Figure 470: Capitoline Hill or Mons Saturnius.[../Images/00037.jpg]Figure 471: The ruins of the Temple of Saturn.[../Images/00456.jpg]Figure 472: Tony Blair feeling at home on Capitoline Hill.[../Images/00221.jpg]Figure 473: The Saturn and Rothschild symbol with Capitol Hill at the bottom.The Greeks knewThe most famous ‘numbers man’ in history is the ancient Greek mathematician andphilosopher, Pythagoras, after whom the Pythagorean Theorem, which states thata2 + b2 = c2, is named. There, that’s changed your life, eh? Put another way,the longest side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum total of theother two. I vaguely remember when I was daydreaming at school half-hearingsomething about the square of the hypotenuse being equal to the sum of thesquares of the other two sides. It is that strange word ‘hypotenuse’ thattriggers the memory. ‘Icke, stop daydreaming! What is a hypotenuse?’ Er, it’s abig fat animal in Africa, Miss. Actually, this is a true story about mysinger-songwriter son Gareth who ignored school even more than I did. He wasdaydreaming in class one day when the teacher said: ‘Gareth, what’s achameleon?’ He wasn’t listening and so he didn’t hear her properly and he saidthat it was someone who told jokes. I had to put my underpants in the drier whenhe told me. Anyway, Pythagoras (around 570 to 495 BC) appears to have had aserious grasp of numbers and their relevance to reality. Among his reportedquotes are ‘All is number’ ... ‘Number is the within of all things’ and ‘Thereis geometry in the humming of the strings’. Yes, number is in all form and allform is geometry of some kind, and so geometry, whether balanced or imbalanced,can be found in everything in line with geometry’s definition as ‘shape, size,proportions, mathematical relationship and properties of space’. So the factthat ‘there is geometry in the humming of the strings’ does not only apply tomusical frequencies. Everything goes both ways, in fact every way, and sofrequency = geometry also means that geometry = frequency. This has massiveimplications for understanding holographic reality and the Matrix. It means thateverything, even apparently inanimate objects like buildings, statues andsymbols are vibrating to specific frequencies that relate to their ‘‘shape,size, proportions, mathematical relationship and properties of space’. Or, theillusion of space. So, and here we go, the proportions and shapes with which youbuild your buildings and their relationship to each other dictate the frequencythey will resonate individually and collectively across a town or city. MajorArchon bloodline cities are laid out with carefully designed street plans,buildings, statues and symbols for this reason. Together they generate thecollective energy field that suits the Archon agenda for human perceptiondeception. This is largely based on maintaining people in a low-vibrationalstate and subliminally implanting information and perception programs through awaveform, electromagnetic and digital connection. The collective energy fieldsgenerated through the manipulation of numbers and geometry operate like anunseen wireless Internet designed for people to unknowingly tap into and beinfluenced by. They are also doing this today by simply broadcasting thefrequencies through technology.The symbolism capitalsWashington DC is a living monument to the symbolism and numbers encoded intotowns and cities as we’ve seen to some extent already. It is awash with them atevery turn. Researchers have identified an inverted pentagram and a cube withina pyramid by connecting significant points in the Washington street plan withthe White House as the central point. In fact, it is a pyramid with the capstonemissing as with the dollar bill and the reverse of the Great Seal of the UnitedStates (Fig 474). It is said by some researchers that if you add a capstone tothis street plan pyramid using the same proportions on the Great Seal that theeye is placed over the House of the Temple, the headquarters of the SupremeCouncil of 33rd degree, Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry, at 1733 16th Street (Fig 475). The Temple has two sphinxes at thefront and the roof is built as a 13-step pyramid with the capstone missing. TheHouse of the Temple in Washington has 33 pillars, each 33 feet tall and thereare 33 members of the Supreme Council (Fig 476). The numbers 13 (numerologically4) and 33 (numerologically 6) are very important to Freemasonry, secretsocieties in general and Satanism. The Great Seal of the United States includes13 stars; 13 arrows; 13 leaves with 13 olives; and 13 stripes on the shield (Fig477). Again and again the number 13 appears in occultencoded religious storiesas in the deity and 12 followers. The most obvious example is Jesus and his 12disciples, but the theme is widespread. The number 33 is the same with Jesusperforming 33 miracles and dying at 33; King David reigned for 33 years; andJacob had 33 sons and daughters. It is all occult lore encoded in symbolicstories. The Jewish Tree of Life in the occult Kabbalah has a total of 33 pathsand points, including one that is said to be hidden. The United Nations logo,appropriately designed as a gun-sight aimed at the Earth, has 33 sections. Thehuman spine has 33 vertebrae including the fused bones in the lower spine. PopeJohn Paul I was murdered on his 33rd day in office when he acted to rid theVatican of Freemasonic influence. Researcher Scott Onstott has an excellentwebsite specialising in this information at www.secretsinplainsight.com[http://www.secretsinplainsight.com] and he has also made a video running tomore than three hours about the street plan of Washington DC and related themes,geometry and numbers. Researchers into the hidden geometry and mathematicsencoded all around us have found the same recurring numbers in ancient andmodern buildings, statues, symbols and even mummy masks of pharaohs. It is ineverything that the bloodline families do and have done and the same with thosewho were seeking to encode geometric harmony. Both motivations are working withthe same knowledge and only the application of that knowledge is different.Canary Wharf in East London alongside the Thames is but one example (Fig 478).It is a gigantic obelisk with a pyramid at the top that flashes a light from thecapstone. Obelisks are in part symbolic of the penis (bloodline) and the wordtranslates as ‘Baal’s shaft’ or ‘Baal’s organ of reproduction’. The WashingtonMonument in Washington DC, commemorating George Washington, the high Freemasonand first President of the United States, is the biggest stone obelisk in theworld. It makes a right angle in the street plan with both Capitol Hill and theWhite House (Figs 479). There are original ancient Egyptian obelisks in themajor bloodline cities of London, Rome, New York and Paris. The one in London onthe banks of the River Thames is known as Cleopatra’s Needle and was originallyerected in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis, the ‘City of the [Saturn] Sun’; theone in New York, also called Cleopatra’s Needle and from the same location, isin Central Park; the Paris obelisk is in the centre of the Place de la Concordewhich Princess Diana passed through minutes before her death (Fig 480); and the‘pagan’ obelisk in Rome is next to the Vatican in St Peter’s Square as we haveseen. The Paris obelisk with its golden tip was erected on the site of theguillotine (death/Saturn) which executed King Louis XVI and Queen MarieAntoinette during the Rothschildengineered French Revolution in the 18thcentury. The tip of the obelisk has been painted gold by the French authoritiesand this relates to the ancient Egyptian myth about the golden penis of theSaturn sun god, Osiris. The copper penis on the ‘alien’ figure on Credo Mutwa’sZulu Necklace of the Mysteries was also golden until it was stolen. The goldenpenis of the god or gods is a global legend. All this is symbolic of what theArchons believe to be the golden bloodline – theirs. Obelisks are profuselyemployed in the symbols and monuments of Freemasonry for this same reason andthere are some that believe that ancient obelisks and pyramids were part of anetwork generating electricity. Strange as it may sound some of the evidence iscompelling. Many skyscrapers are actually giant obelisks with a pyramid at thetop – Canary Wharf is only one of them. Cesar Pelli, the chief architect ofCanary Wharf (officially 1 Canada Square), had clearly studied the deeperaspects of reality and he quoted the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tse when heexplained what he was trying to achieve with the building:[../Images/00527.jpg]Figure 474: Pyramids, pentagrams and cubes.[../Images/00289.jpg]Figure 475: The ‘eye’ of the pyramid is said to correspond with the headquartersof the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite.[../Images/00374.jpg]Figure 476: The House of the Temple..[../Images/00514.jpg]Figure 477: The Great Seal of the United States.[../Images/00145.jpg]Figure 478: The Canary Wharf obelisk.[../Images/00566.jpg]Figure 479: The Washington street plan from the air and the obelisk/White Houserelationship.[../Images/00045.jpg]Figure 480: Original Egyptian obelisks in London, New York and Paris.> According to Lao Tse, the reality of a hollow object is in the void and not in> the walls that define it. He was speaking, of course, of spiritual realities.> These are the realities also of the Canary Wharf Tower. The power of the void> is increased and ... with its supporting structure creates a portal to the sky> ... a door to the infinite.[../Images/00283.jpg]Figure 481: Stone circles were built as crystalline transmitter-receivers ofinformation.Well, a door to something. It has never felt very ‘spiritual’ when I’ve beenthere. Canary Wharf was once the tallest freestanding building in Europe at 800feet and has been home to some of the biggest banking, corporate and media namesof the bloodline networks – Barclays, Citigroup, Clifford Chance, Credit Suisse,HSBC, J P Morgan, KPMG, MetLife, Morgan Stanley, Skadden, State Street, ThomsonReuters and Trinity Mirror Group Newspapers. The building contains nearly 4,000windows made from a form of crystal that we call glass. The ancients usedcrystalline rock for their stone circles and standing stones, just as the MormonChurch, which is undiluted Satanism at its inner core, used crystalline granitefor its temple in Salt Lake City. The stone circles, as with the later templesand churches, were built to be receivertransmitters of information from the‘gods’ (Fig 481). Crystals are used in receivertransmitter technology to thisday because they can receive, transmit, transform and stabilise frequencies.Crystalline structures can store phenomenal amounts of information indefinitely.Hitachi claimed in 2012 that it had developed a way of storing digitalinformation on slivers of quartz glass that will not degrade for hundreds ofmillions of years, possibly ever. There is information waiting to be extractedfrom crystalline stone circles, standing stones and ancient temples. These werebuilt at specific points on the Earth energy grid, just as important buildingsto the Archons such as churches, cathedrals, giant glass obelisks and domes arelocated for the same reason today.Britannia rules the wave ... lengthsThe major vortexes are part of a geometric pattern of energy points and forcelines that connect them. It has been established that many ancient structures,stone circles, pyramids and temples are geometrically aligned across thousandsof miles and different counties and continents; but if you place your structureson the meridian lines and vortexes they must by definition be in alignment witheach other because the grid is in alignment with itself. Controlling the grid isvital for Archons in controlling human perception. We are interacting with theEarth’s energy field (information field) for the entirety of our lives in thisreality and we are being constantly influenced ‘physically’, mentality andemotionally by the vibrational state of this field. The bloodlines and theirSatanic Demiurge-Archon worshipping cult use their advanced knowledge of thegrid to suppress the frequency of the Earth’s field and encode distortedinformation that suits their agenda. The geometrical design, proportions andlocation of their most important buildings are all part of this because theknowledge of numbers and geometry can turn buildings into receiver-transmitterson particular frequencies with the power of attraction or resistance. You cancreate energetic ‘dead’ zones by locating buildings that are little more thanstraight-line boxes at points on the grid where this geometry will stem thenatural flow of energy (information). Walk around the skyscraper ‘down-towns’built this way and the energy is in rigor mortis – the same when music is playedwith certain notes and keys. As I have already outlined, London and Britain arean especial focus in all this because the British Isles are an enormous powercentre on the global grid and what the Archons and their bloodlines do hereinfluences the global planetary field. The bloodline families knew this whenthey moved in and used this tiny landmass as the base for the biggest empire inknown human history. It wasn’t the size of the land that mattered to them, butthe ability to influence global perception from a location where so many majorenergy lines cross and interact. The British Isles have been an Archon focussince way before official history picks up the story with the emergence ofBritain as a global power. The Roman bloodline initiates knew about thesignificance of Britain, but they were only tapping into earlier knowledge. TheTrojan Wars are supposed to have happened in what is now Turkey and involvedbattles between the Greeks and the Trojans (of Troy, Turkey) between 1194 and1184 BC. The prime information source for this is said to be a poet called Homerin his works, the Iliad and the Odyssey. But those who have studied these worksin detail say that the land and sea being described could not possibly have beenin Turkey, but fit the bill perfectly for Britain. Iman Jacob Wilkens presentscompelling evidence in his book Where Troy Once Stood that the Trojan Wars tookplace in England and they led to London becoming the New Troy. The Celts calledLondon ‘Caer Troia’, or Town of Troy, and the Romans used the name ‘Troia Nova’,or New Troy, as well as Troynovant, Trinobantum and Londinium. It is my viewafter all these years of research that many of the invaders and settlers ofBritain that came from Europe and the Middle East were actually peoples who hadeither fled to those regions or expanded into them from Britain and werereturning home. The chronicler, Geoffrey of Monmouth (around 1100-1155), appearsto have based much of his historical narratives on earlier sources. This was thechap that introduced the stories of King Arthur. He wrote that Troia Nova wasestablished about 1100 BC by a man related to the kings of Troy, called Brutus,after whom the people became known as Britons. An ancient stone called theLondon Stone, now located under lock and key at an address in Cannon Street,London, is sometimes referred to as the Stone of Brutus after the Trojan whofounded what is now London. Brutus is said to have come from the Mediterraneanand landed with his group near today’s Totnes in Devon and spoke a languagedescribed as ‘Trojan’ or ‘crooked Greek’. London and the British Isles have beenseen as an important location since ancient times and this is because of theirenergetic connections. The famous hymn, Jerusalem, which never fails to stir thehearts of English patriots, continues this theme of Britain as the NewJerusalem. The words were penned by writer, artist and esoteric scholar, WilliamBlake:> And did those feet in ancient time> Walk upon England’s mountains green?> And was the holy Lamb of God> On England’s pleasant pastures seen?> And did the Countenance Divine> Shine forth upon our clouded hills?> And was Jerusalem builded here> Among these dark Satanic Mills?> Bring me my bow of burning gold!> Bring me my arrows of desire!> Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!> Bring me my chariot of fire!> I will not cease from mental fight,> Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,> Till we have built Jerusalem> In England’s green and pleasant landBut what is ‘Jerusalem’? This hymn is a particular favourite of exclusiveprivate schools – bizarrely known as ‘public schools’ in Britain – where thechildren of the El-ite are prepared to serve the agenda in the next generation.Among them is Eton College near Windsor Castle, just west of London, where theroyal children go along with those from the most El-ite aristocratic andsuper-rich families. Jerusalem was played at the royal wedding of Prince Williamand Kate Middleton. People sing these hymns but have no real idea what they’resinging; nor do the singers mean what they sing. I watched the crowds outsideWestminster Abbey singing along to Jerusalem during the royal wedding with thewords ...> Bring me my bow of burning gold!> Bring me my arrows of desire!> Bring me my spear! Oh clouds unfold!> Bring me my chariot of fire!> I will not cease from mental fight> Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand> Till we have built Jerusalem in England’s green and pleasant land.They sing it with such gusto; but if you said, right, here’s your bow, arrows,spear and chariot (with added fire as an optional extra) so go and build‘Jerusalem’, what would they do? There you go, everything you need that youasked for, mate, so what are you going to do now? ‘Don’t be daft, it’s just asong’, they would say, ‘I’m going down the pub’. Ah, the ‘New Jerusalem’ is apint of beer and ‘mental fight’ is a toasted cheese sandwich.The London time hijackOkay, so back to London’s Canary Wharf obelisk, one of countless examplesworldwide, designed to interact with the energy field in particular ways. Theobelisk is the penis or male in occult symbolism and the dome is the womb, orfemale. A symbolic womb was installed right across the River Thames from theCanary Wharf obelisk in the form of the Millennium Dome, now called the 02 Arena(Fig 482). The dome itself is one of the biggest of its kind in the world and itwas built amid years of controversy because of the extraordinary cost to theBritish taxpayer. The overall bill including grants from the National Lottery(British people) was some £700 million and it was later sold by the governmentfor £20 million to an American consortium to become a music and sports arena.The loss to the taxpayer was outrageous, but who cares when the bloodlines wantsomething done? It was inside the dome that the Queen and the rest of the royalfamily appeared with bloodline gofer Tony Blair on Millennium night to‘celebrate’ the arrival of the 21st century – give birth to the final stage ofthe Archon global hijack. It was pure ritual under a dome that is purelyritualistic in the intent behind its creation. The Canary Wharf obelisk and theMillennium Dome/02 Arena were created to focus certain energies in thatlocation. The Olympic Stadium, the focal point of the London Olympics and itsorgy of ritual and symbolism, was built in irradiated land close by. SteveClarke and other researchers of recurring numbers and geometry have found thatCanary Wharf and the 02 Arena dome fit the bill once again and appear to havesome sort of reciprocal harmonics. This makes absolute sense. I am not repeatingall the maths here that relate to building design, placement and theirconnection to recurring numbers and harmonics or we will disappear up our owndark place with all the numbers and codes; but you can easily find them on theInternet through a search engine using a combination of words like symbolism,numbers, geometry, harmonics, architecture, Washington DC and Illuminati. I justtried it and those words will get you there. Domes are often symbolic of theMoon and it was interesting to see that if you divide 2160 (the diameter of theMoon) by 1080 (the radius of the Moon) the answer is 2, or 02. The PrimeMeridian or ‘Greenwich Mean Time’ passes to the western side of the Dome andacross the river between the Dome and Canary Wharf. The Prime Meridian (0°longitude) is a line of some 20,000 kilometres, or more than 12,000 miles, whichcan be drawn from pole to pole and then it continues around the other side tocomplete a circle of the planet. The meridian passes through GreenwichObservatory on the hill above Canary Wharf and the Dome before it takes a coursebetween them. This line is where West officially meets East, or, put anotherway, it symbolises the corpus collosum between the two artificially-definedhemispheres of the planet (Fig 483). American President Chester A Arthur invitedrepresentatives from 25 countries to the International Meridian Conference inWashington DC in 1884 and they decided that Greenwich would be the PrimeMeridian. From that moment most of the world took London as the reference pointfrom which they perceived ‘time’ and London is a global centre for the Archonbloodlines and their occult network that manipulates the human perception oftime (Fig 484). Whatever the ‘time’ on any clock or watch, even on the otherside of the world, it was calculated by its relationship to the Prime Meridianor Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). A Greenwich Observatory guide says:[../Images/00302.jpg]Figure 482: The Millennium Dome, now the O2 Arena, with the Canary Wharf obeliskacross the river.[../Images/00135.jpg]Figure 483: The Greenwich Meridian.[../Images/00240.jpg]Figure 484: The point from which human ‘time’ is measured.> GMT is mean solar time, with midday defined as at the time at which the sun> crosses the Greenwich Meridian, 0 degrees longitude. Because the Earth’s orbit> is elliptical, the sun doesn’t appear to move against the stars at a constant> speed, so a hypothetical mean sun is used, imagined to travel at a constant> speed, the average of the sun’s actual speed. A second is defined as 1/86400th> of a mean solar day.People across the world decided their own version of time before thisstandardisation by the position of the Sun as it passed over their location andnot from some official time line located in London. A standard clock time andwatch time (completely manufactured ‘time’) was established the world over andLondon was its focal point. The illusion of time, as I said earlier, is one ofthe major ways that no-time Consciousness is detached from obsessed-with-timeBody-Mind. The standardisation of the perception of ‘time’ replaced local andindividual versions of time with everyone time. It is interesting, too, that thedefinition of a second was decreed to be 1/86400th of a ‘mean solar day’ whenthe diameter of the Sun is said to be 864,000 miles. The way the same numbersrecur when you get really deeply into this is incredible. The Greenwichobservatory was designed and built by high Freemason initiate Sir ChristopherWren (1632-1723) who also re-designed the bloodline satanic temple of St Paul’sCathedral with its world famous dome on Ludgate Hill in ‘The City’ on a site ofancient Roman worship of the Goddess Diana. This is where Princess Diana wasritually married to Prince Charles and where Wren is buried. He employed theunit of measurement known as cubits and many of his buildings in The City werelocated 2,000 cubits apart (just over half a mile) because the Mount of Oliveswas said to be 2,000 cubits from Jerusalem and the longest that a Jew wasallowed by ‘law’ to walk on the Sabbath (Saturn’s day). The cubit is based onthe forearm (the Egyptian hieroglyph for the cubit was a forearm) and this unitwas used in Egyptian pyramid building (the royal cubit) and in Mesopotamia andIndia among other places. Christopher Wren was a student of the Jewish kabbalahon which so much of this occult ritual is based. Wren rebuilt 51 churches in TheCity after the Great Fire of 1666 in league with Nicolas Hawksmoor, another highFreemason who became known as the ‘Devil’s Architect’ because of his love forpagan symbols and geometry. The Great Fire of London is supposed to have beenstarted accidentally in a baker’s shop in ‘Pudding Lane’, but London wasactually torched by the bloodlines to provide a blank sheet of land on whichthey could build their New London using all the energy-manipulating techniquesthat I am describing. It was a case of torch the place and then set the occultarchitects, like Wren and Hawksmoor, to work. It is estimated that the homes of70,000 of the 80,000 inhabitants were consumed by the fire that day in 1[666]along with government buildings, 87 parish churches and an earlier version of StPaul’s Cathedral. It was a blank sheet of land alright and it was cleared byfire after the Great Plague of London had already reduced the population by 20percent. Energetically-significant churches, especially major ones likeCathedrals, were not designed by Christians, but by assets of the bloodlinesecret society network. These included the Knights Templar who used theirknowledge of geometry and mathematics to produce temples which energeticallyconnect with their god and gods, the Demiurge and the Archons. They were locatedon ancient pagan sites which were earlier located at major vortex points on theEarth’s energy grid. The inner core of the Christian Church knows all thisbecause they are Satanists in disguise; but most of the rank and file clergy,middle management and even those in apparently leading positions like theArchbishop of Canterbury may have no idea at all, such is thecompartmentalisation of knowledge. It has to be like this or the game would havebeen exposed long ago. Greenwich Mean Time has since been replaced withUniversal Coordinated Time (UTC) but while this is administered from Paris itcontinues to use Greenwich Time as its starting point.All these strands of ‘time’, building and street plan geometry, recurringnumbers and letters etc., can all be brought together into a simple whole. Thedigital or number level of reality is an expression of the foundation waveformreality, the Metaphysical Universe. The digital-geometrical realm is an accesspoint to all the other levels of waveform, electrical/electromagnetic andholographic. Numbers and geometry can be used to harmonise with the universalorder, or, if you have a malevolent agenda, to distort and twist it. Ancientinitiates built many of their great structures before the infiltration with theformer in mind, but the Archon bloodlines use this knowledge and theirbuildings, street plans, churches, cathedrals, statues and symbols to distortreality and encode it with false and manipulative information, concepts andperceptions. They are doing this today more ferociously than ever becausehumanity is awakening and they are desperate to stop it."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00274.jpg]The Perception ParasitesAll our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions.Leonardo da VinciThis is a good point for a quick recap given how far we have come already. Welive in a fake reality generated by Awareness in an extreme state of distortionand dementia, but very skilled in the art of mass deception and inversion – thedistortion of balance and harmony (truth). Humans in this twisted state ofperception resonate energetically within the frequency band of this Awarenessand it can vampire human energy and feed its distortion. It’s an energeticfeedback loop.But humans have the capacity and potential to expand their own awareness and seebeyond the veil of the Matrix or at least see through lower levels of the Archonconspiracy, and so the war on human perception is ongoing all day, every day.The Demiurge-Archons (the Distortion) is seeking to manipulate humanity intobuilding and accepting a prison-cell reality in which they have no freedom ofexpression, movement, choice or even independent thought. This is the world thatOrwell and Huxley were describing from their insider knowledge of what wasplanned. The Archons want to cull an enormous percentage of the human populationand make the rest no more than drugged, microchipped and technologically‘enhanced’ (controlled) mind-zombies. The latter is now being promoted under thename ‘transhumanism’. The Obama Administration announced in 2013 a projectcosting billions of dollars over a decade to comprehensively ‘map’ the humanbrain as they said they did with the human genome. The project involves anightmare array of ‘team’ members that include federal agencies, privatefoundations, neuroscientists and nanoscientists. The New York Times described itas ‘a concerted effort to advance the knowledge of the brain’s billions ofneurons and gain greater insights into perception, actions and, ultimately,consciousness’. No, it is to gain greater insight into how to control thebrain’s decoded perceptions even more fundamentally than they are today. Slippedin among the bullshit reasons for the project was the real reason ... ‘[it has]the potential of paving the way for advances in artificial intelligence’.Thank-you, we got there in the end. The plan in short is to turn humans intoArchons under the control of Archons. I have emphasised that theDemiurge-Archons have no capacity for human emotion and a research study at theUniversity of Bristol in the west of England concluded that humans have devolvedemotionally in the last 100 years. They found that there had been a clear risein fear since the 1970s (Mmm, lunch) and a ‘massive decline’ in the expressionof emotions since 1900. The emotion of ‘disgust’ showed the lowest score – nosurprise given the way people have been desensitised to horrors happening in theworld through films, video games and the television news. Aldous Huxleydescribed in Brave New World how children would no longer be brought up or evenconceived by parents and instead they would be produced in laboratory batches atWorld State hatcheries in specific genetic types from an El-lite down to thehuman equivalent of worker ants. This would give them control of all children sothey could abuse them and vampire their energy at will. The blatant and constantattacks on the family unit and the erosion of parental rights to the state isthis plan unfolding – as are the shocking numbers of children taken from lovingparents by the state through a rigged secret court system and invented andspurious allegations of abuse. This is more inversion when those taking thechildren are the abusers. Not every time, of course, but often. I am the firstto say that children must be protected from abusive and uncaring parents, butthat is not what I am talking about here. I mean professional liars in SocialServices, law enforcement and the legal and court system hell-bent on takingtargeted children from parents that care for them. No one with a trace ofempathy and compassion could ever do that – but Archons employ Archons.Constantly increasing Archontic influence over humanity requires constantlycentralising power and the plan is to reach the stage where what happens in theworld is dictated by an El-lite of Archon bloodlines sitting around a singletable. This is the reason for the incessant centralisation of power in all areasof our lives including the European Union (with similar ones planned all overthe world), the food chain, biotechnology, energy supplies, medicine, media,military (NATO) and all the rest. Power is being concentrated in the hands of afew people and corporations under the heading of ‘globalisation’. The so-called‘Father of Globalisation’ is Peter D Sutherland, chairman of Goldman SachsInternational and inner-circle Bilderberger. What we call the ‘world’ and humanlife as it is currently experienced is a gigantic mind control program directingthe global population step-by-step into the Orwellian nightmare. I have beenstudying its techniques for nearly a quarter of a century and once you knowwhere it wants to take us and the mind and emotional manipulation techniques itemploys to take us there anyone can see through the lies and deceit.Silent Weapons for Quiet WarsThe perception deception that is the global conspiracy was clearly laid out in adocument that I have already highlighted, which I first came across in the early1990s. Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, sometimes referred to as Silent Weaponsfor a Quiet War, appears to be a training manual for new recruits to the globalconspiracy to explain how to direct economics and public perception to the pointwhere the population become life-long slaves to the few. I read Silent Weaponsagain while writing this book and it was sobering to see that all these yearslater the strategy the document details can be observed so clearly in worldevents and daily life. I mentioned the document at the start of the book but itis worth recapping at this stage in the light of where we are going from here.Silent Weapons was dated May 1979 and was apparently found in July 1986 in anIBM copier purchased at a surplus sale by an employee of Boeing. It appears tobe one of a series of such manuals explaining how the few control the many. Ican’t say for sure if it is genuine, but (a) it lays out the strategy inconsiderable detail and (b) what it describes is now blatantly happening by thehour. It defines silent weapons as social automation – the control of perceptionwhile the targets believe they are thinking freely and making their own choices,but they are not unless they have opened their minds to Awareness beyond thefive senses. The document says that the use of these silent weapons means that‘a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons andthe public’ and it describes the nature and consequence of these silent weaponsof perception control:> • Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a> silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.> • It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing,> instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,> instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by> a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking> magnate, instead of a military general.> • It makes no obvious explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental> injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone’s daily social life.> Yet it makes an unmistakable ‘noise’, causes unmistakable physical and mental> damage, and unmistakably interferes with the daily social life, i.e.,> unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for.> • The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that> they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.> • The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but [because> of] the technical nature of the silent weapon they cannot express their> feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore,> they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with> others to defend themselves against it.> • When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its> presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the> pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up. [As> the Nazi Angel of Death Joseph Mengele said: ‘The more we do to you, the less> you seem to believe we are doing it.’]> • Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the> vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing,> understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social> energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.This is precisely the way that the global population is being manipulated enmasse (not least through manufactured economic pressure and chaos) to consent totheir own enslavement. Ahh, but there’s no conspiracy, right? No, no. This isall a coincidence. Go back to sleep, there’s nothing to see here. We’repoliticians, law enforcement officers and journalists. Trust us. People likethat Icke bloke are just paranoid nutters. The Silent Weapons document says thepublic adjusts/adapts to the silent weapon and learns to tolerate itsencroachment on their lives ‘until the pressure (psychological via economic)becomes too great and they crack up’. In the United States in 2013 suicide hadpassed car accidents as the biggest cause of death through injury; more Americantroops died by suicide in 2012 than in combat; a third of American workerssuffer from chronic debilitating stress; more than half of 18 to 33 year oldsquestioned report levels of stress that keep them awake at night; 11 percent ofall Americans over 12 are taking antidepressants; 6.4 million American childrenbetween 4 and 17 are prescribed Ritalin or similar drugs; 23 percent of allAmerican women in their 40s and 50s – nearly one in four – are takingantidepressants; 28 percent of American adults have a drinking problem. None ofthis is confined to the United States either (anti-depressants are an epidemicin Britain) and it is the human population ‘cracking up’ under the pressure fromthe silent weapon of social engineering. Edward Bernays (1891-1995), theRothschild Zionist ‘Father of Public Relations’, said:> Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible> government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our> minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we> have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our> democratic society is organized ...> ... In almost every act of our lives, whether in the sphere of politics or> business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by> the relatively small number of persons ... who understand the mental processes> and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires that control> the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind> and guide the world.Silent Weapons explains how vital it is for the success of the Control System togather highly-detailed information on people to compile the data from which theycan design and adjust their perception engineering to achieve maximumefficiency. This is where the Internet comes in big time. It was reported thatFacebook is trying to manipulate its hundreds of millions of users to transfertheir email accounts to the Facebook version – and has done so by simplyremoving the user’s own email address on profile pages and replacing it with a@facebook.com [@facebook.com] address. The company said it had acted to makedetails ‘consistent’ across its site. Pull the other leg it’s ringing.Consistent with exploiting its customers on behalf of a greater power more like.These parasites have no shame. Facebook admitted in a quarterly filing for theSecurities and Exchange Commission that as many as 83 million of its accountsare fake. How many of those are connected to the Intelligence industry? Facebookhas also bought the Israeli facerecognition company Face.com and there is anoperation called Facedeals, the work of Redpepper, a Nashville-based advertisingagency, which they want to roll out worldwide. Facedeals entices people with thepromise of price reductions in shops and bars to add their Facebook picture tothe system. The image is then recognised by a camera at the business location.It is another example of how social (engineering) networking sites are beingused to persuade people to hand over their personal data and freedoms under theguise of ‘good deals’ or ‘social interaction’. Yet despite the obvious invasionsof freedom and privacy there are magazines and websites which suggest that notusing Facebook should arouse suspicion. The German magazine Der Taggspiegel feltthe need to point out that the clearly mind-controlled James Holmes, accused ofthe Colorado movie theatre killings, and Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik,did not have Facebook profiles. Wow, that explains it, then. PsychologistChristopher Moeller (physician heal thyself) told the magazine that usingFacebook was a sign of having a healthy social network when it is actually asign that you are handing over personal and private details to the authoritieswithout them even having to secure legislation to do it (Fig 485). The world ismad. What a coincidence that Rothschild Zionists officially created and/orcontrol Google, Yahoo, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, eBay,Amazon, etc., etc. Amazon’s game plan to take control of the global bookpublishing industry through its e-book system and then dictate the cover price,Amazon’s commission and, eventually, whether something will be published at allonce electronic books and the Amazon system dominate the market. Does anyonereally believe that frontmen like Mark Zuckerberg (Rothschild Zionist) arereally calling the shots at the Facebook corporation and others? Zuckerberglooks to me like an extra from Peter Pan and I have long thought that there is awhole backstory about him we haven’t been told. Search engines, networking sitesand cell-phone companies are trawling and retaining information about theirusers, legally and illegally, and this is right in line with the demands ofSilent Weapons for Quiet Wars. The document says that another aspect of gleaninginformation is price-shock testing. This is when a product or commodity, likefuel, is artificially hiked in price very quickly, even overnight, and ‘theresulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically bycomputers and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered’.The document goes on:[../Images/00074.jpg]Figure 485: Do it yourself survellience.> Eventually every individual element of the structure comes under computer> control through a knowledge of personal preferences, such knowledge guaranteed> by computer association of consumer preferences (universal product code, UPC;> zebra-striped pricing codes on packages) with identified consumers (identified> via association with the use of a credit card and later a permanent ‘tattooed’> body number invisible under normal ambient illumination).The latter, of course, is the microchip that I have been warning about for morethan two decades. These people see humans as no more than guinea pigs in amass-perception laboratory. Silent Weapons says of the mind-manipulationindustry known as ‘advertising’:> If a person is spoken to by a TV advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old,> then, due to suggestibility, he will, with a certain probability, respond or> react to that suggestion with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and> will reach into his economic reservoir and deliver its energy to that product> on impulse when he passes it in the store.Silent Weapons expands on the process of price-shocks:> Economic engineers achieve the same result in studying the behavior of the> economy and the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity such> as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar, and then causing a sudden change or shock> in its price or availability, thus kicking everybody’s budget and buying> habits out of shape. They then observe the shock waves which result by> monitoring the changes in advertising, prices, and sales of that and other> commodities.> The objective of such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public> economy into a predictable state of motion or change, even a controlled> self-destructive state of motion which will convince the public that certain> ‘expert’ people should take control of the money system and re-establish> security (rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens> are rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course,> become totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor.Remember that this was written in the 1970s and look at the world today. We havea had an unelected banker as Prime Minister in Greece and we have an unelectedbanker and an entire cabinet of unelected bankers and academics (technocrats) inItaly justified by appointing ‘experts’ to solve engineered economic crises. Itis straight off the pages of Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars. The documentcontinues:> Not only the prices of commodities, but also the availability of labor can be> used as the means of shock testing. Labor strikes deliver excellent tests> shocks to an economy, especially in the critical service areas of trucking> (transportation), communication, public utilities (energy, water, garbage> collection), etc.> By shock testing, it is found that there is a direct relationship between the> availability of money flowing in an economy and the real psychological outlook> and response of masses of people dependent upon that availability.Booms and busts, war and peace, price-hikes, even many strikes, are allcarefully calculated on the basis of energy output, input and consequence.Silent Weapons highlights the dangers of intelligent people becoming aware ofthe way the system works, and to what end, and it says that ‘the speed withwhich they can communicate their warning to the public will largely depend uponhow effective we have been at controlling the media, subverting education, andkeeping the public distracted with matters of no real importance’. Here you havethe reason why the mainstream media won’t touch the subjects in this book andwhy anyone speaking out about them is dubbed a crazy ‘conspiracy theorist’. Herewe go – back with the themes that lie at the core of human suppression: controlof information through the media; control of knowledge through the ‘educationsystem’; and diverting attention from the magicians’ hands and the lady in thesequins nipping down the trap door underneath the covered cage from which thereis allegedly ‘no escape’. These diversions and controls can be listed undercategories such as: the latest crap from Simon Cowell; the latest ‘must-have’built-in-obsolescence from Apple; television ‘news’, in fact any mainstreamnews; sport when it goes beyond mere entertainment into something of seriousimportance; rock stars, movie stars and ‘celebrity’ tittle-tattle; and thelatest ‘fashion’, latest gimmick, latest ‘thing’. Silent Weapons lays out thebattle plan for the war on perception. This includes targeting the psyche of thepeople by:> • Disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a> low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design> and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.> • Engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their> indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by: Unrelenting emotional> affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of a constant> barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media – especially the TV and the> newspapers.> • Giving them what they desire – in excess – ‘junk food for thought’ and> depriving them of what they really need.> • Rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation> [tell them religious and ‘scientific’ bollocks about the nature of reality],> thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly> fabricated outside priorities.The manual says that these tactics ‘preclude their interest in and discovery ofthe silent weapons of social automation technology’. It notes that the generalrule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit.‘Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions.’ Igave this technique the name a long time ago of Problem-Reaction-Solution and Iwill be coming to this shortly. As I said earlier, this is how Silent Weaponsencapsulates the Archontic methodology:> Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social> issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance; Schools: Keep the> young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real> history; Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade> level; Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on> the farm with the other animals.This is precisely the world that we live in. The manual also describes its causeand effect, input-output, techniques. This is what you do and this is what youget:> • Keep the public ignorant and you have less public organisation.> • Create preoccupations and you lower defences.> Attack the family unit and you control the education of the young.> • Give out less cash and more credit and you trigger more self-indulgence and> social engineering data.> • Encourage social conformity and you make programming easier.> • Minimise protests about tax and you maximise the input of personal economic> data while minimising enforcement problems.> • Stabilise consent and you stabilise control.> • Tighten control of variables [like individuality] and you have greater> predictability.> • Maximise control and you minimise resistance to control.> • Collapse the currency and you destroy faith in a country and each other.All this is in line with the goals of the Rothschild Zionist Frankfurt Schoolwhich has been the manipulating force behind the scourge that is ‘politicalcorrectness’. The Frankfurt School was established in 1923 in the home city ofthe Rothschilds in Germany. It later moved to Switzerland and then New Yorkbefore settling in California which became the global centre of politicalcorrectness thanks to these people. Political correctness is just another scamto silence opinions and information that the manipulators do not want to becirculated and discussed and it employs the most programmed section of thetarget population to eliminate the freedom of expression of other sections. Thefounders and early major players and influences of the Rothschild FrankfurtSchool included Carl Grünberg (Rothschild Zionist), Max Horkheimer (RothschildZionist), Theodor W Adorno (Rothschild Zionist) and Herbert Marcuse (RothschildZionist). The organisation was funded into existence by Felix Weil (RothschildZionist) and this has been the wish list it has been working towards since the1920s:> • The creation of racism offences.> • Continual change to create confusion.> • The teaching of sex and homosexuality to children.> • The undermining of schools and teachers’ authority.> • Huge immigration to destroy national identity.> • The promotion of excessive drinking.> • Emptying of churches (undermining of any form of social cohesion).> • Legal system with bias against victims of crime.> • Dependency on the state or state benefits (before you delete them, as is> happening now).> • Control and dumbing down of the media.> • Encouraging the breakdown of the family.The point about ‘huge immigration to destroy national identity’ can clearly beseen in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Rothschild gofer PeterMandelson (Rothschild Zionist), the Svengali to British Labour Prime MinistersTony Blair and Gordon Brown, admitted in 2013 that their governments were‘sending out search parties’ to increase immigration. Annual net immigrationsoared from 48,000 to some 200,000 between when Blair came to power in 1997 andwhen his brief successor Brown was ousted in early 2010. The scale on which thetransformation of human society has been planned and covertly orchestrated isextraordinary and everything is founded on the manipulation of perception.Silent Weapons points out that there is a ‘measurable quantitative relationshipbetween the price of gasoline and the probability that a person would experiencea headache, feel a need to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to atavern for a mug of beer’. This is perfectly valid because they are notoperating this system within holographic (‘physical’) reality. The holographicis only the plasma screen on which the outcome is played out as a done deal.They are operating in what I have called the Metaphysical Universe – thewaveform information construct from which everything else comes. At that levelthe energy fields of money and the economic system can directly interact withand influence and change the human energy field and in doing so dictate humanresponse, emotion and behaviour. The document says:> It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economic models by> which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from reality, and> by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Research, it is possible to> program computers to predict the most probable combination of created events> (shocks) which will bring about a complete control and subjugation of the> public through a subversion of the public economy (by shaking the plum tree).This is what was done so coldly in 2008 and is now manifesting as ever-deepeningeconomic chaos and social catastrophe in America and Europe, especially, for themoment, in countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus with so manymore to come. The effect on the wider world dependent on the US and Europeaneconomies is equally if not even more catastrophic. Silent Weapons lists theareas that the El-ite seeks to control to most effectively direct human affairs.It says that the Control System:> Allocates opportunities; destroys opportunities; controls the economic> environment; controls the availability of raw materials; controls capital;> controls bank rates; controls the inflation of the currency; controls the> possession of property; controls industrial capacity; controls manufacturing;> controls the availability of goods (commodities); controls the prices of> commodities; controls services, the labour force, etc; controls payments to> government officials; controls the legal functions; controls the personal data> files – uncorrectable by the party slandered; controls advertising; controls> media contact; controls material available for TV viewing; disengages> attention from real issues; engages emotions; creates disorder, chaos, and> insanity; controls design of more probing tax forms; controls surveillance;> controls the storage of information; develops psychological analyses and> profiles of individuals; controls sociological factors; controls health> options; preys on weakness; cripples strengths; leaches wealth and substance.Once again this was written in the 1970s. All of this requires public consentand acquiescence given the size of the target population compared with thenumber of Archontic conspirators working in full knowledge of what the game is.The mass mindmanipulation has to constantly secure human consent for humancontrol until they have so much power that this is no longer necessary. A simpleexample is to persuade you to have a store loyalty card and then sell on thedata to insurance companies and employers detailing the types of food you buy.They then compile ‘risk profiles’ from this information to assess your insurancerates and employment potential. No, this is not a joke, it is happening. TheWall Street Journal reported the following in an article headed ‘How the InsurerKnows You Just Stocked Up on Ice Cream and Beer’:> Your company already knows whether you have been taking your meds, getting> your teeth cleaned and going for regular medical checkups. Now some employers> or the insurance companies are tracking what staffers eat, where they shop and> how much weight they are putting on — and taking action to keep them in line.This is an example of consent (though without knowledge of the consequences) inthat people accept the loyalty cards which allow this to happen, but muchconsent is unconscious and comes about by inaction rather than action. Notopting out is giving consent just the same as opting in. Silent Weaponsdescribes how the system depends on personal data and information being handedover by ‘a docile public’ through ‘legal (but not always lawful) force’ –especially in tax documents. ‘Furthermore, the number of such forms submitted tothe [tax authorities] is a useful indicator of public consent, an importantfactor in strategic decision making.’ It goes on:> When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without> just compensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender> and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily> quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay> income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the> government.And that is where we are today. How much more are we prepared to take and howmuch longer are we prepared to take it? Answer that question and you willaccurately predict what is to come: Freedom or Fascism? That is the question andwe still have the power to decide the answer – but not for much longer if thecollective arse and sofa continue their current relationship.Mind gamesSo that is the basic structure of how the few manipulate the many to impose thewill of the few upon the many. In other words, manipulating humans to buildtheir own prison while not realising that this is what they are doing. TheArchons do not have creative imagination and so they cannot create anything from‘scratch’, including a global prison state. They have to manipulate humans whodo have creative imagination to do it for them. There are two fundamental massmind and emotional manipulation techniques that are constantly employed by thebloodlines to that end. I gave them the names many years ago now ofProblem-Reaction-Solution (P-R-S) and the Totalitarian Tiptoe (TT). I have givencountless examples in books since the early 1990s of these techniques at work,but briefly this is the modus operandi: Problem-Reaction-Solution is designed toprovide the excuses to impose what the Archon agenda demands because they knowthat without the manufactured excuse and fake justification there would bepublic opposition that could thwart their evil ambitions. In stage one of PRSyou covertly instigate a problem and blame it on someone or something else. Thiscould be an engineered terrorist attack, financial collapse, epidemic and so on.In stage two you tell the population through an ignorant, corrupt and patheticmainstream media the version of the manufactured problem that you want them tobelieve. You want to trigger a public reaction of fear, outrage and demands that‘something must be done’. Then in stage three you openly offer the solution tothe problems that you have covertly instigated. The Freemasons call thistechnique Ordo Ab Chao – order out of chaos – which is the motto for the 33rddegree of the Scottish Rite. Before you can impose your new order you first haveto create the chaos that destroys the old order. Here you have the reason whythe world is in a constant state of engineered chaos and upheaval. The morechaos, the more change – their change. Problem-Reaction-Solution is played outall over the world hour-by-hour by the Archon bloodlines and their ControlSystem and it is the most effective technique of mass perception manipulation.You cannot control billions of people ‘physically’ when you are so few and theyare so many and so you must program the perceptions of the many to see worldevents and reality in general in ways that suit your game-plan. One of the mostobvious Problem-Reaction-Solutions was 9/11when the villains were sold to publicperception as a bunch of Islamic extremist fanatics who struggled to flyone-engine Cessnas (many couldn’t even do that) but somehow on that one day theymanaged to manifest the ability to fly wide-bodied jets with such amazing skillwhen professional airline pilots with decades of experience have told me thatthey couldn’t have done it. The fantasy ‘leader’ of these ‘Islamic extremistfanatics’ Mohamed Atta, drank alcohol, ate pork, had a non-Muslim Americangirlfriend and ran drugs for the CIA through the very Venice airport in Floridawhere he and others supposedly learned to fly in oneengine planes to prepare forhijacking wide-bodied jets. In fact, the planes on 9/11 were remotely-controlledand not even the aircraft that left Boston, Washington and Newark that morning.I have taken apart the ludicrous official story of September 11th in Alice inWonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster, the first major book to exposethe extraordinary catalogue of lies and deceit, and there are lengthy and highlysignificant updates in The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy and HumanRace Get Off Your Knees. The ratio of Rothschild Zionists involved before,during and after 9/11 is absolutely staggering and you’ll find the background inHuman Race (Fig 486). You can also go to the 9/11 archive at Davidicke.com[http://www.Davidicke.com] where you will find a stream of videos and articlesdemolishing the official fairy-tale. I am not going to repeat all the detailhere, but I will put what happened in the context of Problem-Reaction-Solution.[../Images/00437.jpg]Figure 486: Rothschild Zionists were everywhere before, during and after 9/11.The 9/11 attacks and were supposedly orchestrated by a bloke with a beard in acave in Afghanistan called Osama bin Laden who had been the CIA’s pin-up boy andfrontman for the proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union in the1980s after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Bin Laden was the ‘leader’ ofthe American funded, trained and armed Afghanistan ‘freedom fighters’ known asthe Mujahedeen, from which were spawned the Taliban (see Remember Who You Are).Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter,co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, long-time mentor to Barack Obama andserious Archon insider, admitted in the French news magazine, Le NouvelObservateur, that he had ordered the funding and training of the Mujahedeen tochallenge the Soviet satellite government in the Afghan capital, Kabul, in aneffort to entice the Soviet Union to invade and give them what he called ‘theirVietnam’. It worked and a million Afghans died as a result, but these peoplecouldn’t give a shit because they have no empathy. The ‘war on terror’ justifiedby 9/11 to destroy ‘Al-Qaeda’ has been the excuse to bomb country after countryand delete basic freedoms for domestic populations worldwide. ‘Al-Qaeda’ means‘The Base’, or more literally the Database, and was named after the CIA databaseof Mujahedeen fighters. It was a CIA invention and did not exist in anythinglike the form that has been claimed. This was confirmed by former BritishForeign Secretary Robin Cook in July 2005 and within a month he was dead on aScottish mountain. Ironically, Arabic forces who were targeted by the US andBritain on the basis that the mythical ‘Al-Qaeda’ existed have since formedgroups calling themselves ‘Al-Qaeda’ because they were mind-scammed every bit asmuch as the people of America, Canada, Britain, Europe, Australia and elsewhere.Where’s that beam, Scotty? Even a rare incisive documentary by the BBC confirmedthat there had been no ‘Al-Qaeda’ at the time of 9/11 and revealed how ‘gunmen’surrounding Bin Laden in video footage had been told to turn up for the day andto bring their own weapons. It was all for show, not for real. Jamal AhmedMohamed al-Fadl, a former associate of Bin Laden, gave the American authoritiesthe ‘evidence’ they demanded that ‘Al-Qaeda’ existed as an extensive network inreturn for ‘a huge amount of money’, according to Jason Burke, author ofAl-Qaeda. American agencies decided whatever they wanted the public to believeabout Al-Qaeda and then paid this Sudanese bloke to tell them exactly that. The‘war on terror’ (war on freedom) has been ‘fought’ at such stunning cost indeath, destruction and the deletion of freedoms and all has been justified byfighting a ‘terrorist organisation’ that did not exist. Sibel Edmonds, anIranian-American former FBI translator and founder of the National SecurityWhistleblowers Coalition, translated communications between Islamic radicals inthe wake of 9/11 and she said that Bin Laden and his associate, Aymanal-Zawahiri, continued to work with the US government for three months after theattacks to destabilise the Caucasus region in Southern Russia that includescountries like Georgia, Chechnya and Dagestan. This was at the same time thatthe Bush administration was saying that they must invade Afghanistan to ‘get BinLaden’. Edmonds connects Bin Laden to Operation Gladio which began after theSecond World War and specialises in carrying out attacks that are blamed ontarget groups the instigators wish to demonise and used to justify increasedgovernment powers. Operation Gladio was the work of British and Americanintelligence but has involved operatives from many countries, most notably Italywhere one of its attacks was the Bologna railway station bombing in 1980 whichkilled 85 people and was blamed on a terrorist group called the Red Brigades todemonise communists. An Italian parliamentary investigation in 2000 heard thatthe bombing was actually carried out by ‘men inside Italian state institutionsand ... men linked to the structures of United States intelligence.’ Yes, seeHenry Kissinger. Former Gladio agent Vincenzo Vinciguerra said in sworntestimony:> You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people,> unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite> simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public, to turn> to the state to ask for greater security. This is the political logic that> lies behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished,> because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what> happened.In other words ... Problem-Reaction-Solution. Sibel Edmonds said that Bin Ladenand Zawahiri worked for NATO and the Pentagon as part of Operation Gladio whichcontinues to this day. She said:> For the past 11 years I have been emphasizing that my State Secrets Privilege> and Gag Orders had to do with the FBI files (covering period 1996-2002> February) on covert-terrorist operations in Caucasus and Central Asia backed,> managed and armed by US actors. These US-NATO directed operations in the> region involved Bin-Laden and mainly Zawahiri ...> ... The FBI documents contained damning evidence (audio and written) collected> between 1996-2002 tying these terror operations directly to the U.S. persons> in the State Department/CIA and Pentagon. Also, how the State Department got> Congress to grant huge amounts of funds to ‘front’ NGOs and businesses (mainly> Turkish companies in USlisted/members of ATC) to funnel money to the terrorist> cells in this region.The Boston Marathon bombings in 2013 were also connected to this and were blamedon two ethnic Chechen brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan andmembers of his family had FBI and CIA connections in America and the Caucasusand once again the official story of those bombings is a joke (see Postcript).The late Aaron Russo, the award-winning film-maker who produced Trading Placeswith Eddie Murphy, realised that the conspiracy was real from his conversationswith the Archon Nick Rockefeller who tried to recruit him into the Council onForeign Relations (Fig 487). Russo began to speak out from 2007 about howRockefeller had told him almost a year before 9/11 that he would be seeingsoldiers looking for Osama bin Laden in caves in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Therewould be an ‘endless war on terror where there’s no real enemy’, and the wholething would be a ‘giant hoax’ to allow the government to take over the people.Rockefeller said that there would be an invasion of Afghanistan to build oilpipelines to the oil and gas-rich Caspian Sea (which borders Iran). He said thatthey would also invade Iraq to seize oil fields and establish a base in theMiddle East. Russo described how Rockefeller cynically laughed and joked as hewas detailing the horrors awaiting humanity including compulsory microchippingfor ‘the serfs’ as he called them that would allow the El-lite to rule theworld. Rockefeller constantly stressed that ‘the people have to be ruled’.Destroying the family unit is a prime target of the conspiracy and Rockefellertold Russo that the Rockefeller Foundation had created and bankrolled thewomen’s liberation movement to destroy the family. This meant that women couldbe taxed as well as men and children would go to school earlier to beindoctrinated to accept that the state was their primary family (straight fromthe pages of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World). This is the Archon mentality thatwe are dealing with – arrogant, narcissistic to the extreme of extremes and withno compassion or empathy for the victims of their soulless, heartless ambitions.They are also, ultimately, bloody stupid and moronic as well because eventuallywhen the Hack is broken – and it will be – the consequences for them are goingto be unimaginable. Aaron Russo made an excellent film well worth watchingcalled America: Freedom to Fascism. Susan Lindauer, an American journalist andanti-war activist, says that she was a ‘back channel’ for the CIA innegotiations and communications with Iraq and Libya before 9/11. A back channelis someone who acts as a go-between outside of the official channels and shesays that she had some 800 to 1,000 meetings with US Intelligence agencies and150 to 170 with both Iraq and Libya. When Lindauer began to speak out about 9/11and what she knew she was arrested and charged with being a spy for Iraq, butthe charges were dropped because they didn’t stand up. She said that the USIntelligence community knew about the 9/11 attacks throughout the summer of 2001and that they would involve aircraft and the Twin Towers. Lindauer said: ‘9/11was done by us ... We did it. Okay, and by ‘we’ I know that it is not the peopleof New York, I know that it is not all members of the CIA, definitely not ...However, it was done by the Americans, we did this.’ She confirmed thatso-called ‘lead-hijacker’ Mohamed Atta was a trained CIA asset (something Irevealed in previous books) and she said:[../Images/00219.jpg]Figure 487: Aaron Russo with Nick Rockefeller. If the ‘tached one’ is an exampleof the super race I’ll give it a miss, thanks.> ...if there were any hijackers, if there were any indigenous hijackers we> identified them. We created them as the FBI does with all the other terrorist> attacks, they are all fake attacks. The FBI recruits some dumb mixed up kid,> some unstable individual and tries to get them to do something and that is> exactly what they would have done on 9/11.Lindauer is referring here to the list of ‘terrorist attacks’ claimed to havebeen ‘foiled’ by the FBI which have turned out to involve not very bright assetsof the FBI recruited to take the rap so the FBI can take the credit while thethreat of terrorism in America is highlighted in the media to justify furtherdeletions of freedom. She said that 9/11 was a ‘cover and deception operation’:> It was like a magicians trick, they used the airplanes because they knew you> would look at the airplanes and you would in your mind you would see cause and> effect. Oh, the airplane hit the tower, oh the tower collapses, therefore the> airplane fire brought down the towers. Obviously that is not what happened ...> ... I want you to see how 9/11 fits into the context of all other terrorism> like the USS Cole and the 93 World Trade Centre attack and Oklahoma City. We> always know people, it would never happen that we couldn’t notice, we do know> it, we have too many contacts, there is too much technology ... and if it> happens it is because they deliberately chose to let it happen.Lindauer said that the ‘Al-Qaeda’ bomb attack on the USS Cole in the Yemen portof Aden on October 12th 2000, which killed 17 sailors and injured 39, wasallowed to happen by US authorities to force Yemen to accept US demands –another Problem-Reaction-Solution:> I personally notified the CIA and the Defence Intelligence Agency that the> Iraqis were warning about an attack on the port in Aden, Yemen and then I> turned around and went back to New York and notified the deputy Ambassador of> Yemen who was a personal friend of mine ... the night of the Yemen attack they> pulled the standard guard off the USS Cole, knowing the attack was imminent,> they pulled the guard doing duty and pulled back all the protocols for> protecting the ship so that the attack could occur ...> ... The United States allowed the USS Cole to be bombed because we wanted to> use that as a pretext ... to force the Yemeni Government to cooperate with US> anti-terrorism initiative and so before the USS Cole was ever attacked I> personally sat down with my friend, the Deputy Ambassador of Yemen at the> United Nations in New York, and we had dinner and I talked with him about how> this attack was going to occur and how the Yemeni Government had better start> thinking fast on its feet how they were going to cooperate with the United> States. This is a year before 9/11.The mentality behind the attacks of September 11th is there for all to see. Theycouldn’t care less who they kill and maim, including on their own illusory‘side’, so long as it benefits their sick agenda. Even the New York Timesreported on the FBI’s long record of faking terrorist attacks:> The United States has been narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in> recent years – or so it has seemed. A would-be suicide bomber was intercepted> on his way to the Capitol; a scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot Stinger> missiles at military aircraft was developed by men in Newburgh, N.Y.; and a> fanciful idea to fly explosive-laden model planes into the Pentagon and the> Capitol was hatched in Massachusetts.> But all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I., whose undercover agents> and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy missile, fake C-4> explosives, a disarmed suicide vest and rudimentary training. Suspects naïvely> played their parts until they were arrested.’Writer and researcher Trevor Aaronson studied the history of FBI-created ‘terrorplots’ for his book, The Terror Factory. He said of these FBI patsy‘terrorists’:> They’re actually almost entirely bumbling morons who couldn’t tie their own> shoes or buy the laces without FBI instigation and support. The FBI plants the> ideas, makes the plans, provides the fake weapons and money, creates the> attempted act of terrorism, makes an arrest, and announces the salvation of> the nation.> Over and over again. The procedure has become so regular that intended marks> have spotted the sting being worked on them simply by Googling the name or> phone number of the bozo pretending to recruit them into the terrorist> brotherhood, and discovering that he’s a serial informant ...> ... Most of the rest charged with ‘terrorism’ had little or nothing to do with> terrorism at all, most of them charged with more minor offenses like> immigration offenses or making false statements. Three or four people out of> the whole list appear to be men whom one would reasonably call terrorists in> the commonly accepted sense of the word.Mother Jones magazine and the Investigative Reporting Program at the Universityof California-Berkeley investigated the cases of 508 defendants interrorism-related cases and found the following:> • Nearly half the prosecutions involved the use of informants, many of them> ‘incentivized’ by money (operatives can be paid as much as $100,000 per> assignment) or the need to work off criminal or immigration violations.> • Sting operations resulted in prosecutions against 158 defendants. Of that> total, 49 defendants participated in plots led by an agent provocateur – an> FBI operative instigating terrorist action.> • With three exceptions, all of the high-profile domestic terror plots of the> last decade were actually FBI stings.> • In many sting cases, key encounters between the informant and the target> were not recorded – making it hard for defendants claiming entrapment to prove> their case.All this is essential background to understanding what happened on September11th, 2001. Problem-Reaction-Solution or ‘false-flag’ staged attacks fall intothree main categories: 1) When elements within the government-military complexcarry out the attack and blame innocent patsies; 2) When they covertlyagent-provocateur others to organise the attack (a speciality of the FBI); 3)When the government-military complex is aware of a genuine plot and allows it tohappen when it could have been stopped. The horrors of 9/11 were a terribleexample of number 1.In plain sightThe Bush administration was controlled by a Rothschild Zionist grouping calledthe Project for the New American Century which included Dick Cheney, DonaldRumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Dov Zakheim, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, DouglasFeith, William Kristol and Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby. These are the people whoseized control of the White House and the Pentagon before, during and after9/11. Cheney became Vice-President (de facto President to ‘what’s my name?’George Bush); Convicted crook Libby was Cheney’s ‘advisor’; Rumsfeld was madeSecretary of Defence with Wolfowitz as his ‘deputy’ (de facto Secretary ofDefence); Zakheim became comptroller at the Pentagon in control of all spendingand he managed to ‘lose’ trillions of dollars on his watch. This was announcedSeptember 10th 2001, but few will have noticed after what happened the next day– a next day they well knew was coming. Richard Perle and Douglas Feith wereboth Pentagon-connected and William Kristol provided the propaganda through histhen Murdoch-owned Weekly Standard and constant appearances on TV newsprogrammes, especially on Murdoch’s Fox News. In September 2000, a year to themonth before 9/11 and just months before they came to power with the Bushadministration, the Project for the New American Century published a documententitled Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources for aNew Century which called for American forces to ‘fight and decisively winmultiple, simultaneous major theater wars’ with emphasis on places like Iraq,Iran and North Korea, but also including ‘dangerous regimes’ in Libya and Syria.These crazies also called for the instigation of regime change in China (WorldWar III). The document said that this plan would need an excuse to win publicand political support because the ‘... process of transformation ... is likelyto be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a newPearl Harbor’. One year to the month later came what George Bush called ‘ourPearl Harbor’ and the ‘multiple, simultaneous major theater wars’ began and arestill going on involving the very countries the document listed. General WesleyClark, NATO’s former Supreme Allied Commander Europe, confirmed in a televisioninterview in 2007 that what has happened in terms of wars in the Middle East andNorth Africa was planned at least by 2001, but in fact it was way before then.He said:> About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary> Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello> to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of> the generals called me in. He said, ‘Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me> a second.’ I said, ‘Well, you’re too busy.’ He said, ‘No, no.’ He says, ‘We’ve> made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.’ This was on or about the 20th> of September. I said, ‘We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?’ He said, ‘I don’t> know.’ He said, ‘I guess they don’t know what else to do.’> So I said, ‘Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to> al-Qaeda?’ He said, ‘No, no.’ He says, ‘There’s nothing new that way. They> just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.’ He said, ‘I guess it’s like we> don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we> can take down governments.’ And he said, ‘I guess if the only tool you have is> a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.’> So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing> in Afghanistan. I said, ‘Are we still going to war with Iraq?’ And he said,> ‘Oh, it’s worse than that.’ He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece> of paper. And he said, ‘I just got this down from upstairs’ — meaning the> Secretary of Defense’s office — ‘today.’ And he said, ‘This is a memo that> describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting> with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off,> Iran.’ I said, ‘Is it classified?’ He said, ‘Yes, sir.’ I said, ‘Well, don’t> show it to me.’ And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, ‘You remember> that?’ He said, ‘Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!’This exchange not only reveals the reason for 9/11 but also howcompartmentalised everything is with the Pentagon general having no idea whythey were proposing to invade all these countries. The pawns go very, very high.Clark also said that he was bewildered by what he was told and he was eitherlying about his surprise or, most likely, he was well out of the loop or innercircle of the Archon Death Cult even at his exalted level within the military. Ihave stressed over the years how compartmentalised the real agenda is even forthose who would appear to be ‘in the know’. People are given different reasonsto take or support actions that serve the overall agenda while having no ideathat there is an overall agenda. Military leaders wage war against countries onthe pretext of ‘fighting terrorism’ or ‘protecting civilians from tyranny’ whileoften having no clue whatsoever how they are being used. If we take Clark at hisword about not knowing the reason for the wish list of countries to invade after9/11 we have a perfect example of a general who was NATO’s Supreme AlliedCommander Europe who didn’t know that there is a globally-coordinated plan for afascist takeover that crucially requires to own and control the Middle and NearEast if it is to succeed. The list of countries that Clark mentioned, along withothers in the gun-sights, are connected to the plan to control and exploit theenormous landmass known as Eurasia which connects Europe to China and Russia tothe Middle East. The vital importance of Eurasia to global control wasemphasised by mega-insider Zbigniew Brzezinski in his 1997 book, The GrandChessboard. What he said explains so clearly the unfolding events in the Middleand Near East since the invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11:> Ever since the continents started interacting politically, some five hundred> years ago, Eurasia has been the center of world power ... it is imperative> that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of> also challenging America. The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated> Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book ...> ... In that context, how America ‘manages’ Eurasia is critical. A power that> dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and> economically productive regions. A mere glance at the map also suggests that> control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail Africa’s subordination,> rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania (Australia) geopolitically> peripheral to the world’s central continent ...> ... About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the> world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and> underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for about three–fourths of the world’s> known energy resources ...> ... The momentum of Asia’s economic development is already generating massive> pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and> the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain> reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of> Mexico, or the North Sea.Which country is central to control of the ‘Central Asian region and the CaspianSea basin? Iran. If you put Brzezinski’s views on Eurasia together with (a) theinvasion demands of the Project for the New American Century, (b) what Clarksaid that he was told in 2001, and (c) the attacks and invasions in the Middleand Near East since 9/11, it all makes perfect sense. Brzezinski said in his1997 book that ‘the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popularpassion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public’ssense of domestic well-being’. The ‘economic self-denial (that is, defensespending) and the human sacrifice (casualties, even among professional soldiers)required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts’, he wrote. Inother words, people in general don’t want war, death and destruction and so theyhave to be manipulated to accept it as a necessary evil in their own perceivedself-interest. Or, as the cold, callous and heartless Brzezinski put it:> Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society, it may> find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, except> in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external> threat.His words mirrored in theme those of the Rothschild Zionistcreated-and-controlled Project for the New American Century which said that ...‘[the] process of transformation ... is likely to be a long one, absent somecatastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor’. Four years beforeand one year before the attacks, Brzezinski and the Project for the New AmericanCentury were talking about the same thing ... 9/11. This was the catalyst forall that has followed both in terms of overseas wars and invasions and thedomestic demolition of basic rights and freedoms. What has happened inAfghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria and is planned to happen in Iran, Russia andChina is the playing out of the plan instigated on September 11th, 2001. Giventhis vital role of 9/11 in all that has followed, and given the warning byBrzezinski and the Project for the New American Century that none of it waslikely to happen without a perceived external threat like a ‘new Pearl Harbor’,is there anyone with even a modicum of brain-cell activity who can’t see that9/11 was staged by the very forces that would use it as the excuse to begin totick-off the countries on their must-have list? Yet the mainstream media,mainstream academia and much of the global population continues to be inchild-like denial of the patently bloody obvious.It was claimed that the intention was to leave Iraq when freedom had beensecured for the people and the same with Afghanistan, but I said at the timethat they had no intention of leaving and so it has proved. The plan involvestaking over these countries, not bombing them shitless and then moving out. TheUnited States is still running Iraq even though most of the troops may havegone, and outgoing Obama Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke in early 2013 ofcommitting to an ‘enduring presence’ in Afghanistan even after the missionofficially ended in 2014. This is the same deal as in Iraq. The UK Mail onSunday revealed in February 2013 that Britain’s Special Air Services (SAS) wereinvolved in fierce fighting inside Iraq the day before the vote in the House ofCommons on whether to invade in 2003 and while Tony Blair lied and lied andlied. The Archontic agenda doesn’t care about the views of politicians – it’sgoing to happen anyway unless the people stop it. The UK Guardian reported thatthe mendacious British Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote privately toleading members of the government urging them not to discuss the legality of theIraq invasion during the period of the tenth anniversary in 2013 – Haguerepresents the Conservative Party which officially opposes the Labour Party ofTony Blair who took Britain illegally and immorally into the duck-shoot ‘war’ inIraq. But they are really on the same side. The most obvious state murder of DrDavid Kelly, the British weapons inspector in Iraq who knew that they were lyingover Saddam’s ‘weapons of mass destruction’, has been covered up by bothpolitical parties and Kelly remains the only person in modern English legalhistory to be denied a proper inquest. Carne Ross, a British diplomat and friendof Kelly’s, said that he was told by a ‘very aggressive’ official that if hediscussed Kelly during testimony at the whitewash and cover-up Chilcot ‘inquiry’into the Iraq war, he would be silenced. The UK Daily Mail said it understoodthat the official who confronted Ross was Margaret Aldred, secretary of the Iraq‘Inquiry’ chaired by Sir John Chilcot. How ‘independent’. All the insiders fromBlair downwards and upwards know what really happened to Kelly. Lies andcover-up, lies and cover-up wherever you look. Governments claimed they did nothave troops on the ground in Libya or Syria but they were lying again. It’stheir job. Former French foreign minister Roland Dumas said on FrenchParliamentary TV that he was told by British officials that they were organisingan invasion of Syria by ‘rebels’ two years before the violence started. Theattacks of 9/11 were engineered by the American military and Intelligencenetwork in league with the Israeli (Rothschild) enforcement arm Mossad. Theywere a manufactured problem that led to a public reaction and the solution ofinvading countries on the Archon bloodline hit list, launching the fake ‘war onterror’ and deleting the most basic freedoms and rights to privacy in the nameof ‘fighting terrorism’. The official story of 9/11 is a very, very sick joke,so absurd are its claims and contradictions. This is always the case withProblem-Reaction-Solutions because PRS cover stories are, by definition, a packof lies (deception). It was obvious that what was going to happen was well knownin some circles. It turns out that there were a number of television dramas andmovies in production around the time of 9/11 with remarkable similarities towhat happened and some of the story lines were developed with support from themilitary and government agencies. An American television programme called TheLone Gunmen, a spin-off from the X-Files, was broadcast in March 2001 andfeatured an airliner remotely-controlled from the ground being flown towards theWorld Trade Center while the pilots fought to regain control (Fig 488). This wasonly one of many examples of what must have been preknowledge from somewhere orother (Figs 489 and 490). Some may have been coincidence but there are so manythat this cannot explain all of them. The Saturn worshipping bloodlines andnetworks were the real perpetrators of 9/11 and look at the memorial for thevictims that these same bloodlines had built on the site of the Twin Towers (Fig491). You could hardly see a more obvious temple to Saturn with its design andcolour. It is close to the subway station where I saw the large image of an eye(Saturn) broadcasting a frequency across the Earth. That whole area aroundGround Zero is like a temple to Saturn, the planet (sun) of death.[../Images/00336.jpg]Figure 488: The plane hijacked from the ground heads for the Twin Towers in TheLone Gunmen.[../Images/00320.jpg]Figure 489: Cards from the board game Illuminati before 9/11 – very prophetic.[../Images/00402.jpg]Figure 490: a pre-9/11The Simpsons.[../Images/00250.jpg]Figure 491: The Saturn symbolism of the 9/11 memorial at Ground Zero.[../Images/00082.jpg]Figures 492 and 493: Twin pillar or twin tower symbolism is central toFreemasonry and other secret societies.[../Images/00490.jpg]Figures 494: The twin towers of the World Trade Center were built on theinitiative of David Rockefeller and his brother,New York governor NelsonRockefeller..Twin Towers or ‘twin pillars’ = SaturnTwin towers are a major bloodline symbol and relate to the twin pillars orobelisks that were claimed to adorn the entrance of ‘Solomon’s Temple’ (Fig 492and 493). They are known in Freemasonry as the twin pillars of Joachim and Boazand you see them at Freemasonic temples, other locations with Freemasonicconnections and of course at the World Trade Center before the attacks (Fig494). You can also see the in-your-face Saturn symbolism in the twintower/pillar images inside the Mother Lodge of Freemasonry in Great Queen(Babylon goddess) Street in London. One has the six-pointed star of Saturnbetween the towers and the other even portrays Saturn’s luminous crescent andthe serpent Ouroboros or ‘Ring-Pass-Not’ (Figs 495 and 496). Twin towers arebuilt into major cathedrals like Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s in London, andNotre Dame in Paris. They adorn the Masjid al-Haram mosque in Mecca, home of theSaturn Kaaba. Solomon and his mythical temple represent Saturn and when you walkbetween the phallic twin pillars or towers you are entering a temple to Saturn.The Tower card in the Tarot is also a depiction of what happened on 9/11 andthat will not be a coincidence when you are dealing with the occultobsessedbloodlines (Fig 497). Key words connected to the Tower card are change;eruption; upheaval; exposure; cataclysm; blind-sided; sudden shift; fire,lightning and falling. The insider-job attacks of September 11th were a satanicr. death ritual involving 911, the number used for emergencies in the UnitedStates, and the twin towers of Freemasonry. They then established a memorial tothe dead that was obvious Saturn symbolism. I explain in Remember Who You Arehow the rituals are planned often decades and more in advance and the TwinTowers were built (thanks to Archon gofers David Rockefeller and his brother andNew York governor, Nelson Rockefeller) in the full knowledge of those in thedeep inner circle of what would happen to them in 2001. The same applies to thedepiction of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty placed on a satanic blackpentagram on top of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris where Princess Diana(named after the ancient goddess Diana) died almost exactly below where itstands (Fig 498). Pont de l’Alma means ‘bridge or passage of the moon goddess’and was apparently the location, then outside of the original Paris, where theMerovingian (Archon-hybrid) kings performed their sacrifice rituals to thegoddess Diana. She had to be killed in the tunnel according to their ritual andthat is why it took them so outrageously long to get her to hospital and whythey gave the public a cover story about trying to save an already dead Dianawhen she did arrive. The Pont de l’Alma flame and pentagram is now the placewhere people take their tributes to Diana and the ‘official memorial’ in Paris(a single plaque outside a garden that one local councillor called a ‘vegetableplot’) was so pathetic and so located to ensure that the flame on top of thetunnel remained the focus. Energy flows where attention goes. The flame wasplaced on the tunnel in the 1980s at the behest, and with the funding, of TheInternational Herald Tribune which was then jointly-owned by the Ochs–Sulzbergerfamily (Rothschild Zionists), owners of The New York Times, and the Meyer–Grahamfamily (Rothschild Zionists), owners of The Washington Post.[../Images/00141.jpg]Figures 495: Saturn between the twin pillars in the Mother Lodge of Freemasonryin London along with George and the dragon.[../Images/00217.jpg]Figures 496: Saturn and luminous crescent between twin towers with theOuroboros.[../Images/00176.jpg]Figures 497: The tower card in the Tarot.[../Images/00205.jpg]Figure 498: The ‘liberty’ (inversion) flame standing on a black pentagram abovethe tunnel where Princess Diana died.Both world wars were engineered Problem-Reaction-Solutions to change the face ofhuman society and centralise global power like never before (see ... And TheTruth Shall Set You Free) and so were the fake ‘shoe bomber’ and ‘underpantsbomber’ terrorist ‘scares’ that have been used to increase airport security toinsane levels which include a cumulatively lethal dose of radiation in full bodyscanners. Passengers on the plane with the ‘underpants bomber’ have describedhow they saw him escorted through security and onto the aircraft without apassport. There is even a version of Problem-Reaction-Solution that I callNo-Problem-Reaction-Solution in which you don’t need a real problem – just thepublic perception of one to justify your actions. The non-existent ‘weapons ofmass destruction’ in Iraq and ‘human-caused climate change’ are but two examplesof this and another is the ‘second death’ of Osama bin Laden who actually diedin 2001, not 2011 (see Remember Who You Are). I will address the ‘climatechange’ mega-scam a little later. Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief ofstaff to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, has said that the Bushadministration knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq while theywere telling the world that there were. He said on American television thatPowell had said to him before the invasion: ‘I wonder what will happen when weput 500,000 troops into Iraq and comb the country from one end to the other andfind nothing.’ This was the same Colin Powell that made a now infamouspresentation at the United Nations to make the case for the invasion on thegrounds that Saddam clearly had WMD. These people have no shame. Anotherextraordinary No-Problem-Reaction-Solution, as already mentioned, is the way theFBI sets up patsies with bomb plots, devices and vehicles and then steps in atthe last moment to say ‘we stopped another terrorist plot against America’. Thishas triggered bizarre headlines like ‘FBI Plot to Blow Up Bank in Oakland –Stopped by FBI’ and ‘FBI celebrates duping another mentally ill man with faketerror plot’. The fingerprints of the FBI were all over the Boston Marathonbombings in 2013 (see postscript).The ‘TT’The Totalitarian Tiptoe is the bedfellow or stable mate ofProblem-Reaction-Solution and so often they come as a pair. The ‘TT’ is thetechnique of reaching Archontic goals by stepping-stones, each of which ispromoted as unconnected to all the others until you look back eventually and seewhere the sum total of the ‘stones’ has taken you. At the very start of theTiptoe process the Archon bloodlines know the direction they want the world togo, but they are also aware that if the steps are too big then the change willbe such that people might look up from the game show or football match and askwhat is going on. So they advance in steps which they think they can get awaywith, but not so big that they alert too many people to what they are doing.There can be few more obvious Totalitarian Tiptoes than the European Union and Iwill use this as a perfect example of how the technique works. We have seen boththis and Problem-Reaction-Solution to the fore in the more than 60 years that ithas taken to transform a ‘free trade area’ into a centrally-dictatedbureaucratic superstate which is now crossing the border into fascism orcommunism – take your pick because they are both the same totalitarian controlunder different names. The plan has been from its very inception to make theEuropean Union what it is today – and then some; but the Hidden Hand has had tokeep this very quiet until it reaches the point where there is no going back. Weare looking that moment in the face now with proposals for still furthercentralisation of power that will delete what is left (and it’s not much) ofnational sovereignty within the EU. This is right in line with the need for theArchontic few to constantly centralise power to ever-increase their control ofthe global masses. The plan for a centrallycontrolled fascist/communist UnitedStates of Europe goes back centuries and this was on the wish-list of theKnights Templar long before the public ever heard of it. The leading playerbehind the imposition of the European Union has been (reels back in shock) theHouse of Rothschild and the secret society that I call Rothschild Zionism. Oneof their pump-primer frontmen was Count Richard N Coudenhove-Kalergi, anAustrian politician, who wrote a book in 1923 called Pan-Europa. The titlebrings together Pan, the horned goat-god (Saturn) of Satanism, and Europa,another name for the goddess of Babylon and the reason the continent is calledEurope. I know the ‘Pan’ bit might sound far-fetched, but not for those who havestudied the unbelievably fine-detail in which Archontic agents place theirsymbolic words, names and phrases everywhere. The EU is the Union of the Goddessand this is why there are twelve pentagrams stars in a circle on the EU flag(Fig 499). This is a symbol of the goddess and the reason that ‘Mother Mary’,another version of ancient goddess symbolism, is often portrayed with twelvestars around her head. The Book of Revelation also says: ‘And there appeared agreat wonder in Heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under herfeet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.’ Archbishop Montini of Milan(later Pope Pius XII) called Mary ‘Our Beloved Lady, Ruler of Europe’ – Europa.You have a bull image outside the European Parliament and on commemorative coinsminted by the EU because Europa, the Babylonian Semiramis/Ishtar, is said tohave ridden on the back of a bull which is Nimrod, god of the Saturn sun (Figs500 and 501). The story was also told about the Greek god, Zeus. The bullappears on all EU residence permits and outside a number of EU institutions. Inother words, the Babylonian god does.[../Images/00100.jpg]Figure 499: Symbol of the goddess on the EU flag.[../Images/00410.jpg]Figure 500: Europa and bull-god.[../Images/00127.jpg]Figure 501: The same theme on an EU coin.The EU tiptoesCount Richard N Coudenhove-Kalergi’s book envisaged what is now the EuropeanUnion and he went on to cofound the Pan-European Union in league with theRothschilds and the Archon Habsburgs who ruled the Holy Roman Empire (ArchonEmpire) in Europe for centuries. Otto von Habsburg later became President of thePan-European Union with its cross and circle of the Saturn sun (Fig 502). Notethe name right from the start, European Union. This was more than 60 yearsbefore the term was used for today’s EU superstate. The Count’s father was aclose friend of Theodor Herzl; the Rothschild puppet who is officially creditedwith being the founder of Rothschild Zionism, and among the Count’s majorfunders for the European project was Rothschild Zionist and Rothschildsubordinate, Max Warburg. The Count says in his autobiography:[../Images/00199.jpg]Figure 502: TThe Pan-European Union.> At the beginning of 1924, we received a call from Baron Louis de Rothschild;> one of his friends, Max Warburg, from Hamburg, had read my book and wanted to> get to know us. To my great surprise, Warburg spontaneously offered us 60,000> gold marks [imagine what that would be today] to tide the movement over for> its first three years ... Max Warburg, who was one of the most distinguished> and wisest men that I have ever come into contact with, had a principle of> financing these movements. He remained sincerely interested in Pan-Europe for> his entire life.Well, of course he did. It was a vital element in the Archon agenda for globalcontrol. Rothschild Zionist Max Warburg went on to become a banker to Hitlerbefore he left for America in 1938 and he was a director of IG Farben, theRothschild creation that brought Hitler to power and ran the concentration campat Auschwitz. How ‘distinguished and wise’ Warburg must have been. His brother,Paul Warburg (Rothschild Zionist), was the driving force in the founding of thecatastrophic (for the people) US Federal Reserve in 1913 which hijacked theAmerican economy for the Rothschilds and is today gobbling up the entrails. MaxWarburg was an acknowledged funder of Rothschild Zionist Vladimir Lenin and theRussian Revolution on behalf of the Rothschilds and Paul Warburg was a partnerin Kuhn, Loeb and Company, the Rothschild investment bank in New York, which wasa major funder of Lenin (Rothschild Zionist) and Trotsky (Rothschild Zionist)and the ‘revolution’ that created the Soviet Union. The head of Kuhn, Loeb atthe time was Jacob Schiff (Rothschild Zionist), whose family once lived in thesame house as the Rothschilds in Frankfurt. Rothschild agents were behind thepush to create another Soviet Union called the European Union. The Rothschildsare absolutely everywhere in the story of the EU, as with so much else. CountCoudenhove-Kalergi’s co-founder of the Pan-European Union was a PolishJesuit-trained priest, Joseph Retinger, who just happened to be at the forefrontin the creation of the Rothschild Bilderberg Group which has been a guidinglight in the Common Market, now the EU, ever since. George McGhee, a USambassador to West Germany and Bilderberg attendee, said: ‘The Treaty of Rome,which brought the Common Market into being, was nurtured at Bilderbergmeetings’. So was the establishment of the euro single currency according toBilderberg chairman, Viscount Etienne Davignon, a close friend of currentPresident of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy (Bilderberg Group). Thefirst chairman of the Bilderberg Group, officially launched at the BilderbergHotel in the Netherlands in 1954, was Prince Bernhard, a German aristocrat andmember of Hitler’s SS who married into the Dutch Royal family. Bernhard was aclose friend of Prince Philip – both with Nazi sympathies and supporters ofeugenics – and together they established the World Wildlife Fund, now the WorldWide Fund for Nature, to exploit environmental concerns to advance the Archonticglobal design. The fake ‘human-caused global warming’ and ‘climate change’ arecentral to that. Their fellow founder of the WWF was leading eugenicist JulianHuxley, brother of Brave New World author, Aldous Huxley. Prince Bernard andJoseph Retinger first publicly suggested regular meetings of European foreignministers (tiptoe) and out of this came the customs union (tiptoe) which wasknown as the Benelux Countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg). Bilderbergfounder Retinger then announced his vision of a Europe in which countries would‘relinquish part of their sovereignty’. He made his proposals in a speech at theLondon-based Royal Institute of International Affairs, one of the satelliteorganisations, along with the Bilderberg Group, in the network of the RoundTable secret society headquartered in Britain. Other satellites include theCouncil on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. Next on the scenewas Jean Monnet, a friend and associate of Retinger, and both of them answeredto the Rothschilds. Monnet would go on to be called ‘the Father of Europe’ forhis work on the ‘European Project’ (Fig 503). He described the plan from thestart in a letter to a friend on April 30th, 1952:[../Images/00415.jpg]Figure 503: Jean Monnet, the ‘Father of Europe’ (Rothschild gofer).[../Images/00297.jpg]Figure 504: The EU is a monster designed from the start to destroy freedom inEurope.> Europe’s nations should be guided towards the super-state without their people> understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps,> each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and> irreversibly lead to federation.And it is still going on today (Fig 504). Monnet was instrumental with Frenchpolitician and later Prime Minister Robert Schuman in the establishment in 1952of the European Coal and Steel Community (tiptoe) which merged andcentrally-controlled the coal and steel industries of West Germany, France,Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg. Monnet was awarded the WatelerPeace Prize (pay-off) of two million francs to recognise the ‘internationalspirit which he had shown in conceiving the Coal and Steel Community’. The awardwas made by the Rothschild-controlled Carnegie Foundation. Merry and SergeBromberger, both admirers of Monnet, described the covert plan in their book,Jean Monnet and the United States of Europe:> Gradually, it was thought, the supranational authorities, supervised by the> European Council of Ministers at Brussels and the Assembly in Strasbourg,> would administer all the activities of the Continent. A day would come when> governments would be forced to admit that an integrated Europe was an> accomplished fact, without their having had a say in the establishment of its> underlying principles.> All they would have to do was to merge all these autonomous institutions into> a single federal administration and then proclaim a United States of Europe.Look at where we are today and it’s all been planned from day one. The momentumquickened when the six members of the Coal and Steel Community signed the two‘Treaties of Rome’ in 1957 to create the European Economic Community (EEC), or‘Common Market’, along with Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community(tiptoe). The Common Market was promoted only as a free-trade zone that would begood for jobs and the economy. As Monnet had said ... ‘This can be accomplishedby successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but whichwill eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.’ Support for all this wascoming from the Rothschild branch in the United States especially during thenegotiations over the Treaty of Rome which created the Common Market. This wasconfirmed by Harvard lecturer, Ernst H van der Beugel, an honorarysecretary-general of the Bilderberg Group, in his book, From Marshall Aid toAtlantic Partnership (foreword by his friend, Henry Kissinger). He wrote:> Monnet and his action committee were unofficially supervising the negotiations> and as soon as obstacles appeared, the United States diplomatic machinery was> alerted, mostly through Ambassador Bruce ... who had immediate access to the> top echelon of the State Department ...> ... At that time, it was usual that if Monnet thought that a particular> country made difficulties in the negotiations, the American diplomatic> representative in that country approached the Foreign Ministry in order to> communicate the opinion of the American Government which, in practically all> cases, coincided with Monnet’s point of view [the Rothschild view].Richard N Gardner of the Council on Foreign Relations was later to say that theplan was to ‘erode it [sovereignty] piece by piece’. But, don’t worry; there’sno conspiracy.Black eyes is backBritain joined the ‘Common Market’ in 1973 thanks to Conservative Party PrimeMinister Edward ‘black eyes’ Heath, the practising Satanist, paedophile, andserial child-killer and torturer under the complete control, because of all ofthese things and more, of Lord Victor Rothschild. Heath (Bilderberg Group) hadbeen Britain’s most prominent and vocal political advocate of Britain’s entryand he completed the job as Prime Minister. Victor Rothschild was also thestrings-holder for Heath’s ‘opponent’ at the time, the Labour Party leader,Harold Wilson (Bilderberg Group). Heath was secretly agreeing to Britain’spolitical union with Europe as early as 1962 when he was Lord Privy Seal in theConservative government of Harold Macmillan. According to official documents,Heath told the Ministerial Council of the Western European Union: ‘... you havedecided that those who join the Economic Communities as full members must alsojoin the Political Union. I am sure that this was the right decision.’Meanwhile, Heath and other British politicians were saying that the CommonMarket was only a free trade area with no plans for political union. Heath‘negotiated’ British entry with French President Georges Pompidou (BilderbergGroup), a former employee of the Rothschilds, and he agreed to run down anddestroy a list of British industries. The plan from the beginning was to createa centrally-controlled Europe, bring an end to nation states and have theregions of the new Europe designated certain economic and industrialspecialisations. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty on European Union even uses the word‘municipal’ elections when it talks of national elections within Europe, but theplan is to end all national elections by ending nations themselves. Breakingnation states into regions is designed to de-unify any potential response to theEU dictatorship and many separatist movements are being covertly supported byArchon interests to bring about the end of the nation state. ‘Independence’might sound good – as with Scotland and demands for independence from the UK –but they are turkeys voting for Christmas if they go ahead with it in thecurrent circumstances. I am all for devolution of power from the centre, butthat is not what this is all about. The idea is to create minnow regions andthen have them for breakfast. The secret EU plan for regional specialisationmeant that industries not connected to a country’s designated role had to bedeleted by stealth. John Davies, Heath’s Secretary of State for Industry, toldthe Conservative Party’s ‘Monday Club’ group that it had been agreed to run downBritain’s manufacturing industry and for this London would become the moneymarket of Europe. He never bothered to tell the public, though. Heath alsoconceded British sovereignty of its territorial fishing waters and the EU CommonFisheries Policy has devastated the British fishing industry in an islandnation. Cabinet papers released in 2001 reveal that the government and civilservants agreed to hide what had been agreed: ‘[Ministers believed] ... it vitalnot to get drawn into an explanation of what was going on or to admit what adisaster was in store for Britain’s fishermen [who] in the wider context must beregarded as expendable.’ While this was happening, Heath wrote: ‘The Governmentis determined to secure proper safeguards for the British fishing industry.’Geoffrey Rippon, who was part of Heath’s negotiating team, told the House ofCommons: ‘We retain full jurisdiction over our coastal waters.’ Britain may besurrounded by the sea, but the fishing industry has been all but destroyed byHeath’s agreements and EU fishing quotas specifically designed to make full-timefishing financially impossible. Sir Crispin Tickle, another of Heath’snegotiators, has admitted that the Government covered up the full implicationsof membership and he said that the rule was ‘Don’t talk about this in public’.They were all lying from the start, but then that is what Archons do – lie anddeceive. Witness Archon deceivers and inverters Blair, Cameron, Bush, Obama, theClintons, ad infinitum. Heath was asked in a BBC interview decades later if hehad known all along that Britain was signing up to a federal European state. Hereplied: ‘Of course, yes.’Edward Heath took on the coal miners in 1972 and 1974 in pursuit of the Europeanagenda when they went on strike over low pay. Coal stocks declined to the pointwhere Heath introduced a three-day working week and lost the next election toanother Victor Rothschild asset, the Labour leader Harold Wilson. The plan wasto destroy the coal industry as per the European Blueprint along with the tradeunion movement which for all its faults brought together large numbers of peoplein common cause and blocked full-blown divide and rule. The original LabourParty was created by the trade unions in 1900 and was still heavily funded bythem at the time of Harold Wilson and his successor as Prime Minister, JamesCallaghan. If the trade unions were going to be targeted openly it could only bedone by the anti-union Conservative Party which was now led in opposition byMargaret Thatcher who took over as leader from Heath in 1975. Thatcher appointedher friend Lord Victor Rothschild as her ‘security advisor’ and she wascarefully selected on the grounds of personality, ease of manipulation andalmost certainly bloodline (a strong frequency connection to the Archons). Herpersonality and approach to life were classically Archontic and honed by herfather, a shopkeeper and local politician in Grantham. He was also a Christianpreacher and brought up his daughter as a strict Methodist. This definition of aMethodist describes Margaret Thatcher very well: ‘One who is characterised bystrict adherence to method; one who thinks or acts according to a fixed systemor definite principles; one who is thoroughly versed in method.’ Or, as aCanadian journalist told me after an interview with her: ‘She’s barelyone-dimensional’. British manufacturing and steel-making collapsed and Thatcher,with characteristic coldness, set about destroying the coal industry. She hadlearned from the experience of Heath and his three-day working week when coalstocks ran low during the strikes of the 1970s. Thatcher gave the minersfinancial incentives to produce as much coal as possible until coal reserveswere overflowing and then she began to announce the closure of pits. The minerswent on strike in protest, but they had produced too much coal for strikes toimpact on the economy and they marched back to work in the face of hunger anddestitution after a year without wages. The coal industry, like the steelindustry, was dead and the trade unions had suffered a blow from which they havenever recovered. How interesting that Thatcher’s reputation was to be vehementlyopposed to the increasing power of the Rothschild European Community but herpolicies brought about the very changes to which Edward Heath had agreed when henegotiated entry – that is the dismantling of Britain’s industrial andmanufacturing base in favour of finance and ‘service industries’. Manufacturingaccounted for about 26 percent of UK economic output when Thatcher came to powerin 1979, but by 2011 it was just 10.8 percent. I don’t doubt that her oppositionto increasing European Community power was very genuine, but she was easy tomanipulate because she did not understand the forces at work around her or puttwo and two together. To Thatcher, there was the issue of the British economyand the issue of losing sovereignty to Europe – when these were fundamentallyconnected. Thatcher did exactly what was required with her financialfree-for-all, too. Her so-called ‘Big Bang’ deregulation of the City of Londonfinancial centre opened the door to parasites like Rothschild-controlled GoldmanSachs and a global economic system. One financial commentator said of theoutcome of the Thatcher ‘Big Bang’: ‘In 25 years, the UK’s trade surplus infinancial services increased two-and-a-half fold, and there is now no crediblerival in Europe for the City’s position.’ The London Times said when Thatcherdied in 2013: ‘Big Bang was a hugely significant reform that cemented the Cityof London’s place as Europe’s biggest financial centre.’ What was it that Heathagreed to do again when negotiating Britain’s entry into the EEC? To rundownBritain’s manufacturing base and focus on banking and other financial servicesas the UK’s specialisation within a European superstate. Heath’s Secretary ofState for Industry, John Davies, said decades earlier that they had agreed todismantle Britain’s manufacturing industry and for London to become the moneymarket of Europe. Mission accomplished – thanks to ‘anti-Europe’ Thatcher. Thisis how it all works – different rhetoric, but the same outcome.Neo-Nazis make Hitler’s dream come trueThe Single European Act (tiptoe), which brought down trade barriers acrossEurope, and the Maastricht Accords for European Union (tiptoe) fundamentallyeroded national sovereignty. ‘Economic’ was dropped from the name and it becamethe European Community (tiptoe) before that was replaced with European Union(tiptoe). This was followed by the creation of a European Central Bank (tiptoe)and single European currency (tiptoe). The concept of Europe with centralisedcontrol administered by a European Central Bank, single currency, regionaladministration and common labour, transport and industrial policies is exactlywhat Hitler and the Nazis planned for Europe. They even called their plan theEuropean Economic Community (Europäische Wirtschaft = gemeinschaft). The policyhas been to lie to the public of Europe decade after decade until everything wasin place to make the situation irretrievable. On the few occasions that publicreferendums voted to block further centralisation of power they simply ignoredthem or forced another vote and a different result. Once they got the decisionthey wanted there were no more referendums. When the French and Dutch votedagainst a proposed European Constitution by a margin that would likely not beoverturned by another vote, the bureaucrats simply changed the name fromEuropean Constitution to Lisbon Treaty while retaining 98 percent of theConstitution in the Treaty. They then said that as the French and Dutch ‘no’votes had been for the Constitution they were now invalid because theConstitution had become a Treaty. The Irish constitution (RIP) presented aproblem because it insisted on a referendum for constitutional changes of thescale demanded by the Lisbon Treaty. But when the Irish voted against theTreaty, which required a ‘yes’ from all member states, the moronic andindescribably pathetic Irish Prime Minister, Brian Cowen, who was never electedby a public vote, was ordered by his masters to have a second vote and somehowthey reversed the decision. Soon afterwards the Irish economy collapsed and nowIreland is pretty much owned by the European Central Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) – both pseudonyms for the Rothschilds. The Lisbon Treaty,which came into force in 2009, gave so much power to the bureaucratic centre,including the new post of President of the European Council, that the speed ofcentralisation and erosion of sovereignty across the whole range of publicpolicy entered a whole new phase. The more you centralise power the more poweryou have at the centre to centralise even quicker. The engineered economicimplosion of Greece followed by Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain has created amassive problem in search of a solution and what is now being proposed by theEU’s President Herman van Rompuy is to delete what is left of nationalsovereignty to ‘fix’ the problems that they created. It is aProblem-Reaction-Solution leading to another giant step on the TotalitarianTiptoe which has now become a sprint as society is locked down. The euro, the EUsingle currency, was never meant to be an end in itself. The plan is for asingle global electronic currency as I have been saying for nearly two decades.The euro was simply a stalking horse to delete all the individual currenciesthat existed before – the mark, guilder, lira and so on. The plan is to trashthe euro eventually and move to a global currency with all the implications forglobal control. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the dynasty said, and ason would repeat: ‘Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makesits laws.’ Change the word ‘nation’ to ‘world’ in the event a global currency.Archon network asset Herman van Rompuy, or ‘Rumpy Pumpy’ as he is widely known,the de-facto president of the EU, makes my spine chill whenever I see him. Heusually has his fellow purveyor of heartless arrogance in tow, José ManuelBarroso, the appointed head of the European Commission bureaucracy. They areboth exploiting the manufactured euro crisis as the excuse (just as Monnet said)to draft new proposals for further EU centralisation and integration in concertwith two other Rothschild placemen, Mario Draghi, President of the EuropeanCentral Bank, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the 17-country Eurogroup.The fact that this ‘gang of four’ are behind the plans for still furthercentralisation is no surprise at all:> • Rompuy became president of the European Council with the specific job of> overseeing the political and financial integration of the EU.> • Mario Draghi is a former vice chairman and managing director of the> Rothschild Zionist Goldman Sachs International which was in the frontline of> crashing the Greek economy.> • José Manuel Barroso is the professional arrogant administering the European> Project from the centre as bureaucrat-in-chief of the EU Commission.> • Jean-Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxemburg, was a prime architect> of the sovereignty-deleting Maastricht Treaty.In other words, they are all big-time insiders following a script authored inthe shadows. Their seven-page document, leaked to the UK Guardian, called forswift moves to establish banking union, followed by full economic and politicalunion to meet the challenges of the economic crisis – or as Jean Monnet put itin 1952: ‘This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as havingan economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead tofederation.’ Then, in September 2012, EU Commission chief, the truly appallingBarroso, announced what I had been predicting since 1993 – the demand for a‘federation of nation states’ run from Brussels in which national governmentswould ‘share sovereignty’ and give ‘absolute loyalty’ to the Brusselsbureaucrats. He said that this was the only solution to the debt crisis (whichhas been systematically created). Barroso promised there would be another treatyto bring about ‘deep and genuine economic and monetary union, a political union,with a coherent foreign and defence policy’. He told the European Parliament inhis ‘State of the Union’ address:> We are in a defining moment. This moment requires decisions and leadership. In> Europe, this means accepting we are all in the same boat. It means recognising> the commonality of our interests. And it means demanding a true sense of> common responsibility. Because when you are on a boat in the middle of the> storm, absolute loyalty is the minimum you demand from your fellow crew> members. I call for a federation of nation states.Problem-Reaction-Solution and the Totalitarian Tiptoe usually work as oneseamless unit and here we see this once again. We have already reached the pointwhere closing in on 80 percent of laws and regulations imposed in Britainoriginate with the unelected European Commission which is no different from thePolitburo in the Soviet Union – as dissidents from the communist era havestated. The London Daily Mail quoted Steve Hilton, a former director of strategyfor Prime Minister David Cameron, as saying that such was the EU’s power overnation states that Cameron only knew about many of the policy decisions made inhis Government’s name when he heard them reported by the media. Hilton said thatthe Prime Minister was frequently left out of the loop as important policydecisions were pushed through by ‘paper-shuffling mandarins’. Hilton alsoestimated that as much as 40 percent of the work of government civil servantsand administrators was in implementing direct orders from Brussels bureaucratswhich bypassed elected politicians in Parliament.The EUSSRThe West said that the Soviet Union was so bad that they had to instigate a ColdWar with fantastic increases in nuclear weapons to protect ‘freedom’. Thecommunist state absorbed 15 countries with an estimated total population of 293million (Fig 505). The European Union has absorbed 27 countries, with more dueto join, with a population so far of more than 500 million (Fig 506). The EU isthe Soviet Union under another name and seeks to hide its bureaucraticdictatorship behind a ‘European Parliament’ when the real power is with thebureaucrats. They have located the ‘parliament’ in Strasbourg, France, away fromthe true power centre in Brussels, Belgium, where the Commission is based andheaded by the not publiclyelected Barroso, who says that nation states aredangerous because they are excessively democratic – ‘Decisions taken by the mostdemocratic institutions in the world are very often wrong.’ Barroso said thiswhile standing at the centre of one of the most infamously corrupt andincompetent bureaucracies on Earth. Well, it is if you think it’s there to workin the best interests of the people. It is pure genius if you know thatenslaving the people is really the case. The unelected Commission proposeslegislation through the president and a cabinet of unelected commissioners and,in theory, a combination of the parliament and the Council of the EuropeanUnion, or ‘Consilium’ (a minister from each member state) decide if they willaccept it or not (Fig 507). In truth, the whole process is so stitched up thatthe Commission gets virtually what it wants. It has all been stitched up fromday one. Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party and co-chair ofthe Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European Parliament, has becomewell-known for his rants at the podium against EU incompetence and its obsessionwith centralisation of power. They are great to watch and he makes some goodpoints, but either he can’t see the big picture or chooses not to mention it.This is the blatant fact that it is not incompetence that has brought the EU toits economic knees and imposed economic policies that involve countries facingcatastrophe still having to contribute to bail-out funds for other countriesfacing catastrophe. If the problem was only incompetence the task would be farmore straightforward and focussed on replacing the incompetent with thecompetent. But it’s not like that. They are very competent at following anagenda of calculated incompetence with the aim of creating an enormous problemin search of a solution. They are quite okay with being branded as incompetentbecause this covers their cold calculation. Vladimir Bukovksy, a former Sovietdissident, said years ago that in 1992 he had seen secret Politburo and CentralCommittee documents about the European Union which confirmed the reality of a‘conspiracy’ to turn Europe into a ‘totalitarian state’. Bukovksy described theEU as a ‘monster’. He said the document that he saw revealed that a delegationfrom the Trilateral Commission, another Round Table satellite, met with SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev in January 1989. The delegation consisted of arch(Archontic) manipulators David Rockefeller (Bilderberg Group), Henry Kissinger(Bilderberg Group) and former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing(Bilderberg Group). The conversation was about the GATT ‘free trade’ agreement(now the World Trade Organisation, or WTO), the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and the World Bank; but then Giscard d’Estaing intervened. He toldGorbachev a year before the Soviet Union fell:[../Images/00535.jpg]Figure 505: The Soviet Union.[../Images/00071.jpg]Figure 506: The European Union - Croatia also crazily joined on July 1st 2013[../Images/00356.jpg]Figure 507: TThe eye symbol of the EU Council of Ministers.> Mr President, I cannot tell you exactly when it will happen – probably within> 15 years – but Europe is going to be a federal state and you have to prepare> yourself for that. You have to work out with us, and the European leaders, how> you would react to that, how would you allow the other East European countries> to interact with it or how to become a part of it, you have to be prepared.’Three years later the Maastricht Treaty turned the European Community into theEuropean Union and the European Constitution that was quickly renamed the LisbonTreaty in the face of public opposition was drafted by ... Valéry Giscardd’Estaing. Had it not been for the ‘no’ votes by France and the Netherlands,Giscard d’Estaing’s Constitution would have made Europe a ‘federal state’ some17 years after he predicted ‘probably within 15’ to Gorbachev. Former Sovietdissident Anatoliy Golitsyn said that the European Parliament reminded him ofthe Supreme Soviet that was designed to look ‘supreme’ when the control wasreally in the hands of the bureaucrats at the Politburo. ‘When you look at thetidal wave of EU corruption it mirrors Soviet corruption by going from the topto the bottom rather than the bottom to the top.’ Golitsyn went on:> If you go through all the structures and features of this emerging European> monster you will notice that it more and more resembles the Soviet Union ...> It has no KGB – not yet – but I am very carefully watching such structures as> Europol for example. That really worries me a lot because this organisation> will probably have powers bigger than those of the KGB. They will have> diplomatic immunity. Can you imagine a KGB with diplomatic immunity?> They will have to police us on 32 kinds of crimes – two of which are> particularly worrying, one is called racism, another is called xenophobia ...> So it is a new crime, and we have already been warned. Someone from the> British government told us that those who object to uncontrolled immigration> from the Third World will be regarded as racist and those who oppose further> European integration will be regarded as xenophobes.Europol is not only expanding into the EU version of the KGB, but there are alsoongoing talks to fuse this organisation with US law enforcement through stillanother Archontic front on the road to global control, the Transatlantic Tradeand Investment Partnership. Keep an eye on the Atlas Network, too. This is agrouping of ‘special police units’ of the EU states to improve the ‘fightagainst terrorism’ and it is a stepping-stone to a European Homeland Security.Another of endless examples of the Totalitarian Tiptoe to a European Union KGBand pan-European police force can be seen with EU demands for the details of allBritain’s drivers to be made available to 27 police forces across Europe. TheBritish government is threatened with big fines by the EU for not complying withthis bureaucratic dictate. This alone shows how much power has now beentransferred from national state to unelected Brussels dark suits. The EU alsowants open access to Britain’s DNA database and fingerprint records and controlof all courts in every country of its ever-expanding empire along with controlof all police forces and military via central commands. It is Orwell’s nightmarebeing set before us and the same is planned in North America, Australia and NewZealand, and throughout the world as more ‘unions’ are evolved from ‘free-tradezones’, as per the EU blueprint – see the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC) and their like. They are planned to become politicaland economic unions answering to a world government and central bank. You aregoing to see more and more financial, trade and other agreements between thesezones, too, as the global system is put in place. In fact, this is alreadyhappening, with the EU and the US in ‘talks’ to create a ‘free-trade zone’ (itsays here) between the world’s biggest economies and the Trans-PacificPartnership (TPP) involving the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. These‘trade’ zones, like all the others, have the power to override national laws.Unelected European Commission President Jose Barroso said: ‘A future dealbetween the world’s two most important economic powers will be a game-changer,giving a strong boost to our economies on both sides of the Atlantic.’ Leave itout, mate. It is not about boosting the economy, it’s about still morecentralisation of power with the ‘free-trade’ used to justify standardisation oflaws, regulations, economics, law enforcement and military in precisely the sameway that it has happened in the EU already as a major step to a worldgovernment, army and all the rest. What liars these people are but then asArchons that is all they know.The coincidence theoristsFor those who still cannot see a conspiracy, no matter how in your face it maybe, I ask them this: Are we really saying that all these people who have workedcovertly to lie and plot for more than 90 years to impose the European Union wesee today have all been acting independently? Were all these people that I havementioned all working independently in their determination to secure throughlies and deceit the deletion of national and local sovereignty in every country?There has been no coordinating force since the 1920s connecting Count Richard NCoudenhove-Kalergi, Baron Louis de Rothschild, Max Warburg, Joseph Retinger,Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, Ted Heath, Geoffrey Rippon, Sir Crispin Tickle,Herman van Rompuy, Mario Draghi, José Manuel Barroso and Jean-Claude Juncker?And these are only a fraction of the people involved centrally and in everycountry decade after decade that have been necessary to get us where we are. Themainstream media in those countries have largely been on board, too, inpromoting the expansion of power within the EU – not least thebought-andpaid-for BBC. How many multiple thousands of politicians andadministrators have had to make the ‘right’ decisions with regard to the EU toget us to this point? And why would they do that when they were here today, gonetomorrow people, most of whom are long gone? Why, in the name of sanity, wouldcountries like Croatia still join the European Union even in the face of what isgoing on? It is like looking at a blazing building and asking when you can movein. Why? Because there is a coordinating force in the shadows for whom thesepeople are here today, gone tomorrow agents and gofers who do what they do formoney, for the illusion of power that it gives them, and, often, out of fear ofwhat will come out if they don’t take orders (see paedophilia and murder). Thearrogance of ignorance constantly dismisses and ridicules as ‘conspiracytheorists’ people with the foresight and guts to investigate the truth, but hownaïve and selfdenying do you have to be to look at the evidence and still be acoincidence theorist? Anyone who looks at the story of the European Union andstill denies a conspiracy is truly a lost cause. You see the Totalitarian Tiptoeat every turn. Symbolism is a powerful language that can say so much and howappropriate that the former headquarters of the Conservative Party at 32 SmithSquare near the Houses of Parliament is now the London headquarters of theEuropean Commission.The EU stitch-upDaniel Hannan, a British member of the European Parliament for more than 13years, is well placed to demolish the democratic window dressing of the EuropeanUnion. He said that the plain fact was that the EU is contemptuous of publicopinion and not by some oversight, ‘but as an inevitable consequence of itssupra-national nature’. He said that the EU was run, extraordinarily, by a bodythat combines legislative and executive power: ‘The European Commission is notonly the EU’s “government”, it is also the only body that can proposelegislation in most fields of policy.’ Such a concentration of power was itselfobjectionable enough, Hannan said, ‘but what is even more terrifying is that the27 Commissioners are unelected’. Many supporters of the EU acknowledged thisflaw, or ‘democratic deficit’, Hannan wrote in the London Daily Mail, andvaguely admitted that something ought to be done about it. ‘But the democraticdeficit isn’t an accidental design flaw: it is intrinsic to the whole project.’Exactly. Hannan said that the EU’s founding fathers had mixed feelings aboutdemocracy and prided themselves on creating a model where supreme power would bein the hands of ‘experts’– disinterested technocrats immune to the ballot box.‘They understood very well that their audacious scheme to merge Europe’s ancientkingdoms and republics into a single state would never succeed if eachsuccessive transfer of power from the national capitals to Brussels had to beapproved by the voters.’ They were unapologetic about designing a system inwhich public opinion would come second to deals stuck by a bureau of wise men, asituation that continues today. Hannan wrote: ‘When referendums go the “wrong”way, Eurocrats simply swat the results aside ... the first rule is “noreferendums – unless we can fix the result”.’ Hannan highlighted the statementby the then Prime Minister Tony Blair, another Archontic place-man puppet, whosaid: ‘The British people are sensible enough to know that, even if they have acertain prejudice about Europe, they don’t expect their government necessarilyto share it or act upon it.’ Hannan went on:> Taxpayers in all the states contribute money to Brussels through their> national taxes. The bureaucrats then use this huge revenue to purchase the> allegiance of consultants, contractors, big landowners, non-governmental> organisations (NGOs), corporations, charities and municipalities. In other> words, all the articulate and powerful groups they rely on to keep themselves> in employment. Unsurprisingly, the people running the EU have little time for> the concept of representative government.This is how the entire global system works in accordance with the Blueprint Idescribed earlier. Hannan exposed the claim by the EU in 2003 to be ‘consultingthe people’ about the draft of a new constitution by inviting 200‘representative organisations’ to submit their suggestions. It turned out thatall 200 were receiving grants from the European Union. ‘If you scratch thesurface, you find that virtually every field of activity has some EU-sponsoredpressure group to campaign for deeper integration, whether it be the EuropeanUnion of Journalists, the European Women’s Lobby or the European Cyclists’Federation.’ These were not independent associations which just happen to be inreceipt of EU funds, he said. ‘They are, in most cases, creatures of theEuropean Commission, wholly dependent on Brussels for their existence.’ Hannancontinued:> The EU has also been active in spreading its tentacles to established> charities and lobbying groups within the nation states. The process starts> harmlessly enough, with one-off grants for specific projects. After a while,> the organisation realises that it is worth investing in a ‘Europe officer’> whose job, in effect, is to secure bigger grants. As the subventions become> permanent, more ‘Europe officers’ are hired. Soon, the handouts are taken for> granted and factored into the organisation’s budget. Once this stage is> reached, the EU is in a position to call in favours.When he introduced the Bill to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in 2007, the thenForeign Secretary, David Miliband [Rothschild Zionist], made a great song anddance that it was backed by a whole range of independent organisations includingthe NSPCC, One World Action, Action Aid and Oxfam. Yet every organisation hecited was in receipt of EU subventions. In a single year, Action Aid, the NSPCC,One World Action and Oxfam had among them received €43,051,542 (£33,855,355).Can organisations in receipt of such colossal subsidies legitimately claim to beindependent? Hardly surprising that they should dutifully endorse a treatysupported by their paymasters. In much the same way, the Commission pays Friendsof the Earth to urge it to take more powers in the field of climate change. Itpays the WWF to tell it to assume more control over environmental matters. Itpays the European Trade Union Congress to demand more Brussels employment laws.The EU hoses cash at these dependent organisations, who then tell it what itwants to hear. It then turns around and claims to have listened to ‘The People’.Once again this is how the entire global system operates. This is why I say itis all Archontic bollocks – all corruption and contempt for the interests of thetarget human population. Daniel Hannan points out how the EU bureaucracy worksfor the benefit of the transnational corporations and Big Pharma. Of course itdoes – it is an arm of the Archon bloodlines that own the corporations and BigPharma as they own the EU. Hannan concluded:> These days, the EU’s strength is not to be found among the diminished ranks of> true believers or the benign cranks who distribute leaflets for the Union of> European Federalists. Nor, in truth, does it reside primarily among the> officials directly on the Brussels payroll.> The real power of the EU is to be found in the wider corpus of interested> parties – the businesses invested in the regulatory process; the consultants> and contractors dependent on Brussels spending; the landowners receiving> cheques from the Common Agricultural Policy; the local councils with their EU> departments; the seconded civil servants with remuneration terms beyond> anything they could hope for in their home countries; the armies of lobbyists> and professional associations; the charities and the NGOs.> Here is the swollen European behemoth, its interests utterly tied into the> European project. And I fear it’s not going to stand aside for a cause so> trivial as public opinion or democracy.The EU is a major expression of what is called the post-industrial,post-democratic society in which unelected bureaucrats, technocrats and‘experts’ dictate to an oppressed human society. We are seeing this unfoldingevery day. You can see the Totalitarian Tiptoe everywhere, including with thesystematic destruction of the United States. You cannot have a dictatorshipcontrolling the world if there are superpowers with the financial and militarymight to say no to you and so, through the Totalitarian Tiptoe andProblem-Reaction-Solution, US economic power is being systematically dismantled.America is being destroyed by design financially and militarily and here youhave the reason why the national debt has been allowed to reach insane and fatalproportions and its manufacturing base and employment transferred to Mexico, theFar East and elsewhere, together with millions of other jobs. America has playeda crucial part in the Archon bloodline plan in its years as a superpower. It wasplayed off against the Soviet Union to instigate the Cold War that allowed somuch to be justified that otherwise could not have been, such as the frenziedbuild-up of nuclear weapons and ‘defence’ (attack) spending in general. We areseeing the world government coming ever closer through the Totalitarian Tiptoeand the incessant centralisation of power. The agreement of the BritishGovernment to ‘share’ (dominate) ‘joint diplomatic missions’ around the worldwith Canada (and the same planned with Australia and New Zealand) is all part ofthis centralisation of global power and the end of national sovereignty. Thedeal was agreed by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, little boy in shorttrousers and child in an adult body, who jumps to attention – yes sir, no sir –whenever his masters demand. All this is happening, tick, tick, tick, via theTotalitarian Tiptoe while humanity concerns itself with X-Factor, The Price isRight and which celebrity is shagging another. All are Archon media diversionsdispensed like a magician who wants you look at his left hand while he tricksyou with the right.So these are just some of examples of Problem-Reaction-Solution and theTotalitarian Tiptoe, the most used and most effective techniques of the Archonmanipulation of individual and mass perception. An awareness of them makes youimmediately so much harder to fool with the daily engineered problems, disastersand conflicts machine-gunned at us through the mainstream media."},{"pageContent":"NEIL HAGUE GALLERYThe unique art of a world class artist[../Images/00569.jpg]The world is not 'solid' as it appears to be, but holographic (illusory'solid'). Our apparently 'physical' reality is a decoded projection of waveforminformation fields – the Metaphysical Universe. Body-Mind decodes waveforminformation into electrical, digital and holographic reality within a tinyfrequency band called visible light.[../Images/00072.jpg][../Images/00468.jpg]The 'physical' (holographic) world only exists when it is 'observed' (decoded)and that includes the human body. When any part of our 'physical' reality is notbeing decoded it exists only in its waveform state.[../Images/00376.jpg]We see the world as 'solid', but that is a holographic illusion decoded fromwaveform information. The world is but a dream within a dream.[../Images/00131.jpg]We are Infinite Awareness having an experience within a particular band offrequency. Our name, sex, race, culture, religion, job and 'life story' are not'who we are', but merely a brief focus of attention.

We are not Ethel Jones or David Icke - we are InfiniteAwareness, the All That Is, Has Been And Ever Can Be - All Possibility.[../Images/00425.jpg]Everything within in our reality is a holographic expression of waveforminformation. Planets and stars are waveform/electrical/digital phenomena and asthey move and interact they change the nature of the universalwaveform/electrical/digital information fields to which ourwaveform/electrical/digital levels are connected. In doing so, they influenceour states of being. We call this 'astrology'.[../Images/00132.jpg]Our 'astrological field', absorbed at birth (some say conception), interactswith the ever-changing universal field in a different way to someoneborn/conceived at a different point in the cycle'.Everything, no matter how 'solid' it may appear to be, is the holographicprojection of waveform information and so at the waveform level everything isconnected. This is how it is possible to communicate with animals and what iscalled the natural world. This is not done by voice to 'ear' communication, butat the waveform and electromagnetic levels of reality which are ultimately thesame energy source or, as some have called it, the collective unconscious whichconnects all expressions of itself.[../Images/00489.jpg]There is no time or space. These are decoded illusions, just as a computer gameappears to have time and space when it is only information encoded on a disk. Wethink that what we see in the night sky is a fantastic distance away and yet itall exists in a small area of the brain which is decoding waveform informationinto holographic 'visual reality'.[../Images/00046.jpg]Earth people once interacted with reality through the heart vortex, theHeart-Mind, and the brain served the heart instead of dominating perception asit has since the Archon hijack.[../Images/00471.jpg]Crucial to the takeover by the demented 'Hannibal Lecter' Archons was a schismin the waveform fabric of our reality which triggered a series of cataclysmicevents that destroyed the 'Avatar' global society and humanity had to startagain.[../Images/00123.jpg]The schism or massive distortion at the waveform level was decoded through intoholographic distortion – monumental 'physical' upheavals and a transformation ofhumanity's sense of self and reality.[../Images/00276.jpg]The Archons engaged in genetic manipulation to shut down much of the humanreceiver-transmitter system and re-tune RNA/DNA to a fake reality – the Matrix.Humans were now living in a manufactured illusion while believing it to be'real'.

They andtheir hybrid agents are working to tune the population into this blueprintfrequency band so they will decode into holographic being their own globalprison.
