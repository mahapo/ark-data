Three little words, with enormous implications.In fact they tell only part of the story. Heal yourself, heal the world would bemore accurate; and heal yourself, heal the world and let the world heal you,would be even more so.For nothing happens in isolation. There are no islands set apart. I am you andyou are me. We are all part of One Consciousness, One Mind, that is Creation. Itis the amalgamation of all thought, experience, understanding and wisdom we knowas God or, as I prefer, the Infinite Mind.You are God. I am God. We are all God. So when we say heal the world, it is nota one-way process. It is not a case of one person or group of people appearingover the horizon like some spiritual cavalry to save the planet. Yes, we canhelp to heal this glorious expression of life called Planet Earth, but the Earthcan heal us, also. We are part of her and she is part of us. We are all the sameconsciousness at different levels of evolution and understanding.If we don’t heal our own wounds we cannot heal the planet. Physician, healthyself."},{"pageContent":" 2Love Yourself, Love the WorldI have seen, in the light of extreme experience, how people constantly projectout into the world what they think of themselves. I have observed outwardlyaggressive people venting their inner hatred of themselves on others aroundthem. Their victims are merely mirrors for them to thrash out in anger andfrustration at their dislike, even contempt, for all that they are and havebeen. This is the real motivator behind so much violence, crime, and negativebehaviour of all kinds.People were persuaded by the media at one stage that I was mentally ill becauseof the information I was presenting. As a result, many people came along toridicule and laugh when I spoke at universities and public meetings. They didnot realise that in doing so they were making a mighty statement aboutthemselves, not me. How sobering it would have been had they asked themselveswhat imbalance must exist within for them to have gleaned pleasure and enjoymentfrom ridiculing someone they believed to be mad. When you do not respect othersyou are merely saying you have no respect for yourself.How often have you noticed how people get angry and upset with those who act inways that they themselves also act? How often have we said of such people: ‘It’sokay when they do so and so, but when someone else does it they go crazy’? Whatwe are seeing is that person reacting against someone who mirrors back at themthe character traits they dislike in themselves. On a couple of occasions whenpeople have laughed at me in the street, I and my family have stopped andlaughed back at them, mirroring their behaviour, to see what happened. Thereaction was extraordinary. They became very angry, even outraged, as they cameface to face with their own behaviour. When we see others expressing what wedon’t like about ourselves we feel very uncomfortable, and that can manifest inoutward anger and condemnation. We appear to be angry with another, but reallywe are angry with ourselves.Humanity’s problem in general, if not in every ‘individual’, is that far fromrespecting itself, liking itself, loving itself, it hates itself. Humanity isawash with guilt, fear, and lack of self-esteem, and this goes back throughscores of previous physical lifetimes as well as this one. It is this guilt,fear, and self-hatred that is expressed through division, war, conflict on alllevels, and in the belief that somehow material ‘success’ can compensate for thespiritual and emotional black hole that grows like a cancer within so many.And by spiritual I do not mean religious. The two are constantly confused.Spiritual for me means a reconnection with the One Consciousness, anunderstanding of our part in the eternal scheme of things and our infinitepotential for love and creation. Religion has hijacked spirituality and largelyabused its name to build empires of myth and power, engineered and perpetuatedby the manipulation of fear and guilt. Spirituality is the answer while, instark contrast, religion is part of the problem.I talk of the need for self-respect and self-love, and yet religion constantlytells us we have sinned and must feel guilty about all that we are. I heard alady brought up in a Roman Catholic convent say how she was forced to reciteevery morning that she was unworthy. The whole religious, economic and socialsystem is designed to make us feel either guilty, fearful, unworthy,dissatisfied or envious – indeed often all of them, and more, at the same time.This is terribly destructive both for people and the planet.Self-love and self-respect are crucial to the future well-being of the earthbecause the extreme negative energies we have created and continue to create bythe way we feel about ourselves, and therefore others, have taken this planet tothe brink of non-existence. We are going to reverse this process – and to dothat we need to understand the structure within which we all live and evolve. Weneed to appreciate how we are affecting the balance of the earth and each otherwith every thought.[../Images/00008.jpg]The Seven Chakras"},{"pageContent":" 3The Real UsThe physical body is a vehicle for the mind, our consciousness, to experiencethis physical level. The real thinking, feeling, eternal us is not the body, buta series of energy-fields working as one. I call this the mind to avoid thereligious connections associated with the word ‘soul’.Joining these fields together are seven main vortex points known as chakras.These are at the top of the head (crown chakra), the forehead (brow chakra), thethroat (throat chakra), the centre of the chest (heart chakra), the solar plexus(solar plexus chakra), the navel (sacral chakra) and in the area of the sexualorgans (base chakra). There are others, but these are the major ones.Each chakra has a different role to play. The solar plexus chakra, for instance,works with the emotional level, and this is why we feel our emotions in thatarea. ‘I’ve got butterflies in my stomach’ – as many people say to describenervous moments. The heart chakra is the point of balance in the chakra systemand also the point from which the energy called love is expressed.Your mind, everything that is the real you, has worked through endless physicalbodies in endless situations over incomprehensible amounts of time. What you areexperiencing now is simply the latest of them, although potentially the mostimportant. I see the physical body as a genetic spacesuit. Just as we need aspacesuit to exist on the moon, so the mind, which is an amalgamation ofnon-physical energy-fields, needs a physical vehicle, the body, through which toexperience this physical world.The colour or design of your spacesuit is irrelevant, except as another form ofexperience. Those who condemn black people should know that they have almostcertainly been a black person themselves in a past life, or they will be in thefuture to balance out their eternal experience. The divisions of colour, sex,ethnic background, countries and religion, which cause so much pain andconflict, are the manifestations of human misunderstanding. No matter what thedesign or colour of the genetic spacesuit, we are all still of the OneConsciousness. Any apparent division is an illusion in the collective mind ofthe human race.Our consciousness has re-incarnated on its journey of experience into physicalbodies that were black, white, red, yellow, male, female, and into lifesituations that made us rich, poor, Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, etc. The factis that someone born in the United States is not more special than someone bornin Mexico; nor is someone born in England more special than someone born inPeru; nor someone who is white than someone who is black. Go down to theseashore, hold a droplet of water in your hand, and tell me how that droplet canpossibly be any more or less special than the billions of droplets you seebefore you in the ocean.Yet look what this misunderstanding of life has done to this world. The physicalbody is perceived to be the real us and so people are judged on the colour andorigin of the ancestral line of that physical body. It is like judging anastronaut on the design of his spacesuit. Healing ourselves and the planet willbe so much easier once we realise that.Creation consists of an infinite number of levels of evolution or ‘frequencies’.The frequencies of all the television and radio stations broadcasting to yourarea exist in the same space you are standing or sitting in now, and, in thesame way, so do the frequencies, wavelengths, of creation. When you tune yourradio to one of the broadcasting frequencies around you, that is the only oneyou receive. To the radio at that time, that is the only wavelength there is. Itis the same with the mind.At any point in our evolution we tune ourselves to one of creation’swavelengths, and that becomes our reality. At this moment we are tuned to thisdense physical wavelength, and this appears to be everything that is. But at theinstant we call physical ‘death’, the mind leaves this wavelength and moves toanother, because its period of experience on this level is over. Many millionsof people have had what are called near-death experiences, when they ‘die’ andare then revived.They describe how their consciousness left the physical body. That is all thathappens at what is known as ‘death’. The fear of death terrifies so many, whenreally it doesn’t exist. We don’t die – we are reborn onto another wavelength.Everything on that wavelength looks just as ‘solid’ as it does here, and allthose other ‘solid’ worlds exist in the same space as this one.How can this be? For the same reason that the broadcasting signals can passthrough the walls of your home to reach your radio. The wavelength of the wallis so different from that of the broadcast signal that one passes through theother as if the other isn’t there. When people see ‘ghosts’, they often appearas a misty figure. This is because the wavelength the ‘ghost’ is working on isdifferent to this one. When your radio dial is not quite on the right stationyou get a fuzzy, weak, less-than-sharp reception, with maybe bits of otherstations coming in as well. In visual terms that is what is happening when wesee ‘ghosts’, which are merely minds not in a physical shell. They appear mistyand transparent because we are not on the same wavelength as they – so ourreception is similarly fuzzy, weak and less-than-sharp. But if we were on theexactly same wavelength they would look as ‘solid’ as we do.I keep putting the word solid in quotes because, in truth, although we use thatword all the time, nothing is actually solid. Everything is energy vibrating atdifferent speeds. At slower speeds the energy is denser and so can appear to be‘solid’, but it is not. Everything that exists in any form is vibrating energy.We are vibrating energy, too. The speed our mind-energy is vibrating denotes ourlevel of evolution. The higher our ‘vibrations’, the higher our state ofevolution, knowledge, understanding and wisdom.We also project energy out into the world with every thought, because each timewe think we create an energy-field, positive, negative, or a balance of the two.This is the basis of telepathy. One mind creates a thought energy-field orthought-form and another decodes that field and turns it into words. You willnotice that many times two people will have the same thought at the same moment.One reason for this is that one person thinks of something, creates athought-field, and their friend unknowingly decodes that thought-field, whilebelieving it is their own thought. Hence you have the reaction of ‘Well I never.That’s just what I was thinking!’The question has long been asked: What is energy? Energy is movement, motion,and this motion is created by thought. Vibrating energy particles are notparticles in motion, but particles of motion. The particles are created bythought-patterns, and when those patterns change or disappear, the particlesthose patterns have created also change or disappear. So when you think love youcreate and generate the energy of love. The patterns formed by thoughts of lovecreate the energy called love, which can transform the world. Think negative andyou surround yourself with negative energy which, you, yourself, have created.This is how thought creates and also how we create our own reality. When I speakof negative and positive energies I am referring to negative and positivethought-patterns. Thought and energy are the same.[../Images/00003.jpg]Another key to understanding how we affect the Earth and each other with everythought is to appreciate that there needs to be some kind of balance between thenegative and positive energies within us and around us, if we are to avoidextremes. If we generate too much positive energy, we become ‘ungrounded’. Wefloat off in some imbalanced dreamlike state and lose touch with the practicalside of life. If we generate too much negative energy it shows itself in anger,conflict, a desire for power and control, and other unpleasant behaviour. Andwhat are the most powerful creators of negative energy? Guilt, fear, self-hatredand lack of self-worth, which, as I have outlined, lead to outward expressionsof anger, violence, conflict, and the need to dominate and control. This iswhere we came in.Over vast amounts of what we call time, humanity’s self-hatred, encouraged byforces that wish to destroy the planet, has generated fantastic amounts ofnegative thought-fields, which in turn have caused some appalling events. Thesehave led to an even lower sense of collective self-worth which has then led toeven more negative thought energy… On and on it goes. It is a spiral that mustbe broken if humanity is going to survive the process now in motion of keepingthe planet in incarnation. This tidal wave of negative energy has imbalanced theenergies all around us, and the mind of the planet, the Earth Spirit. All thenegative energy humanity has generated she has had to absorb, because we alllive within her gigantic energy-field, her mind.What happens when we become very emotionally upset? We stop thinking straight.Think of the implications, then, if you consider that it is the consciousness wecall the Earth Spirit, Mother Nature, Gaia, whatever name you prefer, that keepsthis planet together on every level. It is she who balances the weatherpatterns, the geological structure of the earth, the regeneration of nature, andthe mixture of oxygen in the atmosphere that allows life as we know it to existat all. If the mind that is responsible for this becomes imbalanced and ceasesto think straight, because of all that humans do and have done to her, justimagine what the consequences could be for everyone living on Planet Earth. Iwill not seek to hide it from you. Those are the implications that face us now,today, if we do not heal ourselves, so the Earth Spirit can be healed and ceaseto be bombarded with negative energy.What I seek to do here is pass on what I have learned from my own experiences,and offer some answers to the question so many are asking today: What can we do?"},{"pageContent":" 4Think FreedomFreedom of thought is the greatest of all freedoms. From this all other freedomscome. It is also the very foundation of self-healing and self-respect.The system, the status quo that currently controls the physical world, can onlysurvive and continue on its ultimately suicidal course if it persuades enoughpeople not to think beyond the limitations it wishes to impose for its ownprotection. Once you free yourself from the conditioning we undergo from themedia, the education system, and other sources of ‘information’, you see thishuman-created world for what it is. Ridiculous. Thinking for yourself is fatalfor the system and must be avoided at all costs if it is going to maintain itsincreasingly tenuous grip on the human mind.This is why the system seeks to create structures designed to self-perpetuatethe status quo. You only pass your exams and progress within the system if youanswer the questions set by the system, in a way that is acceptable to thesystem. There was a time when if you had said in an exam that the earth wasround and not flat you would have failed. The same applies today with countlessother views held to be ‘fact’ by the status quo. You only become a doctor if yousay in your exams what conventional medicine wants you to say. So the way thebody is affected by our non-physical levels, past life experiences, the law ofkarma, and negative-positive imbalances, goes on being ignored by mainstreammedicine, to the enormous detriment of the patient.Examinations are just one way in which the system self-perpetuates and passes onits nonsenses across the generations. There are countless others. Look at theworld around you and you’ll see so much that is ludicrous which only survivesbecause it was here when we were born into the world. It survives because notenough people have opened their eyes and asked the question why? Why do we dothings this way? Who decided it? On what basis? And is it right that it shouldcontinue? Apathy, taking the line of least resistance, is the attitude of mindthe status quo depends upon for its survival.I would offer the following credibility test for something that was already herewhen we were born: If the same thing was being done today for the first timewhat would our reaction be? Take the Church as an example.Imagine that the Church did not exist and along came a group of people with abook of ancient texts. “We don’t know who wrote them” they would say “And wedon’t know when they were written or in what circumstances or how much they havechanged over the centuries for political reasons or how much of the originalmeaning has been lost in the translation. But we know it’s the word of God andall accurate even though it contradicts itself constantly and in parts is ajustification of violence, slavery, and the suppression of women.”Now imagine what we would think if the BBC came out and said that they weregoing to give free, guaranteed airtime to this new religion, and that thisairtime would not be there to debate and question, but to give this religion theplatform to say whatever it liked to promote its beliefs. Imagine also ourreaction if the British Government announced that it was going to makecompulsory the teaching of this new religion in the schools and that it would betaught on the basis that it is historically accurate and not just a story that acertain number of people believe to be true.Think how we would react. We would be on the streets with placards protestingagainst this imposition by an authoritarian state. We would be shouting“Moonies”, “thought control”, “indoctrination”, “mad cult”, and the like. Butwait. What I have described is precisely what happens in Britain and many othercountries all over the world today. Where are the people on the streetsprotesting? Where are the shouts of “mind control”? Nowhere. Why? Because allthis was here when we arrived and so we meekly accept it.When I was speaking in Houston, Texas, I went into a delicatessen for a cheesesandwich. When you don’t eat meat in Texas you survive on cheese sandwiches mostof the time. When the waitress came across I told her what I would like. Herface dropped immediately.“I can’t serve you a cheese sandwich here” she said, “If I did this place wouldbe shut down.”“What? Shut down because you serve me a cheese sandwich?”“Yes”.I was informed that I was in a Jewish delicatessen and it was against the rulesto serve cheese in a place where meat was also served. (I should point out thatthis deli was in the corner of a supermarket where you could buy all the cheeseand meat you liked.)“Who decided that you can’t serve cheese?” I asked, by now utterly stunned atwhat I was hearing.“I dunno, the Jewish hierarchy I guess.”“And when did they decide that?”“I dunno, thousands of years ago I think.”“So because of what the Jewish hierarchy decided thousands of years ago, I can’thave a cheese sandwich in Houston in 1993?”“That’s about the size of it, I guess.”The other interesting aspect to this story is that the more I asked questions,the more uncomfortable and indeed angry the waitress became. This was becauseshe, too, knew that the situation was ridiculous – but look at the implicationsfor her, a Jewish woman, of standing up and saying so. Her business would havebeen closed down by the Jewish leaders and she would probably have beencastigated by her family and friends. Much easier to take the line of leastresistance, allow the inherited nonsense to go on unchallenged and pass it on tothe next generation intact.Also while I was in Houston I was told another story which sums up what I feelis the vital point I am making here. A woman explained how she always used tocut the corners off a ham before she put it in the pan until one day her husbandasked why she did that.“I don’t know,” she replied. “My mother always used to do it and so I do it.”“Why did your mother do it?”“I don’t know, she just did it. What does it matter?”“Call your mother and ask her why she did it.”She made the call.“Mom, you know when I was a child, why did you always cut the corners off theham before you put it in the oven?”“Because my pan was never big enough.”Apply that simple story across the great tapestry of life on Earth today and youwill see how much destruction and imprisonment of thought continues only becausewe don’t have the vision to ask “why”. If we are going to break the cycles ofperpetuated illusion and misunderstanding, it is essential that we ask thatquestion constantly, and that means challenging situations and ways of thinkingthat do not wish to be challenged. That is going to take courage because courageis essential to world healing.The most important way the status quo survives is through fear. Freedom ofthought is really freedom from fear. The two are indivisible. The system hasbeen so effective in selling nonsense as wisdom that we now have a situation inwhich the most credible explanation of creation is immediately ridiculed orcondemned by reflex action. Talk of reincarnation, the eternal nature of thehuman consciousness and other wavelengths of life, has been largely laughed atby the system’s propaganda machine, the media.But promote what is, in my view, the most ludicrous idea that this teeming havenof interdependent life emerged by accident – and this is seen as perfectlyacceptable. This makes so many frightened to say what they really believebecause they think it will not be acceptable to their friends, the neighbours,the people they work with or the media. This fear suppresses the knowledge whichenormous numbers of people believe is the true basis of life.I have had letters from people saying they have long believed in all the themesI am highlighting, but they dare not even tell their wives or husbands becausethey fear the reaction. There was an ambulanceman I met who said that he hadrealised that medical science had great limitations of understanding when hebegan to feel a tremendous healing energy working through him when he was with apatient. But he dared not tell his colleagues because he felt they would say hewas crazy. The system has been very clever and highly successful in suppressingthe information that is likely to bring it down. This it has done by the skilleduse and manipulation of fear. Emotions like fear and guilt have their part toplay in the overall life experience, but on earth it has got out of hand. Thoseemotions are no longer experiences, but monsters that control the world.So the first stage of self-healing is the release of fear. What is there tofear? Fear of what our friends may think, our families, or the neighbours andpeople at work? They have every right to think what they like – but then so doyou. If they cannot respect your right to think something different from them,then they are making a statement about themselves, not you. And just ponder fora moment. You may see those whose reaction you fear as people with minds thatare closed. But wait. If you suppress your feelings and views because you fearwhat people around you with closed minds will say, you are allowing your life tobe controlled by closed minds.Being different is the only way to be in our society as it is today. Aninterviewer said to me once: “You are very controversial aren’t you?”. I repliedthat if I was not seen as controversial I would be very worried. What would itsay about me if what I was saying was considered acceptable to a system that isdestroying the world and causing so much pain, misery and violence in theprocess?Yes, I’m controversial – and I’m proud of it. But most people don’t live theirlives in the way they wish or think is right for them. They live them in amanner they think acceptable – non-controversial – to others. The message thesystem finds unacceptable is:THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR.The whole ‘power’ of the media was turned on me and my family and will continueto be so for a time yet. But here we are, stronger than ever, more confident andself-assured than ever, and with more true friends all over the world than everbefore.Step out of your closet of fear, lift your head high, and speak your truth tothe world. Then freedom will be yours."},{"pageContent":" 5Prisons of the MindIronically, even some organisations set up apparently to challenge the statusquo are also fearful to go too far. In other words, far enough. You need tobeware of how their limitations can be transferred to you.The environmental movement has played an important role in highlighting what weare doing to the planet, in our desire for more, more, more, and the constantdemand for an expansion of production and consumption – economic growth. Butthere is every sign as I write that environmental organisations who base theiranalysis on conventional science have stopped evolving their understanding ofthe wider picture within which they operate. Much of the reason for this is thatthey have allowed themselves to become mesmerised by human ‘science’, andfearful of challenging that ‘science’.They see ‘science’, much of which is not scientific at all, as the crutch totheir credibility. Humanity has become so conditioned to believe that scientistsare the fountain of knowledge (not true) that environmentalists feel that ifthey can support their argument scientifically it will increase theircredibility in the public mind. That may well be the case, given theconditioning I have just described, but the real question they could be askingis: are the scientists correct in what they say?On the one side the environmental movement is opposing the use and production ofendless potions and poisons created by conventional science, and yet at the sametime it looks to that same conventional science for the answers to the problemsthus created. Fear is the reason. The result is an imprisonment of thought.Green pressure groups will not let go of conventional scientific analysisbecause they fear they will lose credibility with the public, who have beenconditioned to worship the scientist. This is not to say that all thatsystem-serving science says is not valid. What it lacks, I would suggest, is avision that understands that its knowledge and research involves only a tinyfraction of all that is. Without this understanding it must by definition beoffering the world a highly imbalanced view. As Socrates said: ‘Wisdom isknowing how little we know.’The green movement is at a fork in the road. It must choose between fear – whichwill lead it to oblivion – or freedom of thought – which will lead it to thenext stage in its journey of evolution. That same choice is now being offered toevery man, woman and child on this planet. While the Greens have been portrayedas unconventional, their biggest weakness, I feel, is that they have not beenunconventional enough. Again we come back to fear.The answers to environmental decline will not come by persuading politicians andindustrialists that urgent and fundamental changes are required. Industrialistsare under pressure from others to increase production and profits because thatis what the system insists of them. Collectively politicians do and say whatthey think is necessary to be elected. You have a situation in which thepropaganda of the economic, political and social system encourages people to seelife in a certain way, and those people demand of their politicians the policiesthey believe will give them what the system has told them are the indicators of‘success’ – money, status and possessions. The politicians react to thosedemands, and the destruction of the planet not only goes on, but gains momentumwith every year, in the suicidal pursuit of more money and possessions for theminority at the expense of the majority and the Earth.I am not attacking politicians or industrialists here. They are trapped within asystem that insists they act in a certain way, otherwise they don’t becomepoliticians and industrialists in the first place. It is not people I amchallenging, but the thought-patterns that control those people. No one in aphysical body runs this system. What I describe as The System is reallythought-patterns which dominate the minds of billions of people. The only meansto change what politicians do is to change what they need to do and stand for toget elected. That means changing the collective thought-patterns of humanity, sowe think in another way and demand something very different from those whorepresent us.You can have all the legislation you like on environmental protection, butunless people start to think on a higher level of understanding, there willalways be ways around it. And, let’s not be naive here, legislation willconstantly be too little too late, because pressures on politicians not to allowenvironmental concerns to impinge on their obsession with economic growth willforever delay or dilute what is really needed. As then-President Bush saidbefore the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992: “I will agree to nothing that harmsAmerica’s economic growth”.So, yes, it is highly desirable for the environmental movement to encouragerecycling, non-polluting technology and lifestyles that are in harmony with theEarth, and not at war with her. Everything that lifts some of the burden fromMother Earth is to be welcomed, and all this is most certainly part of theprocess of healing the earth – or, to be more accurate, slowing down the rate atwhich we assassinate her. But it is but a speck of sand in a desert unless it issupported by a spiritual revolution and a reconnection of humanity to the OneConsciousness, the Infinite Mind of all that is.Only then will we have access to a level of understanding and perception inwhich harming the earth would not even occur to us, let alone requirelegislation to discourage it. Only then will we cease to generate thedestructive energies and vibrations that are continually imbalancing the EarthSpirit, and reducing her capacity to repair, regenerate and hold together thenatural flow and balance of life on her physical form. Time to move on, GreenMovement of the World! Time to see a much bigger canvas. Time to let the wallsaround your thinking fall away, and to allow the fear of going beyond theconventional scientific view to disperse and emerge as a new and greater vision.What has happened to at least large sections of the Green Movement is a warningto everyone. There is no end to the journey of understanding. It is trulyeternal. There are only stages along the way. The problem with movements and‘isms’ is that they can become ends in themselves. An organisation or movementis set up at a particular stage in the beliefs and perceptions of thoseinvolved. But instead of saying “This is what we believe now, and we will evolvethat view should new information come to light”, those organisations from thatpoint onwards see new information as a threat if it challenges the originalbeliefs on which their organisation was formed. For this reason they standstill, and the agenda moves beyond them. In the end they become irrelevant andthey crumble.Look at the Church. You would think that life ceased to evolve, certainlyspiritually, two thousand years ago. It’s okay to stand in a pulpit and talkabout this angel speaking to so and so, or God speaking to someone else. But ifyou say you are communicating with other levels of consciousness today, you arebranded as evil and working with the devil!! The Church’s desperation to hold onto a set of beliefs, decided largely by a Roman Emperor and a group of bishopsin 325AD, has led to more wars, deaths, torture, violence and mind-controlthrough fear and guilt than anything else in human history.These ‘spiritual’ empires have become a vehicle for personal and collectivepower which depends for its survival on holding back the tide of open thinking,which would otherwise expose the nonsense and contradictions of the view it hassought to impose upon the world. The Church, like so many organisations,reflects in its desperation to survive by the suppression of knowledge, thesystem as a whole. Indeed the Church is a fundamental part of the system. TheKing or Queen of the United Kingdom is crowned by the Archbishop and declared a‘defender of the faith’ or, it would be more appropriate to say, a symbolicdefender of the status quo for Church and State.‘Isms’ are prisons of the mind, be they Roman Catholicism, Communism,Capitalism, Socialism, Spiritualism, or whatever. Once you are involved in an‘ism’ you are, in subtle and less-than-subtle ways, encouraged not to allow yourthinking to expand beyond the walls of the ‘ism’. If you expand beyond thesewalls, you are seen as a threat, a traitor, not a ‘true’ Catholic, Socialist,Communist, or whatever. This can persuade you to suppress what your mind andheart are saying, and so you stay true to the ‘ism’, and not true to yourself.It is vital in the process of healing ourselves, and therefore the world, to bevery careful of organisations that stand still and see new ideas and informationas a danger rather than the next wonderful stage of evolution and understanding.That means most of them.Humanity is taught to see evolving views as a weakness, when it is the ultimatestrength. Evolving your understanding is seen as admitting you were ‘wrong’, orthat you made ‘mistakes’. Poppycock. There are no mistakes. What we callmistakes are essential experiences that open up our understanding. The twoperceptions of the same experience are very different. Mistake = guilt and lackof self-worth (negative). Learning experience = new understanding, evolution,and greater appreciation of potential and self-worth (positive).Be true to yourself and what your heart is telling you. That is what reallymatters. Of course work with others if you feel that is best for you – and Iwill talk more of this as we proceed – but always follow your own feelings andintuition of what is right and wrong. Have the confidence to stand firm withwhat you believe, and don’t allow others to apply pressure that will imposetheir often rigid and unevolving beliefs upon you. If you do, you will not healyourself – and certainly not heal the planet.‘Isms’ and organisations force people to compromise their views so the group canshow a ‘united’ front. This is considered essential, for some reason. I smilewhen I hear that a political party is ‘disunited’, and therefore (presumably) introuble. What is so wrong about having a group of people who do not agree oneverything, and are prepared to say so? Surely that is highly desirable, unlessyou want a world full of clones – which, of course, the system does. ‘Isms’ areterrified of being seen as anything but united, and so you get people eithersaying what they do not believe to be right, or suppressing their real views inan effort to protect some facade of unison. The revolution of humanity nowunderway will not be diluted by such fear. It is a revolution of self, andcompromising what we think and say to suit the desire for a unity of view has nopart in this. Saying what we really think and respecting another’s right tothink differently is the revolution.I feel that large parts of the environmental movement are threatening to becomejust another ‘ism’, another imprisoned belief-system. It is up to everyoneinside the movement to stop that happening or, failing that, to break free nowand see wider possibilities and other ways of healing the planet. Even areaswithin that vast tapestry of thinking known as the New Age movement are fallinginto the same trap. They are showing serious signs of becoming just anotherreligion, with their teachers and gurus and ‘living gods on earth’.Some parts of the New Age movement are becoming another industry emerging toexploit the gathering public interest in these subjects and the confusion ofthose turning their minds to these areas for the first time. There are so many‘services’ on offer and so much past/present life ‘counselling’ available whichis simply nonsense and irrelevant to your personal growth and transformation.Often the only effect they have is to confuse and divert you, part you from yourmoney, and make you distrustful of the whole subject.Whenever people want to exploit something, it is essential to complicate it ormake it appear complicated. Once they do that, others who do not understand themanufactured complications can be exploited. The economic system of the worlddoes that and so, it should be said, do parts of the New Age movement. Theprocess of awakening and transformation is much more straight forward and simplethan some would have you believe. Open your mind and your heart and don’t letkarmic counsellors, rebirthing tanks, and all the other New Age paraphernaliaget in the way. At the very least, the overwhelming majority of it is quiteunnecessary.Beware on your spiritual journey. Listen to people, even dip into organisationshere and there if it feels right. But if anyone tells you what you must think,or if anyone looks upon you differently because you think differently to them,it’s time to go. What can be a good source of information and even inspiration,can also be, if you are not careful, a prison of the mind."},{"pageContent":" 6Taking ControlThe human race, certainly in the ‘developed’ world, seems to have a desperatedesire to pass on to someone else its responsibility to think and act – to an‘ism’, church, teacher, cult, rule-book, boss or politician.We are all encouraged to do this. While governments may talk of the need forself-responsibility they are the last people who would actually want to see ithappen. When you take responsibility for your own thoughts and actions, thecredibility of the system, governments included, falls before your eyes. It isthis ability to get people to pass on their responsibility to the system thathas allowed it to maintain its pre-eminence.One sees this desire to pass on responsibility every day. When you meet anofficial in a uniform and peaked cap, you often get the answer: “Rules is rules,mate. It’s more than my job’s worth to go against the rules”. The personinvolved is merely refusing to take responsibility for making a decision becausethey feel more comfortable surrendering that responsibility to a rule book.I remember going into a car park once and I went across to the attendant to askhow much it would be for five hours. He quoted a large sum of money.“But hold on”, I said, “In another hour’s time it will be 6pm and it says onyour board that it is only 50 pence for the rest of the evening after that.Surely I pay the full price until then and the rest of the night should cost me50 pence?”“No sir. If you want to qualify for the 50 pence price you will have to comeback at six o’clock, take your car out into the street, turn around and comeback in.”I waited for him to laugh. He didn’t.“Rules is rules, mate”, was his general reply and that made life so much easierfor him. No decisions to make, no responsibility to take. The system isslavishly served and the rule book rules, ok?There are billions who hand over responsibility to those most famous of rulebooks, the Bible, the Koran, and others. They are desperate to believe that allthe decisions they need to make are waiting for them within the covers of booksfull of contradictions and mis-translations written centuries ago, often bywho-knows-who in who-knows-what circumstances.In the New Age movement there are people giving their responsibility to ateacher or guru, or to a discarnate consciousness communicating through a mediumor channeller. By all means use these as sources of information, but in the endwe must all make our own decisions on what we feel is right for us. Life onearth is all about self-responsibility, and much as we may try there is noavoiding that if you wish to evolve. The law of cause and effect – karma – seesto that.The mind has free will to make decisions and learn from the consequences ofthem. Every day we are facing situations, making decisions (or allowing othersto make them for us!), and learning from the result. The law of karma, which Ifeel is a sort of electromagnetic process, draws to us what we need to balanceout our evolution. Everything is energy, even situations and experiences. I feelthat through a form of electro-magnetism we are drawing to us the energies –people, situations, etc – that we require. We are constantly experiencing bothsides of the balance-point so we eventually see where that balance-pointactually is. We only recognise lukewarm because we have experienced hot andcold. In the simplest of terms, what we do to others will be done to us, or, asthe Bible says: “What you sow you shall reap”. There are many themes of truthwithin the Bible amid the misunderstandings, but those themes are not unique tothat book. The idea that what you sow you shall reap is common to many cultures,beliefs, and civilisations.Before each new incarnation the mind decides what it wishes to experience inthat physical life. What it needs to balance out in its experience or karma willbe a fundamental part in that decision. Many of our experiences in this life areto balance out what we have experienced in previous lives. This is notpunishment. There is no judgmental God saying you have sinned and you must bepunished. We make those decisions, but we make them when we are free from thelimitations imposed by the physical body. When we decide a life-plan we do itfrom a much more enlightened perspective to the one we inherit when we findourselves looking through our eyes into the physical world. We know that we needthe interplay of negative and positive energies to create the understanding thatraises our vibratory frequency and allows us to evolve. Without this interplaywe would, at best, stand still.As one psychic communication said: “Balance is a blissful and glorious state,but it is also a static one. To continually evolve to higher levels ofunderstanding requires the interaction of positive and negative energies createdby positive and negative experience. It is the interplay of negative andpositive energies that allow the vibrations to quicken.”What we do not need, however, are the massive extremes we see on earth. I seeevolution as a series of stages between points of negative-positive balance. Ifeel that when you reach that state of balance you are at the top of onefrequency or level of evolution and able to progress to the next one. Once youare there, the negative-positive interplay begins again as you seek thebalance-point at that new level of information and understanding. You won’t beforever reincarnating into this physical level. When you have reached thebalance-point you will move up and onwards from here – indeed the greatestopportunity is being offered for you to do that now in this life.So what does all this mean in our daily lives? Quite simply that to believe wecan pass on our responsibility to someone or something else is an illusion, andin terms of our evolution, a dangerous one. If you follow the instructions ofanother, instead of making that decision for yourself, it doesn’t matter tokarma. You will, in karmic terms, need to experience whatever you have madeothers experience – even if your action was the result of what someone else toldyou or advised you to do.For so many reasons, people need to realise that we are all responsible for ourevery thought and act, and that what we do to others will need to be done to usto balance our evolution. Only in that way will we free ourselves from the rulebooks, cults, religions, power-structures and other manifestations ofmind-control. What others think and do is their responsibility. What we thinkand do is ours."},{"pageContent":" 7Not GuiltyAh yes, guilt. Along with fear it is the most rampant emotional cancer known tothe human race. Until we rid ourselves of guilt there will be no self-worth andno healing of ourselves or the Earth.Why do we feel guilty? Because society, programmed by inherited ‘values’,bombards us with endless things to feel guilty about. And that’s the point, youknow. Most of the limitations on what is defined as ‘acceptable’ human behaviourare mostly not even decided by the generations subjected to those limitations.We inherit them.I use the example in another book of the slogan I saw on a tee-shirt which said:‘Jesus had long hair’. We don’t actually know what the man we call Jesus lookedlike, but that’s by the by. It is taken for granted that this figure had longhair. So why do we have people who go to church to apparently worship this manand then, when they see youngsters with long hair, they say: “Look at those longhaired lay-abouts – how can their parents allow them to go out looking likethat?”This reaction is not because long hair is right or wrong. For goodness’ sakewhat does it matter, and what business is it of anyone else anyway? No, thereason long hair is seen by many as unacceptable results from the conditioningthose people have allowed themselves to be subjected to. When they were borninto this world, they inherited the values of the time which were, in turn, thevalues passed on from previous generations. So they go through their livesbelieving short hair is good and long hair is bad. Yet had long hair beenacceptable and the norm in our society when they came into the world, they mightnow be going along the street saying: “Look at those short-haired lay-abouts –how can their parents allow them to go out looking like that?”The values of a society at any one time have little, often nothing, to do withright and wrong. They are only that society’s perception of what is right andwrong, a perception mostly inherited from the past. There was a time, forexample, when the whole idea of slavery was acceptable to our society. But didthat make slavery right? Of course not. It was an abomination. Much of what isacceptable in the world would be resisted or ridiculed if it were being startedfor the first time today. Such ‘values’ survive only because they were part ofsociety when people were born and they become accepted because of that. But allthese so-called ‘values’, which remain by default, by not being challenged, arethe source of enormous guilt which entraps humanity in a web of self-disdain.That little word sex is perhaps the biggest creator of guilt. If you trace backour society’s values surrounding sex you will find that their origins lie inreligion or the interpretation of religion. The limitations we impose uponourselves about sex in the last decade of the 20th century were largely decidedby religion centuries ago. These are the values that say you should only havesexual intercourse if you have said some words in a church at a marriage serviceor if you have signed a piece of paper in a registry office. Do those words in achurch make any difference to how much love those people have for each other?No. Does signing a piece of paper in the presence of a government official makeany difference to that love? No.Then why on earth is it considered okay to express love physically if you have amarriage certificate, and unacceptable if you don’t? Again it has nothing to dowith right and wrong and everything to do with society’s perception – in thiscase a perception decided by someone’s interpretation of the Bible, the KingJames version of which, has, according to the enlightened historian ArthurFindlay, at least 36,191 errors in translation. I love my wife Linda witheverything I have, but I would not have got married if my awakening had happenedover twenty years ago. I do not see it as relevant to the way I think about her.I love her deeply. A piece of paper makes no difference to that.Going on from society’s view of marriage and sex is the belief that it is onlyacceptable to love one person at any one time. You apparently have to fall outof love with one man or woman and part before you can express love physically toanother. Even then to be fully acceptable you have to marry the new partnerbefore any ‘hanky-panky’ takes place, and you may find that some churchmen willrefuse to marry you because they do not believe in divorce.But let’s just look at this for a second. We are all aspects of the same OneConsciousness. We are all part of each other. Society is saying to us that wecan only express physical love to what is another aspect of ourselves if we havea piece of paper signed on the law’s behalf. It is further saying that we can’tmake love with a second aspect of ourselves unless we ditch the first aspect,somehow cease to love them, and get another piece of paper signed by an officialto link us by law to the second aspect. Yes, I know it’s absolute nonsense, sowhy do we allow it to go on unchallenged? Fear, that’s why. This is one reasonwhy the elimination of fear from our lives goes alongside the elimination ofguilt.Why should making physical love to other aspects of the One Consciousness affectour relationship and the deep, unbreakable love we may have for the aspect thatwe may be spending our physical life with? In reality it should have no effectbecause we are all each other in different genetic spacesuits. But it does havean effect, of course. It causes great pain and emotional upheaval for allinvolved and can smash relationships into tiny pieces. But what causes that painand emotional upheaval? Is it that making love with more than one aspect ofourselves is wrong? No, how can it be, when viewed from a wider perspective oflife? The pain is caused by what we are all programmed from birth to believe iswrong, and what society believes is wrong. The pain is not caused by whathappens, but the way we are programmed to perceive what happens.If we were born into a society which understood that we are all aspects of thesame whole and viewed each other in that way, then the values we inherit aboutsex, love and guilt, would be very different. In turn so would our reaction. Notexpressing love in a wider sense would be seen as unusual, and the idea ofpossessing another rather than loving them unconditionally, and seeing physicallove with other aspects as a natural part of life, would be the exception ratherthan the rule. It’s merely a matter of the indoctrinated social view of what is‘decent’ behaviour and what is not.Don’t get me wrong here. I am not suggesting a sexual free-for-all. And I am nottalking about making physical love with every aspect you can find! It may wellbe that you have only one sexual partner in a physical life because that is whatyou decided in your life-plan or what you feel is right. The point I am makingis that others who have different life-plans and choose other values are notwrong, just as you are not wrong. You are different, that’s all, and that issomething to celebrate, not scorn. We are born free, we ‘die’ free, we areeternally free. There are no limitations except for those we invent and imposeupon ourselves. It is our mind-controlled society that seeks to turn us intoimprisoned robots and, in the case of billions of people, has largely succeededin doing so.What I am saying about sex is that we need to follow our intuition. There aremany reasons why we may need to make physical love with more than one partner,and if we are honest with ourselves our intuition will tell us what is behindthe motivation to do so. I say from experience that if you are meant to makelove with someone and you are in close enough synchronisation with your highermind, then it will happen. The energies that will be switched on at many levelswill ensure that it happens. There are scores of reasons why this may be part ofa life-plan, particularly at this time:[../Images/00004.jpg]It may be for the personal development, awakening andunderstanding of others around you who have chosen to cope with thesociety-inspired emotional trauma that their partner’s sexual relationship withanother creates. Should it all happen very publicly it is almost certainlybecause the experience is designed to affect the way people in general think,too.[../Images/00004.jpg]It could be that energies within both people need to beactivated. There is a chakra vortex-point in the area of the sexual organs, andthese interact during sexual contact. It can be that these energies stimulate,awaken, each other, and/or they combine to create energies for healing theplanet. While misguided humanity sees sex as a physical act, higher levels seeit as the bringing together of energy fields, energy-patterns. Particularly ifyou are working with earth energies it may mean you need sexually to combineenergy-patterns with two or even more aspects of the One Consciousness. It couldjust as easily mean that you do not. It depends on what you are here to do.[../Images/00007.jpg][../Images/00004.jpg]While society is programmed to see the conception ofchildren as the conception of the whole human being, the higher levels ofunderstanding see conception as the creation of the physical vehicle for theincoming mind. That physical vehicle, the body, needs to have the correctgenetic inheritance and energy-combinations provided by the parents for thatmind’s life-plan to be successfully carried out. If you carry certain geneticcodes and energies it may well be that both have to combine with more than onepartner to provide the ideal genetic and energy make-up for the differentchildren you conceive. For instance combining with your ‘life-partner’ may becorrect for most of the children you create, but you may need to combine withanother energy-pattern to produce the ideal physical and energy combination foranother child. Society cries ‘adulterer!’, while the incoming mind says: ‘Thankyou very much – this body is just what I wanted!’ I have no doubt that the manwe call Jesus fathered children. His genetic code and energy patterns would nothave been wasted. They would have been passed on.[../Images/00004.jpg]It can also be that the two people involved are merely thephysical vehicles for energies from higher levels to flow through them to createa physical body. This is where the idea of the ‘Immaculate Conception’ may haveoriginated.There is much more to sexual contact than we have understood, and we should notfeel guilty about it. The myths and bigotry handed to us from a misguided,Bible-obsessed past mean that we even have two types of children, ‘legitimate’and ‘illegitimate’. Yet the only difference between the two is a piece of papersaying ‘married’! Write it in letters ten feet high: ALL LIFE IS EQUALLYLEGITIMATE.There are people who frown on one-parent families. They say a child needs twotraditional parents, and they seek to impose this in many cases. What a childneeds, what all children and all people need, is love. That’s the key word. Ihave seen many children brought up in an ‘acceptable’ family situation who haveenjoyed anything but love from their parents. I have also seen children livingwith only a mother, a father, or a guardian, who are surrounded by tremendouslove. If you were a child, which one would you pick if you had to choose? Andlet us not forget that the incoming mind has control over when and where itincarnates. They know the score before birth, and they make the decision, no oneelse.Homosexuality can be a generator of great guilt and pain, because of the way itis viewed by programmed people. But what can possibly be wrong with one aspectof the Infinite Consciousness showing their love physically for another who justhappens to have the same design of genetic spacesuit? We are all different,thank goodness. Love is love: and the love of one man for another or one womanfor another is no less valid or ‘legitimate’ than that between a male andfemale.The irony is that because of all the guilt, myths and misguided ‘values’surrounding the subject, modern society has become obsessed with sex. Withouttheir daily batch of stories linked to sex, what on earth would the tabloidpress find to write about? When we begin to appreciate that sex is merely a wayof expressing love for another aspect of ourselves and, more to the point, forcreation as a whole, then the human race will become less obsessed with sex, notmore. The bigger the taboo, the bigger the obsession with it. Fortunatelyattitudes about sex are changing and that change will become a transformation inthe years ahead.The only thing I would stress again is that it is important to follow yourintuition on these things, and beware of illusions leading you into situationswith people that are not part of your pre-planned life experience. There havebeen many life-plans shattered in this way.But whatever you have done or will do in your life there is no need to feelguilty. Everything you experience is adding to the evolution of everyone else,either because of what others experience as a result, or from what you haveexperienced and pass on to the Infinite Mind as a whole. There are no suchthings as mistakes, only learning from experience, and the only true love isunconditional love, which allows each other to learn from experience withoutgrudge or judgement. Other versions are not love in its purest sense.That’s another thing about guilt: the way we feel bad about hurting those welove. This is quite understandable, but what is true love? To quote a channelledmessage I have used in every book: “True love does not always give the receiverwhat it would like to receive, but it will always give that which is best forit”.If you have acted towards someone in a negative way it may have been your freewill overriding your higher mind. But it could just as easily have been yourhigher mind offering a learning experience to the victim of your negativebehaviour. As I have already said, we need a combination of negative andpositive experiences (energies) for the negative-positive interplay to takeplace, that quickens our vibrations and allows us to evolve through a frequency.Negative experiences are as essential as positive. It is a balance of the two weare after. The same applies to the way people react to us. In my autobiography,In the Light of Experience, I have highlighted how those who have acted towardsme in the most negative fashion have done the most to awaken my innerunderstanding.Sometimes we need a negative experience to help us think and awaken to life andourselves as we really are. I have known people who have changed their entirethinking and become much happier and more contented when very negative eventslike cancer, a heart attack or business crash, have forced upon them a need toreassess their lives, perceptions and priorities. I have no doubt that you canlook back at your life and feel really guilty about giving someone a badexperience, but there is an excellent chance that your behaviour waspre-arranged to help that mind evolve. If it was your free will and notpre-arranged, well you have learned from the guilt you feel. Now is the time tolet it go. Whatever we do, there will always be the chance to put right what wehave done, if not in this physical life, then in another, or on another level ofreality. Life is forever.The other guilt-creator I see scattered around like confetti is the idea thatevery negative experience we have must be ‘our karma’. Some people feel reallyguilty because they think that a terrible event in their lives must be a sort ofkarmic retribution for something they have done in the past. Well, yes, perhapsit might be a balancing of experiences. But it is not retribution or punishment,it is the balancing of energies and understanding – a gift which they havechosen to give themselves to speed their evolution. It is also a gift they aregiving to everyone else.How often have we avoided unpleasant situations because we have seen others getinto trouble? We have learned from another’s unpleasant experience. Instead ofcondemning such people for their behaviour, we could thank them for theircontribution to enlightenment. And they themselves need to let go of their guiltand understand what they are doing for others. As we hear so often on the newsbulletins, as people in great distress say: “I only hope that some good comes ofthis, and it never happens to anyone else”. When one person’s suffering alertshumanity to the need for change, it can prevent so many others suffering in thesame way, and worse, in the future.And, let me emphasise that not every negative event in our lives is our ‘karma’.We might be being subjected to another’s free will, and there are many on theplanet at this time who are here to undergo experiences, often highly negative,to work out some of humanity’s collective karma. Karma works on many levels.Besides personal karma, there is family karma, national karma, planetary karma,and more. These are the energy-imbalances created by these various groups overthe centuries, and minds have come into incarnation to help clear theseimbalances. This can mean going through some awful experiences to act as sort ofspiritual kidney machines, attracting negative energies from the sea of energyall around us, and transmuting them through their energy-fields into positive orbalanced energy. You tune into certain collective thought-patterns and ‘live’them. This can appear very negative and painful at the time. Then through thatexperience you change your thinking and break that collective thought-pattern.Some people describe this as like hoovering the frequency of collective negativeimbalances. Thought-patterns can be like railway lines which lead you to thinkand behave in a certain way. Pattern-breakers travel along those lines, but thenchange their whole way of thinking. This helps to break that pattern, thatvibratory state, and in turn others are less affected by it until it no longerexists at all. It is at this level of thought-patterns that the status quo isbeing overturned, day after day.You could quite easily be one of those pattern-breakers, and many of yourexperiences may not be the karma from your own past behaviour, but thecollective behaviour of a group, or humanity as a whole. We don’t know for sure,and the only way we can react is to accept what comes our way, and deal with itin the most positive, loving manner we can – loving especially ourselves, andnot feeling guilty.We feel guilty when we cannot cope with a situation and it is seen as a sign ofweakness to ‘go under’ emotionally for a while. Big boys are told not to cry,and they feel guilty if they do. This is all programmed bunkum. If a few bigboys allowed themselves to cry more often, that emotional release would stopmany a heart attack. There are times when things become too much to handle, andour emotions collapse. This is natural, and nothing to feel guilty about.As you begin to move ever faster along your spiritual path, be kind to yourself.One form of guilt is feeling guilty about being less than pure and perfect withevery thought and act. Let’s be honest, some people, whether through free willor pre-arranged experience, are a pain in the backside sometimes. We all arewhen we want to be. If we feel guilty about every thought that confirms thatsome people can irritate us, we are going to feel guilty quite a lot. Let thosethoughts take their course and then let them go. Later you will find it withinyourself to see that those who irritate us are on a journey of experience, too,and coping with that very irritation helps us to learn and evolve. As time goeson, we find that we don’t get so affected by another’s negative behaviour, andeventually we are not affected at all.It is the same with the process of loving unconditionally. It is just that: aprocess. Guilt can come if you are frustrated with yourself at not being able tosee everyone in those terms immediately. It will come, but let it come in itsown time without your feelings of guilt and inadequacy getting in the way. Loveyourself, be kind to yourself, and you will then be ready to love and be kind toothers.Forgive yourself when you fall below the ideals you seek, and you will find thatyou can forgive others when they act in ways that you don’t like. Forgiveness ofothers can only come after forgiveness of self."},{"pageContent":" 8A Little RespectThere are some who believe that without fear and guilt society would collapseinto chaos and anarchy. It is a perception that encapsulates the system’sperverse idea that you can only keep humanity in check by the imposition ofnegative emotions. The opposite is the case.I was once questioning the concepts of fear and guilt in a debate at the OxfordUnion when a student stood up and said that it was only fear and guilt,especially fear, that held society together. Without fear of retribution such asimprisonment, he contended, people would do even more awful things to each otherthan they do now. That student was articulating the thoughts of billions ofpeople around the world. I worked in a television department where it wasthought that the way to keep the staff working hard and conscientiously was tokeep them in a constant state of uncertainty and concern for their future. It isthe same in all areas of life. How many children are controlled by the fear ofparental violence?But surely if you build and seek to control a society through those mostpowerful of negative emotions, you will create a negative society. It will be asociety in which the negative will dominate thinking and belief-systems. Asociety, for example, that will concentrate on what we can’t do or are notallowed to do, rather than emphasising the limitless potential we all have.The idea that the controlling emotions of fear and guilt are irreplaceable is agigantic myth. They can be replaced and will be replaced in the years anddecades before us by the positive and self-balancing mechanism we call respect.That’s the key word of this time and the future. Respect for ourselves andrespect for everything. That is a positive foundation on which to build asociety, and on which to build our own personal outlook on life.I was in a radio studio a little while ago, waiting to be interviewed. Allmorning, apparently, they had been having a phone-in on the subject offox-hunting, and now I was listening to an interview with a wonderful man whohad gone out from England to Bosnia, in an effort to raise the money to rebuilda bombed orphanage. Three times in that chat, the interviewer made the pointthat now they were talking about an issue that really mattered, after spendingso much of the morning talking about fox-hunting. He clearly thought that thehorrors of fox-hunting were not as important as the horrors of Bosnia. But whatis the difference except in degree? The same state of mind, the same lack ofrespect for self and others, is behind both situations.Once you believe you can create a league-table of life-forms on the basis ofwhich are more important and worthy of respect than others, you are enteringvery dangerous ground. What is the difference, except where you draw your lineof expendability, between saying: “I can justify killing foxes for pleasurebecause they are lesser forms of life”, and saying, “I am a Bosnian Serb and soI can justify killing a Bosnian Muslim, because they are lesser forms of life”?If we treat animals badly, we’ll treat people badly. The same thought-patternsare responsible for both.So often I find that people don’t see they are behaving in the same way as thosethey oppose. There is no difference between the violence and pain a scientistforces animals to suffer in a vivisection laboratory, and the violence againstthe scientist by a tiny minority of extreme animal liberation activists.Violence is violence and begets more violence. It is the same thought-patternmanifesting. When I said this at a rally opposing vivisection, the vast majorityof the audience enthusiastically agreed because they knew this was so. But ahandful of people afterwards told me that one day they would hang me, because ifI was against violence on vivisectors I could not possibly care about animals!The word is respect. If we respect the rights of all life, if we see them all inthe terms that we see ourselves, and if we relate what happens to them with howwe would feel if it happened to us, we will begin to revolutionise the valueswhich pervade this planet. Respect for all life, no matter what form it maytake, will mean that the fox-hunter will cease to kill the fox and the Bosnianwill cease to kill other Bosnians who don’t share his culture, religion andethnic inheritance. The elimination of fear and guilt both within us and withoutwill be replaced by respect.Once you have respect for the Earth on a global scale (positive), you don’t needlegislation to say that you must not pollute beyond what the law allows(negative). If you respect all people of whatever colour or creed as equalexpressions of the One Consciousness (positive), you no longer requirelegislation to say that you must not discriminate against someone on the groundsof their colour or creed (negative).Fear and guilt create wars and conflict. Respect for self, and so the world,will make war impossible.But for this to happen, respect has to be a two-way process. Take the case ofthe people we in Britain call ‘new age travellers’, who wish to have a nomadiclifestyle going from place to place, living in their buses and caravans. Theyask others who don’t live like that to respect their right to have a differentlifestyle. Quite right, too. What arrogance to believe that, because societysays it’s ‘normal’ to live in a permanent dwelling, others who choose otherwiseare lesser human beings. What is missing is respect. Behind that abuse andcontempt for travellers is our old friend fear – the fear of something that isdifferent to the status quo, which so many see as their ‘security’. So I am onehundred percent behind the travellers’ right, and anyone else’s right, to livein the way they feel is good for them.But. It is clear, too, that there are elements – and only elements – withinthese travelling groups who, while demanding respect for their way of life, donot show a similar respect for others. They may see people who complain abouttheir behaviour as toffee-nosed, middle-class system-servers, but whatever theyare, they have a right to live their lives as they feel fit, too. They have aright not to be disturbed by loud music when certain travellers stop in theirarea, and they have a right not to see that area covered in rubbish. If respectwere the motivator behind both lifestyles, the conflict would disappear. Ifconventional lifestyles respected the rights of others to live differently, andvice versa, travellers and non-travellers could live in peace and harmony. Untilthat happens, the problems will go on.You are a sacred and special aspect of Creation, and every other aspect isequally sacred and special. Respect yourself for what you are, and you willrespect others for what they are.Now that’s a world I want to live in."},{"pageContent":" 9Judge and JuryNow we come to the most popular sport and pastime known to the human race:judging others. Under starters orders… and they’re off!“I think it’s absolutely disgusting that she’s got another man – and so soonafter her husband died, too.”“Have you seen what our neighbour looks like? What a tart!”“I think all people who run businesses are scum – all bosses exploit theworkers.”“Do you know that we now have some blacks in our street. It’s outrageous – theyare no better than monkeys in the trees.”That last judgment was actually said in my hearing. It’s amazing what we sayabout each other. But the system encourages us to judge – that is part of theway it controls. It goes even further and sets out how people should be judged,not even by what they are, but by what they own; not by how they care, but bywhat they wear; not by the size of their heart, but the size of their house.Possessions and income are the system’s measurements of success because it needsus to buy that delusion if it is to persuade us to buy all the otherpossessions, services and trinkets that it has to sell to survive.And yet real success in a physical lifetime is not the accumulation of money andpossessions, it is to find inner peace, contentment and happiness, and tocomplete experiences designed to speed our evolution. That may mean having alifetime with a small income and few or no possessions. Judging another’ssuccess by what they own is the height of misunderstanding, I would suggest.But what is the judgment of others in any form when you take it back to thelevel of self? It is an excuse, a diversion, which stops us looking at our ownbehaviour. While we are judging others and pointing out all the things we feelare wrong about them, we can ignore those things about ourselves that mightdeserve a little examination. It is also a way of protecting our ownbelief-systems. While we judge others constantly from the perspective of ourbelief system, we can avoid questioning and evolving what we believe. In otherwords, when we judge others, we are in danger of standing still. One of the mainmotivations behind judging others is the fear of looking at ourselves with aview to change.Humanity has become conditioned to view change with fear and trepidation. Thestatus quo does not want change except within strict limitations, becausesignificant change means, by definition, the end of the status quo. Given achoice, turkeys would not vote for Christmas or Thanksgiving. It’s the same withthe personal and collective status quo. Our security has ceased to come fromwithin ourselves – instead it has become outwardly expressed. Security hasbecome a ‘decent’ home, a ‘good’ job, an unchanging world around us, and theprospect of all three continuing into the future. We fear outward change becausewe fear change within ourselves. We resist it, and one way we do that is to takeour static ‘values’ and judge everyone and everything by those ‘standards’.[../Images/00011.jpg]Yet when we judge others, we are giving them permission to judge us – and wouldyour life stand up to scrutiny even if that judgment were based on the samecriteria and ‘values’ that you apply to people when you judge them?As I have said already, another big reason for judging others harshly is becausethey are reflecting back at us traits of our own behaviour, and that can reallymake us explode. Somehow we think that if we oppose those behaviour traits inothers, we can ignore that we ourselves have them, too. Only by accepting thatcan we take steps to change. But it is worth stressing that being honest aboutourselves, and seeing areas that we wish to develop and change is not the sameas judgment, just as questioning what happens in the world is not judgment ofpeople. Looking at ourselves honestly, but kindly, with understanding andcompassion, speeds evolution. Looking harshly and judgmentally at ourselves canhold back evolution. Judgment of ourselves is not the way. But constantlyquestioning the belief systems that control our behaviour is very necessary.I know there are a few people who see it as quite wrong for me to takeinformation into the public arena and challenge the system of life that we have.They see it as being judgmental. But what are they doing, by that samecriterion, except judging me? We could go around in circles here. By makinginformation available I am not saying that people have to believe it, only thatthey have a right to hear it along with the views of everyone else. To deny themthat right, would be to leave them to the imbalanced flow of information givento them by the status quo, which filters out anything that seriously questionsits own existence. What I am doing is not judging people, but challengingthought-patterns by showing that alternative ways of thinking and explaininglife do exist, contrary to what the status quo wishes us to believe. Judgementof people and the questioning of belief and behaviour systems are not the same.Without the questioning of thought-patterns, there is no evolution, either forourselves or the whole.What makes the judgment of other people, as people, most ridiculous is that wehave no idea why they are acting in the ways they are. It may be their free willand, if so, they will learn from it. But it could just as easily be anexperience pre-arranged to change our own view and awaken us to other potentialpossibilities and ways of thinking. We could well be making harsh judgmentsabout people who love us so much on higher levels that they are giving us anexperience designed to help our own evolution.Let us put an end to judgment of ourselves and others. Then, and only then, willloving unconditionally become possible."},{"pageContent":" 10The Great AwakeningAll that I have said has been designed to highlight how we are controlled bywhat comes in through the eyes and the ears, and how we can walk free from thatcontrol. From here on, I am looking at where people can go from that point ofunderstanding. The most common question I am asked is: “Okay, I accept the basisof what you are saying. What can I do now?” I will offer some answers in therest of the book, but only you can decide if they feel right to you.When our minds incarnate in each physical life, not all of the mind is subjectto the limitations of the physical body. Only some levels of the mind workdirectly through the brain. The higher levels of our consciousness, thesubconscious, super-conscious, etc, guide what I call the ‘physicalconsciousness’ through a series of life-experiences. It would be of no value ifthat part of our minds experiencing this physical level – the ‘physicalconsciousness’ – knew what it had come to experience and how it hoped to react.There would be no learning.The physical consciousness (lower self) experiences, and our higher levels(higher self) guides us through those experiences. At the end of each physicallife all becomes at one again, and all the experience and knowledge is absorbedby the whole.When we feel drawn to certain people and places, or when our intuition urges usto take a certain course of action, this is our higher self speaking to us inthought-energy being passed down from higher to lower levels. When we say ‘whata small world’ and ‘what a coincidence’, they are not coincidences at all. Theyare the work of higher selves making things happen so we can experience themwith certain other minds. This might be for karmic reasons, or because a taskneeds to be done for the benefit of creation. How we react to those situations,using our free will, decides the next stage of our lives. If we make a decisionthat the higher self considers inappropriate for our evolution we willconsistently find ourselves facing the same situation again and again, until wemake another choice. From that point the situation ceases to recur, and anotherstage opens up.How often do we go against our intuition and regret it? Over enormous amounts oftime, humanity has been sending out disruptive, negative thought-patterns(energies), as the programming has controlled our thinking. This has imbalancedthe energies within which we all live, and encouraged us to think and generateeven more negative energy. One major consequence of this has been that thecommunication channels between higher and lower selves during an incarnationhave been much less powerful amid this ocean of increasingly negative-dominatedenergy on this frequency. What comes in through the eyes and the ears – thesystem – has overpowered the messages coming down from higher levels ofourselves. In that one sentence you have the biggest reason why the planet is inthe state it is.One of the ways we have lost touch with our higher levels is that thepredominant propaganda to which our eyes and ears are subjected is telling usthat we don’t have higher levels, that they don’t exist. When we accept this,the connection with those levels is further reduced. What you don’t thinkexists, you don’t seek to reconnect with.But things are changing fast. Positive and balancing energies have been cominginto this frequency from other levels in ever greater power since the 1960s. Itwas they who awakened so many to another way of thinking which manifested itselfas the phenomenon called ‘flower power’. These energies were too much to handlefor many. People became ‘ungrounded’, and so the ideals of the 1960s lacked adirection that would bring about fundamental change at that time. In this decadeand beyond, it will be different. Those energies coming into this frequency tobalance the negative domination have been affecting more and more people throughthe 1970s and 1980s in ways that gave us the Green movement, the animal welfaremovement and the explosion in vegetarianism. Now as we move through this decadethe Great Awakening of humanity is upon us, as the interaction of negative andpositive energies quicken the vibrations around the earth.Already, all over the world tens and tens of millions are beginning to think,question, and see life in a new way. Soon it will be hundreds of millions andmore. There is a mass reconnection underway between lower and higher selves asthe energies around the planet become less disruptive to that connection. Thevery fact you are reading this book means that you are awakening.It is not even a case of having access to new information. What I have set outin my books and talks is merely to help people remember what they already know.This is why some people have their entire lives changed by one book or one talk.They have remembered what this imbalanced frequency and the illusions of thesystem have led them to forget: who they really are.The speed of this awakening can be increased if people make the decision to gowith the quickening vibrations and not resist them. There are many ways we canhelp ourselves to open up to a ‘new’ or, rather, re-emerging, understanding."},{"pageContent":" 11A Time to FeelYou will probably have come across the term ‘going within’.When someone not in the know asks “what can I do?”, and they are told “Gowithin”, they often find such advice confusing because they don’t know what itmeans. Linked to ‘going within’ is the word ‘meditation’, which again can be alittle daunting to people just turning their minds to these subjects. I preferthe description ‘sitting quietly’. This is an effective way of ‘going within’ –re-connecting with those higher levels of ourselves that hold all theinformation we need to overcome the illusions of the physical world, and do whatwe are here to do.It is when we sit quietly and let our minds and thoughts go wherever they wish,that we can hear, or most often, ‘feel’ our higher selves. I recommend it. Itcan be a wonderful feeling as you experience the energies around you and thelove that enfolds you. The more you do this, the more your sensitivity will beheightened, and the more powerfully you will feel these energies and sense whatyour heart and your higher self is saying to you.Amid the noise, clamour and self-imposed pressure of modern life, the ears andeyes will always dominate, at least at first. The time will come when you are sore-connected with your higher mind that even the distractions of noise, desiresand pressures will not get in the way. But if you are just awakening, it isimportant that you take time out to sit quietly without any agenda and justfeel. This is not an emotion as such, like anger, love or regret. It is more anintuitive feeling like we say ‘a gut feeling’. What you think can be affected byall manner of confusions. The most important indicator of your intuition and theurgings of the higher self is what you feel. What you think and feel can bedifferent. What you think is best for you might be what the system and yourprogramming wants you to think is best for you. What you feel is best – thatfeeling and urging from your heart and intuition will come from higher levels.They are the levels that really know what’s best for your evolution, even thoughthat might conflict with what your eyes and ears are telling you.‘Rational’ thought is not the only kind of thought worth the name. It is still‘rational’ to think that increasing production and consumption is the only wayto survive, when actually it is the quickest way to global oblivion. Such anidea is, in fact, the very definition of irrational. How can we take lectures onwhat is ‘rational’ from a system that is dismantling the world? Suspend yourjudgment on what is or isn’t ‘rational’, and allow what you feel to come to thesurface, no matter if it seems incredible in the face of what is considered saneby the system’s insane standards.If you have to make a choice between what you think and feel, follow what youfeel every time. The moment will come, as the re-connection into wholenessgathers pace, when what you think and feel will always be the same, because atthat point the whole wisdom of the mind will be channelled through the physicallevel. There will be no divisions. In the same way your higher mind will beseeking the most effective connection with the Infinite Mind of Creation. Whenyour physical level re-connects with your higher mind, and your higher mindfinds a powerful connection with the Infinite Mind, so much will be possible tounderstand and achieve that is beyond our comprehension today. That prospect isthere for you in this lifetime if you want it enough.People have written to me describing experiences while sitting quietly or evenwhen walking down the street, which have shown them the truth that we are allOne. A man wrote to describe how he was walking along when suddenly he felt partof everything. He was still the same consciousness, still the ‘person’ he hadalways been, but at that moment, he said, he was also the pavement, the houses,the cars, and the people walking past him. There was no division betweenanything. He was part of a seamless stream of energy.Sitting quietly and just ‘being’, without distractions, is a way we can raiseourselves to re-connect. There are many meditation groups (sitting quietlygroups!) which you may like to join or, like me, you may prefer to work on thisalone. It is up to each person to decide what feels right for them.Some take meditation very seriously, and it becomes everything. That is theirchoice and it may well be right for them. But sitting quietly is part of theprocess of awakening, that’s all. If we concentrate too much on one twig we maynot see that the twig is part of a forest that is waiting to be explored. To behonest, I have done very little sitting quietly compared with some, but it hasbeen valuable when I have. Again, follow your instincts. They will guide you todo whatever you need to do at this time.Follow those instincts and don’t deny them, and all will be well."},{"pageContent":" 12Getting TogetherThere is an ever-increasing array of groups and organisations aimed at expandingunderstanding and supporting each other, as the speed of the journey gets everfaster.What I have said about ‘isms’ does not mean I am against joining or working withsuch groups. I think they are essential so that people of like mind can findsupport and information, in a world that is still very sceptical, even hostile,to such thinking. Getting together in groups is very advisable, and I havelisted a few addresses at the back of the book for those who wish to contactsome of them. You might even decide to start your own group.The point I am making is that we need continually to follow our own instinctsand intuition, and while it is helpful to work with groups of people and listento what they say, those instincts must be the guide that decide our course ofaction, even if that means going against what every other person in the groupsays and believes. Getting together with others is a way of supporting andstimulating the interplay of feelings and ideas, but we ourselves must make thefinal decision, and have the confidence to go against the majority view, if weare to stop the group thinking for us and becoming a prison of the mind.Be careful also about feeling inferior in the presence of people whose awakeningbegan long before yours. I have heard many times what I call the ‘I’ve beendoing this for twenty years’ syndrome. This is the idea that if someone has beenworking in these areas for a comparatively long time, they must be further alongthe road of understanding and more in touch with their higher mind. That may beso, but just as easily it may not. Under that criterion every thirty year oldsportsman must be more talented than every twenty-one year old. This is clearlynot the case. Does every seventy-five year old have a better understanding oflife than every forty year old? No. The time spent working at something is onlyuseful if that time is used well. There are people whose experience you canlearn from, but time-serving in a subject is not, by itself, proof of trueunderstanding.Also, the time of awakening is no guide to someone’s evolution. It is likelythat the period of awakening was timed to fit in with a life-plan. I recallsomeone at a meeting telling me I was not as evolved as he because he had openedup to this subject years before. But that is irrelevant. How evolved we are orare not is the result of endless physical lifetimes and periods on otherfrequencies going back to the moment we first became conscious. There are mindsworking through the bodies of five month old babies today that are far moreevolved than those working through physical forms that have been on the planetfor eighty years. The age of the body in this life has nothing to do with amind’s eternal evolution. It is worth pointing out, too, that to go aroundsaying you are more evolved than someone else, to see yourself and others inthose terms, betrays anything but an evolved understanding. So I would saylisten to others and their experience without being intimidated by them.This brings us to channellers. We all have the ability to channel, which merelymeans to tune your consciousness to another frequency and allow thought-energyto be passed through your consciousness to this level. Here your lower self,through your brain, decodes the thought-energy and turns it into either spokenwords or what is ed automatic writing. Some people have fine-tuned this abilityand can do it more effectively than others, but not all those who callthemselves ‘channellers’ are gifted, just as not all footballers are Pele. Forevery Pele or George Best in the world of football, there are millions who playfor their local pub team on the park.Being less gifted than Pele at football is not a danger to others. If youclaimed to be a Pele it would take only a few minutes with a ball to see veryclearly that you were not. If only the same could be said of channelling! If Ihad to write the word beware only once in this book, it would be alongsidechannelling. As you seek and awaken, you will come across channellers andchannelled information about yourself and the planet. That’s fine and desirableif you are selective.The purest and most brilliant channellers are relatively few. To reach thatstage you need to have re-connected very closely with your higher self, andthrough that to the Infinite Mind. The number of those who have achieved that isinfinitesimal when contrasted with the number of people around today claiming tobe channellers. To have reconnected to such an extent means that the informationcan come through the lower self (by now at one with the whole self) with apurity and clarity that is not muddied by the ego and the emotions affected bythat ego.That is not to say that people who channel before they have reached this stateof being are to be written off. But the words they speak or write are likely tobe, at least to some extent, a less-than-perfect replica of the originalthought-energy that entered them at a higher level. I have found people who arefar too ready to believe and act upon information channelled by someone.Channellers can tend to be almost worshipped sometimes and seen as fountains ofknowledge, when this is often not the case at all. Setting up as a channellercan also be used, even unknowingly, as a means of manipulation. The informationthey speak or write is what they wish to happen, not necessarily what the otherlevel is sending. They can wreak havoc in your life if you are not careful.We would do well not to underestimate the determination of misguided,imbalanced, aspects of the One Consciousness to disrupt and destroy theawakening and transformation of humanity and planet earth, by usinginexperienced or less-gifted channellers to pass on utter nonsense. There are aninfinite number of frequencies in Creation, and not all of them are at the stagewe would call wisdom. As someone said: “Death is no cure for ignorance”. To whatlevel of consciousness is the channeller tuning? If it is to quite a low level,they might be telling you a load of disruptive, mind-scrambling, life-scramblingnonsense. One thing to avoid at all times is devices like Ouija boards, whichcan be vehicles for, shall we say, less enlightened levels.Let your feelings tell you what is right for you – be street-wise and selective.One good way is to listen to a number of channellers without telling them whatanyone else has told you. It is the same with tarot card readers and those whouse similar methods of communication. See what common themes emerge and look atthose rather than the detail, which can quite easily be distorted as thethought-energy passes through the levels of being.The good news is that as the awakening proceeds more people will bere-connecting with their higher levels, and the purity of channelling willincrease. But really channelling, in the sense of moving into a semi-conscioustrance, is only one way of bringing down information to this level, and I feelthis will gradually fade in the future. When you get closer to your higher selfin vibratory terms and become at one with it, you will find that you no longerneed to go to channellers except for perhaps confirmation of what you feel. Whenyou are ‘in sync’, information is passed down to you all the time.As I write this book I don’t go into a trance every time I sit at thetypewriter, but it is still being ‘channelled’ from a higher level of myself.Sometimes as I sit here the words pour through my mind at such a speed that I amhardly able to keep up with them on the keyboard. This entire book has beencompleted in less than a week. But it was not done in a channelling ‘mode’. I amsitting here feeling quite normal, and stopping every few paragraphs to chatabout the events of the day with Linda and sip a nice cup of tea! This is theway humanity will be communicating as the awakening goes on, I feel. There willbe no higher and lower self – only self, a self with a direct connection withthe Infinite Mind. This, I believe, is the real meaning of the constant themethrough the centuries in religions and legend, of ‘returning to the father’. Itmeans re-linking with the consciousness of all that is, and so tapping intoquite unbelievable knowledge, wisdom and potential.What a great time to be here!"},{"pageContent":" 13Lights in the SkyThere are many obsessions within the subject we are discussing that can divertus from continuing to seek, and so find.We can get hooked on channelling one aspect of consciousness all our livesinstead of raising our vibrations to tune to ever-higher levels ofconsciousness. We can become so obsessed with meditation that we do that at theexpense of making practical use of what we feel and understand at these moments.We can also get obsessed with one part of the transformation, like crop circles,and see them as ‘it’, rather than one piece in the puzzle. It is important thatwe continue to see each area of work and research as a component in a vastjigsaw and not as the entire picture.If we do this, each component part we come across can be a stepping stone to thenext, and so on until the whole picture begins to emerge. This is happening tomany people who became interested in a new way of thinking by trying to explainthe crop circle phenomena. Their research has led them on to an interest in UFOsand lights in the sky because of the sightings of such things in areas wherecrop circles and patterns have appeared. This, in turn, is leading people ontoother areas of research – into areas that reveal that some enormous change inplanetary consciousness is underway.[../Images/00001.jpg]We all come into this way of thinking at different points. With me it wasmeeting a medium, with others it is crop circles, with still others it isalternative healing or UFOs. From that ‘in’ point, however, it is necessary tospread out and look at all aspects if we are to gain a balanced and whole viewof what is happening and who we are.Until recently, I have not felt the need to look closely at the UFO phenomena. Iwas spending all my time working in other areas and doing other things. Thensuddenly information was coming at me from all angles about extraterrestrials,space people from other worlds. You will probably find this in your ownawakening. Apparently out of the blue, information about a particular subjectwill reveal itself through many different sources in a short time. It is clearthat someone is trying to tell you something: the moment has come to encompassthat knowledge into your overall view.The more I have opened my mind to the subject of UFOs and extra-terrestrials,the more I am convinced that this is a key component to understanding the natureof the current transformation of the planet and to appreciating what has beengoing on in the other realms, frequencies, in the struggle between light anddark, harmony and disharmony. This spiritual confrontation is now being workedout on this physical level today.My feeling is that there has been a fantastic struggle on other frequenciesbetween the forces of harmony and disharmony which has been portrayedsymbolically in films like ‘Star Wars’ and ‘The Empire Strikes Back’. I believemost strongly that films and books of this kind, and others like ‘ET’ and ‘CloseEncounters of the Third Kind’, are the result of knowledge seeping down into theconscious level of the writers. It appears as a science fiction story, but is inreality based on science fact – what they know on their higher levels hashappened on other frequencies.I believe that an aspect of consciousness decided that it would no longer followthe laws of Creation. These are not laws written down in a book, they are morelike the laws of physics – the laws you must follow for harmony to reign in thesea of consciousness that is Creation. This misguided aspect who decided tochallenge those laws we will call ‘Lucifer’. When you go against the naturalflows that bring harmony you of course create the opposite, disharmony. If youcan then understand how to harness that disharmony and negative energy, how tofeed off it and become stronger, you can begin to wreak havoc. You can sodestabilise other areas of consciousness that they become part of your way of‘thinking’ and add to your numbers.There came a time, I feel, when those who wished to preserve harmony decidedthat this Luciferian Consciousness had to be challenged. This was the so calledWar in the Heavens talked of in Revelations. Planets were destroyed, eitherdirectly by the forces of disharmony, or they influenced others to do it. Lookat what we have done to this planet, for instance, often in the belief that wewere trying to improve things. Has humanity been guided by a force for good inwhat it has done to itself and the Earth? Hardly. The same and worse hashappened on other planets to the point where they ceased to exist, sometimesexploding apart as a result of nuclear explosions. A great rift in the universeresulted and we are now seeing the process of restoring harmony once again.The Earth has for a long time been possessed and controlled largely by theLuciferian Consciousness and human evolution has been diverted as a result. Acall went out for volunteers on other levels who were willing to come to thisplanet and work for its restoration. This meant incarnating into a very hostilesituation among those under the control of the Lucifer Consciousness and thesevolunteers were constantly challenged by that consciousness while inincarnation. The man we call Jesus was one of those who volunteered and therewere many others. The necessary level of determination, courage, andunderstanding to do this job was, however, extremely high and the number ofvolunteers who proved capable of passing all the tests in many physicallifetimes to the point where they could be trusted with the responsibility ofplaying their role today was relatively small. Some say it was the 144,000referred to in Revelations. I don’t know about that, but I have no doubt thereare not that many compared with the population of the planet today, whichnumbers almost six billion.You can often identify these people – maybe in yourself – as those who havebeen, or are still going through, horrendously difficult experiences. They askquestions like: “Why am I going through this terrible experience when all I wantto do is work for the good of the planet?” Recognise that line? These are thefinal tests, the final honing and strengthening of the spiritual steel that isgoing to be necessary in the rest of this physical lifetime as the power of theLuciferian forces is removed from this planet and the collective mind ofhumanity is released from the prison these forces have helped to create. It wasthey that destroyed Atlantis and brought the disharmony here that has helped tode-link humans from their higher levels.Always when these volunteers have been in incarnation over the centuries theyhave been supported, often unknowingly, by what we call UFOs andextra-terrestrials. If you look at the Bible you will see many examples ofpeople describing spaceships. I know the idea that Jesus was helped byspaceships may sound daft to many, because they see the comparitively primitivenature of life in Palestine at that time in stark contrast to the breathtakingtechnology that would be required for space travel. But we need to remember thatwhat happens on Earth is only the point that it has reached in its ownevolution. Everywhere is not the same. Beings from other civilisations that arefar more advanced than us technologically, and from other more highly evolvedfrequencies, have visited the Earth and taken a close interest in its welfareever since the Luciferian consciousness took it over.Today, more than ever before, the Earth is surrounded on other vibrations bywhat we would call ETs, those from other planets, frequencies, and areas of thisuniverse who are playing their part in the cleansing of this planet and theremoval of the Lucifer influence. They and their craft have the ability toswitch frequencies, come to this one, and then return. When this happens a lightin the sky or a spaceship will apparently disappear when in fact it has merelyswitched to another frequency so it can no longer be seen on this one. UFOs canalso be seen through our psychic sight on other levels, and on these occasionsone person will see them while someone next to them will not. The sightings ofUFOs are growing by the year and there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that atthe highest levels of military intelligence, particularly in the United States,they know of their existence and have had contact with them. Many people whohave seen spaceships have been visited by the security services to be told tokeep quiet because they know the likelihood of public alarm resulting from arealisation of what is obviously true – that we are not the only life-forms inCreation.The time is approaching when these spaceships will land in the full view ofeveryone, but before that can happen human consciousness has to be prepared.This event would cause such a collosal explosion in the human belief system thatit would create tremendous mental and emotional upheaval. This is why it isbeing done in stages, a sighting here, a few more sightings there, films aboutthem that reach a massive audience, so that it dawns in the human consciousnessas smoothly as possible that we are not alone and, at least most of these shipscome in peace and love.This is not the case with all of them, however, and I think it is right toemphasise that. Just as there are misguided people on Earth, so there areelsewhere. I recall channelling some information once in relation to UFOs whichsaid: “Just because there are civilisations further ahead of you technologicallydoes not mean they are any more wise in how they use that technology”. I believethere are Luciferian-influenced visitations from some UFOs which do not have thebest interests of this planet at heart. There are some horrible stories ofabductions and the physical abuse of horses and other animals which I feel arethe work of such beings. These tales have stimulated a lot of fear about UFOswhich is unfortunate because it makes it harder for the majority to be acceptedfor what they are – beings that wish to love the Earth and humanity back tophysical, mental and emotional health. I feel that the contact the militaryintelligence services have had with UFOs and their occupants are of themisguided technology-without-wisdom evolution. But their days of creating fearand adversely affecting the Earth are coming to an end because harmony and loveare casting a shield of protection around this planet that will ensure that thetime of any Luciferian manifestation will soon have passed.If you are someone who has volunteered to play a part in the healing of theworld then you will be in some form of contact telepathically or through directchannelling with so-called ETs. There is a sort of mission control which iscoordinating this work and I know it is often referred to as Ashtar Command.What form it takes or what we perceive it to be is not important. Its effect iswhat matters. You will have been pre-programmed to awaken at the right time andyou will be protected as much as is possible from anything that will seek tostop you doing the work you have come to do. You are being watched every secondof your lives. Yes, even when you are doing that!UFOs, ETs and the whole cosmic question are going to be coming more and more tothe fore in the years ahead and we are going to realise that the very idea thatwe are alone in this universe is utterly ridiculous. What’s more, if we aregoing to heal the planet, we are going to need the help of those the systemdesperately wants us to believe don’t even exist."},{"pageContent":" 14Living in the PastAnother obsession I have found in some cases is that of past lives. It can bevery helpful to know something of your past incarnations because it can give youa better appreciation of what you are doing in this life, and why you have beenthrough certain experiences.Some people, however, get hooked on wanting to know who and what they have beenin the past. It becomes everything to them. I can understand this, especiallywhen you first begin to awaken. I remember I wanted to know everyone I had been!But you soon realise it is not necessary to know and, except in the terms I haveoutlined, of no importance. At various times I have been told by differentpsychics that my consciousness, my mind, had incarnations as the Greekphilosopher, Socrates, King Arthur, and that much misrepresented figure we callJesus. That must make me about the 20,000th person in incarnation today who hasbeen told he was Jesus!But even if that information about my previous incarnations were correct, sowhat? They, like all incarnations, are periods of experience. Those who haveincarnated as well known figures of history, have also had simple lives of allkinds in many civilisations, creeds, cultures and belief-systems. That is theonly means to evolve in a balanced way. You may well have incarnated as a famousfigure, but that could be no more or less important to you than another lifewhich history did not record. To talk of ‘us’ being someone in the past is verysimplistic, anyway. There is a little more to it than that, I think.When I have spoken at public events, some sensitive people in the audience haveseen figures around me. It happens often. On some occasions they will see NorthAmerican Indians, on others a Roman Orator, and, when I am questioning religion,a religious figure or a nun! I feel these ‘figures’ are the manifestations ofprevious incarnations that come forward when I need to use what I learned inthose lifetimes. Previous incarnations are like a bank or library of experiencewhich we can then call on at any time. If Socrates was an incarnation of myconsciousness, I have no doubt that I have been tuning into that part of my‘library’ for some of the philosophy in this book. That doesn’t make me‘special’. Everyone is the same. It is not what we have been or have done thatmatters most. It is what we are and are doing today. Now. This second.Alongside research into relevant past incarnations comes astrology. This, too,can give us a basic idea of what we have come to do, and the area to work on inthis life. The planets send out certain vibrations, thought-patterns, and so atany one moment, depending on where the planets are, some of those vibrationswill be more powerful around the earth than others. At the second we are born weinherit the energy-pattern in the environment around us at that time. Thisbirth-chart pattern will then interact with planetary movements through our lifein a different way to someone born at another time, when they would haveinherited a different energy-pattern at birth.By the skilled reading of where the planets were at your birth, a goodastrologer can give you a fair idea of the main outline of why you are here thistime. This they can see by the energies you have chosen to absorb at birth,because those energies will have been selected by you to give you the bestopportunity to complete your life-plan successfully. An astrologer can alsoadvise you on when it is best to do certain things.They will see when the energies most appropriate to a situation will be at theirmost powerful within and around you, as your energy-pattern is triggered by themoving planets. It is worth going to see an astrologer to add to your knowledge,but again, remember there are skilled astrologers and there are those who merelycall themselves astrologers. Finding someone through personal recommendation isthe best way."},{"pageContent":" 15The Long and Winding RoadOne of the first communications I was given when I visited my first psychic was:“The spiritual way is tough, and no one makes it easy”.They were not kidding!It is tempting to think, when you open yourself to this wonderful new vision andunderstanding of life, that everything will be easy from then on. Well it willand it won’t – if that doesn’t sound too daft. It depends at what level you aretalking about. Life can get very much harder on some levels, particularly in thefirst periods of awakening.You will be taking on board powerful positive energies – tuning in to higherlevels of knowledge and wisdom, and resynchronisation with your higher self is,by itself, an extremely positive experience. If you are to stay grounded andbalanced and not float off in a spiritual dream, this positive energy needs tobe balanced by negative. More than that you need the interplay of positive andnegative energies for evolution to take place. Life will not become free ofnegative experience. What will happen is that negative experience will cease toaffect you in the way it has in the past. True peace is not freedom from hassle– it is being unaffected by that hassle!In the three years after my own conscious ‘activation’ in 1990 enormous amountsof quite incredible positive energy were pouring into my energy-field, butaround me on the physical level I was going through some equally incrediblenegative experiences. One was there to balance the other, and the power of thepositive and negative interaction launched me like some spiritual space-shuttle,to a whole new understanding. Parts of this experience were sheer joy. Otherswere horrible. Both were necessary.The term ‘go with the flow’ is most appropriate. It is like riding a spiritualsurf-board on a tide of energy taking you in a certain direction. It can be abumpy ride, and you have to work hard to stay on your feet, but it is so mucheasier than trying to surf against the tide. Life on this level can be toughwhen you follow your higher self, because what you say and do will becomeincreasingly out of step, at least initially, with the rest of society. You willbe guided by a different set of principles and understandings.I don’t, however, wish to paint a picture that pain and anguish is a guaranteedpart of your future. I can say from what I have been through myself that themoment comes when what would once have been felt as a negative, painful,situation can be coped with in a way you would never have thought possible.Also, as the planet is re-balanced, the scale of negative experience will beginto diminish anyway. The more you have the confidence to be true to yourself andleave behind your worries of what other people think of you, the fewer negativesituations there are to affect you as you get closer to balance. Most pain andemotional trauma comes in the earlier stages of the awakening process, while youare still affected by the ‘values’ the status quo imposes on people, and peopleimpose on each other. You will find that negative experiences will be taken inyour stride as merely another experience on the road to enlightenment.You may think many things that turn out to be less-than-accurate, but that doesnot necessarily mean you misinterpreted the information. Sometimes thought-formswill be sent to you from higher levels which, while not strictly true, lead youto act in a way that your life-plan demands. For instance, at a time when I knewlittle about a character called the Count St Germain, I saw a leaflet in Franceadvertising a tourist attraction called Le Chateau de St Germain. Now there aremany places in Normandy called St Germain, and I would not have taken muchnotice had I not had the impression that this chateau was the former home ofCount St Germain. As a result I went along to see it. The chateau was not thehome of the count, but merely named after the local village. The point was,however, that my misunderstanding led me there, and it turned out to be animportant point on the earth’s energy system, which I have visited several timessince.Symbolism is another essential form of communication you will begin toexperience. You will see things in your everyday life that strike you assignificant, but you won’t know why. Symbolism is the universal language ofCreation, and part of its value is to encourage you to expand your consciousnessby trying to work out the meaning for you of the symbolism you see. If we weregiven all the information we needed on a piece of paper from on high, answeringall our questions, it would have little effect on our vibratory state. It is theseeking which expands the mind. So if you keep seeing the same situation orobject, or you see a sign or word that really hits you, try to open your mind towhat its significance could be. What are they trying to tell you?You are likely to think and do some strange and funny things when you begin toopen up. In another book, I have likened this to a bowl of calm water. When youturn on the tap, the calmness is disturbed until the tap is on full, and thewater is thrashing around in chaos, turmoil and confusion. When the tap isturned off, the calmness returns, but now at a much higher level in the bowl.When your physical consciousness, the lower self, frees its blockages and opensitself to higher levels, you are a little like that symbolic bowl of water.Energies come into your energy-field, and it can be stirred up to causetemporary chaos, turmoil and confusion. You are switching levels ofunderstanding, often with great speed, and your whole view of life, security,everything, crumbles before your eyes. This can be very traumatic for you andthose around you. This psychology of change is something that needs urgently tobe addressed and understood. So many are going to be affected by it as themonths and years unfold. We are going to see relationships breaking up becauseone person is not tuning into the changes like the other. But we will also seerelationships getting ever-stronger when both partners awaken together.If you are going through this awakening now, or you know someone who is, the keyword is balance. Keep thinking balance. Negative-positive and spiritual-physicalbalance. I think a good way to avoid great extremes at these times is to usewhat I describe as the ‘backburner principle’. As the energies flow into yourenergy-field, they are going to be carrying large amounts of ‘new’ information,and you are not going to be able to process it all and put it into perspective.Some of these energies will carry the memories of past events on earth,especially those which had a big effect on the human mind. You might findyourself believing you were anything from Adolf Hitler to the Virgin Mary. Youmight be travelling all over the place because the pendulum you are using forcommunicating with other levels swings a certain way to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ toyour questions. Yet later you realise that the pendulum is lethal in unskilledhands – it so easy to affect the swing with your own thought-patterns.My advice, having been through this awakening in a massive and very public way,is to use the backburner principle. Take the information you are sensing, andany you might receive through channellers or other sources, and let it simmeraway at the back of the stove before you leap into action. Appreciate that yourenergy-field is like that bowl of water, and many things will come into yourconsciousness that need to be allowed to simmer for a while, until they mix withother ingredients and information to give you something like a true picture.This will help you to avoid some of the extremes, but I should emphasise that ifexperiencing those extremes is part of your life-plan, as it is with me, thennothing I or anyone else says to you will make any difference. It will happen.The more you re-connect with your higher mind, the more easily the higher mindcan override the conscious level, to ensure that a life-plan experience takesplace. This is why we get ourselves into situations and ask: “How did I get intothis – why didn’t I see this coming?” The answer is we were not meant to. Ourconscious level is switched off, hypnotised, you might say, so that it cannotsee what is approaching, and so cannot take action to avoid something it haschosen before incarnation. The lower self has the free will to resist this, butthe higher levels know what we have chosen to experience, and they will do allthey can to make that happen. This inner conflict between lower and higher cancreate serious physical or emotional problems sometimes.I have talked at length about negative-positive balance, but equally importantis the male-female, spiritual-physical balance. We have chosen to come intophysical incarnation, and we do ourselves and others no favours if we then tryto ignore that we have done so. Some people become so obsessed with thespiritual that they cease to be grounded, anchored, on the physical plane. Theirconsciousness spends as little time as possible on this level, which means theirpotential to contribute to what needs to be done in a practical way is very muchreduced. This is just as imbalanced as being unable to see beyond the physical,and laughing at the very existence of the spiritual. It is balance we are after.[../Images/00002.jpg]My advice is to find at least one major thing in your life that is very much onthis physical level, so that it balances your spiritual expansion. With me ithas been football. I take time to forget all about channelling and other levelsand play, watch, or discuss football or any other sport. We need to live in thisworld as well as tune into higher levels. I have met scores of people who haveonly one topic of conversation – the spiritual, in whatever form. That is allthey have in their lives, all they wish to talk about. There are those who saythey never watch the television or the news, and they rarely mix with anyone whodoesn’t share their basic view. But how can we help others and relate what wesay to the daily lives of others, if we know nothing about what is happening inthe world outside our own belief system?Balance, balance, balance, in all things. Nothing is black and white. Everythingis made up of a range of colours.The most effective way to maintain balance and perspective is to have a sense ofhumour. Laugh! Laugh at yourself and feel good about laughing at yourself,because you have that self-confidence. Some of the situations we get ourselvesinto in this business can be hilarious. I have known UFO watchers look into thesky and say a UFO is approaching, and trying to make contact, only for the UFOto be a hand-glider or helicopter! If we take ourselves too seriously, that is alack of balance also.One thing that comes over constantly from the higher levels is their sense offun. I was standing at a sacred energy site once, after some amazing energychannelling. I was starting to feel very hungry. It had been an event of greatpower and reverence, but immediately it was over I was shown a vision of thebuffet bar at Salisbury railway station, with a cup of tea and a doughnut! Itook the hint, and the doughnut was superb.A sense of humour protects you from disruption by negative influences. If youdon’t retain a positive outlook, the fear of ‘dark forces’ can take you over andbecome a dangerous obsession. Yes, there are misguided, highly imbalanced,aspects of consciousness trying to destroy the planet, and the universe with it.Their thought-patterns will try to disrupt you, especially in the awakeningperiod. But if we fear them and become obsessed with them, we simply attractthem. I have met people who thought everyone they came into contact with, whodisagreed with their beliefs, was under the influence of ‘the other side’. Infact, if anyone is under influence of negative thought-patterns, it is theybecause they see the world and other people only in negative terms. If you thinkthat way, you surround yourself with those energies. I have seen this obsessiondestroy many lives and crush much potential for positive action. Fear of anykind affects the connection with the higher levels, and humour and laughter canprevent this.The more you relax and go with the flow that is guiding you, the easier it allbecomes. You no longer have to stand there anxiously with a pendulum asking whatto do next. Your intuition is so well tuned to the flow of energies that yousimply ‘know’.Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Our thought-patterns create our ownreality. If we think life is to be endured, that is what it will feel like. Butsurely life is to be enjoyed. Think that, and it will be so."},{"pageContent":" 16Thinking as OneWe have come a long way since the opening line of this book, and yet the groundwe have covered has almost entirely been about self-healing, freeing ourselvesfrom the programming, and opening up to a new vision.The title may be Heal The World, but without all I have outlined so far, playinga part in healing the planet is not possible. Now we are at the stage whereself-healing should be well underway, and we can look at how we can directly usethis knowledge and thinking to help Mother Earth.Every species has a collective mind, and humanity is no different. At some levelthe minds of what we call the human race – all those in incarnation – areconnected. At an even higher level, all species are connected, and at thehighest level everything is connected to everything else. This is seen, forexample, through what is called the Hundredth Monkey Syndrome. It has been shownthat once a certain number of a species learns to do something new, suddenly therest of the species can do it without ever being shown. This is possible becausethe learning, the information, experienced by a certain number, is enough toaffect the collective mind of that species and to become available to all ofthem. This is one of Creation’s most important truths.It is crucial in understanding how to heal the earth, and why the earth needs tobe healed. The damage to the mind of the planet is caused by negative anddisruptive thought patterns being generated by the collective mind of humanity.These negative patterns are being added to with every thought of every humanbeing who thinks the way the system wants them to think.The collective mind – ‘public opinion’, you might say – is dominated by thethought-patterns that illusions coming in through the eyes and ears haveprogrammed ‘individual’ minds to create. These thought-patterns (energies) atthe collective level have in effect declared war on the mind of the EarthSpirit. She has become so overwhelmed by this bombardment that her mental andemotional levels have been destabilised. As a result, the balance she brings tothe physical planet and sends out to the universe and beyond has becomedestabilised.We can see the effect in a dying planet, in the inability of the Earth torestore and repair in the way she once could, in growing extremes of weatherand, as seems highly likely in this decade, in some mind-blowing geologicalactivity. The physical Earth is not going to be allowed to die. It is the heartchakra, the balance point and source of the energy called love, for at least asignificant area of this universe. Already the imbalances have been exported toa wider area of Creation, and for the Earth to go out of incarnation would havehighly negative knock-on effects in this frequency and in at least those closeto it. The question is not “Is the Earth going to survive?”. She is. The realquestion is this: “How much of humanity will survive the changes necessary toprotect the planet?”.That is our choice and ours alone.As the energies around the earth increase in their vibrations there will be asort of filtering effect. Those who stay at the level where theirthought-patterns continue to add to the imbalances of the collective mind willfind themselves falling out of synchronisation with the gathering vibrationsaround them. Only by changing and expanding the way they think will they be ableto stay with the rising vibrations. There will be those who choose not to, andthis will, in the short term, lead to more negative behaviour. But before toolong the difference between their vibratory state and that of their environmentwill be so wide that their physical body will be unable to take it any longer.They will go out of incarnation.This is not punishment because they are ‘bad’ people. It is that the Earth ismoving to a higher vibratory state – frequency – and at this stage in theirevolution they have been unable to go with her. Those minds will move to anon-physical frequency, and continue their journey at a level suited to them. Noone can say what number this will involve. That is the decision that all peoplehave to make for themselves. I stress that not all those who go out ofincarnation will be ‘out of sync’. Many will have chosen this time to departeven before they came.Others who awaken will have the opportunity to expand their consciousness alongwith the Earth and go with her to the higher level she is destined to enjoy. Buteven then, it will require us to keep moving and seeking constantly, becausethis transformation is now going into higher and higher gears. It is speeding upwith every month.Everyone who awakens and begins to think positively and with a new awarenesswill be affecting the collective mind of the human race. So when I am asked bypeople “What can we do? What effect can one person have?”, I reply “You canchange the world”. By changing your thinking you cease to be part of theproblem, as you stop generating destructive thought-patterns and you become partof the solution by sending out healing thought-patterns. Every time another mindmakes that change we are getting closer and closer to that point when thedominating pattern of the collective mind switches from judgment and destructionto balance and love. When that moment comes, the way that humanity thinks as awhole will change with a speed that will make the period of change in the formerSoviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries seem pedestrian.That itself was an example of the collective mind of those countries beingtransformed. Once a certain number of people had realised that the so-calledpower of this communist empire was nothing more than an illusion, and that itwas only there because the people allowed it be there, events happened veryquickly. The switch of perception in collective consciousness brought peopleonto the streets, which then changed the perception even more, and so on.Eventually, in a period that would have been laughed at only weeks before, theapparently all-powerful Soviet empire came out with its hands up. The same isgoing to happen to the Western system of mind control on a global scale.The effect of the information and thinking that the awakening is presenting tous is so powerful in the face of the illusions of the physical world, that itwill not take fifty-one percent or even nearly that number to change theirthought-patterns, for those illusions to be overturned within the collectivemind. It will actually take comparatively few.So another way of healing the planet is to pass on what you know and haveexperienced to others, and allow them to see that there are other views andexplanations that the system has been denying them, for its own survival. Havethe courage to speak out for what you believe, to anyone who wishes to listen.If some people turn away from you then that’s their decision. Why should you beheld back and controlled by what they think? We can now all have access to aprinting press – the photocopier – which can network information inever-expanding circles, like dropping a pebble into a pond. Pass information toothers and ask each of them to print copies and pass them on to their friends,with the same request. Those sheets of information will also carry thethought-patterns that created them and this will affect people who are ready toawaken, too.All I would say about this is, respect everyone’s right to reject what you say.Forcing views upon people has no significant effect on raising their vibratorystate. They have to make that decision themselves. Take every opportunity youcan to speak or to write in the media, be it letters to local papers, takingpart in phone-ins, whatever it may be, and more people will realise there is awhole new and glorious way of looking at life. Get involved. This is a time inopt in, not out. Start in your own community and take it from there. Everysingle one who changes their thinking in the light of what you do will speed theday when the ‘big switch’ occurs in the collective mind of the human race."},{"pageContent":" 17The Web of LifeChanging the way people think and feel is fundamental to earth healing, but itis not the only way.If you know anything of acupuncture, you will be aware that the physical bodyhas a series of energy-lines known as meridians. These go all around the bodylinking in with the chakra vortex-points to maintain the flow of life-forceenergies to the physical level. When these energy-lines are balanced andfree-flowing the body is healthy. But when all is not well in the energy-system,the body is ill or diseased.It is the same with the planet.All over the earth on the unseen, sub-atomic level is a web of energy-lines andchakra points, and this system has been devastated by the lost understanding anddestructive thought-patterns of humanity. Before Christianity, knowledge of thissystem was widespread. But the emerging Christian creed saw these energies andthe acupuncture points along them as ‘evil’, because they were held sacred bypeople they believed to be heathens and savages.Ironically, in an effort to suppress what they felt were evil energies, theybuilt most of their early churches on important acupuncture and chakra pointsaround the world. The legends and myths about St George defeating the dragonrelate to the suppressing of these energies. The Chinese, I understand, stillrefer to this energy-system as dragon lines. I call them meridians, or as theyare also widely known, ley-lines. The churches have indeed helped to weaken theflow of energies because of all the disruptive thoughts of fear and guilt thatdominate so many religions, while those who have worshipped with love and joy intheir hearts have strengthened the energies.Some energy-sites are obvious because they are stone circles, like Stonehengeand Avebury, or mounds like Silbury Hill and high points like Glastonbury Tor.You also have natural energy-sites such as Uluru (Ayers Rock) in Australia, androck formations in places like Arizona in the United States. They are all overthe planet. Standing stones are like acupuncture needles balancing the flow ofenergy. Stone circles can be a sort of electrical circuit receiving energiesinto the system or boosting their power like an electrical coil.There are many thousands of people, perhaps millions worldwide, being guided byhigher levels to repair this system. You can join them. Use your free will totell your guiding consciousness that you want to help, and if that is part ofyour life-plan things will begin to happen.The system can be restored by balancing destructive thought-patterns which blockthe flow of energy along the lines. You can do this by sending out positivethoughts at these places, and these can be even more powerful if you visualisethe negative blockage dispersing and the energy of love flowing again. Open upyour heart and visualise the flow of love pouring from your heart chakra intothe system, and the imbalances melting away. Don’t underestimate what yourthoughts can achieve. As you become more sensitive you will feel the entireatmosphere around you change on these occasions.[../Images/00009.jpg]These energy lines are, like everything else, lines of consciousness. Thereforethey are affected by other consciousnesses. If they are bombarded by negativethought patterns their natural balance and flow will be affected becausedisharmony does that. On the other hand if you can go to these spots inreverence, love and respect, and send out thoughts of harmony, balance and love,then that will help to remove the imbalance and allow the energies to flowsmoothly again. You can do this alone or with as many people as you like. If youhold hands in a circle to make a sort of electrical circuit, the collectivepower of your thoughts and energies will be far greater than the sum of theparts. It often helps to concentrate the thoughts if someone paints a wordpicture, a visualisation, for people to focus on during these occasions. Itmight be that they ask you to picture in your minds the site surrounded by darkenergy and then ask you to visualise that energy dispersing and the whole areabeing bathed in bright, pulsating, golden light, with the energies flowingagain. All this is happening on the non-physical levels, the levels ofconsciousness and thought. What you think in these moments is what you create,especially if you are a particularly powerful consciousness or many people dothis together. You can change the whole nature of an energy site. In the sameway there are those controlled by the Luciferian Consciousness who go to thesesites to do exactly the opposite – generate disharmony. I don’t know if you haveever been to a place where black magic and ‘devil’ worship has been going on,but my goodness you can feel the extreme negative energy thus generated. We cando the same for the Light to counteract that.I say go to these sites in reverence and respect because they are aconsciousness also. They are in awareness and recognise those who have respectfor them and the laws of harmony, and those who do not. Nor is this a one-wayprocess as I have said before. When we visit these places there is an energyexchange going on. We can help to heal their disharmony, but our interactionwith their consciousness can activate many things within us that can help toawaken our memory and give us access to information held in the consciousness ofthese sacred places. Go to Glastonbury Tor and the other great sacred sites ofthe World and you can feel their knowledge and wisdom. If you are there for theright reasons, they will share that with you. It will reveal itself as the days,weeks, and months pass, as a knowingness, an understanding you cannot explain.You may not make the connection between that and your visit to a sacred place,but often that is where the knowledge was passed to you at a deep level fromwhere it could begin its journey to becoming conscious. Sometimes that canhappen immediately, while you are still at that place.It is more effective if you are at a site, but you can even do this from home ifyou concentrate on a place, maybe with a picture of it to help yourvisualisation. I know it sounds incredible that you can restore energy-linesfrom home, but all you are doing is broadcasting a thought-pattern to that pointto balance the one already there. When you turn on your radio it receives theradio broadcast signal, even though it might have been transmitted from anothercountry. You are the same – a broadcasting transmitter with legs! There is noneed to worry or think yourself inferior if you can’t feel or sense theseenergies to begin with. When I started I went around with two people who stoodthere saying: ‘Oh, feel these energies, they are really powerful’. I stood nextto them thinking: ‘I can’t feel anything. Either it’s me, or they are winding meup!’. Today I can sense and feel energies immediately.Besides repairing energy-lines and removing blockages, there is a need to bringin energies from other frequencies. The energies that are awakening the worldmust be passed through a physical form, or at least what is known as the ethericbody, which is the next level up from the physical. This has to happen if theenergies are to be changed into a form that the earth can absorb. It is likepassing them through a transformer and changing one form of current intoanother.The more people who awaken and raise their vibratory state, the more energy cancome in. If they passed energy through you that was beyond your own vibratoryrate, it could be a little like walking into a laser beam. It would do you andthe earth no good at all. But if you are willing to undertake this work,energies can be passed through you at an ever more powerful vibration, as youyourself raise your frequency. There is often no need to even know this ishappening, although as you become more sensitive you will be aware thatsomething is going on. At its most powerful, it can be likened to being pluggedinto the mains.In fact I have had some experiences in Peru, the United States, and Britain,that have been more like being plugged into a power station. In Stonehenge onthe night of 26th/27th July 1993, I was in a circle of people holding hands inthe way I have described to make an electrical circuit. They had all been drawnthere by a belief that they needed to be in the Henge that night. Some had comefrom the United States. It was around midnight and suddenly I was hit by themost incredible energy. It was as if a massive bolt of electricity had struckme. My body arched backwards as I grunted and tried to stay upright. I couldfeel a surge of power building up inside me and as it came to the surface Ifound myself letting go what one of those who heard it called a ‘primordialroar’. It came from the very depths of my being.Another burst of energy just as powerful followed. My great friend, Yeva, whohad organised the gathering that night, said she felt I should leave the circleand lie down on a rock that I always feel drawn to in Stonehenge. There, withYeva alongside, another five bolts of collosal energy hit me. I thought on twooccasions that I was going out of incarnation, such was the power – but you arenever given more than you can handle on these occasions, you will be relieved tohear! I had no idea exactly what was happening, but the next day we began tohear stories of power cuts in some areas not far from Stonehenge that night.Clocks stopped for an hour and people reported losing their late nighttelevision. Others said how they had seen a vortex of energy over Stonehenge atthe relevant time, while still others a few miles away described seeing a brightlight in the sky which suddenly exploded in all directions, lighting up thecountryside as if it was daytime.Perhaps the most astonishing part of that night involved a group of people inthe United States who knew of the event being organised in Stonehenge. They hadgone to a site in the States at exactly the same time all this was happening inthe Henge. They too saw a vortex of energy spiralling above them. Then suddenlytheir silence was broken by a massive roar apparently coming from nowhere. Theylooked around to see what it could possibly be. They could find no explanation.I tell this story because it is easy to wonder if it is all imagination when yougo to energy sites. Am I really feeling anything? Do these energies reallyexist? Am I just kidding myself? I have heard these questions many times fromthose just moving into these areas of thought and I understand why they saythat. They are fighting against indocrinated belief systems with apparently nophysical ‘proof’ to support what they are doing. But these energies are real.The energy grid of the Earth is real. The need for as many people as possible towork with them is real. There is so much that humanity does not understand aboutthe potential of harnessing these energies and the importance of theirrestoration to the future health and harmony of this planet.We should remember also that this energy grid spans the world. Energy lines andpoints are everywhere. You don’t always have to go to obvious sites likeStonehenge, Avebury, or Ayers Rock. There may be energy lines going through yourhome. Any place that you are drawn to is likely to be an energy point which haslong been forgotten as myth has taken control of human understanding. I havechannelled energies into the Earth in the centre of big cities many times. Itdoesn’t half give passers by a laugh, I can tell you!If your conscious level is willing to do this work, your intuition will begin toguide you, wherever you are in the world. As we repair the system and bring inthe higher energies the transformation of the Earth and humanity will gatherpace very quickly. There are certain times when planetary sequences are mostbeneficial, and energy-channelling is coordinated all over the planet at thesame time. This then brings big changes as those energies take effect.The most significant energy is the one known by many as the Christ. This is nota person, but an energy. It is pure love. Some say love is positive, some say abalance of negative and positive. I believe that the energy called love and itshighest expression, the Christ, is all of them. It is whatever it needs to be.If a situation needs negative energy to achieve balance, then love and theChrist will be negative. If balance is required, it will be balanced. Ifpositive energy is needed, love will be positive. It is whatever a mind, planet,frequency or situation requires. It is the great transformer of understanding,the balancer. The Christ energy is the ultimate manifestation of unconditionallove on this planet.The one we call Jesus could channel this energy, and perhaps it was from thispoint that it was given the name ‘the Christ’, as in Jesus Christ. But that mindis not the only one who can channel this energy.It is within the potential of at least a large number in incarnation today. Butthey need to reach a certain vibratory state before that can happen, otherwisethey will be fried by its power. I believe this was the energy that zappedthrough me in Stonehenge that night.The last major inflow of the Christ energy was around two thousand years ago inIsrael, because that was the most appropriate place for it to come in at thattime. It entered an energy-pattern in the area known as Jerusalem. Today itsmain place of entry into the world is a different energy-pattern. The ‘NewJerusalem’ is England. The most significant area is a triangle of land linkingGlastonbury Tor and points in Warwickshire and Hampshire. This is the heartchakra of the planet, from where love will pour in and out and change this worldforever. It is no ‘accident’ that so many ancient sites are enclosed by thistriangle, or that this is the crop-symbol capital of the world, and I feel thispattern connects with another of great importance in Normandy, going across toParis. But the Christ and your own love can be channelled into the systemanywhere. England is the main area, I feel, but not the only one. The world iscovered in energy sites. North America alone has a network of immensely powerfulsacred places.Every day we can help to heal the Earth by taking a few minutes to sit down anduse our consciousness to visualise her being healed, the darkness giving way toLight and love. You can do it at home, on the train, in the park, anywhere. Themore people who do it with you the better. You can join groups like FountainInternational who seek to get people together for Earth healing work – and I’veput their address in the back of this book. Healing the divisions and pain ofhumanity is the same process, be it caused by war, famine, or prejudice.Visualise the situation changing to a positive outcome and that pattern will beprojected to that area to check the imbalances that are causing the problem. Themore who choose to do this, of course, the more effective it will be.Think love, send out love, and you will be healing the world."},{"pageContent":" 18Over to YouYou might have noticed that I have said at several points ‘don’t do this’,‘avoid that’ and variations on this theme. That is merely to overcome the needfor endless repetitions of ‘In my experience…’ and ‘My advice is…’.For what you have read is not there to be followed unquestioningly. What youhave read is what I feel is right. If you don’t feel good about some of it, oreven all of it, fine. In the end I don’t know what is best for you – only youknow that. But I hope that it will help people to avoid problems which it is notnecessary for them to experience. This book is a classic confirmation that whatappear at the time to be highly negative experiences do have a positive effect.I can only write in the terms I have set out before you, because of what I havebeen guided through since 1990.Have I experienced some of the ‘pitfalls’ I have highlighted? No. I haveexperienced most of them!For the first three years after my awakening became conscious, if I wasn’tclimbing out of one spiritual trap, I was in the process of falling into thenext. All this was preplanned, so that I could point them out to others on thebasis of my own experience. This is far more powerful than getting thingssecond-hand from a book or a ‘teacher’. As a communication said when I was inthe depths of despair:“How can you help others if you have not been through it yourself?”We are in a period of human and planetary change, in which the Earth Spirit andall forms of life will need all the help, love and support they can get. Butmost of all, they will need the confidence and courage to listen to that quietvoice called intuition, and follow what it is saying, no matter what theirconscious thoughts may be thinking. It is worth repeating: if it is a choicebetween thought and feeling – feeling is the one to follow. That comes from theheart, that source of love, and from the higher levels of your ownconsciousness.It is that intuition that will guide you to where you need to be, and what youneed to do at this point of fantastic transformation. Everything is going tochange – eventually even the nature of the physical body. Amid the chaos as theold order crumbles, you, too, will feel lost and sometimes fearful and confused.Others around you will feel the same. During these moments listen to your heart,and let it guide you. If you have a life-plan that involves you going throughthis transformation and helping to build the new and glorious tomorrow, thenthat is what will happen – if you follow your instincts and refuse to allowothers to divert you.The future is not pre-ordained. When people ‘see’ the future, they are, Ibelieve, tuning into the energies, thought-patterns, that hold the projectedfuture. It is a future that will be, only if humanity does not change in itsthinking now. We are creating the future with every thought. If we as acollective mind cease to batter the Earth Spirit with negative thought-patterns,or reduce the rate at which we are doing that, then she will more quickly regainher mental and emotional balance. This will result in a more comfortabletransformation. The geological activity will be less catastrophic, changes inthe weather will be less extreme, and there will be less conflict, war andnegative behaviour of all kinds. If we continue on the path humanity hasembarked upon, and remain largely under the influence of the status quo, thescale of all of those things will be simply awesome.[../Images/00010.jpg]I feel that the awakening is already having an effect on reducing the impact ofsuch events, but as things stand there will still be upheavals on all levelsthat will defy our imagination. It is in our hands, or rather our hearts, toreduce them still further. What I have said in this book is, I feel, the basison which everyone can play a part in that.On a practical level, everyone can reduce as much as possible the impact theyare having on the Earth. The Green movement has many publications that canadvise you on how to live in a way that is least harmful to the planet. It willnot be environmentally friendly at this time – it will be less environmentallycruel. Ahead of us, however, is the knowledge of how to create through thought,in a way that allows total harmony between humans and the earth.We are going to realise as the frequency rises and higher levels ofconsciousness become available to us that what we see as state-of-the-art todayis really primitive. Take energy for warmth and power. All we are doing istaking vast areas of the physical earth and releasing the energy that mattercontains very inefficiently so that most of the energy is lost in the process ofreleasing it! More than that we turn much of it into pollution and that does yetfurther damage to a planet which has already suffered by the taking of thematter in the first place. State-of-the-art?? As the frequency rises we willunderstand more clearly how to use energy in its non-physical state for all thatwe need for a decent life. We will no longer have to plunder the Earth to‘progress.’ Indeed the knowledge of how to harness non-physical energy for freepower without pollution already exists. But the consequences for the fossilfuel-dependent status quo are so fundamental that the knowledge is suppressed.Not for much longer, however. We are not, as some believe, going back to theStone Age as the old order crumbles. We are going forward to a wonderful newtomorrow. But for now we can only do the best we can with our current knowledgeto reduce the damage we do to the physical planet.The most effective way to be less harmful to the earth is to simplify your life.It is also best for you. If you remove mental and emotional clutter, you havemore space to feel and follow your intuition. And again there is a practicalreason for simplification of our daily lives. Part of the speeding-up ofvibrations is the quickening of what we call time. When people say there is notenough time in the day anymore, they are right. Time is getting faster. We won’tsee the hands of a clock moving quicker, because that is only a humanmeasurement of time. What you might call ‘cosmic time’ is nothing like humantime. It is cosmic time which is moving faster, and it shows itself in more andmore events in a shorter and shorter period, and in the way we are sensing thatthe days, weeks, months and years are passing quicker and quicker. If we don’tremove the irrelevant clutter from our lives, and instead try to continue to doas much as before, we will burn out. It will be like standing on amerry-go-round as it starts to spin. The world that once passed us by quiteslowly will eventually be passing so fast it will be a blur. Simplification ofour lives is vital.I hope you feel you have benefited from my experiences. It makes them so muchmore worthwhile if you have. What I have learned, above all, is to let go offear and guilt and seek to enjoy every moment. There will be times ahead inwhich your emotions will be anything but joyful. This will be only temporary,because we are being offered the opportunity to help to heal this beautiful andbreathtaking planet, and help everyone to lift their understanding beyond theclutches of thought-control, and re-connect with the indescribable light andlove that awaits us all.Don’t worry. Be free from fear. All is well. We are going to do it. This is ourdestiny and we are going to grasp that destiny. We are the generations that havebeen given this gift. We are the generations that will heal the earth and allowher to heal us and the universe.We are all One Consciousness. I am you and you are me. We are all each other.Healing ourselves is healing the world."},{"pageContent":" Useful AddressesFountain International: PO Box 52, Torquay, Devon TQ2 8PECollege of Psychic Studies: 16 Queensberry P1, London SW7 2EBFriends of the Earth: 26–28 Underwood St, London N1 7JQGreenpeace UK: Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PNNational Federation of Spiritual Healers: Old Manor Farm Studios, Church St,Sunbury-on-Thames, MiddlesexPlease send a stamped addressed envelope with all correspondence that requires areply.I have received thousands of letters from all over the World and I read everyone.
