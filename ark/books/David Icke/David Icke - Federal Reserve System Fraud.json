I spent m uch tim e researching the FED and these are the shocking and revealing conclusions. THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IS A PRIVATE COMPANY . Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that Congress shall have the power to coin (create) m oney and regulate the value thereof . Today however, the FED, which is a priva tely owned com pany, controls and prof its by printing m oney through the Treasury, and regulating its value. The FED began with approxim ately 300 people or banks that becam e owners (stockholders purchasing stock at $100 per share - the stock is not publicly traded) in the Federal Reserve Banking System . They m ake up an international banking cartel of wealth beyond com parison (Ref erence 1, 14). The FED banking system collects billions of dollars (Ref erence 8, 17) in interest annually and distributes the prof its to its shareholders. The Congress illegally gave the FED the right to print money (through the Treasury) at no interest to the FED. The FED creates money f rom nothing, and loans it back to us through banks, and charges interest on our currency. The FED also buys Governm ent debt with money printed on a printing press and charges U.S. taxpayers interest. Many Congressm en and Presidents say this is f raud (Ref erence 1,2,3,5,17). Who actually owns the Federal Reserve Central Banks? The ownership of the 12 Central banks, a very well kept secret, has been revealed: Rothschild Bank of London Warburg Bank of Ham burg Rothschild Bank of Berlin Lehm an Brothers of New York Lazard Brothers of Paris Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy Goldm an, Sachs of New York Warburg Bank of Am sterdam Chase Manhattan Bank of New York (Ref erence 14, P. 13, Ref erence 12, P. 152) 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"These bankers are connected to London Banking Houses which ultim ately control the FED. When England lost the Revolutionary War with Am erica (our f oref athers were f ighting their own governm ent), they planned to control us by controlling our banking system , the printing of our m oney, and our debt (Ref erence 4, 22).

Now the banks f inancially back sym pathetic candidates. Not surprisingly, m ost of these candidates are elected (Ref erence 1, P. 208- 210, Ref erence 12, P. 235, Ref erence 14, P. 36).

Presidents Lincoln, Jackson, and Kennedy tried to stop this f amily of bankers by printing U.S. dollars without charging the taxpayers interest (Ref erence 4). Today, if the governm ent runs a def icit, the FED prints dollars through the U.S. Treasury, buys the debt, and the dollars are circulated into the econom y. In 1992, taxpayers paid the FED banking system $286 billion in interest on debt the FED purchased by printing money virtually cost f ree (Ref erence 12, P. 265). Forty percent of our personal f ederal incom e taxes goes to pay this interest. The FED' s books are not open to the public. Congress has yet to audit it. Congressm an Wright Patm an was Chairm an of the House of Representatives Com mittee on Banking and Currency f or 40 years. For 20 of those years, he introduced legislation to repeal the Federal Reserve Banking Act of 1913.

If the m edia is unbiased, independent and com pletely thorough, why haven' t they discussed the FED? Currently, half the states have at least a grass roots m ovem ent in action to abolish the FED, but there' s no press coverage. In July, 1968, the House Banking Subcom mittee reported that Rockef eller, through Chase Manhattan Bank, controlled 5.9% of the stock in CBS. Furtherm ore, the ba nk had gained interlocking directorates with ABC. In 1974, Congress issued a report stating that the Chase Manhattan Bank' s stake in CBS rose to 14.1% and NBC to 4.5% (through RCA, the parent com pany of NBC). The sam e report said that the Chase Manhattan Bank held stock in 28 broadcasting f irm s. Af ter this report, the Chase Manhattan Bank obtained 6.7% of ABC, and today the percentage could be m uch greater. It only requires 5% ownership to signif icantly inf luence the m edia (Ref erence 14, P. 56-57). This is only 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"one of 300 wealthy shareholders of the FED. It is believed other FED owners have sim ilar holdings in the m edia. To control the m edia, FED bankers call in their loans if the m edia disagrees with them (Ref erence 25, P. 134-137). Rockef eller also controls the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the sole purpose of which is to aid in stim ulating greater interest in f oreign affairs and in a one world governm ent. Nearly every m ajor newscaster belongs to the Council on Foreign Relations. The Council on Foreign Relations controls m any m ajor newspapers and m agazines. Additionally, major corporations owned by FED shareholders are the source of huge advertising revenues which surely would inf luence the m edia (Ref erence 14, P. 56-59). It can be no wonder why groups such as FED-UP(tm ) receive m inim al, if any, press attention. How do taxpayers stop f inancing those whose purpose it is to destroy us? First, expose their activity, then dem and change. THE SOLUTION: Currently all we do is exchange FED m oney (interest attached) f or real U.S. m oney (interest-f ree) dollar f or dollar as Kennedy tried to do. We should not be required to pay interest on our own currency. According to Benjam in Franklin, this was one of the prim ary reasons we f ought the Revolutionary War. Today we are still f ighting the sam e family of bankers (Ref erence 4, Ref erence 1, P. 211, 212). The U.S. Governm ent can buy back the FED at any tim e f or $450 million (per Congressional record). The U.S. Treasury could then collect all the prof it on our m oney instead of the 300 original shareholders of the FED. The $4 trillion of U.S. debt could be exchanged dollar f or dollar with U.S. non- interest bearing currency when the debt becom es due. There would be no inf lation because there would be no additional currency in circulation. Personal incom e tax could be cut if we bought back the FED and theref ore, the econom y would expand. According to the Constitution, Congress is to control the creation of m oney, keeping the am ount of inf lation or def lation in check. If Congress isn' t doing their job, they should be voted out of of fice. Unf ortunately, voters can' t vote the FED or its Chairm an out of of fice. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" If the governm ent has a def icit, we could handle it as Lincoln and Kennedy did. Print m oney and circulate it into the econom y, but this tim e interest-f ree. Today the FED, through f oreign banks, owns m uch of our debt and theref ore controls us. The FED will cease to exist as taxpayers becom e inf orm ed and tell other taxpayers. The news m edia and Congress will have no choice but to m eet the dem ands of grass roots Am erica. (Reference 1, P. 17, 22) AMERICA DECEIVED By law (check the Congressional record), we can buy back the FED f or the original investm ent of the FED' s 300 shareholders, which is $450 million (Ref erence 1, P. 227, Ref erence 17, P. 36). If each taxpayer paid $25, we could buy back the FED and all the prof it would f low into the U.S. Treasury. In other words, by Congress allowing the constitutionally illegal FED to continue, m uch of your taxes go to the shareholders of the FED and their bankers. Note: The people who enacted the FED started the IRS, within m onths of the FED' s inception. The FED buys U.S. debt with m oney they printed f rom nothing, then charges the U.S. taxpayers interest. The governm ent had to create incom e tax to pay the interest expense to the FED' s shareholders, but the incom e tax was never legally passed (Ref erence 20 shows details, state-by-state why it was not legally passed). The FED is illegal, per Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. Not one state legally ratif ied the 16th Am endm ent m aking incom e tax legal. Currently, f ewer and f ewer Am ericans are being convicted f or ref usal to pay incom e taxes. In IRS jury trials, the jury, by law, m ust decide if the law is just. If taxpayers do not believe the law is just, the jury m ay declare the accused innocent. Judges are legally bound to inf orm juries of their right to determ ine the f airness of a law. Judges of ten do not disclose this inf orm ation so they can control the court outcom e. Luckily, more and m ore citizens are becom ing inf orm ed. If one juror f eels the law is unf air, they can f ind the def endant innocent (Ref erence 19). In Utah, the IRS quit prosecuting taxpayers because jurors verdict is not guilty. Please tell your f riends and sit in the next jury. If we elim inate the FED and uphold the Constitution, we could balance the budget and cut personal incom e tax to alm ost nothing.

Tell your f riends the truth and win Am erica back. We don' t even need to buy back the FED. We only need to print m oney the way the Constitution requires, not the new proposed international m oney. We want to keep our sovereignty and print real U.S. m oney. Why has Congress allowed the FED to continue? If a Congressperson tries to abolish the FED, the banks f und the Congressperson' s opponent in the next election (Ref erence 17, P. 35). The new Congressperson will obviously support the FED. When Congresspeople retire, political cam paign f unds are not taxed. Get elected and be a m illionaire if you vote right. By the way, the prof it of the FED is not taxed either (Ref erence 1, 9). Once Am erica understands, and takes action, Congresspeople will then gladly a bolish the FED. In 1992, Illinois Congressm an Crane introduced a bill, co-sponsored by 40 other Congressm an, to audit the FED. This is a step in the right direction. Am erica is a great nation. As \"We the People\" becom e inf orm ed, the media and Congress will be f orced to buy back the FED, balance the budget, signif icantly cut taxes, a nd stop allowing bribes to determ ine voting strategies. I have already heard f rom politicians who claim they will change their platf orm to include abolishing the FED if enough people becom e inf orm ed. IT IS UP TO YOU TO INFORM THE PEOPLE.

Many publications show that these bankers f inanced World War I, World War II, and the Russian Revolutionary War, which helped Napoleon, Lenin, and Hitler com e to power. They f inanced both sides from m oney created f rom nothing and prof ited greatly. These sam e bankers created a num ber of Am erican depressions to change the U.S. legislation and seize our wealth.

More wars create m ore debt which m eans m ore prof it to the bankers (Ref erence 1, 21). These bankers planned three world wars so people would welcom e United Nations intervention to govern the world in peace, not war.

History shows that bef ore any governm ent took over, they disarm ed the citizens. Hitler did it, and bef ore our Revolutionary War, King George told us to disarm - good thing we didn' t! Under the Federal Reserve Bank Act, the bankers control our econom y. The FED controls interest rates and the am ount of m oney in the econom y. These f actors determ ine either econom ic prosperity or the lack thereof . Bankers are now pushing f or a one world governm ent and a cashless society. Why cashless? No cash m eans no m oney f or drugs, no thef t, and the ability to collect taxes on the underground econom y. Anyone who wouldn' t support a cashless society m ust be a drug dealer, thief , or tax evader, right? What a cashless society really m eans is the banks can now control you. Today you f ear the IRS. In a cashless society, if you disagree with the bankers' political goals, you' ll f ind your money gone via com puter error. (For additional inf orm ation on a cashless society, read Ref erence 13, P. 174; Ref erence 3; Ref erence 14, P. 9-12; Ref erence 15, P. 136; Ref erence 25, P. 216). If you could accurately predict f uture interest rates, inf lation and def lation, you would know when to buy or sell stocks and m ake a bundle of m oney. The FED has secret m eetings (per Congressional Record) to determ ine f uture interest rates and the am ount of m oney to be printed. The Securities Exchange Com mission (SEC) by law, stops insiders f rom prof iting by privileged inf orm ation. Congressional records prove that FED bankers routinely hold secret meetings to prof it by m anipulating the stock m arket via interest rates and the am ount of m oney they create. FED bankers also prof it greatly f rom econom ic disasters like the Depression (Ref erence 22, P. 56). The bankers create inf lation, sell their stocks bef ore the m arket crashes, then buy up stocks at cheaper prices. Bankers adm itted this to Congress. This violates the law, yet Congress does not act because these bankers are large political contributors (Ref erence 17, P. 96-98; Ref erence 1, P. 162-163; Ref erence 22, P. 114- 170 & P. 136). Thom as Jef ferson predicted this scenario if we ever allowed a private bank, like the FED, to create our currency (Ref erence 1, P. 247). FED Chairm an Burns states \"Killing can be m ade sim ply by knowing the next f ew m onths newspapers ahead of tim e.\" Congressm an Patm an said \"The FED of ficials own m ore than 100 m illion dollars (of stocks) 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"while m aking decisions influencing these stock prices...\" (Reference 24, P. 123). History proves that banks prof it f rom bankrupting a nation (Reference 22, P. 56). Congress consistently def eats balanced budget am endm ents. In the past 30 years, Congress has raised our ta xes 56 tim es and balanced the budget only once. We need the sound banking system our f oref athers wanted us to have. History proves that banking system s like the FED don' t work. Major world powers have been destroyed over sim ilar banking system s (Ref erence 1). If we don' t change this system NOW, in f ive years the only thing our taxes will pay is the interest on the national debt. Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act, passed Decem ber 23, 1913, states that m uch of the prof it of the FED should f low into the U.S. Treasury. In 1959, new legislation allowed the FED to transf er bonds to com mercial banks at no cost to the bank. Now the FED receives less interest incom e and less prof it f or the U.S. Treasury because the m oney is diverted to other banks through an accounting entry (Ref erence 17, P. 115-130). Congress and the IRS do not have access to the f inancial records of the FED. Every year Congress introduces legislation to audit the FED, and every year it is def eated. The FED banking system could easily be netting 100s of billions in prof it each year. Through \"creative accounting\" prof it can easily be reclassif ied as expense (Ref erence 14, P. 20, Ref erence 17, P. 239). Within the f irst f ew years, the shareholders of the FED received their initial investm ent back with no risk. All the incom e is tax-f ree, except f or property tax, according to the Federal Reserve Act. When are the prof its of the FED going to start f lowing into the Treasury so that average Am ericans are no longer burdened with excessive, unnecessary taxes? Clearly, Congress cannot or will not control the FED.

The Constitution gives only Congress the right to print m oney. * From the beginning of the United States to present there have been two ways to issue new currency: The first way is to have the governm ent print the m oney, debt and interest- free, and circulate it through the econom y for use as a m edium of exchange. There is no tax levied to pay interest on the currency in circulation because it is debt and interest-free. This is the system Lincoln used with his \"greenbacks\", a system Kennedy desired, and Jefferson dem anded. The second m ethod is: The Citizens allow the bank to print $500 billion in currency (cash). The bank pays for printing costs, ink, and paper. The Citizens do not charge the bank any interest for use of the $500 billion in printed currency. The bank uses the $500 billion cash to buy a $500 billion governm ent bond which pays the bankers interest. The bank keeps som e of the bonds and sells, for a fee (10%), som e of the bonds to the public. The bank can buy back the bonds from the public sim ply by printing m ore m oney. The bankers can create inflation and depressions by m anipulating the am ount of currency in circulation. The FED operates exactly like this today. It also prints money (through the U.S. Treasury) and uses this printed m oney to buy loans from other banks. This m oney has created our inflation. W e give the bank cash interest-free, then they charge us interest on our own currency. Take a look at our history in view of the two banking system s: BEN FRANKLIN - THE TW O BANKING SYSTEMS From the autobiography of Ben Franklin as reported by Gertrude Coogan in Money Creators: 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"...the inability of the colonists to get the power to issue their own m oney perm anently out of the hands of George III and the international bankers was the PRIME reason for the Revolutionary W ar. (Reference 4). Ben Franklin answering a question about the boom ing econom y of the young colonies: \"That is sim ple. In the colonies we issue our own m oney. It is called Colonial Scrip. W e issue it in proper proportions to the dem ands of trade and industry.\" (Colonial Scrip had no debt or interest attached.) (Reference 4) BANK OF AMERICA International bankers saw that interest-free scrip would keep Am erica free of their influence, so by 1781 banker-backed Alexander Ham ilton succeeded in starting the Bank of Am erica. After a few years of \"bank m oney\", the prosperity of \"Colonial Scrip\" was gone . Benjam in Franklin said, \"Conditions were so reversed that the era of prospe rity had ended and a depression set in to such an extent that the streets of the Colonies were f illed with the unem ployed!\" Bank m oney was like our FED m oney. It had debt and interest attached. By 1790 Ham ilton and his bankers had created a privately owned central bank and converted the public debt (interest-free) into interest bearing bonds, payable to the bankers. W hen Ham ilton' s bank charter expired in 1811, the international bankers started the war of 1812. By 1816, another privately- owned U.S. bank was started with $35 m illion in assets - only $7 m illion of that was owned by the governm ent. This bank lasted for 20 years. U.S. history shows that currency with debt and interest attached created a depression. (Reference 4) ANDREW JACKSON - A GREAT PRESIDENT! When the 1816 charter expired in 1836, Andrew Jackson vetoed its renewal. It was then that he m ade two f amous statem ents: \"The Bank is trying to kill m e - but I will kill it!\" Later he said \"If the Am erican people only understood the rank injustice of our m oney and banking system - there would be a revolution before m orning...\" (Reference 4) ABRAHAM LINCOLN - ANOTHER GREAT PRESIDENT! President Lincoln needed m oney to finance the Civil W ar, and the international bankers offered him loans at 24-36% interest. Lincoln balked at their dem ands because he didn' t want to plunge the nation into such a huge debt. Lincoln approached Congress about passing a law to authorize the printing of U.S. Treasury Notes. Lincoln said \"W e gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever had - their own paper m oney to pay 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"their debts...\" Lincoln printed over 400 m illion \"Greenbacks\" (debt and interest-free) and paid the soldiers, U.S. governm ent em ployees, and bought war supplies. The international bankers didn' t like it and wanted Lincoln to borrow the m oney from them so that the Am erican people would owe trem endous interest on the loan. Lincoln' s solution m ade this seem ridiculous. (Reference 1, P. 46, 47; Reference 4) Shortly after Lincoln' s death, the governm ent revoked the Greenback law which ended Lincoln' s debt-free, inte rest-free m oney. A new national banking act was enacted and all m oney becam e interest bearing again. (Reference 4) The late Thom as A Edison explained the m atter of issuing currency this way: \"If our nation can issue a dollar bond (inter est bearing) it can issue a dollar bill (interest-free). The elem ent that m akes the bond good m akes a bill good also. The difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets m oney brokers collect twice the am ount of the bond and an additional 20 percent, whereas the currency pays nobody but those who contribute directly in som e useful way. It is absurd to say that our country can issue $30 m illion in bonds and not $30 m illion in currency. Both are prom ises to pay: But one prom ise fattens the usurers (interest collectors) and the other helps the people.\" (Reference 1, P. 46) The FED is owned largely by foreign banks that control our econom y and Congress through the power of m oney and the m edia which they bought with profits generated with profits generated by artificial debt. If we can convert U.S. dollars that are debt and interest-free to interest bearing currency, we can change it back just as easily. Both the m edia and the banking system will probably claim that such a change will cause hyper- inflation. The answer however, can be found in history. Lincoln printed debt and interest- free Greenbacks (cash) to finance an entire war. W ith added production you can add currency without having hyper-inflation. Lincoln proved it. John F. Kennedy - a President with vision! On June 4, 1964, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110. This Executive Order called for the issuance of new currency - the United States Note. At the tim e, $4,292,893 of this currency was put into circulation. This new currency was to be distributed through the U.S. Treasury and not the Federal Reserve System . Furtherm ore, it was to be issued debt and interest-free. Upon Kennedy' s assassination, this currency was withdrawn from circulation, never to be issued again. The m edia rem ained silent on how Kennedy would have elim inated the debt and interest paym ents, and therefore elim inated the FED. Interest-free United States Notes do not result in hyper-inflation. By issuing United States Notes, interest-free, we have less interest expense, and less taxes. W ith less taxes people spend more and buy m ore. This result is added production, and therefore, you can add dollars without inflation. Either Rockefeller and his people will spend your tax m oney into the econom y or you get to spend your own m oney by 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"paying less taxes. The bankers want you to think you' ll have m ass inflation by changing the system . This is only true if you add dollars to the econom y without added production. For exam ple, look what happened in post W orld War I Germ any. They m erely printed m oney without increasing production. The result was hyper-inflation. Another exam ple: In the entire econom y, if you have only 10 loaves of bread and only $10, each loaf would sell for $1. If you print an extra $10, now you have $20 and the 10 loaves which would sell for $2 each. This is only true if we don' t have added production. By cutting taxes, people will spend m ore and buy m ore bread. If we print m ore m oney and bake m ore bread, we have $50 and 50 loaves, so each loaf still sells for $1. As long as you m onitor production with increased cash, inflation will not occur. Under the FED system , the price of bread has dram atically increased since 1913. If we cut taxes and YOU spend your m oney instead of the BANKERS spending it, you will have m ore bread, cars, and wealth than the bankers. SOMEONE will spend your m oney - it m ight as well be YOU! A FED-like banking system has destroyed other governm ents. In five years the only thing taxes will pay is the interest on the debt. Clearly, the FED m ust be abolished before we' re dem olished! Already laws are set up to have a dictatorship when we have the econom ic crisis (Federal Em ergency Managem ent Act, or FEMA). Under the FED system , when a new dollar is issued, we pay taxes to pay for the dollar as the principal (debt) plus interest on the dollar. W e pay for each new dollar twice, and who gets m ost of the m oney? The bankers, who control this m oney. Taxpayers should only pay taxes for the paper, ink, and printing costs of new m oney. W hy should we give bankers the right to print m oney on a printing press, charge them no interest on this m oney, and then let them exchange their \"free\" m oney for a governm ent bond that pays them interest? ? England never gave up on owning the United States. They are still silently fighting the sam e Revolutionary W ar. The Bank of England, through the Rothschilds, owns and controls the FED (Reference 22). W e have been robbed of our wealth, and in five years we will be bankrupt if there is no change. • The FED bankers will LEGALLY OW N OUR NATION; OUR HOUSES, OUR CARS, OUR BUSINESSES, just as Thom as Jefferson predicted. SPECIFIC PLAN: HOW TO GET OUT OF DEBT U.S. history proves that issuing debt and interest-free currency allows our econom y to prosper, as long as Congress controls the am ount of m oney created. You can add printed dollars into the econom y as you add production, and there will be no inflation. W ith today' s sophisticated com puters, we can easily m onitor the printing of m oney and inflation. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Congress needs to buy back the FED and/or abolish it. Any governm ent debt they own would be autom atically elim inat ed. All rem aining debt could be paid as needed with the sam e type of currency Kennedy issued (debt and interest- free United States Notes). United States Notes are backed by the full faith of the best governm ent in the world - The United States of Am erica. This is no different than the backing of today' s Federal Reserve Notes. U.S. citizens collect only a sm all fraction of the inte rest incom e on Federal Bonds and Bills. Foreigners benefit from this interest, but we pay the tax so that they collect interest on our currency. This m akes sense to bankers and Congresspeople who receive m oney from bankers and foreign lobbyists. As we pay less interest, governm ent spending will decrease and so will taxes. Less taxes m ean that people buy m ore goods and services and our econom y expands. An expanded econom y m eans m ore jobs and higher profits for businesses. More profit m eans increased state/federal business taxes. Businesses continue to pay taxes while personal taxes decrease. People will have m ore m oney to spend, will buy m ore, and therefore pay increased state sales tax. This allows the states to balance their budgets without raising real estate taxes. As history proves, we will prosper. For 80 years the FED has destroyed our econom y. It will take years to undo this dam age. Just as Congress appoints a Postal Service, we will have Congress appoint an agency to m onitor inflation as we exchange our retiring governm ent debt for debt and interest-free United States Notes (cash).

W hen a state considers a Constitutional Convention, concerned Am ericans call the Hotline and it gives us the nam es and telephone num bers of the legislators involved. It tells us exactly what to say, and to whom . The Hotline helps us to f ight and win! Secondly, we m ust change the opinions of the m asses with inform ation. The brochure has been a big help, and once 10% of the population agrees to abolish the FED, the rest will f ollow. It is obvious the m edia (radio and newspapers) have lied about the FED and the efforts of FED-UP(tm ) to educate people with the truth. This will not stop us - we will persist! Decide for yourself if you want to win Am erica back. If 10,000 patriotic Am ericans each distribute 1,000 brochures, 10 m illion Am ericans will becom e inform ed. It would be alm ost im possible to stop people from talking about abolishing the FED if that m any Am ericans were inform ed. Another way you can participate is to put a bum per sticker on your car. Over 1,000 people every m onth will see that bum per sticker about abolishing the FED. If you think our goal is im possible, rem ember this; only 3% of Am ericans supported the Revolutionary W ar, and we won that war. W e can win this war too, but only with your help. IN CLOSING For the secret owners of the FED to control the volum e of m oney and becom e our absolute m asters, they had to get the Gold away from our grandparents. This was accom plished in 1933 with the threats of fines and im prisonm ents by their President Franklin D. Roosevelt with aide Harry Hopkins, who said... \"Elect, elect, elect, tax, tax, tax, spend, spend, spend, for the people are too dam ned stupid to understand\". By the way, Roosevelt was an international Banker. See Fool' s Gold is Green by W inston Sm ith.

The Revolutionary W ar was fought and the Constitution was written to prevent other nations and private banks from issu ing (printing) m oney and controlling our currency. In 1913, m embers of Congress com mitted treason and violated their oath of office to def end the Constitution against all enem ies f oreign and dom estic by voting in the Federal Reserve Bank. For the New W orld Order to create a one world governm ent, they m ust control a central bank, elim inate the Constitution, end Christian values, disarm Am erica, and control the m edia. The Council on Fore ign Relations has openly said they will take us over in favor of a one world governm ent. The Am erican people m ust be warned or we m ay lose our freedom forever. If we do not dem and our rights and uphold the Constitution, the CFR and bankers will continue their m arch toward socialism . If we allow them to continue, they will abolish our rights and put an end to our present governm ent.
