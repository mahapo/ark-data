Longwalker S ince 19911 have been uncovering the network that really controls this \"world\" behind the facades of \"freedom\", \"democracy\", \"liberty\" and \"justice\". In truth these exist only as illusions and delusions in the manufactured movie we are told is \"life\". They are figments of our perception, that's all. Through these years there has rarely been a day in which I have not worked in some way to uncover or communicate the astonishing story of how a network of interbreeding bloodlines going back to the ancient world has expanded its control over the human population until, today, a full-blown global dictatorship is within its sight and within its grasp. To understand the true background to the horrors of September 11th 2001, you have to research and understand so many subjects, many of them considered bizarre or crazy to our conditioned reality. Once the pieces are understood then the puzzle has to be put together to allow the extraordinary picture of human existence to be revealed. So when people ask me why this information has never been made public before there are three main answers: (a) many researchers have uncovered aspects of it, even large swathes of it, but communicating what they know through the mainstream media has been i mpossible; (b) the compartmentalised secrecy behind which the truth is hidden has been extremely effective; and (c) because of the staggering amount of research over so many years that is necessary to understand the pieces even before the puzzle itself can be addressed. Without this background knowledge the manipulators can hoodwink the global population by explaining away grotesque atrocities like September llth with a ridiculous cover story that protects the real perpetrators and justifies the responses, like the \"war\" with Afghanistan, that further their goal of global dictatorship. In my last three books on these subjects, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret, and Children Of The Matrix, I have presented a total of 1,500 pages detailing the story of human control and how the same interbreeding bloodlines that produced the kings and queens of the ancient world now produce the presidents, prime ministers, banking and business leaders, media owners and military chiefs of the I"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Clearly, I can't detail it all again in this book because its focus is the staggering events of September 11th 2001 and their aftermath, but the information is already in print for anyone who wants more supporting evidence. Here, for those new to these subjects, I will set out a brief summary of the essential background necessary to understand what really happened on 9/11. Readers of my other books will already be well versed in this information. Bloodlines and the \"divine\" right to rule The families that covertly control the system that controls the people are spawned from ancient bloodlines that have a different DNA to the rest of the population. It has been described to me by insiders as a DNA \"corruption\". The differences in the DNA are tiny, but highly significant. In fact in DNA terms there is not that much difference between humans and mice, but look at the fantastic difference in how they manifest and what they can do. When you look back through history you find the theme of the \"divine right\" of kings and queens. What is that? It is the right to rule ... because of your bloodline, your DNA. I will go into the origins of these ruling families and what is really meant by \"divine\" at the end of the book. It is so challenging and mind-blowing to most people it is best left until much more has been said. Suffice to say that these bloodlines are not \"human\" in the sense that we perceive the term \"human\". This rule-by-bloodline still openly exists today, of course, with Queen Elizabeth II, an obvious example. She only lives in Buckingham Palace and enjoys all the power and privilege of a head of state because of her DNA. If she had a different DNA she might be cleaning the throne rather than sitting on it. The same applies to the rest of her family, which is strictly structured according to its DNA relationship to the reigning \"monarch\". As the ancient records confirm, it was the \"royal\" bloodlines (the \"demi-gods\") that were placed in positions of ruling royal power thousands of years ago. They were the kings and queens in Egypt, Sumer, the Indus Valley and around the world who claimed the divine right to rule because of their bloodline. What people don't realise is that the political, business, banking and media leaders are also overwhelmingly operating within a similar DNA hierarchy that decides who does what. This is because they are of the same bloodlines as the ancient royal and aristocratic families who ruled thousands of years ago. The same interbreeding \"royal and aristocratic\" tribe has controlled the world for all this time. Only the positions from which they operate have changed. Fantastic cataclysms struck the earth around perhaps 11,500 to 12,000 years ago. These destroyed, in stages, vast continents in the Atlantic and Pacific that have become known as Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria. The universal stories of the Great Flood are related to this. After these literally world-shattering events, and others that followed, the \"divine\" bloodline installed itself again in various locations. This happened most significantly in the Near and Middle East, especially from about"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 3 Figure 1: The highly advanced cultures in the Middle-Near East with Sumer the most powerful and significant. From this region have come many of the bloodlines that thousands of years later continue to control the world 4,000BC with an empire based on Sumer in what is now called Iraq, and it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sumer, according to official history, was the start of human \"civilisation\" as we know it, but in fact it was merely the re- start after the Atlantis/Mu upheavals (Figure 1). The bloodline was placed in the positions of royal and administrative power over the people in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, the Indus Valley and much further afield, including the Americas and China. Over thousands of years, these bloodlines expanded out of the Middle and Near East into Europe, and the royal bloodlines of Sumer, Egypt, etc., became the royal and aristocratic families of Britain, Ireland and the countries of mainland Europe, especially France, Germany and what is now called Belgium (Figure 2 overleaf). Wherever they went these royal and aristocratic lines interbred obsessively with each other through arranged marriages and secret breeding programmes. You can see the same with the ruling families of today because they are seeking to perpetuate a particular genetic code, the DNA \"corruption\" that can be quickly diluted by breeding outside of their bloodline circle.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Figure 2: From at least 3000bc, peoples of the Sumer Empire, like the Phoenicians and Egyptians, sailed to Britain and took their knowledge and symbols to those islands. Others began to move across land to settle in what we now call France, Germany, and the rest of northern Europe. Wherever they went, the Illuminati bloodlines invariably ruled as kings, queens, and nobility headquarters to Rome and it was during this time that we had the Roman Empire and the creation of the Roman Church or institutionalised Christianity. The headquarters eventually moved on again into northern Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This was when the Dutch began to build their empire through the Dutch East India Company and they settled South Africa. In 1688, William of Orange, one of the bloodlines, invaded England from The Netherlands and took the throne as William III in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after her death in 1694. In that year William signed the charter that created the Bank of England, and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking and manufactured debt has always been one of the key vehicles used by the bloodlines to control humanity. From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret society network moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course, was the \"great\" and enormous British Empire. This was not the Empire of the \"British\" in truth, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain.

When the European empires began to recede and collapse, especially in the 20th century, it appeared that these colony continents, like the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia, had won their \"independence\". Instead the Illuminati bloodlines were merely exchanging open. control for the far more effective covert control - manipulation of events by the Hidden Hand that the public has no idea even exists. While these empires were apparently being dismantled, the Illuminati left in their \"former\" colonies, including the United States, the bloodline and the secret society network through which they manipulate. Ever since that time they have continued to control events in these \"former\" colonies as part of a long-planned agenda to impose centralised control of the planet and its people. This is designed to be structured as a world government, army, central bank and currency; a micro-chipped population connected to a global computer; and a society based on constant and total surveillance of every man, woman and child. A ridiculous conspiracy `theory'? Well have another look around and you'll see that this is happening today, now, and never more blatantly than since September 11th. We are seeing unfold by the day the very Big Brother society described by George Orwell (real name Eric Blair) in his famous book, 1984. 1 1 believe that Orwell was not writing from his imagination so much as from insider knowledge of the agenda and this is the very governmental structure that is now staring us in the face - especially since September 11th. The need for centralisation is obvious. The greater the diversity of decision-making the less control you are going to have over those decisions. Diversity is the controllers' nightmare and they have worked constantly to centralise decision-making and increase their power. The reason that the centralisation in all areas of our lives, political, economic, business, military and media has progressed with a faster and faster pace is a simple equation. The more you centralise power the more power you have to centralise even quicker. The bloodline presidents The bloodlines that seek to control the world and our lives today are the same bloodlines that ruled the ancient societies. They are the presidents of the United States, the prime ministers, the leading banking and business families, the media owners and those who control the military. The US presidents are a wonderful example of this. There are some 280 million people in the United States today and many hundreds of millions more have lived in that country since the major Freemason George Washington was inaugurated more than 200 years ago. Not only that, the genetic diversity of the American people has been enormous because of the many locations from which they have come. So you would expect that the 43 presidents from Washington to George W. Bush would express some of that diversity, surely? After all, one of the mantras supporting the myth of American \"freedom\" is that anyone can become President of the United States. Er, sorry. The genetic diversity of the US presidents is incredibly limited and fundamentally connected to European royal and aristocratic bloodlines (see The Biggest Secret and Children Of The Matrix). Of the 43 presidents, 34 go back genetically to Charlemagne"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. ft's just a choice right now between fear and love. (742-814), the most famous monarch of what we now call France and a major figure i n the Illuminati story and the bloodline. He was leader of the Franks, after whom we get the name France, and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. From the Illuminati point of view, he was serious bloodline. In the last weeks of the farcical 2000 US presidential election campaign, Burke's Peerage, the blue-blood \"bible\" of royal and aristocratic genealogy, confirmed the theme I am highlighting here. Four years earlier, when Bill Clinton faced Bob Dole, Burke's Peerage said that the candidate with the most royal genes had won every single presidential election in US history. Clinton and George W. Bush have since continued that unbroken sequence. In a Reuters report of October 17th 2000, Burkes Peerage confirmed that both George W. Bush and \"opponent\" Al Gore were of royal descent with Bush the \"bluer\" of the two. Purely by knowing his bloodline and watching the behind-the-scenes developments, I was able to predict three years before the 2000 election that George W. Bush would be the next President of the United States. Bush is related to every European monarch on and off the throne, i ncluding the king of Albania, and has \"kinship\" with every member of Britain's royal family, the report said. He is a 13th cousin of Britain's Queen Mother, who died in 2002 at the age of 101, and her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, once removed, of the heir to the throne Prince Charles, and has a direct descent from Henry III and from Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudor, who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. Bush is further descended from Charles IT of England. Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said in the Reuters report: \"It is now clear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush have an unusually large number of royal and noble descents.\" But only unusual if you don't know the story. He added: \"In point of fact, never in the history of the United States have two presidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances.\" Brooks-Baker said there had always been a significant \"royal factor\" in those who aspire to the White House with presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue-blood links. He said that Al Gore, a cousin of former President Richard Nixon, was a descendant of England's Edward I and has direct links to the Holy Roman Empire through Emperors Louis 11, Charles II, and Louis I. This, therefore, makes him a descendant of Charlemagne, the 8th century Emperor. These Charlemagne links make Al Gore a cousin of George W. Bush. The secret language - symbolism The bloodlines and their Illuminati network are obsessed with symbolism and their symbols and codes going back thousands of years can clearly be found throughout American society and the rest of the world. The ancient Illuminati symbol of the pyramid with the capstone missing or the pyramid and all-seeing eye was placed on the dollar bill (Figure 3) in 1933/34 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the most significant front men for the Illuminati in the United States during the 20th century.

The Illuminati lighted torch is held by the Statue of Liberty. This was given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew what she and the torch really symbolised. There is a virtual mirror i mage of the Statue of Liberty on an island in the River Seine in Paris. The Statue of Liberty is, in fact, the symbolic i mage of Queen Semiramis, the goddess worshipped by the Illuminati bloodlines when they were based in Babylon. If you look at Figures 4 and 5 (overleaf) you can see the image of Queen Semiramis on an ancient coin and her representation as the Statue of Liberty. The Babylonian trinity was: Nimrod, who was symbolised as a fish; Tammuz or Ninus, the son who died to save humanity; and Queen Semiramis, the mother goddess who was symbolised as a dove. The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They place their symbols all around us but present them with the reverse of their true meaning. For example, the dove symbolises peace to most people, but to the Illuminati bloodlines it represents their goddess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch means freedom and liberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the very symbol of their agenda and control. The Nazis reversed. the ancient symbol of the swastika to symbolise the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram to point downwards for the same reason. Everything is symbolism and ritual to the Illuminati, and always has been. After they killed President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry placed an obelisk in Dealey Plaza with a lighted torch at the top. When they buried Kennedy at Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC they placed a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternal flame, on his grave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murdered Princess Diana in Paris is a massive representation of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty. It is located on top of the Pont de L'Alma Tunnel where the Illuminati arranged for her to die in 1997 (see The Biggest Secret). Queen Semiramis, which translates as \"branch bearer\", was symbolised in Babylon as a dove and when the Illuminati bloodlines moved their headquarters to Rome this goddess was worshipped as Venus Columba or Venus the Dove. The French word for dove is still colombe. This is why a man who signed his name \"Colon\" is known to official history as \"Columbus\". He was bearing the branch of the dove into the Americas in 1492 and was given this symbolic name relating to the Figure 3: The ancient Illuminati symbol of the pyramid and all -seeing eye on the dollar bill"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 This \"world\" i s only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Figure 4: This is how the Illuminati goddess, Queen Semiramis, the \"branch-bearer\", was portrayed by the ancients Figure 5: Semiramis again, this time under the guise of the Statue of \"Liberty\" Illuminati \"Goddess\". So we have the centre of US government located in Washington \"DC\" - the District of Columbia, or the dove, Semiramis. We have British Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS), Columbia University, and Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and the lighted torch. The symbols abound in relation to September 11th, also. The twin towers, or twin pillars, are ancient Illuminati symbols that go back at least to Atlantis. One of the foundation legends in the Mythology of the Freemasons and the Knights Templar secret societies is that of Jachin and Boaz ... the \"Twin Pillars\" of Atlantis, which are said to have been erected at the entrance to King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. In the Old Testament you will find references to this: And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. ( 1 Kings 7:21) And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. ( 2 Chronicles 3:17) You will find the symbol of the twin pillars in Freemasonic architecture and the original ones are said to have been built, according to Freemasonic legend, by i nhabitants of Atlantis called \"the children of Lamech\". The United States is the \"New Atlantis\" to the Illuminati. There is a legend of the twin pillars, or twin towers, in which one represented Upper Egypt (the \"north tower\") and the other symbolised Lower Egypt (the south tower). There is also the mythology of the twin pillars of Hercules that he is said to have placed at the entrance to the Mediterranean.

The recurrence of 11 in the events of that day are remarkable -but highly predictable for those who study Illuminati ritual.' It was 11 years to the day before 9/11 - September 11th 1990 - that Father George Bush made a speech to Congress calling for a New World Order. This is the ancient code name for the Illuminati agenda for global control that the terrorist attacks were designed to advance. The Pentagon was also targetted on September 11th. The symbol of the pentagon is the centre of the pentagram, the most obvious symbol of Satanic and Illuminati ritual and 911 is the phone number that Americans call to report emergencies. This is not a coincidence, as anyone who has studied the Illuminati's astonishing obsession with symbolism will know. In the final chapter I'll explain where this obsession comes from. The name Capitol Hill is also Illuminati symbolism and named after Capitoline Hill, a sacred place for the Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. (See The Biggest Secret and the symbolism archives on my website for extensive information about the Illuminati secret language that can be seen all around us.) The symbolism can. also be found in their language and statements. To crack their code, you have to reverse what they appear to say. When they announce that they believe something, it means they don't. When they say they will do something, it means they won't. When they say they won't, it means they will and so on. It is a real life Alice in Wonderland.. They operate with this coded symbolism in which everything is reversed. Thus killing thousands of Afghan civilians becomes \"fighting for freedom, peace and justice\". Reverse \"theirs\" to \"ours\" in this statement by George W. Bush after September 11th, for example, and he is actually talking about himself and those who control him: \"Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice while daring to claim the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil, it is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in the terrorists evil has found a willing servant.\" The Illuminati The world's \"elite\" families, no more than 13 at the peak of the pyramid, manipulate their control of humanity through a network of secret societies. This network and the interbreeding bloodlines it serves have become known as the Illuminati, the 'Illuminated Ones'. The Illuminati is an organisation within all significant organisations. It's like a cancer. All the major secret societies feed carefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and these are the ones you find in positions of power throughout the world. They infest all colours, races, creeds and countries, and yet, so effective is the compartmentalised secrecy that even the vast majority of people within these secret societies have no idea what they are really part of. Most Freemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levels of degree, the so-called Blue Degrees. They have no idea what their organisation is being used for. Even most of those who make it to the apparently highest level, like"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any ti me we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and l ove, the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite, can know relatively little unless they are \"chosen\". Only the tiny few, all from particular bloodlines and their offshoots, progress through the official peak of their 'individual' secret society into the Illuminati degrees above that. These are the levels into which the secret societies feed the chosen ones, but at least 95% of their members have no idea that these levels exist, never mind who is in them and what happens there. Among the key secret societies within the Illuminati web are the upper levels of the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, Knights of St John of Jerusalem, and the Jesuits, the network that controls the Roman Catholic Church and uses it to serve the Illuminati. The Jesuit hierarchy is extremely powerful within the Illuminati all over the world and highly significant in the manipulation of global society. Some of the family lines involved are the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, House of Lorraine, Habsburgs, and the Thurn and Taxis dynasty from Bergamo, Italy, which expanded into Belgium, Bavaria, and wider afield. The Thurn and Taxis bloodline is also highly significant to the Illuminati although not mentioned by researchers as often as some of the others. The freemasons Jim Shaw, a former 33rd-degree Freemason, exposes the Craft in his book, The Deadly Deception' and confirms what I have just described. He explains how Freemasonry is based on a structure of compartmentalised pyramids (Figure 6). Only a few make it to the top of the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite or the 10 degrees of the York Rite and even then they still don't know the real secrets. Shaw says he was surprised when a fellow 33rd-degree Mason said that \"they\" had told him he was \"going higher\" and the guy left the temple by a different door! , A bigger pyramid encompasses all the major secret societies and at that point they are one secret society. So you have this vast web of secret societies with millions of members worldwide who think they know what they are involved in, but, in truth, only a few have any idea of what is going on and who, ultimately, is calling the shots. Albert Pike, who died in 1891, was one of the most pre-eminent figures in world Freemasonry Among his titles were Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry. In his book, Morals and Dogma, written for higher-degree Freemasons, he reveals the way the lower levels are misled: ' The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally mis-led by false interpretations. I t is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them ... Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.' 5 Exactly. Jim Shaw says that there are two kinds of Freemason. One just sits through the meetings and doesn't make much effort to understand the ritual. The other does all the work, but only keeps to the ritual, and memorises or reads the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 11 Figure 6: The Masonic Structure words without understanding what they really mean. That is correct, but there is a third kind: the very few who know the truth of who really controls Freemasonry and what the rituals and initiations are really designed to achieve. Shaw also confirms from his own experience how the Freemasons manipulate their own people into whatever positions they choose. At work, Shaw's department director, a fellow Freemason, advised him to apply for a particular job. Shaw felt he was under-qualified for the post and would fail the test paper.' Only through the urging of his Freemason boss did he apply. When he arrived to take the test he was amazed to see that there were only two other applicants for a job he believed would be keenly contested. When he turned over the test paper, he saw that the questions were very easy and he finished them quickly. His two rivals, however, were clearly finding the paper tough and could not complete it in the allotted time. Shaw got the j ob. Why? Because he was not given the same paper as the other two. When he walked out of Freemasonry after realising the scam, the opposite happened. He found his bosses far less supportive, to say the least. This is just one small example of how the Illuminati and their secret society web ensure that their"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 This 'world\" i s only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. All the major institutions and groups that affect our daily lives connect with the Illuminati, which decides the coordinated policy throughout the pyramid. People in the lower compartments will have no i dea what they are part of. Figure 7: Pyramids of Manipulation guys are in the positions that matter. It is actually astonishing how few people you need to control in order to dictate your agenda through the whole system if they are (a) in the key positions of decision-making and (b) they have the power to appoint those in the important positions below them. An example: you control the chief of police who decides the policy and he can appoint the heads of the various departments in his force. He introduces Illuminati policy and chooses his major subordinates from secret society initiates. They, in turn, can appoint the people within their departments and can thus choose more secret society initiates for the positions below them. So it goes on. Once you have control of the top man in any organisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminati's, image. Governments are structured in the same way, as are \"security\" organisations like the FBI, CIA, British Intelligence and those who control the Pentagon. They are compartmentalised pyramids in themselves, but there is also a pyramid that encompasses all of them and can therefore coordinate a common plan of action between them, exactly as it did on September 11th. Pyramids within pyramids Understanding the pyramid structure is vital to understanding how the few can manipulate the many on a global scale. The pyramid structure of secret societies is mirrored in government, banking, business and every other organisation and institution. It is like those Russian dolls with one doll inside a bigger one until the biggest doll encompasses them all. The Illuminati replace the `dolls' with pyramids (Figure 7). Every organisation today is a pyramid. Only the few at the top know the real agenda of the organisation and what it is trying to achieve.

They are only aware of the individual job they do every day. They don't know how their contribution (apparently innocent in isolation) connects with those of other employees in other areas of the company. They are compartmentalised from that knowledge and told only what they need to know to do their job. The only people who know how it all fits together are the very few sitting at the top - the bloodline families and their lackeys. The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger and bigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all of the banks. It is the same with the transnational corporations, political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military. If you go high enough in this structure all the transnational corporations (like the oil cartel), major political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military (via NATO, for instance), are controlled by the same families who sit at the top of the biggest pyramids. In the end there is a global pyramid that encompasses all the others, the biggest \"doll\" if you like. At the capstone of this you will find the most elite of the Illuminati, the \"purest\" of their bloodlines. In this way, they can coordinate through apparently unconnected, even \"opposing\" areas of society, the same policies because all roads lead eventually to them - everything from the food we eat; the water we drink; the \"medical care\" we receive, including vaccines; the \"news\" we watch and read; the \"entertainment\" we are given; the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will of the governments; and the hard drug network aimed at destroying young people. The same families and their gofers control all of these areas and so much more. This pyramid structure is how they have manipulated the explosion of centralisation in every area of life: government, finance, business, media and military. It is not by accident or natural occurrence, it is by coldly calculated design. The outstanding Australian journalist John Pilger produced a rare and excellent expose of globalisation for British Independent Television in July 2001 in which he pointed out that just 200 corporations are now responsible for a quarter of the world's economic activity. But there is another level to this that we urgently need to understand. This pyramid system means that those '200' corporations are, in effect, one Corporation controlled by the same force. Globalisation, which I and other \"conspiracy theorists\" were writing about long before it became fashionable, is just another name for the Illuminati's centralised global fascist state, which I have been exposing since the early 1990s. \"Glob alisation\" is not just a group of greedy corporations seeking to maximise profit, it is far, far, bigger than that. Manipulating the herd Most people find it impossible to accept that a few people can manipulate the lives of billions and operate through all institutions and countries. I understand that; but once you have the pyramids in place and you know how to condition the mind and reality of the population, it is relatively straightforward. When a few people wish to control and direct a mass of humanity there are certain key structures that have to be in place. These are the same whether you are seeking to manipulate an individual, family, tribe, town, country, continent or planet.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. you have to impose the 'norms', what is considered right and wrong, possible or i mpossible, sane or insane, good and bad. Most of the people will follow those ' norms' without question because of the baa-baa, herd mentality that has prevailed within the collective human mind for at least thousands of years. Second, you have to make life very unpleasant for those few who challenge your i mposed 'norms'. The most effective way to do this is to ensure that it is, in effect, a crime to be different. You make those who voice a different view, version of 'truth' and lifestyle, stand out like a black sheep in the human herd. You have already conditioned the herd to accept your norms as its reality and, through arrogance and ignorance, they ridicule or condemn those with a different spin on life. This pressurises the black sheep to conform and serves as a warning to those others in the herd who are also thinking of breaking away or challenging the prevailing reality. There is a Japanese saying that goes, \"Don't be a nail that stands out above the rest because that's the first one to get hit.\" I could not put it better. This fear of being different and voicing a view that challenges the \"norms\" is overwhelmingly the fear of what other people will think of us. In reality, the fear of what the sheep around us will say and do if we seek to leave the herd and question its conditioned assumptions. This mentality creates a situation fundamental to the few controlling the many because it means that the masses are policing themselves and keeping each other in line. The sheep become the sheepdog for the rest of the herd. It is like a prisoner trying to escape while the rest of his cellmates rush to stop him. If that happened we would say the prisoners were crazy, how could they do that? But humans are doing precisely the same to each other every day by demanding that everyone conform to the 'norms' to which they blindly conform. This is nothing less than psychological fascism - the thought police with agents in every home, everywhere. Agents so deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unpaid mind controllers. 'I'm just doing what's right for my children', I hear them say. No, what you have been programmed to believe is right for them and the belief, also, that only you know best. We see this same theme in our daily experiences of people in uniform and others from the masses who are promoted to power over the masses. It's summed up by the satirical version of the British Labour Party song The Red Flag, which goes: \"The working class can kiss my arse, I've got the foreman's job at last.\" This is all part of the divide and rule strategy so vital to ensuring that the herd will police itself. Everyone plays a part in everyone else's mental, emotional and physical i mprisonment. All the controllers have to do is set the 'norms', pull the right strings at the right time, and make their human puppets dance to the appropriate tune. This they do by dictating what is taught in what we bravely call 'education' and controlling what passes for 'news' through the Illuminati-owned media. In this way they can dictate to the unthinking, unquestioning herd what it should believe about itself, other people, life, history and current events.

I turned on the text service on the UK's Independent Television to see a story that I was appearing on the Sci-Fi Channel to speak about my \"bizarre\" views. Whoever wrote that report has never met me, never read my books, and has never done any investigation of these subjects for his or her self. But my views must be \"bizarre\" to this media person because they are different to those accepted. by their conditioned mind. Once you control what is considered 'normal' and possible, the whole system virtually runs itself. Obeying the law It is these hybrid Illuminati bloodlines, manifesting as political leaders and administrators of government, that introduce the 'laws' that will best serve their plan to keep humanity in ongoing servitude. The laws, which the masses have no say in creating, are then enforced by members of those same masses - soldiers, policemen, security guards and so on. These guys, and many women today, are mere system fodder. They are not encouraged to think for themselves and it would not be good for promotion if they did. They are paid to do as they are told, carry out orders and administer the letter of the 'law' - the law of the elite families. I remember watching a car park attendant at a botanical garden where many families were enjoying a Sunday afternoon out. He strode up and down constantly checking every car in turn looking for any that had outstayed their ticket. When he found one he was positively orgasmic. My father used to say that rules and regulations are for the guidance of the intelligent and the blind obedience of the idiot. But how many of those in the peaked caps administer the law in a sensible, every-case-on-its-merits, think-for-yourself manner? A mere fraction, and often they are far from popular with those higher up the ladder. Soldiers don't ask for j ustification for blowing away men, women and children they have never met and know nothing about (see Afghanistan, for example). They don't question their superiors about why they have to commit genocide. They just do it because they are told to do it and those doing the telling are themselves carrying out orders from those above them. In the end, all lines of command lead ever upwards to the 13 family bloodlines and their offshoots as they orchestrate their agenda to take over the planet. The sheeple The self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniform or administrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who impose their conditioning on their children and pressure them to follow their religious, political, economic and cultural 'norms'. One extreme example is those who insist that their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because of the rules of their ludicrous religion. There are the children of Jehovah's Witnesses who have been denied life- saving blood transfusions because their brain-dead parents insist on conducting every aspect of their lives according to the contradictory dictates of a book purveying so many stories of pure fantasy.

There are children of Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu parents who don't accept the religion, but still follow it because they don't want to upset their family. Then there is the almost universal fear of what people think of us if we speak a different version of reality or live a different kind of life. Note that the fear for those who wish to break out of the sheep pen is not the fear of what the elite families, the Illuminati or 'Illuminated Ones', will think of them. Most have no idea that such a network exists. No, the fear is of what their mother or father will think, or their friends and workmates - the very people who are conditioned by the system to stay in the pen. The sheep are keeping the other sheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyone who tries to escape. The herd goes to war - with itself It is so easy for a small group of interbreeding family bloodlines to control the lives (in other words, the minds) of billions, once the key institutions of 'information' are in place, as they have been for thousands of years in their various forms. There are not enough of these manipulators and their stooges to control the population physically and so they have had to create a structure in which humans control themselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical imposition. Once you have the herd mentality policing itself, there is a third phase in this entrapment of human consciousness. You create factions within the herd and set them to war with each other. This is done by creating 'different' belief systems (which are not different at all) and bringing them into conflict. These belief systems are known as religions, political parties, economic theories and 'isms' of endless variety. These beliefs are perceived as 'opposites' when, as I pointed out in my book, I Am Me, I Am Free, they are opposames. The vision of reality and possibility within the pen is so limited that it contains no opposites and the elite have to create the perception of them to manufacture the divisions that allow them to divide and rule. I mean, what is the difference between a Christian bishop, Jewish rabbi, Muslim or Hindu priest, or a follower of Buddha, imposing their beliefs on their children and others? There is none because while the belief they seek to indoctrinate may be slightly different, often very slightly, the overall theme is exactly the same - the imposition of one person's belief on another. Look at the opposames in politics. The Far Left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia, introduced centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. The 'opposite' of this was the Far Right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler. What did he impose? Centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. Yet these two opposames were set at war with each other amid propaganda that claimed they were opposites. The only difference between the Soviet Union and the so-called 'West' during the Cold War was that the Soviet Union was openly controlled by the few and the West was secretly controlled by the few. And when you get to the capstone of the pyramid you find they were the same few controlling both 'sides'. The same force operating through Wall Street and the City of London funded all 'sides' in the two world wars and that's provable (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Alice in Worrderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 So the methods of manipulation can be summarised thus: • \t You need to first imprison the human mind with a rigid belief and a fundamentally limited sense of reality -- the sheep pen. It doesn't much matter what these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigid and discourage free thought and open-minded questioning. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all the rest each make their contribution to human servitude while apparently claiming different 'truths'. • \t You encourage those who follow these rigid beliefs to impose them on others and make life very difficult and unpleasant for anyone who does not conform. • \t You bring these beliefs into conflict, so ensuring the divide and rule you so desperately need for control by the few. While the masses are busy fighting each other, and seeking to impose their beliefs and views on each other, they don't see that the Illuminati have strings attached to all of them. Humans are like moths buzzing around a light, so mesmerised by their religious belief, the football scores, the latest row on a soap opera, or the price of friggin' beer, that they fail to notice the preparations being made to smash them on the arse with a swatter. Problem-Reaction-Solution There are two techniques of mass manipulation that people need to understand if they are to begin to see through the game. One I have dubbed 'problem-reaction- solution' and the other I term the 'stepping-stones approach'. These have been used for thousands of years to advance the agenda and, together with fear, they remain the most effective weapons of the Illuminati. Since I first used the term problem- reaction-solution as an alternative to its previous name, the \"Hegelian Dialectic\", it has been constantly repeated among conspiracy researchers and others communicating the techniques of control. This is fantastic because to understand this simple, but devastating, method of human manipulation is to become so much harder to fool. Problem-reaction-solution is the key to understanding what really happened on September 11th 2001 and why. It works like this: you know that if you openly propose to remove basic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there will be a public reaction against it. So you don't openly and honestly propose such plans, you play the P-R-S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could be a country attacking another, a government or economic collapse, or a \"terrorist attack\". Anything in fact that the public will think requires a 'solution'. At stage t wo, you report the 'problems' you have covertly created in the way you wish the people to perceive them. Crucially you find someone to blame for the problem, a \"patsy\" like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy was assassinated or Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma. You spin the background to these events in a way that encourages the people to demand that \"something must be done\". These are the words you want to hear because they allow you to move on to stage three, the 17"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. Ws just a choice right now between fear and love. sting. At this point you openly offer the solutions to the problems you have yourself created. These solutions, of course, involve the centralisation of power, the sacking of officials or politicians that are getting in your way, and the removal of more basic freedoms as you advance further to your global fascist state. Just ponder on the freedoms that have been removed because of 9/11. A more subtle part of the technique is to propose far more extreme changes than you expect to get away with because this allows any opposition to think you have compromised and met them halfway. But you know that you have other \"problems\" in the pipeline to push the agenda on. With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people will demand or at least allow you to introduce what, in normal circumstances, they would vehemently oppose. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19th 1995 was a problem-reaction-solution classic, as I explained in And The Truth Shall Set You Free and will expand upon later. What followed the death and destruction in Oklahoma were \"anti-terrorism\" laws that sailed through Congress without challenge and removed fundamental freedoms from American people. Since September 11th this agenda has been advanced in gigantic leaps. I don't share the attitudes of people like Timothy McVeigh, nor do I defend disturbed people like Osama bin Laden, but that's not the point. Establishing the truth of what happened is the point, no matter what the views and attitudes of those involved. I think it is called justice. The two most effective problem-reaction-solutions in the 20th century were the two global wars. They changed the face of the world, as wars always do, and led to a massive centralisation of power. The United Nations, like its predecessor the League of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojan horse, or stalking horse, for world government. Media poodles ... woof, woof, lick, lick The media play their part to perfection in these 'problem-reaction-solution' scenarios. At ownership level, people like Conrad Black at the Hollinger Group and Rupert Murdoch of News international know what is going on. The editors they appoint might know something about it, as may certain columnists, but most of the j ournalists will have no idea. The editor is always there to block anything they write that is against the interests of the Illuminati - as directed by the owner - and if they insist on pursuing an unwelcome story they find themselves looking for another job. Most of the \"information\" that journalists present comes from official (Illuminati) sources anyway. In the immediate aftermath of a major event such as September 11th where are the reporters getting their information? From official sources. Name me a single piece of relevant information broadcast by the mainstream media about what happened on 9/11, how it was done, who did it and what the retaliation should be, that did not come from official sources. Exactly. Nothing. We are told that White House sources say this, FBI sources say that, and CIA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminati transmit through the media the version of events they wish the public to believe. These reports are blazed across the front pages of newspapers and the top of radio and television"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 19 news bulletins throughout the world, and what they say becomes the 'norm', the official \"history\". In the weeks and months that follow, researchers who are interested in the real truth begin to dig away. Over and over they establish and document the proof of how the official version was a lie from start to finish. But where are their reports published? In small-circulation newsletters, self-published books, and on radio stations that operate with a fraction of the money and potential audience of the Illuminati empires. Therefore, years after the official version has been demolished it still prevails in the public mind. Stop anyone in London, New York, Cape Town, Sydney, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September 11th, or in Oklahoma, the Second World War, or Kosovo. Almost every time they will give you the official story because that is the only one they have heard. Stepping stones The bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach. You know where you intend to lead people, but you realise that if you gave them the true picture or went there in one giant leap, you would, once again, face substantial opposition. So you travel to your destination in little steps and each one is presented in isolation and as unconnected to all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to global centralisation. This technique was used most obviously with the fascist superstate now known as the European Union. After the war if the politicians had suggested a centralised Europe with common laws and currency there would have been an outcry. People would have said they had been fighting Hitler to stop just such a European dictatorship and there was no way they were accepting another. To overcome this, the Illuminati offered a 'free trade area' and even used the problem of their manipulated world wars to encourage more cooperation between the countries of Europe. Once they had the free trade area, however, the foot in the door, they began to expand its powers until it became the fully fledged political and economic dictatorship that it is today. The same is happening with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), the 'free trade area' for Asia and Australia, and the same is planned for the African Union that replaced the Organisation of African Unity in 2001. 1 said in And The Truth Shall Set You Free in 1995 that the NAFTA 'free trade area' would be expanded to the whole of the Americas as the next stepping stone to a centrally controlled American Union. In 2001, George W. Bush, an Illuminati bloodline, attended the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, at which this expansion of NAFTA throughout the Americas was agreed. Look at today's newspapers and television news bulletins and you'll see the problem-reaction-solution and stepping-stones techniques played out day after day. One extremely effective way to see through this manipulation is to keep asking yourself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: 'Who benefits from me believing this version of events, or accepting the solutions and changes being offered as a result?' The answer will be almost every time: anyone who wishes to centralise power and suppress more of our freedoms."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"2 0 This \" world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and Jove. Blind faith Over thousands of years, religion has brilliantly served this structure for human control. Religions have created rigid belief systems that should never be questioned. They have imposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination, isolation, and the mass genocide of non-believers. They have fought each other for dominance of the human mind, thus producing an explosion of opportunity for the Illuminati to divide and rule for millennia. Another question: \"is it more likely that an Illuminati that has its origins in the ancient past, long before these religions were created, just happened to 'get lucky' when such a perfect vehicle for human control independently emerged? ... or is it rather more probable that these institutions of human enslavement were purposely created by these very same Illuminati to advance their agenda?\" Look at where the major religions originated - in the very Middle/Near East where the Illuminati had its ancient headquarters. In the aftermath of 9/11 we have seen Islam used to manipulate the people, and all the religions are used in the same way when the situation suits. But religion is not the conspiracy, and nor are economics, politics and all the rest. They are part of a vast web of interconnected manipulation designed to persuade the masses to put themselves in prison and throw away the key. The Illuminati work through every belief system - religious, political, economic, racial and cultural - and through every side in the major 'debates'. The reason is simple. If you want to know the outcome of a game before the game has even started, you need to control all sides. The manager of a football team cannot dictate the result if he only controls one side. If, however, he is managing both sides, he can ensure the result he wants before a ball is kicked. So it is with the Illuminati, the hidden hand behind the events that affect our lives and our world every day. We should be aware when contemplating the events in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania that the Illuminati operate through secret societies in the Near and Middle East every bit as much as they do in the United States and the so-called \"West\". We see this manipulation of both sides in the protests against globalisation. To control the public perception of these gathering protests the Illuminati have organised their own agents provocateur to start the violence we see on the news broadcasts. See my website www.davidicke.com for more detailed background to this, including the account of how mainstream journalists watched the police lines open at a protest in Spain to allow a group with weapons and masked faces to walk through to the peacefully protesting crowd. This group then started to attack each other, thus 'justifying' a police charge on the peaceful gathering in which people were battered by these uniformed head cases. Once the police intervention had begun, the journalists watched the group who started the trouble walk calmly back through the police lines to be driven away in police vehicles. One was asked if he was a policeman. \"Yes\" was his first reply when caught off-guard, but then he denied it. The manipulation of public perception goes on before our eyes minute by minute. September 11th was the most obvious example of this I have yet seen."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The real agenda behind 9/11 2 1 Fresh air \"money\" One of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control of humanity is the money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple and spans the period from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based on creating money that doesn't exist and lending it to people and businesses in return for interest. This creates an enormous debt for governments, business and the general population and you therefore control them. Vital to this has been permitting bankers to lend money they do not have. If you or me have a million pounds we can lend a million pounds. Very simple. But if a bank has a million pounds it can lend ten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even a fraction of the people who theoretically have money deposited in a bank went today to remove it, the banks would slam the door in half an hour because they don't have it. Money in the bank is a myth, another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bank does not print a single new note, nor mint a single new coin. It merely types the amount of the loan into your account. From that moment you are paying interest to the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, if you fail to pay back that non-existent loan, the bank can come along and quite legally take your wealth that does exist, your home, land, car and possessions, to the estimated value of whatever figure was typed on to that screen - plus interest. More than that, because money is not brought into circulation by governments, but by private banks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money is in circulation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money is in circulation. What is the difference between an economic boom (prosperity) and an economic depression (poverty)? One thing only - the amount of money in circulation. Through this system, the private banks, controlled by the same Illuminati families, decide how much money will be in circulation. They can therefore create booms and busts at will. It is the same with the stock markets through which these families are moving trillions of dollars a day around the financial and banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash. Stock market crashes don't just happen - they are made to happen. Why would the Illuminati do this when they have so much money invested in these markets? Well if you know the crash is coming because you are going to cause it, you know to sell at the highest point and buy back in once the crash has happened. In this way you can increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at a fraction of the cost before your manipulated collapse. Most of the \"money\" in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It is represented by figures passing from one computer account to another electronically via money transfers, credit cards and chequebooks. The more money, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economic activity can take place and the more products are bought and sold, the more income people have, and the more jobs are available. But a constant theme of this Illuminati financial. coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loans and then pulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economists and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"22 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. economic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tell you that boom and bust is part of some natural \"economic cycle\". It is not. It is systematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth of the world. During a boom many people get themselves into more debt. The vibrant economic activity means that businesses borrow more for new technology to increase production to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house and a more expensive car because they are so confident of their economic prospects. Then, at the most opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by the Illuminati network, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans and begin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewer loans than before. This has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in its various forms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leads to fewer j obs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate the necessary economic activity. People and businesses can no longer earn enough to repay their loans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their real wealth, their business, home, land, car and other possessions - in return for non-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen. This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the last few centuries, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of the population and into the hands of those who control the banking system - the Illuminati bloodline families. The same applies to countries. Instead of creating their own interest-free money, governments borrow it from the private banking cartel and pay the interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation of the people. A fantastic amount of the money that you pay in taxes goes straight to the private banks to pay back loans of \"money\" that governments could create themselves interest free! Why don't they do it? Simple. The Illuminati control the governments as much as they control the banks. What we call \"privatisation\" is the selling of state assets in response to bank-created debt. The world's poorest countries are handing over control of their land and resources to the Illuminati bankers because they can't pay back the vast loans made, on purpose, by the banks to ensnare them in this very situation. The world does not have to be in poverty and conflict. It is manipulated to be that way because it serves the agenda. \"Third World\" debt was manufactured to replace physical occupation of resource-rich or strategically situated countries under colonialism with today's financial occupation. The way they created this situation is told in detail in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Once a country is indebted to foreign banks, even though the money is non-existent credit, they are forced to hand over control of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy at every level. In the end all roads not only lead to the same cabal, they also lead to the same word: control. Criminal bankruptcy When you begin to look behind the movie screen or, more appropriately, under the stone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN. Some"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 23 researchers and lawyers suggest that in the 1930s the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many others officially declared bankruptcy, but somehow forgot to tell the people. This apparently happened during the five years of Geneva Conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and 1932, but it seems that they don't publish the volume containing details of the bankruptcy declarations. The bankers said that either the countries declared bankruptcy to the Illuminati banks or there would be no loans to get them out of the deep global depression at that time. So they accepted official bankruptcy to the global banking system and this meant, in effect, that the banks have owned those countries ever since.' Actually, I say countries. In fact, the United States is not a country, but a corporation, as revealed in my previous books and a stream of other published works and studies. No doubt we will find that the situation is the same in other countries too. This bankruptcy is actually in the United States Congressional Record of March 17th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303). James Traficant Jr of Ohio told the House: \" Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest reorganization of any Bankrupt entity in world history, the US Government. We are setting forth hopefully, a blueprint for our future.

This new form of government is known as a Democracy, being an established Socialist/Communist order under a new governor for America. This act was instituted and established by transferring and/or placing the Office of the Secretary of Treasury to that of the Governor of the International Monetary Fund.

The US corporation was created behind the screen of a \"Federal Government\" when, after the manufactured \"victory\" in the American War of Independence\", the British colonies exchanged overt dictatorship from London with the far more effective covert dictatorship that has been in place ever since. In effect, the Virginia Company, the corporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the former \"colonies\", simply changed its name to the United States and other related pseudonyms. These include, today, the United States, US, USA, United States of America, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and \"Feds\". The United States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia (Queen Semiramis) and the current president of the corporation is a man called George W. Bush. He is not the president of the people or the country as they are led to believe, that's just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a \"war on terrorism\" on behalf of a private corporation to further the goals of that Corporation. It had nothing to do with \"America\" and \"Americans\" because these are very different legal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the US military and everything else that comes under the term \"federal\". This includes the Federal Reserve, the \"central bank\" of the United States, which is, in reality, a private bank owned by controlling stockholders (and controllers of the US Corporation) that are not even American. This is the bank from which the United States Corporation borrows \"money\" that is repaid with interest by the unknowing American taxpayers. The Federal Reserve was manipulated into being in 1913 and dictates the US interest rate that has a massive knock-on effect on the rest of the world. The Federal Reserve or \"Fed\" is currently headed by Alan Greenspan, a member of Illuminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission. His predecessor was Paul W. Volker of ... the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The United States Corporation is owned by families and forces in Europe and the Jesuit-controlled Vatican is very much part of this covert ownership of not only the US, but major European \"countries\" also. Aye, aye, captain, er, judge The privately owned corporation known as the United States is the holding company, if you like, and the 50 states are its subsidiaries. Therefore these states also declared bankruptcy, or had it declared for them by the holding company, the \"Federal Government\", but the people never knew and still don't. You can get the detail about this elsewhere and I am only summarising the situation to give people an idea of how deep this conspiracy really goes. The sting has been set up so that when you register with the \"Federal Government\" in any way by accepting a Social Security number, driver's licence, or any of the other official federal documents, you"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The real agenda behind 9/11 25 are, unknowingly, agreeing to become an asset-employee of the United States Corporation. From that moment you become responsible for financing the corporation's state of bankruptcy. When you pay taxes or a court or parking fine and such like, you are servicing the bankruptcy by paying that money to \"government agencies\" that are nothing more than debt-collecting agencies for the \"creditor\" banks. The US court system operates under corporate law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to administer the bankruptcy and fleece the sheep to pay back the ongoing debt. This is also known as British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always has a gold fringe when displayed in the courts of the United States, and you find the same in government buildings and federally funded schools. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sitting under British Maritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code - military and merchant law not common or constitutional law. Under the Admiralty Law of Flags the flag displayed gives notice of the law under which the ship (in this case the court) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship (court) accepts by doing so that they are submitting to the law indicated by that flag. Judges refuse to replace the flag with one without a fringe when asked by defendants who know the score because that changes the law under which the court is sitting. If you appear in a court with a gold-fringed flag your constitutional rights are suspended and you are being tried under British Maritime (military/merchant) Law. The Uniform Commercial Code was approved by the American Bar Association, which is a franchise, a subordinate branch, of the British legal system and its hierarchy. As I have been writing for many years, the power that controls America is based in Britain and Europe (very much including the Vatican) because that is where the power is located that owns the United States Corporation. By the way, if you think it is strange that a court on dry land could be administered under Maritime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says that Admiralty Jurisdiction is applicable in the following locations: (1) the high seas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased. or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the state. In other words, mainland America. All this is founded on Roman law because the Illuminati have been playing this same game throughout the centuries wherever they have gone. The major politicians know that this is how things are and so do the government administrators, the judges and lawyers, and insider \"journalists\". Those who realise what is happening and ask the court for the name of the true creditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the \"legal system\" are always refused this information by the judge. The reason is simple. The true creditors in such cases and the ultimate recipient of the fines are the bankers to which the corporation \"country\" is bankrupt. This is why more and more people in the US are refusing to register in any way with the Federal Government as news and documentation of this bizarre situation continues to circulate.

Throughout this book I will refer to what is thought to be the government of \"America\" as the United States or the US and, when I talk of the \"US government\" and similar terms, I am referring to the privately owned United States Corporation that is masquerading as the \"government.\" It is not the government of a nation or country, it is a private corporation acting purely in the i nterests of the families that own and control it. The \"American\" president is simply the corporation's chief executive officer. What we can do There are two ways to meet a problem. We can look for a solution or, far more effectively, we can remove the cause. I go into these areas in detail in my other books and talks, and I will return to this at the end of this one. But one key \"cause\" we need to eliminate is the way we allow ourselves to be divided and ruled along the fault lines of race, religion, political persuasion, income bracket, and the other virtually endless list of human conflicts and divisions. If a major cause of human control is division then to remove it we must unite, si mple as that. We will never agree on everything and nor should we. What a boring world it would be if we did. But that does not mean we can't unite behind what we do agree on, and come together to protect and restore the freedoms that affect us all. Right wing, left wing, black, white, Christian, Muslim or Jew, everyone is a target for the Illuminati's global fascist state. Unless people stop fighting among themselves in their arrogant and meaningless battles for superiority, we will all be divided and ruled in a global version of Nazi Germany or Communist Russia and China. I don't care what your religion may be, or your race or political belief. Whatever it is, you are entitled to it and you can do what you like for all I care, so long as you don't seek to impose your will and belief on others. What I care about is the right of everyone to be free to follow his or her own freely chosen path through this Great Illusion we call the 'physical' world. But for each of us to be truly free, we all have to be truly free. The loss of another person's freedom is a loss of our own also. The murder of a child in Afghanistan is no less important than the murder of a child in New York, nor vice versa. We are in this together and we need to grow up and come together. The number of people knowingly manipulating the Illuminati agenda is a tiny fraction of the global population. They can only do it with our agreement and cooperation through self-interest, ignorance or terminal apathy. The pyramids of control are only there because we are holding them together. The power of a pyramid is at the bottom, not the top, yet we seem blind to that fact. The Illuminati are only up there because we are holding them up there. Our response must be peaceful because to meet violence with violence and hatred with hatred makes those who protest a mirror of those they protest against. What we fight we become, and it is vital that we don't fight the Illuminati and the global agenda, but instead cease to cooperate with it. Peaceful, united, non- cooperation with the system of control and dictatorship is by far the most effective means of bringing down these networks of power.

Postscript: During the first printing of this book, genealogists revealed in the media the blood connections between the Bush family and British royalty, the Spencer family of Princess Diana, and Winston Churchill. Colin Powell, they said, is related to England's Edward 1st and Richard Nixon to Edward III. This is all perfectly in line with the themes of my books.

John Adams B efore we begin our journey through the official fairytale of September 11th, we should look at some of the background to the \"world leaders\" who have dictated events before and since that terrible day. These are the men and women who have told us what happened on 9/11, who was responsible and what should happen as a result. Surely before we make decisions about what to believe we need to know if those who have peddled the official version of events can be trusted to tell us the truth. The next three chapters will be full of names and interconnecting subjects, and I can understand that some may find it overwhelming at times, but without this information it is not possible to appreciate the true context of September 11th and as this book unfolds that will become obvious. First of all, these \"world leaders\" are nothing like as powerful as people think they are, except over those below them in the Illuminati pyramid. Like all the personnel in government, even at apparently exalted levels, they are puppets of a higher authority in the hidden hierarchy that does not put itself on public display. The President of the United States, as with the Prime Minister of the UK and elsewhere, is a position for lieutenants of the Illuminati, not generals or colonels. They are used to play out the game in the public arena and, so long as they do that and say what they are told to say, their careers will flourish and their horrendous secrets will remain \"in-house\". Fail to serve the dragon, however, and you press the self-destruct button, as with John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby. There are those, like the Bush family and Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, who willingly and enthusiastically dance to the Illuminati tune and take the \"power\" and rewards that come with that. Others are caught in the web and believe there is nothing they can do except comply.

The Bush family The Bushes have been one of the most active Illuminati families, at a \"gofer\" level, for at least the last century or so. They have produced two US presidents and as both are called George Bush I will overcome the potential confusion in the text by calling George H.W. Bush either George Bush or \"Father George\", and I'll refer to his son, the current incumbent, as George W. Bush, \"Boy George\", or \"Dubya\". As U.S presidents go, Father George is quite high up in the Illuminati compared with most of them, but he's still small fry compared with those who really call the shots. His son, George \"Dubya\", of course, can just about summon the brain-cell activity to tie his shoelaces. I blame the inbreeding myself. Father George and wife Barbara are both descendants of Godfroi de Boullion (also known as Godfrey of Boullion) who, in 1099, led European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Islamic faith and moved into the King's palace at Temple Mount, the alleged site of Solomon's Temple, which has been an historic obsession for the Illuminati that continues to the present time. Understanding this obsession is to understand so much about the terrible events in Jerusalem and the focus on Temple Mount by the religions of Christian, Jew and Muslim. Godfroi de Boullion was the first King of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major region for the Illuminati bloodline to this day (see The Biggest Secret). So when George W. Bush, a descendant of de Boullion through both his mother and father, talked of a \"Crusade\" against \"Islamic\" terrorism after September 11th, that was no slip of the tongue or unfortunate gaffe as it was reported. He knew exactly what he was saying and why. From this \"Crusade\" by de Boullion came the secret society called the Knights Templar, which is widely exposed in my other books. The Knights Templar is still a major arm of the Illuminati today with top people in global politics, banking, business and media among its initiates. It was largely through the Knights Templar that the Freemasons, the world's biggest secret society, emerged. George and Barbara Bush are from the Pierce bloodline that changed its name from Percy after fleeing England in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot led by Guy Fawkes (or so they say) to blow up the English Parliament and kill King James I in 1605. This event is still celebrated in the UK every November 5th when effigies of Guy Fawkes are burned on bonfires all over the country. The Bush ancestor Thomas Percy was one of the main plotters. George and Barbara Pierce Bush (of Merrill, Lynch, Fenner and Smith) are from the same bloodline as the US President, Franklin Pierce, who was in the White House from 1853 to 1857. Other Bush relatives include the Grosvenor families of England and America, the Tafts of Ohio, who produced William Howard Taft, president from 1909 to 1913, and the Delano-Roosevelts, who provided President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933-45) and Theodore Roosevelt (1901-19). The English Grosvenors are the Dukes of Westminster who own prime properties in the City of London, one of the main financial and secret society centres"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30 This \" world' is only an illusion and we can change it any ti me we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. for the Illuminati globally. The Grosvenors of America founded the National Geographic which is notorious for removing the archaeological treasures of the world, especially those with religious significance, and relocating them at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. The Institute is controlled by those Grosvenor cousins, the Smithsons, who in turn are descended from the Percys - the Pierce bloodline that produced the Bushes.' The ancestry of both George Bushes can also be traced to England's Alfred the Great and to Charlemagne, a highly significant figure in the Illuminati and bloodline story, and from whom 34 of the 43 US presidents are descended. With both his father and mother having such serious royal and aristocratic ancestry, this gives Baby George a mass of bloodline connections, as documented by Burke's Peerage. The Bushes are related to the British royal family, who are big-time Illuminati, and the two are very close. Documents apparently exist that reveal Bushh family business dealings with the Queen of England through Coutts Bank in London and if anyone can give me more details about that then please let me know. Dark secrets galore The Bushes have long been pillars of the infamous Skull and Bones Society based in a windowless mausoleum known as \"the Tomb\" alongside the campus at Yale University at New Haven in Connecticut. Every year 15 bloodline students are initiated into the Skull and Bones Society and the ratio of Skull and Bones initiates who end up in positions of power in politics, banking, business, media and intelligence agencies in the United States, in front of camera and behind the scenes, is massively greater than the general student population. George W. Bush is a Skull and Bones initiate (code name \"Temporary\" interestingly), along with Father George Bush, and the president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, one of the funders of Adolf Hitler. Prescott Bush is most famous within the Skull and Bones \"Order\" for raiding the grave of the Native American Apache leader Geronimo. In May 1918 Prescott Bush and five other Skull and Bones men ransacked the grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. They took turns to stand guard while others robbed the grave and took away artefacts and Geronimo's skull. This was taken to the Skull and Bones headquarters at Yale where it is used in their sick rituals and ceremonies. This horrible story is told in an internal history of the Skull and Bones Society and was quoted to Ned Anderson, the Tribal Chairman of the San Carlos Apache tribe, when he was negotiating to have Geronimo's remains returned to the tribe's custody. A 1989 article in the New Yorker said: \"One Bonesman ... recalled during the early 70s seeing perhaps 30 skulls, not all of them human, scattered about the Tomb [at Yale].\" I This is the mentality of the people running our world. The Bush men also have a long association with the diabolical rituals performed by the Illuminati bloodlines every July at a place called Bohemian Grove, located in 2,700 acres of very secluded redwood forest near the hamlet of Monte Rio in Sonoma County, 75 miles north of San Francisco. This is a ritual and sexual playground for leading American and foreign politicians, mobsters, bankers, businessmen, media owners and editors, top entertainers, etc., who are initiates of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The Bush family crime 31 the Illuminati or serve the agenda in some form. Among them are people like Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan; Vice President Dick Cheney; Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Casper Weinberger and Bush family crony, James Baker; Alexander Haig, the former US Defense Secretary; Alan Greenspan, the head of the Illuminati's US \"central bank\", the Federal Reserve; David Rockefeller, Illuminati manipulator for at least 50 years; television news anchorman Walter Cronkite; David Gergen, author and adviser to presidents for 30 years and. editor-at-large at US News and World Report; and presidents of major media operations like CNN and the Associated Press. In July 1991, Dirk Mathison, the San Francisco bureau chief of People magazine, owned by the Illuminati's Time-Warner, sneaked into the Grove three times. On the third occasion he was recognised by a Time Warner executive who threw him out and his story was not allowed to appear. Mathison said that John Lehman, a former secretary of the Navy, delivered a lecture at the Grove that revealed how the Pentagon estimated 200,000 Iraqis had been killed a few months earlier in the Gulf War - a figure not made public. Another speaker at the secret Grove gathering was Al Neuharth, the founder of USA Today, who was identified in the official programme as chairman of the Freedom Forum - a $700-million foundation dedicated to a \"free press\"! Cathy O'Brien, who was a mind-controlled slave of the Illuminati for some 30 years, tells in her book, Trance-Formation Of America,' of how she and her fellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusers at Bohemian Grove. These include satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture and blood drinking. Cathy says in her book: \"Slaves of advancing age or with failed programming were ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Grove and I felt it was only a matter of time before it would be me.\" She says that the Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, including a Dark Room, a Leather Room, a Necrophilia Room and one known as the Underground Lounge, spelt as U.N.derground on the sign. I know this sounds seriously far out to peoples' conditioned sense of reality, but if you read The Biggest Secret and Children Of The Matrix, as well as many other books by other researchers and victims, you will see the enormous evidence to support all. this. I will explain why they are obsessed with rituals and blood drinking in the final chapter. These bloodlines can be shown to have been involved in these sickening human sacrifice rituals since Babylon and before, and it continues to this day. In The Biggest Secret there is a photograph of robed and hooded men at the Grove standing alongside a large fire while worshipping a 40-foot stone owl - an ancient Illuminati symbol. These world- famous Illuminati initiates at Bohemian Grove burn and sacrifice a human \"effigy\" under the owl at the start of their \"summer camp\" every year. This happens during a Babylonian-type ritual called the Cremation of Care and in the year 2000 Alex Jones, an American radio talk show host, took a hidden camera into the Grove and fil med the ritual. He was too far away to see if the sacrifice was an \"effigy\" or real, but the human sacrifice rituals go on among the elite of the elite in much more secret and secluded locations during the \"camp\". The Jones footage clearly shows"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. the bizarre opening ritual and the sound quality is particularly good. At one point an \"effigy\" is floated on a boat across the lake at Bohemian Grove where it is placed under the giant owl and set on fire. At this point you hear very clearly a blood- curdling scream and one of two things are happening here. They are either sacrificing a human being in the guise of an \"effigy\" or they broadcast the sound of the scream of agony as part of the ceremony. Either way, these are the people running our world! President George W. Bush, like his father and grandfather, is a Bohemian Grove attendee and arrived there shortly after the video was shot. The Jones footage appeared in a television documentary on the UK's Channel 4 in 2001, a programme that skimmed the surface of what really goes on at the Grove and missed a wonderful opportunity. Alex Jones has a tendency to scream at the camera, which doesn't help his case, but he does some great work informing Americans of their plight. His own video of the Bohemian Grove footage is far better than the UK Channel 4 version and is well worth seeing. It is available through Infowars.com The Bush drug network Among the most important functions of the Bush family and the Skull and Bones Society is putting illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin on the streets of America and around the world. It was very wealthy aristocratic and other Illuminati bloodline families in Britain and the United States that launched the global drug trade and still control it. They use their government agencies to \"bust\" any opposition and leave the field clear for themselves. This is what is happening when you hear news reports of a \"big drug find\" or some villain or network being jailed for trafficking. The real players never get hit because they also control law \"enforcement\". The Illuminati drug-running network not only makes vast sums to fund covert projects, it also destroys lives on a massive scale, and creates fear and divide and rule through the enormous division and crime generated by those who steal, rob and mug in a desperate attempt to get the money to feed their addiction. The Skull and Bones Society is owned by the Russell Trust, an organisation controlled by the Russells, a drug-running bloodline family. They flew the skull and bones flag on their ships as they transported drugs for the British Empire from Turkey to China and elsewhere during the Opium Wars of the 19th century. The skull and bones is an ancient Illuminati symbol used in its sacrificial rituals and secret language, not least by the Knights Templar. Samuel Russell launched Russell and Company in 1823 and within seven years it had absorbed the Perkins opium syndicate based in Boston. Russell's head of operations in Canton, China, was Warren Delano Jr, the grandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US President during the Second World War who was related to the Bush family. Roosevelt was also a cousin of his fellow wartime leader, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Other famous families (Illuminati bloodline) were partners in the Russell drug network - names like Coolidge, Forbes, Perkins, Low and Sturgis. It was Samuel Russell's cousin, William Huntington, and the Bush-related Alphonso Taft, the father of President William Howard Taft, who established the Order of the Skull and Bones in the US in 1832 and attracted America's major bloodline families to its dark rituals and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Afice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime 33 grotesque agenda - families that have dominated American politics, business, banking, and covert intelligence operations. They include the Rockefellers, Harrimans, Tafts, Lords, Kelloggs, Goodyears, Whitneys, Vanderbilts, Bundys, Sloanes, Perkins, and ... Bushes. The Skull and Bones men have always had a very close association with the US intelligence community and one of its most famous, or infamous, members is Father George Bush, who served the Illuminati and crimes against humanity as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. (You'll find the detailed and sourced background to the Skull and Bones Society and the Bush connections in And The Truth Shall Set You Free.) Prescott Bush, funder of Hitler The current president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a Senator for Connecticut, the home of the Skull and Bones Society. He was a golf partner of President Dwight D. \"Ike\" Eisenhower, a military man who, like Colin Powell, enjoyed a fantastic rise to prominence because of his Illuminati sponsors. But \"Ike\" disappeared from view after he warned about the dangers to freedom posed by the \"Military-Industrial Complex\" (the Illuminati) in the closing days of his presidency. Prescott Bush was a keen and active supporter of the eugenics (master race) movement along with his bloodline associates, the Harrimans and Rockefellers. It was this clique, led by the Rockefellers, that funded the work of Adolf Hitler's race \"purity\" expert, Ernst Rudin, to such an extent that he could occupy an entire floor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin. Soon after Hitler had abolished elections and become dictator of Germany in 1933, the Rockefeller-funded, Bush and Harriman-supported, Dr Rudin was commissioned to write the Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity, which involved the forced sterilisation of anyone considered genetically inferior. Father George's massive funding of \"population control\" programmes is another modern example of this family obsession. Once again the detailed and horrific story of the master race movement supported by the Bushes, Harrimans, and Rockefellers is told in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Harry S. Truman, by the way, the Freemasonic President who ordered the atomic bombing of Japan, was a Rockefeller cousin. Prescott Bush was involved in supporting eugenics and Hitler's crazed master race \"philosophy\", and he was directly involved in funding the Nazi war machine. All sides in the First and Second World Wars were funded by the same people, mainly through sources in Wall Street and the City of London (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The Illuminati use wars to change the face of society and create the opportunity to introduce their agenda of constant centralisation of power through the technique of problem-reaction-solution. They manipulate peoples and countries into conflict and fund the genocide until the status quo society is destroyed. Once that is achieved they can rebuild that society in line with their agenda. This is what the two world wars of the 20th century and the endless other conflicts have really been about - including Afghanistan and the \"war on terrorism\". Prescott Bush helped to finance Hitler through a company called the Union Banking Corporation (UBC). Fritz Thyssen, a German steel entrepreneur and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34 This \"world\" i s only an iliusion and we can change it anytime. , we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. banker, funded the Nazis from the early 1920s. His banking operation in Germany was affiliated through a subsidiary with the W.A. Harriman Company in New York ( Brown Brothers, Harriman after 1933), which in turn was funded, at least in its earlier days, by the House of Rothschild. The Harriman family was prominent in supporting the Russian Revolution, Adolf Hitler and the master race insanity of the eugenics movement. A Fritz Thyssen company controlled the Union Banking Corporation in the US, which had E. Roland Harriman (Skull and Bones Society) on its board along with known Nazis and Nazi financial backers. Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of the future presidents, was also on the UBC board and owed his wealth to the Harrimans. The trio of Brown Brothers Harriman, the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm headed by Rockefeller cousin John Foster Dulles, and the Union Banking Corporation of Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker (Father George's grandfather), represented the interests of the Nazi business cartels in the United States at the time of the Second World War. John Foster Dulles would become US Secretary of State while his brother, Allen, was the first head of the CIA! In 1942 the government seized UBC assets under the Trading With The Enemy Act, and stopped George Walker and Prescott Bush pouring money into Hitler's regime - at least in theory. Eight days later, two other Bush-managed companies, the Holland- American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation, were seized for the same reason. These were followed by another Bush-Harriman operation, the Silesian-American Corporation. The Bush-Nazi connection was highlighted again more recently by John Loftus, the president of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bush derived a portion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with a Nazi-controlled bank. Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department's Nazi War Crimes Unit, confirmed that Prescott Bush was a principal in the Union Banking Corporation in Manhattan in the late 1930s and the 1940s, and that leading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the bank at the time. He said they were moving money into the UBC through a second bank in Holland even after the United States declared war on Germany. The bank was liquidated in 1951, Loftus said, and President Bush's grandfather and great-grandfather received $1.5 million as part of that dissolution. He said he had a file of paperwork linking the bank and Prescott Bush to Nazi money. \"That's where the Bush family fortune came from: it came from the Third Reich,\" Loftus said in a speech during the Sarasota Reading Festival.' In his book, Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, The Nazis and the Swiss Banks, Loftus documented the Swiss bank accounts that harboured funds confiscated from concentration camp victims, and the involvement of Italian priests in smuggling Nazi war criminals to safe havens in Canada, Central and South America, and the United States after the war. This is also detailed in And The Truth Shall Set You Free, which, like Loftus, exposes the Nazi connections of other prominent American Illuminati families, most notably the Rockefellers and the Kennedys. One member of the audience who heard Loftus in Florida, Nancy Krauss from Punta Gorda, said: \"I am absolutely shocked. 1 wish this would have come out before the election. My husband voted for Bush. I don't think he would have voted for him if he would"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime 35 have known.\"' If people knew what the Bush family had really done, and are still doing, they would all be in jail with the key hurled into a very deep ocean. Funding the Russian Revolution The Harrimans and their close associate, Prescott Bush, also helped to fund the Russian Revolution. E. Roland Harriman was the brother of W. Averill Harriman (Skull and Bones Society), who was a director of a company called the Guaranty Trust when it was financing Lenin and Trotsky to trigger the Russian Revolution (another Illuminati problem-reaction-solution). Half the board members of Brown Brothers Harriman and their fellow Russian Revolution financers, J.P. Morgan, were Skull and Bones initiates. Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and Percy Rockefeller, were in the same Bonesmen group. Averill Harriman, the Henry Kissinger of his day, would later make vast profits from Russian ventures and be appointed US Ambassador to the Soviet Union to advance Illuminati interests there. The US and Soviet governments were on different \"sides\" in the \"Cold War\"? Sure they were. It was all a game to dupe the people. Averill Harriman was also a controlling voice in the Democratic Party and dictator to President Franklin Roosevelt, he of the drug- running Illuminati bloodline related to the Bushes. Harriman's wife, Pamela, who died while US ambassador to Paris in 1997, was extremely influential in Bill Clinton's rise to the presidency, which is why he made her Ambassador to France as a pay back. In turn, her husband, Averill, a \"Democrat\", was very much a mentor to Prescott Bush and the Bush family in general, who are \"Republicans\". As one headline at the time of Bill Clinton's run for president put it: \"Bush Camp Finances Clinton Campaign\".' Like I say, the United States, as with the UK and other countries, is a one-party state masquerading as a free society. Whoever you vote for the government still gets in: the Illuminati government. Pamela Harriman was also married to Randolph Churchill, son of Britain's wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (bloodline and cousin to Franklin Roosevelt) and she had affairs with the Italian Fiat boss Giovanni Agnelli (bloodline and major Illuminati major operative) and Baron Elie de Rothschild (bloodline and Illuminati operative), among a string of others. When you move in Illuminati circles, it is a very small world. George H.W. Bush - \"Father George\" This was the background into which George Herbert Walker Bush arrived in this world on June 12th 1924. He was groomed from birth to serve the Illuminati in a long list of roles, including US Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican Party at the time of the Watergate hearings, Director of the CIA, and Vice President and President of the United States. The Herbert Walker in his name comes from his grandfather, George Herbert Walker (Skull and Bones Society), another man heavily involved with Prescott Bush in the manipulation of the Russian Revolution, the expansion of the eugenics movement and the funding of Hitler. The golf trophy called the Walker Cup is named after him. Wherever you look in George Bush's life you find Illuminati operatives, human sacrificers, child abusers and orchestrators of genocide. George Bush himself is all of these, as my"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. books and others have well detailed. Father George is very much a power behind the throne during the presidency of his son, who is only doing what others tell him. I will summarise here just a few of the crimes against humanity inflicted by Father George Bush and his dominant partner, Henry Kissinger, another genocidal maniac. It will give you a flavour of the true mentality behind September 11th and the subsequent \"war on terrorism\". Bush served the Illuminati in China while Kissinger and the Chinese were supporting Pol Pot in the genocidal war on Cambodia that led to the systematic extermination of millions of Cambodians. Bush returned home in 1975 when he received a telegram from Kissinger saying that he was being nominated by President Ford (Kissinger in other words) to be Director of the CIA. Bush held the post in 1976 and 1977 and he is so fundamentally involved in CIA activities to this day that in 1999 its headquarters compound at Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence. Maybe his son should join, he could do with some. The Central Intelligence Agency is part of the so-called \"Inner Fed\" of the secret government that consists of the CIA, the National Security Agency, FBI, NASA and the Federal Reserve \"Central Bank of America\". It is through \"umbrella\" structures like the \"Inner Fed\" - the pyramids - that a coordinated policy and response can be conducted between apparently unconnected agencies and organisations. Much of the funding of this cartel of manipulation comes from its involvement in the drugs trade, which the intelligence agencies and bloodline families like the Bushes control. Father George Bush was not new to the intelligence game and his connections with the CIA would appear to go back to the 1950s or even much earlier given the Skull and Bones Society connection to the US intelligence community. In The Immaculate Deception,' Russell S. Bowen names Bush as a top CIA agent since before the agency's failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba on April 17th 1961, which turned President Kennedy's attention to reforming the CIA. Bowen, a retired brigadier general who did some of the Bush family's dirty work, says that Bush worked with a man named Felix Rodriguez and other anti-Castro Cubans.' Intriguingly, the top secret code name of the Bay of Pigs invasion was \"Operation Zapata\". Bush's oil company was called Zapata Oil. Rodriguez would turn up again in the Iran-Contra arms-for-drugs scandal during the Reagan-Bush administration, which made vast quantities of hard drugs available to the young people of the United States. When you look at the personnel in the \"Plumbers Group\" involved in the Watergate break-in in 1972, a remarkable number of them were also involved in the Bay of Pigs debacle. William Buckley, a CIA coordinator, said that if he told what he knew about the Bay of Pigs and. the Kennedy assassination \"it would be the biggest scandal ever to rock the nation\".\" Buckley would later be assassinated in the Middle East. There is plenty of evidence that George Bush was a long-time CIA asset since before the Kennedy assassination when the family friend and Hitler supporter, Allen Dulles, was head of the CIA. The Dulles family are bloodline and cousins to the Rockefellers. President Kennedy sacked Allen Dulles in a purge in which JFK threatened to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces, but before he could do that he was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, in 1963 and the same"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush (amity come 37 Allen Dulles was appointed to the Warren Commission to decide who killed him! There is evidence to suggest that George Bush was far closer to the Kennedy assassination than people have believed.\" Father George at the CIA From his office at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Bush put together his team. Among them was the infamous Theodore Shackley, whom Bush named as the CIA's associate deputy director for covert operations. Shackley had been the head. of the CIA station in Miami during the early 1960s, from where E. Howard Hunt and his fellow Watergate burglars would emerge. Shackley went on to head the CIA station in Saigon during the Vietnam War where he masterminded Operation Phoenix. This involved the death of tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians who were \"suspected\" of working for the Viet-Cong. (Just being able to read and write was enough to invite this suspicion, apparently.) Oliver North, the \"star\" of the Iran-Contra affair, worked with Shackley on Operation Phoenix, which is reputed to have murdered 40,000 Vietnamese villagers. Shackley ran a huge assassination and drug operation in South-East Asia in the 1970s in which two other Bush men, Donald Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, were involved. This operation was threatened by President Kennedy seeking to withdraw from Vietnam, the Illuminati war that cost the lives of 50,000 Americans and two million Vietnamese. Bush appointed the same Theodore Shackley to an important position in his CIA and Shackley would later be recruited as Bush's speechwriter during the 1979-80 election campaign. The idea that someone like Shackley would be hired to write Bush's speeches defies the i magination. No doubt his other \"talents\" were the real reason for his presence. The last I heard, Shackley was living in Medellin, Columbia, home of the drug cartel. How thoroughly appropriate. Thomas Clines, a former second in command at the CIA station in Miami, was another Bush appointee at the CIA who would be involved in Iran-Contra, a scandal Bush was to say he knew nothing about. During Bush's tenure at the CIA, the operatives knew they could do virtually as they liked because their Director had a gift for looking the other way. The power over the US intelligence operations was concentrated in Bush's hands as a result of a series of measures introduced by President Ford, a front man for the mob and an abuser of mind-controlled women (see The Biggest Secret and Trance-Formation Of America). In the words of the New York Times, Ford: \"...centralized more power in the hands of the Director of Central Intelligence than any had had since the creation of the CIA\".` Among Bush's CIA operatives in South America was the infamous Nazi \"Butcher of Lyon\", Klaus Barbie, who had escaped from Europe thanks to US (Illuminati) intelligence. It was he who masterminded the so-called \"cocaine-coup\" in Bolivia in June 1980 and he used the profits from CIA-supported drug networks to finance the neo-Nazi overthrow of the government in Argentina when, according to former US Drug Enforcement agent, Mike Levine, the coup was achieved by troops wearing Nazi armbands.\" Another Illuminati front operation closely connected to Bush is Sun Myung Moon's \"Moonie Church\", which is connected to many prominent politicians around the world, including Ted Heath, the former Prime"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Minister of the UK from 1970 to 74 (See The Biggest Secret and Children Of The Matrix). Bo Hi Pak, Moon's right-hand man, was among the first to arrive in La Paz after the Barbie-Bush \"cocaine-coup\" in Bolivia. Moon, it is claimed, invested $4 million in the coup and was to massively finance Bush's run for the presidency in 1988. The Washington Times newspaper, so supportive of Bush, is owned by the Moonies. 14 The contacts George Bush made at the CIA would be invaluable when he became Vice President to Ronald Reagan on January 21st 1981. Reagan's personal fortune dates from a time shortly after becoming Governor of California when he bought some land cheaply and sold it at a vast profit to a group of benefactors who have never been publicly identified.\" Reagan, a former B-movie actor, was a long- ti me member of Bohemian Grove and an initiate of the Knights of Malta. This is another a very significant strand in the Illuminati web. Reagan was 70, the oldest man to be inaugurated as President. His mind was failing and he needed long afternoon naps each day. Almost everything Reagan said, even in relatively off-the- cuff situations when greeting foreign leaders, was written for him on cue cards by his aides. George Bush was president in all, but name. After the assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981, his mind further deteriorated. This gave Bush almost complete control of affairs and in the background was the power behind the throne: his mentor, Henry Kissinger. Reagan's would-be assassin, John Hinckley, had connections to the Bush family. Father George built a network of organisations within the government with himself at the head. These were the Standing Crisis, Pre-Planning Group, the Crisis Management Center, the Terrorist Incident Working Group, the Task Force on Combating Terrorism and the Operations Sub-Group. These were subordinate to, and controlled by, the Special Situation Group chaired by Bush. If ever there was a line-up of problem-reaction-solution \"organisations\", then this was it. Through this network would come the arms-for-drugs operation known as Iran-Contra in which the Reagan-Bush administration illegally sold arms to the hostile regime in Iran (hostile in public anyway) and used the money they received to illegally fund and arm the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua who were fighting to overthrow the elected Sandinista government that the Illuminati wanted removed. In return for this vital support, the Contras supplied US government agencies controlled by George Bush with drugs for distribution on the streets of America and elsewhere. Iran-contra The now Vice President Bush hired his former CIA associate, Donald P. Gregg, as his main adviser on \"national security\" and Gregg brought with him a \"former\" CIA assassinations manager, Felix Rodriguez, whom Bush had known back to the ti me of the Bay of Pigs invasion and his period as head of the CIA. Gregg and Rodriguez were involved with Theodore Shackley in the assassination and drug- running operation in South-East Asia in the Vietnam War era. The two now worked out of George Bush's office! It was strictly illegal under US law for the government to supply arms to Iran or to fund and arm the Nicaraguan \"freedom fighters\" (terrorists) called the Contras in their war with the Sandinista"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 39 government. It was certainly illegal to accept payment with drugs in return. The Reagan-Bush administration would do all of these things. One of the ways the Bush-controlled \"Reagan\" government secretly undermined the Sandinistas was by mining harbours in Nicaragua. A company called Continental Shelf Associates, Inc., which is based on Jupiter Island, Florida, carried out these covert operations. Jupiter Island is an interesting place. It became the fiefdom of the Harriman set, including George Bush, who has a home there. Jupiter Island has been a base for generations of Illuminati families. Continental Shelf Associates (CSA) lists many oil companies and government agencies among its clients. They include the Rockefellers' Exxon and the Bush-connected oil company Pennzoil. CSA was used by the US military for coastal mapping and reconnaissance in Grenada before the Reagan-Bush invasion in October 1983 and during US operations in the Lebanon. The company was run by Robert \"Stretch\" Stevens. He was a close associate of Theodore Shackley and Felix Rodriguez when they were all involved in South-East Asia and the Bay of Pigs invasion. A CSA company at the same address is Acta Non Verba, which means \"action, not words\". A high-level CIA officer quoted by Anton Chaitkin and Webster Griffin Tarpley, in George Bush, The Unauthorised Biography, said of this CSA subsidiary: \"Assassination operations and training company controlled by Ted Shackley, under cover of a private corporation with a regular board of directors, stockholders, etc, l ocated in Florida. They covertly bring in Haitian and South East Asian boat people as recruits, as well as Koreans, Cubans, and Americans. They hire out assassination and i ntelligence services to governments, corporations, and individuals ...\" 16 Again, Father Bush's close friend Shackley is involved. The bombs planted in the harbours of Nicaragua caused such a row in the US that the laws against such action, the Boland Laws as they were called, were further strengthened. But at a secret meeting of the National Planning Group on June 25th 1984, Bush, Reagan and their top officials decided to ignore the law. They would fund the Contras through Honduras, just as they had used El Salvador against the Sandinistas. Bush and Oliver North, an official of the National Security Council, travelled together to El Salvador. On January 18th 1985 the Bush-appointed Felix Rodriguez is known to have met his name sake (but not thought to be a relative), Ramon Milian Rodriguez, an accountant and money launderer who worked for the Medellin drug cartel. This meeting was confirmed by Felix Rodriguez and reported in the Miami Herald on June 30th 1987. From his cell in Butner, North Carolina, Ramon told investigative j ournalist, Martha Honey: . ..[Felix offered] ... in exchange for money for the Contra cause he would use his i nfluence in high places to get the [cocaine] cartel US goodwill ... Frankly, one of the selling points was that he could talk directly to Bush. The issue of goodwill wasn't something that was going to go through 27 bureaucratic hands. It was something that was directly between him and Bush.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. This could easily be done given that Felix Rodriguez was working from Bush's office. A memo in early September 1986 sent to Oliver North by retired Army Major General John K. Singlaub, said that Rodriguez was talking of having \"daily contact\" with Bush's office and this, said the memo, could damage President Reagan and the Republican Party. Oliver North would also write in his notebook: \"Felix has been talking too much about the VP [Vice President]\".\" In her 1987 book, Out Of Control former CBS News Producer Leslie Cockburn presents devastating evidence of Bush's involvement in Iran-Contra and drug running. She says that planes chartered by the CIA and packed with cocaine flew directly into the Homestead Air Force Base in Florida using a CIA code signal. Colonel Albert Carone, who was later murdered, said in a sworn statement that he remembered seeing Oliver North make more than 20 entries in his diary detailing how drug profits were being used to buy weapons for the Contras. He said that an entry for July 5th 1985 noted that \"$14 million to buy arms came from drugs\". 19 In 1986, the Reagan-Bush administration admitted that Adolfo \"Popo\" Chamorro's Nicaraguan Contras, the terrorists supported by the CIA, were helping a Colombian drug-trafficker to transport drugs into the United States, and the testimony of John Stockwell, a former high-ranking CIA official, revealed that drug smuggling was an essential component of the CIA operation with the Contras. George Morales, one of South America's biggest traffickers, testified that he was approached in 1984 to fly weapons to the Contras. In return, he says, the CIA helped him to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine into the United States via an airstrip on the ranch of John Hull, a self-confessed CIA agent and associate of Oliver North. As Michael Ruppert, a former drugs specialist with the Los Angeles Police Department, said: \"The CIA and Ronald Reagan and [CIA Director] Bill Casey and Vice-President George Bush were running the whole operation, we know that now. They circumvented the will of Congress and there was an explosion of drug trafficking all throughout Central America, coordinated by the CIA.\" 20 Meanwhile, the other aspect of Iran-Contra was continuing to illegally trade arms for hostages with Iran. Oliver North was heavily involved in the supply of arms to Iran, via Israel, in return for hostages. The release of the hostages was explained in part by the efforts of Terry Waite, the representative of Britain's Archbishop of Canterbury. Waite was being used without his knowledge by North who was quite happy for him to take the credit for the release of hostages when, in fact, they were the result of illegal arms sales. As a consequence, Waite would eventually be taken hostage himself. Throughout all of this, George Bush was telling the American people: \"We will make no concessions to terrorists\" - just as his son is saying today. Even before Reagan was elected, Bush negotiated with the Iranians to delay the release of American hostages until after the Presidential election of 1980 to ensure that the sitting tenant, Jimmy Carter, would not get the kudos before polling day. So well was this negotiated that 52 hostages flew out of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The Bush family crime \t 41 Iran on the day that Reagan was inaugurated after 444 days in captivity. This became known as October Surprise and no doubt the promise of arms sales to Iran by a future Reagan-Bush administration was fundamental to the deal. I know its hard for us to imagine anyone coldly ensuring that American hostages would spend months longer in captivity just to serve Bush's political agenda, but that's the mentality we are dealing with here - the same mentality that is behind September 11th and its aftermath. In late 1986, the Iran-Contra scandal blew and Ronald Reagan had to admit some, but only some, of what was happening. He said: \"A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true but the facts and evidence tell me it is not.\"(I lied.) On October 5th a plane left the Ilopango Air Base in El Salvador with arms and ammunition for the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua. The flight had been coordinated by officials within George Bush's office. As the plane came low to make the drop, it was grounded by a Sandinista missile. Three people died in the crash, but cargo handler Eugene Hasenfus parachuted into the hands of the Sandinistas. Bush was alerted in a call to his office by drug-runner and assassin Felix Rodriguez. The truth was out. Or some of it was. The power of the Illuminati network can be the only explanation for how, despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Bush evaded prosecution even though Buz Sawyer, the pilot of the crashed plane, was found to have the private phone number of George Bush's office in his pocket! Hasenfus also stated that George Bush knew about the whole thing. But Bush denied any involvement or knowledge of what happened, and subordinates like Donald Regan, Admiral John Poindexter, Oliver North, Robert McFarlane, and Major General Richard Secord, were sacrificed and scapegoated. They were very much involved, of that there is no doubt, but Bush got away with it, as did Reagan and his Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger. North, who was up to his eyes in the intrigue, faced hearings with other scapegoats and staggeringly emerged in the eyes of many as an American hero. On March 16th 1988 a Federal Grand Jury indicted North, Poindexter and others on charges that included conspiracy to defraud the US government. A year later, despite delays due to legal manoeuvring, North was convicted of three of the twelve criminal counts that came to court. He was fined $150,000 and was given a three-year suspended prison sentence. Poindexter, the Reagan-Bush National Security Adviser, was convicted on five counts of deceiving Congress and was jailed for six months. But both convictions would be set aside because it was claimed their testimony to Congress, for which they were given i mmunity, was unfairly used against them. Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor as National Security Adviser, admitted criminal charges of withholding information from Congress about the covert support for the Contras. He was fined $20,000 and given two years' probation. Others involved, like CIA Director William Casey, had \"health problems\". In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra revelations, Casey literally could not speak following an operation for a \"brain tumour\" that took away his ability to talk. Two months later he was dead. During his presidential election campaign, Bush pledged to build a \"kinder, gentler, America\". In July 1991 1"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"42 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Alan D. Fiers Jr, the head of CIA covert operations in Central America between 1984 and 1986, admitted lying to Congress about the CIA's involvement in the scandal. The Tower Commission was appointed to investigate Iran-Contra and was chaired by Bush's friend, the Texas Senator John Tower. Also on the Commission were Brent Scowcroft, a Kissinger \"yes man\" and an executive of the Illuminati front, Kissinger Associates, and Ed Muskie, Ronald Reagan's Attorney General and a close friend since his days as Governor of California. Muskie was himself implicated in Iran- Contra. As you can see, the Commission was thoroughly independent and, predictably, cleared Father George Bush of all blame and involvement. When Bush became President he made John Tower his Secretary of Defense. Reporters asked Tower if his appointment was a pay-off from Bush. His response: \"As the Commission was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie in addition to myself, that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie ... We found nothing to implicate the Vice President ... I wonder what kind of pay-off they're going to get?\" 21 I can tell him. Bush appointed Brent Scowcroft as his National Security Adviser. The Senate refused to accept Tower's appointment and he began to speak of the injustice he believed had been done to him. He died in a plane crash on April 5th 1991. When the Senate turned down Tower, a decision Bush probably engineered, he selected Dick Cheney as Defense Secretary. Cheney was the senior Republican member of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran and that also cleared Bush of involvement in Iran-Contra. Bush still had a problem, however, with the former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, who was indicted in 1992, with others, for lying to Congress over Iran-Contra. With his presidency coming to an end, this could have been disastrous for Bush and he pardoned Weinberger and the others to ensure there would be no trial. The pardon came on Christmas Eve 1992 in the dying days of his presidency after he had lost the November election to Bill Clinton and a matter of weeks before Weinberger and company were due to face a trial that would have implicated Bush. In January 1993 the presidency passed to Clinton who continued the cover-up because - as I expose in And The Truth Shall Set You Free - he was also involved, not least with the Contra drug operations at the Mena airstrip in Arkansas where he was Governor. It is actually possible to coordinate a drug-running and arms-running operation from the White House and get away with it. Where were the media while all this was going on? Licking arse as usual. One reporter, Gary Webb on the San Jose Mercury News, did have the guts to expose how the CIA and the Bush-controlled White House had poured crack cocaine into black areas to raise money for the Contras and destroy the black communities. When he did so, Webb and his newspaper were not only attacked by the authorities, but by their fellow \"journalists\" and major papers like the Washington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times. How do these people sleep at night? Rather well, I would wager.

The US response? In effect: \"Piss off.\" As with all playground bullies, United States governments, like those in Britain, claim immunity from that which they impose upon others. The Gulf War Here is another example of the mentality behind the \"war on terrorism\" that has followed the atrocities of September 11th 2001. Today we have the Bush family in the White House, Dick Cheney as Vice President and Colin Powell as Secretary of State, and a United States international \"coalition\" goes to war in the Middle-Near East. In 1991 the Bush family was in the White House, Cheney was Defense Secretary and Powell was head of the US forces as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a United States international \"coalition\" went to war in the Middle East. The Gulf War, if you add together the casualties from the initial conflict in 1991 and the sanctions and bombing that have followed, has cost the lives of more than a million Iraqi children - and rising. Already the child and civilian casualties from the \"war on terrorism\" are mounting as more mass murder ensues from the same source. Disputes between Iraq and Kuwait are not new. Kuwait has been under British and Illuminati control back to the days when the economic potential of oil was discovered. Iraq has one of the world's largest oil deposits and attracts the constant attention of the US and British elite. In fact, countries like Kuwait, Iraq and others in the Middle East, were created by the British and their fellow European powers drawing lines in the sand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, an unpleasant one, and the idea that the Gulf War was to \"free\" Kuwait is just ridiculous. If Kuwait is to be free, the dictators of the royal family elite need to give up their power and the British and US manipulation of that country and its people must end. Neither is in prospect because the way things are suits the Illuminati agenda. Kuwait is a brutal dictatorship, as is (even more so) Saudi Arabia, another country Father George Bush claimed to be protecting from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein in 1991. But after the Gulf conflict what happened? Saddam was left in power in Iraq and the Kuwaiti royal dictatorship was brought back with American and British support to continue their policy of the murder and torture of \"dissidents\" who campaign for little luxuries like freedom and a say in the running of their own country. Saddam Hussein, the designated villain of the Gulf conflict, was in fact one of the gang, at least up to this point. He was a member of the elite Safari Club, which began as a consortium involving Saddam, SAVAK (the secret police of the Shah of Iran), Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated President of Egypt, and Saudi Arabian Intelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa to further its goals and is heavily involved in arms trading and supply. Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French Prime Minister Antoine Pinay. He was a major Illuminati asset who attended the first official meeting of the elite Bilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Others involved with Le Cercle included the Habsburg family, a major Illuminati bloodline. To give you an i dea of its make-up and range of influence, the Le Cercle membership has included"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Nicholas Elliot, a department head at Britain's M16; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta of Swiss Military Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of the Italian Secret Service; Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger's friend, the former Italian Prime Minister from the notorious and terrorist P2 Freemasonry lodge, and the man who gave Mafia officials protection; Silva Munoz, a former minister for the fascist Franco in Spain and a member of the elite secret society within the Roman Catholic network, Opus Dei; Franz Josef Strauss, the German Defence Minister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent to the Vatican. In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation in Washington. Look at the potential for such an organisation to be a coordinating force between apparently different agencies and countries to achieve a common aim. Le Cercle and the Safari Club are basically the same entity, which is why, as the Wall Street Journal reported on August 16th 1990, it was the CIA that supported the Baath Party in Iraq and installed Saddam Hussein as dictator in 1968, just as they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. But it is important to remember that everyone is expendable to the cause if it best serves the agenda. Saddam Hussein was encouraged by the Americans and the British to go to war with the CIA/British Intelligence-imposed regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in 1980. The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering and loss of life. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (all controlled by the Illuminati), and for divide and rule. The British government armed both sides in this conflict and some (but only some) of this scandal surfaced through the Scott Inquiry into illegal arms sales to Iraq that reported in 1996. The Iran-Iraq War is a grotesque example of problem-reaction-solution. The CIA looked after Khomeini during his exile in Paris to ensure he was ready and waiting to take over when the Shah, another CIA puppet, had outlived his usefulness. Now Saddam would be used again, knowingly or otherwise, to start another war in the Gulf by invading Kuwait. Author and researcher George C. Andrews reported: \"A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our Declaration of War on December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker, signed the US Army Report from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested]. This report describes in detail how extensively Kuwait will be destroyed, how the oil wells will be set on fire, and then how it will all be rebuilt ' better than before', with despotism, instead of democracy, even more entrenched than i t had been before. The report includes a list of US corporations who will be assigned the profitable task of rebuilding Kuwait and extinguishing the oil fires, as well as the Arab names they will be operating under. [Exactly the same was done before the \"war\" i n Afghanistan]. \" Why have none of his political opponents thought of asking the obvious questions: How did George Bush's so-called 'blind trust' make out during the time frame of the Gulf War? Why are the huge business deals between Bush and Hussein still off-limits to the public's right to know?\" 22"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The Bush family crime \t 45 To readers of my books, the answers to these questions will be obvious. The ' blind trust', by the way, is the farce that insists that presidents must hand over all their business dealings to a \"trust\" during their term in office. This is supposed to ensure they can't make political decisions that affect their own investments and companies. Yeah, sounds credible. Bush's 'blind trust' was controlled by his close friend William S. Farish III, the grandson of William Farish, the President of Standard Oil New Jersey when they were working with Hitler's chemical and drug cartel I.G. Farben, which ran the slave camp at Auschwitz. While William Farish was head of Standard Oil, it was supplying the Nazis through Switzerland during the war, as established by official inquiries. Today his grandson and Bush \"trust manager\", William S. Farish III, is the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom as Boy George Bush conducts his \"war on terrorism\" in conjunction with Tony Blair's British government. William Farish III is also a very close associate of Queen Elizabeth II and she keeps some of her breeding mares at his Lane's End Farm, near Versailles in Kentucky, where she has been a regular visitor.\" (The detailed background to the involvement of the British royal family with the Illuminati can be found in The Biggest Secret.) Anyway, back to the Gulf War, or Gulf Slaughter as it really was. American reconnaissance advised George Bush around July 16th and 17th 1990 that Iraqi troops were assembling along the border with Kuwait (or so the official story goes). Nothing was done. On July 25th Saddam Hussein met with the US ambassador in Baghdad, April Glaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions of President Bush. She said the Bush government had \"no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflict like your border disagreement with Kuwait\". Glaspie added that she had instructions from the President to seek better relations with Iraq. She then left for a summer holiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans were not interested in the whole thing. 24 While all of this was going on, Bush still had nothing to say in public about the troop build-ups along the Kuwaiti border. By July 31st perhaps 100,000 troops were involved. Still Bush was silent. Two days before the invasion, John Kelly, an assistant Secretary of State, was asked by a congressional hearing if the US would defend Kuwait in the event of an attack. He replied: \"We have no defence treaty with any Gulf country.\" 25 On August 2nd Saddam invaded Kuwait. Henry Kissinger was operating behind the scenes in the form of Brent Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser, a long-time Kissinger aide back to the days of the Nixon Presidency and an executive of Kissinger Associates. Scowcroft was urging military intervention and the Bush tone began to change. The United States told the Saudi Arabians that Saddam was likely to invade their country next - utter claptrap - and Bush ordered US troops to assemble along the \"threatened\" Saudi border. There would be no intervention, the world was told. The US forces were only there to protect Saudi Arabia, Bush said, and economic sanctions were to be the weapon used against Saddam. The Saudi Arabians, Germans and Japanese were pressured into contributing large sums towards American costs. But sanctions were never going to be the real weapon and the rhetoric became ever stronger. Bush labelled Saddam \"the new Hitler\" and said that the Second"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"46 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. World War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. He might have added that it is also not the answer to fund both sides in a conflict and to help finance Hitler's war machine, as his father had done. For those who knew the game plan, it was easy to see what was happening. On August 23rd Kissinger's man, Brent Scowcroft, said it all: \"We believe we are creating the beginning of a New World Order out of the collapse of the US-Soviet antagonisms.\" 26 New World Order is a very old code name for the Illuminati global agenda. The term would be used by Bush in a speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 and enter into political speak around the world to the point of tedium. He described his New World Order as \"diverse nations drawn together in common cause\". Lose the newspeak and this translates as world government, central bank, army and currency controlled by a Big Brother dictatorship - the very structure that 9 / 11 brought so much closer. Bush received enthusiastic support for his war against Iraq from Illuminati puppets Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterand, the 33rd degree Freemason and President of France, who had supported the Nazis during their occupation of his country. Both sent forces to the Gulf alongside the Americans and the Illuminati \"coalition\" was presented as a United Nations response. Bush said in that speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 - exactly 11 years to the day before 9/11: \"Clearly no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun, and we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective - a new world order - can emerge ...\" 27 For \"fifth\" read \"first\" and, of course, this is a mirror of the rhetoric we have had to endure since the attacks on the World Trade Center. Father Bush announced on November 8th 1990 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would be substantially increased. The \"defensive\" force was now to switch to offensive mode. A week later Bush left on a tour of Europe and the Middle East gathering support for the invasion. He met for three hours with the late President Assad of Syria, another tool of the Illuminati, who pledged to increase his contribution to Bush's forces to 20,000 men. The Bush \"UN\" forces attacked on Wednesday, January 16th 1991. 120,000 air sorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, it turned out, against civilian areas. The operation was headed by Bush's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who has ancestral links with many old American and British families. The number of dead and injured from the bombing of Iraq, the resulting disease and the continuing economic sanctions can hardly be comprehended. Conditions for the innocent civilians in Iraq are unimaginable under the economic stranglehold that has been imposed since the Gulf War. This is the United Nations in all its glory. It is not the promoter of freedom, peace, and justice, as its PR proclaims, it is an Illuminati stalking horse for global government. By the way, part of the propaganda"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 47 to gain political and public support for the invasion of Iraq was the \"evidence\" given to the Senate by a teenage girl that Iraqi soldiers had thrown Kuwaiti babies from their incubators and sent the incubators to Baghdad. Later it emerged that the teenager was in fact the daughter of the Kuwait Ambassador to Washington and the whole story was a lie cooked up by public relations firm Hill and Knowlton. 2 \" How Bush funded Saddam The public were also not told that it was the Bush government that had armed and funded the very army of Saddam Hussein that Father George had now sent US troops to fight. Much of the funding was channelled through a branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Congressman Henry Gonzales exposed the BNL scandal in 1991 after he noticed that this little branch of the Italian government bank had loaned Iraq $5 billion. This money was dispatched to Saddam after November 1989 when the Bush White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraq if they were to be used for the purchase for US farm products. If Saddam defaulted, the US taxpayers picked up the tab for the loan and, since he was always defaulting, that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. As planned, Saddam spent the money on arms, including purchases from the Matrix Churchill machine tool company in England. This company was the subject of a court case in which the British government was implicated. Although many US investigators warned Bush that the money was being used for arms, the loans were allowed to continue. The aim was obvious when you look at the other evidence. Bush was doing the same as his father did with Hitler. He was funding an aggressor so he could start a war with him. Some of the money given to Saddam by Bush was spent on buying poison gas from a CIA front called Cardeon Industries in Chile.\" When the war started, Saddam defaulted on the loans and the US taxpayers footed the bill for Iraq to fight their own sons and daughters. The cover-up of this, as usual, led to the targeting of the small fry. The whole thing was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL's Atlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogoul, who could never have sanctioned that sort of money without the highest authorisation. One of the network of Illuminati private \"armies\" is called the Wackenhut Corporation and investigative journalist John Connolly exposed in a Spy Magazine article\" that Wackenhut had been involved in the arming of Iraq before the Gulf War by transporting the means to produce the very chemical weapons that Father George Bush and Co were saying posed such a threat to the world. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company with other FBI associates in 1954 and its board has been packed over the years with recruits from the FBI, CIA and the military. It has since merged with Group 4 Falck, the world's second largest provider of Security Services. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of Father George Bush and has contributed generously to his political campaigns and those of Boy George and Florida governor Jeb Bush. John Connolly wrote that: \"... After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more than 300 people, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] truck did contain equipment"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"48 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. necessary for the manufacture of chemical weapons and where it was headed [in the Winter of 1990]: to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And the Wackenhut Corporation - a publicly traded company with strong ties to the CIA and federal contracts worth $200 million a year - was making sure Saddam would be getting his equipment intact.\" 31 A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he was involved at one time with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton and with Ishan Barbouti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, the chemical and biological weapons complex in Rabta, Libya . 32 His experiences led him to investigate what was going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI, and operated for the US government under a code name because they told him these people were international terrorists and that they were going to prosecute them. Kawaja said that he did his own investigation, however, which included \"bugging telephone lines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the United States\". He said he intercepted communications to the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said he saw the letters of credit of the BNL, which came from Switzerland, and \"a lot of other communications regarding the Gulf War that was to come.\" He said he recorded calls going to and coming from Baghdad, to and from the United States and London, CIA, FBI, FBI counter- intelligence, US Customs, certain politicians, and numerous other individuals. \"This is my information,\" he said in the radio interview. \"It is not second-hand.\" US District Judge Marvin Shoob said the claim that the Atlanta branch of the BNL could loan $5 billion to Iraq without the approval of the head office in Rome could only come out of \"never-never land\". The judge said that manager Drogoul and four other employees at the branch: .. were pawns or bit players in a far larger and wider ranging sophisticated conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American and foreign corporations and the governments of the United States, England, Italy and Iraq ... smoke is coming out of every window. I have to conclude that the building is on fire.\" 33 This is the last thing the Father Bush administration and the Illuminati wanted to hear. Judge Shoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge Ernest Tidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA and the Bush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded to plead guilty even though he wasn't. The funding of the Iraqi arms build-up before the Gulf War involved the Bush administration, the British government, the Italian government, the Soviet Union and other leading governments controlled by the Illuminati. It also involved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger. As early as 1984 his company Kissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL to Iraq to finance its arms purchases from a little-known subsidiary of Fiat, which was headed by major Illuminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, a former justice Department investigator, was quoted about this in the US Spotlight newspaper on November 9th 1992. The report said:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 49 \"Barletta added that Federal probers had collected dozens of such incriminating case histories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger seems to possess a kind of i mmunity. I'm not sure how he does it, but Kissinger wields as much power over the Washington National Security bureaucracy now as in the days when he was the Nixon administration's foreign policy czar. He gets the pay-off; others get the blame. Kissinger will remain unscathed until Congress finds the courage to convene a full-dress i nvestigation into this Teflon power broker.\" Home of the brave .. It is appropriate to focus on the Gulf War before we proceed to 9/11 and the \"war on terrorism\", for these are mirrors of each other. Same people, same agenda, same methods, same mass slaughter of the innocent. Firstly, as with Afghanistan, the Gulf War wasn't exactly a war. My understanding of a \"war\" is that you need two sides, and under that definition, the Gulf War was not a \"war\". It was the military equivalent of putting Mike Tyson in the ring with your granny. American soldiers have described this \"war\" as a \"turkey shoot\", which is precisely what it was. The Iraqi army, mainly conscripts who had no choice, may have been armed by the US and Britain, but it was still like trying to stop an elephant with a pop gun. Iraqi men, women and children were subjected to the most intense bombing blitz in human history. Hundreds of thousands died in the bombardment and while the media were showing us pictures provided by the US military of \"smart bombs\" that could target a building and go through a toilet window, the truth that was being suppressed daily by the military censors was very different. At least 93% of the bombs that rained from the Iraqi skies were not \"smart\" and that's according to the Pentagon's own numbers, and 70% of them missed their target. Wade Frazier's excellent study of the Gulf \"War\" reveals the background to just one of the devices used against the Iraqi people: \"The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads a fine mist of fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a football field] into an explosive mix of vast proportion; then a second detonation ignites the mixture, causing an awesome explosion. The explosion is about the most powerful 'conventional' explosion we know of. \"At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in its detonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around them. Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The bomb sucks oxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out through the mouths of people unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone. Our military used it on helpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].\" 34 These were the same weapons used in Afghanistan. The Iraqi people, living, breathing, human beings like you and me, were also subjected to a lovely piece of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"50 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. hardware called a \"Big Blue\", which produces a shock wave only eclipsed by nuclear weapons. As Wade Frazier points out, the power of the shock wave can turn a body into a hamburger. So-called \"bouncing bombs\" were also deployed. These are designed to \"bounce\" to waist height before exploding and ensure a better chance of splattering people into a thousand pieces. These are called \"anti- personnel\" weapons in the sanitised \"newspeak\" of the Illuminati front men. Then there was (and is) the \"Beehive\", which explodes 8,800 pieces of razor-edged shrapnel in all directions, cutting through a human body like the proverbial knife through butter. All these weapons were used against civilian men, women and children in the Gulf \"War\" and all the others since, including the \"war on terrorism\". In an oh so rare excursion into reality by the media, John Balzar of the Los Angeles Times reported in 1991 on the fate of Iraqi conscripts. He saw night- vision \"gun sight\" footage from the briefing room: \"They looked like ghostly sheep flushed from a pen - Iraqi infantrymen bewildered and terrified, jarred from sleep and fleeing their bunkers under a hellish fire. One by one, they were cut down by attackers they could not see or understand. Some were blown to bits by bursts of 30-millimeter exploding cannon shells. One man dropped, writhed on the ground, then struggled to his feet; another burst of fire tore him apart ... Even hardened soldiers hold their breath as the Iraqi soldiers, as big as football players on the television screen, run with nowhere to hide. These are not bridges exploding or airplane hangers. These are men.\" The same reporter wrote: \"The mechanics of death and destruction are a grim affair. The military's scientific approach and its philosophies - for example, its preference for wounding vital organs over blowing off limbs - can be deeply disquieting to anybody who imagines such matters are left to chance. Many people would rather not know about the gruesome details\" .35 \"Nuke 'em, kill 'em all\" This was not a war, it was a mass slaughter by the very forces and controllers who are now waging a \"war on terrorism\" against anyone they choose to demonise through their pathetic media. These protectors of \"freedom\" and \"liberty\" used the same rhetoric then as they do now to justify the mass bombing of civilians. They hide this truth because of the lies so eagerly repeated by journalists who insult our intelligence and a public that has long forgotten, not only what to think, but even how to. Then, as now, no dissent was allowed against the genocide of the innocent by the criminally insane. Talk show hosts, without two brain cells acting in unison, called for nuclear attacks on Iraq and anyone who challenged the \"war\" was either stupid or a supporter of evil. While the sheeple followed the fox, or Fox, the US government and their British allies were targeting civilian bomb shelters, killing"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 51 hundreds of fathers, mothers and children because \"Intelligence told us that the bomb shelter was actually a military headquarters\". Bullshit. These are the same idiots (or coldly calculated killers more like) who bombed a town in Afghanistan a week after the Taliban had left! What people need to realise is that US surveillance satellites can read your car number plate from space; and look at how the Airman magazine described the capabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane deployed in Afghanistan: \"On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear that an electro- optical image stands out next to an F/A-18 fighter. An infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a C-130 that had recently taken off.\" 36 So there are no \"mistakes\" about who or what is located in a bomb shelter. It is cold-blooded murder. For the same reason there are no \"mistakes\" in the failure, at least officially, to establish the location of Osama bin Laden during the invasion of Afghanistan. Reporter Peter Arnett of CNN visited the civilian bomb shelter in Iraq and found it was ... a bomb shelter. He also visited a milk factory bombed because it was a \"chemical weapons factory\" and found it was ... a milk factory. In fact he had been there a year before and it was producing ... milk. The Highway of Death On the ground thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive as \"UN\" forces used bulldozers to fill in their trenches in fundamental contravention of international law. But nothing sums up the mentality of these deeply sick people currently waging the \"war on terrorism\" better than the almost unimaginable attacks on the \"Highway of Death\". The Iraqi army was in retreat in the wake of the air bombardment and headed out of Kuwait across the border to Basra. With them were civilians and prisoners. US pilots attacked the vehicles at the front and back of the seven-mile retreating human convoy, so forcing it to a standstill on the open road. They then systematically bombed the convoy, constantly racing back to their aircraft carrier to re-arm and return to continue the mass murder. As one pilot said, it was like \"shooting fish in a barrel\" and thousands died at the hands of the very people who now \"fight terrorism\" and promote themselves as morally superior to those they target. Barry McCaffrey, one of the generals involved in this mass murder, was later appointed by President Clinton to head his \"war on drugs\". Yet, as he conducted these crimes against humanity, Father George Bush's approval ratings soared, just as they did for his son when he continued the long, long, family association with human genocide. The blatant defiance of the Geneva Convention on the Highway of Death produced no action against the Bush administration because there is one law for America, Britain, France and Germany, etc., and a very different one for those they choose to bomb, kill, and mutilate. An International War Crimes Tribunal found President George Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker, and military leaders Colin"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"52 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, guilty of war crimes. But what was done as a result? Nothing. These are the people who have the audacity to put others on trial for war crimes, like the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Dark knights The Illuminati Queen of England was most grateful to these genocidal maniacs, however, and she made Bush's military chiefs Colin Powell and \"Stormin\"' Norman Schwarzkopf, (the commander of Operation Desert Storm) Honorary Knights of the British Empire. Schwarzkopf has lied through his teeth about the \"mystery\" disease known as Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted veterans of that slaughter. His father would have been proud of him. Norman Schwarzkopf senior had been an i mportant player in the British-American Intelligence coup called Operation AJAX, which removed the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. The Illuminati wanted him ousted after he nationalised oil production and removed the oil cartel's power over his people. The British bloodline Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also behind the coup and Mossadegh was replaced by the dictatorship of the Shah of Iran who reversed the oil nationalisation (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). It is rare for the Queen to give Honorary Knighthoods and other honours to people outside the Commonwealth, but those she has chosen read like an Illuminati Who's Who. The titles are dubbed \"honorary\" because the American Constitution forbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch of a foreign state without the permission of Congress. So few of these honours are given because, as a British government official put it: \"One must not debase the currency.\" I wonder if you think the following names debase the currency: George Bush, the paedophile, child killer, mass murderer, Satanist and close friend of the Windsors, was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as was Ronald Reagan, Bush's lapdog \"President\"; Henry Kissinger, the orchestrator of genocide on a monumental scale worldwide, was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George at a ceremony at Windsor Castle; Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and top adviser to George Bush, was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire; and Casper Weinberger, another Bush clone who was charged with offences in the Iran-Contra arms scandal and pardoned by Bush, is another Honorary Knight of the British Empire. After the September 11th atrocities, the insider mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for doing nothing more than the job he was paid handsomely to do. So why was he such a chosen one? For some more realistic background to \"hero\" Giuliani and his activities see the website of Robert Lederman, a street artist in New York and a regular columnist for the Greenwich Village Gazette.\" Burying the truth The crimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates are responsible rarely come to light because the media, at the top level, is controlled by the Illuminati and most journalists either don't realise they are pawns in a game or"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 53 they accept it to protect their careers. The accounts are legion of how evidence and footage that expose the lies, especially in wartime, are banned or confiscated. One example during the 1991 Gulf Slaughter was when the American TV networks NBC and CBS refused to air pictures shot in Iraq of the destruction of civilian areas that revealed the Bush government and military accounts to be a grotesque fiction - just as they are in the \"war on terrorism\". The story was blocked by the President of NBC Michael Gartner and the producers offered it to CBS, where Tom Bettag, the Executive Editor of the CBS Evening News, said one of them would appear on the show the following day to tell their story That evening Bettag was sacked and the story buried. This is the real background to the TV news.\" Footage of the Highway of Death was also suppressed and, as in the \"war on terrorism\", US casualties caused by the enemy were claimed to be \"training accidents\". Bush's lies about Iraqi troop deployments in Kuwait, provable by satellite images, were also never shown. This satellite \"loophole in the lies\" was the reason why the US government purchased all rights to satellite pictures of Afghanistan while that country was subjected to another insane American and British bombing onslaught. We should note, of course, that having said that the CIA-installed dictator Saddam Hussein was a threat to the world, and with the Iraqi \"army\" destroyed, Father George Bush suddenly called an end to the \"war\" and pulled the troops out leaving Saddam still intact. As Norman Schwarzkopf said with an air of disappointment: \"We could have completely closed the door and made it a battle of annihilation ... [it was] literally about to become the battle of Cannae, a battle of annihilation.\" Ah, never mind Norman, but you see your President and those who controlled him wanted Hussein to stay put, or at least appear to, so they could play that card over and over. I suspect, however, that the Saddam story is going to lead to some kind of climax eventually. Look at this America ... The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1991, but in fact it was only beginning. Using the \"threat\" of Saddam, the \"threat\" Bush chose not to remove when it was there for the taking, the United States and the UK, the diabolical duo of world terrorism, have led a campaign of \"sanctions\" against Iraq. They have also continued, unreported, the bombing of civilian targets, a policy maintained by the Clinton and Boy George Bush administrations. Investigative journalist John Pilger wrote of a woman he met in northern Iraq who had lost her husband, children and father-in-law when they were bombed by two US planes while tending their sheep on open land.\" The sanctions against a country that imports 70% of its food have been imposed on a people already devastated by the mass bombing of their electricity, water supply, transport and sewer systems, which the British and American governments have refused to allow them to rebuild. A public health team from Harvard University went into Iraq soon after the official bombing and estimated that over 46,000 children under the age of five had already died by August 1991 because of the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.\" But the nightmare was only beginning. Writer Thomas J. Nagy exposed the coldly calculated way the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"54 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. US military targeted the Iraqi water supply in the full knowledge of the gruesome affect this would have on the people, especially children. In an article headed \"The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq's Water Supply\", he wrote that \"the United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis, mostly children, would pay, and it went ahead anyway.\" \" Nagy, who lectures at the School of Business and Public Management at George Washington University, uncovered documents from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunning disregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 1991 says: \"Iraq depends on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify its water supply ... Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of pure drinking water for much of the population. This could lead to increased incidences, if not epidemics, of disease.\" They add that the \"most likely diseases during [the] next 60-90 days [include]: diarrhoea) diseases (particularly children); acute respiratory illnesses (colds and influenza); typhoid; hepatitis A (particularly children); measles, diphtheria, and pertussis (particularly children); meningitis, including meningococcal (particularly children); cholera (possible, but less likely).\" 42 This is a fundamental violation of the Geneva Convention which says: \"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive.\" The US/British-led sanctions against Iraq do all of these things. By 1995 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the US Sixty Minutes television programme that these sanctions had already cost the lives of half a million Iraqi children and that was only up to then. The figure is currently running at some 5,000 dead children a month and passing a million in total, while the perpetrators lead a \"war on terrorism\"! Albright said on Sixty Minutes that she thought the consequences for those children were worth it to stop Saddam. This is the mentality that controls our world. A report by Richard Garfield of Columbia University concluded that the increase in child death rates in Iraq was virtually unique in modern health studies.\" Conditions like kwashiorkor and marasmus, the result of starvation, are now common. We are told of the horrific treatment of women by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but not of the same treatment by Saudi Arabia, a brutal, fascist regime, which is on the side of the \"good guys\" in the \"war against sanity\"; and we are told nothing about the plight of women in Iraq in the face of the US and British-led sanctions. Some 70% of Iraqi women are now anaemic. Denis Halliday, the coordinator of the so-called \"oil-for-food\" programme, resigned in September 1998 and spoke out against the genocidal affects of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 55 sanctions. His successor, Hans von Sponeck, did the same in February 2000. The US government response was to try to discredit the two men. The \"oil for food\" farce provides the oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil; 40% of Iraqi's oil, exchanged to buy food, ends up in the United States at knock-down prices because of the sanctions i mposed by the United States and supported by the Illuminati front, the United Nations. The sanctions are \"justified\" in part because of the \"weapons of mass destruction\", including biological weapons, claimed to be stockpiled by Saddam Hussein. Well, first, the Iraqi arsenal, whatever it may be, was funded by the US and British governments and their allies. Second, the biggest owner of weapons of mass destruction on the planet is the American government and by far the greatest user of them is ... the US government. Only one government has dropped nuclear weapons on another country at the time of writing ... the US government. British leaders, too, have an appalling record of genocide and as far back as 1919, when Winston Churchill was Secretary of State at the War Office, they were using chemical weapons against Iraq. Churchill said this about the use of poison gas to put down an Iraqi rebellion against colonial rule: \"I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. I am strongly in favour of using [it] against uncivilised tribes.\" ' When Saddam Hussein offered in 1990 to destroy such weapons in Iraq if Israel did the same with theirs, the United States government said it was not willing to negotiate on that subject - not least because to acknowledge that Israel has a massive nuclear capability would make illegal the billions of dollars of US aid to that country every year.\" They all know of Israel's nuclear stockpile, but if no one officially admits it exists they can go on with business as usual. As the former United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: \"It would be some time before I fully realised that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy ... The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.\" 46 It appears to see no need to tell the truth, either. In early 1999, it was revealed that the Iraqis' claims about United Nations weapon inspections in their country was correct. The UNSCOM inspections were being used for spying by the United States. The Washington Post of March 2nd quoted US officials who described how members of the UNSCOM team had been planting spying devices for the United States during their \"independent inspections\". Scott Ritter, one of the weapons inspectors in Iraq, made it clear that the United States and British governments were lying about the dangers posed by Iraq - the very \"dangers\" they have used to justify their onslaught against Iraqi civilians, especially children. Ritter said in the June 2000 edition of Arms Control Today: \"Given the comprehensive nature of the monitoring regime put in place by UNSCOM, which included a strict export-import control regime, it was possible as early as 1997 to determine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed. Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities of chemical or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrial means to produce these agents had either been eliminated"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"56 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. or were subject to stringent monitoring. The same was true of Iraq's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. ' ... By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a level unprecedented in modern history, but UNSCOM and the Security Council were unable - and in some i nstances unwilling -to acknowledge this accomplishment.\" Why? Because it would have destroyed the cover story necessary to continue the genocide. Add to that the voting record of the United States at the United Nations where it has consistently opposed resolutions to limit the production and testing of biological and nuclear weapons, as it has on a stream of humanitarian and freedom issues. Robert Cooper, a former diplomat and personal assistant for foreign affairs to British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted in The Post-Modern State and the World Order: \"We need to get used to the idea of double standards ... [in other words] ... get over it, we are hypocrites (but powerful ones).\" Cooper said that the conflict with Iraq was to maintain control of oil supplies and that \" ... The reasons for fighting the Gulf War were not that Iraq had violated the norms of international behaviour ...\". Exactly. They just use any excuse to sell a lie to the people to advance their agenda - as they have with September 11th. When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons on the Kurdish people, the United States and Britain didn't say a word because he was a US ally at the time, fighting the Iraq-Iran war in which the US and Britain were arming both sides. The forces of freedom and liberty have also been bombing Iraq with radioactive weapons and this has led to the birth of babies with horrible deformities and disease (see my website). Since this bombardment began, Iraq has developed the world's highest rate of childhood leukaemia. At the same time there has been an embargo on medicines and technology that would help to reduce the radiation. The genocidal attacks on the Iraqi population began with \"Republican\" George Bush, continued with \"Democrat\" Bill Clinton, and within a month of taking office at the start of 2001, George W. Bush, another \"Republican\", was ordering (being told to order) more \"routine\" bombing of Iraq. In truth they are just lackeys for the same one-party state and that's why the policies never change no matter who is in the White House. The bank of crooks and criminals (BCCI) The funding and manipulation of the Gulf War connects with another scandal, that of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. This had close links with the Italian BNL, the bank used by the United States to bankroll Saddam Hussein. A brief summary of the BCCI debacle is necessary because of the people involved and the connections from the BCCI through to current events. The BCCI was formed in the early 1970s and expanded rapidly to boast 400 branches in 78 countries. Its name is remarkably similar to the Banque De Credit International (BCI) of the Mossad agent Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, which was used by the British-American Intelligence network involved in the assassination of President Kennedy (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Its \"successor\", the BCCI, was a major player in the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 57 drug money-laundering network and was used for this purpose by Illuminati elements within the CIA, British Intelligence and Mossad. Money to fund covert operations, terrorists groups like those of Osama bin Laden and Abu Nidal, coups and assassinations throughout the world, and the financing of Iran-Contra and Saddam Hussein, was also channelled through the BCCI. Former US Green Beret Albert Carone claimed he was a representative of the BCCI while working on covert operations. He said the bank was founded by the US intelligence community to finance covert operations worldwide without the approval of Congress.\" In other words, to finance the Illuminati agenda. Money could be transferred between apparent enemies through this network, as with Saudi Arabian money, which found its way to Mossad. In this case, Saudi and other Gulf money was laundered through the BCCI and transferred to CenTrust in Miami, which was later seized by Federal investigators. The BCCI owned 28% of CenTrust. Allegations emerged that Robert Gates, the man Bush nominated as his Director of the CIA, had obstructed an investigation into drug money laundering by the BCCI. Gates withdrew his nomination to be CIA Director, as he had once before when implicated in Iran- Contra. The BCCI crashed amid a worldwide scandal in 1991. It was the world's biggest banking collapse and cost investors billions of dollars. Three years before the crash, Robert Gates was describing the BCCI as the Bank of Crooks and Criminals. The BCCI began to operate in Pakistan in 1972 with most of its funding provided by the Bank of America and the CIA. Bank of America also loaned money to people to buy stock in BCCI, probably to hide the scale of its control, and the B of A knew all about money laundering. In 1986, it was fined $7 million for 17,000 acts of washing dirty money. Some researchers say that the Rothschilds control the Bank of America. At the hub of the Rothschild involvement in the BCCI was Doctor Alfred Hartmann who, at the same time, was the managing director of the Swiss branch of the BCCI; the head of the Zurich Rothschild bank, AG; a board member of N.M. Rothschild in London; and a director of ... Italy's BNL, the bank through which the Bush government covertly funded Saddam Hussein. The involvement of the Rothschilds at the heart of the BCCI was never mentioned or investigated by the media, nor was the alleged involvement of the financier and currency speculator, George Soros, of the Illuminati Bilderberg Group. Here a Bush, there a Bush, everywhere a Bush, Bush Father George Bush and his successor Bill Clinton both had considerable connections with the BCCI. Among them was Jackson Stephens. He is the owner of Stephens Incorporated, a big investment bank based in Little Rock, Arkansas, the home of Bill Clinton. Stephens was one of the founders of the BCCI. He had connections with a company called Harken Energy and arranged a loan for them from a Swiss bank affiliated with the BCCI. This would have greatly pleased George W. Bush, the then President's son, who sat on the Harken board and had a fortune invested in the company Another investor in Harken Energy, it emerged after September 11th, was Khalid bin Mahfouz, the operations director of the BCCI and 20% shareholder who was later named by the United States government as a"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. financial supporter of Osama bin Laden. What a coincidence. Jeb Bush, Boy George's brother and now Governor of Florida, also had numerous dealings with the BCCI. He was often seen in the bank's Miami office and Father George's deputy campaign manager, James Lake, worked for a major owner of the BCCI at the time. When Bill Clinton, Father Bush's \"opponent\", ran for president, his main financial backer was the same Jackson Stephens who made the donations via his Worthen National Bank, which was connected to the BCCI. Stephens was implicated in deals in which the BCCI secretly and illegally took over the First American Bank of Washington and others. This was the man who funded the Bushes and the Clintons. Father George's involvement with the BCCI was considerable, according to the Chicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. He has claimed publicly, including an interview on Radio Free America, that Bush, Saddam Hussein, and others, used the BCCI to split $250 billion in oil \"kick backs\", the skimming-off of money paid by western oil companies in the Gulf. Other researchers and insiders have said the same. Skolnick claims that the records i mplicating Bush in deals with Saddam and former Panama President Manuel Noriega were in the hands of the Bank of England and that the money was channelled through the BCCI and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) branches in the USA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, identified links between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer Tom Valentine on Radio Free America: \"[The BCCI] ... was formed in the 1970s with seed money from the Bank of America, the largest shareholders of which are the Rothschilds of Chicago, Paris, London, and Switzerland ... The bank is also linked to the financial affairs of former President Jimmy Carter and his friend, and one-time budget director, banker Bert Lance. \"Some of the ... Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have been published, for example, in the May 3rd issue of the Wall Street Journal. During the 1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major financiers of the Michael Dukakis campaign ... BCCI financed the Democratic Party in the United States and arranged deals for Republicans outside the United States.\" 48 Ji mmy Carter personally dedicated a number of BCCI branches and they made an $8.5 million donation to one of his favourite charities. Carter's foreign travel after he left the White House was paid for by the BCCI and his banker friend Bert Lance was bailed out of big financial difficulties by Gaith Pharaon, a front man for the BCCI. Andrew Young, Carter's former United Nations ambassador, and a fellow member of the Illuminati's Trilateral Commission, had a loan of $160,000 written off by the BCCI and was paid to promote the bank to individuals and governments in Africa and Central America. Orrin Hatch, the Republican Senator for Utah, was making stirring speeches in support of the BCCI even while it was being indicted for drug money laundering. This is the same Orrin Hatch who told CNN immediately after the planes struck the World Trade Center that officials believed that Osama bin"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 59 Laden could be responsible.' The Democrat Clark Clifford and his law partner Robert Altman, the BCCI's lawyers, were at the centre of the story, also. Pricewaterhouse, the BCCI's auditors for nearly 20 years, were giving the bank a largely clean bill of health while all the corruption was going on. Skolnick said records detailing the alleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in the Chicago branch of the BCCI, which was seized by the Federal government in 1988. Skolnick went on: \"The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between General Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, and George Bush. In January of 1990, the Federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida's branch on trial. They were allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the wrist and a small penalty. Here's why: they told the Justice Department that if they were going to prison, they had documents from their bank showing that George Bush had private business ventures through their bank with a series of dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well ... .. Saddam's oil was shipped to Texas. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of Pennzoil, i ssued the largest damages verdict in American history against Texaco. Pennzoil claimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil. Who owns Pennzoil? George Bush and his friends ... as a result Texaco fell under the domination and supervision of Pennzoil. Where did the kickbacks to Saddam reportedly come from? They came from deals between Texaco and its subsidiaries purchasing oil from Iraq.\" 50 You can leave your lid on ... If you placed end to end all the questions that Father George Bush needs to answer, but won't, they would stretch from Washington to Baghdad. An official investigation was ordered to investigate the BCCI scandal and was chaired by Democrat Senator, John Kerry, of Massachusetts. It exposed nothing. Senator Kerry was chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee that received large contributions from the BCCI and he is also a member of the Skull and Bones Society. The corruption across American politics, media, banking, business and the military is simply staggering, and so it is in the United Kingdom wing of the Illuminati, where the BCCI had its main base. The British Prime Minister at the time of the cover-up was John Major who is now a business associate of Father George Bush, who was US President at the time. The British \"inquiry\" report on the bank by Lord Justice Bingham decided that the collapse was due to \"a tragedy of errors, misunderstandings, and failures of communication\". For goodness sake, it was one of the biggest drug money, terrorist-funding, and illegal arms money laundering operations the world has yet seen. It implicated some of the biggest names in global politics, banking and business, and financed terrorists, drug cartels and covert operations by British Intelligence, the CIA and others of that ilk. The Bank of England completed the cover-up through an arrangement with Abu Dhabi, the bank's principal owners at the time of the collapse. This agreement allowed"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"60 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. i mportant records and witnesses to leave Britain. How convenient. In his review of Dirty Money, a book about the BCCI, the journalist Robert Sherrill said: \"Dirty Money clearly leaves the impression that many officials are less than enthusiastic about digging deeper into the scandal. Could it be because of that rumoured list of 100 politicians that the BCCI paid off? Or because 'key investigators' have indicated that if they continued their probe it might take them 'into the highest l evels of political power around the world' in ways that would dwarf even the wildest conspiracy theory. Whoa! That would never do.\" 51 The invasion of Panama Readers new to this information will no doubt be extremely surprised to see the names of Saddam Hussein and General Manuel Noriega so closely connected to Father George Bush. After all, didn't he invade both of their countries on the pretext of removing their \"terrorist\" regimes? Ah, but that's the movie version for public consumption. The real story, as always, is very different - just as it is with September 11th. The Bush attack on Panama on December 20th 1989 was about drugs, although not in the way it was portrayed by the government and the media. This is another fine example of how the truth of the situation is submerged in political rhetoric and media camouflage. We are told that American troops invaded Panama and abducted President Manuel Noriega because of his drug-running activities and to save American children from the evil of drugs. In fact, the opposite was the case. Noriega was on the payroll of the CIA while Bush was its Director and he was being paid some $110,000 a year for his \"services\", which included running drugs. When Bush was challenged about this after the invasion of Panama, he said he had never met Noriega, but then suddenly remembered the meeting. Noriega was involved in drug trafficking and rigged elections, but the Bush government and the CIA knew that when they employed him. William Tyree, a former member of the elite US Green Beret regiment, said in testimony for a law-suit against George Bush and the CIA filed in 1998 that he flew more than 100 plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to the Albrook Air Station in Panama between December 1975 and March 1976 as part of \"Operation Watchtower\". Looking on as the cocaine was unloaded, he said, were CIA officers, an Israeli colonel and Manuel Noriega. Tyree filed the suit in an effort to prove his innocence after being jailed for the murder of his wife, Elaine. She kept a diary of her husband's drug-running activities for the CIA and George Bush, and when Tyree began to speak out about his experiences his wife was murdered, the diary stolen, and he was framed for the killing in 1979. Tyree alleged in the suit that Father George Bush ordered the theft and destruction of his wife's diary. Another Green Beret, Colonel Albert Carone, described how he worked with Oliver North in drug trafficking during Iran-Contra. Carone was murdered in 1990 and five other Special Forces colonels also involved have died in mysterious circumstances. Carone's testimony was among the documents presented by Tyree in the lawsuit, which, of course, was covered up. 52"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 61 Arnulfo Arias won the 1984 Panama election, but Noriega took power with a mixture of extreme violence and fraud. The US Secretary of State George Shultz, a major Illuminati operator, was dispatched to give legitimacy to Noriega and even to declare that Panama's democratic principles were a lesson to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua! According to Noriega, his relationship with Bush began to change during the Iran-Contra period when Admiral John Poindexter, the head of the National Security Council, visited him on December 17th 1985. Poindexter was prosecuted for his part in Iran-Contra. Noriega told CBS reporter Mike Wallace that Poindexter demanded that he support the illegal US war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. When he refused, Poindexter threatened economic warfare and the destabilisation of Panama. What Poindexter wanted was for Panama to invade Nicaragua with American support, Noriega said.\" At no point was Noriega's alleged involvement in drugs mentioned. But the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) did contact him about drugs. They wrote to congratulate him on helping them to stop Panama being used as a drug and drug money-laundering centre! Just one month later, the Reagan-Bush administration demanded that Noriega be removed on the grounds of drugs, corruption, and lack of democracy. This from a government that, through agencies like the CIA, has supported and imposed some of the most grotesque dictatorships across the world to suit its own agenda, including the financing of terrorists to murder woman and children by the thousand. The same government that said Panamanian democracy was a lesson to Nicaragua. It is not easy to establish the motivation of Drug Enforcement Administration agents because among them are both people committed to stopping the flow of drugs into America and others equally determined to increase it. A number of DEA and CIA operatives have described how some officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration are involved in expanding the availability of hard drugs on the streets of the United States. Noriega's former chief adviser, Jose Blandon, has claimed that the DEA has protected the biggest players in the drug empires and that DEA officials paid Noriega $4.7 million to keep quiet. Dennis Dale, who headed a DEA operation in Central America, said in testimony that \"... the major targets of my investigations almost invariably turned out to be working for the CIA\".' In February 1988, Noriega was indicted on drugs charges and all but one were related to activities before 1984 when he was on the CIA payroll. Economic sanctions against Panama followed - the economic warfare that Poindexter had promised. If Noriega had agreed to support the US with Nicaragua, or hadn't fallen out with Bush, he would still be dictator of Panama instead of sitting in a US jail. When Bush officially became President in 1989, he made the ludicrous statement that Panama posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to US National Security and foreign policy. US News and World Report said on May 1st 1989 that Bush had authorised $10 million in CIA expenditure on projects against the Panama government. Some of the money was delivered by the CIA's Carlos Eleta Almaran, who had recently been arrested for drug trafficking. Bush ordered those charges to be dropped after Noriega was ousted. By December 20th 1989, with Noriega still"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. there despite the CIA's best efforts, United States forces invaded Panama. Thousands of civilians, including children, were killed. This was covered up by the Bush administration, but I have seen video footage of the devastation in civilian areas caused by the US attacks - areas that housed some of the poorest people in the country. The lives of the poor had already been devastated by US economic warfare. Noriega was abducted to America for trial and jailed on drugs charges. The rest of the \"free world\", including Britain's Margaret Thatcher, offered not a word of protest. The judge at his trial refused to allow any CIA documents to be seen in his defence and he was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. What, therefore, should Bush and other government and CIA officials receive if they ever came to trial? They would have to reincarnate many times to complete the sentence. One of the key prosecution witnesses in the \"trial\" of Noriega was Carlos Lehder. He is a co- founder of the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia and a business partner of the Bush family, who are fundamentally involved in the Medellin operation.\" Lehder, real name Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas, was extradited to the US on drugs charges and gave evidence against Noriega while saying nothing about the Bush connection. He was given a much-reduced sentence for his own drug convictions and then apparently \"disappeared\" from the US prison system.\" The \"leaders\" the Bush regime imposed on the people of Panama to replace Noriega were fundamentally connected with the money-laundering and drug-trafficking business. The new President, Guillermo Endara, was on official of at least six banks involved in drug money-laundering. The money laundered through these sources came from the Colombian drug-smuggling ring led by Augusto Falcon and Salvador Magluta, who were reported to be smuggling one ton of cocaine a month into Florida from the late 1970s until 1987. 57 The new Vice President in Panama installed by Bush was Ricardo Arias Calderon whose brother was president of the First Interamericas Bank when it was controlled by the Cali drug cartel. Official figures show that drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama after Noriega was ousted was greater than it had been when he was there. The invasion and US (Illuminati) puppet regimes that have followed also ensured that the United States would retain control of the Panama Canal zone that was officially handed back to Panama in 1999. The truth of what really happened in Panama was suppressed - as it was in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia ad infinitum - by the government and military control of the media. What happened in Panama happens everywhere these disturbed people take their murder machine. The media were not allowed to go anywhere that did not suit the official story and they were presented with \"news\" conferences in which US officials told the reporters whatever they wanted the people to believe. Other non-American journalists were arrested and a Spanish news photographer, Juantxu Rodriguez, was shot dead by US soldiers while he was taking incriminating pictures of what was really happening. There is, in fact, no independent footage of the three days of the invasion, only what the Bush government said had happened, and the Bush forces took over Panamanian television stations to broadcast their own propaganda. Can you imagine what the United States and Britain would say if any other country did this? These two are the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The Bush family crime \t 63 bullies of the world. It was the same with those who campaigned for democracy or opposed the US invasion. Thousands of such people on the \"dissident\" lists (human rights campaigners, independent newspaper editors, union leaders and so on) were j ailed without trial or even charge. Some stayed there for years. This systematic cover-up hid the fact that thousands of civilians were killed by the Bush invasion, not the 250 he claimed, and that tens of thousands were made homeless. Mass graves have since been uncovered of those who died unreported at the hands of Bush. (See the superb video, The Panama Deception, 58 which has pictures that Bush and his henchmen worked so hard to suppress). Bush the child abuser George Bush and his associate Henry Kissinger are mass murderers on a scale that beggars belief and so are those who support them and make it possible. The list of Illuminati slaughter and financial manipulation goes on and on with the manufactured wars and the CIA/British Intelligence-imposed dictators and killers placed in power across the world in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, Nicaragua, Panama, Grenada, Indonesia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan to name only a few. The dead, maimed, starving, destitute and dispossessed that have ensued can be numbered in billions of our fellow men, women and children. Now they have launched a \"war on terrorism\" that allows them to target any country they choose. But then why should people who sexually and violently abuse and murder little children have any emotional attachment to the suffering they daily orchestrate? Far fetched? No, no. If you read The Biggest Secret, Children Of The Matrix, and other books by researchers and victims of these people, you'll see this is no fantasy. George Bush, for example, is a notorious paedophile, torturer and killer of children among those who have researched this. In a book called Trance formation Of America,\" Cathy O'Brien, a mind-controlled slave of people like Bush and Dick Cheney for the first 30 years of her life, tells of her own and her daughter's abuse by Bush. Daughter Kelly was only a small child when Bush began his sexual and violent abuse of her, born as she was into the captivity in which her mother had long been imprisoned. This is just one of her experiences with President George Bush, father and controller of George W. Bush in the \"war on terrorism. Alex Houston was her CIA handler in the US government mind-control programme known as MK Ultra: \"Kelly became violently, physically ill after her induction into George Bush's ' neighborhood' and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter, she ran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilizing headaches for an average of three days. These were the only telltale evidences aside from the scarring burns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head 'hurt too bad even to move'. And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain and her rectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My own mind-control victimization rendered me unable to help or protect her ..."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

I have overheard of him speak blatantly of his sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to 'pull my strings' and control me. The psychological ramifications of being raped by a paedophile president are mind shattering enough, but reportedly Bush further reinforced his traumas to Kelly's mind with sophisticated NASA electronic and drug mind controlled devices. Bush also instilled the 'Who ya gonna call?' and 'I'll be watching you' binds on Kelly, further reinforcing her sense of helplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a child now seem trite in comparison to the brutal, physical and psychological devastation that Bush inflicted on my daughter.\"\" This man was in the White House for 12 years and now his son is president. Such a mentality would not plan and execute what happened on September 11th, an event that has so massively advanced the Illuminati agenda for a global fascist state? You must be joking.

From the moment of birth, probably even before if you read of the Illuminati \"in the womb\" techniques described in The Biggest Secret, he was, like his father, groomed and moulded to serve the Illuminati cause, and a look at his background presents September 11th and current events in a very different perspective. He attended Yale University and was initiated into the Skull and Bones Society and later Bohemian Grove before studying, at least in theory, at the Harvard Business School. Bush avoided the draft to Vietnam, a war created and perpetuated by the Illuminati who controlled his father. Washington Post staff writers George Lardner Jr and Lois Romano revealed in an article in 1999 how two weeks before he was due to graduate from Yale, Bush arrived at the offices of the Texas Air National Guard at Ellington Field outside Houston and said he wanted to sign up for pilot training.' This was on May 27th 1968 when the Vietnam War was at its peak with some 350 Americans dying every week and goodness knows how many Vietnamese. In 12 days' time he would have lost his student immunity from the draft and so he grasped, with his father's help, an escape route from combat by joining the National Guard. Father George was at this time a Congressman for Houston, and a supporter of the Vietnam conflict and the policy of sending American soldiers there to suffer and die. Many of the American elite were trying to pull the same trick for their sons and the National Guard had a long waiting list. Not only that, Boy George had scored only 25% in a pilot aptitude test and that was the lowest acceptable grade. That will surprise no one with a brain who sees him today, and all these factors should have prevented his admission and, therefore, his avoidance of the draft to Vietnam. Yet, wait for this ... Boy George was sworn in as an airman with the Texas Air National Guard on the same day that he applied. Colonel Walter B. \"Buck\" Staudt, the commander of the 147th Fighter Group, even staged a special ceremony later so he 67"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. could be photographed administering the oath for Bush instead of the captain who had sworn in Bush earlier. Staudt did the same when Bush was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Lloyd Bentsen Jr, a major Texas Democrat, ensured that his son, Lloyd Bentsen III, was enlisted into the National Guard by Staudt around the same ti me as Bush. Both were nominated for promotion to first lieutenant on the Election Day in 1970 when Father Bentsen beat Father Bush for a seat in the Senate. Other Vietnam avoiders in the Texas National Guard included the son of Republican Senator John Tower and at least seven members of the Dallas Cowboys American football team. The Washington Post article revealed: \"One address for those seeking help getting in was Ben Barnes, a Democrat who was then the speaker of the Texas House and a protege of Governor John B. Connally. A top aide to Barnes, Nick Kralj, simultaneously served as aide to the head of the Texas Air National Guard, the late Brigadier General James M. Rose. \"An anonymous letter addressed to a US attorney in Texas, produced in a discovery proceeding for an ongoing lawsuit, charged that Barnes assisted Bush in getting into the Guard. The suit was brought by the former director of the Texas Lottery Commission, who believes that Barnes, now a lobbyist, may have played a role in his dismissal. \"In a deposition for the suit, Kralj confirmed that he would get calls from Barnes or his chief of staff, Robert Spelling, `saying so-and-so is interested in getting in the Guard.' Kralj said he would then forward the names to Gen. Rose.\" 2 When the obvious questions were asked about this at the time of Bush's run for the presidency, Staudt said that no favouritism had been shown to him. You are a liar Colonel Staudt, as any idiot can see. Talking of which, Bush claimed he did not j oin the National Guard to avoid the Vietnam War that he and his father supported, but rather because he wanted to be a fighter pilot. OK, insult my intelligence some more. Even on his National Guard application forms he ticked the box saying, \"do not volunteer\" when asked if he wanted to go overseas. Not only did he avoid going to Vietnam, he was even able to live in his then home town of Houston while learning to be a pilot who was never to face a conflict. He served as an F-102 pilot with the Texas Air National Guard to avoid the draft to Vietnam and became a hard-drinking, cocaine-snorting, womaniser before \"discovering Jesus\" (I know, I know, of course that last bit is ludicrous, but this is the official story). On November 5th 1977 the annual anniversary of the Guy Fawkes (Percy-Bush family) plot to blow up the British Parliament, Bush married former teacher and librarian, Laura Welch, who is used to smokescreen his real lifestyle, and they have two teenage daughters, Barbara and Jenna. Snort, snort Bush's drug habit was brought to public attention - and then buried by the media - with the publication of the book, Fortunate Son: George Bush and the Making of a"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 69 President, in 1999. The author J.H. Hatfield was subjected to a national campaign of character assassination after he claimed that Bush was arrested on drug charges in 1972 while serving with the National Guard, but that this had been wiped from the record by a Republican judge and friend of his father in exchange for Bush's participation in a community service programme called Project PULL in Houston's inner city. The author cites three anonymous sources to support his claim. What is for sure is that suddenly, and for no credible reason, this hard- drinking playboy felt an overwhelming desire to volunteer to work with black inner-city kids in Project PULL. After Hatfield's character was attacked by the media and pressure from the Bush camp, the publisher, St Martin's Press, withdrew the book. But in early 2000 it was republished by Soft Skull Press, a small title on New York's Lower East Side, and the publisher, Sander Hicks, released a document from the Texas Air National Guard, which reveals that Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a medical exam in the same period that Hatfield says he was busted for cocaine possession. Bush's 175-page National Guard service records were obtained by Hicks from the Department of Defense through the Freedom of Information Act. They note the verbal orders of the \"Comdr on 1 Aug 72\" suspending Bush, a 27-year-old first lieutenant, for \"failure to accomplish annual medical examination\" while stationed at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. Hicks, who says he knows the identity of the three unconnected Hatfield sources, writes: \" Where was George W. Bush in 1972? Our author, J.H. Hatfield, cites three sources close to the Texas governor in the Afterword to Fortunate Son who state Bush had a cocaine arrest 'fixed' by his father in Houston in 1972. No one has adequately explained why he had a sudden charitable desire to perform community service at Project PULL, an inner-city youth center. Ironically, government documents note during the same period Bush's flying suspension for failure to take an annual medical examination, even though the Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly stated he was a healthy young man at the time. Combined with the new introduction to the book that cites an on-the-record admission by Michael Dannenhauer, former chief of staff to the elder Bush, that George W. was 'out of control' in his abuse of cocaine and alcohol and experienced 'lost weekends in Mexico' in the '70s, the Defense Department document adds further credibility to Hatfield and \"Fortunate Son.\"' 3 We should also note that this medical Bush failed to take included a drug test. The London Sunday Times reported in April 1972 that the Pentagon had ordered drug tests at least once a year for officers on \"extended active duty\", including reservists like Bush. Publisher Sander Hicks quotes Michael Dannenhauer as saying: \"There was cocaine use, lots of women, but the drinking was the worst.\" Bush lies yet again when he says that his 1972 flying suspension was because his doctor was in Houston while he was in Alabama working on a political campaign. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Lou Kaposta told Soft Skull Press:"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. \"According to my background of many years as a pilot in the Air Force, you have to take the annual physical as scheduled. You do not have a choice about when, where or how. You're in the military; the individual's desires don't count. Everybody knows that.\" 4 Former Staff Sergeant Mark Wilson, a veteran of the Texas Air National Guard, said there was \"something fishy\" about Bush's explanation. He told Soft Skull Press that Bush was stationed very near to Maxwell Air Force Base at the time and could easily have travelled there. Wilson also pointed out that Bush's initial physical exam, while still at Yale in 1968, was done at Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts.' So why did Bush only want to be examined by \"his doctor\" at the very time that Hatfield claims he was arrested for drug offences? James Howard Hatfield, the 43-year-old author of Fortunate Son, was found dead in his hotel room in Springdale, Arkansas, on July 18th 2001. Police said he had committed \"suicide\" from an overdose of prescription drugs. Hatfield left a wife and a daughter. Pope John Paul II was reported to have commented on Hatfield's death to reporters outside the Basilica of St Peter after saying mass: \"I met Jim Hatfield in Chicago when Fortunate Son was getting reprinted. He shook my hand and gave me a signed copy. I gave him my blessing and told him to go forth and speak the truth. He said, 'I am already doing that, Father'. We had a laugh together. They tell me he's dead now ... very tragic. He will be remembered in a series of special masses. I am sure that he is in heaven with our Lord, Jesus Christ, who said [in Matthew 5:1-2]: 'Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you for my sake. Rejoice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\"' 6 Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles Police Department narcotics investigator, goes further in his monthly newsletter, From The Wilderness.' He says that George W. Bush and his brother, Jeb, now Governor for Florida, were filmed in a 1985 \"sting\" by the US Drug Enforcement Agency at Tamiami airport outside Miami. Ruppert quotes statements made by Terry Reed, who took part in drug operations for the CIA and the Bush family involving the notorious and self- confessed drug smuggler Barry Seal, who was murdered when he began to talk too much. (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free and Reed's book, Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA.)' Ruppert says they arrived on the Bush plane King Air from the Intermountain regional airport at Mena, Arkansas, to pick up two kilos of cocaine from Seal. Mena was the location of the infamous and well- documented Mena airstrip drug operations involving the then Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). There are some interesting connections between this area, the Rockefeller family, Wal-Mart stores and China highlighted on the website of researcher and investigative journalist Sherman Skolnick.' What's for sure there is no way that the Bush sons have not been involved in drug trafficking when their father is one of the most active drug"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 71 barons in America, possibly the world. Terry Reed quotes in his book a conversation with Barry Seal about the Bush family drug operations. He says that Seal told him: \"Ever hear the old expression, it's not what ya know, it's who ya know? Well, whoever said that just hadn't caught the Vice President's kids in the dope business, 'cause I can tell ya for sure what ya know can definitely be more useful than who you know ...\" Reed asked Seal if he was saying that Father George Bush's kids were in the drug business: \"Yup, that's what I'm tellin' ya. A guy in Florida who flipped for the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] has got the goods on the Bush boys. Now I heard this earlier from a reliable source in Colombia, but I just sat on it then, waitin' to use it as a trump card, if I ever needed it. Well, I need to use it now. I got names, dates, places ... even got some tape recordin's. Fuck, I even got surveillance videos catchin' the Bush boys red handed. I consider this stuff my insurance policy ... Now this is real sensitive shit inside of US Customs and DEA and those guys are pretty much under control.\" 10 Barry Seal's \"insurance\" did not prove too effective, however, because he was silenced before he could tell his story to a bigger audience. In February 1986, soon after he began to speak out, he was murdered at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was blamed officially on two Colombian hitmen with Mac-10 machine guns, but while they may or may not have been the actual killers, the assassination was ordered by the highest levels of the United States government to stop his revelations about the Bush and Clinton involvement in the drug racket through Mena, Arkansas. Clinton said at a press conference at the time that he knew very little about Seal, but a number of people reported seeing them dining together at Fu Lin's, one of Clinton's favourite restaurants in Little Rock.\" Noelle Bush, the 24-year-old daughter of Jeb Bush, was arrested in January 2001 for prescription drug fraud involving an anti- anxiety drug similar to Valium. 12 I understand her need for that after being brought up by the Bush family and living with Jeb at the governor's mansion in Florida. With stunning hypocrisy, Jeb Bush said at the time: \"Unfortunately, substance abuse is an issue confronting many families across our nation ...\" 13 Yes, but not every family has made billions from making those substances available on the streets of America. Stewart Webb is a private investigator who has uncovered the Bush family connections to the drugs trade and the major American financial firms who launder the money for them. He said: \"George Jr., Jeb and Neil Bush were all party to the crimes involving drugs and gun money laundering through Silverado Savings in Denver. They were all aware of 'poppy' George's schemes using CIA, Israeli Mossad, Homestead Air Force Base and Mena, Arkansas to import drugs and ship weapons.\" 14"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Yes, weapons to terrorists! Webb also highlights the Bush family involvement in financial fraud and murder, but his calls for a Grand Jury investigation into his findings have been ignored. The Bush - Bin Laden connection You will have noted earlier how Father George went to war against former business and CIA associates like Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega. Such people are friends while they are useful and foes when they are either a liability or more useful as enemies in the battle for control of human perception. These are fodder in a game that is far bigger than such people understand. You might expect, given this pattern, that the Bush and bin Laden families would have a history of connections and cooperation. And yes, so they have. The official story is that the bin Laden family has broken ties with Osama, their terrorist relative, but the only evidence we have for this are statements made by the bin Laden family and US Intelligence and government sources. What the hell kind of proof is that when they all have a stake in the public believing this version of events? Many others doubt these claims, and I agree. To say all ties have been severed is nonsense. The San Antonio Express-News quoted Yossef Bodansky, the director of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, as saying that \"Osama maintains connections\" with some of his nearly two dozen brothers, but he would not elaborate.\" The FBI must have had their doubts because it subpoenaed banks used by the bin Laden family in search of records detailing their financial activities, according to a source quoted by the Wall Street journal.\" The BBC's Newsnight current affairs programme revealed that far from accepting that the bin Laden family is innocent of any criminal activity, members of their clan were being investigated by the FBI before September 11th. Reporter Greg Palast presented an FBI document with the code 1991-WF-213589, which revealed how agents of the Washington field office were investigating Abdullah bin Laden, the president, treasurer and US Director of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth ( WAMY) on the grounds of national security.\" WAMY has been suspected of funding terrorism, including the al-Qaeda* network of Osama bin Laden. His brothers, Abdullah bin Laden and Omar bin Laden, another FBI suspect, lived in the Washington suburb of Falls Church, Virginia, at 3411 Silver Maple Place. This is close to the headquarters of WAMY in the basement at 5613 Leesburg Pike, and two blocks away is the house at 5913 Leesburg where four of the alleged hijackers named by the FBI after September 11th are said to have stayed.\" This area is close to the CIA headquarters at Langley. WAMY says it's a charity, but about the same time as the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Pakistani authorities expelled WAMY representatives. Officials in India also claimed that WAMY was funding an organisation connected to bombings in Kashmir. The Philippines military said that WAMY was funding Islamic insurgency. 19 * There are several different spellings of al-Qaeda and I have chosen this version. Other spellings will appear in some direct quotes."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 73 George W. Bush, who claims to be so determined to stop the funding of Osama bin Laden, has not frozen WAMY's assets, and Joe Trento, a \"national security expert\", told Newsnight that the FBI wanted to continue its inquiries into WAMY and Abdullah bin Laden, but was not allowed to do so. Trento said he had obtained a secret file which revealed that FBI investigations considered that WAMY fitted the pattern of organisations funding terrorism that had been bankrolled by the Saudi royal family (who are \"advised\" by Father George Bush) and some of the 20,000 Saudi princes. Back in the early 1990s WAMY was being named as a channel for public and private Saudi donations to hardline Islamic organisations. One recipient of WAMY support has been the Students Islamic Movement of India that supported Pakistani-backed terrorists in Kashmir and wants an Islamic state in India . 20 Reporter Greg Palast said that Newsnight had uncovered a long history of shadowy connections between the US State Department, the CIA and the Saudis. Michael Springman, the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah from 1987 to 1989, told Newsnight: \"In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials to i ssue visas to unqualified applicants. These were, essentially, people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I complained bitterly at the time there. I returned to the US, I complained to the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General's office. I was met with silence. \" What I was protesting was in reality an effort to bring recruits, rounded up by Osama bin Laden, to the United States for terrorist training by the CIA, who then returned to Afghanistan to fight against the then Soviet Union.\" 21 This was during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and their war with the CIA-backed Mujaheddin, including Osama bin Laden. In the period Springman is talking about here, between 1987 and 1989, Father George Bush, the former head of the CIA, officially took control of the White House after being president, in fact if not name, under Ronald Reagan. Newsnight also quoted \"a highly placed source in a US intelligence agency\" as saying there had always been \"constraints\" on investigating Saudis and that, under President Boy George Bush, it had become much worse. FBI agents felt that their investigations into the Saudi connection were being obstructed from the highest level in Washington, Newsnight reported, despite terrorism against Americans being blamed on Osama bin Laden and his Saudi- based backers. These included the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, which killed six people and injured a thousand, and the Khobar Towers at a US military complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, three years later in which 19 Americans died and some 500 were injured. This was blamed on Osama bin Laden and yet his family business, Bin Laden Construction, was given the contract by the US to replace it! 22"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Bush blocks bin Laden investigation Newsnight reported that after George W. became president, FBI agents were told to \"back off\" investigations into the bin Laden-Saudi connection. Greg Palast said that just a few days after September 11th, and while Muslim \"suspects\" were being rounded up all over America, a special charter flight flew 11 members of the bin Laden family out of the United States to Saudi Arabia from the same Boston Airport from which the attacks on the World Trade Center had been launched. As I mentioned, Yossef Bodansky, director of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, said that bin Laden maintains connections with some of his nearly two dozen brothers, although he would not elaborate.\" Osama bin Laden has been ostracised and disinherited by his family? Like hell he has and the Bushes, the bin Ladens and the Saudi royal family are all extremely close. This is confirmed by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie in their French book, Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth. Brisard is a private intelligence analyst who compiled a report for French intelligence in 1997 about the financing of \"bin Laden's\" al-Qaeda terrorist network and Dasquie is editor of Intelligence Online. Brisard says they prove in their book that at least until 1998 bin Laden was able to use economic and financial structures in Saudi Arabia and had contacts with various Saudi officials. After all, the Saudis were supporting the Taliban, who were protecting him in Afghanistan. \"In Saudi Arabia, the left hand ignores the right hand,\" Brisard says, \"and the FBI was fully aware of the situation.\" 24 Brisard reveals in his book that John O'Neill, the FBI's former deputy director and head of anti-terrorism, resigned in July 2001 because the Boy Bush State Department was blocking the investigation into the bombing in the Yemen of the USS Cole, an attack blamed on bin Laden. Brisard says that O'Neill told him: \"The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism were US oil interests and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.\" When Brisard asked him why the US was unwilling to go after the states that host bin Laden, he said \"because of oil\". Brisard revealed in an Internet interview: \"I quote [O'Neill] saying that everything about bin Laden and al-Qaida can be explainable through Saudi Arabia.\" 25 In the greatest of \"coincidences\", John O'Neill left the FBI to become head of security at the World Trade Center and died in the attacks on September 11th. It was apparently his first day in the job. Lawyer Michael Wildes gave some 14,000 documents to the FBI implicating Saudis in the funding of terrorism. They came from a defecting Saudi diplomat represented by Wildes, but the lawyer says that FBI agents told him they were \"not permitted\" to read them and would not take them . 26 He said of the FBI: \"They're cut off at the hip sometimes by supervisors or given shots that are being called from Washington at the highest levels ... You see a difference between the rank-and-file counter-intelligence agents, who are regarded by some as the motor pool of the FBI, who drive following diplomats, and the people who are getting the shots called at the highest level of our government, who have a different agenda - i t's unconscionable.\" 21"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 75 In the wake of September 11th, FBI Special Agents were furious with the way their investigations into potential terrorists and their funding were blocked. One filed an official complaint with legal representation from David Schippers, the man who led the attempted impeachment of Bill Clinton, and Judicial Watch, the private Washington organisation that investigates and prosecutes official corruption. FBI Special Agent Robert Wright, Jr, who spent four years tracking terrorist money laundering in the United States, believes that if investigations had been allowed to continue, the attacks on the World Trade Center could have been stopped.\" Wright told the media in May 2002 that the FBI operation, code-named \"Vulgar Betrayal\", confiscated funds that were directly linked to Saudi Arabian businessman Yassin Kadi, also known as Yassin al-Qadi, who has since been identified as one of the \"chief money launderers\" for Osama bin Laden. Wright said that FBI management \"intentionally and repeatedly thwarted and obstructed\" his efforts to expand the investigation to arrest other terrorists and seize their assets. In August 1999 he was removed from the operation, which was then shut down. \"As a direct result of the incompetence and, at times, intentional obstruction of justice by FBI management to prevent me from bringing the terrorists to justice,\" he said, \"Americans have unknowingly been exposed to potential terrorist attacks for years.\" 29 Long before September 11th lawyer David Schippers tried himself to warn Attorney General John Ashcroft about the concerns of FBI agents that a terrorist attack on lower Manhattan was planned, but he never received a reply. Schippers was contacted by a number of genuine FBI agents about their concerns. He described the investigations into the funding of terrorism: \"This agent here in Chicago filed the affidavit where he laid out the whole way that the money moves, the way that its handled, how it comes out of the Middle East into the Chicago area, not only Chicago, but into the United States, how it's covered, how the operatives are covered, and then how the money gets back, how it's transferred back, and where it's kept while it's here. And that affidavit ran like 30 pages - laid it out ... He had to go through hell on earth in Washington. He had to fight like a tiger. Everybody i n his own bureau and in the Department of Justice was against him and still is. 3o Bush and bin Laden: business partners So why would the US government want to block investigations into Osama bin Laden and other terrorist networks? Here's why. Boy George was a disastrous businessman when he followed his father, or \"Poppy\", into the oil and gas industry, but he was always bankrolled or manipulated out of trouble by his father and his friends. He launched his own drilling company in June 1977 in the Texas oil town of Midland. It was called Arbusto Energy and the \"bust\" in the name was very appropriate. \"Arbusto\", however, means \"shrub\" in Spanish (again spot on), although it seems his family believed it translated as bush. Now ... one of the investors in Baby Bush's Arbusto venture was one Salem bin Laden, a close friend of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and brother of the \"world's most wanted man,\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"76 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Osama bin Laden. The Saudi Bin Laden Group, formerly Bin Laden Brothers Construction, is one of the biggest construction companies in the Middle East with some 40,000 employees, and it has long associations with the US government and prominent American families. This was the company that helped to build American airfields in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War and, as we shall see, built the cave and tunnel complexes with CIA funding that the United States bombed during the attacks on Afghanistan after September 11th. Charles Freeman, president of the Middle East Policy Council (funded by the bin Laden family) and former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, says: \"If there were ever any company closely connected to the US and its presence in Saudi Arabia, it's the Saudi Bin Laden Group.\" 31 Wayne Fagan, a San Antonio attorney who represented Salem bin Laden from 1982 to 1988, told the San Antonio Express-News that his client was \"a good friend of the US government\". 32 Salem bin Laden, investor to George W. Bush, became head of the bin Laden companies with the death in a plane crash of the family patriarch, Sheikh Mohammed bin Laden, in 1968. The Sheik left his industrial and financial empire to some 54 sons and daughters from a list of wives. Salem bin Laden, the oldest son, took over the estate in 1972. Salem bin Laden became a business partner of George W. Bush through a middleman called James R. Bath, a close friend of the Bush family and best buddy of Boy George. They \"served\" in the same Texas Air National Guard unit. Indeed, the document obtained by Soft Skull Press, which reveals how Bush was suspended from flying in the same period that J. H. Hatfield said he was busted for cocaine, shows that his friend, Major James R. Bath, also failed to take his annual medical examination and was suspended from flying! It was shortly after Father George became director of the CIA in 1976 that Salem bin Laden appointed Bath, the very close friend of \"Dubya\", to represent his \"business interests\" out of the Bush family stronghold of Houston, Texas. Bill White, a former real estate partner of Bath, said that Bath told him he was an asset of the CIA and that \"he had been recruited by [Father] George Bush himself in 1976 when Bush was director of the agency ... he said Bush wanted him involved with the Arabs, and to get into the aviation business\". During this early period as an asset of Bush's CIA, Bath was at Boy George's side when he ran unsuccessfully to be governor of Texas in 1978 and Bath (the bin Laden family?) helped to finance the campaign. Bill White's claims forced Bath to admit in sworn depositions that he represented four wealthy Saudi Arabian businessmen as a trustee and used his name on their investments in return for a 5% commission on their business deals. At the same time Bath, the buddy of Boy George, was both put on the CIA payroll by Father George to get involved with the Arabs and the aviation business, and appointed by Salem bin Laden and other bin Laden-connected Arabs as their Texas representative. This connection led to Salem bin Laden investing in George W. Bush's Arbusto oil company. The allegations of Bill White that his former partner James Bath channelled money from Middle Eastern clients to American companies to influence the decisions of the Reagan-Bush administrations were \"investigated\" by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a division of the Justice Department. But,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 77 of course, nothing came of it. White told a Texas court in 1992 that Bath and the Justice Department had \"blackballed\" him professionally and financially because he refused to stop revealing his knowledge of the Arab money paid into the bank accounts of American businesses and politicians. At the time of this justice Department \"review\" of Bill White's evidence, a senior position in the department was held by Robert Mueller. This same Robert Mueller was appointed head of the FBI by George W. Bush and took over just two weeks before September 11th. This is the FBI from which the official story of 9 / 11 has come. The head of the Justice Department's criminal division under President Father George, which cleared major players in the BCCI scandal, including Bush, was also ... Robert Mueller. Having a few little doubts about Mueller's FBI version of September 11th? Yeah, me too. Boy George, the bin Ladens, and the BCC1 By 1977, using Bath as the middleman, Salem bin Laden was investing in Dubya's Arbusto drilling company. This association continued, not least through the Illuminati's BCCI, which provided \"banking services\" for the Medellin drug cartel, Khun Sa (a major player in the heroin trafficking out of Asia), Manuel Noriega, Saddam Hussein, and terrorists like Abu Nidal, who, according to the former German Defence Minister and overseer of German intelligence, Andreas von Bulow, is an \"instrument of Mossad\", the Israeli intelligence agency.\" The BCCI was also the main route for the funds of CIA covert operations that involved the Iran-Contra scandal and the funding of Osama bin Laden and others in Afghanistan who were resisting the Soviet Union occupation in the 1980s during the Reagan-Bush era. The result of this CIA funding through the BCCI and other sources was the creation of the Osama bin Laden network and the coming to power of the Taliban regime. The Bush family were massively involved with the BCCI and these super-rich Middle Eastern families, like the bin Ladens. Ed Rogers, Father George's White House political director, who sat in on presidential meetings, left to work for Sheikh Kamal Adham, the American representative of the BCCI and significantly a former chief of Saudi intelligence and a friend of Adnan Khashoggi, the infamous arms dealer. Khashoggi is a business associate of Father George Bush and one-time brother-in- law to Mohamed al-Fayed. When Father Bush was asked if he was concerned that a senior member of his staff had left to represent a Saudi sheikh accused of being a key player in the BCCI scandal, he said Rogers was free to do whatever he chose and Bush's only concern was that the White House was \"beyond any perception of i mpropriety\"' Note ... not beyond impropriety, just any perception of it. Rogers was hired to ensure good communications between the sheikh and Bush. As a Senate investigation into the BCCI revealed, Rogers left the White House and was paid $600,000 to do next to nothing. It was the same with his assistant, Haley Barbour, who would turn up later as the chairman of the National Republican Committee. The Senate investigation concluded that hiring Rogers and giving \"gifts\" of money to the president's son, George W. Bush, were designed to influence Father Bush's policies in relation to the BCCI. 35 Like his father, Salem bin Laden died in a plane crash near San Antonio on Memorial Day, May 29th 1988. It is amazing"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"78 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. how dangerous flying can be when you get involved with the Bush family and their Illuminati associates. Indeed it was considered an unexplainable \"freak\" accident with bin Laden, a very experienced pilot, inexplicably turning his ultralight aircraft the wrong way on take-off and hitting power lines. Or so the story goes. Bush associate finances bin Laden Bush buddy James Bath made his fortune from commissions for investing the money of Salem bin Laden and another Saudi who becomes very significant in the tale. This is Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, another investor in a George W. Bush oil company. Bin Mahfouz was the operational director of the BCCI and a controlling shareholder with a 20% stake between 1986 and 1990. He is one of the world's richest men and ... a financial supporter of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network! His sister is a wife of Osama bin Laden, as revealed by CIA Director James Woolsey in his testimony to the Senate in 1998. ; h Khalid bin Mahfouz and Salem bin Laden were closely associated and Dubya's close friend James Bath worked for both of them, as he did for Gaith Pharaon, the BCCI's front man in Houston's Main Bank and a close associate of bin Mahfouz. In 1978, Bath bought Houston's Gulf Airport for Salem bin Laden and when he died in the \"ultralight crash\" ownership passed to bin Mahfouz. He has a big estate in Houston, the home base of Father George. Bath was also president of Skyway Aircraft Leasing Ltd, a Texas air charter company registered in the Cayman Islands, which was really owned by bin Mahfouz according to published reports in the early 1990s.\" There was a long association between Boy George's associate James Bath and bin Mahfouz. Bath received a \"loan\" of $1.4 million from him in 1990. Khalid bin Mahfouz is from the Yemen, as were the bin Ladens originally. He was for many years the banker to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and to Father George Bush. Bin Mahfouz was known as \"the king's treasurer\" in Saudi Arabia. Yet after the terrorist attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s, which were blamed on Osama bin Laden, President Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright informed the Saudi Defence Minister, Prince Sultan, that bin Mahfouz had channelled tens of millions of dollars into terrorist groups through accounts in London and New York. According to USA Today, quoting \"intelligence sources\", bin Mahfouz and other Saudis combined to transfer $3 million to various Osama bin Laden front operations in Saudi Arabia in 1999.'° The paper reported that a year after bin Laden was blamed for the attacks on US embassies in Africa, Khalid bin Mahfouz and other wealthy Saudis ordered the National Commercial Bank (owned by bin Mahfouz and used by the bin Laden family) 39 to transfer funds to the Capitol Trust Bank in New York City. This money was deposited with Islamic charities connected to the bin Laden network in the United States and United Kingdom .41 The organisations alleged to have been used by bin Mahfouz and associates to fund terrorist groups, especially bin Laden, include: the London-based Advice and Reformation Committee; Blessed Relief, an African aid group whose directors included bin Mahfouz's son, Abdul Rahman Mahfouz; a Kenya branch of Help Africa People, controlled by people later convicted or indicted for the US embassy"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 79 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; the International Islamic Relief Organization, which has been linked with terrorist bomb plots in the Philippines and India; the Kenya branch of Mercy International, a war and famine relief group where evidence used to convict the embassy bombers was found; and a list of other organisations, some of which have been named by President Bush since September 11th as fronts for terrorism (he should know).\" Here's another example of how small the world is at this level. The Capitol Trust Bank through which at least some of these funds for Osama bin Laden are said to have been channelled is run by bin Mahfouz associate Mohammad Hussein Al- Amoudi, who is also alleged to have funded bin Laden. Al-Amoudi's lawyer has been Vernon Jordan, the close associate of Bill Clinton and friend of Monica Lewinsky. Jordan was for many years a senior executive in the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld in Washington, along with several close friends of the Bush family. In January 2000 Jordan moved to the New York investment bank of Lazard Freres, but retains close connections to the law firm he has served since 1982. He also sits on the boards of major corporations like American Express, the Revlon Group, Xerox Corporation and Dow Jones.\" Akin, Gump represent some interesting combinations of people and organisations. These include bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi, who are alleged to have funded Osama bin Laden; they also handle the affairs of many leading Saudis through the Akin, Gump office in the capital, Riyadh; and they represent the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, which had its assets frozen by the US Treasury pending an investigation into alleged connections to the Palestinian terrorist group, Hamas. 43 Bin Mahfouz retained the services of Akin, Gump during the \"investigation\" into the BCCI.\" The National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia, reported to be the world's biggest private bank, was owned by bin Mahfouz, but he was forced to step back when an audit by the Saudi government revealed that $2 billion was \"missing\". There has, of course, been much speculation into where, or more to the point, to whom, that money went. I emphasise again, the National Commercial Bank is one of the major banks used by the bin Laden family empire and the royal family of Saudi Arabia. Bin Mahfouz was put under \"house arrest\" and the last I heard he was \"living in luxury at a military hospital in the northern city of Taif, where he is allegedly undergoing treatment for a drug problem\". Taif is only a short distance from the bin Laden family headquarters in Jeddah. Bin Mahfouz also had to hand over the Irish passports he had bought for millions of dollars for himself, ten of his wives, and business associates. Nothing really changed, however, because another family member, Mohammed bin Mahfouz, took over the National Commercial Bank along with close family business associate, Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, who is based in Ethiopia and heads a vast network of companies involved in oil, banking, mining and construction. These include the Capitol Trust Bank that was named by the Clinton administration as a vehicle for funding Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network. The bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi families control three private Saudi Arabian oil companies and are partners with United States firms in a series of major"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"$0 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. oil development and pipeline projects in central and south Asia. Of course, the Bushes, Vice President Dick Cheney and many others in the US government are closely involved with the oil cartel. The Mahfouz-Al-Amoudi companies, Delta Oil, Nimir Petroleum and Corral Petroleum, formed international consortiums with United States oil giants Pennzoil (Bush family), Texaco, Unocal, Amerada Hess and Frontera Resources. Unocal is a Texas-based group that has been planning to build a massive pipeline across Afghanistan, but could not do so while the Taliban was in power. Despite their connections with Osama bin Laden, these US companies, bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi, have not had their assets frozen in the Bush sham to \"stop money reaching terrorist organisations\". The American publication, Village Voice, was therefore right to conclude: \"It is most curious that the son of former CIA Director George Bush does business with the brother of Osama bin Laden in the setting up of businesses which seem very tied to the CIA - while at the same time a woman with CIA ties and who is married into the family of former CIA Director Richard Helms represents the Taliban, protector of Osama bin Laden. This coziness among the CIA and bin Laden families all suggest to me that perhaps Osama bin Laden may still very much be a CIA-protected operative, and makes me very nervous about who really orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.\" 45 What a tangled web we weave ... Once again, bin Mahfouz, the financial supporter of Osama bin Laden, was an investor in a George W. Bush oil company. Dubya's original company, Arbusto, went through changes of name with each financial failure. It became Bush Exploration when Father George became US Vice President and in September 1984 this survived only by merging with Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation. With Boy George appointed president of Spectrum, this of course also failed, and merged with Harken Energy in 1986. He was a shareholder, director and adviser to Harken and, a year later, with Harken now in trouble, along came the \"investment\" by Osama bin Laden supporter, Khalid bin Mahfouz. 46 He paid $25 million to acquire a 17.6% stake in the company through his US representative, Abdullah Taha Bakhsh. Mahfouz at the same time was a 20% controlling shareholder in BCCI, which official investigations revealed to be financing terrorist groups, unlawful \"intelligence\" operations and laundering vast amounts of drug money. Despite being a leading figure in the BCCI while it perpetrated the biggest financial fraud in history, bin Mahfouz escaped all liabilities, except for a $225-million-dollar settlement agreed with New York \"prosecutors\". This was pin money for him. With the Bush family so heavily involved in the BCCI it is not a surprise that it should be connected to the companies of George W. Bush. Hey, Jack's back Abdullah Taha Bakhsh also purchased a 9.6% stake for bin Mahfouz in the Worthen Banking Corporation in Arkansas, owned by another significant character in the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 81 story, Jackson Stephens, who funded Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and much of his political career. Bakhsh's purchase was identical to the shares in Worthen sold by three investors, Bill Clinton, Pat Robertson, the television \"evangelist\" (see Children Of The Matrix), and Mochtar Riady, the head of an Indonesian family that has close connections to the Chinese communists.\" Jackson Stephens was a major financial supporter of Bill Clinton, but is also a close associate of the Bush family in America's one-party state. He was also closely connected with the BCCI and the Bush banker and bin Laden funder, Khalid bin Mahfouz. In a sworn statement for his lawsuit against Father George, the former Green Beret, William Tyree, said that Stephens \"paid off politicians from Arkansas to look the other way and ignore the CIA cocaine operation at Mena, Arkansas.\" 48 In 1987, Stephens, who was also linked to the Clintons' Whitewater property scandal through the Worthen Bank, invested $25 million in ... Boy George's Harken Energy. The deal was set up in Geneva and the money paid through Union des Banques Suisses and Banque de Commerce et de Placements, a Geneva branch of the BCCI. The deal was signed by Stephens and Abdullah Taha Bakhsh, the representative of bin Mahfouz. Stephen's company, Stephens Inc., donated $100,000 to Father George's re-election campaign in 1991, despite being a funder of Bill Clinton. His wife, Mary Anne Stephens, ran Father George's presidential election campaign in Arkansas in 1988 and when Boy George was manipulated into the presidency with the fixed vote in Florida in 2000, Jackson Stephens made a considerable contribution to the cost of his inauguration bash. Forget the \"two-party\" or \"multi-party\" state deal. It doesn't exist. These guys are masks on same face. When you observe the fundamental and constant connections between the Bushes, the bin Laden family, their cronies and investors, and the BCCI, including its operational director Khalid bin Mahfouz, it is sobering to note that a 400-page French parliamentary report, published on October 10th 2001, said that the Osama bin Laden financial network bore a striking resemblance to that of the BCCI. Loser takes it all Dubya's family and business connections made him a fortune from his failed oil company in its various incarnations. With Arbusto failing, he was made president of the company that bought it, Spectrum 7 Energy, and was given 14% of its stock while other Arbusto investors were paid 20 cents on the dollar. When Spectrum 7 lost $400,000 in six months Bush sold to Harken Energy and again received a large stock holding and a big salary as consultant and director. While Father George was US President in 1990, his son's Harken Energy was given a lucrative contract by the government of Bahrain even though Harken had never drilled a well overseas or offshore. The deal was brokered in part by David Edwards, one of Bill Clinton's closest friends, and a former employee of Stephens Inc., owned by Jackson Stephens. Clinton himself is a gofer for the Bushes and Rockefellers. The contract was awarded to Bush's company thanks to Sheikh Kalifah, the Prime Minister of Bahrain, another BCCI shareholder.\" Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynne in their book, The Outlaw Bank: A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of the BCCI, write that"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"82 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. \"Knowledgeable oil company sources believe that the Bahrain oil concession was indeed an oblique favor to the president of the United States but say that Saudi Arabia [home of bin Laden] was behind the decision.\"\" Choosing a small company with no track record was indeed a strange decision unless you know the background and personnel. Harken immediately subcontracted the work to the CIA-connected Global Marine and no oil was found. Bahrain officials say they had no idea that the President's son was involved with Harken when they awarded the contract. No, honest, they really said that. Above the law Insider trading - using privileged information to trade stocks - is strictly illegal and yet how can the following not be considered so? Two months before Iraq invaded Kuwait on June 20th 1990, Boy George suddenly sold two-thirds of his stock in Harken Energy, and the 121,140 shares netted him $848,560 - that's $318,430 more than they were worth according to Dr Arthur F. Ide, the author of George W. Bush: Portrait of a Compassionate Conservatives' Eight days after Bush sold his stock, Harken announced second quarter losses of $23 million, Saddam Hussein then invaded Kuwait and the value of the company plummeted 75%. As Ide wrote: \"George W. broke the law to [sell his shares] since the transaction was an insider stock sale.\" 52 Bush was cleared, however, by an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an Illuminati front dealing in financial law. It prosecutes those the Illuminati want to destroy and clears the ones they want to protect. An Associated Press report pointed out: \"At the time of the investigation, Bush's father was President of the United States and the SEC was run by one of his biggest political supporters, Richard Breeden. The SEC's then-general counsel, James R. Doty, was another staunch presidential supporter who as a private attorney was George W. Bush's lawyer when he purchased his share of the Texas Rangers baseball team.\" 53 Yet another stitch-up and there's more. Bush was defended in the investigation by the Dallas attorney, Robert Jordan. When he became US President, Boy George appointed Jordan as his ambassador to Saudi Arabia - a country that was to become extremely important a few months later when the \"war on terrorism\" was launched. This is, of course, the base of the bin Laden family and other Bush and terrorism funders like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Jordan has no diplomatic experience, but that's not the point. As always it is his loyalty to the Bush family that counts. Must be genetic ... When faced with questions about his bin Laden connections, President Dubya denied at first ever knowing his long-time friend and bin Laden family business associate, James Bath. This was an outrageous and a ludicrous lie. He then agreed that Bath had invested in Arbusto and that he knew he was a representative of Saudi Arabian interests (the bin Laden family and Khalid bin \"BCCI\" Mahfouz)."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 83 Bush also lied to the Wall Street journal when he said he had \"no idea\" that the BCCI was involved in Harken Energy's finances. In fact, Harkeri s affairs were awash with people directly connected to the BCCI. The Journal quite rightly concluded that \"The number of BCCI-connected people who had dealings with Harken - all since George W. Bush came on board - raises the question of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presidential son.\" ' In fact, it goes far, far, deeper than that. The Bush family is crooked to the core and the children have been brought up to be that way Dubya's brother Neil Bush was fined $50,000 in 1990 and banned from banking activities for his role in taking down Silverado Savings and Loans, a failure that cost taxpayers $1.3 billion and resulted from the \"Reaganomics\" policies of the 1980s that were orchestrated by the real power in the Oval Office, George Bush. Father George was US President when Silverado collapsed. A Resolution Trust Corporation suit against Neil Bush and other officers of Silverado was settled for $26.5 million. He voted to give $100 million in \"loans\" (bad ones it turned out) to two of his business partners while failing to tell his fellow board members at Silverado that they were his business partners. Federal banking investigators also followed the trail of defaulted loans to Neil Bush oil ventures like JNB International, an oil and gas exploration company that was awarded drilling concessions in Argentina even though it had no experience of international oil and gas drilling. Heard that story somewhere before? Neil Bush now runs an \"educational software\" company called Ignite out of Austin, Texas, and in January 2002 he was the keynote speaker at an \"international forum\" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, home of the bin Laden family, and they were the main backers of the event.\" The Carlyle Group - a name to remember Khalid bin Mahfouz, the financial backer of Osama bin Laden and George W. Bush, is also an investor in the Carlyle Group, the international consulting and investment firm of Father George. It was founded in 1987 and named after the favourite New York hotel of the company's initial investors, the high-Illuminati Mellon family, the close friends of the British royal family and the force behind the lie that fluoride is good for you (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). The Carlyle Group also has very close links with the bin Laden family, who have been both clients and investors. Father Bush has been a paid consultant to the Bin Laden Group. Reports in the Wall Street Journal say these Carlyle investments have been earning the bin Laden family some 40% a year on their money since 1995. 56 So when the US boosts its military spending, as it has so massively done in the \"war on terrorism\", bin Laden family investments in a defence contractor like Carlyle clearly benefit. According to the New York Times: \"Carlyle has ownership stakes in 164 companies which last year employed more than 70,000 people and generated $16 billion in revenues. About 450 institutions - mainly large pension funds and banks - are Carlyle investors ... \" 5' Carlyle owns a wide range of companies involved in \"health care\", real estate, the Internet, bottling plants, the media (including, it is reported, the French newspaper, Le Figaro), as well as companies producing tanks, aircraft parts and a long list of other military equipment. It is now a major player in"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. defence contracting and telecommunications and invests in companies that do business with governments or are affected by government regulations. The Wall Street journal called the Carlyle Group \"... a well-connected Washington merchant bank specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies.\" 58 Almost two- thirds of Carlyle's investments are in defence and telecommunications companies that are fundamentally affected by changes in government spending and policy because they know they can influence both, especially if one of your leading lights has his son in the White House. Dubya, himself, was an investor and board member of the Carlyle subsidiary, Caterair. Well, well, what a line-up Father George sat on the Carlyle board and is still very much involved as a constantly active senior consultant who nets, apparently, between $80,000 and $100,000 for every speech he makes on its behalf. He is also the senior adviser to Carlyle's Asian Partners fund.\" Another Carlyle stalwart is James Baker, Bush's Secretary of State at the time of the Gulf War, and the man who was allocating contracts to American corporations to clear up the oil fires in Kuwait even before the conflict began. Baker is on the Carlyle board, as is former Reagan-Bush Defense Secretary, Frank Carlucci, who is the Carlyle chairman and managing director. Carlucci was number two at the CIA during the Vietnam War, assistant director of the CIA during the Jimmy Carter presidency, and both Secretary of Defense and National Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan (George Bush). He is also a past chairman of Nortel Networks Corp., which has been a partner of the Bin Laden Group in telecommunication deals. Karl Evanzz in his book, The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X, 6 ° says that Carlucci's appointment as consul and second- secretary of the US Embassy in Stanleyville, the Congo, was a cover for a CIA operation that included the plot to assassinate the recently elected President Patrice Lumumba in 1961. When someone is freely elected to serve the people and not the Illuminati they must be removed. Five months after Lumumba was assassinated, Carlucci was arrested, expelled from the Congo, and returned to the US. He was expelled again in 1965, this time from Tanzania, after he was implicated in the CIA assassination of the Burundi Prime Minister Pierre Ngendandumwe. This is the man who now heads the Carlyle Group with its fundamental connections to the Bush and bin Laden families. In relation to the agenda behind the \"war on terrorism\", it is important to note that Carlyle's Carlucci and James Baker are close friends and associates of the current US Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Baker was a classmate of Rumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld's roommate at Yale. , ' Secretary of State Colin Powell has also described Carlucci as his \"mentor\". Carlucci admits that in February 2001 he met with Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, the Gulf War Defense Secretary to Father George, to talk about military policy. This was at a time when Carlyle had several defence projects worth billions of dollars under consideration. How hilarious, therefore, are the comments of Carlucci when he said: \"I've made it clear that I don't lobby the defense industry. I"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 85 will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and whom they should talk to. But I do not pick up the phone and say you should fund X, Y or Z.\" 62 Then there are the claims of David Rubenstein, one of Carlyle's founders and a former aide to the Jimmy Carter administration that was served at the CIA by Carlucci. Rubenstein said: \"Mr [Father George] Bush gives us no advice on what do with the federal government. We've gone over backwards to make sure that we do no lobbying.\" 63 To quote Santa Claus: \"Ho, ho, ho.\" But even funnier was the claim by Daniel A. D'Aniello, a Carlyle managing director, that \"We are greatly assisted by Baker and Bush ... [because] ... It shows that we are associated with people of the highest ethical standards.\" That's about as wrong as any sentence has ever been in all human history. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity, hit the button when he said: \"Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can possibly be. [Father] Bush is getting money from private interests that have business before the government, while his son is president. And, in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day [some day??] benefit financially from his own administration's decisions, through his father's investments. The average American doesn't know that and, to me, that's a jaw-dropper.\" 64 The connections go on and on. Dallas attorney Robert Jordan, who defended George W. Bush against claims of insider trading and was appointed Bush's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, is a corporate lawyer in the Dallas office of Houston- based Baker Botts, lawyers to the Carlyle Group. The current \"Baker\" in Baker Botts is James A. Baker III, Father George's Secretary of State and a major player in the Carlyle Group. Baker Botts has an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the firm's client list includes \"more than half of the Fortune 100 companies\" and the Bush oil company Pennzoil. The former UK Prime Minister, John Major, was also hired as a European consultant to Carlyle and was made chairman for Carlyle Europe in May 2001. He has travelled with Bush promoting Carlyle interests. Major was Prime Minister when the BCCI scandal broke in 1991, just as Bush was president in the United States. Lord Howe, who was Deputy Prime Minister and Home Secretary in Major's government, also sits on Carlyle's European board. Howe made a crucial contribution to the removal from office of Margaret Thatcher when the Illuminati, via its Bilderberg Group, had decided she had become a liability because of her opposition to the European superstate. Other Carlyle directors and consultants include Fidel V. Ramos, the former Philippines President; Richard Darman, Father George's former Budget Director; Robert Grady, former assistant to Father George; Park Tae Joon, former Prime Minister of South Korea; Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Michael Orloff, former general director of the World Health Organization; J.H. Binford Peay, retired US Army General; John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff; Karl Otto Pohl, former president of Germany's Bundesbank; and Sami Baarma, director of Pakistan's Prime"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"86 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Commercial Bank in Lahore, which is owned by ... Khalid bin Mahfouz. Baarma (also Baarama) is a director of Lebanon's Credit Libanaise, which is owned by the Mahfouz family. This Carlyle line-up of global influence also involves the past or present chairmen of BMW.; drug giant Hoffman-LaRoche; Nestle; LVMH-Moet Hennessy; Louis Vuitton; and Aerospatiale, the French Airbus partner. Such connections have ensured massive growth for Carlyle. As the New York Times article noted of Father George's role: \"In getting business for Carlyle, Mr Bush has been impressive. His meeting with the crown prince [of Saudi Arabia] was followed by a yacht cruise and private dinners with Saudi officials, including King Fahd, all on behalf of Carlyle, which has extensive i nterests in the Middle East. \"And Mr Bush led Carlyle's successful entry into South Korea, the fastest-growing economy in Asia. After his meetings with the prime minister and other government and business leaders, Carlyle won a tough competition for control of KorAm, one of Korea's few healthy banks.\" The article goes on: \"In a new spin on Washington's revolving door between business and government, where lobbying by former officials is restricted but soliciting investments is not, Carlyle has upped the ante and taken the practice global. Mr Bush and Mr Baker were accompanied on their trips by former Prime Minister John Major of Britain, another of Carlyle's political stars. With door openers of this calibre, along with shrewd investment skills, Carlyle has gone from an unknown in the world of private equity to one of its biggest players. Private equity, which involves buying up companies in private deals and reselling them, is a high-end business open only to the very rich.\" 65 Carlyle and the bin Ladens The Washington-based Judicial Watch, a law firm that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, has highlighted the staggering fact, reported in the Wall Street journal, that Father George works for the bin Laden family through the Carlyle Group and has met with them at least twice in November 1998 and January 2000. Baker and Carlucci have also made the pilgrimage to the bin Laden family's headquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Father George issued a statement through his chief of staff, Jean Becker, to say he only recalled one meeting with the bin Laden family - in 1998 - but when Becker was read Bush's thank you note after another meeting with the bin Ladens, she suddenly confirmed they had in fact met twice. Yes, and the rest. This connection with the bin Ladens has continued while Osama bin Laden has been the world's most wanted man and the FBI, according to news reports, subpoenaed bin Laden family business records. However, Charles Freeman, president of the Middle East Policy Council and former US Ambassador to Saudi"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 87 Arabia, says that two of the bin Laden brothers have told him since September 11th that the FBI has been \"remarkably sensitive, tactful and protective\" of the family because of its \"long standing friendship with the US\". Another former US President, the Rockefeller-funded Jimmy Carter met with ten of Osama's brothers early in 2000 on a fundraising trip for the Carter Center in Atlanta.\" He met with Bakr bin Laden in New York in September 2000 and the bin Ladens handed over $200,000 to the Carter Center. Casper Weinberger, the former US Defense Secretary to Reagan-Bush who was charged over Iran-Contra and pardoned by Bush, is now the chairman of the New York publisher, Forbes Inc. He confirmed that Forbes executives and staff also made two visits to the bin Laden family headquarters in Jeddah. 6 ' The Carlyle Group, of course, is far from the only connection between the Bush and bin Laden families as we have seen, but this alone is outrageous in the circumstances. Larry Klayman, the chairman and general counsel of judicial Watch, said: \"This conflict of interest has now turned into a scandal. The idea of the President's father, an ex-president himself, doing business with a company under investigation by the FBI in the terror attacks of September 11 is horrible. President Bush should not ask, but demand, that his father pull out of the Carlyle Group.\" 68 But of course that didn't happen because both Bushes are up to their eyes in all this and Daddy calls the shots anyway. The Carlyle Group, clients to Osama bin Laden's family and associated with bin Laden funder Khalid bin Mahfouz, was one of the major financial supporters (together with Enron) of George W. Bush's run for the presidency! Wake me up. Looking after daddy The London Times reported an investigation into the illegal investment of public funds in the Carlyle Group through a web that leads back to George W. Bush. Reporter Tom Rhodes revealed the role of Wayne Berman, a former Assistant Secretary of Commerce in the Father George administration, who represents Carlyle. His company, Park Strategies, was involved in the transfer of $800 million in 1998 from the Connecticut state pension fund into private ventures and $50 million of this was placed in a Carlyle fund. As a result of this information, Berman, who denies any wrongdoing, resigned as a \"pioneer\", one of 400 elite supporters selected to raise money for Boy George's presidential campaign. Rhodes goes on to explain how Dubya was also connected to investment of public funds in Carlyle. A month after he became Texas Governor, he was given a campaign contribution of $25,000 from Thomas Hicks, a multi-millionaire who Bush later placed on the Board of Regents at the University of Texas along with Tom Loeffler, a former Republican congressman and Washington lobbyist for Hicks, and Don Evans, an oil company executive, close friend of Bush, and later his presidential campaign manager. With support from Bush, Hicks used his own investment company as the university's broker and formed a corporation called the University of Texas Management Company to invest the university's assets, totalling some $13 billion. Shortly afterwards, the Hicks-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"88 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. controlled, Bush-appointed and supported regents handed over $10 million to the Carlyle Group, which employs his father! When Don Evans released the names of the Dubya's \"pioneers\" at the heart of his record-breaking presidential fundraising campaign, they included Steven Hicks (the brother of Thomas Hicks), Tom Leoffler, Wayne Berman, three partners in Vinson and Elkins (the law firm that serves as counsel to the University of Texas Management Company), and two other men who benefited from Texas University investments. Oh yes, and the Texas teachers pension fund invested $100 million with Carlyle. The board that made this decision was appointed when George W. Bush was Texas Governor.\" What a cheek When you see all the connections between the Bushes and the Middle Eastern financial networks supporting people like Osama bin Laden, it is hard to even comprehend the level of pure, undiluted, bare-faced, hypocrisy that George W. Bush had to summon in the wake of September 11th when he told a White House news conference about his \"crackdown\" on those who do business with terrorists and the supporters of terrorists. He said in the White House Rose Garden on September 24th: \"US banks that have assets of these groups or individuals must freeze their accounts. And US citizens or businesses are prohibited from doing business with them.\" He said i t was \"a strike on the financial foundation of the global terror network. If you do business with terrorists, if you support or succour them, you will not do business with the United States.\" That applies to everyone it seems, except the Bush family, and their masters and cronies. I wonder what this means for the major British bank, Barclays plc, which is a \"core investor\" in a merchant bank set up on Guernsey in the Channel Islands in 1996 by Khalid bin Mahfouz, Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law? Barclays went into business with bin Mahfouz five years after he was involved in the world's biggest bank fraud, the BCCI. 7 ° Saudi Arabia, a 51st state (one of many) The endless connections between the Bushes, the Saudi Arabian royal family, elite Saudi business families, like the bin Ladens, and the terrorist networks, becomes understandable when you consider that Father George Bush, his masters and associates, control Saudi Arabia. Cathy O'Brien, a mind controlled slave to people like Father Bush and Dick Cheney for decades, saw at first hand what is really going on behind the smoke and mirrors. She writes in her book, Trance-Formation Of America: \"Saudi Arabia threaded in and out of most operations in which I was involved, primarily due to their purchase and routing of weapons, drugs, and blond-haired, blue-eyed programmed children. According to George Bush's claims, Saudi Arabia was in essence"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 89 a controlled financial arm of the United States. Saudi Arabian King Fahd and his Ambassador to the US, Prince Bandar, provided a front for the unconstitutional and criminal covert operations of the US. This included the arming of Iraq and the Nicaraguan Contras; US involvement in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI) scandal; and funding the Black Budget through purchase of our nation's children to be used as sex slaves and camel jockeys. \"Since the US 'won' control of the drug industries through the so-called Drug Wars, Saudi Arabia played an integral part in their distribution. It was my experience that Bush's claim of having Saudi Arabia King Fahd as his puppet was, in fact, reality.\" 71 Cathy also tells of how she was forced by Dick Cheney, then US Defense Secretary, to have sex with King Fahd, which, to a large extent, was part of the operation to blackmail him into total compliance, should he ever think of refusing an order. Who are the financial advisers to the Saudi royal family? The Carlyle Group. Who was their banker? Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder of Osama bin Laden. Are we to believe that the Bush family and their associates who have so much control over Saudi Arabia could not have caught Osama bin Laden years ago and destroyed the business networks close to King Fahd that have funded him and others? So why didn't they do it? Because they wanted that funding to happen and they wanted bin Laden to be built up into a global monster because it suited what they had planned in New York and Washington for September 11th 2001. Anthrax scares are good for business Oh yes, some more facts about the Carlyle Group. As a major defence contractor, it benefits massively from wars like those in Afghanistan and others in the \"war on terrorism\". According to the investigative journalist Sherman Skolnick, Carlyle owns a major slice of BioPort, the company that controls the US supply of the anthrax vaccine much used in the wake of September 11th when mysterious packages containing anthrax were posted to various addresses in America. The value of the vaccine soared after the packages began to appear and one of the major beneficiaries has been ... yes ... yes ... the bin Laden family - another investor in BioPort! 72 So, too, is Fuad El-Hibri, a Saudi businessman close to the bin Laden family, who is President and Chief Executive Officer of BioPort Corporation.\" You could not make this up. Another beneficiary is Admiral William Crowe, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when American-produced weapons-grade anthrax was being supplied to Saddam Hussein for use in the war against Iran. He served at the Pentagon for a time under Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, now chairman of the Carlyle Group. Admiral Crowe, a member of the Illuminati's Council on Foreign Relations and former US Ambassador to London, now owns 13% of BioPort Corporation and sits on the board. BioPort has one customer, the US Department of Defense, and one product - anthrax vaccine. It is the only US Corporation with a license to make anthrax vaccine and the licence was acquired in 1998 by buying the laboratory where the vaccine is made, the Michigan Biologic Products Institute."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. President Bush is not keen for the people to know the background to BioPort and its owners. Investigative reporter Sherman Skolnick writes: \"Under the disguise of invoking national emergency provisions, George W. Bush has ordered National Guard sentries to guard the BioPort facility in Lansing, Michigan. Bush has ordered, under pretext of 'national security', that employees and officials of BioPort are forbidden to discuss with reporters, commentators, and researchers, the nature of the ownership of BioPort Corporation. This was done to preclude details of this private corporation from being publicly disclosed. This presidential edict was quietly put through just prior to the beginning of bombing by the US of Afghanistan. Despite this clamp- down on disclosure, some very patriotic employees of BioPort have informed i ndependent-minded commentators of the reputed ownership and operations details of BioPort Corporation.\" \" BioPort's sole customer is the US Department of Defense, which has poured millions of dollars into the company to keep it going while it has supplied only 4% of the contracted vaccine. The Defense Department advanced $18 million of taxpayers' money in 1999 and another $24 million in 2000 and yet now the investors in the company, like the Bushes and bin Ladens, make fantastic profits because of the anthrax scare. Similarly, in 1996 when the Khobar Towers US military quarters in Saudi Arabia was hit by a terrorist truck bomb blamed on Osama bin Laden, his family business made a fortune with the contract from the US military to replace it and build military barracks and airfields for US troops! 75 The anthrax drug, Cipro, which increased its sales by 600% after October 2001, is produced by the German Illuminati company, Bayer, formerly part of I.G. Farben, the very heart of Hitler's war machine and the operation that ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Eberhard von Kuenheim, a former chairman of Bayer, works for the Carlyle Group. President George W. Bush has resisted all pressure to remove Bayer's patent and open the way for much cheaper generic versions, even though Bayer was apparently charging $350 for a drug you can buy in India for $10 to $20. \"Ken who?\" The Enron Corporation was the biggest financial backer of George W. Bush in his presidential election campaign and has been financially supporting his career since he was governor of Texas. You would, therefore, expect that it would be a cesspit of deceit and corruption. It was formed in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, and was based in the Bush home base of Houston, Texas. The following year Kenneth Lay, a member of the Illuminati Trilateral Commission, and close friend and associate of the Bushes, was made chief executive officer and later became chairman. Enron threw money like confetti at Bush and more than 250 senators and congressmen, and it bullied and manipulated a massive expansion of its global holdings helped by the nose-in-the-trough politicians on its payroll across the world. The technique was simple. The Illuminati forced the \"liberalisation\" and"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 91 \"opening up\" of national energy supplies in developing countries and elsewhere, and Enron then secured the contracts to supply energy in those countries, often funded by \"foreign aid\" and World Bank money. Everywhere they went, power prices soared at the expense of local people and, in California, they conspired with other power companies to create false \"shortages\" and blackouts to justify massive multi-billion-dollar investment by the state for increasing energy supply. However, Enron was using deeply corrupt accounting administered by the Arthur Andersen Group to hide its fantastic debts and exaggerate its earnings by hundreds of millions. Eventually, like its banking \"mirror\" the BCCI, the house of straw came down amid a frenzy of document shredding in December 2001 in the biggest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Those responsible, like chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeffrey Skilling, made multi-millions by selling their shares at the top of the market before, as they knew, the share price would collapse to the floor. Shareholders, including thousands of Enron employees who had been encouraged to buy shares by the company, lost everything, including, for thousands, their jobs. Kenneth Lay alone sold shares worth $119 million before the collapse and no wonder he could afford to donate $290,000 to the George W. Bush presidential campaign. Skilling sold some 10,000 shares a week to secure $66.9 million, and a group of 29 Enron executives and directors received $1.1 billion by selling 17.3 million shares between 1999 and mid-2001. They knew what was coming, but they cut and ran while thousands of workers and small shareholders lost billions and many their retirement pensions. Payback But right up to the end, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were trying to provide Kenny Boy with value for money. Lay served on the Bush transition team after his rigged November 2000 \"election\", and he helped to interview candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This oversees the gas pipelines and electricity grids that are fundamental to Enron's business! 76 Curtis Hebert, the chairman of the Commission, said he was \"offended\" by Lay's efforts to lobby for Enron and Hebert later resigned . 77 Enron executives were appointed to prominent positions in the Bush administration. Larry Lindsey, his Chief Economic Adviser, and Robert Zoellick, his leading trade negotiator, were both advisers to Enron and the Secretary of the Army, Thomas White, was an Enron executive before joining the Bush administration . 71 Karl Rove, Bush's senior adviser, was an Enron shareholder who took part in many government meetings about energy policy. In February and March 2000, soon after the Bush inauguration, Kenneth Lay met Vice President Cheney and energy policy was modified to suit Enron. In May, Cheney issued a statement opposing caps on energy prices in California after a memo from Lay suggesting that he do just that. In all, Lay and Enron were consulted six times before Cheney announced his energy policy. 79 Cheney has refused to make public the documents and details of what was discussed at these meetings or even allow access to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The White House \"energy task force\" was controlled by the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"92 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. energy industry and part of its final report involving the policy on global warming was taken almost word for word from a policy paper issued by an energy industry trade group.\"\" When the Enron scandal broke, of course, President Boy Bush did what the Bush family always do. He lied. He played down the relationship and referred to Lay as j ust a \"supporter\". Charles Lewis, Director of the Center of Public Integrity, said there was no doubt about the very close ties between Enron and Bush: \"Enron was the number one career patron for George W. Bush. There was no company in America closer to George W. Bush than Enron.\" \" Then in February 2002 some two dozen letters written by Lay to the then Governor Bush were released from Texas archives after requests by the media and the watchdog group, Public Citizen. They include holiday and birthday greetings and get well notes. In one letter sent in 1997, Bush says: \"Laura and I value our friendship with you.\" A note in the same year from Lay to Bush thanks him for his support for Enron's efforts to supply electricity for Philadelphia, then governed by Tom Ridge, who was appointed head of Homeland Security by Bush after 9 / 11. \"I very much appreciate your call to Tom Ridge a few days ago,\" Lay wrote, \"I am certain that it will have a positive impact on the way [Ridge] and others in Pennsylvania view our proposal.\" \"2 Bush first met Lay in the late 1980s and yet he said he only knew him after he became governor of Texas in 1994. Eventually White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett had to admit to the Chicago Tribune that the relationship between Bush and Lay probably began in 1987 and 1988 when they worked on Father Bush's presidential election campaign. \"He met him through his father and through his father's political activity,\" said Bartlett. \"He does not recall specifics.\"\" I bet he doesn't. Bush and Enron were one unit and both share a life-long addiction to deceit and corruption. Other \"Enron\"-type accounting scandals have followed with companies like Worldcom. This is, in part, a manifestation of the cesspit in which the global corporations operate, but it is also connected to the Illuminati plan to crash the world economy by destroying confidence in it. With the economy in ruins they would have a problem-reaction-solution to bring in their centralised control of everything. Incidentally, Richard Breeden, the man appointed court monitor of WorldCom after the accounting scandal broke, was the Father Bush-appointed Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission that cleared Boy George of insider trading with Harken Energy. Coup on America After Boy George's business failures in the oil industry, in which he massively benefited financially thanks to other people's money, he turned to baseball. He and a group of partners bought the franchise of the Texas Rangers in 1989. Bush was the general manager and this was part of the strategy designed to give him a positive profile in Texas with a view to him running for governor again. This he did with the money power behind him and he was elected Governor of Texas in November 1994, after which he became the most enthusiastic enforcer of capital punishment in America. The plan soon became clear - another Bush was being groomed for the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 93 presidency. He was re-elected governor on November 3rd 1998 with 68.6% of the vote. Two years later, almost to the day, he was the 43rd President of the United States, as I had predicted he would be some three years earlier. You only had to know his bloodline and see the way his political profile was being raised to realise that he was the chosen one. As a result, his presidential campaign broke all records for fundraising and, before June 2000, he had attracted donations of $37 million thanks to Enron, the Carlyle Group and the rest of the Illuminati campaign to put their man in the White House. His \"opponents\" were the Arizona Republican, John McCain, in the race for the Republican nomination for president, and the then Vice President Al Gore for the presidency itself. Both of these \"opponents\" knew they were not meant to win because Bush was the president-in-waiting. The Illuminati had enough dirt on both of them to stop any true expose of George W. Bush during the campaigns. Gore is also bloodline although his DNA connections are not as impressive as Bush's in the Illuminati genetic hierarchy. Again with Gore's insider knowledge of the Bush family he could have destroyed Dubya, but with Gore also heavily involved in the same horrific behaviour, and well aware of the dire consequences of crossing his masters, Bush was given an easy ride. In the same way, the Democratic \"challenger\" Michael Dukakis knew his role and his place when he faced Father George in the 1988 election before Bush gave way, as planned, to Clinton. But even with all the aces in his favour, George W. Bush was such an unimpressive candidate that Gore won the popular vote across the country by half a million in November 2000. In a truly representative election, that should have been enough to put Gore in the White House, but that wasn't the plan so it was not allowed to happen. The US system means that you win presidential \"points\" or votes for an \"electoral college\" based on the states you win (some states are worth more than others) and it all came down, infamously, to the result in Florida, the state governed by Bush's brother, Jeb, who, naturally being a Bush, is another monumental crook. Even though the vote in Florida was so obviously rigged (to anyone with any brain cell activity), note how meekly Al Gore accepted it in the end and slipped quietly away. He knew what had happened and he knew why, and he knew better than to cause trouble serious enough to stop Bush taking the throne. As Chicago investigative reporter, Sherman Skolnick, has pointed out, the Florida judiciary is notoriously controlled by the CIA,' which, in turn, is very closely associated with Father George, who had his own son, Jeb, running Florida during the \"election\". Sorry Al, darlin', you never stood a chance, mate. Not that he would have been any better had he won. A media consortium of the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, and CNN commissioned the National Opinion Research Council at Chicago University to inspect 170,000 disallowed votes in Florida to prove who really won the 2000 presidential election. The results were ready by the end of August 2001 and media reports suggested that the count would show that Gore beat Bush in Florida conclusively and should have been president. But after 9 / 11 the media consortium said that the recount had been postponed due to a \"lack of resources and lack of interest\" in the story after the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"94 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. events of September 11th.\" Oh yes? A lack of interest in whether you have a legitimate president when he is taking you into an open-ended war across the world? \"Our belief is that the priorities of the country have changed, and our priorities have changed,\" said Steven Goldstein, the Vice President of corporate communications at Dow Jones and Co, the owners of the Wall Street Journal.\" My belief is that the media priorities actually remain very much the same - suppressing information that doesn't suit those in power. Little things, you know, like the fact that the president is an impostor. What happened in Florida was a coup on America and yet the vast majority who watched it unfold had no idea that an unelected dictator had been imposed on their \"Land of the Free and Home of the Brave\" or, as someone rightly put it: \"The Land of the Fee and Home of the Slave.\" An investigation by the US Commission on Civil Rights reported that Florida officials (controlled ultimately by Governor Jeb Bush) had been responsible for preventing citizens from voting in the election. The report called this \"widespread\". The commission said the officials were \"grossly derelict\" in the way they conducted the election. Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, both Republicans, were especially highlighted in the Commission's report for ignoring \"mounting evidence\" of problems with outdated voting technology in a number of counties, and for ignoring requests for guidance and assistance from local elections officials. These \"technical problems\" were used as an excuse to discount tens of thousands of votes, mostly those of black and i mmigrant workers most likely to vote for Gore. Remember Bush eventually \"won\" the state by 537 votes. Yet in Palm Beach County, 19,000 ballots were \"double- punched\" and discarded, and in precincts heavily populated by Haitian-Americans, there were reports of ballots that were pre-punched for Bush. Tens of thousands of other people were told they could not vote at all, even though they were carrying voter registration cards. Palm Beach County was the location of a vote fraud in the late 1990s in which the Republican mayor was forced to resign because he had benefited from an absentee vote fraud organised by his supporters. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement arrested 58 people. Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry wrote: \"Florida's No 3 industry, behind tourism and skin cancer, is voter fraud. Here in Miami, we've had elections where the dead voters outnumbered the live ones. Elsewhere in the State there have been reports of irregular voting procedures, including one Palm Beach County precinct where the 'ballots' given to voters were actually pizza coupons.\" a' Bush buys the election BBC Newsnight reporter Greg Palast, a rare journalist worth the name, revealed that the Jeb Bush administration in Florida paid a private company called Database Technologies (DBT) $4 million to remove from the voter lists the names of people who had committed serious crimes.\" Palast obtained a document marked \"confidential and trade secret\", which says that the company was paid the money"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Born to be king \t 95 to make telephone calls to verify they got the right names. But they didn't do it. Palast said there was nothing in the State of Florida files that says these telephone calls were made and this wrongly barred thousands of Democrat voters who did not have criminal records from voting in Florida. The first list from DBT of voters they said should be barred from voting included 8,000 names supplied by George Bush's state officials in Texas! They claimed these names were all serious criminals barred from voting, but, as Palast said, it turned out that almost none were. When this was challenged, DBT issued a new list naming 58,000 felons, but one county that checked the names relevant to its voters found that this list was 95% wrong. One of those named, Reverend Willie Whiting, had never spent a night in jail in his life. Palast went to Tallahassee to question Jeb Bush's Director of Elections in Florida, Clayton Roberts. \"We want to know whether George W. Bush won the election or did brother Jeb steal it for him,\" Palast said. Roberts agreed to talk until he realised that Palast had a copy of the secret document relating to DBT and he called the State Troopers to remove Palast and his colleagues. Palast said that he had not asked his most difficult questions before the troopers arrived. These were: Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black Democrat voters before the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? In Palm Beach, voting machines misread 27,000 ballots, but Jeb Bush's Secretary of State, Katharine Harris, prevented these votes from being counted by hand. She did the same in Gadstone, one of Florida's poorest and most Democrat counties, where the machines did not count one in eight ballots. This same Katherine Harris was Co-Chair of the Bush presidential campaign! The illegitimate president The US Commission on Civil Rights confirmed that African-American voters were ten times more likely than white voters to have their ballots rejected and that an \"overzealous\" state-wide campaign to reduce voter fraud resulted in disproportionately denying eligible African-American voters from casting ballots on election day. It also said that African-Americans (overwhelmingly voters for Gore if you look at history) were more likely to have been erroneously removed from voter registration rolls than Hispanic or white voters. The report criticised local election supervisors in counties hardest hit by voting problems. It said they showed a \"lack of leadership\" in protecting voting rights. When the official count and recount using technology gave the election to Bush by a fraction, despite those thousands of votes lost to Gore, the Democrats called for a hand count. This was the only way to count the thousands of votes that were misread by voting machines. This was the only fair way to decide an election that was deciding the president. But the Bush camp was determined that this would not happen because they knew what the outcome of a fair count would be: Bush was going to lose. So on to the scene came ... oh yes, ladies and gentlemen please welcome ... James A. Baker III, the Secretary of State to Father George during the Gulf War, and a major force in the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"96 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. bin Laden/bin Mahfouz-connected Carlyle Group. Baker told the media in Tallahassee, Florida, that he and the Bush camp were applying for a federal injunction to stop a hand count. They were doing this, he said in typical Illuminati reverse language, to ... \"preserve the integrity and the consistency and the equality and finality of the most important civic action that Americans take: their votes in an election for president of the United States. We feel we have no other choice.\" R 9 No other choice if they wanted Bush to win. They also knew that if they could have the decision made by the Bush-controlled Supreme Court they were home. In the end, the issue did indeed go to the Supreme Court where, on December 12th 2000, they gave the presidency to Bush by five votes to four, voting on party lines. The decision was utterly perverse because they agreed that in order to have equal voter protection in Florida the whole state should be recounted, but they ruled that there was not enough time to do this - even though there were still weeks to go before the electoral votes of all the states had to be officially accepted.\"' On this insane basis they gave the presidency to Bush! This is how the man who has taken the world into a \"war on terrorism\" came to power. Another point about that Florida election. If you remember, the television networks that night first called Florida for Gore, then too close to call, and then for Bush. Well this is what happened. 91 In the early hours of election night, November 8th, the Fox News Channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, declared that Florida had gone for George W. Bush and that he was the new president. The other television networks repeated this within minutes. The man at Fox who recommended this decision was John Ellis, who headed the network's decision desk. Ellis, it turns out, is the first cousin of George W. Bush and brother Jeb, the Florida Governor, and, by his own admission, he had been in constant contact with them all night.\" Investigative reporter Kate Randall revealed: \"Shortly after 6 p.m. two waves of exit polls from the Voter News Service (a consortium set up by the major TV networks and Associated Press) showed the Florida vote going for Democratic candidate Al Gore. John Ellis received a call from the Bush campaign in Austin and told them the bad news. At 7.52 pm the major networks, including Fox, called Florida for Gore. \"Just after 8 pm, Jeb Bush phoned Ellis and asked him, 'Are you sure?', to which Ellis responded, `We're looking at a screen full of Gore.' It was at this point that the Bush campaign - aided by information to which they were privy via their family connection at Fox - went into overdrive to reverse what appeared to be a Democratic victory.\" 93 The Bush camp called a press conference at the Texas governor's mansion in Austin and said that, in their view, the vote was too close to call in Pennsylvania and Florida. The conference broke with previous election-night procedure in which candidates don't speak to the media until one of them has conceded. As Randall wrote:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Born to be king \t 97 \"The actions of the Bush campaign constituted a bald-faced attempt to co-opt a servile media into stampeding public opinion in its favor. The TV networks broadcast the i nterview even as large numbers of voters were still heading to the polls.\" 94 John Ellis, the Bush cousin at Fox, claims that exit polls by the Voter News Service showed a change in Florida in Bush's favour between 8pm and 9pm. After that, all the television networks withdrew the call for Gore and said Florida was too close to call. Newsweek reported that, after midnight, Bush's lead in Florida began to diminish, but despite this, at 2.16am, Fox News called Florida for Bush on the direction of Bush cousin, John Ellis. Again, within minutes, the other networks followed. Ellis told New Yorker magazine that 16 minutes before this decision he had been on the phone to the Bush brothers: \"It was just the three of us guys handing the phone back and forth - me with the numbers, one of them a governor, the other the president-elect. Now that was cool.\" Randall sums up this grotesque example of media bias: \"In other words, the Republican candidate, and the governor of the state where the outcome of the race would be determined, had a direct line - through their cousin - to a media outlet that would broadcast their 'victory' nationwide.\"\" With this announcement by Fox, Gore called Bush to concede the election and was about to make his speech giving the presidency to Bush when he heard that, in fact, Bush's lead (even with all those lost Gore votes) was down to a few thousand and falling. Randall quite rightly asks: \"Did Ellis, fearing that the networks might move Florida back into the Gore column, decide to make a pre-emptive strike in the hope of stampeding the other networks and conning Gore into making a premature concession? Did the Bush campaign have a hand in Ellis's call?\" It certainly helped Bush that's for sure. Mark Fabiani, Gore's communications director, said: \"To have a network like Fox call it and everybody follow suit was a tremendously damaging thing. It took literally 24 to 48 hours to convince people that Gore had won the popular vote.\" But, of course, Rupert Murdoch, supporter of Tony Blair in Britain, defended Ellis. No one who believes in fair play and media impartiality would do that, but this, it goes without saying, is not a problem for Murdoch. This is only a fraction of the horrific background to the Bush family that is taking the world further and further into a war against freedom, decency, and justice. Al Martin, a retired Lieutenant Commander with the US Naval Reserves and Naval Intelligence, is the author of The Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran-Contra Insider.\" Martin claims to have seen at first hand the government drug trafficking, illegal weapons deals and an \"epidemic of fraud\" - corporate securities fraud, real estate fraud, insurance fraud and bank fraud. He writes of the Bush family: \"You have to look at the entire Bush Family in this context - as if the entire family ran a corporation called Frauds-R-Us. Each member of the family, George Sr., George Jr., Neil, Jeb, Prescott, Wally, etc., have their own specialty of fraud. George Jr.'s speciality was i nsurance and security fraud.

It makes them feel at home, see. There are few better examples of this than their fellow Bohemian Grove attendee, Dick Cheney, the White House Chief of Staff to President Ford; Father George's Defense Secretary at the time of the Gulf conflict; and Vice President to George W. Bush during the \"war on terrorism\". Cathy O'Brien in her book, Trance-Formation Of America, tells of her horrific experiences of Cheney when she was a victim of the Illuminati/CIA mind-control programmes and Cheney was Defense Secretary to Father George, who sexually and violently abused her and her little daughter, Kelly. Cathy details in her book how she was involved in drug running operations under instructions from Cheney, some of which involved Bandar bin Sultan (Cheney called him \"the Sultan\"). Bin Sultan was the deeply corrupt US ambassador to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the George Bush puppet and close associate of the bin Laden family and terrorist financiers like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Cathy also describes the constant and sickening brutality that she and her daughter suffered from Cheney and Bush. This was just one occasion: \"Bush attempted to sell Cheney on the idea of pedophillia through graphic descriptions of having sex with Kelly. Both were already sexually aroused from drugs and anticipation. Cheney demonstrated to Bush why he did not have sex with kids by exposing himself to Kelly and saying: 'Come here.' Upon seeing Cheney's unusually large penis, Kelly reeled back in horror and cried `No!' which made them both laugh. Bush asked Cheney for his l i quid cocaine atomizer as he got up to take Kelly to the bedroom. When Cheney remarked how benevolent it was of Bush to numb her with it before sex, Bush replied: ` The hell it is. It's for me.' He described his excited state in typical vulgar terms and explained that he wanted to spray cocaine on his penis to last longer. \"Cheney said: `I thought it was for the kid'. 102"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 103 \"Bush explained: 'Half the fun is having them squirm.' He took Kelly's hand and led her off to the bedroom. \"Cheney told me that since I was responsible for Bush's assault on my daughter ... I would 'burn' (in hell). He burned my inner thigh with the fireplace poker and threatened to throw Kelly in the fire. He hypnotically enhanced his description of her burning to traumatize me deeply. As he sexually brutalized me, I heard Kelly's whimpers coming from the bedroom. As her cries grew louder, Cheney turned on classical music to drown out her cries for help.\"' Another time, Cathy tells of what happened when she asked Cheney, amid yet another brutal beating session, if she could go to the toilet: \"Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back i nto the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the carotid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled: 'If you don't mind, I will kill you. I could kill you - kill you - with my bare hands. You are not the first and you won't be the last. I'll kill you any time I goddam well please.' He flung me on the cot-type bed that was behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.\" 2 This is the same Dick Cheney who is US Vice President telling the world who we must bomb and slaughter to win the \"war on terrorism\". It is also worth noting the unbelievable hypocrisy involved when Boy George, the son of a paedophile and associate of Cheney, announced an initiative in August 2002 to \"protect America's children\". Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Nebraska in 1941 and was brought up in Casper, Wyoming. He is yet another of the clique to hail from Yale, home of the Skull and Bones Society, but he dropped out before eventually securing a degree in political science at Wyoming University. Cheney then headed for Washington where he joined the Nixon administration as a special assistant to ... Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary today in the \"war on terrorism\". Rumsfeld at that time was the first director of the Office of [Illuminati] Economic Opportunity. When Nixon resigned over the Kissinger-engineered Watergate scandal in 1974 (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free), Rumsfeld joined the White House staff as assistant to the new president, Gerald Ford, another abuser of Cathy O'Brien, and a man who, thanks to Watergate, never had to be elected and never would have been if the voters had been given a say. That was another coup on America. Ford's intellectual capacity was akin to that of George W. Bush and the famous saying that he couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time was right on. Cheney moved with Rumsfeld and eventually became Ford's Chief of Staff between 1975 and 1977 when he was still in his early thirties. After the first of several heart attacks, he was elected as Congressman for Wyoming and remained in office until Father George made him Defense Secretary when he was elected president in 1988. Cheney is yet another of the bloodline cliques which are keen to send others into battle, so long as they never"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"104 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. have to go. He also avoided the draft to Vietnam when he was given deferments because he was a student and a \"registrant with a child\". Just like President \"Dubya\", he told his Senate confirmation hearing that he \"would have been obviously happy to serve had I been called\". Funny how they never are, though. In 1964, Cheney married his wife, Lynne, another Washington insider. She was head of the National Endowment of the Humanities from 1986 to 1993 under Reagan and then Bush (or, in truth, Bush and then Bush). She later became a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (where Cheney was also involved between 1993 and 1995) and was co-host of CNN's appalling \"debate\" show Crossfire Sunday for three years until 1998. Mrs Cheney was on the Lockheed Martin board from 1994 until January 2001 - the very company that the then Texas Governor George W. Bush tried to contract to run the Texas welfare system. Fortunately, public protests stopped him. Bruce Jackson, the Lockheed Martin Vice President, was a finance chair of the Bush for President campaign. Dick Cheney became best known during the Gulf Slaughter in 1991 when he worked to ensure the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, now more than a million when you include the sanctions. Alongside him in that administration were President Father George (Carlyle Group), Secretary of State James Baker (Carlyle Group) and Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cheney stated that his \"defence\" policy was \"Arms for America's friends and arms control for its potential foes.\" Which, of course, was baloney. The policy was \"Sell second-rate arms to countries that we can then demonise for being armed and dangerous, thus giving us the excuse to use our state-of-the-art weapons to blow the shit out of their civilian population.\" Big Dick and big business After Bush's pre-arranged defeat to his subordinate associate Bill Clinton in 1992, Cheney moved into \"private business\" to serve the Illuminati in another way pending his return to Washington with Little George nine years later. Cheney became fantastically wealthy as a director of elite companies like Morgan Stanley, Union Pacific, Procter & Gamble, and Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems Corporation. His most important appointment, however, came in 1995 when he became the Chairman and Chief Executive of the (yet again) Texas-based Halliburton Oil. This was founded in 1919 and owns a highly significant subsidiary called Brown & Root. Cheney had no experience in the oil industry, but that's not why Halliburton offered him the job. He had other \"qualities\" that would expand their business. While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and before and afterwards), Brown & Root has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of construction contracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti after they had been devastated by US bombing and manipulation. In the same way, in July 1999, a Balkan Assistance and Reconstruction Conference in Washington DC was arranged for Balkan government officials to meet with executives from Cheney's Halliburton/Brown & Root and other US corporations to plan the financial and political needs for the occupation and operation of the Balkans. The technique is"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 105 this: you control the political decisions to start wars that suit your agenda; you lend the governments money to buy armaments from you and they use your oil to fight the wars; then, when all this has devastated the target country and its population, you get yourself awarded the contracts to rebuild what you have destroyed. Cheney is the biggest shareholder in Halliburton with a stake of some $45.5 million and the company's board includes Lawrence Eagleburger, who held State Department posts under President Father George and is an executive of the notorious Kissinger Associates (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Paying for the privilege Halliburton and Brown & Root have long used political patronage and funding to expand business and profits. Brown & Root's ticket to the top came through its political contributions to President Lyndon Johnson from the time he ran for Senate in 1948. The Austin Chronicle once called him \"the candidate from Brown and Root\"' Thanks to Johnson they made billions on government contracts, including those relating to the Vietnam War after Johnson reversed the policies of the assassinated JFK and plunged America deeper into the conflict. During Vietnam, Johnson gave his personal funders contracts for airports, pipelines and military bases.' According to biographer Ronnie Dugger, author of The Politician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,' much of the money he was paid by Brown & Root came in cash. \"It was a totally corrupt relationship and it benefited both of them enormously,\" says Dugger, \"Brown & Root got rich, and Johnson got power and riches.\" Using the same tactics, the contracts have flowed from government ever since. Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles police officer, wrote in a study of Brown & Root: \"From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya, to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to Laos, to Vietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to Libya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown & Root's traditional operations have expanded from heavy construction to include the provision of l ogistical support for the US military. Now, instead of US Army quartermasters, the world is likely to see Brown & Root warehouses storing and managing everything from uniforms to rations to vehicles.\" 6 Both Halliburton and Brown & Root were funders of a now infamous company called Permindex, a British Intelligence front organisation headed by the Canadian Louis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now well documented, was the central coordinating network behind the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas (Texas again) in 1963. (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background.) Permindex also ran death squads in Europe, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and the United States. Clay Shaw is the only man to be tried for involvement in the assassination, but the New Orleans District Attorney, Ji m Garrison, failed to secure a conviction because the key prosecution witnesses had this strange habit of dying from less than natural causes. Shaw, a British intelligence operative who worked for Churchill during the Second World War, ran a division of Permindex in New Orleans. After the assassination, Halliburton"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"106 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. purchased Brown & Root. The connections from Permindex involved a stream of famous companies, banks and personalities, including the Bush family and the Bronfman gangster family in Canada through its Seagram liquor operation.' Halliburton, at Cheney's say-so, bought and merged with Dresser Industries in an $8 billion deal in 1998 to create the biggest oil-drilling services company in the world. George W. Bush's grandfather Prescott Bush was on the board of Dresser Industries for 22 years in his capacity as a partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman, the funders of Hitler and the eugenics movement, which owned Dresser. The President and Chairman of the Dresser board was Henry Neil Mallon, Prescott's Skull and Bones buddy, who was among those involved in raiding the grave of the Apache chief Geronimo at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1918 to steal his skull and take it back to Skull and Bones headquarters at Yale. It was Mallon, apparently, who burned the flesh and hair off the skull after Bush and friends had stolen it. Father George's crooked son, Neil Mallon Bush of Silverado Savings and Loans fame, was named after the Dresser President, and Father George began his oil career with the company. There is, researchers suggest, a photograph that includes Prescott Bush, and George and Barbara Bush holding an infant George W. in front of the Dresser Industries executive plane.' Snouts in the trough Cheney says he stands for small government and against government handouts. What he means, naturally, is he believes in that for everyone else, not himself. Halliburton received in five years some $4 billion (at least) in government contracts and loans insured by the taxpayer. The government, through the US Export-Import Bank, also guaranteed credits worth $489 million to a Russian oil company to the benefit of Halliburton, through Brown & Root. This company, according to Russian and American sources and documents, is connected to drug trafficking and organised crime.' Before Cheney took over at Halliburton, its business with the US Defense Department was worth around $300 million a year. When Cheney, the former Defense Secretary, arrived their government contracts soared to more than $650 million, according to the Baltimore Sun.\" It's the same story with loans and guarantees from the government's Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation: $100 million in the five years before Cheney, but at least $1.5 billion under his leadership. In return for political support and loan guarantees, Halliburton donated vast sums to political candidates and parties after Cheney's arrival, and the lobbying budget doubled: $300,000 a year on lobbying politicians before Cheney and $600,000 with him at the helm. Halliburton has also benefited. from US \"aid\" to various countries, which was then spent by the recipients on hiring Halliburton. The Los Angeles Times obtained State Department documents that showed how government officials helped Halliburton to win major contracts in Asia and Africa.\" This is the way the Illuminati families and agents operate. They control the government decisions through the Illuminati one-party state and operate companies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, which benefit from those government decisions and policies. This is how, once Cheney took over, Halliburton"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 107 was able to expand so rapidly and become the fifth largest defence contractor in the US, so benefiting enormously from conflicts like the \"war on terrorism\". It has a worldwide operation involving 130 countries and is America's biggest non-union company.\" No wonder Cheney was given a $34 million \"retirement package\" when he left in the summer of 2000 to be the running mate of Boy George. This was after five years on a salary of $1.3 million a year, plus bonuses of millions more, stock options worth some $45 million,\" and his sale of 100,000 Halliburton shares that netted him $5.1 million. 14 The \"retirement package\" also included 400,000 unvested stock options due to \"vest\" over three years. This means that the higher the value of Halliburton stock in this period the more money the Vice President will accrue, and the oil industry depends very much on government policy. The Baltimore Sun of June 10th 2002 reported that Halliburton was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities. An \"aggressive accounting practice\" at Halliburton approved by the (Enron/Worldcom) accounting firm Arthur Andersen was said to be behind the investigation, and involved allegations of counting $100 million in revenue that had not yet been received. Working with terrorists Cheney's Halliburton has worked closely with some of the most appalling terrorist dictatorships on the planet. He talks of \"constructive engagement\" in which you work with such regimes and pass on American values. No need. The values of successive US and British governments are a mirror of those employed by these very terrorist dictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with \"values\" - he doesn't have any - it is about working with anyone at any price to ensure more money and power, and the advancement of the Illuminati agenda. Dick Cheney was the Defense Secretary in the Gulf Slaughter supposedly aimed at Saddam Hussein in 1991. Yet he made big profits for himself and Halliburton after 1998 through deals with ... Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The London Financial Times reported that Cheney oversaw $23.8 million worth of contracts for the sale of \"oil industry\" technology and services to Iraq. He used Halliburton subsidiaries in France, Italy, Germany and Austria to hide the Cheney-Halliburton connection. Among these companies were Dresser Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump.\" These contracts together were worth more than any other US company doing business with Iraq. The International Herald Tribune reported that \"Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Co., joint ventures that Halliburton has sold ... have done work in Iraq on contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, under the United Nations' Oil for Food Program.\" 16 A Halliburton spokesman admitted in the Tribune article that the Dresser subsidiaries had sold oil-pumping equipment to Iraq via their European agents. So get this: staggeringly, these Halliburton group contracts were helping to rebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq destroyed by the bombs dropped by United States planes commanded from the Pentagon by the then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney! At the same time Cheney was supporting sanctions against Iraq that have so far produced around a million dead children. (What happened there to \"constructive engagement\"?)"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"108 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. The oil cartel benefits enormously from cheap oil pumped by Iraq in the United Nations' (Illuminati) \"oil-for-food programme\". Many Illuminati companies and front men are benefiting from contracts with Iraq and other brutal dictatorships while supporting sanctions that are killing thousands of Iraqi children every month. John Deutsch, the former head of the CIA, is a director of Schlumberger, the second largest US oil services company, which also does business, through subsidiaries, with Iraq. Halliburton has struck deals in Iran and Libya, even though they were on the State Department's list of terrorist states. The Halliburton subsidiary Brown & Root was fined $3.8 million for violation of US sanctions against Libya. Cheney, incidentally, lied on US television (it comes so easy to him) when he was asked during the 2000 presidential campaign on ABC's This Week programme about Halliburton's deals with Iraq while he was in charge. He had this brief exchange with interviewer Sam Donaldson, who then just let the matter drop: Donaldson: \"I'm told, and correct me if I'm wrong, that Halliburton, through subsidiaries, was actually trying to do business in Iraq?\" Cheney: \"No. No. I had a firm policy that I wouldn't do anything in Iraq - even arrangements that were supposedly legal.\" What's that they say? Liar, liar, pants on fire? The Gore camp didn't raise this explosive information because they were up to their eyes in corruption too. Anything goes A number of pressure groups have sought to expose the support by Halliburton under Cheney's leadership of the brutal military dictatorship in Burma through their involvement in pipeline construction. Among Halliburton's partners, according to published reports, has been the British company Alfred McAlpine. Readers of my other books, like The Biggest Secret, will need no introduction to the McAlpine family. EarthRights, the human rights group based in Washington DC, condemned Cheney's Halliburton for two pipeline projects in Burma, the building of which led to rape, murder, indentured labour, the forced relocation of villages and other crimes against humanity.\" The regime in Burma (also known as Myanmar) has been condemned constantly by the U.N. General Assembly, the International Labor Organization, Amnesty International, the European Union and the US government, which withdrew its ambassador and imposed sanctions. Funnily enough, these sanctions laws specifically exempt the work that Halliburton does. Katie Redford, a human rights lawyer for EarthRights, said: \"Halliburton partners and subsidiaries, both before and during Dick Cheney's tenure as CEO, have been contractors for pipeline projects that have led to crimes against humanity in Burma.\" 18 The International Labor Organization said the junta in Burma is guilty of \"an international crime\", possibly \"a crime against humanity\", through its exploitation of forced child labour. Tens of thousands of people have been abused, murdered and driven from their homelands by the Burmese army, thousands have"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 109 been tortured, and the jails are full of political prisoners. The junta is also one of the world's major producers and traffickers of heroin. All this matters not a jot to Dick Cheney. In fact to him it will be all the more reason to get involved. Also working with the Burmese terrorists on the oil pipelines has been Unocal (Union Oil of California) - the company that proposed a pipeline across Afghanistan, but said the Taliban had to go before it could happen. Cheney sought to overcome any obstacles to his company's business dealings with one of the world's most oppressive regimes by using USA-Engage, the lobbying group that opposed investment sanctions against Burma. He was also on the board of the National Foreign Trade Council that helped to pressure the Supreme Court to overturn a Massachusetts state law that imposed penalties on companies trading with Burma. When it suits Cheney's agenda he is against even financial sanctions against an oppressive terrorist regime. When it suits him another way, he is in favour of blitz bombing the country and killing thousands of civilians, as in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" Halliburton has both denied involvement in Burma and said that it has not tried to hide its involvement. Go figure. Wall Street Journal reporter Peter Waldman points out that when Halliburton proclaimed its \"success story\" in December 1996 with a press conference to announce several big contracts in Asia and Europe there was no mention of one of their biggest deals of the year - in Burma.\" A spokeswoman for Halliburton said she was not able to establish why the company failed to mention the Burma contract for its subsidiary, European Marine. I think I can help her there. She also declined to explain the massive revenue increase - some 77% - for European Marine in 1997, the year that most of the Burma work was done. I'm sure I can be of some assistance to her there, too. The Halliburton contract was mostly for work on the pipeline offshore and the company claimed that it had no dealings with the Burmese people or the military. This is simply not true. A 1996 report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Burma, Judge Rajsoomer Lallah of Mauritius, revealed that people were forced to work offshore as well. He found that in 1995 the military ordered about 200 villagers to go to Heinze Island, an uninhabited shoal in the Andaman Sea where Burmese forces set up a base camp to guard construction work on the offshore pipeline. Peter Waldman told the story in his Wall Street Journal report: \"On Heinze Island, Judge Lallah found, the villagers were required to work for two weeks without pay, clearing land, building bamboo barracks and constructing a helicopter pad high atop a steep hill - probably for later use by the Western companies that built the pipeline, according to Burmese human-rights monitors. The villagers were forced to pay their own transportation costs to the island; those who refused to go were arrested and sent into rebellious areas to serve as porters for the military, Judge Lallah wrote.\" 21 ... and there's more Burma is only one in a long list of Cheney-Halliburton deals with dubious and terrorist regimes. Human rights activists point to Halliburton's role in Algeria, Angola, Bosnia, Croatia, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Rwanda, Somalia, Indonesia, Libya and"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"110 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

EarthRights revealed that a Halliburton contract with Indonesia was cancelled by the government when they investigated those that had been corruptly awarded. One corporate watchdog organisation in Indonesia said that Halliburtori s engineering division, Kellogg Brown & Root, was among 59 companies that used \"collusive, corruptive and nepotistic practices\" with the family of the former president Suharto, a vicious and corrupt dictator installed by British and American intelligence to serve the interests of the corporate giants owned by the Illuminati. 22 That's why Indonesia is now one of the sweatshop capitals of the world where people living in abject poverty work a fantastic number of hours a week for pitiful pay so that big-name clothing and sportswear companies can accrue staggering profits by making the products there for next to nothing while selling them for high prices in the West. It's called \"globalisation\" and \"free trade\". In Nigeria, Halliburton worked with Shell and Chevron, which were both i mplicated in gross violations of human rights and the environment. (British Petroleum, Esso, Du Pont, ERAP, Texaco, and Total also have interests in Nigeria.) Cheney's firm increased its involvement there after the military dictatorship executed several environmental activists and violently prevented protests against the oil industry. Halliburton was accused of complicity in the shooting of a protestor by Nigeria's Mobile Police Unit. In another incident, highlighted by the New York-based pressure group, Human Rights Watch, soldiers using a Chevron helicopter and Chevron boats attacked villagers in two small communities in Delta State, Opia and Ikenyan. They killed at least four people and burned most of the villages to the ground. More than 50 people were still missing, Human Rights Watch reported. Chevron, who merged with Texaco a month after 9/11, claimed it was a \"counterattack\" resulting from a confrontation between local youths and soldiers at a Chevron drilling rig. Community members denied there was any such confrontation. Condoleeza Rice, the current US National Security Adviser to Bush and Cheney, was a director of Chevron from 1991 and she took charge of public policy for the board. She even had a Chevron oil tanker named after her. Rice was involved in negotiating Chevron investments in the vast untapped reserves of oil in the Caspian Sea region before leaving to join her long-time buddy, George W. Bush. As National Security Adviser she is very much involved in the \"war on terrorism\", which has removed the Taliban regime and opened the way for oil and gas pipelines across Afghanistan. These are the very pipelines designed to tap the vast gas and oil reserves around ... the Caspian Sea. It's the oil, stupid Before we can understand one (of many) reasons for September 11th and the \"war on terrorism\" we have to understand the plans of the Illuminati with regard to the fantastic oil and gas reserves of the Caspian Sea region.

The San Francisco Chronicle estimated the proven and projected reserves in the region to be more than 800 billion barrels of crude petroleum and its equivalent in natural gas.\" The combined oil reserves in the Americas and Europe are reckoned to be fewer than 160 billion barrels. The biggest Caspian fields are in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (both in Halliburton's portfolio, and Cheney sat on the state of Kazakhstan's Oil Advisory Board). Lesser reserves are located in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia. The projected value of this, based on average prices in the 1990s, is $5 trillion, a very conservative estimate. This is the region in which the United States is locating troops in the name of the \"war on terrorism\". The real reason is to secure control of the oil and gas reserves and the pipelines that will take them to market. William Ramsay, a US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Energy, Sanctions and Commodities, said that Caspian oil is \"crucial to the world energy balance over the next 25 years.\" He also revealed that: \"... there already exists a kind of outline of a new Silk Road running through the Caucasus and beyond the Caspian. We think oil and gas pipelines, roads, railways and fiber optics can make this 21st century Silk Road a superhighway linking Europe and Central Asia.\" 2, The manufactured wars in the Balkans that have caused so much death and suffering, were also engineered, in part, for this same reason - oil"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"112 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Doug Bereuter, Chairman of the US House [of Representatives] Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific, confirmed that American policy goals in this region are the \"independence\" of the new states and their ties to the West (yeah, right), breaking Russia's monopoly over oil and gas transport routes, encouraging the construction of East-West pipelines that do not transit Iran, and denying Iran dangerous leverage over the central Asian economies.\" Researcher George Draffan wrote in an article on the battle for Caspian oil: \"The 1995 Dayton Accords led to a major NATO military operation to `pacify' Bosnia- Herzegovina. For the multinational corporations working alongside NATO, one of the most important rewards will be the construction of a trans-Balkan pipeline to bring oil from the Caspian Sea region to Europe. \"The European Union, the US government, and a gang of multinational corporations (including BP, Amoco, Exxon, Unocal, Caterpillar, Halliburton/Brown & Root, and Mitsubishi) are using all the military, political, and economic tools at their disposal to destroy and recreate the infrastructure and economy of south-eastern Europe in their own image. The conflicts of interest between government officials and corporate executives are blatant and revealing. \"Recent NATO military action in Yugoslavia is part of a long strategic (economic) battle to control the Balkans. The current focus is to secure oil and gas pipeline routes from the oilfields of the Caspian Sea to the consumers of Europe. Multinational oil corporations from the US, Britain and other European countries, and Russia are signing multibillion-dollar contracts with Kazakhstan.\" 27 This includes Cheney's Halliburton and, incidentally, all the US Army camps in Bosnia for the \"peacekeeping\" operations are built and run by Halliburton's major subsidiary Brown & Root. War is so great for business. Condoleezza Rice's ChevronTexaco is leading a Caspian Pipeline Consortium developing Caspian- Kazakhstan oil deposits. Others in the trough are BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobil and Unocal. They are seeking to access these reserves from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, the three countries that surround the Caspian together with Russia and Iran. The Russians want a pipeline north from the Caspian into their territory to the Black Sea. Russian military action, claimed by President Putin to be a response to Chechnya and al-Qaeda terrorism, has \"coincidentally\" taken place near the projected routes of the pipelines. Putin is a \"former\" KGB operative and head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and anything he says should be disbelieved by reflex action. When you look at the frenzy to control and access these oil and gas reserves, the pattern of conflict and terrorism across this whole Middle East and Caspian region starts to make coordinated sense. Author Michael Griffin wrote in Reaping the Whirlwind\" that the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan can be linked to a \"single, golden theme\", which he identified in places like Chechnya, Nagorno- Karabakh, Abkhazia and Turkish Kurdistan:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 11 3 ... \"each represented a distinct, tactical move, crucial at the time, in discerning which power would ultimately become master of the pipelines which, some time in this century, will transport the oil and gas from the Caspian basin to an energy-avid world.\" 29 Different place, same names The oil cartel and its political cronies and associates are working together to maximise their power and profits. One example is the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), which is a consortium involving the country's state oil company together with Pennzoil (Bush), Unocal, Exxon, British corporations BP- Amoco and Ramco Khazar, Lukoil (Russia), Den Norske Stats Olieseiscap ( Norway), Turkie Petrollari (Turkey), Itochu (Japan) and Delta Nimir Khazar (Saudi Arabia). Note that Pennzoil, a major player in the project, was created when Father George Bush's Zapata Oil took over Penn Oil in 1963. Baker and Botts, the law firm now headed by James Baker, Bush's Carlyle Group associate, handle Pennzoil's legal affairs. Thomas Petzinger, a business journalist on the Wall Street Journal, would later write: \"For 25 years, the internal legal department at Pennzoil had been almost indistinguishable from Baker and Botts.\" 30 Pennzoil's partner in the project, Delta Nimir, is controlled by our old friends Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi and Khalid bin Mahfouz, both of whom have financial ties to \"Osama bin Laden's\" al- Qaeda. Bin Mahfouz has funded George W. Bush's oil company and the Carlyle Group of Father George. Other business partnerships involving bin Mahfouz, Al- Amoudi, and leading US oil giants include the following: the Nimir Petroleum ( Mahfouz family) deal with ChevronTexaco to develop massive oil fields in Kazakhstan that are said to contain up to 1.5 billion barrels of oil; the Delta Oil (Al- Amoudi family) partnership with Amerada Hess to develop oil fields in Azerbaijan; and Delta-Hess is part of a consortium hoping to build a $2.4 billion oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey. One of the directors of the US and Saudi-dominated Azerbaijan International Operating Company is Brent Scowcroft, a former US National Security Adviser, an executive of Kissinger Associates, and a very close associate of Father George Bush. The plans of this consortium involve a thousand-mile pipeline from Baku on the Caspian across Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean, which was projected to cost $3 billion. Oil is a main reason (along with drugs) for the Turkish and other attacks on the lands of the Kurds and the massive expansion of the Turkish armed forces. Turkey has already murdered thousands of Kurds, destroyed thousands of villages and produced millions of refugees. The horrors of September 11th have provided the excuse for both British and American forces to be dispatched to the very region necessary to secure control of the Caspian oil reserves and pipeline projects and for enormous increases in spending on \"defence\" and \"security\". As I was writing this chapter, President Bush announced a $48 billion increase in US defence spending to $379 billion and said he would spend whatever it takes to keep the American people safe. What's that about there being no money for the poor and hungry? These vast increases"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"114 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

Trading with terror Azerbaijan, like the other oil-rich or pipeline-significant countries in the Caspian, has an appalling human rights record. Ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno- Karabakh, a mountainous region of Azerbaijan, has led to sanctions and restrictions on US aid to the country. This was made law through section 907 of the 1992 Freedom Support Act. Cheney has pressed for the repeal of this section to release funds for the oil cartel's operations in Azerbaijan and has lobbied constantly for sanctions to be lifted on Iran and other countries to ease through the Illuminati oil agenda he represents. He is also among those lobbying for the Azerbaijan-Turkey pipeline on behalf of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company. His fellow lobbyists include James Baker, Father George's Secretary of State, oil company lawyer, and director of the Carlyle Group; Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter and founder of the Illuminati's Trilateral Commission; Lloyd Bentsen, former US Secretary of the Treasury; John Sununu, former White House Chief of Staff to George Bush; Tim Eggar, the former British Energy Minister and now CEO of Britain's Monument Oil; Malcolm Rifkind, the former British Foreign Secretary and now a director of the British oil corporation, Ramco; oh yes, and Richard Secord, the former US Air Force Major General charged for his part in Father George's Iran-Contra affair, has been helping to train the Azerbaijani army. By 1997, Pennzoil, Unocal, Amoco and Exxon had invested $5 billion in Azerbaijan and, as we have seen so many times, forcibly controlling the population to ensure unchallenged control for the oil cartel is a constant strategy. Compliant dictatorships are good for business and I include \"democracies\" in that also. The Azerbaijan government is now serving the interests of this American and British takeover of the Caspian region by selling off ports, railroads, the national airline, airports and other state-run enterprises to \"foreign investors\". It is an identical story in the Balkans where the same thing is happening. Governments are installed after manipulated wars that will sell off major state assets to the Illuminati corporations and award contracts to their companies for \"reconstruction\". Contracts for the Balkan region, are estimated to be worth 30 billion. Then there is the money (taxpayers money) paid out for \"reconstruction\" and \"aid\" by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both of which are 100% Illuminati (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Most of this money also ends up with the corporations and this is why the projects funded by this diabolical duo are designed to benefit business interests and not local populations. NATO, the world army in all but name, is nothing more than the means for the Illuminati cartels to bully and bomb their targets into submission so this process can unfold - that's the real reason for the Balkan occupation by foreign troops. This strategy was promoted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the founder of the Trilateral Commission and major Illuminati insider, in his 1997 book The Grand Chessboard. He"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 115 said that control of Uzbekistan was the key to dominating the region and its oil and gas reserves. This is why the US has had \"military advisers\" in Uzbekistan for a long time and this \"support\" has been increased still further in the \"war on terrorism\". Writing of the need for the United States to dominate the region, Brzezinski says: \"The three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.\" 31 I think divide and rule would put it more succinctly. An article by writer Nicholas Lemann in the New Yorker also revealed that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 Dick Cheney formed a group to plan a strategy for the 1990s and beyond.\" This group included the current Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the current Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, the current Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, currently Cheney's chief of staff. The aim was to \"shape\" the world in their desired image or, as another member, Zalmay Khalilzad, put it ... to \"preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future\". Lemann says he was shown a copy of the document Cheney's group put together called Defense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy, Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, January 1993. This was the month that Bill Clinton was inaugurated, and Cheney and Father Bush left the White House. This \"strategy\", planned in the early 1990s, is pretty much what the Bush and Cheney government is doing today - a government that includes the key people who put the document together. The \"war on terrorism\" was a response to September 11th? Ha, ha, ha. Whoop, whoop, whoop. It's the way they tell 'em. So why Afghanistan? All of this brings me to Afghanistan and the Texas-based oil giant Unocal, one of the world's leading independent natural gas and crude oil exploration and production companies. It has been a project-partner many times with Cheney's Texas-based Halliburton. The Burma pipeline is one example of this and as Cheney said in his 1998 speech to the \"Collateral Damage Conference\" presented by the Washington \"think tank\", the Cato Institute: \"About 70 to 75% of our business is energy related, serving customers like Unocal, Exxon, Shell, Chevron and many other major oil companies around the world.\" Both Halliburton and Unocal have business and crony connections to the Bush family, as indeed do Chevron, Shell, and Exxon come to that. In October 1997, Unocal led an international consortium that beat off competition from the Argentine company, Bridas, to sign a $2 billion contract with Turkmenistan for the CentGas project (Central Asia Gas), a massive pipeline that included 750 metres across western Afghanistan. It would connect the vast natural gas reserves of Turkmenistan (possibly the world's biggest) to a plant and ports on the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan - yet another military dictatorship controlled by the \"West\" (Illuminati). An oil version was also planned and extensions into India were being considered. How fascinating that in that same month, on October 27th 1997, a press release from Cheney's Halliburton announced that the company had received a Letter of Intent from Petronas Carigali (Turkmenistan) to provide"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"116 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

Figure 9: The approximate route of the pipelines planned across Afghanistan to carry oil and gas to world markets integrated drilling services worth an initial $30 million for an exploration and appraisal programme in the Caspian Sea beginning in late 1997. It went on: \"Halliburton, in conjunction with alliance partners, Dresser Industries and Western Atlas, will provide a combination of 10 services ... Halliburton will be the lead contractor and project manager in addition to providing technical services. The value of the award is estimated to be US $30 million for the total project.\" This no doubt was Halliburton's contribution to the Unocal pipeline across Afghanistan (Figure 9). Taliban we love you Turkmenistan's dictator President Niyazov said he had a promise of support for the pipeline from both the ruling Taliban and from anti-Taliban factions in Afghanistan. Turkmenistan's official negotiator on the pipeline project was Yosef Maiman, a \"former\" agent with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, which, at the highest level, is the same organisation as the CIA, British intelligence, and so on. The Taliban were keen to go ahead because it would net them some $100 million a year, but to make the project work Unocal needed the US State Department to formally recognise the Taliban government that had seized power with it's usual extreme violence in 1996 from the factions of the Mujahadin that had fought, with CIA support, to remove the Soviet Union from the country. The Taliban killed and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 117 castrated the former president Najibullah, and hung his body and that of his brother from traffic lights at the entrance to the Presidential Palace. In September 1996, a day after the Taliban took power in Kabul, a US State Department spokesman, Glyn Davies, said that the United States saw \"nothing objectionable\" in the Taliban inflicting its strict interpretation of Islamic law. Unocal and partners hired some big names to press the case for a deal with the Taliban. Among them were Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and one of the major Illuminati manipulators of the past 40 years; Robert Oakley, the US Ambassador to Pakistan during the Reagan and Bush administrations; and the Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, a former adviser on Afghanistan in the Reagan (Bush) State Department. This is the same man appointed by President George W. Bush as Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Khalilzad is a former adviser to Unocal on the pipeline project! The journalist and cartoonist, Ted Rall, says that Khalilzad worked for the Reagan Administration in arming the CIA-funded Mujahadin during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. This was the period when the Osama bin Laden network was formed with American government money and it eventually led to the coming to power of the Taliban. Khalilzad was also part of Dick Cheney's \"strategy group\" in the early 1990s and argued that it was \"vital\" to prevent a rival to the United States' supremacy from emerging and \"to be willing to use force if necessary. \"33 When the Taliban were removed by the \"war on terrorism\" following 9/11, the head of the new government in Afghanistan was named as Hamid Karzai who, according to the French publication Le Monde, is a former consultant to ... yes ... Unocal.' Robert Oakley was also Ambassador to Somalia and Zaire, a head of \"counterterrorism\" for Reagan and Bush, and one of the US government officials ensuring that CIA funds reached the Afghan resistance groups, including that of Osama bin Laden, during the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989. Oakley later worked for Delta-Nimir, the joint operation of the bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi families, the funders of Osama bin Laden and associates of the Bushes. Delta-Nimir was a partner of Unocal in the Afghan pipeline project and was already a major investor with Unocal in the oil fields of Azerbaijan, as I have outlined. At the same time as working for the Unocal consortium, Oakley and Khalilzad were also advising the US State Department.\" Another of those hired to \"advise\" and lobby on behalf of the Turkmenistan government in the early 1990s was Alexander Haig, the Knights of Malta initiate and formerly a Reagan-Bush Secretary of State, commander of NATO forces, and one-time military assistant to Henry Kissinger. Unocal gave the Taliban a fax machine to speed communications and funded a job training programme through the University of Nebraska in the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar to train people to work on the pipeline. Unocal flew Taliban officials to the United States for talks in early December 1997 and spent several days at their headquarters in Sugarland, Texas, enjoying star treatment. Sugarland is part of Houston, the home of the Bush family operations. The visit also included meetings with the State Department in Washington. There was no talk whatsoever about Taliban support for terrorism and Osama bin Laden, and no talk of handing him over. Instead Unocal \"offered them a generous cut of the profits\","},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"118 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. according to journalist John Pilger. 36 Dick Cheney was in Texas at this time as head of Halliburton, which stood to gain enormously from the Unocal-Taliban pipeline. Oops, sorry, Taliban we hate you What scuppered the Unocal deal, among other things, was the mounting outrage among women's groups at the Taliban's unbelievable abuse of women and their basic human rights. American women's groups began to organise protests against Unocal and the Feminist Majority Foundation in Los Angeles petitioned the California State Government to revoke Unocal's charter in response to their negotiations with the Taliban. It became impossible for the Taliban regime to be recognised. Then, in 1998, came the bombings of US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people, 12 of them American. Osama bin Laden was blamed for these outrages and President Clinton ordered the bombing of targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, two countries said to be protecting him. He also froze bin Laden's assets (it says here) and banned US firms from doing business with him. The Bush family must have been out of the country at the time and didn't hear that one. With these developments Unocal's plans were in ruins and they pulled out of the pipeline deal on December 4th 1998. John J. Maresca, Unocal's Vice President for International Relations, had told the House Committee on International Relations that the \"Taliban government in Afghanistan is an obstacle\" to the pipeline project and that \"construction of the pipeline cannot begin until a recognized government is in place in Kabul that has the confidence of governments, lenders, and our company.\" In the wake of September 11th, that is exactly what has happened, and the Afghanistan pipeline is now going to be built! This is all just a co-incidence, of course, and nothing to worry about. As the US Government Energy Information fact sheet on Afghanistan said in December 2000: \"Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint stems from its geographic position as a potential transit route for oil and natural gas exports from Central Asia to the Arabian Sea. This potential includes proposed multi-billion dollar oil and gas export pipelines through Afghanistan, although these plans have now been thrown into serious question ...\" Not, however, for long, it seems, thanks to September 11th and the bombing into oblivion of the Taliban. This invasion was ordered by the Bush administration, including Vice-President Dick Cheney. In May 2002, Mohammad Alim Razim, the Minister for Mines and Industries in the Interim government of \"Unocal's\" Hamid Karzai, announced plans to build the pipeline and he said that Unocal was the \"lead company\". 37 The BBC reported that the pipeline was expected to be built with \"funds from donor countries for the reconstruction of Afghanistan\". Put another way, the people that made a fortune from the invasion of Afghanistan through their arms sales will now have much of the cost of their pipeline met by taxpayers, er, sorry, \"aid to help the poor people of Afghanistan rebuild their country\". 38 Before this announcement, the BBC had reported how \"oil experts\" had dismissed the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 119 suggestion that the \"war on terrorism\" in Afghanistan was in any way about oil. It is so comforting to know that the academics understand what is happening in the world and thus can pass on their stunning insights to their students. Paul Stevens, Professor of Petroleum Policy and Economics at Dundee University, said: \"There was discussion of the pipeline to carry gas to Pakistan, but it was abandoned way before current events because of political, economic and stability problems. So the idea that oil is now driving this war is totally unrealistic. It would be more sensible to be considering a pipeline on the moon.\" 39 Which is where, on this evidence, Professor Stevens might choose to relocate. It's made of cheese you know. The drug connection (naturally) Anyone who has done even basic research into the Bush family and their network of placemen will always look for the drug connection, such is the enormous involvement they have with the global drug cartel. So it is with Vice President Dick Cheney, the long-time Bush crony and beneficiary. Michael C. Ruppert is a former officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) who also worked for its Organized Crime Intelligence Division. He now produces an excellent newsletter called From the Wilderness.\" In his edition of October 24th 2000, headed \"Halliburton Corporation's Brown & Root is one of the major components of the Bush-Cheney drug empire\", Ruppert highlights the role played in the Bush-Cheney drug network by the Halliburton subsidiary Brown & Root. This company is fundamentally connected to the US military, the intelligence agencies and their operations around the world, including Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, and employs 20,000 people in more than 100 countries. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was a CIA-backed operation and was used, in part, as the excuse for the US and British-controlled NATO to bomb and invade Serbia and Kosovo in support of Illuminati drug and oil pipeline interests. According to the Christian Science Monitor and Jane's Intelligence Review, the Kosovo Liberation Army controls 70% of the heroin entering western Europe. At the same time Cheney's Brown & Root was making billions with its US government supply and support contracts in the same region, as it still does today.\" It is amazing how the location of Brown & Root operations for the government and the drug running by government agencies tend to synchronise again and again, and this was highlighted in a report by the Center for Public Integrity (CPI)\" which suggests that drug money was involved in the financial success of Halliburton under Dick Cheney's leadership between 1995 and 2000 and, in particular, through its subsidiary Brown & Root. Then there are those \"loans\" given by US government agencies that paid for Brown & Root contracts abroad. Michael Ruppert writes: \"The loans had been granted by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private I nvestment Corporation. According to [CIA operative] Ralph McGehee's [publication] 'CIA Base' both institutions are heavily infiltrated by the CIA and routinely provide NOC [non official cover] to its officers. One of those loans to Russian financial/banking conglomerate, The Alfa Group of Companies, contained $292 million to pay for Brown and Root's contract to refurbish a Siberian oil field owned by the Russian Tyumen Oil Company."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"120 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. The Alfa Group completed its 51% acquisition of Tyumen Oil in what was allegedly a rigged bidding process in 1998. An official Russian government report claimed that the Alfa Group's top executives, oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven, 'allegedly participated i n the transit of drugs from Southeast Asia through Russia and into Europe.' These same executives, Fridman and Aven, who reportedly smuggled the heroin in connection with Russia's Solntsevo mob family, were the same ones who applied for the ... [US government] ... loans that Halliburton's lobbying later safely secured. As a result Brown and Root's work in Alfa Tyumen oil fields could continue - and expand. \"After describing how organized criminal interests in the Alfa Group had allegedly stolen the oil field by fraud, the [Center for Public Integrity] story, using official reports from the FSB (the Russian equivalent of the FBI), oil companies such as BP-Amoco, former CIA and KGB officers and press accounts, then established a solid link to Alfa Tyumen and the transportation of heroin. In 1995, sacks of heroin disguised as sugar were stolen from a rail container leased by Alfa-Echo and sold in the Siberian town of Khabarovsk. A problem arose when many residents of the town became 'intoxicated' or 'poisoned'.\" 43 The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) story also says that the Russian FSB (\"FBI\") report stated that within days of this incident, agents from the Ministry of Internal Affairs raided Alfa-Echo (or Eko) buildings to discover drugs and other \"compromising documentation\", and it was claimed that Alfa Bank has laundered drug funds from Russian and Colombian drug cartels. The CPI reported that the lead Washington attorney for the Russian Tyumen Oil Company was James C. Langdon, Jr of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. This is the same Akin, Gump which, as I highlighted earlier, represents the bin Laden financers Khalid bin Mahfouz and Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, and the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, which had its assets frozen by the US Treasury pending an investigation into alleged connections to the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Bin Mahfouz retained the services of Akin, Gump during the \"investigation\" into the BCCU\" The most famous name at Akin, Gump is Vernon Jordan, the associate of Bill Clinton and friend of Monica Lewinsky, and the firm is awash with cronies of the Bush family. The Center for Public Integrity report highlighting the drug connection to Cheney's Halliburton and Brown and Root also says that the Akin, Gump attorney James C. Langdon Jr \"helped coordinate a $2.2 million fund raiser for [ George W.] Bush ... He then agreed to help recruit 100 lawyers and lobbyists in the capital to raise $25,000 each for W's campaign.\" What a web. A personal story Michael Ruppert also tells of his own experience with the government, Brown & Root, and drugs in 1977 while he was with the Los Angeles Police Department. He said he travelled to New Orleans in June of that year to try to salvage his relationship with Nordica Theodora D'Orsay, or \"Teddy\", a CIA contract agent, who had suddenly disappeared. She had wanted him to participate in her operations from within the Los Angeles Police, but he said: \"I had refused to get"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • \"Big Dick\" Cheney \t 121 involved with drugs in any way and everything she mentioned seemed to involve either heroin or cocaine along with guns that she was always moving out of the country.\" 45 The Director of the CIA at this time was ... Father George Bush. Ruppert said he knew that Teddy's \"work\" involved the CIA, Los Angeles Police Department, the royal family of Iran, the Mafia and drugs. Ruppert says he found Teddy living in an apartment in Greta, New Orleans, equipped with \"scrambler phones, night vision devices and working from sealed communiques delivered by naval and air force personnel from nearby Belle Chasse Naval Air Station\". Teddy, he writes, was involved in \"something truly ugly\" - arranging for large quantities of weapons to be loaded onto ships for Iran and working with associates of New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello to coordinate the boat service delivering major shipments of heroin to the city. The boats arrived at Marcello-controlled docks, he says, \"unmolested by even the New Orleans police she introduced me to, along with divers, military men, former Green Berets and CIA personnel\". He continues: \"The service boats were retrieving the heroin from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, oil rigs i n international waters, oil rigs built and serviced by Brown and Root. The guns that Teddy monitored, apparently Vietnam era surplus AK 47s and M16s, were being loaded onto ships also owned or leased by Brown and Root. And more than once during the eight days I spent in New Orleans I met and ate at restaurants with Brown and Root employees who were boarding those ships and leaving for Iran within days.

As a result, he says, he was forced to leave the LAPD at the end of 1978 under threat of death. He says he complained to the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division and to the LA office of the FBI under the command of Ted Gunderson, a man who has become part of the \"conspiracy exposure\" movement in more recent times. Ruppert says he and his attorney wrote to the politicians, the Department of Justice, the CIA, and contacted the Los Angeles Times. The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department claimed he was crazy. Where have I heard that before? In 1981 a two-part news story in the Los Angeles Herald Examiner revealed that the FBI had taken \"Teddy\" into custody, but released her with no further action. Aaron Cohen, a former New Orleans Crime Commissioner, told the paper that after 30 years of studying Louisiana's organized crime operations he found Ruppert's description of events to be \"perfectly plausible \" . 47 Ruppert says that, to this day, a CIA report prepared as a result of his complaint remains classified and exempt from release \"pursuant to Executive Order of the President in the interests of national security and because it would reveal the identities of CIA agents\". His written testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, dated October 1st 1997, can be found at http:llwww.copvcia.comhttp:llwww.copvcia.com/ssci.htm.

(Fuller became Chief of Staff to Vice President Father George Bush from 1981 to 1985.) Ruppert says he later learned more of the background to what he witnessed in New Orleans: \"in 1982, then UCLA [University of California] political science professor Paul Jabber filled in many of the pieces in my quest to understand what I had seen in New Orleans. He was qualified to do so because he had served as a CIA and State Department consultant to the Carter administration. Paul explained that, after a 1975 treaty between the Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein, the Shah had cut off all overt military support for Kurdish rebels fighting Saddam from the north of Iraq. In exchange, the Shah had gained access to the Shat al-Arab waterway so that he could multiply his oil exports and income. Not wanting to lose a long-term valuable asset in the Kurds, the CIA had then used Brown and Root, which operated in both countries and maintained port facilities in the Persian Gulf and near Shat al-Arab, to rearm the Kurds. The whole operation had been financed with heroin. Paul was matter-of-fact about it. In 1983 Paul Jabber left UCLA to become a Vice President of Banker's Trust and Chairman of the Middle East Department of the Council on Foreign Relations.\" 48 What Michael Ruppert says fits with my own full-time research since 1991, which has listed endless examples of what he describes all over the world as Illuminati governments, corporations and organised crime inter-connect. Ruppert suggests that ...\"the relationships between key institutions, players and the Bushes themselves suggest that under a George \"W\" administration the Bush family and its allies may well be able, using Brown & Root as the operational interface, to control the drug trade all the way from Medellin to Moscow\". Brown & Root, the company ultimately controlled by Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, had no presence in Colombia apparently until 1997 when it suddenly began to acquire nearly a million square feet of warehouse space. \"Watch that space\" would seem to be the best advice going on past experience. What do they know about Colombia that the public do not? One of the most obvious Bush-US Government drug operations was the already discussed Iran-Contra period in the 1980s in which Oliver North was a major figure. Cathy O'Brien tells in Trance-Formation of America of attending drugs parties in which the drug-running North was among the guests. 49 Cheney was a vehement defender of North's Iran-Contra activities while serving on the House Intelligence Committee, and supported his election campaign for a Senate seat in Virginia in 1994. Fortunately North didn't make it. So there you have some of the appalling background to Dick Cheney who, with Father George, is the immediate power behind the throne, or high chair, of President Bush. It would not surprise me in the least if Boy George was assassinated in a staged \"terrorist attack\" to dramatically increase the problem-reaction-solution possibilities of the \"war on terrorism\". After all, his code-name in the Skull and Bones Society was \"Temporary\" and if Bush were to go, who would be president?

Confucius I could continue for chapters detailing the fantastic web of interconnected corruption that underpins the entire global government, banking, business, military and media structure. It is almost impossible to exaggerate what is really going on behind the \"movie screen\" and it is vital to understand this if we are going to see September 11th in its true context. Before I focus specifically on the events of that day and their aftermath I will briefly summarise some essential information about the other famous names that have sold us the lie about 9/11 and used it to j ustify the \"war on terrorism\". Used car, anyone? Colin Powell and Richard Armitage I put these two together because they are so close to each other and they now head the US State Department in the \"war against sanity\". George W. Bush named Powell as his Secretary of State and Powell chose Armitage as his deputy. Colin Luther Powell is seen by most Americans as some kind of \"war hero\", a man you can trust. In fact, like those around him in the Bush administration, he is a terrorist under any accepted definition of the word. Colin Powell moralising about the need to \"stop terrorism\" is like Bill Clinton delivering a lecture on celibacy. The Bush family has sponsored his career and he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military head of U.S forces, when Father George and Dick Cheney launched the Gulf War in 1991. It was obvious that when the Bushes, Cheney and Powell got together again at the start of 2001, with Boy George as the voice of his father, that the United States would find itself in another war. I wrote on my website davidicke.com on Bush's inauguration day, January 20th 2001: \"Powell, like the Bushes and Cheney, is bloodline and that's why he is to be the new Secretary of State. Given that line-up and their mentality and agenda, don't be at all surprised if the United States finds itself in another manipulated war during this administration.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. It took only months. The rise and rise of Colin Powell Father George appointed Powell as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, US Department of Defense, in 1989. At 52, Powell became the youngest head of the Joint Chiefs and the first African-American. In this position he would serve the Bush Illuminati agenda in the manufactured \"wars\" not only in Iraq, but also in Panama, Somalia and elsewhere. Many researchers have demolished the Powell myth and some are detailed in the sources at the end of this chapter.' They have exposed his long record of breaking international human rights legislation - and worse - in the Iran-Contra scandal, the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989, the Gulf War, and others. His confidants and sponsors say it all, really. Apart from Father George, these include Casper Weinberger and Frank C. Carlucci, both former Secretaries of Defense; Richard L. Armitage; Vernon E. Jordan, Jr; and Dick Cheney. 2 Weinberger was charged over Iran-Contra, but was pardoned by George Bush in the last days of his presidency; Carlucci is a former number two at the CIA and now chairman of the Bush-and Baker-dominated Carlyle Group; Dick Cheney speaks for itself; Vernon E. Jordan is the friend of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and a lawyer with Akin, Gump, et al, which represents the Osama bin Laden backers and Bush family business associates, Khalid bin Mahfouz and Mohammad Hussein al-Amoudi. Jordan is a serious insider with more than 50 honorary doctorates at U.S universities including Yale and Harvard, and is connected to a stream of Illuminati organisations like the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, Joint Center for Political Studies, Brookings Institution, Ford Foundation, American Express, Bankers Trust, and Dow Jones. Powell described Richard Armitage in his book, My American Journey,' as \"my brother and my bodyguard\". According to a Los Angeles Times article by John Broder: \"Some of Powell's advice comes from others through Armitage, thus insulating Powell from directly consulting people who might then be identified as his 'advisers'.\" In short, Powell and Armitage are real close. The other drug-running \"Dick\" Interesting, then, that Armitage is another Bush family clone and confidant who served under Father George and Ronald Reagan, and has been widely implicated in some deeply unpleasant activities. Armitage has been accused by many sources of involvement in drug running, hit squads, and CIA dirty tricks on behalf of US administrations (the Illuminati). James 'Bo' Gritz, a former Operations Colonel in the Green Berets, says he investigated claims that US prisoners of war from Vietnam were still being held many years after the end of the conflict when they should have long been released. In his 1991 book, Called To Serve, and an accompanying video,' Gritz named Richard Armitage, Powell's close friend and deputy Secretary of State in today's \"war on terrorism\", as a major middleman between the US government and General Khun Sa, then the leading \"warlord\" operating in the Golden Triangle of the international opium trade. Gritz wrote:"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 127 \"If Richard Armitage was, as Khun Sa avowed, a major participant in parallel government drug trafficking, then it explained why our efforts to rescue POWs had been i nexplicably foiled, time after time ... If it was true, Richard Armitage would be the last man in the world who would desire to see prisoners of war come home alive.\" 5 Gritz said that Khun Sa told him the United States government had purchased all of the opium supply for 1989 - some 900 tons. When Gritz returned to Burma five months later, Khun Sa agreed to be interviewed on video and name the names of the US government agents he worked with, although he said the names were old ones and not the current operatives. He said the government official in charge of buying the opium crop was Richard Armitage and that he was working with the notorious Mafia boss in Florida, Santos Trafficante. Khun Sa said he was paid $300,000 a ton for the opium while officials of the US government were selling it on the streets of America and elsewhere for $1 million a ton. This is a major way that the Illuminati fund their covert projects without using traceable sources. Gritz approached President Father George Bush to reveal what he had discovered, but Bush didn't want to know for a simple reason - he was heavily involved himself. These claims of involvement in drug running and arms trafficking by Armitage have reportedly been supported by staff at the US Embassy in Bangkok and his appointment was ended by the United States Ambassador to Thailand at the time, Morton Abramowitz. Among those who have exposed the gruesome activities of Armitage is the excellent researcher and writer, David Guyatt, and you can read his comprehensive article about Bush, Armitage, and the CIA-sponsored cocaine and heroin network in South-East Asia on his website. 6 Guyatt writes: \"Behind the scenes, a virtual war was in progress as the department of Justice and the FBI fought to indict Armitage for his narcotics and other criminal activities. Attorney General Thornburg, a political appointee of President Bush, powerfully resisted these measures. Significantly, however, Armitage was also under scrutiny by Federal I nvestigators working for the President's Commission on Organized Crime, with a focus on foreign organized criminal activity in gambling and drug trafficking. \" Meanwhile, yet another investigator who believed Armitage was 'dirty' was frustrated in his investigations by Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense [now chairman of the Carlyle Group], and other powerful patrons. In 1975 during Armitage's CIA tour in Vietnam, Carlucci was number two at the CIA. Because of the numerous high level obstructions, investigations into Armitage's criminal activities were curtailed, but not before some damaging information had been gathered ... Such was the strength of the i nformation developed on Armitage that he was forced to abandon his nomination for Secretary of the Army, and, in fact, all other official US government posts. Subsequently, Defense officials stated privately that Armitage would never again be permitted to darken the doors of the Department of Defense. [Instead he darkens the doors of Colin Powell's State Department.]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"128 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. \"Known as 'Mr Phu' (literally meaning 'Mr Rich') amongst the Vietnamese community, Armitage, despite his disgrace, was still able to count on the enormous power of his political patrons and avoided criminal prosecution. Knowing far too much about US government 'dirt' during the previous three decades provided him with an instant 'do not go to jail' card.\" 7 Armitage withdrew from his nomination by Father George to be Secretary of the Army in 1989 because he would have faced a confirmation hearing amid reports that organisations representing US war veterans were preparing to oppose him in the light of his activities in South-East Asia. Armitage has also been linked, along with characters like Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines, to Project Phoenix, the CIA mass-murder unit in South-East Asia that I mentioned earlier. Former CIA officer Ralph McGehee, who has since tried to tell some truth about the agency, says that between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix, or Phuong Hoang, Operation rounded up hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and them turned over to the Vietnamese police for \"questioning\" (brutal torture).' Tens of thousands (at least) were murdered through Project Phoenix, most of them perfectly innocent civilians. By late 1975, Armitage is reported to have been working out of Bangkok and reports suggest that in the period 1976 to 1979 he was involved with Shackley, Clines and Iran-Contra operative Richard Secord, in setting up a number of corporations and subsidiaries around the world including Lake Resources, Stanford Technology Trading Group, Companie de Services Fiduciaria, CSF Investments and Udall Research Corporation. During this time, Secord was in Iran coordinating the sale of US military aircraft and weapons to Middle Eastern countries.' Oil, drugs and the upper reaches of politics constantly go together. After Armitage did not become Secretary of the Army, Father Bush made him a personal envoy holding the rank of Ambassador and under this guise Armitage went to the former Soviet Union to assist it with its \"economic development\" in 1989. This was j ust as the race for control of the Caspian oil and gas fields was really getting under way after the \"fall\" of Soviet Communism and new drug routes were being organised, which include Azerbaijan. Interestingly, Armitage is a member of the United States Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce along with ... Dick Cheney. They are also both members of the Illuminati \"think tank\", the Aspen Institute, which is mentioned in some of my other books. Armitage is reported to have visited Burma in 1997 on a trip sponsored by the Burma/Myanmar Forum, a group in Washington DC that enjoys major sponsorship from Unocal.'° This is the same Richard Armitage who is now Deputy Secretary of State to his extremely close friend, Colin Powell; the same Armitage who tells the world who is responsible for September 11th and who should be bombed and murdered in response. Armitage knows the Afghanistan region well. He was an American \"adviser\" during the war between the Afghanistan Mujahadin and the Soviet Union when Osama bin Laden's network was funded and armed into existence by the CIA. Armitage and Powell apparently first met in 1981 and a Powell profile in USA Weekend in 1993\" said that after Powell became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush, he and"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The rest of the gang \t 129 Armitage ... \"started to call each other daily to share information and bounce ideas off each other ... They have become sounding boards for just about anything the other guy wants to discuss. Often they talk, if only briefly, two or three times a day.\" Newsweek reported that Armitage \"may be Powell's closest friend\". Frankie's everywhere The guy who protected Armitage from prosecution for crimes against humanity in both South-East Asia and on the streets of the United States was Frank C. Carlucci III, the former Assistant Director of the CIA during the Jimmy Carter presidency and both Secretary of Defense and National Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan (i.e. George Bush). He is now chairman of the Carlyle Group. Colin Powell has referred to Carlucci many times as his \"mentor\"!!! This does not surprise me a bit given Carlucci's background and the desperate company that Powell chooses to keep. Karl Evanzz says in his book, The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X, 12 that Carlucci's appointment as Consul and Second-Secretary of the US Embassy in Stanleyville, the Congo, was a cover for a CIA operation that included the plot to assassinate the recently elected President Patrice Lumumba in 1961. Five months after Lumumba was assassinated, Carlucci was arrested, expelled from the Congo, and returned to the US. He was expelled from Tanzania in 1965 after he was i mplicated in the CIA assassination of the Burundi Prime Minister Pierre Ngendandumwe. Carlucci would later be appointed to major positions, including Secretary of Defense, by Bush and Reagan because, clearly, he was just the sort of character they needed for their agenda. This is the man that Colin Powell calls his \"mentor\" while lecturing the world on the outrages and dangers of terrorism! Colin Powell, this is your life With a line-up of characters like these supporting Colin Powell it is clear that he is bloodline and that he would, by definition, have an interesting \"history\". Colin Powell was born in 1937 into a family of Jamaican immigrants and was brought up in the South Bronx area of New York City. He decided to make the Army his career and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1958. It was Colin Powell who \"investigated\" the infamous My Lai Massacre. This was when members of the US Army's Americal Division entered the hamlet of My Lai 4 in South Vietnam on March 16th 1968, tortured and murdered hundreds of civilians, and raped countless women and young girls. The horror was reported by Tom Glen, a soldier who told of his own involvement at My Lai in a letter to General Creighton Abrams, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, but his claims were dismissed and covered up. Major Colin Powell, the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, G-3, at Americal Division headquarters, was ordered to investigate the claims and \"report within three days with a suggested reply to Glen\", according to an article in The New Republic.\" Powell's report decided that Glen's story was not true except, possibly, for \"isolated instances\". He added: \"In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.\" The New Republic article concluded that a proper investigation of the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"130 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. charges made by Tom Glen may have led to a legitimate inquiry into the My Lai Massacre and into others that \"included a company that had gone along with Tom Glen's on March 16th 1968 and committed a separate massacre of ninety people at My Khe, for which no one was ever punished\". However, Powell did not choose to investigate the My Lai massacre and it was only later when a second soldier, Ron Ridenhour, gave details to a congressman that the army was forced to investigate publicly and Powell's original \"investigation\" was shown to be a sham and a cover- up of the atrocities against Vietnamese civilians. But Powell, who knows how to fall in a bog and come out clean, even managed to secure a Legion of Merit citation during the Ridenhour investigation. Clearly from early in his military career, Colin Powell's desire to see justice done and terrorism punished would not appear to be his guiding light. When he returned to the United States, Powell's career began to progress rapidly under the Illuminati sponsorship of characters like Weinberger and Carlucci. He attended George Washington University and thanks to his powerful backers he progressed through the hierarchy at the Pentagon. He became National Security Adviser in 1987 to Reagan-Bush, a post previously held by people like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who are both extremely significant players in the Illuminati web (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free). National Security Adviser, like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State, is a major Illuminati appointment and Powell has been all three. While he was Senior Military Assistant to Secretary of Defense Weinberger during the Reagan years, he played a major role in operations like the invasion of Grenada and the US bombing (based on false \"evidence\") of Libya. It was also during this period with Weinberger that Powell was implicated in the Iran-Contra affair in which Weinberger was fundamentally involved. Weinberger kept details of the illegal transfer of arms to Iran in a personal diary that he compiled at meetings of the National Security Council. Yet Powell supported Weinberger in denying the existence of the diary before later having to admit the claims were true. Powell told the Iran-Contra investigation under oath: \"The Secretary, to my knowledge, did not keep a diary. Whatever notes he kept, I don't know how he uses them or what he does with them. He does not have a diary...\" But in a later sworn statement, he said: \"During the period I worked with Secretary Weinberger ... I observed on his desk a small pad of white paper ... I viewed it as his personal diary ... Knowing Secretary Weinberger as I did and knowing the routine way he would jot down notes on these pads ... I considered them a private diary.\" Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Powell's testimony was \"at least misleading\", but \"did not warrant prosecution.\" Funnily enough, the Iran-Contra Special Counsel's report said virtually the same about Powell's best buddy, Richard Armitage: \"Independent Counsel declined to prosecute Armitage because the OIC's"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 131 li mited resources were focused on the case against Weinberger and because the evidence against Armitage, while substantial, did not reach the threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" From the National Security Archive comes this account of Powell's involvement: \" Weinberger testified before the [Senate Select] Committee [on Intelligence] that later that day he received a call from Poindexter informing him of the President's action [to send weapons to Iran]. Weinberger ... instructed military aide, Major General Colin Powell, to arrange the transfer of the weapons ... to the CIA, and that the matter was to be closely held at the direction of the President. General Powell had had previous discussions with North about the program and about Israel's problems in getting replacement TOW's [missiles] ... According to Armitage and a CIA official, Powell worked with Major General Vincent Russo of the Defense Logistics Agency to provide the material securely and without any loss of funds for the Army.\" 14 Powell's best buddy Richard Armitage was also involved with Oliver North. According to North's book, Under Fire, 15 they served together on a secret CIA \"anti- terrorism unit\" that North chaired. Powell, as National Security Adviser to Reagan, threatened to stop all US aid to South American countries that would not support the Contra terrorist war in Nicaragua and he would have been further drawn into the investigative web of Iran-Contra had George Bush not outrageously pardoned Powell's boss, Casper Weinberger and others involved in the scandal in the closing days of his presidency. Powell would have been very relieved. His career has included leading US forces in George Bush's drug-related invasion of Manuel Noriega's Panama in 1989 after he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thousands of Panamanian civilians were killed and whole areas of civilian homes were destroyed. This was covered up by controlling where the media could go, incinerating bodies and dumping corpses in mass graves before they were identified, and taking control of all registration by taking over hospitals and mortuaries. Two years later, Powell led US forces in the Gulf War in which at least 200,000 Iraqis died, according to a speech at Bohemian Grove shortly after the conflict by John Lehman, Reagan's first Navy Secretary. Under Powell's leadership in Iraq, civilian areas were targeted, conscripts were buried alive in their trenches by bulldozers, more than 40 tons of radioactive material was scattered across the desert by bombs using depleted uranium, oil refineries were set on fire, and thousands of civilians, prisoners and retreating Iraqi soldiers were coldly and systematically murdered on the infamous \"Highway of Death\". This, and so much more, under the leadership of \"war hero\" Colin Powell, the friend of so many deeply disturbed people, and now the US Secretary of State helping to dictate the \"war on terrorism\". Powell claims he never once received an illegal order during his military career (utter claptrap) and yet the actions of his troops in those Iraqi massacres alone should have prompted charges relating to war crimes. Colin Powell's record of serving the Illuminati interests - and taking the rewards - with invasions and massacres of poor and defenceless peoples in Grenada, Panama, Iraq,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"132 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Haiti and elsewhere is grotesque, and this is the man, like the Bushes, Cheney and the rest of them, who is moralising about freedom and justice while systematically destroying both throughout the world. Apart from sending others to the battlefield and orchestrating the slaughter of the innocent, Powell has also had a career in business. He has served on the boards of America Online (AOL) and Gulf stream Aerospace, which makes planes for governments like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and for Hollywood movies stars. The current Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, also served on Gulfstream's board and had stock worth $11 million when US defence contractor, General Dynamics in 1999, bought the company. I don't know what Powell made from the deal, but he is reported to have earned $4 million in increased stock value when AOL merged with that Illuminati front, TimeWarner. His son, Michael K. Powell, was the only commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) who said the merger deal should be allowed to go through without scrutiny. He denied any conflict of interest with his father's shareholding in AOL at the time, which was worth some $13 million according to newspaper reports. The FCC calls itself an \"independent\" United States government agency (I love it), which regulates \"interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable\"... [in the] ... \"50 states, the District of Columbia, and US possessions\" . 16 In fact, Michael K. Powell, a 1999 Henry Crown Fellow of the (Illuminati) Aspen Institute, does not appear to be in favour of much regulation of media corporations, an attitude that suits the gang perfectly. Two days after his inauguration in January 2001, President George W. Bush appointed a new chairman of the FCC ... Michael K. Powell. The man he replaced, William Kennard, now works for the Carlyle Group. Donald Rumsfeld - Mr Aspartame Bush's Defense Secretary in the \"war on terrorism\" is Donald Rumsfeld, a long-time insider with an impeccable record of service to the global agenda. After attending Princeton University and serving in the Navy, he began his career in Washington DC as an administrative assistant. He was elected to Congress from his home state of Illinois in 1962 and joined the Richard Nixon administration (controlled by Illuminati Secretary of State Henry Kissinger) in 1969. Rumsfeld was a member of the Nixon cabinet from 1971 to 1972 - the year of the Watergate break-in, the sting on Nixon orchestrated by Kissinger (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). In 1973 as the Watergate storm unfolded, Rumsfeld went to Europe as US Ambassador to NATO before returning the following year when Nixon had been ousted. He became chairman of the transition to the presidency of the unelected, Watergate- i mposed Gerald Ford and his Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Rumsfeld joined the Ford cabinet as Chief of Staff at the White House (which means he must have been very acceptable to Kissinger) and he became US Secretary of Defense for the first time between 1975 and 1977.

During his time as Chairman and Chief Executive of G D"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The rest of the gang \t 133 Searle, the pharmaceutical company now owned by the appalling Monsanto, he was given a stream of appointments in and by government. These were: member of the President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control - Reagan Administration (1982 - 1986); Reagan's Special Envoy on the Law of the Sea Treaty (1982 - 1983); senior adviser to Reagan's Panel on Strategic Systems (1983 - 1984); member of the US Joint Advisory Commission on US/Japan Relations - Reagan Administration (1983 - 1984); President Reagan's Special Envoy to the Middle East (1983 - 1984); member of the National Commission on the Public Service (1987 - 1990); member of the National Economic Commission (1988 - 1989); member of the Board of Visitors of the National Defense University (1988 - 1992); member of the Commission on US/Japan Relations (1989 - 1991); Federal Communications Commission High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992 - 1993); chairman, Commission on the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States (1998 - 1999); member of the US Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999 - 2000); and chairman of the US Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization (2000).\" How helpful all these government connections proved when as head of G D Searle, he used his Washington insider contacts to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the go-ahead to market the infamous artificial sweetener, aspartame. Rumsfeld was to Searle what Cheney was (is) to Halliburton. (I describe the manipulation of the FDA decision in Children Of The Matrix.) Aspartame consists of two synthetic amino acids, phenylalanine (50%) and aspartic acid (40 %) bound in methanol (10%). FDA documents released under the Freedom of Information Act in 1995 reveal that the consequences of this horrendous substance include blindness and death. Others, according to scientists, are brain tumours, brain lesions, headaches, mood swings, skin polyps, insomnia, depression, suppression of intelligence and effects on short-term memory. Investigative author and food specialist Carol Guilford calls aspartame a \"molecular holocaust\".\" This is the mind suppressant (sorry \"sweetener\") for which Donald Rumsfeld was hired by Searle in 1977 to win government approval. In January 1981, with the Rumsfeld's friends in power under Bush and Reagan, he told a sales meeting, according to one attendee, that he would \"call in his markers\" and get aspartame approved by the end of the year. Immediately the then commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration had his authority suspended and the job was given to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes, a professor and contract researcher for the Defense Department. His first major decision was to approve the use of aspartame in dry foods and his last, in 1983, was to approve it for soft drinks. This was despite all the evidence of its consequences and the opposition of his own board of inquiry. Hayes then left the FDA to become a senior adviser to the public relations firm of ... Rumsfeld's G D Searle. Rumsfeld earned millions for manipulating a truly horrible substance into widespread use and he picked up a $12 million bonus when Searle was bought by the Nazi-connected Monsanto, the promoter of genetically modified ( GM) food. Orrin Hatch, the Mormon senator from Utah, also took money from Searle for pressing their case on aspartame, and he worked to suppress independent"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"134 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. studies into its safety. Hatch was also the man who promoted the BCCI and said i mmediately after 9 / 11 that the authorities believed that Osama bin Laden could be responsible. The Food and Drug Administration in America, like its equivalent in other countries, is an Illuminati front to block products that are good for humanity and to push through, without proper testing, those that suit the agenda. This happened with aspartame thanks to Rumsfeld. First, the FDA approved its use on the basis of ridiculous data and then had to withdraw that permission in the face of studies showing that it caused seizures and brain tumours in animals. But the FDA restored approval in 1981 thanks to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes, despite the unanimous opposition of a Public Board of Inquiry, which had reviewed the scientific data and recommended a delay. Dr Ralph G. Walton, a Professor of Psychiatry at North Eastern Ohio University College of Medicine, reviewed all the studies on aspartame and found 166 with relevance for human safety. All of the 74 studies funded by the aspartame industry gave it the all-clear, but 92% of those independently funded revealed safety problems. Which ones would you believe? The reason this poison was approved against all the evidence is simple corruption. A commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, an acting commissioner, six other operatives, and two attorneys assigned to prosecute NutraSweet for submitting fraudulent tests, left the organisation to work for ... NutraSweet, a trade name for aspartame. One genuine scientist working for the FDA wrote to a US senator: \"It's like a script for Abbott and Costello. It works like this: ' approve our poison, and when you stop being a bureaucrat we'll make you a plutocrat! After it's licensed we'll pay off the American Dietetics, the American Diabetes Association, the American Medical Association and anyone we need who's for sale'.\" The man orchestrating all this was Donald Rumsfeld, now US \"Defense\" Secretary in the \"war on terrorism\". Clearly a man you can trust. By the way, the Monsanto Corporation of St Louis, Missouri, expanded the accredited uses for aspartame after taking over Rumsfeld's G D Searle in 1985. Monsanto is an Illuminati company to its fingertips and the promoter of genetically modified food, another part of the Illuminati assault on the human mind and body. It is using the same methods to win approval for genetically modified food as it did for aspartame. The current Bush administration is awash with people connected to Monsanto. A few other \"characters\" John Ashcroft, George W. Bush's Attorney General, is one of the Monsanto funded insiders in Boy George's US government. Ashcroft is another with his snout in the corporate trough with Microsoft and Enron among his benefactors. When the Enron scandal broke, with President Bush's biggest funder collapsing amid document shredding and fantastic corruption, we had the farcical situation in which Attorney General Ashcroft could not take part in the subsequent investigation because he had taken money from them! In the November 2000 election for the Senate, Ashcroft failed even to beat a dead man. His opponent, the Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, died in a plane crash with his son and campaign adviser while flying in a Cessna to a campaign rally. Carnahan's name stayed on the ballot paper and more"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  The rest of the gang \t 135 people voted for him than Ashcroft. It was the first time anyone had posthumously won election to the Senate. He couldn't do any worse than the live ones, that's for sure. Ashcroft was soon back in Washington, however, when the incoming President Bush named him as US Attorney General. This is the man who has been dismantling basic human freedoms in the United States since September 11th with an enthusiasm and glee that can only be described as orgasmic. He was appointed by Boy George to replace the deeply corrupt Janet Reno, she of Waco mass murder fame. Attorney General is another big Illuminati-nominated post. Ashcroft is a member of the \"Religious Right\" that has spawned Bush family clones like the monumental hypocrite Pat Robertson (see Children Of The Matrix) who has used his \"ministry\" and massive public donations to his \"humanitarian projects\" to expand his business empire in places like the Congo when it was ruled by his friend, the vicious and corrupt dictator, Mobuto Sese-Seko. Show me a member of the \"Religious Right\" and I'll show you a hypocrite, or, at least, it has never failed yet. Anyway, this is the \"spiritual\" home of John Ashcroft, the freedom-destroying Attorney General, who has seized on the deaths of thousands in New York and Washington to cast aside basic human freedoms. Ashcroft describes himself as a Christian conservative who doesn't smoke, drink or dance. He is against abortion because it takes a human life created by God, and yet supports the death penalty and the murder of men, women, and children, in their thousands every month in Iraq, and mass murder in many other parts of the world like Afghanistan. Ashcroft's claim to fame before he became an official freedom-buster for the Bush administration was his \"war on drugs\" and addictive substances (like the many Father George Bush headed while running drugs himself). Ashcroft demands the death penalty for such offences. Bad news, eh, Georgie? At the same time Ashcroft has taken $44,500 from liquor companies since 1993, including $20,000 from the St Louis-based Anheuser-Busch. He has also been lauded by the booze industry in a video tribute produced by the Beer Institute of America. When Mother Jones magazine questioned this contradiction, Ashcroft said: \"It is a product that it is in demand [yes, like drugs] and when it's used responsibly it's like other products.\" Ashcroft also accepted money from the tobacco industry for his 1994 Senate race and said of tobacco that people should be free to make bad choices. Unless Ashcroft decides otherwise, that is. Here you have another hypocrite with a selective morality that changes by the sentence to meet the needs of the moment. This is the guy, people of America, who is taking your freedom away. The \"anti-terrorism\" terrorist John Negroponte is President Bush's Ambassador to the United Nations, clearly a vital role in the \"war on terrorism\". Negroponte knows all about the subject from his days as US ambassador to Honduras between 1981 and 1985 where he helped to coordinate America's covert war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. During his spell in Honduras, US aid to that country soared from $3.9 million in 1980 to $77.4 million in 1984. This funded so many US bases and so much weaponry that the country became known as USS Honduras.

The outstanding Australian journalist (a real one), John Pilger, wrote in the UK's New Statesman magazine: \"How appropriate that John Negroponte is Bush's ambassador at the United Nations. This week, he delivered America's threat to the world that it may 'require' to attack more and more countries. As US ambassador to Honduras in the early 1980s, Negroponte oversaw American funding of the regime's death squads, known as Battalion 316, that wiped out the democratic opposition, while the CIA ran its 'contra' war of terror against neighbouring Nicaragua. Murdering teachers and slitting the throats of midwives were a speciality.\" 19 I can see why Bush chose him, then. Wendy \"pathet lao\" Chamberlain The US Ambassador to Pakistan who has played a pivotal role in the vital relationship between Pakistan and the United States since September 11th is Wendy Chamberlain, who is described innocently in an official profile I read as a \"mother of two\". The lady is rather more than that, as you would expect as an appointee of George W. Bush, or, more accurately, of those who control him. (Forgive me if I find it hard to believe that Boy George is making the foreign policy decisions when, during his election campaign, he thought Nigeria was a continent, failed to name the presidents of Chechnya, Pakistan and India, confused Slovakia and Slovenia, and asserted that Greeks were called 'Grecians' and East Timorese were East Timorians.) 20 Before Bush sent Wendy Chamberlain to Pakistan in the weeks before 9/11, she was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the International Narcotics and Law Bureau of the State Department. But she is best known for her period as US Ambassador to Laos while that country was controlled by the terrorists of the Pathet Lao regime. She got along with these terrorist dictators extremely well, it would appear. Philip Smith, director of the Lao Veterans of America, led the opposition to Chamberlain's appointment to Pakistan from the 350,000-strong Lao and Hmong exile community in the United States. \"The freedom-loving people in Pakistan, Afghanistan and South Asia need to be informed and aware that Wendy Chamberlain has a deplorable track record of utter and total appeasement,\" he said. \"She has never met a military general or dictatorship that she did not like.\" A letter circulated on the Internet by the Lao Veterans, dated June 29th 2001, urged confirmation hearings to block Chamberlain's appointment to Pakistan and revealed some of the \"highlights\" of her period in Laos: \"The Laotian and Hmong-American community is overwhelmingly opposed to the confirmation of Wendy Chamberlain as Ambassador to Pakistan given her deplorable track-record of total appeasement in Laos (see news report from Washington, DC, in Agence France Press, June 26th 2001).

She worked to strengthen"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 137 the hands of the generals and the military dictatorship. We, therefore, ask that you put an immediate \"hold\" on her confirmation on the Senate floor to send a powerful message that State Department officials involved in countenancing crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations against the relatives of Lao and Hmong- Americans will not be rewarded with promotions - especially a promotion to such an i mportant position. Moreover, by putting a \"hold\" on Chamberlain on the Senate Floor, it will send an important message that a new policy toward Laos is needed-not the weak and pandering policy of appeasement that Chamberlain so vigorously promoted and that cost so many innocent people their lives. \"Clearly, Ambassador Chamberlain has never met a military general or dictatorship that she did not like - and did not work to appease. She is utterly unfit for a senior Ambassadorship in Pakistan, a country of immense importance to US national security i nterests, compared to the tiny, third-world nation of Laos, which she, somehow, totally bungled at the cost of many lives. It should be noted that Ms Chamberlain served disgracefully as US Ambassador to Laos where she \"went native\" (dressing in native costumes at late-night parties with Pathet Lao communist generals where she frequently drank excessively and submissively catered to every whim of the military junta at the expense of the United States and its citizens). Indeed, Chamberlain worked overtime to appease the military generals in Laos - while the relatives of Lao and Hmong-Americans died at the cruel hands of the regime. She also countenanced the massacre of thousands of Hmong and Lao civilians and opposition leaders in Laos during her deplorable tenure. Moreover, she did nothing to gain access or intervene to reopen Xeng Khouang (Xieng Khouang), Sysamboun \"Special Zone,\" and other often- closed areas of Laos - including the Lao gulag system in Sam Neua and elsewhere - where military crackdowns and ethnic cleansing operations occurred against thousands of Hmong and Lao people.\" 21 She sounds like a perfect Bush appointment. In fact, Chamberlain's behaviour in Laos was so disgraceful that the US House of Representatives took the unprecedented step of introducing legislation in response.\" House Resolution 332 cites Chamberlain's behaviour and methods that included the collaboration with communist Pathet Lao officials (terrorists) over the disappearance of two Hmong- Americans. This was the lady appointed by Bush to the key post of Ambassador to Pakistan months before 9 / 11 and the \"war on terrorism\" in which Pakistan would be of major importance. Bush, or rather his masters, also appointed Christina Rocca as US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia weeks before 9/11. Her bureau is responsible for US foreign policy and relations with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Rocca is a career officer of the CIA going back through the Father Bush and Reagan years at least to 1982. She, like Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, was involved in CIA operations relating to the war between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union when Osama bin Laden's terrorist network was funded and armed into being by the CIA. Rocca has shown a keen interest in Afghanistan and Pakistan affairs for many years."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"138 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. The Queen's buddy Coordinating communications between Washington and London since September 11th has been the American Ambassador to Britain (or the Court of St James's to be accurate), one William Stamps Farish III. This is the grandson of William Stamps Farish, the president of the Rockefellers' Standard Oil, New Jersey, (now Exxon), when they were supplying Hitler and the Nazis with fuel during the Second World War. A letter written by Standard Oil Vice President Frank A. Howard, to William S. Farish was released by the US Justice Department at the time. Remember that I.G. Farben was at the very core of the Nazi war machine and ran concentration camps like the one at Auschwitz. The letter to Farish said: \"... I n England I met by appointment the Royal Dutch [Shell Oil] gentlemen from Holland and ... a general agreement was reached on the necessary changes in our relations with the I.G. [Farben], in view of the state of war ... the Royal Dutch Shell Group is essentially British ...I also had several meetings with the [British] air ministry ... \"I required the help to obtain the necessary permission to go to Holland ... After discussions with the [American] Ambassador [Joseph Kennedy, JFK's father] ... the situation was cleared completely ... The gentlemen of the Air Ministry ... very kindly offered to assist me in re-entering England. \"Pursuant to these arrangements, I was able to keep my appointment in Holland (having been flown there on a British Air Force bomber), where I had three days of discussion with the representatives of I.G. They delivered to me assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and ... we did our best to work out complete plans for a modus vivendi which could operate through the term of the war, whether or not the US came in.\" William S. Farish refuelled Nazi shipping and submarines in Spain and Latin America during the war and it was the Standard Oil/I.G. Farben enterprise that opened the Auschwitz Camp on June 14th 1940, and used the slave labour of Jews, political opponents, gypsies, and others to produce artificial rubber and gasoline from coal. Farish was very close to Hermann Schmitz, the chairman of I.G. Farben. Standard Oil hired the Illuminati publicist Ivy Lee to promote I.G. Farben and the Nazis in the United States (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background). In this same period, Prescott Bush, President Bush's grandfather, was helping to fund the Nazis and so you would expect the Bushes and the Farish family to be close. Farish's grandson, William S. Farish III, became a very close friend and associate of Father George and a bosom buddy of the Queen of England. She has visited his Lane's End ranch in Kentucky many times, taking her horses to breed with Farish's prize stallions. She apparently travels by Royal Air Force plane to the Blue Grass Airport in Lexington on these occasions.\" As I said earlier, when Father George Bush became Vice President to Reagan, he had to (officially) hand over his business affairs and investments to a \"blind trust\" and the man chosen to"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 139 run it was the same William S. Farish III, the US Ambassador in London and the middleman in the \"war on terrorism\" between the Bush, Blair, and the Queen. Wherever you look it is clear that what has followed September 11th has been coordinated throughout by the Bush cartel. Tony Blair Since the election of Tony Blair as UK Prime Minister on May 1st 1997, a coup has taken place in Britain. Blair, who should by law be an accountable Prime Minister running the country in cooperation with his cabinet, has become \"President Blair\", running his own agenda in league with unelected \"advisers\". Mo Mowlam was Blair's former Secretary for Northern Ireland and she was the only member of his sycophantic, spineless, bunch of shady main-chancers (his \"cabinet\") that I would trust to tell me the time. After she left the government, she told the BBC documentary, Cabinet Confidential: \"Tony's acting more like a president than a prime minister and in that situation the cabinet itself is dead\". Mowlam suggested that the unelected advisers have more power than the cabinet in relation to the prime minister. \"They seemed to be operating instead of the cabinet,\" she said, and she continued: \"He makes decisions with a small coterie of people, advisers, just like the president of the United States. He doesn't go back to cabinet, he isn't inclusive in terms of other cabinet ministers and if he really wants to get the support of the public and the support of Parliament there has to be more people included.\" 24 As in Nazi Germany, you are not allowed to speak out against Herr Blair. Freedom of speech and having a right to an opinion is only accepted if Blair agrees with what you say. The difference is that in Nazi Germany they assassinated you for challenging the Fuhrer and in Blair's Britain they assassinate your character. Mowlam was \"Our Mo\" when she was in the Blair cabinet and \"Mad Mo\" when she started challenging high command. One of Blair's \"BIGs\" - Buffoons in Government - who has dismissed her in such terms is the punch-throwing and in my view oaf of a Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. Along with Foreign Secretary Jack \"straw man\" Straw, Prescott is perhaps the number one \"BIG\" in the Blair cabinet from where I'm sitting. Blair, in truth, has become a dictator masquerading as a democratic prime minister and since September 11th he has been a law unto himself. The BBC documentary showed how Blair's \"war cabinet\" included his unelected director of communications and strategy, Alistair Campbell, and the newly appointed head of government relations, Sally Morgan. Campbell, a former tabloid journalist, is paid by a Civil Service that is supposed to be politically i mpartial and yet he is a Labour supporter whose role in the Blair circle is to spin news and events to present his \"boss\" in the best light and to get the people to see the world in a way that suits Blair's agenda. None of this is a surprise to me because to my eyes Blair has always had a large notice on his forehead warning: \"Not to be trusted\". I felt this long before he became Prime Minister. I have said in"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"140 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. previous books and talks that he was an Illuminati place man put in power to serve the cause, which included taking the UK into the European single currency, dropping the pound sterling, and absorbing British independence into the European fascist superstate. I wrote that years ago and that is precisely what he is doing, helped by the pathetic Liberal Democrats of Charles Kennedy. Anyone who supports the Euro single currency is supporting their own financial imprisonment by unelected bankers working to the Illuminati agenda for global control. The chosen one Tony Charles Lynton Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 6th 1953. His father, Leo, was a law lecturer at Edinburgh University, a major educational centre for the Illuminati. Blair grew up in the industrial city of Durham, which is most famous for its cathedral, and also lived in Australia for three years. He was educated at the Durham Choristers School before returning to Edinburgh to attend the prestigious (if you like that sort of thing) Fettes College. Blair went on to Oxford University and then took a legal apprenticeship at the chambers of Alexander Irvine, a Queens Counsel and influential in the Labour Party. Blair became a barrister specialising in industrial and employment law, and met his lawyer wife, Cherie, during his apprenticeship. They married in 1980 and have four children, Euan, Nicky, Kathryn and Leo (who, on May 20th 2000, became the first child to be born to a sitting prime minister in 152 years). Blair's brother, William James Lynton Blair QC, also went into law from this \"ordinary family\" and has been a consultant with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1983, Blair was elected to Parliament as the Labour MP for Sedgefield, near Durham in the north- east of England, and began a rapid rise the top. He was given a number of jobs in the Labour shadow cabinet during the long years of Labour opposition to Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government and her successor, John Major, who is now European representative of the Carlyle Group. At some point in the Blair story he clearly became the chosen one for some powerful forces and within 24 hours of the sudden death of the then Labour Party leader John Smith from a heart attack, the whole of the British media had already decided that Blair was his successor. I still think there is more to know about Smith's death. The wave of support for Blair within a Labour Party that had been out of government for so long was fuelled by the media message that here was the only person who could lead them back to Downing Street. Blair was elected leader of the party in July 1994, a year after he had been invited to attend his first meeting of the Illuminati's secretive Bilderberg Group in a hotel at Vouliagment, Greece. Blair took control of the Labour Party at every level and has transformed it into a fiercely centralised dictatorship, a personalised, customised vehicle for his (the Illuminati's) agenda. It has become a vacuum of principle in which Blair's word is law. And Blair is controlled by the shadowy figures that decide what his word will be. With the media propaganda machine behind him, Blair, at 44, became the youngest British Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 when he was elected by a landslide on May 1st 1997. Months earlier I had said in public talks that not"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 141 only would Blair be the next UK prime minister, but that he would be elected on May Ist - an extremely important date in the Illuminati ritual calendar (see The Biggest Secret). In the UK it is the sitting prime minister who decides the date of the general election. In this case that was John \"Carlyle Group\" Major, the Conservative leader. Major chose May 1st. Dancing for Rupert One of Blair's most significant supporters is the major Illuminati media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. His News Corporation has some 800 subsidiaries and owns the UK Times, Sunday Times, and the downmarket tabloids the Sun and News of the World. His holdings also include Sky Global Networks, which owns the satellite television company BSkyB. Murdoch controls Twentieth Century Fox, the Fox TV network, New York Post, and close to 200 newspapers worldwide, to name only some of his holdings. Murdoch had always thrown his UK newspapers behind the Conservative candidate in UK elections, but when Blair became Labour leader, all that suddenly changed. Blair was now his man. This has been incredibly beneficial for Blair and it also ensures access on demand to the UK Prime Minster for Murdoch. It was alleged that after the 1997 election win Blair rang the Bilderberger Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to help Murdoch to expand his empire in Italy by buying into the Mediaset empire. This was owned by another Illuminati media and political front man, the convicted crook Silvio Berlusconi, who became, staggeringly, Italian Prime Minister. Murdoch's daughter, Elisabeth, a News Corporation executive, is a close friend of Blair's long-time spinner Peter Mandelson. One major example of this Blair-Murdoch relationship came in May 2002 when Blair's government announced plans to change the rules on media ownership to allow Murdoch to expand his holdings in Britain against all the principles of media diversity. A year earlier Murdoch visited Blair at Downing Street to \"discuss his concerns over Britain's cross-ownership laws\" .2' These \"concerns\" were related to rules that prevented him from owning a terrestrial television station because his newspapers have a 33% share of the UK market and he also owns the satellite TV network BSkyB. But with all of his newspapers supporting Blair during election campaigns, Murdoch has no problem telling the Prime Minister what to do, and the easing of media regulations means that Murdoch can now buy the terrestrial station Channel 5 if he wishes. Blair also opened the way for corporations outside of Europe to own British television companies. The major ITV network, once owned by many companies in the various regions of the country, will be allowed to become one centrally owned operation. The rules will now permit this network to be bought by Illuminati corporations like Disney and AOL/TimeWarner and it also allows the ITV network and Channel 5 to be owned by the same people. Channel 5 is currently controlled by the Illuminati media giant Bertelsmann, which is reported to have ambitions to dominate the UK commercial television market. Bertelsmann is a Germany-based company whose American printing operation suddenly, without any warning, refused to print my books in early 2002. Something I said chaps?

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. radio station, and newspaper groups can buy radio stations. The rules preventing one radio group owning more than 15% of the market are scrapped. All these changes by Blair are precisely in line with the Illuminati agenda for centralisation of media power. Like I say, Blair is a 100%, wholly owned subsidiary of the Illuminati. We are full of sleaze if you please ... From the moment Blair walked into Downing Street he has slavishly pursued the Illuminati agenda, pressing for further centralisation of the European Union and conceding more and more power to the Brussels bureaucrats over British law and society. He has all along been preparing to replace the pound sterling with the euro as I said in my books back in the 1990s and he has backed every Illuminati military intervention by deploying British forces and supporting the American government at every turn in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and the \"war on terrorism\" in general. He has also showered government jobs and patronage on his friends, supporters and associates in the same way the Bushes do in America. \"Tony's Cronies\" has become a common phrase in British political life. Also like the Bushes, he enjoys massive support from the top business leaders and corporations as the gap between rich and poor (which the Labour Party was formed 100 years ago to close) gets wider and wider under Herr Blair. On May 14th 2001, before Blair won his second term, 58 business leaders wrote a letter to Rupert Murdoch's Times newspaper urging business to support a Blair victory. They were chairmen or chief executives and a number had been knighted or given other \"honours\" by Blair, who has turned the United Kingdom political scene into a mirror of that headquarters of political slush and sleaze, the United States. Indeed Blair insists that he and President Bush think alike . 21 Blair's Downing Street \"Chief of Staff\" Jonathan Powell is supposed to be an i mpartial civil servant who is paid by the taxpayer. Yet he once worked for the Labour Party raising money through \"donations\" from business. Clearly he's still working for the Labour Party, it's just that they aren't paying for him - the people are. The deeply corrupt Enron Corporation donated money to Blair's Labour Party and saw changes unfold in government energy policy that suited their agenda. Blair says the two were not connected. Then there was the bizarre story of Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel tycoon and one of the richest men in Britain. At the end of May 2001, Mr Mittal gave 125,000 to the Labour Party shortly before the general election in which Blair won his second term. After his victory Blair sent a letter to the Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase supporting the takeover of Sidex, its nationalised steel company, by Mr Mittal's firm, LNM. Days later Romania awarded the 300 million sale to Mr Mittal in the face of French competition. Mr Blair said he sent the letter because he was supporting a \"British company\" and not because of the very large cheque Mr Mittal had given his party. This is a lie. Mittal's LNM is a multi-national corporation registered in the Caribbean tax haven of the Dutch Antilles and of the 125,000 people it employees worldwide, fewer than 100 live in the UK! 27 Not only that, but Mr Mittal's empire is in direct competition with British firms that do employ British people. When the story broke, the lies poured out of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • The rest of the gang \t 143 Downing Street as always. They said that Mittal's donation was made after the general election (lie); they said his company was British (lie); that Blair had only signed the letter drafted by the Foreign Office as a matter of routine (lie - the letter was amended and rewritten by Blair's office); they said it was only a letter of congratulation and did not affect the deal (lie - the British Embassy in Bucharest said it was an important factor in clinching the contract). Mittal's wife also gave 5,000 to the constituency fund of Keith Vaz, Blair's former Minister for Europe, who faced a major Parliamentary investigation into his financial activities and behaviour that led to him being suspended from Parliament for a month. I cannot stress it enough - these are the people telling you what happened on September 11th and who was responsible! A website called Red Star Research keeps tabs on the Herr Blair Bunch of special advisers and business leaders that influence government policy and pay the Labour Party bills.\" The cynical nature of Blair and his government was highlighted in May 2002 in a Panorama documentary on BBC television. This revealed how Blair had spent record sums of taxpayers' money on \"government information\" advertisements in the weeks before the general election that gave him a second term. In the 12 months before the election the government was the UK's biggest buyer of advertising with a record £192 million being spent - up 70% on the previous year - and almost half of that money was used between January and March 2001 in the run-up to the election. A record £49 million was spent in the March alone. Government advertising is purchased through a government department called COI Communications, which is supposed to be independent of party politics. The advertising itself is supposed to be used to inform the public about changes in the law and policy. Instead, as Panorama clearly demonstrated, Blair used this taxpayers' money to promote his government in an effort to increase his support at the coming election. What cynical corruption of the system, what contempt for the people he claims to represent. Tony Blair, again like Bush, is one of the most blatantly and transparently insincere politicians I have ever seen in a profession that is largely insincere by reflex action. His \"off the cuff\" remarks are carefully rehearsed and worded - as with his \"spontaneous\" tribute to Princess Diana on the day she was murdered in Paris in 1997 (see The Biggest Secret). It turned out he had been rehearsing the \"spontaneity\" all morning with his spinner Alistair Campbell. You can always tell when Blair has been rehearsing an \"emotional, heartfelt, statesmanlike\" and \"spontaneous\" response because he keeps pausing between words and looking down in the contrived manner of some C- movie actor. Blair also strenuously denied that Diana's death was anything more than an accident, and resisted an independent investigation. Tony two-tongues Journalist John Pilger highlighted a classic example of Blair double-speak when he wrote of ... \"the grotesque hypocrisy of Tony Blair weeping for the children of Dunblane, then sending machine guns that mow down children in East Timor...\" 29 With Blair and his ministers and officials working as the sales and marketing team, Britain is the second biggest exporter of arms in the world (second to guess who?)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"144 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. and the single biggest arms manufacturer on the planet is British Aerospace. These weapons are used by terrorists of all kinds in the Middle East and across the world.' In 1975, Britain sold arms abroad worth $470 million. By 1995 it was 4.7 billion . 31 Ironically, but appropriately in the circumstances, on the morning of September 11th 2001 as those planes were hijacked, a protest was under way in the Docklands area of London against the biggest \"arms fair\" - death and terror market place - yet held in Britain. While Tony Blair was in front of the cameras condemning terrorism, British arms manufacturers were down the road in Docklands seeking to sell weapons for terrorism with the full support of Tony Blair. Nothing captures the cold, calculating, heartless approach of the Blair government better than the case of Jo Moore, the Blair crony and adviser to the former Transport Secretary Stephen Byers. Within an hour of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center, and while the rest of the world looked on in stunned horror, Jo Moore was sending an e-mail to Blair government colleagues saying that the disaster had provided a good opportunity that day to \"bury\" controversial stories they did not want to be publicised. Blair and Byers both had a very public opportunity to stand for common decency in their government by sacking Ms Moore. They refused to do so despite the public outrage that followed, and it was only much later after another storm broke in her department that she was told to go. I'll take no lectures on morality from Tony Blair, thank you very much. What a fantastic cesspit of sleaze, corruption, mass murder, drug running and terrorism we have had to wade through in these last five chapters. And pinch yourself: these are the same honest, fair, just, peace-loving, big-hearted, thoroughly trustworthy characters that have told us what happened on September 11th, who was responsible, and what should happen as a consequence. Somehow, you know, I don't think I'll take their word for it. Imagine being their speechwriter. What a breeze of a job.

J. Edgar Hoover, the most infamous head of the FBI - and he should know! H istory is ablaze with examples of engineered terrorism and war that mirror the events and aftermath of September 11th. I guess if the technique keeps working, why change it? In my other books you will find many of these recounted in detail, but here are some of the problem-reaction-solutions of enormous relevance to the events of September 11th. For those who are new to this information the parallels will be startling. The Oklahoma bomb There was a \"rehearsal\" for what happened on September 11th. It came some six years earlier on April 19th 1995 when a massive bomb, or bombs in truth, destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and 168 people, many of them children at a day care centre, were killed. All the classic features were there: the problem of a \"terrorist attack\" on a US federal building; the villain or \"patsy\" named immediately as Timothy McVeigh; the reaction of understandable outrage from the people as they saw the devastation and believed the government's version of events; and the solution, with a series of measures that removed civil liberties and targeted the so-called Christian Patriot or militia movement that had been having considerable success exposing the global conspiracy in the years before. It was claimed that McVeigh was connected to the militia underground and his alleged accomplice, Terry Nichols, was also portrayed as some white supremacist and racist even though his two marriages had been to a Mexican and a Filipino. McVeigh was executed and Nichols is currently serving a life sentence. \"Anti- terrorism\" bills were rushed through Congress in days and at least some had clearly been written and printed before the bombing. They included all the elements of destroying civil liberties that have been still further extended as a result of 9/11. Within 24 hours of the carnage, President Bill Clinton was calling for \" ...an easing of restrictions on the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement\". Once again this was achieved to an even greater extent after September 11th. 147"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"148 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Clinton also used the bombing to urge the media to ban \"anti-government extremists\" from their papers, screens and microphones, and he attacked the alternative talk radio shows that are designed to give the public a rare opportunity to hear and communicate information that differs from the official line. The bombing was said to have been a response by McVeigh to the murder of men, women and children by the United States government at Waco, Texas, on April 19th 1993. One of the government agencies blamed for Waco was the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), which had offices in the Murrah Building and the official story says that they were the target. In \"response\" to the bombing, one bill' proposed by the Democrat Charles Schumer, now the Senator for New York State, included five-year prison sentences for publicly engaging in \"unseemly speculation\" and publishing or transmitting by wire or electronic means \"baseless conspiracy theories regarding the Federal government of the United States\". Naturally, the government would decide if it was \"baseless\". Schumer had also vehemently dismissed evidence of the mass murder in Waco in a way that beggared belief. His fascist bill never became law, but you watch them try again whenever they think they can succeed. Already the FBI \"Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force\" has issued flyers urging the public to call with information about possible \"terrorists\" within the United States. The flyers say that among the people to watch for are \"'defenders' of the US Constitution against the federal government and UN\"; people who make \"numerous references to the Constitution\"; those who \"attempt to police the police\"; and \"Lone individuals\"? Oklahoma fantasy There is another tell-tale sign with these set-ups and stings, be it Oklahoma, the Kennedy assassination or September 11th. The official story is so full of untruths and glaring contradictions that anyone with half a brain could take it apart. The US government claimed that a fertiliser and fuel oil bomb left by McVeigh in a Ryder truck destroyed the Murrah Building. He was executed by lethal injection on June 11th 2001 and became the first federal execution for 38 years. Actually, I say he was executed; there are those who question even that. Susan Carlson, a reporter for WLS-AM Radio in Chicago, witnessed the \"execution\" at Terre Haute, Indiana, and says that McVeigh \"... appeared to be still breathing or what appeared to be shallow breathing, even after being pronounced dead and his eyes remained open\". 3 McVeigh had said he was micro-chipped while serving in the US forces and to understand, perhaps, why he would not vigorously defend himself when he could not possibly have been responsible for that scale of death and devastation we would need to know what was going on and being said or threatened behind the scenes. Significantly when McVeigh was first arrested he was given a \"mental assessment\" by Louis Jolyon West from the University of California. What the newspaper reports of this did not say is that West is one of the most notorious CIA mind controllers in America, as my books and many others have revealed (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). Another interesting coincidence is that two years before the Oklahoma bomb, Martin Keating, the brother of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Play it again, scam \t 149 Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, wrote a book called The Final Jihad. This was a novel about a terrorist attack on the \"Oklahoma City Building\" by a man called Thomas McVeigh. Keating dedicated the book to the \"Knights of the Secret Circle\". The provable lie The FBI said the Murrah Building was destroyed by a single ammonium nitrate truck bomb in a 20-foot Ryder rental truck parked outside by McVeigh. The problem is that this is provably impossible. You have only got to look at the small crater left where the truck was standing to see that the explosive power could never have brought down the Murrah Building and there are other little details like the fact that while some pillars closer to the truck bomb did not fall, others further away did. Retired Brigadier General Benton K. Partin said from the start that the fuel-fertiliser device in the Ryder truck could not possibly have brought down the Murrah Building. Too many facts, he said, simply didn't add up. Partin is no anti- government \"extremist\", although that was the way he was portrayed in order to discredit his devastating information. He was chairman of the Republican Party in Fairfax County, Virginia, for four years and among a long list of US Air Force appointments he was Commander of the Armament Laboratory, the top research and development facility at Elgin Air Force Base in Florida. During his 31 years of active duty he became a highly acclaimed expert in weapons systems and explosives, and his Air Force and civilian career record is extremely long and i mpressive. Partin's detailed assessment of the bombing has been widely quoted in the alternative media, but virtually ignored in the mainstream even though it destroys the official story. Actually, make that because it destroys the official story. Partin's report, dated July 30th 1995, says that the serious damage and demolition to supporting columns inside the building could only have been caused by devices attached to, or placed within, the columns. It was simply not possible for that to be achieved by an explosion from outside the building. Yes, the truck bomb could have shattered windows and scattered considerable debris, but the laws of physics mean that it could not bring down concrete pillars that distance away. Partin pointed out that \" ...most people fail to appreciate how inefficient a blast is in air and how dramatically its destructive potential drops off just a few feet from the explosion\".' The main columns in the Murrah Building were made to survive pressure of more than 3,000 pounds per square inch. There is no way, as Partin's report points out, for a fuel-fertiliser bomb that far from the building to generate more than a fraction of that pressure. However, Partin says that the fantastic damage to the Murrah Building could have been caused by a total of just 150 pounds of explosive if it was located in the right places on the right support columns . 5 Dr Rodger Raubach, a PhD in physical chemistry and member of the research faculty at Stanford University, said: \"General Partin's assessment is absolutely correct. I don't care if they pulled up a semi-trailer truck with 20 tons of ammonium nitrate; it wouldn't do the damage we saw there.\"' Faced with these facts about the impossibility of a truck bomb causing the damage, the \"McVeigh bomb\" began to miraculously increase in size. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and other"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"150 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. government agencies originally said the bomb contained 1,200 pounds of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO). But, as if by magic, it was to become 4,000 pounds and eventually 4,800. I even heard 7,000 pounds quoted in the media around the time of McVeigh's execution in 2001. But a study by the US Air Force confirmed that even at 4,800 pounds, the story does not make sense: \"It is impossible to ascribe the damage that occurred on April 19th, 1995, to a single truck bomb containing 4,800 pounds ... In fact, the maximum predicted damage of the floor panels of the Murrah federal building is equal to approximately 1% of the total floor area of the building. \"It must be concluded that the damage at the Murrah federal building is not the result of the truck bomb itself, but rather due to other factors such as locally placed charges within the building itself. This report was not presented at McVeigh's trial, together with 4,000 pages of other evidence that the FBI claimed to have \"lost\". The FBI, the same FBI now \"investigating\" 9/11, also interviewed General Partin but did nothing when he showed that the official story was impossible. He sent copies of his detailed engineering analysis, including colour photographs, to every member of Congress and more than 1,000 media organisations. Only a handful of replies came back. They would rather the orchestrators of mass murder remain at large than reveal that the government and its agencies are lying at every turn. Yet people still say to me that if the conspiracy I am exposing were true the media would tell us about it! Researcher J. Orlin Grabbe and others have revealed that a secret Pentagon report on the bombing came to basically the same conclusions as Partin. Grabbe says the Pentagon commissioned nine explosives experts to write reports and accepted two of them as the \"official\" report.' He says he spoke to both experts, but they declined to be interviewed because of \"confidentiality agreements with the Pentagon\". Grabbe says that sources familiar with the Pentagon report told him that the conclusions were the same as those of General Partin, except that the Pentagon report concluded there were demolition charges placed on five columns, not the four suggested by Partin. These findings are not only supported by the science, but by witness accounts. Many said they heard more than one explosion. A 500-page report by the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation Commission said that many witnesses \"have testified to hearing a second bomb\" and that \"explosives experts contend that the extent of the damage to the building could not have resulted from a single truck bomb ...\" 9 The seismographic record at the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) at the University of Oklahoma recorded two \"seismic events\" at the time the Murrah Building was hit and a geophysicist at the OGS, Dr Raymon L. Brown, told New American magazine that the simplest explanation for this was that there were \"two separate explosions\". 10 Witnesses support this. After rescuers arrived on the scene there were many reports of other bombs being found and defused, and the area was evacuated"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Play it again, scam \t L51 several times. Volunteers at the site and television viewers remember how the police and fire authorities warned that another device, or devices, had been found in the rubble. If you watch recordings of stations like KFOR-TV, Channel 9 News, and Channel 4 News from that morning you see the reporters and witnesses talking of other bombs on the site that had not exploded. (You can see this footage in the video 911 - The Road To Tyranny, presented by Alex Jones. It is available through Infowars.com) Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating tells one interviewer: \"Reports that I have is that one device was deactivated, apparently there's another device ...\" A television presenter quotes the FBI as saying that the explosion was caused by a \"very sophisticated device and had to have been done by an explosives expert\". A spokesman for the rescue teams says that they are not able to get into the wreckage to retrieve the injured because of the unexploded bombs still in the building. A reporter with KWTV said that he had just seen a bomb squad truck going towards the Murrah Building to defuse another device. Senator Charles Key's Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee confirmed these reports. It concluded: \"There is sufficient evidence to confirm that law enforcement agencies in Oklahoma City, as well as Washington DC, had sufficient prior knowledge of the impending disaster, yet took minimum measures to avert the bombing. Documents and witnesses support this conclusion.\" The report said there were at least four sightings of other bombs in the building.\" According to police logs and firefighter witnesses, it was the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) that removed these unexploded bombs from the scene. This is the organisation that was supposed to have been McVeigh's target in the official cover story. We were told at different times that other bombs were found, no other bombs were found, and that bombs were found, but they were \"dummies\" used for training by the ATF. Soon all of this was forgotten and the official version of what happened dominated the media. Rubble trouble The rubble from the Murrah Building contained the proof of where the bombs were really located, what they were, and how many there were. All that was required to establish what had happened beyond doubt was for explosives experts to go in and do their analysis. General Partin made this very point and requested that the site be protected so this investigation could take place. He wrote to the Oklahoma Senator Don Nickles and delivered the letter personally to his Washington office and those of some 23 other senators and around 30 congressmen on May 18th 1995. He wrote: \"I am concerned that vital evidence will soon be destroyed with the pending demolition of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. From all the evidence I have seen in the published material, I can say with a high level of confidence that the damage pattern on the reinforced concrete superstructure could not possibly have been attained from the single truck bomb without supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforced column bases. The total incompatibility with a single truck bomb lies in the fact that either some of the columns collapsed that should not have collapsed or some of the columns are still standing that should have collapsed and did not.\" 12"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"152 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Instead of listening to General Partin, the government hired a company called Controlled Demolition to bring down the rest of the building and take the rubble to a private landfill site operated by BFI Waste Systems. Here the remains of the Murrah Building were kept under guard by the Wackenhut Corporation, one of the Illuminati's private armies, which I mentioned earlier in relation to the chemical weapons equipment shipped by Wackenhut to Saddam Hussein before the Gulf War. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company with other FBI associates in 1954, and recruits from the FBI, CIA, and the military have dominated its board. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of Father Bush and has funded his political campaigns along with those of Boy George and Florida governor Jeb Bush. McVeigh's defence team and independent explosives experts were refused access to the rubble that would have revealed all. If that is not the most blatant admission that there is something to hide, I don't know what is. Ironically, on its own website Controlled Demolition says of the Murrah contract: \"When a crime scene involves the detonation of explosives, and the possibility of undetonated materials exist, an experienced contractor is needed to preserve evidence critical to ongoing investigations while dealing with any explosives discovered.\" \" So why was McVeigh's defence not allowed access to any virgin remains to conduct such investigations? Controlled Demolition says it was hired to work at the Murrah Building and instigate a \"timely implosion\" of the ruins. The company says on its website: \"[At the request of] ... the General Services Administration (GSA), and subsequently that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Controlled Demolition Incorporated ( CDI), was able to assist in analysing the integrity of the unstable Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Controlled Demolition's team coordinated with rescue and body retrieval efforts by authorities, salvaged evidence for the FBI's i nvestigation, prepared the building for implosion, and completed the demolition sequence in a continuous work program. Controlled Demolition Incorporated is equipped to work closely with governmental agencies under complex project scenarios that demand professionalism and attention to detail while working under difficult site, political and emotional conditions.\" 14 The company is owned by the Loizeaux family and headed by Mark Loizeaux out of Baltimore, just a short drive from Washington DC. In February 2000, a Federal Grand Jury indicted Mark Loizeaux, Douglas Loizeaux and Controlled Demolition on charges of falsely reporting campaign contributions by asking family members and employees to donate to the campaign of Elijah E. Cummings, a Democrat Representative for Maryland. The Baltimore Sun reported that the illegal contributions allegedly occurred between 1996 and 1998, but the Loizeaux brothers and the company were acquitted in September 2000. Controlled Demolition certainly seems to be well respected by the United States government and its agencies because it has been awarded federal contracts worth billions. Six years after it carried away the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma and"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 153 took it to a safe place guarded by Wackenhut, Controlled Demolition was hired by the government again for an even bigger job ... removing the remains of the World Trade Center. Same old story As with 9/11 the government's version of the Oklahoma bombing is a mass of lies and manipulation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the ATF as it is known, was supposed to be McVeigh's target. How convenient and strange, therefore, that no ATF agents were killed or injured because they were miraculously not in the office that morning. There were no badge-carrying federal agents in the building, only civilian workers.\" When these facts became known, the ATF wheeled out agent Alex McCauley who told of the heroic efforts to help to rescue victims by himself and a fellow agent, who was said to have fallen three floors in an elevator and survived. But Duane James, the building maintenance supervisor, proved technically and logistically that the story was a lie. It was \"pure fantasy\", he said, and the ATF had to retract the story and admit that McCauley was nowhere near the building let alone in it. They will not, however, say where he or any of their other personnel were.\" Federal Judge Wayne Alley was not in his chambers across the street from the Murrah Building either. He told the Oregonian newspaper that he had decided not to go to work that day because \"there had been talk\". He said: \"Let me just say that within the past two or three weeks, information has been disseminated ... that indicated concerns on the part of people who ought to know, that we ought to be a little more careful ... My subjective impression was there was a reason for a dissemination of these concerns.\" 17 In other words, he was warned off and took the advice. Witnesses who spoke with ATF agents at the scene have confirmed this. When asked if any of their men were injured they said they were not in the building because they had been tipped off through their pagers not to go into work that day. Tiffany Bible, a paramedic who was at the Murrah Building within minutes of the blasts, swore in an affidavit that she found the ATF in full combat gear (which apparently takes half an hour to put on) and they said they had been warned not to go to work that day. Why was the bomb squad on site before the bombing? Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost two small children in the bombing, worked constantly and passionately for years to uncover the truth of what happened. They conducted and documented more than 300 hours of interviews, and persuaded people to talk who had remained silent for fear of the consequences. They established beyond question that a heavily armed bomb squad had been in downtown Oklahoma near the Murrah Building that morning before the bombs exploded. Many people saw them, including Oklahoma lawyer Daniel J. Adomitis, who was heading for a charity board meeting at 7.30am, an hour and a half before the explosion:"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"154 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. \"There was this fairly large truck with a trailer behind it. It had a shield on the side of the door that said 'bomb disposal' or 'bomb squad' below it. And I really found that i nteresting. You know, I'd never seen anything like that in person.\" 18 Some parents saw these people in their bomb squad uniforms as they dropped their children off at the day care centre at the Murrah Building, children they would never see alive again. Eventually, after months of denial by the FBI and other government agencies, the Sheriff's Department had to admit that the bomb squad had been there. The Wilburns were bitterly attacked by other bereaved families as they challenged the government story and they were denounced as \"conspiracy theorists\". But in the end other families also became convinced that the authorities had prior knowledge of the bombing - just as they had about 9/11. The Wilburns and many other families filed legal claims against the US government alleging they had \"detailed prior knowledge of the planned bombing of the Murrah Building yet failed to prevent the bombing from taking place\" and claimed that ATF agents were \"alerted not to go to work on April 19th 1995\". 19 A few more little gems about the Oklahoma bombing. In early April, shortly before the attack, a Ryder truck was photographed from the air within the concrete walls of a military compound near Camp Gruber-Braggs, Oklahoma, and you can see these pictures on the Internet.\" Danny Colson, the FBI's director of the terrorist task force, told Time magazine in 1999 that when he heard of the blast he had driven to Oklahoma from his home in Dallas at speeds of 100 miles an hour to support the rescue operation and the \"investigation\". Oops, Danny boy, caught by the round ones there darlin'. Colson checked into the Embassy Suites Hotel in Oklahoma at 12.20am on April 19th ... just 9 hours before the bomb went off.\" Why? The FBI said it found McVeigh's truck rental agency from a vehicle identification number (VIN) on the Ryder truck's rear axle. This axle was somehow found both in the bomb crater (Mayor of Oklahoma press statement) and three blocks away (FBI). Must be one hell of an axle. Wherever it was found, the FBI story is another provable lie. Rear axles of vehicles manufactured in America were not imprinted with a VIN and the Ryder rental company did not add them to the axles either. The FBI also says that McVeigh rented the truck with both his real ID and a false ID. This same FBI had to admit shortly before McVeigh's first scheduled execution that they had withheld 4,304 documents from his defence team and he was given a month-long stay of execution because of this. The FBI's \"star witness\" against McVeigh was Michael Fortier, who admits doing a deal to testify for the prosecution in return for lighter sentences for gun offences. He told the court that he and McVeigh had made themselves familiar with the Murrah Building weeks before the bombing to establish the location of the ATF offices. Well in that case why did McVeigh stop at a gas station in the Ryder truck that morning and ask the way to the building? Why would he do that anyway when he knew he would be recognised and reported after the bombing? In that one moment he connected himself to the Ryder truck and the Murrah Building. Why? If he had spent so much time locating the ATF offices, why did he park the truck on the side of the Murrah Building furthest away from the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 155 ATF section when he could have left it directly underneath? We are also asked to believe - and depressingly many do - that having connected himself with the Ryder truck and the Murrah Building before the bombing by stopping at the gas station, he then proceeded to \"get away\" undetected in a highly visible yellow car travelling at nearly 100 miles an hour with expired licence plates, and that when he was stopped by the police for a traffic violation a man who had just murdered 168 people and maimed hundreds made no attempt to avoid arrest even though he was armed and a highly trained soldier. It's nonsense, of course it is, but these are the people telling us what happened on September 11th, who did it and who we should bomb in retaliation. McVeigh was arrested so conveniently for a traffic offence immediately after the bombing for the same reason that Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in a cinema i mmediately after the Kennedy assassination and Osama bin Laden was named as the culprit after 9 / 11. They are the patsies required by problem-reaction-solution to hide the real orchestrators. Just as 9/11 was a massive version of what happened in Oklahoma, so Oklahoma was a repeat of the Kennedy assassination. Lee Harvey Oswald was a US agent who was placed in the right place at the right time without being told exactly why he was there. He realised this after Kennedy was shot and ran. When he was arrested he said he was a patsy, a stooge, and would have said so in court. That's why he was paraded in public to allow another government agent, Jack Ruby, to shoot him and kill the evidence (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). In the same way, very possibly, McVeigh was a government stooge who parked the Ryder truck without knowing the full story. This would explain why he saw no problem in stopping at the gas station to ask the way to the Murrah building and why he made such a \"getaway\" and offered no resistance to the police officer. McVeigh apparently said that he was not told what the project was really all about and had been trapped, \"framed\", and made a patsy to cover up high-level US government complicity. 22 Father Bush and the Iraqi connection I almost completed a section without mentioning the Bush family, but naturally that couldn't last. It will stagger Americans to learn that at the end of the Gulf War in 1991 President Father George Bush arranged for around 4,000 officers from the military and intelligence agencies of Iraq, mostly from the Republican Guard, to relocate in the United States; 2,000 of these officers became resident in ... Oklahoma. Another 500 went to Lincoln, Nebraska. Father Bush arranged for their funding, housing and employment, and this has been continued by Bill Clinton and Baby Bush. Jayna Davis, a former reporter with NBC affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma, has worked tirelessly since the bombing to uncover the true story. In 1996 the New York Times Company bought her television station and stopped her reports, but she has continued to uncover devastating information. She has established that more than 70 witnesses saw McVeigh with other men and that more than 20 of these sightings involved men with Middle Eastern features. A sketch of a man with \"olive skin\" seen with McVeigh was released by the FBI immediately after the bombing and he"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"156 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. became known as \"John Doe 2\". But the FBI has withheld at least 12 surveillance camera videos showing what happened and who was there that morning, and 1,034 fingerprints taken by the FBI have never been checked . 23 Jayna Davis' lawyer is David Schippers, who led the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton and represents FBI agents who had their investigations into terrorist suspects blocked by their superiors before 9 / 11. Schippers said of the FBI's manipulation of witness evidence relating to Oklahoma: \"Some of these people who gave affidavits were interviewed by the FBI during the course of the investigation. They were interviewed about the second person they saw and the agents tried to make them say that the second person was Nichols. Every single one of these people said absolutely not, it was a Middle Eastern type individual. Now, listen to this, none of those 302s, none of those investigative reports, have ever surfaced.\" 24 Jayna Davis has produced a detailed dossier and interviewed witnesses who have said they will testify that they saw McVeigh with a former Iraqi soldier who lived in Oklahoma City at the time of the bombing. This man surrendered during the Gulf War and was resettled in the United States from a detention camp in Saudi Arabia.\" Immediately after the blast, the FBI put out an All-Points Bulletin for Middle Eastern-looking suspects seen fleeing the scene in a brown Chevrolet pickup with tinted windows and a bug shield.\" As James Patterson, an editorial writer on the Indianapolis Star, remarked: \"Something here doesn't pass the smell test.\" 27 The FBI has refused to release the videotapes collected from surveillance cameras around the Murrah Building because they are \"part of the investigation\" (the traditional excuse), but TV reporter Brad Edwards located a source who had seen parts of them. Edwards presented a reconstruction for viewers on News Channel 4 of what his source claimed to have seen: \"The source said that the tapes show two men inside [the Ryder truck]. One strongly resembling Timothy McVeigh gets out of the driver's side, steps down, he then appears to have dropped something on the step up into the truck. He bends down and appears to pick something up off the step. Then he turns and walks directly across this street towards the General Electric building. All this time John Doe number two is still inside the Ryder truck's cab sitting on the passenger side. Time passes. The surveillance tape i s time-lapse photography. Without knowing exactly the time interval between shots our source can't be sure how long John Doe number two sat in that cab. What was he doing all that time? Then the tape shows John Doe number two getting out of the passenger side of the Ryder truck. Again the tape shows that a bombing witness accurately described what happened next to News Channel 4 ... the tape shows John Doe two getting out, shutting the passenger side door. He steps towards the front of the truck and is momentarily out of the frame of the surveillance camera. But shortly he appears back in frame walking towards the rear of the truck, still on the sidewalk in the front of the Murrah Building.\" 28"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 157 The source said that \"John Doe\" wore a baseball cap, was taller than the man resembling McVeigh, and had an olive complexion. This was supported by many witnesses, including a man interviewed with a blacked-out face and featured in the report by Brad Edwards: \"I was standing in the building and I looked out the window and I seen the Ryder truck and I seen a man get out of the Ryder truck. He was olive complexion and he was ... he had black curly hair. He was wearing a baseball cap but his curls were sticking out of his hat. It was very short in the back but you could still see the curls in his hair. He was not American, he was foreign, you could tell by his skin, his face, and the way his face was ...\" Senator Charles Key, who helped to produce a report on Oklahoma, said his understanding was that there is a video showing McVeigh and John Doe 2 getting out of the Ryder Truck and into another pick up. \"Where is that video ... are we going to get to see it?\" he asks. Er r you must be joking, the FBI replies. Incidentally I was on a radio show in America in May 2002 talking about the way the FBI had refused to release these surveillance camera tapes. A former FBI agent came on the line saying loudly and vehemently that he worked on the case and there were no surveillance tapes. It took a member of the public to come on tell him that not only did the tapes exist, the FBI had admitted this on the national news! In 2001 the FBI said it was not going to release the tapes at all because of \"national security\" (the security of the official lie). When McVeigh went on trial the FBI did not use the tapes in prosecution because they would have destroyed its story. If only McVeigh and no one else had been on the tapes, the world would have seen them within hours of the blast. Rule number one of cover stories: if letting the public see something would support your cover story you let them see it. If the public seeing something would destroy your cover story you don't let them see it. Surveillance cameras are part of the Illuminati system of control, but they are also a problem for them when they carry out their public operations. Therefore we have a clear red flag test on these occasions - are we allowed to see the surveillance camera tapes of the scene in question? There are 17 surveillance cameras working 24 hours a day along the route of the last journey taken by Princess Diana between the Ritz Hotel and the Pont de L'Alma tunnel in Paris. But at that time, of all times, every single one of the 17 cameras was \"not working\" - or so we are told. James Patterson of the Indianapolis Star wrote that critical evidence that several Middle Eastern men may have been connected to the Oklahoma bombing appeared to have been kept from the public by the FBI. He added: \"Officially, the FBI has dismissed the possibility of a John Doe No. 2, an olive-skinned man whose sketch they released immediately after the bombing, or other suspects. But current and former FBI agents in Oklahoma City say they received documents pointing to another person or even a cell of Middle Eastern operatives. At a minimum, Congress should question one former FBI agent who says he obtained 22 affidavits and more than 30 witness statements describing sightings of Middle Easterners with McVeigh.\" 29"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"158 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Hoppy Heidelberg, a prominent Oklahoma horse breeder, was dismissed from the grand jury \"investigating\" the case when he went public with his complaints that the \"investigation\" was a sham. He said he was not allowed to ask for witnesses, even though it was his lawful right, and one of the areas he wanted to explore was the reports of the \"John Doe 2\". He said he was visited by FBI agents brandishing guns who said that if he knew what was good for him he would shut up. Apparently state, local and federal police detained dozens of Middle Eastern men after the bombing as they tried to leave the United States, and these included \"former\" members of the Iraqi Republican Guard. It has been reported that in their possession were bomb-making materials, but President Clinton insisted they were released. David Schippers, the Chief Investigative Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Hearing of Bill Clinton, said that the same team that carried out the Oklahoma bombing also carried out the September 11th attacks. He said that he understood a former Iraqi Republican Guard officer called Al-Hussaini Hussain, who had been mentioned by reporter Jayna Davis as a possible John Doe 2 in her investigations into Oklahoma, later worked at Boston Logan Airport where two of the 9 / 11 flights took off.\" Larry Johnson, a former Deputy Director of the State Department's Office on Counterterrorism, told Fox News the same. He said he believed that Al-Hussaini Hussain was John Doe 2 in Oklahoma and he added: \"The thing that really concerns me relative to 9 / 11 [is that] when he left Oklahoma around 1996 and 1997, he went to work at Logan Airport in Boston. We don't know where he is now.\" 31 Jayna Davis has testified under oath before a grand jury, and in 1997 she attempted to hand over a large part of her evidence to the FBI, but those in control were not interested.\" They have shown a similar lack of interest when offered information about Osama bin Laden, which would have dismantled the official story. Former FBI agent Dan Vogel offered to testify at a hearing of Terry Nichols, the man convicted with McVeigh, that he had received from Jayna Davis 22 affidavits from witnesses who had seen McVeigh with Middle Eastern men in the months, weeks and days before the attack and on the morning it happened. He wanted to testify that he had sent the package to FBI agent Henry C. Gibbons, but the witness statements were not made public. However, Judge Linder ruled that Vogel could not make this devastating testimony because the [In] Justice Department did not want the evidence to be heard and would not authorise the testimony.\" Waco revisited The FBI and the ATF were, with others, responsible for the mass murder of men, women and children at Waco, Texas, on April 19th 1993. If they had something on David Koresh, the leader of the Branch Davidians, they could have arrested him months earlier when he often left the compound. But these people are mentally disturbed and the plan was for a ritual murder by fire. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, who were serious black occultists (see my previous books) chose the same day, April 19th, to burn the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw in 1943. The Nazis torched the ghetto block by block and then flooded and smoke-bombed the sewers when the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Play it again, scam \t 159 Jews tried to use them to escape. What the ATF and FBI did at Waco was virtually identical. According to the occult law followed so slavishly by the Illuminati and their agents, April 19th and 20th are dedicated to their god Baal and demand blood sacrifice. The Columbine High School shooting at Littleton, Colorado, was on April 20th 1999 and also involved the ATF and the FBI; so did Oklahoma - on April 19th. I cannot stress enough the obsession these people have with occult ritual and I explore this in detail in The Biggest Secret. Two brilliant documentaries, Waco: The Rules of Engagement (1997) and Waco: A New Revelation (1999) devastatingly expose the mass murder by the FBI and ATF, and the involvement at the highest levels of the US government.\" The Rules of Engagement won an Emmy for best investigative j ournalism. The follow-up, A New Revelation, is actually narrated by former FBI Special Agent Dr Frederic Whitehurst. It was Dr Whitehurst who exposed the criminal manipulation of evidence and the stunning \"incompetence\" at the FBI crime laboratory. The documentaries reveal how the authorities used \"flash-bang\" devices to start the fire that engulfed the Mount Carmel compound at Waco after filling the compound with high explosives and poisonous gas. The devices were found at all locations where the fires started, but were claimed to have been silencers and gun parts. They also show how \"shape\" charges were placed by military operatives at the top of a concrete walk-in-cooler that became a \"bunker\" where the women and children sought to escape from the lethal concentrations of CS gas. The \"shape\" charges blew a hole in the concrete roof, killed everyone inside, and caused the partial disintegration and fusing together of some of the bodies of the women and children because of the pressure and heat from the blast. Military explosives expert General Benton Partin supports this version of events, and shape charges have also been identified by some researchers in relation to the Murrah Building in Oklahoma and the World Trade Center towers on September 11th. Gene Cullen, a CIA service officer, is among the sources that confirm how Delta Force, the elite (and brain dead) unit of the US military, was at the compound during the \"siege\". Delta Force fired on anyone who tried to flee the compound through the only escape route, and they either died this way or in the inferno. The FBI claims to have tapes of the Davidians planning to set the compound alight, but they have never produced them because they are lying. The FBI, the source of the official story of September 11th, has some very decent, dedicated people working at the foot soldier levels. But the FBI and related agencies are controlled higher up the pyramid by some of the most unbalanced and corrupt people currently resident on planet earth. What was the outcome for the FBI and ATF after Waco? Their funding was increased. After Oklahoma? Same. After September 11th? What do you think? The FBI, like the ATF, is a deeply corrupt organisation - and the FBI is the source through which the official version of September 11th has been sold to the world. The Illuminati elements within the United States government and others, not least the British, have a long and horrendous history of terrorist activity. They often use foreign front men to carry out the attacks, but it is they who plan and orchestrate them. One example occurred on March 8th 1985 when Lebanese intelligence"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"160 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. operatives trained by the Reagan-Bush CIA exploded a car bomb outside a mosque in Beirut to assassinate Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the Shiite Muslim cleric who some believed to be the \"spiritual\" leader of the terrorist group Hezbollah. He survived, but more than 80 worshippers were killed. Robert \"Iran- Contra\" McFarlane, Reagan's National Security Adviser, said that the bombers \"may have been trained by the US, but the individuals who carried it out were rogue operatives\" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack.\" Sure they didn't and, by the way, spaghetti grows on trees. Pearl Harbor George W. Bush called the events of September 11th \"Our Pearl Harbor\" and for once he was right, although not in the way he wanted us to believe. Interestingly, months earlier a blockbuster movie had been released by Hollywood amid massive promotion about this very attack by the Japanese Air Force on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1941. It was the attack that took the United States into the Second World War. To this day popular accounts of history portray President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Bush family relative, as a man who \"strove in vain to ward off war\".' This is yet another gross misrepresentation. Both the Roosevelts and the Delanos are bloodline and I mentioned earlier that his grandfather, Warren Delano, was a major operator in the drug networks operated by the Russell family, the founders of the Skull and Bones Society. Delano also worked in the drugs network of the British government in Asia, China and the Far East in general. When Roosevelt was seeking re-election as president in 1940 he repeated the same mantra: \"... while I am talking to you, mothers and fathers, I give you one more assurance. I have said this before but I shall say it again and again and again; your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars!\"\" He even had the nerve to add that: \"You can therefore nail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth.\"\" This is what people wanted to hear and he was re-elected. Roosevelt, however, an Illuminati stooge to his fingertips, knew that the sons and many daughters of America were going to war again very soon. What he needed was an event of such magnitude that America would go to war while, at the same time, Roosevelt would be cleared of any responsibility for going back on his clear and constantly repeated pledge of the election campaign. The Illuminati plan, long known by Roosevelt, was to engineer an attack on the United States that would so anger public opinion that people would agree to go to war against the aggressor and join the European conflict also. As a member of Woodrow Wilson's administration in the First World War, Roosevelt would have been well schooled in manipulating public opinion with engineered events. In 1939, Senator P. Nye of North Dakota said that he had seen a series of volumes called The Next War. These included one entitled Propaganda in the Next War and these were written before there was any talk of a Second World War. As Senator Nye revealed, the material included the plan for manipulating public opinion into accepting American involvement in another global conflict, which these documents revealed was coming. The propaganda document, which originated in Britain, said:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 161 \"To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat moreover, which will have to be brought home to every citizen, before the Republic again take arms in an external quarrel ... \"The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without much further ado. [My emphasis.] At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great War, they succeeded in embroiling the United States with Germany ... \"Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the Democratic form of government, and our firm resolve to adhere to ... the old Goddess of Democracy.\" 39 Sound familiar in the months since September 11th? The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is an Illuminati front in the United States formed and dominated by the Rockefeller family. It is part of a web that includes the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs. This network is described in detail in And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret. It was the Council on Foreign Relations that devised the plan to antagonise Japan to such a degree that it would attack the United States. At the forefront of this was Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, a founder of the CFR. In his diary he wrote, \"We face the delicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure that Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad overt move.\" 4° The CFR's War and Peace Studies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt suggesting that aid be given to China during her conflict with Japan and that Japanese assets in the US be frozen, a trade embargo imposed and Japan refused access to the Panama Canal. I can recommend an excellent book called Pearl Harbor, The Story of the Secret War, by George Morgenstern, which sets out how the Japanese were goaded into the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941. 41 Roosevelt, an Illuminati bloodline wholly owned by the Council on Foreign Relations, set about provoking Japan into an attack with a number of measures, including the targeting of Japanese oil supplies. For four years before the attack the Roosevelt administration had been intercepting and decoding secret Japanese messages. They knew that the Japanese intended to alert their diplomatic centres around the world of a decision to go to war through a false weather report during the daily Japanese-language short-wave news broadcast. The forecast of \"east wind rain\" indicated war with the United States; \"west wind clear\" would mean a decision to go to war with Britain, and British and Dutch colonies in the east; \"north wind cloudy\" meant war with Russia. As a Congressional investigation heard in 1945, the messages indicating a decision to go to war with the United States and Britain, though not with Russia, were intercepted and decoded on December 3rd 1941 - four days before Pearl Harbor. 42 These messages subsequently went \"missing\" from Navy files. Other"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"162 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. decoded messages gave Roosevelt prior warning of the attack, but the public were not told and nor were the sitting targets in Hawaii. On January 27th 1941, Joseph Grew, the US Ambassador to Tokyo, had written to Roosevelt to say that in the event of war, Pearl Harbor would be the first target.' In all, Roosevelt had information from eight different sources indicating a probable attack.' The historian Robert Stinnett revealed the results of 17 years of research into the Pearl Harbor conspiracy in his book, Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor 45 His research included more than a million documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which show that knowledge of the Japanese plans was kept from commanders in Hawaii - the very same men who were later made scapegoats for what happened. Stinnett uncovered a memo written on October 7th 1940 by Lt Commander Arthur McCollum, who headed the Far East section of US Naval Intelligence. McCollum confirms the policy of systematically provoking the Japanese to attack the United States in order to provide the political and public motivation for the declaration of war. The attack was purely to manipulate American public opinion into agreeing to take part in another Illuminati war that had long been planned, and no one was more duped than the Japanese. They had been tricked into attacking the US both by the Americans and the Germans. The German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, had been pressing the Japanese to attack the United States. On December 6th 1941 Hitler had added to the Japanese resolve by indicating that German forces were about to enter Moscow. On December 8th, the day after Pearl Harbor, the Germans were found to be in retreat from the Russian front. More than 3,000 people were killed at Pearl Harbor, about the same as the official death toll on September 11th, and they were yet more victims of the Illuminati agenda. The day after Pearl Harbor, Allen Dulles, an Illuminati agent, Hitler supporter and cousin to the Rockefellers, was appointed to the staff of the Office of the Coordinator of Information. This later became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and then the CIA. It was he who was sacked by John F. Kennedy as head of the CIA and then served on the Warren Commission to \"investigate\" the JFK assassination. The Pearl Harbor plan worked brilliantly as public opinion reacted exactly as required to the attack on American soil. The United States was involved in another war in Europe and \"our boys\" who, according to Roosevelt, were not going to be sent into another European conflict, were now on their way, many of them to die. Winston Churchill, the Illuminati bloodline Prime Minister in Britain and a relative of Roosevelt and the Bushes, said of the news: \"That is what I have dreamed of, aimed at, and worked for, and now it has come to pass\". 46 He might have added: \"and I always knew it was going to\". The influence on Roosevelt of the Council on Foreign Relations, with its membership throughout the government, banking, commerce, media and military, cannot be overestimated. Roosevelt's son-in-law, Curtis Dall, said: \"For a long time I felt that [Roosevelt] ... had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn't. Most of his thoughts, his political ` ammunition', as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advance by the Council on Foreign Relations - One World Money Group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 163 artillery, he exploded that `ammunition' in the middle of on unsuspecting target, the American people - and thus paid off and retained his internationalist support.\" 4' The Roosevelt mansion on East 65th Street in New York was actually next door to the Council on Foreign Relations and it was a committee known as the Informal Agenda Group, packed with members of the CFR, which wrote the proposal for the United Nations and handed it to Roosevelt who made it public on June 16th 1944 as if he was the architect.' Henry Louis Mencken writes in The American Language 49 that the term \"United Nations\" was first mentioned by Roosevelt in a meeting with Churchill at the White House in December 1941 - the month of Pearl Harbor.\" Some 74 members of the Council on Foreign Relations were in the US delegation at the founding meeting of the United Nations, which was created from the start as a vehicle for eventual world government. The Rockefellers donated the land on which the UN building in Manhattan is built, as they did the site of the headquarters of the earlier League of Nations in Switzerland. This was their first attempt to create a stalking horse for the global centralisation of political power. The Rockefellers were also responsible for the building of two other famous buildings in Manhattan ... the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The Council on Foreign Relations, founded in 1921, has its members in key positions throughout the US government, military, and media today, and many of the people telling us what happened on September 11th and who was responsible are from the ranks of the CFR - just as they were with Pearl Harbor, the Oklahoma bombing and so many other problem-reaction-solutions of the last 80 years. Operation Northwoods In April 2001, just four months before September 11th, a book was published by James Bamford, who was formerly the Washington Investigative Producer for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on ABC Television. It was called Body of Secrets' and revealed a plan hatched 40 years ago by America's top military leaders, the Joints Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, to commit acts of terrorism in US cities, kill civilians and blame it on the Cuban president Fidel Castro. The plan was called Operation Northwoods, and was designed to win public and international support for an invasion of Cuba that would remove Castro. Bamford quotes military leaders as writing: \"We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba\", and \"casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation\". The Joint Chiefs of Staff also proposed to kill the astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbit and blame that on Cuba, the documents reveal. If Glenn's rocket exploded, \"the objective is to provide irrevocable proof ... that the fault lies with the Communists et all Cuba [sic],\" say the Northwood documents. Bamford writes: \" ... the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"164 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. terrorism to be launched in Washington DC, Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phoney evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer [the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and i nternational backing, they needed to launch their war.\" 52 The plan was to stir up so much hatred for Cuba in the United States that the people would support an invasion and even demand that this was done. They intended to explode plastic bombs, arrest Cuban agents and release previously prepared documents falsely substantiating Cuban involvement. The plan included attacks on the now infamous US base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba where, since the invasion of Afghanistan, the \"Land of Freedom\" has kept untried and uncharged \"terrorists\" in disgraceful, inhuman, conditions. These attacks on the base would be blamed on Castro. The documents speak of \"a series of well co-ordinated incidents ... in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces \" . \" A Memorandum of July 27th 1962 says that the operation would mean an enormous increase in Cuban and American casualties.' The techniques to be used included: starting rumours; using clandestine radio; landing friendly Cubans in uniform \"over the fence\" to stage \"attacks\" on the base; capturing (friendly) Cuban saboteurs inside the base; starting riots near the base main gate using friendly Cubans; blowing up ammunition inside the base and starting fires; burning aircraft on the base and blaming Cuba; throwing mortar shells into the base; capturing assault teams approaching from the sea or Guantanamo City; capturing a militia group which storms the base to sabotage a ship in harbour; sinking a ship near the harbour entrance; blowing up an unmanned vessel in Cuban water and blaming it on Cuban aircraft that would naturally come and investigate what had happened; issue false casualty lists to the US media to whip up public opinion against Cuba; and, look at this ... \"conduct funerals for mock victims.\" 55 The Northwoods documents also call for the use of Soviet Union MIG-type lookalike aircraft flown by US pilots to harass civil aircraft, attack surface shipping and destroy US military \"drone\" (remotely controlled) aircraft to give the i mpression it was all done by Communists. \"An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG ...\" one document says.\" It was further planned to stage the mock shooting-down of a US Air Force plane in international waters by simply getting the pilot, using a made-up name, to report that he was under attack and then stop transmitting. He would then fly back to his base where the plane would be repainted with a new tail number and the pilot would resume his real name. A US submarine would send aircraft to search for wreckage in the sea and this would be found to confirm the attack and blame it on Cuba. James Bamford's book is a history of the biggest intelligence operation in America, the National Security Agency (NSA), which makes the CIA look like a whimpering poodle. Bamford says the NSA was not involved in Operation Northwoods, but I don't agree. I don't buy the \"it was just the Pentagon\" line at all. Of course the NSA would be involved in such an operation, as it would have been"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Play it again, scam \t 165 in 9 / 11. Bamford says the plans for these terrorist acts against American targets had the written approval of all the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed by Eisenhower's appointee, Army General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, and were presented by Robert McNamara, the [Illuminati] Defense Secretary, to President Kennedy in March 1962. Eventually the \"civilian leadership\" rejected them and three days later President Kennedy told Lemnitzer there was virtually no chance of ever using overt force to take Cuba. Operation Northwoods remained secret for 40 years until these documents came to light. Bamford told his former employers at ABC News: \"These were Joint Chiefs of Staff documents. The reason these were held secret for so l ong is the Joint Chiefs never wanted to give these up because they were so embarrassing. The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders responding to the public will, and here this is the complete reverse, the military trying to trick the American people into a war that they want but that nobody else wants.\" 57 Why, one is right to wonder, do they allow the public to hear of this these only months before a very similar plan unfolded on September 11th 2001? Bamford writes that even after the original plans were rejected, others continued to be developed, such as creating a war between Cuba and another Latin American country that would allow the US to intervene. It is no good people claiming their leaders could not have been behind the horrors of 9/11 when the documents exist to show that the Pentagon had planned in detail something very similar 40 years ago. And wait for this ... Operation Northwoods also planned the hijacking of civil aircraft. The documents say it was possible to create an incident that would convince the people that the Cuban aircraft had shot down a chartered civil airliner on a flight from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Venezuela or Panama. The destination would be chosen so the route would cross Cuba and the plan was to replace the civil airliner with an identical one remotely controlled from the ground and painted in the same colours. The real plane would be landed at an Air Force base and the passengers, boarded under aliases, would be taken off. The remotely controlled replacement would then be flown over Cuba, send a distress signal and be destroyed by radio signal. And all this was planned 40 years ago. Imagine what the technology is like today by comparison? James Bamford writes in Body of Secrets: \"An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted into a drone [a remotely controlled unmanned aircraft].

The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a \"May Day\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organisation] radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to 'sell' the incident.\" Forty years later, in New York and Washington, something remarkably similar happened on 9/11 and, for Fidel Castro, read Osama bin Laden. Also it was clearly possible 40 years ago for transmissions to be made from an aircraft in which there were no pilots or passengers on board. You can see from these examples, and I could quote so many more, that the problem-reaction-solution techniques that were employed on September 11th are nothing new. Like I say, if it keeps working, why change it?

This becomes obvious when you observe both the attacks and their aftermath. In this chapter I will outline the official story of what happened and the response that followed. I should stress that many of the \"facts\" in this official version depend on which spokesman or agency you speak to because they often contradict each other. The US government and its \"security\" agencies like the CIA and FBI say they had no idea that a terrorist attack was planned on that beautiful east coast morning as tens of thousands of people began their working day in the office complexes of Manhattan and at the headquarters of the American military at the Pentagon in Washington DC. These \"security\" agencies employ together perhaps 100,000 people in the United States and worldwide, and devour some $35 billion from US taxpayers every year (and that's only the official funds). Yet they claim not to have uncovered one single piece of information to suggest that some \"19 Arab terrorists\" (part of a network of perhaps 50, it is suggested) were planning to simultaneously hijack four US commercial aircraft in American airspace and crash them into the very symbols of US military and financial power. The first they knew, so the story goes, was when it was far too late to respond. That is an outrageous lie to be filed with all the rest and has been revealed as such. The Problem At 7.59am that Tuesday morning, American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767, took off from Logan International Airport in Boston heading for Los Angeles. On board were 81 passengers, two pilots and nine flight attendants. Following along the runway soon afterwards was United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, which departed at 8.14am, also for LA. It was carrying 56 passengers, two pilots and seven flight attendants. At 8.01am, and 150 miles to the south, United Airlines Flight 93 169"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"170 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. pulled back from the gate at Newark, New Jersey, and the Boeing 757 began its routine journey across America to San Francisco with 38 passengers, two pilots and five attendants. But for some reason, which United Airlines could not explain when I asked them, the take-off was delayed and it did not leave the ground until 8.42. Meanwhile, at 8.10, American Airlines Flight 77 left Washington's Dulles International Airport for Los Angeles with 58 passengers, two pilots and four attendants aboard a Boeing 757. American Airlines flight 11 Figure 10: th e course of Flight 11 according to aircraft tracking company Flight Explorer The official story claims that shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 took off from Boston at 7.59 bound for Los Angeles, Arab terrorists hijacked the plane using small knives and box cutters. The pilot and co-pilot of Flight 11 were John Ogonowski and Tom McGuinness, a former F-14 Navy Tomcat pilot described as \"big and burly\". Around 14 minutes into the flight they were instructed by air traffic control to make a 20-degree turn to the right, according to a \"federal official familiar with transcripts of the air-traffic-control conversations of all four flights\".' The pilot replied in the normal way of ground to air communications by repeating the instruction and giving the flight code: \"20 right, AAL11\". Very soon after this, the pilot was asked to climb to 35,000 feet, but there was no response. The following is claimed to be a transcript of the exchange that took place at about 8.13am, 14 minutes into the flight: Boston Control Center: \"AAL11 turn 20 degrees right.\" AAL11: \"20 right AAL11.\" Controller A: \"AAL11 now climb maintain FL350 [35,000 feet].\" Controller A: \"AAL11 climb maintain FL350.\" Controller A: \"AAL11 Boston.\" Controller A: \"AAL11, ah, the American on the frequency how do you hear me?\" Controller B breaks in: \"This is Athens.\""},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 171 Controller A: \"This is Boston. I turned American 20 left and I was going to climb him; he will not respond to me now at all.\" Controller B: \"Looks like he's turning right.\" Controller A: \"Yeah, I turned him right.\" Controller B: \"Oh, O.K.\" Controller A: \"And he's only going to, um, I think 29.\" Controller B: \"Sure that's fine.\" Controller A: \"Eh, but I'm not talking to him.\" Controller B: \"He won't answer you. He's nordo [no radar] roger. Thanks.\" 2 So the first sign of a problem that morning was shortly after 8.13am and it is claimed that only at 8.40 - 27 minutes later - did the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inform NORAD, which guards North American airspace, that Flight 11 had been hijacked. Why? We shall see that this is against all procedures detailed in the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon instruction manuals. The FAA is the civilian government operation that runs the air traffic system in the United States while NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, is an American and Canadian military organisation that is supposed to protect North America against attacks by \"aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles ... ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace of Canada and the United States\". 3 I will have a great deal more to say about these organisations in due course. It is claimed that after contact was lost with Flight 11, a controller heard a voice from the cockpit at 8.24am that said: \"We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport. Nobody move.\" The controller is said to have replied: \"Who's trying to call me?\" But there was no response. Another \"radio transmission\" said to have been heard by controllers at 8.33am was: \"Nobody move please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\" Two minutes later another instruction is said to have been: \"Everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.\" If that's true, the pilots had time to switch on the microphone in the cockpit, which, the official version says, allowed air traffic controllers to hear the hijackers. Either that or the hijackers were confusing the aircraft radio with the intercom. Strangely, the secret four-digit alert code that warns the ground that a plane has been hijacked was never sent and that's the first thing a pilot is supposed to do in such circumstances. It was the same story with all four aircraft. There was only one other contact between Flight 11 and air traffic control, the official story goes. That was when controllers were asked for a route, or air corridor, to JFK Airport in New York, although by whom is not stated by officials. I asked the media office of the Federal Aviation Administration who in the cockpit made this request and they said they did not have that information. Why? The transponder, or IFF beacon, which allows an aircraft to be more easily tracked on radar and supplies other information, was switched off at 8.20 over the Hudson River and the plane turned sharply and headed for New York. Losing the transponder would have"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"172 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. made it harder to track the plane, but, I emphasise, it was still very much trackable by conventional radar. \"Attendants call from plane\" We are told that flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney, a 35-year-old mother of two, made a call from the plane to American Airlines Flight Services Manager Michael Woodward at Boston Logan Airport and said there were four hijackers on board (the FBI claims there were five). She said they had stabbed two flight attendants, we are told. She is claimed to have said: \"A hijacker cut the throat of a business class passenger and he appears to be dead.\" The terrorists, Sweeney said, \"had just gained access to the cockpit.\" 4 This begs the question of why the pilots had not sent the hijack code if things were happening on the plane before the hijackers gained access to the cockpit. The FBI report to the media on this alleged conversation says that even as Sweeney was relating details about the hijackers to Woodward, the men were storming the front of the plane. I ask again: if all hell was breaking lose in the plane and passengers were being attacked why no hijack code from the cockpit and why wasn't the cockpit door immediately secured from the inside? According to Woodward, when the plane changed direction and began to descend Sweeney called the cockpit, but there was no reply. Sweeney is said to have told Woodward the seat numbers of the hijackers and that the plane was going down. Her final words were given as: \"I see water and buildings. Oh my God. Oh my God.\" American Airlines later released an account of a conversation it says took place during the flight between attendant Betty Ong and airline officials. They say that Ong pressed number 8 on a seatback GTE Airfone and got through to an American Airlines reservations agent who called the system operations control centre in Fort Worth, Texas. The time was 8.27am, around 12 minutes after the cockpit first failed to respond to air traffic instructions. Craig Marquis, the manager on duty, said that Betty Ong told him that two flight attendants had been stabbed and one was being given oxygen. A passenger had been slashed in the throat and looked dead and the hijackers were in the cockpit. She said that the passengers had been sprayed with something that made her eyes burn and she was having difficulty breathing. She said there were four hijackers (again not the five the FBI claims) and she said they were in the first-class seats, 2A, 2B, 9A, and 9B. These numbers were slightly different to those given by the other attendant, Madeline Amy Sweeney, and both were different to those given by the FBI. I asked the FBI why there was such a discrepancy, but they said they could not answer questions because of the \"ongoing investigation\" and I would have to apply through the Freedom of Information Act in years to come to find the information I wanted! (See Appendix I and 2.) Betty Ong is claimed to have said that the wounded passenger was in seat 10B. Marquis asked Betty Ong if the plane was descending. \"We're starting to descend. We're starting to descend,\" she is said to have replied. At 8.46am, 48 minutes after leaving Boston, Flight 11 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at the 96th of the 110 floors."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 173 The FBI later listed five hijackers on Flight 11, thus ignoring the fact that calls, apparently from two separate flight attendants actually on the flight, both said four. I will use the names and spellings from the indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was accused of involvement in the planning of the attacks. The indictment relates to his appearance before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, in December 2001. Among those named by the FBI as a hijacker of Flight 11 was Mohamed Atta r an Egyptian, who it says was at the controls when the plane struck the World Trade Center. The FBI also claims he was the overall leader of the 9/11 terrorists. The other hijackers on Flight 11 were named on the indictment as Satam al-Suqami, from the United Arab Emirates, and Abdul Alomari, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri, all from Saudi Arabia. Al-Suqami, the FBI tells us, was the only one of the five who was not a trained pilot. United Airlines flight 175 Figure 11: The route of Flight 175 Captain Victor J. Saracini, aged 51, and 38-year-old first officer Michael R. Horrocks were at the controls of Flight 175 when it pushed back from Gate 19 at Boston's Logan Airport. This was seven gates along from Flight 11, which had left from Gate 26 about 15 minutes earlier. The official stories of what happened to the two planes are very similar. Flight 175 took off about 8.14am and nothing seemed amiss in the initial climb. At 8.37, with AA Flight 11 now known to be in trouble, a controller is said to have asked Saracini and Horrocks if they could see American Flight 11 ahead of them. Controller: \"Do you have traffic? Look at, uh, your twelve to one o'clock at about, uh, ten miles south bound to see if you can see an American seventy six seven out there please.\" UAL175: \"Affirmative we have him, uh, he looks, uh, about twenty yeah about twenty nine, twenty eight thousand.\" Controller: \"United 175 turn five turn thirty degrees to the right I [want to] keep you away from this traffic.\" 5"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. We are then told there were no further communications between the ground and Flight 175 until 8.41, that's just five minutes before Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center. At this time one of the pilots on Flight 175 is claimed to have called the controller and said, using the pilot code for Boston: \"We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure from B-O-S. Sounds like someone keyed the mike and said, 'Everyone stay in your seats'.\"' Again I asked the Federal Aviation Administration for more information on this exchange, but they said they could not comment. Just 90 seconds after that exchange between cockpit and controller, Flight 175 veered off-course over northern New Jersey and headed south before turning back in a U-turn towards New York at some 400 miles an hour, aiming for the World Trade Center.' That is just 90 seconds between no problem and the plane being taken over by hijackers and flown off-course? Once again the transponder was switched off and there was no hijack code from the pilots, as with all four aircraft involved. Howard Dulmage, an aviation attorney and pilot, said: \"You think four times in one morning one of those crews would have done that. That means they had to be upon them before they could react.\"' Well that's one way of explaining it, anyway, but there are others. A female flight attendant is said to have spoken to a mechanic at an airline maintenance centre in San Francisco that takes in-flight calls from attendants reporting items that need replacing or repairing. The mechanic, we are told, reported the conversation about 8.50am to Rich \"Doc\" Miles, the manager of the United Airlines System Operations Center in Chicago. He says the mechanic told him that the attendant had said: \"Oh my God. The crew has been killed; a flight attendant has been stabbed. We've been hijacked.\" 9 The line then went dead. If this is all true then, according to the official ti meline, the hijackers stormed the cockpit, killed the crew, took over the controls, a flight attendant rang the airline mechanic, and he called Rich \"Doc\" Miles to report what she said, all in the space of around seven minutes. Messages were sent to the cockpit computer without reply. Passenger Peter Hanson, a software salesman, apparently used his cellphone to ring his parents in Easton, Connecticut, at about gam, some 45 minutes after take-off, and said that hijackers with knives had taken over the plane and stabbed a stewardess. Soon after, he called again and before the line was lost he is said to have told his father Lee that the plane was \"going down\". Hanson's wife Sue, son Peter, and their two-year-old daughter Christine were also on the plane. Around this time, it is claimed, an unidentified stewardess rang an emergency number from the back of the plane and described how colleagues had been stabbed. At 9.03am Flight 175 smashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center on live television amid a fireball that no one who saw it will ever forget. The FBI says the hijackers of Flight 175 were led by Marwan al-Shehhi of the United Arab Emirates, a close friend and associate of Mohamed Atta. FBI statements claim that Al-Shehhi piloted the aircraft into the south tower. Also on the plane, the FBI tells us, were Fayez Ahmed (also Banihammad Fayez) and Mohald al-Shehri, both Saudis who had undergone flight training, and Ahmed al- Ghamdi and Hamza al-Ghamdi, also from Saudi Arabia."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 175 Ame rica n Airlines flig ht 77 Figure 12: The USA Today version of the route of \t Figure 13: The other version of Flight 77 published Flight 77 \t elsewhere in the media In the cockpit that morning as Flight 77 took off from Washington Dulles at 8.20am were 51-year-old Captain Charles F. \"Chic\" Burlingame III and first officer David Charlebois, who was 39. Burlingame was a graduate of the \"Top Gun\" fighter pilot school and was such a perfectionist that one colleague said that he would carry a set of small paint brushes to dust the instruments. He had once worked at the Pentagon while a Navy reservist not far from where his flight would crash that morning. His father was in the Navy and Air Force for 23 years and he and his wife are buried in the Arlington National Cemetery close to the Pentagon. Among the passengers was a former American Airlines pilot called Wilson \"Bud\" Flagg, a retired Navy Admiral once posted to the Pentagon; Brian Jack, a head of fiscal economics in the office of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, where he had worked for 25 years; three engineers from plane makers, Boeing; and Barbara Olson, wife of the US Solicitor General, Theodore \"Ted\" Olson, and a contributor to CNN. Flight Explorer is a company that tracks commercial flights in real time using data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, and can be accessed on the Internet.\" There are, however, two published versions of the route of Flight 77, both sourced to Flight Explorer. The version published in USA Today (Figure 12) includes a very strange \"loop\" deviation from its course as it turned north over West Virginia, then west, before turning south and returning to its authorised route.\" This loop is not included in the course data published by other media organisations, and this serious deviation happened well before the transponder was is said to have been turned off and the plane turned around to head back for Washington. If this did happen, what on earth were the air traffic controllers doing in that time and what was the reason given by the cockpit before the aircraft returned to its agreed route? I asked the Federal Aviation Administration that very question, but it wouldn't comment. I contacted Flight Explorer to ask for confirmation that the USA Today version was correct and I was sent the route in Figure 13. About 8.50am we are told that the cockpit stopped responding to controllers and six minutes later the transponder was turned off. A controller is said to have called the aircraft repeatedly asking: \"American 77 indy radio check, how do you read?\" At 9.02am,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"176 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. still nearly 40 minutes before impact, a controller is said to have told American Airlines: \"We lost track control of the guy, he's in coast track [no transponder] but we haven't - we don't really know where his target is and we can't get a hold of him.\"\" An \"unidentified\" aircraft was then picked up on radar headed for Washington at some 500 miles an hour. Some reports say that a military C130 ( Golfer 06) took off from the Andrews Air Force Base near Washington to identify the plane and reported it was a Boeing 767 (it was a 757) moving low and very fast. This was Flight 77, we are told, with the Pentagon as its target. It is said that one of the terrorists told the passengers that they were going to die and they should phone their families. We are told that former federal prosecutor and CNN contributor Barbara Olson rang her husband, Ted Olson, US Solicitor General, at his office in the Justice Department at about 9.25, according to media reports. Olson says he was watching television coverage of the World Trade Center when his secretary told him: \"Your wife is on the phone.\" Olson said that Barbara, his third wife, told him that her plane had been hijacked using box cutters and knives. She said nothing about the number of hijackers or their nationality.\" There appear to be several published versions of their conversation and in one she said the pilots were with her. Ted Olson told her about the World Trade Center and she said: \"What should I tell the pilot?\" before the line went down. Olson said he called the Justice Department command centre who told him they had no idea the plane had been hijacked. His wife rang back and said the plane was circling, but the line was lost again, he said.\" Olson was the lawyer who argued the case before the Supreme Court for George W. Bush to be elected president after the Florida fiasco and has been a vehement advocate of Bush's anti-terrorism laws since September 11th. On March 17th 2002, Ted Olson was defending the United States before the Supreme Court against charges of murder by the CIA. Olson said that day: \"It's easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government might l egitimately give out false information. It's an unfortunate reality that the issuance of i ncomplete information and even misinformation by government may sometimes be perceived as necessary to protect vital interests.\" By 9.42, some 80 minutes after take-off, Flight 77 was seen approaching Washington DC, it is claimed. The plane is said to have made a sharp turn and descended very steeply from 7,000 feet to near surface level. It is reported to have crossed a highway, clipping street lamps, before striking a helicopter pad and exploding into a five-storey section of the Pentagon, one of the world's biggest buildings, at 9.43. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was in an office at the opposite end of the building to the impact and such is the size of the Pentagon he felt only a \"jarring thing\". A total of 190 people died in the plane and the Pentagon, we are told. The FBI announced to the media that five hijackers were on board Flight 77 led by Hani Hanjour. He had a commercial pilot's license and was said at first to have been at the controls when the plane struck the Pentagon until it was clear from his flight instructors that he was a terrible pilot even in small planes. He"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 17 7 is a Saudi and so were the others named by the FBI as being on the plane. They were Majed Moqed, Salem al-Hamzi, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hamzi. The latter two were the only accused who appeared on the terrorist alert list. United Airlines flight 93 Figure 14: The route of Flight 93 Flight 93 left Gate 17 at Newark International Airport at 8.01am, bound for San Francisco, and took off at 8.42am after a long and unexplained delay. At the controls were the 43-year-old captain Jason Dahl, from Littleton, Colorado, and the 36-year- old first officer LeRoy Homer of Marlton, New Jersey. They flew west over Pennsylvania and into northern Ohio where they received a message from United Airlines warning all pilots of a potential \"cockpit intrusion\". The cockpit of Flight 93 confirmed receipt of the message and because of its late departure this was the only one of the four planes that had prior warning of possible trouble. It is said that Flight 93 was hijacked some 30 minutes after take off, that's around 9.10am, and after the two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center. We are told it was 9.16 when the Federal Aviation Administration told its military colleagues at NORAD that Flight 93 may have been hijacked, but the official story says that it was not until 9.40 that the transponder signal was lost. The hijackers are said to have forced their way into the cockpit wearing red bandanas around their heads and one of them warned he had a bomb attached to his waist. The official version says the hijackers told the passengers they were taking the plane to another airport. Air traffic controllers apparently claim that they heard two short radio transmissions around the time the \"cockpit was stormed\" and in one they heard a pilot say: \"Get out of here\". An unnamed government official quoted in the media said there were at least four radio transmissions in which the phrases \"bomb on board\", \"our demands\" and \"keep quiet\" were heard.\" A lot of these alleged conversations remind me of a low-budget movie. ABC News claimed to have secured a tape of these transmissions in which a hijacker says: \"We'd like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board. And we are going to turn back to the airport. And they had our demands, so please remain quiet.\" 16 Passengers used their cellphones and seat-back phones to call their friends and family, we are told, and they heard about the planes crashing in New York and Washington.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. passengers getting together to challenge the four hijackers, who were armed once again with small knives and box cutters, the official story goes. At 9.45 Todd Beamer, a 32-year-old employee of the computer software company Oracle, is said to have spoken to airphone supervisor Lisa Jefferson after his credit card was refused when he tried to call his family. A summary of the 15-minute conversation was faxed by the Verizon phone company to his wife in which he said that the pilot and co-pilot appeared to be dead and the hijackers were flying the plane. But another passenger, Lauren Grandcolas, is reported to have phoned her husband Jack in San Francisco to say: \"We have been hijacked. They are being kind. I love you.\"\" Beamer is said to have stated that one hijacker was guarding 27 passengers at the back of the aircraft with what he was told was a bomb around his waist. He is reported to have said that two other hijackers were in the cockpit and another was guarding first class. Beamer sent love to his wife, who was five months pregnant, and his two small sons. The last words the phone supervisor is said to have heard him say were: \"Are you guy's ready? Let's roll.\"\" His wife Lisa, who never spoke to him directly, said she recognised the phrase as one he used with their sons. A contact that knows members of the Illuminati High Council in the United States told me that Verizon is a major Illuminati operation. At 9.42 Mark Bingham, a 31- year-old rugby player and an enormous man at six feet five, called his mother Alice Hoglan from the plane. \"Mom, this is Mark Bingham,\" he said, sounding very nervous. \"I want to let you know that I love you. I'm calling from the plane. We've been taken over. There are three men that say they have a bomb.\" 19 The FBI and Beamer said there were four. Jeremy Glick, a former national judo champion, talked to his wife, Liz, on an airphone and asked if it was true about planes crashing into the World Trade Center. He said the passengers were taking a vote over whether they should try to take back the plane. \"Honey, you need to do it,\" she told him. Glick's mother-in-law told CNN that he also called her and said that \"one of the hijackers had a red box he said was a bomb and one had a knife of some nature\".\" She said he asked her if reports about attacks on the World Trade Center were true and she told him they were. He left the phone for a while, she said, returning to say: \"The men voted to attack the terrorists.\" Thomas Burnett Jr, a 38-year-old father of three girls, called from the plane four times and in his last call he told his wife that they planned to challenge the hijackers. \"I know we're all going to die,\" he told her, \"There's three of us who are going to do something about it. I love you, honey.\"\" Flight attendant Sandy Bradshaw called her husband Phil, a US Airways pilot. \"Have you heard what's going on?\" she said. \"My flight has been hijacked. My flight has been hijacked with three guys with knives.\" Note again that the FBI says four, just as it names five for Flight 11 when the attendants were reported to have said four. Sandy said she was in the galley filling jugs with boiling water and she ended: \"Everyone's running to first class. I've got to go. Bye.\" 22 The official version is that passengers attacked the hijackers and the plane smashed into a field at Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 575 miles an hour. The time given for the crash varies considerably. NORAD, the official military defenders of North American airspace, told me it happened at approximately 10.03, many other reports say 10.10, and still"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 179 others 10.37. This last time is some two hours and 38 minutes after the first hijacked plane left Boston. By now thousands of people were dead and the world was in trauma at the unspeakable horror of what had happened. The FBI said the four hijackers on Flight 93 were Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, Ahmed al-Nami, and Ziad Jarrah. Television brought the shocking scenes to hundreds of millions of people as the north tower burned from the collision with Flight 11. Then, 18 minutes later, as people were watching those pictures, Flight 175 careered into the south tower amid an enormous explosion of flame. It is estimated that some 20,000 people could have been working in each of the towers at that time in the morning and the official death toll was a little under three thousand. At 10am, less than an hour after the i mpact from Flight 175, the south tower collapsed as a horrified world looked on. Half an hour later the north tower went the same way. The official explanation for the imploding collapse was that the fuel fire had weakened steel supports and the floors above the impact began to fall, creating an ever more powerful chain reaction as floors crashed upon floors until the whole building fell like some enormous house of cards. Among the dead were 341 fire fighters together with other rescuers who had rushed into the buildings to help and been killed in the sudden collapse. The President and the pet goat story President Bush was in Florida on the morning of September 11th for a long- standing photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School at Sarasota. The official story says that he began the day with a four and a half mile jog, two laps of a golf course on Longboat Key. 23 There are inexplicably conflicting reports of what Bush did that morning and when he knew about the first plane to strike the World Trade Center. I will go into these strange events in Sarasota in some detail later. One of the official reports was that Bush was told about Flight 11 by his White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card on the way to a classroom where he was scheduled to promote his \"education\" policy. 24 The official tale is that Bush went to a private room and spoke on the phone with his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. We are told that at this point the crash of Flight 11 could have been considered just a \"terrible accident\", but this is a lie, as we shall see. After hearing about Flight 11 crashing into the north tower of the World Trade Center, President Bush acted decisively. He went into the classroom to hear children reading a story about a pet goat. Bush entered the classroom at about gam with Education Secretary Ron Paige and Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan. They paused for media photographs and Bush sat down in front of the 18 children from the second grade. As the children read to him he said: \"Really good readers - whew!\" Bush interrupted at one point, saying, \"This must be Sixth Grade.\" 25 This is a guy who has just been told that a commercial airliner has smashed into one of the t wo biggest buildings in America in the heart of downtown New York. Chief of Staff Andrew Card then appeared in the classroom and whispered into Bush's ear to tell him about the crash of the second plane, Flight 175. This was the picture seen all over the world along with headlines like: \"The Moment Bush Knew\". Yet still he"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"180 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. stayed in the classroom listening to children reading about a pet goat. It was only around 9.30 - 26 minutes after hearing of the second crash and some 45 after the first - that Bush reacted. He went into the school library to announce: \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I am going to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\" 26 Those folks? Those folks? Bush's behaviour that morning was, at the very least, criminally inept and incompetent, but it was more than that, as I shall highlight later. Bush was taken to the presidential plane, Air Force One, and it was naturally believed that he would head for Washington at this time of terror and chaos for his country. Instead he embarked on a day-long tour of the skies that included stops at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and the US Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force base in Nebraska. He did not arrive in Washington until 7pm - ten hours after Andrew Card walked into the classroom and told him of the second crash. Even the official story says that Bush did not call Vice President Cheney to put the US military on high alert status until 10 o'clock that morning when he was in Air Force One. Between 9.05am when he was told of the second crash in New York and the moment when he picked up the phone to put the US military on high alert status an astonishing 55 minutes had elapsed. It was in this period that Flight 77 crashed into an unprotected Pentagon. When understandable questions were being asked about Bush's unexplained dash to Louisiana and on to Nebraska after his nation had suffered such a massive terrorist attack, White House spokespeople said that they had received a phone call giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was the next target. Like most of the 9/11 story this turned out to be a solid gold lie and later had to be admitted as such. I have seen reports that Father George Bush was in the White House with Cheney while the attacks were happening 27 and an Air Force source also said that this was true. These reports say that Bush left Washington by private jet at 10am that morning while other air traffic was being grounded. This is not that far from the official story, which says that he and wife Barbara were at the White House the night before and flew out of Washington on the morning of 9/11. Father Bush told CNN that they were flying to St. Paul, Minneapolis, when the first news was flashed to their Secret Service detail about the attacks. Their plane was diverted to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and they were taken to a motel beyond the city limits where they could only follow events on television like everyone else, it is claimed.\" If Father George Bush was not actively involved in events then I have a seafront home in the Gobi Desert. Herr Blair hears the news From the start, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were singing, as always, from the same song sheet. Blair was in Brighton on the south coast of England when the World Trade Center was struck. He was due to make what was"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 181 going to be a difficult and less than well-received speech to trades unionists, but this was cancelled and he headed back by train for London. According to media reports, Blair called his Foreign and Defence Secretaries, Jack Straw and Geoff Hoon. The three agreed, the reports say, to build \"... an international alliance which included the rest of Europe, Muslim nations, China and Russia.\" 29 But why would Blair and his yes-men do this immediately after the American attacks when they should have had no idea who was behind them according to the CIA and FBI? Not even the Americans had officially mentioned any suspects at that stage. We are talking of actions taken immediately after the attacks and Blair is already preparing for what became known as the \"war on terrorism\". Back in London, Blair told a news conference that Britain would stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the United States. This was, in effect, a blank cheque speech, as events were to confirm. In the hours and days that followed, the culprit or \"patsy\" was already being dusted down - Osama bin Laden. His name would be repeated like a mantra by Bush, Powell and Blair until he became guilty, not by evidence, but by constant repetition. During his summer holiday a month before 9 / 11 Blair had read security reports on Osama bin Laden and Islamic fundamentalism, and read parts of the Koran to \"... try and understand aspects of the faith and fathom out whether a justification for terrorism could really be found, as often argued, in its pages\".\" What a coincidence. Once upon a time in fairyland ... The television networks were naming Osama bin Laden as the likely culprit in the hours after the planes struck the World Trade Center and Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, first mentioned that Osama bin Laden was a \"prime suspect\" two days after 9/11. Powell told the media: \"We are looking at those terrorist organisations who have the kind of capacity to conduct the kind of attack that we saw.\" Really? Did he mean the CIA and the Pentagon? No, as it turns out. Asked whether he was referring to Osama bin Laden, he answered: \"Yes.\" Once bin Laden's name was in the ring, the \"evidence\" began to emerge in support of the theory that the attack was carried out by extreme Islamic fundamentalists. An official \"investigation\" was launched by two Bush family gofers: Attorney General John Ashcroft and the two-weeks-in-the-job FBI chief, Robert Mueller. The FBI i mmediately named 19 Arab men as responsible for the hijackings. This was remarkable in itself because this same agency, along with the CIA, had told us it did not have even a glimmer of an idea that the biggest terrorist attack in American history was being put together for months before September 11th and, in Mueller's words, almost certainly years. But now the names and pictures of those involved were suddenly produced. What fantastic detective work! The problem was, as we shall discuss later, that more than a third of the names on the FBI \"hijacker\" list were found to be still alive! Maybe they parachuted just before impact? Anything becomes possible when the official story needs propping up. The \"biggest investigation in American history\" with 4,000 officers and 3,000 support personnel apparently deployed by the FBI alone was helped by some staggering good fortune. This included the fact that the bag of \"mastermind\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"182 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Mohamed Atta failed to make it on to Flight 11 and this presented the FBI with \"incriminating evidence\" together with the contents of abandoned hire cars in airport car parks. The FBI said it found a Saudi passport, an international driver's license, a copy of the Koran, \"some kind of religious tape\", and, yes, yes, a videotape on how to fly Boeing 757s and 747s. 31 What a piece of luck. But even this was eclipsed by the miraculous find, widely reported in the media, of a passport from one of the hijackers that was discovered in the street a few blocks from the World Trade Center. Somehow, while some two thousand bodies have never been found, a paper passport that had been in the pocket or bag of a hijacker had survived the impact of a commercial airliner at some 400 miles an hour and the fireball that followed. It had fallen from the plane and wafted down to be found, still recognisable and identifiable, in the street. If that is possible, maybe the still- alive hijackers did parachute after all. We were also told, again despite two thousand bodies disappearing without trace, that a stewardess with her hands tied behind her back was discovered soon after the attacks - just as the official story was being heavily promoted.\" The Reaction These miracle finds and the constant repetition of the official story served to support the script to which Bush, Blair and their \"teams\" were all working. Arab hijackers had stormed the cockpits, the trained pilots among them had taken over the controls, and the planes were deliberately aimed at their targets in a mass suicide and murder attack on America. What's more, the hijackers were working for Osama bin Laden who was based in Afghanistan and protected by the Taliban regime. Once this cover story was established immediately after September 11th nothing was allowed to challenge its supremacy. This is how it was and this is how it is. End of story. If you question anything we tell you then clearly you are supporting terrorism. Or, as Bush put it: \"You are either with us or against us.\" (Roughly translated that means: \"You either don't have a brain or you do.\") This was the story parroted hour after hour, week after week, by the mainstream media across the world. The media is a megaphone for the official version of events. Official sources tell the media what happened and the media repeat this slavishly and call it \"news\". The BBC and its like, for example, reported the \"hijacker passport\" story without any reference to the fact that it was clearly ridiculous. No, really, the FBI told us, so it must be true. Timothy Lee Harvey bin Laden Colin Powell attended a meeting of the National Security Council at the White House after 9 / 11 and it was agreed that he, Bush and deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage would work to build an \"international consensus\" against terrorism. What a trio to lead the world in a moral crusade against those who pursue crimes against humanity! Pinch me, please. The message was: Osama bin Laden is the Mr Big behind 9 / 11 and as the Taliban are protecting him in Afghanistan they would have to be removed as well if they did not hand him over."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 183 By Tony Blair's own admission, no evidence whatsoever was produced that would have stood the test of a courtroom. But that mattered not. Bush, Blair, and their handlers and henchmen had decided that was the story and that was the end of it. When the Taliban asked for evidence against bin Laden before handing him over, Bush replied: \"They are harbouring a terrorist and they need to hand him over. There's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty.\" 33 What a perfect summary of the arrogant dictatorship that runs America and the wider world. Don't do as I do, do as I say. Powell and Blair embarked on their \"whirlwind diplomacy\" to gather support for the Anglo-American \"war on terrorism\". This \"diplomacy\", as usual, involved telling their hosts around the world about the consequences for them and their countries of not doing what was demanded. Powell publicly warned Pakistan: \"... as we gather information and as we look at possible sources of the attack, it would be useful to point out to the Pakistani leadership at every level that we are looking for and expecting their fullest cooperation and their help and support \" . ' Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf knew the score and Pakistan's military dictatorship, with a horrendous record of supporting terrorist groups, joined the \"war on terrorism\". This involved handing over decision-making to Bush, Powell and the rest of American government mafia, but then that was no problem for the Pakistan authorities and their intelligence network because that is a branch of the CIA anyway. Musharraf \"won\" five more years in office in a \"referendum\" in late April 2002, which was described by the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan as a \"humiliating fraud \" . 35 Obviously they moved the gang in from Florida to ensure the right result. Terrorists \"fight\" terrorism The criteria for joining the anti-terrorism \"coalition\" was not your record of supporting terrorism because on that basis the United States and Britain would have been denied membership before anyone. No, the criteria was: will you do what the United States and Britain tell you to do? If yes, you're in and against terrorism; if no, you are a supporter of terrorism. These guys really are the bullies of the world. They had the nerve to wheel out the \"first ladies\", Laura Bush and Cherie Blair, within 24 hours of each other to condemn the Taliban for their treatment of women. Yes, the Taliban's sick ideology was horrible, but not a word was said about the appalling treatment of women by Saudi Arabia, where I lived for some months in the late 1970s. The difference between the condemnation of the Taliban and the silence about Saudi Arabia was simply that the Taliban was the target to be demonised to justify the invasion of Afghanistan while the Saudis who j oined the \"war on terrorism\" are an arm of the United States and the Carlyle Group of Daddy Bush, Baker and Carlucci. This is the peace-loving, justice-supporting, Saudi Arabia that is the home of Osama bin Laden and much of his funding; the Saudi Arabia that conducts a terrorist war against its own people to keep the tyrants and hypocrites in the Saudi \"royal\" family in power as poodles of the US government; and the Saudi Arabia that continues to chop off people's heads and hands according to their Nazi religious \"law\". Saudi Arabia is controlled by a"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. deeply disturbed terrorist regime - the \"royal\" dictatorship - and hypocrisy rules, OK? This becomes even more blatant when you consider that it was Saudi and US support that underpinned the Taliban. Who are the \"advisers\" to the Saudi royal family? Father George's Carlyle Group. Who are very close to the \"royal\" House of Saud? The bin Laden family. Who owned the National Commercial Bank the Saudi royal family uses to conduct its business affairs? Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder of Bush family businesses, 20% shareholder in the BCCI, and named by the US government as a funder of Osama bin Laden. Who controls that bank now? Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, a close business associate of bin Mahfouz, and another man named as a funder of Osama bin Laden's network. What was the bank named by the US government as a source of the funding for bin Laden? The National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Who were part of the consortium with Unocal to build the pipelines across Afghanistan? Delta (Al-Amoudi) and Nimir (bin Mahfouz). No wonder Saudi Arabia was considered one of the good guys by Bush and Blair while the Taliban were condemned and bombed into oblivion. I think, however, that demonising Saudi Arabia to advance the agenda may be part of the plan also sometime in the future. Everyone and everything is expendable to these people when it suits the agenda. Secretary of State Colin Powell, reading from the script, pledged \"to make sure that we go after terrorism and get it by its branch and root\".' That did not, of course, include his own involvement in terrorist activity on behalf of the United States government or anyone who took orders from that government. Sanctions against Pakistan in response to its nuclear weapons programme were removed by President Bush when the Pakistani leadership agreed to play ball. Funny how Pakistan and India having nuclear weapons was so dangerous that sanctions were i mposed, but suddenly, when they agreed to follow orders from Bush and his masters after 9/11, that \"nuclear threat\" immediately diminished. The next thing you know they are both threatening to use them against each other. But what arrogance to say that the US and Britain can have nuclear weapons by right, but any lesser political and economic power must not. NATO and the United Nations also played their parts in the 9/11 movie. The UN Security Council has only five permanent members - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia. These five have the power of veto over \"substantive issues\". The Security Council has, in truth, been dominated by Britain and America, so naturally it would follow the party line after September 11th with a call for \"all necessary means\" to be used to overcome the threat of terrorism. NATO rolled over and purred, not least because the NATO Secretary General was Lord Robertson, a close associate of Tony Blair and his former Secretary of Defence. Like Blair, Robertson attends meetings of the Illuminati's Bilderberg Group and was invited to the one at Turnberry in Scotland shortly before being named Secretary General of NATO in 1999. The last six heads of NATO have been from the Bilderberg Group. The day after September 11th, the 19-member NATO Council, \"encouraged\" by Robertson, invoked for the first time Article Five of its founding charter. This says that an attack on one member is an attack on all of them. Clearly copies of the script had been widely distributed."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 185 Puppet parliaments Both Houses of Congress authorised Bush to \"use all necessary and appropriate force\" against those responsible, including any nations supporting them, and the UK parliament gave Blair similar unquestioned backing to do the same (when he even bothered to ask). This meant that within days of the attacks the Bush-Blair Illuminati- serving Axis of Evil (the real one) had all it needed to wage a war that had been years in the planning. While both the US and UK governments had long failed the poor, homeless, and deprived through a \"lack of money to do everything we would like\", suddenly, as with all wars, money was no object. Funny how there is a shortage of money to keep people alive and help them achieve a decent quality of life, but there is never a shortage of funds to spend on killing and maiming them. There is a simple reason for this: when there is something the Illuminati want to happen to advance their agenda, the Illuminati produce the funds to make happen. Congress i mmediately sanctioned $40 billion for the \"war on terrorism\" and within months Bush announced a $48 billion increase in defence spending to \"fight the war on terror\". This was an increase of almost 15%, the biggest in 20 years, and it brought U.S military spending to $379 billion. The money has been assigned, so we are told, to salary increases for military personnel (dictators always look after their soldiers) and the latest precision weapons, missile defences, unmanned vehicles and high-tech equipment for ground troops. A large chunk will also go to \"homeland defence\" (control of the people) and Bush called for the hiring of 30,000 airport security workers and an extra 300 FBI agents - an FBI which, with 4,000 operatives already, did not, we are told officially, have the slightest clue that the biggest terrorist attack in history had been in the planning for years. The CIA budget is also due to increase by an estimated $1.5 billion or $2 billion by 2003, although we can't know the true figure because the CIA budget is classified . 37 \"I have a responsibility to prepare the nation for all that lies ahead,\" Bush said. He was right, too. A responsibility to the Illuminati hierarchy to prepare the nation for what they have already planned will lie ahead. Forever John Wayne President Bush, like Reagan and all American leaders, has a massive built-in advantage in his pursuit of a dictatorship at home and mass murder abroad. It is the collective mind of America. Individually Americans are overwhelmingly wonderful people and a joy to know and be with. They are almost always helpful, kind, and friendly. But the collective mind, the national mind if you like, can be barely one- dimensional when it falls for the manipulations of its government. There is a part of the American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. It sees only good guys and bad guys, cowboys and Indians, black and white. Many Americans (though it is changing) see the world in these terms and their access to foreign news and events is so sparse and slanted in the US media that they have virtually no idea what is happening beyond the American borders, or even inside them come to that. Instead they let their leaders tell them what is happening and they are sold a fantasy based on the cliched script of a movie starring John Wayne or Sylvester Stallone.

Bush's speechwriters targeted exactly this response after 9/11 by providing quotes like: \"I can hear you and the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" Get on yer horse Big Jaaahn. This planet ain't big enough for the both of us. The Rambo response - no subtleties, no shades of grey, shoot first and ask no questions - is used to manipulate the emotions of the American psyche and to activate macho man and macho woman. Mainstream radio talk show hosts are classic expressions of this with their mindless calls to \"nuke 'em\" whenever the bullies in government pick yet another fight with a country that has no means of credible defence. Among the public responses quoted in the media in the aftermath of September 11th was that of Joan Renshaw, a grandmother in Atlanta: \"I'm angry. I'm hoping we wipe these people out, and if we need to, wipe out the country that is hosting them. Just get rid of them all.\"' Then there was Phil Beckwith, a former Navy Chief Petty Officer from Wyoming: \"I know just what to do with these Arab people. We have to find them, kill them, wrap them in pigskin and bury them. That way they will never go to heaven. Bury Osama bin Laden with a pigskin, donate blood for the people in New York and God bless this great country.\" 39 We have the same collective mentality in Britain, although there appears to be a much greater outbreak of scepticism here among the general public. Calls in America and elsewhere for a peaceful response to September 11th were lost in the clamour and lust for revenge. One banner encapsulated the situation when it said, \"An Eye for An Eye Makes the World Blind\". But such sentiments were dismissed as weak and cowardly, or even, as support for the terrorists. Add all these political and public responses together and it meant only one thing: thousands of civilians in Afghanistan who had never seen Osama bin Laden, including children who had never even heard of him, were now doomed to die from bombs dropped on their already devastated settlements by the forces of \"freedom\" and \"justice\". The Solution \"War\" with Afghanistan As in Iraq, the \"real men\" of the American and British Air Forces bravely flew out of range of the ancient technology that passed for the Afghanistan air defences while dropping state-of-the-art bombs and missiles on civilians. Once again this was not a war; that needs two sides. This was the playground bully at work, and it was just another cold-blooded slaughter. The US government bought the rights to all satellite images of Afghanistan before the bombing started in. order to hide where their bombs were really being targeted. The following are some of the reports of civilian deaths that were made public. The vast majority were not. • \t October 11th: Two US jets bombed the mountain village of Karam. The death toll was estimated at between 100 and 160."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 187 • \t October 13th: Bombs fell on the Qua Meer Abas neighbourhood, two kilometres south of Kabul airport. Four civilians were reportedly killed. • \t October 18th: 47 civilians were said to have been killed when a central marketplace near Kandahar was bombed. • October 23rd: More than 90 civilians were reportedly killed when low-flying US gun ships fired on the farming villages of Bori Chokar and Chowkar-karez, north of Kandahar. • \t October 31st: An F-18 attacked a Red Crescent clinic in a pre-dawn raid killing between 15 and 25 people. • \t November 10th: Villages in the Khakrez district were reportedly bombed, killing more than 150 civilians.\" On that terrible morning of September 11th 2001 it is estimated that 2,998 civilians died in New York, Washington and the crash of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. They called it the worst terrorist attack in history. Yet a study by Professor Marc Herold of the University of New Hampshire concluded that between October 7th and December 7th 2001 at least 3,800 Afghanistan civilians (men, women, and children with no connection whatsoever to 9/11) died from American and British attacks. This figure was a \"very, very conservative estimate,\" Professor Herold said. \"I think that a much more realistic figure would be around 5,000,\" he suggested, \"You know for Afghanistan, 3,700 to 5,000 is a really substantial number.\" 41 Professor Herold's figures were based only on deaths reported in the mainstream media and did not include those in remote areas of Afghanistan and those unreported in the press (God only knows how many that would be). Nor does the figure include those who died because the air strikes prevented their access to hospitals, food or electricity, or those who were injured and died later. Add together all of the Afghan civilians who died as a result of the US-British bombardment and you will have a figure of many, many, thousands more than those who died on September 11th. If 9/11 was the \"worst terrorist act in history\" what does that make the attacks on civilians in Afghanistan, never mind Iraq? They said that what happened in America was \"evil\" and then responded by killing even more civilians in a far-away country. In the newspeak of the Illuminati they called this mass murder of the innocent \"Operation Infinite Justice\" and then \"Operation Enduring Freedom\". A group of Americans who lost relatives in the attacks of September 11th showed more humanity and understanding in one day than Bush has shown since he first came under his father's spell. They flew to Kabul to meet Afghans who lost members of their own families in the Bush- Blair bombing. Derrill Bodley, a music professor from California, lost his 20-year-old daughter Deora, who was on United Airlines Flight 93, which went down in Pennsylvania.

The voice I see in the vast majority of Americans I meet once they have stopped, taken a breath and cleared their minds of their government's propaganda and life-long conditioning. Massacre in the moonlight As I cannot say too often, those who claim to lead America have no love for their country or their people. Whether the dead are Americans or Afghans or Iraqis makes no difference to the Illuminati. They see them as the same cattle, the same cannon fodder, on the road to global control. One of the few news reports to tell any truth about the calculated attacks on Afghan civilians was written by Catherine Philip in the Weekend Australian of November 3rd-4th 2001. Filing from Quetta in Pakistan, she told a chilling story of what so many Afghan villagers experienced. Under the headline \"Massacre in the Moonlight - Alarm of a Different Kind\", she reported: \" When Zamina Ahmed was awakened by the warplanes roaring overhead and heard the deafening boom of a bomb dropping close by, her first thought was to get out of the house. Grabbing her son, Sabir, 5, she ran into the courtyard of the sprawling family compound, searching for a safe place to hide. \"Behind her in the house, her daughter, Shaida, 14, cowered in her bed, too terrified to run. As the door banged shut, she heard the deafening rattle of gunfire from the sky. She looked out of the glassless window in time to see her mother slump lifeless to the ground. 'The moon was shining and in the light, I saw her fall to the ground with Sabir still in her arms,' Shaida said. 'I knew she had been shot'. \"Naseer Mohammed, 20, and his niece, Najia, 14, had nearly made it out of the compound when the bullets started raining down. One bullet caught Najia squarely in the chest, killing her instantly. Mr Mohammed ran on to find cover, leaving her body sprawled on the dusty ground. \"Hiding in the entrance to a nearby cave, he watched as the gunships - believed to be American AC130s, deployed to hunt down and kill Taliban forces and terrorists from the al-Qaeda network - circled over the village firing repeatedly at the people as they fled their homes. \"' When they dropped the first bomb, everyone ran out and then they began firing on the people,' Mr Mohammed said. 'I was very frightened and confused. I wondered why are they doing this to us.' The attack lasted an hour. By the time it was over, 18 members of the family were dead, five of them children. All were killed by gunfire after they ran i nto the open. \"'Just because I hid in a room, I am alive,' Shaida said. 'Those who ran into the yard were killed.' Survivors arriving across the border in Quetta, Pakistan, say as many as 17 other civilians died in the attack on Chowkar Karez village on the evening of October"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 189 22, bringing the total of dead to 35. The accounts they give of the attack are strikingly consistent. Without exception, they say the first bomb was dropped around 11pm, that most people immediately ran outside in fear and were then mown down by gunfire from the circling gunships. 'They were huge planes,' Mr Mohammed said. 'If the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are the targets then why were they shooting at us?' \" Whatever happened in Chowkar Karez, it does not appear to be a simple case of a bomb going astray. The gunners who strafed the village clearly believed that there was something there that they had to destroy. On the night of October 23, the day after the first attack, the planes returned, circling overhead and firing into the houses. That ti me, the people stayed inside. In the morning, they left. None of the villagers seem sure if they would return. For those who survived, the wounds go as deep as shrapnel.\" 43 This is just another every-day story of America and Britain making war on terrorism. It was Iraq revisited with many more like it destined to come until the people of this world emerge from their comatose state. Andrew Gumbel, writing in the UK Independent of November 3rd, also reported the massacre of Chowkar Karez. He wrote that \"Western journalists and human rights organisations published the clearest evidence yet of mass civilian casualties caused by the American bombing campaign yesterday\". He went on: \"Visiting journalists counted 18 fresh graves but were told the villagers had not been able to sort out the many severed limbs and body parts to give each person their own final resting place. 'As we buried the dead, the planes came again,' said an old farmer called Mangal, who claimed to have lost 30 relatives including 12 women and 14 children. 'We had to work quickly. Not everyone got their own grave' ...\" 44 The Pentagon confirmed that an AC-130 Spectre gunship attacked the village (several were involved, not only one, the villagers said), but a spokesman claimed it was a \"legitimate target\". However, anything is deemed a legitimate target to these disturbed people. \"There was a positively identified Taliban encampment, which included al-Qa'ida collaborators, in the vicinity of Chowkar that was struck in October,\" a Pentagon parrot told the Washington Post. \"The encampment was fully developed and was a legitimate military target under the law of armed conflict.\" 45 The same law, I take it, that says that those who defend themselves against such attacks from a foreign aggressor cannot be called prisoners of war because they weren't wearing uniforms. In other words, America's law, Britain's law, Illuminati law, which constantly changes to fit the moment and has no regard for life. Intellectual prostitutes The reports of Afghan casualties and the targeting of civilians I have featured here are rare because of the media management orchestrated through the political and military network and the Illuminati-owned media like CNN, a subsidiary of AOL-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"190 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Time Warner. The New York-based organisation called FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting) 46 highlighted the extraordinary comments by Walter Isaacson, the chairman of CNN or, as I call it, Claptrap No News or the Criminal News Network. As reported by the Washington Post,\" Isaacson \" ... ordered his staff to balance i mages of civilian devastation in Afghan cities with reminders that the Taliban harbors murderous terrorists, saying it 'seems perverse to focus too much on the casualties or hardship in Afghanistan'.\" Isaacson had the nerve to tell the Washington Post: \"I want to make sure we're not used as a propaganda platform.\"\" No kidding. These guys have no shame. Howard Kurtz, the Post's media reporter, quoted a memo from Isaacson to CNN's international correspondents that admonished reporters covering civilian deaths not to \"forget it is that country's leaders who are responsible for the situation Afghanistan is now in\". He suggested that journalists should put the responsibility for civilian deaths with the Taliban, not the American military. Kurtz also quoted a memo from Rick Davis, CNN's head of \"standards\" and practices, which recommended the following sample comments for news presenters to say after reports of Afghan civilian casualties: \" We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this from Taliban-controlled areas, that these US military actions are in response to a terrorist attack that killed close to 5,000 i nnocent people in the US' or, 'We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this, that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan continues to harbor terrorists who have praised the September 11 attacks that killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US' or 'The Pentagon has repeatedly stressed that it is trying to minimize civilian casualties in Afghanistan, even as the Taliban regime continues to harbor terrorists who are connected to the September 11 attacks that claimed thousands of innocent lives in the US\"' 49 Davis added that \"even though it may start sounding rote, it is important that we make this point each time\". During its US broadcasts CNN \"quickly switched to the rubble of the World Trade Center\" after showing images of the damage in Kandahar and the news anchor \"reminded viewers of the deaths of as many as 5,000 people whose biggest crime was going to work and getting there on time\".s° So what was the biggest crime of Afghan children then? Appalling as CNN may be, this outrageous manipulation of news can be found all over the world. The New York Times reported that such policies were being implemented at other television networks. \"In the United States television images of Afghan bombing victims are fleeting, cushioned between anchors or American officials explaining that such sights are only one side of the story\", the New York Times said.\" While the mainstream media spews out the official story of 9 / 11 those who question or expose it are virtually denied access. Investigator Mike Ruppert had his scheduled appearance on the Murdoch Fox channel cancelled at the last minute in May 2002. The Geraldo Rivera programme said that there was no time for him because the New York Times was breaking a story of newly intercepted communications from al- Qaeda that suggested another attack was imminent. Well how come they didn't intercept communications before 9 / 11 then? Of course the reason for the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 191 cancellation was that someone higher up said no. The same has happened to me when presenters and reporters have asked me to appear and then the invitation is withdrawn close to airtime accompanied by one of those \"Er, urn, er,\" stuttering \"explanations\" that insult the intelligence. How does anyone believe the media is going to tell us the truth when the very forces that are desperate to deny us the truth own the press and broadcasting? The three major US television networks, CBS, NBC and ABC, are an excellent case in point. The giant Westinghouse owns CBS, and NBC is controlled by General Electric. These are both companies that make a fortune from wars and the Illuminati agenda as a whole. In 1996 Disney bought ABC. This has been an Illuminati operation since Mickey Mouse and is constantly named in relation to mind-control programmes (see The Biggest Secret). The \"Watergate\" journalist Carl Bernstein has written that hundreds of prominent US media owners and journalists have knowingly worked for the CIA, including William Paley of CBS, Arthur Sulzberger of the New York Times, Henry Luce of Time-Life, William Buckley of the National Review, and Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post. 52 Journalist Deborah Davis also reveals the CIA-media connection in her book, Katherine the Great, an investigation into the long-time publisher of the Washington Post, the late Katherine Graham.\" The book was apparently \"pulled from bookstores and pulped\" after objections from Graham, but Davis took her publishers to court for censorship and won. It was republished with Sheridan Square Press in 1991. 5 ' Davis writes that by the 1950s the CIA \"owned respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, and other communications vehicles, plus at least four to six hundred reporters, according to a CIA analyst.\" 55 What must it be today? As Robert Lederman, a New York writer, artist and campaigner, put it: \"The media is not influenced by the CIA - the media is the CIA.\" 51 A man behind this media takeover was Frank Wisner, who orchestrated Project Paperclip, the CIA operation that arranged for a long list of Nazis to escape from Germany at the end of the war to continue their work for the Illuminati in the United States, South America and elsewhere. If the media is telling you something it is because that is what the authorities want you to believe. As someone once said in a television drama: \"A lie can go around the world before the truth has got its boots on.\" This is possible because of media owners like Katherine Graham, publisher of the Washington Post and a member of the Illuminati's Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission. She said in a speech at CIA headquarters in 1988: \" We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldn't. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets, and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows.\" 57 This is the mentality that is telling you what happened on September 11th, who was responsible, and what should happen as a result. These are also the people who are \"reporting\" the wars and giving you the government propaganda to justify them. Comforting, isn't it?"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"192 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Bye, bye freedom Across the world, the deaths of those 3,000 Americans and citizens of 80 nations have been used to promote the destruction of basic freedoms. Even when I was in New Zealand two months after 9/11 they were proposing new \"anti-terrorism\" laws to \"protect the public\". How on earth anyone in New Zealand is in any more danger now than they were on September 10th 2001 would defeat anyone with a modicum of intelligence. Enough to move your eyelids would be sufficient to see what a nonsense that is. But common sense is not the motivation here. The aim and the game is for the Illuminati to activate its operatives and unthinking stooges to use the excuse of the World Trade Center disaster to further imprison the human cattle. Gary Hart of the Council on Foreign Relations talked of \"a continuing trade off between security and liberty and freedom going forward into the 21st century\". 58 US Attorney General John Ashcroft set about his task with undisguised relish, and the dismantling of freedoms and the increase in government surveillance has been introduced with what the American Civil Liberties Union calls \"dizzying speed\". 59 Ashcroft and the Bush administration rushed through the \"USA Patriot Act\" in response to the 9/11 attacks and I have no doubt it was already drafted well before those planes took off from Boston airport. In fact James X. Dempsey and David Cole reveal in their book, Terrorism and the Constitution: Sacrificing Civil Liberties in the Name of National Security, 60 that the most extreme elements of the \"anti-terrorism\" laws introduced after Oklahoma and September 11th were developed \"long before the bombings that triggered their final enactment.\" Dempsey is a former assistant counsel to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, and Cole is a professor of law at Georgetown University and an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights. They document how it was the Reagan-Bush and Bush-Quayle administrations that first proposed some of the \"most troubling provisions\" that were to become law after Oklahoma and September 11th, but Congress had rejected them as unconstitutional. These included giving power to the Secretary of State to designate groups as terrorist organisations without judicial or congressional review. But then came the Oklahoma bombing and attitudes began to change as people like Senator Orrin Hatch from Mormon Utah aggressively supported the introduction of the Bush proposals. Hatch is the man who dismissed any suggestion that the authorities were responsible for Waco; who took money from Rumsfeld's Searle pharmaceuticals to support aspartame; who made stirring speeches in support of the BCCI; who called those who questioned the \"anti- terrorism\" laws after 9/11 as nothing more than \"Senate egos\"; who told the media i mmediately after the September 11th attacks that Osama bin Laden was the likely suspect. Nice man. \"Senator Hatch wanted to make it more difficult for federal courts to order retrials of prisoners where state courts had violated the US Constitution\", according to Dempsey and Cole. In the wake of Oklahoma the dismantling of basic freedoms first proposed by Father George Bush became law and even more so after September 11th. A coincidence? Not a chance."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 193 As I mentioned earlier, whenever the Illuminati use words the real meaning is the very opposite of how they are presented. For example, the control of the world economy by a few global corporations owned by the same people is called \"free trade\" and a dictatorship is called a democracy or a \"democratic front\". In this case, removing the very freedoms on which the United States claims to have been founded is called an act of patriotism or a \"USA Patriot Act\", a term that derives from the very deliberate naming of the legislation as \"Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act\". The government demonises \"patriots\" and \"patriotism\" when the American Patriot movement challenges the tyranny of government and the global conspiracy, but \"patriotism\" is promoted when it means doing whatever the government tells you. This is an old, old, trick. Theodore Roosevelt defined patriotism in far more sensible and mature terms. He said: \"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiently or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.\" As Samuel Johnson said: \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\" The Patriot Act, and other legislation and presidential decrees, have basically given those that control the American government the legal right to do whatever they like. Many of these new \"laws\" have been implemented through a scam introduced by the Boy George administration called the \"emergency rule-making authority\", which exempts the Attorney General from respecting the normal notice and comment period for such changes. Crucially for Americans, the definition of a terrorist in the Patriot Act is designed to apply to them also. The act defines terrorism as activities that \"involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; or appear to be intended 'to intimidate or coerce a civilian population' and \"to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion\". That could be defined as almost anything, including legitimate peaceful protest. President Bush issued a \"Military Order\" on November 13th 2001 that makes legal the potentially indefinite detention of any \"non-citizen\" accused of terrorism, and permits the \"trial\" of such defendants by a secret military commission with no provision for j udicial review.\" The person can therefore be chosen by the President to go before a secret tribunal, which can \"try\", convict and sentence him, including imposing the death sentence, without making any of its evidence or the defence case available to the public. Indeed the public would not have to be told the tribunal had even happened. Christopher Pyle, Professor of Politics and Constitutional Law at Mount Holyoke College, says that military tribunals do not need to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or even \"a preponderance of evidence"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"194 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. pointing to guilt\". He adds: \"The court just needs to convince the majority of the military officers present - all of whom see themselves as being 'at war' with this prisoner ... that he has been involved in a terrorist act.\" 62 This Presidential Order was issued without a formal Congressional declaration of war and without Congressional authorisation to use military tribunals. Professor Pyle said he has no idea how Bush even had the power to make such laws. \"Where does the President get the right to do this?\" he says. \"He claims the right to do this as President, as commander in chief, pursuant to the resolution passed in Congress after the September 11th attacks and pursuant to several statutes in US code. But there's nothing in either the Congressional resolution or federal law that allows the President to override the legislative process.\"\" This fascist order from Bush for secret military \"trials\" applies to any individual the President claims to have \"reason to believe\" is: (a) a member of al-Qaeda; (b) in any way involved in \"acts of international terrorism\" (a term that is not defined by the order); or (c) has \"knowingly harbored\" either of the above. Administration officials have announced that they intend to use President Bush's \"Military Order\" in any case in which they decide that an open public hearing would not be consistent with the needs of security. Bush spokesmen say the order applies only to those accused of war crimes, but the jurisdiction of the order does not include any such restriction.\"' The order therefore gives a liar, crook and promoter of capital punishment like George W. Bush, and his successors, the right to ignore the United States criminal justice system whenever it suits him or the agenda he serves. Watch for these laws being extended to include US citizens when an excuse for that can be manufactured. Yet the vast majority of Americans stand by and watch this happen, even cheer in support while believing they live in the \"freest country in the world\". You have almost got to laugh. Almost. The following are some of the other powers included in the \"Patriot Act\" and related new laws that were introduced only because of the September 11th attacks. Much of the information is supplied by the American Civil Liberties Union.\" The Patriot Act allows federal agents to search a person's home secretly; monitor anyone's Internet browsing whenever they choose; expand wiretaps without any need for permission from a judge (not that this would be hard to get, to say the least); seize voicemail messages; and give secret grand jury testimony to the FBI and intelligence agencies. Law enforcement officers now have the legal right to share intercepts of telephone conversations and Internet communications with the CIA, National Security Agency, Department of Defense and other federal agencies with no court order required and there are, in effect, no restrictions on the subsequent use of recorded conversations. The Act does not prohibit the CIA and other agencies from sharing with foreign governments the surveillance information gleaned from a criminal investigation, even if this could put at risk a person's family living abroad. This information can include medical records, mental health records, financial records, video rental records, fingerprints, DNA samples from a person's hair, employment records, \"employment-based\" drug-testing records and i mmigration records maintained by non-profit agencies. Before this, FBI agents had"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster  Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 195 to seek such permission from a judge or through a grand jury subpoena issued in connection with a criminal investigation. These safeguards are no longer necessary. They can do what they want. Section 215 of the Patriot Act grants FBI agents authority to obtain an order from a \"FISA\" court or any federal magistrate requiring any person or business to produce any books, records, documents or items. FISA is the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that was \"updated\" across the millennium to allow wiretaps of American residents who would otherwise be beyond the FBI's authority. Under the Patriot Act a judge has no discretion with these FBI requests. He or she must issue the order after receiving an FBI application that claims to be involved in a foreign intelligence investigation. It doesn't have to be true; they just have to say it. This means that the FBI can secretly conduct a physical search or wiretap to obtain \"evidence of a crime\" without proving the probable cause of a crime. All they need to do is claim \"intelligence authority\", even when the person whose home they wish to break into, or whose telephone they want to tap, is an American. Given the FBI's horrific and well-documented history of investigating people merely because of their race or political views, it is easy to see how these powers will be used. The New York Times also reported that Attorney General Ashcroft was considering a plan to relax restrictions on the FBI by giving them greater freedom to spy on religious and political organizations . 66 All these new laws make the FBI and the CIA, in effect, the same organisation - exactly what the Illuminati want in their agenda of centralisation and globalisation. The Patriot Act means that the CIA can now easily spy on American citizens, a role it has been forbidden to take, at least in law, since the Church Committee exposed appalling abuses of its surveillance of American citizens in the 1970s. But now the Patriot Act allows disclosure to the CIA of \"foreign intelligence information\" obtained in connection with a domestic criminal investigation, without defining \"foreign intelligence information\". This, says the American Civil Liberties Union, represents \"extraordinary extensions of the previous powers of the foreign intelligence agencies, including the CIA, to obtain information about Americans\". 67 All this will happen without a court order. Ashcroft's Department of \"Justice\" can now monitor conversations between \"suspects\" and their lawyers (when they can get one). All \"Justice\" Department officials require is \"reasonable suspicion\" (and they decide what that means) to believe that a prisoner \"may\" use communications with attorneys or their agents \"to further or facilitate acts of terrorism\". The regulation requires that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons \"shall ... provide appropriate procedures for the monitoring or review of communications between that inmate and attorneys or attorneys' agents who are traditionally covered by the attorney-client privilege. This includes pre-trial detainees who have not been convicted of any crime and are therefore presumed innocent, and material witnesses and individuals who are being held on suspected immigration violations and are not accused of any crime. Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions now monitor daily financial transactions even more closely than before and are required to share this information"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. with federal agencies, including intelligence agencies like the CIA. These provisions go far beyond searching for terrorist funds or money laundering (like the Bush- connected BCCI) and involve snooping on perfectly innocent financial transactions by American citizens. Once again the \"fight against terrorism\" is being used to massively increase surveillance of the very population these new laws are supposed to be \"protecting\" from terrorism. Section 358 allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to gain easy and secret access to credit reports. These agencies would not have to ask a judge for permission and the person involved would never know what had happened. It is another \"do what you like\" invasion of privacy, with the agencies having no requirement to justify their actions with evidence of a crime, suspicious activity, or even relevance to an investigation. When it comes to the government being open to the same scrutiny, however, that's another story. Ashcroft has sought to undermine the American Freedom of Information Act with a change of policy that encourages federal agencies to resist Freedom of Information Act requests whenever they have legal grounds to do so. He has told them to withhold information whenever they could argue a \"sound legal basis\" for doing so. On one hand, they are introducing laws to gather more information about people while, on the other, seeking to prevent them knowing, under Freedom of Information, what is on government files. \"Homeland security\" (homeland control) The Patriot Act was claimed to be the result of two weeks of \"closed-door negotiations\" between Congress and the Bush administration. Bullshit. Congressman Ron Paul said they were not even allowed to read the Patriot Bill before they were asked to vote on it, and the \"sunset clauses\" that people were led to believe limited the period the laws are in force turn out not to apply to the most i mportant areas that remove basic freedoms. The legislation, as always in these cases, was already drafted and waiting before those planes struck the World Trade Center. Coordinating this invasion of privacy and the vast expansion of surveillance under the guise of fighting terrorism is the Office of Homeland Security, more accurately known in my house as the Office of Homeland Control. It is amazing how often that, by swapping the word \"security\" for \"control\", you get the truth about an organisation or situation. In fact you can do this with all the Illuminati statements. Reverse them and you see what they really mean. The Office of Homeland Security - a classic Big Brother title - was created by Bush immediately \"after\" September 11th and is headed by the President's pal Tom Ridge, the former Governor of Pennsylvania. After he was elected Governor in 1993 he introduced new anti-crime laws, some of which were ruled unconstitutional.\" Ridge campaigned for all juveniles to be tried as adults and for them to serve adult sentences in adult prisons. He reversed a three-to-one ratio of granting parole to a three-to-one ratio against.' Under Ridge's leadership, the state police were ordered to raid the headquarters of people preparing to protest at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Some 500 people were arrested before they could protest and most were never convicted of any offence. Ridge and Bush both"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 197 have the same approach to \"law enforcement\". Ridge presided over the first state execution in Pennsylvania since 1960 and then embarked on a policy of signing a stream of execution warrants, just as Bush did as Governor of Texas. It was Ridge who pressed for the legislation that introduced the \"three-strikes law\" and a faster death penalty process. The three-strikes law was a stunning piece of insane stupidity that mandated life prison sentences for anyone convicted of three felonies. This treats a murder as a \"strike\" in the same way as filling out a false driver's licence application. I can see why Bush chose Ridge to head \"Homeland Security\". Ridge's role is to create an ever more centralised pyramid of government agencies that will allow even fewer people to dictate the policy and actions of what are supposed to be \"independent\" organisations like the FBI and CIA. As Bush said when he announced the appointment of Ridge: \"Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level.\" 70 In short, centralise and solidify the pyramid to ensure ever more control over ever more people by ever fewer. Dick Cheney appointed Admiral Steve Abbot as Ridge's number two. Abbot was Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the US European Command during the conflict in Kosovo and was Deputy Director of Operations for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Colin Powell) at the end of the Father George Bush administration. In May 2001, four months before September 11th, Dick Cheney launched a review to \"strengthen preparedness against an act of domestic terrorism, particularly one using a weapon of mass destruction\".\" Admiral Abbot was appointed to lead this Cheney group as Executive Director of the Vice President's National Preparedness Review. Abbot is a Rhodes Scholar. These are carefully chosen overseas students, like Bill Clinton, who are sent to England to study at Oxford University. These elite scholarships are named after Cecil Rhodes, one of the most infamous Illuminati operatives of the last 200 years (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). The Office of Homeland Security is dominated and controlled by the military through the Pentagon and it is the Illuminati goal to have domestic \"law enforcement\" conducted by the military, just as any fascist or communist state would do. Airport security is already controlled by the military because of 9 / 11 and that is designed to get the people used to having soldiers around calling the shots in public places. The military running the airports is just the start. As Timothy Edgar, a Legislative Counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, says: \"The military's mission is not to respect constitutional liberties. Its mission is to use overwhelming force to defeat and kill the enemy.\" 72 But then that's the idea. To the Illuminati and their henchmen like Bush, Cheney, et al., the people are the enemy. Herr Bush announced in April 2002 another strand in America's centralised fascist state. It is Northern Command, or NORTHCOM. This is headed by a four-star general and will \"coordinate\" with the Office of Homeland \"Defense\". The first head of NORTHCOM was widely predicted in the media to be"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Ralph Eberhart, the head of NORAD and Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain, whose inaction on September 11th was a disgrace. NORTHCOM will coordinate \"homeland defence\" for North America and Mexico and this is the first time that Mexico comes under a Pentagon command as the global state continues to unfold. General Richard Myers, the head of the joint Chiefs of Staff, said NORTHCOM would \"streamline the Pentagon's various agencies and commands now assigned to support homeland defense roles, putting them under one commander.\" 73 Take away the Orwellian language and you are left with: \"It will further centralise the military control of the United States.\" Most sinister of all is the \"Citizen Corps initiative\", the Bush (Illuminati) plan to recruit a million workers as informants who will report any suspected \"terrorist activity\" among their colleagues, friends, and clients. These informants will be drawn from \"truckers, letter carriers, train conductors, ship captains, utility employees and others\". The American Civil Liberties Union said the Orwellian \"Terrorist Information and Prevention System\" (TIPS) threatened to turn local cable or gas or electrical technicians into government-sanctioned peeping toms. What was that I was saying about the masses policing each other? Now it's official. This is the whole thrust of the Illuminati agenda - to get the people to keep the people in line and act as a global intelligence gathering network in which no one will know who is a \"friend\" and who is a government spy. Like I say, they want a global version of Nazi Germany. Read George Orwell's book, 1984, if you want to now what they have planned. Federal evil malevolent agency (FEMA) One of the key organisations in the Illuminati armoury for their domestic dictatorship and homeland control in the United States is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. It is supposed to be there to respond to disasters and emergencies, but in truth that is only a tiny part of its operation, the part that is officially funded through government agencies. The real role of FEMA is the one financed covertly by the profits from the multi-billion-dollar Illuminati-intelligence agency drug racket. Former Green Beret William Tyree launched a lawsuit against the CIA and Father George Bush in September 1998 claiming that they had allowed the drug profits to fund FEMA's covert activities without the knowledge of Congress.' FEMA was created through a presidential Executive Order, an undemocratic, dictatorial outrage, in which the President introduces laws without debate in Congress. An Executive Order issued by the President only has to appear in a legal newspaper called the Federal Register to become law, and great swathes of the Illuminati's fascist-state-in-waiting has been put together in this way. Among the founders of FEMA was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the man behind the Trilateral Commission at the behest of David Rockefeller. Brzezinski predicted years ago in his book Between Two Ages, 5 that a tiny elite would use its political and financial power and surveillance technology to control the population and dominate the masses. He could say that with confidence because he knew what was planned. Another famous name involved with FEMA was Oliver North, the drug-running"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 199 gofer from Iran-Contra. Ben Bradlee jr writes in Guts and Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North 76 that the Iran-Contra \"star\" helped FEMA to stage a national emergency rehearsal in April 1984 known as Rex-84 Bravo. This was a practice exercise in readiness for martial law and a FEMA takeover in the event of a \"national emergency\". The Miami Herald reported in 1987 that North was involved with FEMA in exercises involving the rounding-up of refugees and \"troublemakers\". Former Green Beret Colonel Albert Carone, who was murdered in 1990, said in a sworn statement for the William Tyree lawsuit that he worked with North in CIA-Mafia drug operations and he also confirmed North's use of drug profits to create and fund FEMA. He said that FEMA violated the United States Constitution and \"established a succession to the Office of the President in the event of an emergency that circumvented the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives\".\" Colonel Carone added: \"Colonel Ollie North worked on developing a plan known as FEMA, which would in an ill-defined national emergency, allow the US Military to take control of the United States to ensure National Security.\" According to Carone's statement, the term \"FEMA\" originally meant \"Federal Emergency Military Action\", but was renamed \"Management Agency\" because the public would more easily accept it. Carone said that a National Security Council directive issued in 1981 states: \"Normally a state of martial law will be proclaimed by the President. However in the absence of such action by the President, a senior military commander may impose martial law in an area of his command where there had been a complete breakdown in the exercise of government functions by local authorities.\" That directive, which allows a military takeover inside the borders of the United States, was signed by ... Frank Carlucci, now chairman of the Carlyle Group. FEMA and associated agencies have been given sweeping powers by presidential executive orders to take control of all areas of life during a \"national emergency\" - whenever the Illuminati front men in government decide to invoke them. In such circumstances FEMA can force the population to live and work wherever they are told. People can be moved from their homes and have their property seized, including farms and businesses. Their children can be taken away from them and FEMA has the power to take over all communications, food and energy sources, health care, finance, education, welfare and transportation, including your personal vehicles. The Postmaster General can order that all men, women and children are registered.\" It is also FEMA that controls the network of concentration camps, or \"detention centers\", in the United States that are in place and waiting for the dissidents and \"troublemakers\" when the Illuminati fascist takeover is complete. Yes, concentration camps in America, of which more later. Foreigners today, Americans tomorrow By observing the treatment of foreign nationals since September 11th we can see the future for Americans in their own land and for the rest of the world also. The authorities have been detaining people across America without charge or trial on no grounds whatsoever except for the colour of their skin and country of origin.

It's just a choice right now between fear and love. cases have come to light, but most have not. Anser Mehmood, a Pakistani truck driver in New Jersey, was allowed no contact with his family for three months after he was arrested without charge in early October 2001. His wife and four children were forced to sell virtually every possession because they no longer had any income and were heading back to Karachi simply to survive while their husband and father awaits his fate. Mohammed Rafiq Butt, another man detailed, died of heart failure at the Hudson County Jail in Kearny, New Jersey, on October 23rd. 79 The Washington Post reported how two Pakistani immigrants were held for 49 days before being charged with overstaying their visas and an Israeli was held for 66 days before being charged with entering the country illegally.\" A Saudi national Dr Al Bader Al-Hazmi, a radiologist at the Texas Health Science Center, was held without access to either his lawyer or his family for seven days. After nearly two weeks in detention, Dr Al-Hazmi was released with no charges against him. The Wall Street journal featured the case of Tarek Mohamed Fayad, an Egyptian national and a dentist in California. He was detained by the FBI on September 13th and transferred to the Brooklyn Detention Center in New York City. The Journal said it was a month before his lawyer was able to locate and talk to him.' Some seven months after 9/11 Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that a Jordanian student had been \"unlawfully detained\" by Ashcroft's Injustice Department because, like so many, he had been jailed purely to ensure that he gives evidence to a grand jury. The judge said that \"... since 1789, no Congress had granted the government the authority to i mprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grand j ury conducting a criminal investigation\".\" Ashcroft, of course, said he would appeal. Not to me he doesn't. We don't know how many innocent people have been detained in America without trial or charge since 9/11 because Ashcroft's operation has refused to say how many have been jailed without charge or trial, and on what basis. The public have no idea who they are, where they are or in what conditions they are being kept. A look at the disgraceful, inhuman, treatment of the uncharged, untried, inmates at the US military base at \"Camp X-Ray\" at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, however, will probably give you a fair idea of the indignity to which they are subjected. As Groucho Marx said: \"Military justice is to justice what military music is to music.\" This is America, the \"Land of the Free\"? What an illusion. All this when members of the bin Laden family were allowed to leave Boston Airport for Saudi Arabia just days after 9/11 with no problem at all because of their friends in high places like President Bush. Britain's fascist state rolls on In Britain, the Blair government and his \"socialist\" Home Secretary David Blunkett have also been sweeping away still more freedoms and civil liberties. Blunkett, the one-time \"left-wing radical\" on Sheffield council, is now just another cap-touching establishment puppet. How the mighty fall. Following the Illuminati script after 9/11, the Blair government now allows foreign-born \"terrorist suspects\" to be detained without trial, a move described by the civil rights group Liberty as \"a fundamental violation of the rule of law \" . \" Internment without trial breaches the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 201 European Convention on Human Rights and this can only be overridden if a state of emergency is declared. So what did Blair and Blunkett do? They declared a state of emergency, thus bypassing Article 5 of the Convention. The UK has jailed \"terrorist suspects\" on no evidence whatsoever. Lotfi Raissi, a 27-year-old Algerian pilot, was arrested days after September 11th and accused by the FBI - yes, them again - of training pilots involved in the attacks. He was jailed by the British authorities in a high-security prison for five months while extradition proceedings took place to hand him over to the American government. But on February 12th 2002, a judge released him because the FBI had produced nothing to back up its ludicrous claims. The FBI said he was an Islamic fundamentalist when he is married to a white Roman Catholic! His wife and brother lost their jobs because of this criminal injustice and his brother Mohammed said: \"They've destroyed his life, his future and his dream.\"\" But rather than accept they were wrong, apologise and pay him compensation, the American government announced that they would still continue to pursue his extradition on two counts of falsifying an application for a United States pilot's licence. One of these involves failing to declare an old tennis injury! My God, these are the people \"investigating\" 9 / 11 and telling us what happened. Fortunately a judge later dismissed the US claims, and Raissi and his family were left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Tony Blair has long targeted civil liberties. He has sought to reduce the number of trials for UK citizens that are heard by a jury, and laws were passed long before 9/11 to erode rights to data privacy and other freedoms. Blair is an Illuminati gofer. They put him in power and they have kept him there, so obviously you would expect him to slavishly pursue their agenda, as he has on every front. New \"anti- terrorist\" laws mean that telecommunications companies are instructed, under the guise of \"national security\", to keep data on phone calls, faxes and e-mails. Britain already has more surveillance cameras per head of population than anywhere else in the world and I saw one school featured in a BBC children's television documentary that had installed nearly 40 cameras and the children couldn't move without being followed on a TV screen. All this is ensuring that children grow up surrounded by surveillance and accept the Big Brother society as part of everyday life. New laws have increased the rights of government agencies to spy on the population's financial transactions and freeze \"suspected\" terrorist funds. Who decides who is \"suspected\"? They do of course. Freedom, RIP Nine months after September 11th it emerged that the Blair government was planning devastating advances in the Big Brother fascist state through something called the Regulation of Investigatory Powers, or R.I.P, Act. The Guardian newspaper revealed that ministers proposed to dramatically expand the number of people and organisations who could demand to be given personal data on the population. The police, intelligence services, Customs & Excise and the Inland Revenue already had these powers, but the Blair government planned to increase the list to include seven government departments, every local council in the country, any fire authority, the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"202 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. National Health Service in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and 11 other public bodies. These organisations would be able to demand, without a court order, that phone companies, Internet service providers and postal operators give them details of a person's phone calls, the source and destination of e-mails, the identity of websites they have visited and the location of their mobile phones, which would reveal the location of the user to within a few hundred yards.\" The government said these expanded powers were needed to \"fight terrorism\". Clearly this is an outrageous lie. John Wadham, director of the human rights organisation, Liberty, said: \"This list demonstrates an issue that many people may not have realised: it is not just the police who will be looking at our communications records, it is practically every public servant who will be able to play this game.\" 86 Ian Brown, director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, said he was appalled at \"this huge increase in the scope of government snooping\" and how these powers were being handed to \"a practically endless queue of bureaucrats in Whitehall and town halls\".\" Simon Davies, director of Privacy International, said: \"The Home Office has absolutely breached its commitment that this law would not become a general surveillance power for the government. The exhaustive list of organisations who will be able to access data without a court order proves that this amounts to a systematic attack on the right to privacy.\" 88 The laws have fundamental implications for journalists and Internet users and servers. Steve Rawlinson, Chief Technical Officer of Claranet, said it dealt with a lot of requests from the police for private information, but many of these were a \"fishing expedition\" and they told the police they were not satisfied there were sufficient grounds. The new laws meant they would have no choice but to hand over private data. Journalists complained that they would no longer be able to keep their sources private, but most of them should have thought of that when they were ridiculing those who were telling them this was coming. Maybe they will now wake up to the fact that the fascist conspiracy they have been ridiculing and claiming does not exist is targeting them and their children as much as anyone else. Home Secretary David Blunkett had the nerve to propose these new laws after pledging in the wake of September 11th that he would not give anyone the power to routinely monitor phone calls or e-mails between individuals. In the summer of 2002 Blunkett also announced laws that force airlines to provide the government with details of every passenger they check-in on an international flight, including the name, address and passport number. The airlines said this would create chaos and massively increase the queues for check-in. But why should Blunkett and company care? While the people are queuing, they'll be in the VIP lounge. \"Airy fairy\" freedoms The response of the Ashcrofts and Blunketts to legitimate concerns about the loss of basic freedoms has been depressingly predictable. It's an old, old, technique: don't address the concerns in an adult way as part of your duty as a public servant - seek"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 203 to discredit those who question and challenge your role as a public dictator. Blunkett called the concerns of civil rights campaigners \"airy fairy\" and, employing the usual technique of painting a polarised picture of black vs white, he said in a television interview on London Weekend Television: \"We could live in a world which is airy fairy, libertarian, where everybody does precisely what they like and we believe the best of everybody and then they destroy us.\" \" 9 That, of course, is not what freedom campaigners are suggesting, and Blunkett knows it. But he says that simply to discredit those who challenge his decisions and to present a false picture of the situation to the public. The UK Foreign Secretary Jack \"straw man\" Straw, a man I would not trust to run a market stall, said that \"naive\" campaigners against stronger Internet surveillance laws have hurt the anti-terrorism campaign. If you don't support what we demand and accept without question the erosion of your own freedoms, you are helping terrorists. Straw also sought to justify the dismantling of freedom when he told the media: \"The most fundamental civil liberty is the right to life and preserving that and sustaining that must come before others.\"\" This is the same Straw who was a vehement supporter of the bombing of Afghanistan that killed thousands more civilians than the attacks in America. Brain- cell activity never was an essential criteria for being a politician, in fact it can be a serious handicap to career advancement. Then there was one Kevin Hughes, a member of Blair's Labour Party, who said during the steam-rollered parliamentary \"debate\" on the anti-terrorism laws that opponents of the plan were from the ... \"yoghurt-eating, muesli-eating, Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing fraternity\".\" What a prat. In the US, of course, Attorney General Ashcroft takes the same line. When challenged on his attacks on basic freedoms, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee: \"To those who pit Americans against immigrants, citizens against non-citizens, to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve ... They give ammunition to America's enemies and pause to America's friends. They encourage people of good will to remain silent in the face of evil.\" 92 More black is white, more smoke and mirrors. Orrin Hatch, the aspartame supporter and senator for the Illuminati Mormon stronghold of Utah, told his colleagues on the committee that criticism of White House plans was nothing more than \"Senate egos\". He said: \"I would implore my colleagues, let's keep our focus where it matters: on protecting our citizens.\" 93 Yeah, yeah, OK, Orrin, you've done your job and I'm sure they will be very pleased with you. Senator Russell Feingold was the lone vote in the Senate against this silent invasion by federal and state dictatorship. He provided confirmation that at least some common sense and principle still survives - just, only just - in Washington. He said: \"If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search your home at any time for any reason, if we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"204 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. on phone conversations, intercept your e-mail communications, hold people in jail i ndefinitely on suspicion that they were up to no good, then the government would no doubt discover and arrest more terrorists. But that would probably not be a country in which we would want to live. That would not be a country in which we could, in good conscience, ask our young people to die for. In short, that country wouldn't be America.\" 94 Such voices of sanity are so few. In the US Congress, the British Parliament, and their like across the world, fundamental attacks on freedom went through with hardly a murmur of serious challenge from politicians or public - all thanks to 9/11. Coincidence? Bush hides daddy's secrets ... and his own But get this: while the Bush government was issuing an explosion of new laws and directives to gather ever more information about the population and impose ever greater surveillance, he took time out on November 1st 2001 to issue an Executive Order that gives Bush and former presidents (like his father) the right to veto requests to open any presidential records. Even if a former president wants his records to be released, the Executive Order permits President Bush or any sitting president to assert executive privilege to stop this, and Boy George and former presidents are now given an indefinite amount of time to ponder any requests. This is a blatant move to hide the grotesque secrets of his father, other presidents and himself, particularly, in his case, in relation to 9/11. How coincidental, too, that this was invoked just as records of the Reagan-Bush administration were due for release under the Presidential Records Act, a post-Watergate law intended to ensure the release of administration records 12 years after a president leaves office. 95 So who benefits? What happened on September 11th was the most glaring and obvious example I have seen of the technique I have dubbed problem-reaction-solution. 9 / 11 had every element in enormous abundance. First you covertly create the problem and i mmediately name the person or people \"responsible\" to divert attention from any open-minded speculation or questioning about who was really behind it. Second, you report the problem through the media in the form that you wish the public to believe. Third, you offer the solution to your problem amid the manipulated public clamour for you to \"do something\". The atrocities in America, and their aftermath, have provided an excuse for an open-ended problem-reaction-solution in the form of the \"war on terrorism\". How can you tell when you have won a war on terrorism? You can't. They have launched a war without end in which they can attack any country or target they can demonise as either \"terrorists\" or \"supporters of terrorists\". That was the idea. As British Prime Minister Tony Blair said i mmediately after September 11th: \"This is a moment to seize. The kaleidoscope has been shaken, the pieces are in flux, soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us reorder this world around us.\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Problem-Reaction-Solution \t 205 And on September 12th, at a televised event organised by the Rockefeller- Illuminati Council on Foreign Relations, the former presidential candidate Gary Hart said: \"There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out ... a phrase his father used ... and that is a New World Order.\" That phrase was delivered in a speech by Father George in relation to the Gulf \"War\" on September 11th 1990 - 11 years to the day before 9/11. As I said in the opening chapter, the antidote to P-R-S is the question: \"Who benefits?\" This always reveals the force behind the \"problem\". Who benefits from 9 / 11? One group and one group alone - anyone who wants a massive increase in surveillance and control of the people, individually and collectively; the further centralisation of global power; a systematic destruction of basic freedoms and civil liberties; an excuse to invade, devastate and take over any country they choose to target; and a fantastic increase in public spending on the military for operations at home and aboard. Whoever was behind 9 / 11 has achieved all of these aims and so much more. Who wants such a society? The Illuminati and their agents in government, as I have been exposing for more than a decade. They want centralisation of power in all areas of our lives until the world government, central bank, currency, army, police force, intelligence agency, and micro-chipped population are in place. They want an excuse to send their armies into any country whose regime is not playing ball, or whose land and resources they desire to control. One event has given them all of these things since September 11th 2001. Are we really to believe that those two facts are not connected, that all this is all mere \"coincidence\"? Are we really? I was interviewed on a Los Angeles radio station in the days after 9/11 by a couple of hosts who were not the sharpest pins in the box to say the least. I said that the attacks had been organised within their own borders by Illuminati groups that control the federal government and the military, and that they would soon see new laws introduced by that same federal government that would remove fundamental freedoms from American society. The idea that agencies of the United States government could have been involved in the attacks against American people was more than their neuron pathways could process and the hosts decided that I must either be \"mad\" or \"on something\". So I made them an offer to come back on the show a month later and I said that if massive erosions of freedom had not occurred in America by then I would hold my hand up and say I was wrong. They said OK, it was a deal; they would call me in a month. The erosions of freedom duly took place. They never called."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.
