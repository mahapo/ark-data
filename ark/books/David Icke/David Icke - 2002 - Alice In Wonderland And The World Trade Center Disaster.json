In truth,these exist only as illusions and delusions in the manufactured movie we aretold is “life”. They are figments of our perception, that’s all.Through these years there has rarely been a day in which I have not worked insome way to uncover or communicate the astonishing story of how a network ofinterbreeding bloodlines going back to the ancient world has expanded itscontrol over the human population until, today, a full-blown global dictatorshipis within its sight and within its grasp. To understand the true background tothe horrors of September 11th 2001, you have to research and understand so manysubjects, many of them considered bizarre or crazy to our conditioned reality.Once the pieces are understood then the puzzle has to be put together to allowthe extraordinary picture of human existence to be revealed. So when people askme why this information has never been made public before there are three mainanswers: (a) many researchers have uncovered aspects of it, even large swathesof it, but communicating what they know through the mainstream media has beenimpossible; (b) the compartmentalised secrecy behind which the truth is hiddenhas been extremely effective; and (c) because of the staggering amount ofresearch over so many years that is necessary to understand the pieces evenbefore the puzzle itself can be addressed.Without this background knowledge the manipulators can hoodwink the globalpopulation by explaining away grotesque atrocities like September 11th with aridiculous cover story that protects the real perpetrators and justifies theresponses, like the “war” with Afghanistan, that further their goal of globaldictatorship. In my last three books on these subjects, And The Truth Shall SetYou Free, The Biggest Secret, and Children Of The Matrix, I have presented atotal of 1,500 pages detailing the story of human control and how the sameinterbreeding bloodlines that produced the kings and queens of the ancient worldnow produce the presidents, prime ministers, banking and business leaders, mediaowners and military chiefs of the 21st century. For those who really want toknow the nature of the human condition and the mental, emotional and,increasingly, physical prison in which we find ourselves, they can read thosebooks or go to the thousands of web pages of information at www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com]. Clearly, I can’t detail it all again in this bookbecause its focus is the staggering events of September 11th 2001 and theiraftermath, but the information is already in print for anyone who wants moresupporting evidence. Here, for those new to these subjects, I will set out abrief summary of the essential background necessary to understand what reallyhappened on 9/11. Readers of my other books will already be well versed in thisinformation.Bloodlines and the “divine” right to ruleThe families that covertly control the system that controls the people arespawned from ancient bloodlines that have a different DNA to the rest of thepopulation. It has been described to me by insiders as a DNA “corruption”. Thedifferences in the DNA are tiny, but highly significant. In fact, in DNA termsthere is not that much difference between humans and mice, but look at thefantastic difference in how they manifest and what they can do. When you lookback through history you find the theme of the “divine right” of kings andqueens. What is that? It is the right to rule … because of your bloodline, yourDNA. I will go into the origins of these ruling families and what is reallymeant by “divine” at the end of the book. It is so challenging and mind-blowingto most people it is best left until much more has been said. Suffice to saythat these bloodlines are not “human” in the sense that we perceive the term“human”. This rule-by-bloodline still openly exists today, of course, with QueenElizabeth II, an obvious example. She only lives in Buckingham Palace and enjoysall the power and privilege of a head of state because of her DNA. If she had adifferent DNA she might be cleaning the throne rather than sitting on it. Thesame applies to the rest of her family, which is strictly structured accordingto its DNA relationship to the reigning “monarch”. As the ancient recordsconfirm, it was the “royal” bloodlines (the “demi-gods”) that were placed inpositions of ruling royal power thousands of years ago. They were the kings andqueens in Egypt, Sumer, the Indus Valley and around the world who claimed thedivine right to rule because of their bloodline. What people don’t realise isthat the political, business, banking and media leaders are also overwhelminglyoperating within a similar DNA hierarchy that decides who does what. This isbecause they are of the same bloodlines as the ancient royal and aristocraticfamilies who ruled thousands of years ago. The same interbreeding “royal andaristocratic” tribe has controlled the world for all this time. Only thepositions from which they operate have changed.Fantastic cataclysms struck the earth around perhaps 11,500 to 12,000 years ago.These destroyed, in stages, vast continents in the Atlantic and Pacific thathave become known as Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria. The universal stories of theGreat Flood are related to this. After these literally world-shattering events,and others that followed, the “divine” bloodline installed itself again invarious locations. This happened most significantly in the Near and Middle East,especially from about 4,000BC with an empire based on Sumer in what is nowcalled Iraq, and it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sumer,according to official history, was the start of human “civilisation” as we knowit, but in fact it was merely the restart after the Atlantis/Mu upheavals(Figure 1). The bloodline was placed in the positions of royal andadministrative power over the people in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, the Indus Valleyand much further afield, including the Americas and China. Over thousands ofyears, these bloodlines expanded out of the Middle and Near East into Europe,and the royal bloodlines of Sumer, Egypt, etc., became the royal andaristocratic families of Britain, Ireland and the countries of mainland Europe,especially France, Germany and what is now called Belgium (Figure 2 overleaf).Wherever they went these royal and aristocratic lines interbred obsessively witheach other through arranged marriages and secret breeding programmes. You cansee the same with the ruling families of today because they are seeking toperpetuate a particular genetic code, the DNA “corruption” that can be quicklydiluted by breeding outside of their bloodline circle.image [../Images/00003.jpg]Figure 1: The highly advanced cultures in the Middle-Near East with Sumer themost powerful and significant. From this region have come many of the bloodlinesthat thousands of years later continue to control the world The bloodline empiresIn ancient times Babylon was one of the headquarters of the secret societynetwork – the “Illuminati” – through which these bloodlines manipulate humanity.Babylon was in the same region as Sumer. This Illuminati bloodline network thenmoved its headquarters to Rome and it was during this time that we had the RomanEmpire and the creation of the Roman Church or institutionalised Christianity.The headquarters eventually moved on again into northern Europe after the fallof the Roman Empire and for a period it was based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.This was when the Dutch began to build their empire through the Dutch East IndiaCompany and they settled South Africa. In 1688, William of Orange, one of thebloodlines, invaded England from The Netherlands and took the throne as WilliamIII in 1689. William ruled jointly with Queen Mary and then by himself after herdeath in 1694. In that year William signed the charter that created the Bank ofEngland and the global banking system began to emerge. Banking and manufactureddebt has always been one of the key vehicles used by the bloodlines to controlhumanity. From this time the bloodlines and their Illuminati secret societynetwork moved their centre of operation to London and what followed, of course,was the “great” and enormous British Empire. This was not, in truth, the Empireof the “British”, but that of the Illuminati bloodlines based in Britain.image [../Images/00004.jpg]Figure 2: From at least 3000BC, peoples of the Sumer Empire, like thePhoenicians and Egyptians, sailed to Britain and took their knowledge andsymbols to those islands. Others began to move across land to settle in what wenow call France, Germany, and the rest of northern Europe. Wherever they went,the Illuminati bloodlines invariably ruled as kings, queens, and nobility The hidden handThis vast expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts ofthe world exported these bloodlines to every continent, including, mostimportantly today, North America. When the European empires began to recede andcollapse, especially in the 20th century, it appeared that these colonycontinents, like the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia, had won their“independence”. Instead, the Illuminati bloodlines were merely exchanging opencontrol for the far more effective covert control – manipulation of events bythe Hidden Hand that the public has no idea even exists. While these empireswere apparently being dismantled, the Illuminati left in their “former”colonies, including the United States, the bloodline and the secret societynetwork through which they manipulate. Ever since that time they have continuedto control events in these “former” colonies as part of a long-planned agenda toimpose centralised control of the planet and its people. This is designed to bestructured as a world government, army, central bank and currency; amicro-chipped population connected to a global computer; and a society based onconstant and total surveillance of every man, woman and child. A ridiculousconspiracy ‘theory’? Well have another look around and you’ll see that this ishappening today, now, and never more blatantly than since September 11th. We areseeing unfold by the day the very Big Brother society described by George Orwell(real name Eric Blair) in his famous book, 1984.1 I believe that Orwell was notwriting from his imagination so much as from insider knowledge of the agenda andthis is the very governmental structure that is now staring us in the face –especially since September 11th. The need for centralisation is obvious. Thegreater the diversity of decision-making the less control you are going to haveover those decisions. Diversity is the controllers’ nightmare and they haveworked constantly to centralise decision-making and increase their power. Thereason that the centralisation in all areas of our lives, political, economic,business, military and media has progressed with a faster and faster pace is asimple equation. The more you centralise power the more power you have tocentralise even quicker.The bloodline presidentsThe bloodlines that seek to control the world and our lives today are the samebloodlines that ruled the ancient societies. They are the presidents of theUnited States, the prime ministers, the leading banking and business families,the media owners and those who control the military. The US presidents are awonderful example of this. There are some 300 million people in the UnitedStates today and many hundreds of millions more have lived in that country sincethe major Freemason George Washington was inaugurated more than 200 years ago.Not only that, the genetic diversity of the American people has been enormousbecause of the many locations from which they have come. So you would expectthat the 43 presidents from Washington to George W. Bush would express some ofthat diversity, surely? After all, one of the mantras supporting the myth ofAmerican “freedom” is that anyone can become President of the United States. Er,sorry. The genetic diversity of the US presidents is incredibly limited andfundamentally connected to European royal and aristocratic bloodlines (see TheBiggest Secret and Children Of The Matrix). Of the 43 presidents, 34 go backgenetically to Charlemagne (742–814), the most famous monarch of what we nowcall France and a major figure in the Illuminati story and the bloodline. He wasleader of the Franks, after whom we get the name France, and Emperor of the HolyRoman Empire. From the Illuminati point of view, he was serious bloodline.In the last weeks of the farcical 2000 US presidential election campaign,Burke’s Peerage, the blue-blood “bible” of royal and aristocratic genealogy,confirmed the theme I am highlighting here. Four years earlier, when BillClinton faced Bob Dole, Burke’s Peerage said that the candidate with the mostroyal genes had won every single presidential election in US history. Clintonand George W. Bush have since continued that sequence. At the very least, thevast majority of US presidents have been of royal and aristocratic blood. In aReuters report of October 17th 2000, Burkes Peerage confirmed that both GeorgeW. Bush and “opponent” Al Gore were of royal descent with Bush the “bluer” ofthe two. Purely by knowing his bloodline and watching the behind-the-scenesdevelopments, I was able to predict three years before the 2000 election thatGeorge W. Bush would be the next President of the United States. Bush is relatedto every European monarch on and off the throne, including the king of Albania,and has “kinship” with every member of Britain’s royal family, the report said.He is a 13th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, who died in 2002 at the age of101, and her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Bush is a 13th cousin, once removed, ofthe heir to the throne Prince Charles, and has a direct descent from Henry IIIand from Henry VIII’s sister, Mary Tudor, who was also the wife of Louis XI ofFrance. Bush is further descended from Charles II of England. HaroldBrooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke’s Peerage, said in the Reutersreport: “It is now clear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush have an unusually large numberof royal and noble descents.” But only unusual if you don’t know the story. Headded: “In point of fact, never in the history of the United States have twopresidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances.” Brooks-Bakersaid there had always been a significant “royal factor” in those who aspire tothe White House with presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklinand Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue-bloodlinks. He said that Al Gore, a cousin of former President Richard Nixon, was adescendant of England’s Edward I and has direct links to the Holy Roman Empirethrough Emperors Louis II, Charles II, and Louis I. This, therefore, makes him adescendant of Charlemagne, the 8th century Emperor. These Charlemagne links makeAl Gore a cousin of George W. Bush.The secret language – symbolismThe bloodlines and their Illuminati network are obsessed with symbolism andtheir symbols and codes going back thousands of years can clearly be foundthroughout American society and the rest of the world. The ancient Illuminatisymbol of the pyramid with the capstone missing or the pyramid and all-seeingeye was placed on the dollar bill (Figure 3) in 1933/34 by President FranklinDelano Roosevelt, one of the most significant front men for the Illuminati inthe United States during the 20th century. The most obvious Illuminati symbol isthe eternal flame or the lighted torch and this represents the “illuminatedones”, the initiates illuminated into knowledge that the rest of the populationis denied. The Illuminati lighted torch is held by the Statue of Liberty. Thiswas given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris who knew what she and thetorch really symbolised. There is a virtual mirror image of the Statue ofLiberty on an island in the River Seine in Paris. The Statue of Liberty is, infact, the symbolic image of Queen Semiramis, the goddess worshipped by theIlluminati bloodlines when they were based in Babylon. If you look at Figures 4and 5 (overleaf) you can see the image of Queen Semiramis on an ancient coin andher representation as the Statue of Liberty. The Babylonian trinity was: Nimrod,who was symbolised as a fish; Tammuz or Ninus, the son who died to savehumanity; and Queen Semiramis, the mother goddess who was symbolised as a dove.The Illuminati use what I call reverse symbolism. They place their symbols allaround us but present them with the reverse of their public meaning. Forexample, the dove symbolises peace to most people, but to the Illuminatibloodlines it represents their goddess, Queen Semiramis. The lighted torch meansfreedom and liberty to the population, but to the Illuminati it is the verysymbol of their agenda and control. The Nazis reversed the ancient symbol of theswastika to symbolise the negative and Satanists have reversed the pentagram topoint downwards for the same reason. Everything is symbolism and ritual to theIlluminati, and always has been. After they killed President Kennedy in Dallasin 1963, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry placed an obelisk in Dealey Plaza witha lighted torch at the top. When they buried Kennedy at Arlington Cemetery inWashington DC they placed a lighted torch, the Illuminati eternal flame, on hisgrave. The spot where people leave their tributes to the murdered Princess Dianain Paris is a massive representation of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty.It is located on top of the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel where the Illuminati arrangedfor her to die in 1997 (see The Biggest Secret).image [../Images/00005.jpg]Figure 3: The ancient Illuminati symbol of the pyramid and all-seeing eye on thedollar bill Queen Semiramis, which translates as “branch bearer”, was symbolised in Babylonas a dove and when the Illuminati bloodlines moved their headquarters to Romethis goddess was worshipped as Venus Columba or Venus the Dove. The French wordfor dove is still colombe. This is why a man who signed his name “Colon” isknown to official history as “Columbus”. He was bearing the branch of the doveinto the Americas in 1492 and was given this symbolic name relating to theIlluminati “Goddess”. So we have the centre of US government located inWashington “DC” – the District of Columbia, or the dove, Semiramis. We haveBritish Columbia in Canada, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS), Columbia University,and Columbia Pictures with the symbol of the woman and the lighted torch. Thesymbols abound in relation to September 11th, also. The twin towers, or twinpillars, are ancient Illuminati symbols that go back at least to Atlantis. Oneof the foundation legends in the Mythology of the Freemasons and the KnightsTemplar secret societies is that of Jachin and Boaz … the “Twin Pillars” ofAtlantis, which are said to have been erected at the entrance to King Solomon’sTemple in Jerusalem. In the Old Testament you will find references to this:> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right> pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and> called the name thereof Boaz. (1 Kings 7:21)> And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the> other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and> the name of that on the left Boaz. (2 Chronicles 3:17) image [../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 4: This is how the Illuminati goddess, Queen Semiramis, the“branch-bearer”, was portrayed by the ancients image [../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 5: Semiramis again, this time under the guise of the Statue of “Liberty” You will find the symbol of the twin pillars in Freemasonic architecture and theoriginal ones are said to have been built, according to Freemasonic legend, byinhabitants of Atlantis called “the children of Lamech”. The United States isthe “New Atlantis” to the Illuminati. There is a legend of the twin pillars, ortwin towers, in which one represented Upper Egypt (the “north tower”) and theother symbolised Lower Egypt (the “south tower”). There is also the mythology ofthe twin pillars of Hercules that he is said to have placed at the entrance tothe Mediterranean. The number 11 itself, of course, consists of twin columns andthe first plane to hit the twin towers on September 11th was Flight 11. Therecurrence of 11 in the events of that day are remarkable – but highlypredictable for those who study Illuminati ritual.2 It was 11 years to the daybefore 9/11 – September 11th 1990 – that Father George Bush made a speech toCongress calling for a “New World Order”. This is the ancient code name for theIlluminati agenda for global control that the terrorist attacks were designed toadvance. The Pentagon was also targetted on September 11th. The symbol of thepentagon is the centre of the pentagram, the most obvious symbol of Satanic andIlluminati ritual and 911 is the phone number that Americans call to reportemergencies. This is not a coincidence, as anyone who has studied theIlluminati’s astonishing obsession with symbolism will know. In the finalchapter I’ll explain where this obsession comes from. The name Capitol Hill isalso Illuminati symbolism and named after Capitoline Hill, a sacred place forthe Illuminati outside Rome during the Roman Empire. (See The Biggest Secret forextensive information about the Illuminati secret language that can be seen allaround us.) The symbolism can also be found in their language and statements. Tocrack their code, you have to reverse what they appear to say. When theyannounce that they believe something, it means they don’t. When they say theywill do something, it means they won’t. When they say they won’t, it means theywill and so on. It is a real life Alice in Wonderland. They operate with thiscoded symbolism in which everything is reversed. Thus killing thousands ofAfghan civilians becomes “fighting for freedom, peace and justice”. Reverse“theirs” to “ours” in this statement by George W. Bush after September 11th, forexample, and he is actually talking about himself and those who control him:> “Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened,> by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice while daring to> claim the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power> of evil, it is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in the> terrorists evil has found a willing servant.” The IlluminatiThe world’s “elite” families, no more than 13 at the peak of the pyramid,manipulate their control of humanity through a network of secret societies. Thisnetwork and the interbreeding bloodlines it serves have become known as theIlluminati, the ‘Illuminated Ones’. The Illuminati is an organisation within allsignificant organisations. It’s like a cancer. All the major secret societiesfeed carefully chosen recruits into the Illuminati and these are the ones youfind in positions of power throughout the world. They infest all colours, races,creeds and countries, and yet, so effective is the compartmentalised secrecythat even the vast majority of people within these secret societies have no ideawhat they are really part of. Most Freemasons never progress higher than thebottom three levels of degree, the so-called Blue Degrees. They have no ideawhat their organisation is being used for. Even most of those who make it to theapparently highest level, like the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite, can knowrelatively little unless they are “chosen”. Only the tiny few, all fromparticular bloodlines and their offshoots, progress through the official peak oftheir ‘individual’ secret society into the Illuminati degrees above that. Theseare the levels into which the secret societies feed the chosen ones, but atleast 95% of their members have no idea that these levels exist, never mind whois in them and what happens there. Among the key secret societies within theIlluminati web are the upper levels of the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Knightsof Malta, Knights of St John of Jerusalem, and the Jesuits, the network thatcontrols the Roman Catholic Church and uses it to serve the Illuminati. TheJesuit hierarchy is extremely powerful within the Illuminati all over the worldand highly significant in the manipulation of global society. Some of the familylines involved are the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, House of Lorraine, Habsburgs,and the Thurn und Taxis dynasty from Bergamo, Italy, which expanded intoBelgium, Bavaria, and wider afield. The Thurn und Taxis bloodline is also highlysignificant to the Illuminati although not mentioned by researchers as often assome of the others.The freemasonsJim Shaw, a former 33rd-degree Freemason, exposes the Craft in his book, TheDeadly Deception3 and confirms what I have just described. He explains howFreemasonry is based on a structure of compartmentalised pyramids (Figure 6).Only a few make it to the top of the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite or the 10degrees of the York Rite and even then they still don’t know the real secrets.Shaw says he was surprised when a fellow 33rd-degree Mason said that “they” hadtold him he was “going higher” and the guy left the temple by a different door.4A bigger pyramid encompasses all the major secret societies and at that pointthey are one secret society. So you have this vast web of secret societies withmillions of members worldwide who think they know what they are involved in,but, in truth, only a few have any idea of what is going on and who, ultimately,is calling the shots. Albert Pike, who died in 1891, was one of the mostpre-eminent figures in world Freemasonry. Among his titles were Sovereign GrandCommander of the Supreme Council of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff ofUniversal Freemasonry. In his book, Morals and Dogma, written for higher-degreeFreemasons, he reveals the way the lower levels are misled:> ‘The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of> the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally> mis-led by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand> them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them …> Their true implication is reserved for Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.’ 5Exactly. Jim Shaw says that there are two kinds of Freemason. One just sitsthrough the meetings and doesn’t make much effort to understand the ritual. Theother does all the work, but only keeps to the ritual, and memorises or readsthe words without understanding what they really mean. That is correct, butthere is a third kind: the very few who know the truth of who really controlsFreemasonry and what the rituals and initiations are really designed to achieve.Shaw also confirms from his own experience how the Freemasons manipulate theirown people into whatever positions they choose. At work, Shaw’s departmentdirector, a fellow Freemason, advised him to apply for a particular job. Shawfelt he was under-qualified for the post and would fail the test paper.6 Onlythrough the urging of his Freemason boss did he apply. When he arrived to takethe test he was amazed to see that there were only two other applicants for ajob he believed would be keenly contested. When he turned over the test paper,he saw that the questions were very easy and he finished them quickly. His tworivals, however, were clearly finding the paper tough and could not complete itin the allotted time. Shaw got the job. Why? Because he was not given the samepaper as the other two.image [../Images/00008.jpg]Figure 6: The Masonic Structure When he walked out of Freemasonry after realising the scam, the oppositehappened. He found his bosses far less supportive, to say the least. This isjust one small example of how the Illuminati and their secret society web ensurethat their guys are in the positions that matter. It is actually astonishing howfew people you need to control in order to dictate your agenda through the wholesystem if they are (a) in the key positions of decision-making and (b) they havethe power to appoint those in the important positions below them. An example:you control the chief of police who decides the policy and he can appoint theheads of the various departments in his force. He introduces Illuminati policyand chooses his major subordinates from secret society initiates. They, in turn,can appoint the people within their departments and can thus choose more secretsociety initiates for the positions below them. So it goes on. Once you havecontrol of the top man in any organisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e.the Illuminati’s, image. Governments are structured in the same way, as are“security” organisations like the FBI, CIA, British Intelligence and those whocontrol the Pentagon. They are compartmentalised pyramids in themselves, butthere is also a pyramid that encompasses all of them and can thereforecoordinate a common plan of action between them, exactly as it did on September11th.image [../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 7: Pyramids of Manipulation Pyramids within pyramidsUnderstanding the pyramid structure is vital to understanding how the few canmanipulate the many on a global scale. The pyramid structure of secret societiesis mirrored in government, banking, business and every other organisation andinstitution. It is like those Russian dolls with one doll inside a bigger oneuntil the biggest doll encompasses them all. The Illuminati replace the ‘dolls’with pyramids (Figure 7). Every organisation today is a pyramid. Only the few atthe top know the real agenda of the organisation and what it is trying toachieve. The further you go down the pyramid the more people are working for theorganisation, but the less they know about its real agenda. They are only awareof the individual job they do every day. They don’t know how their contribution(apparently innocent in isolation) connects with those of other employees inother areas of the company. They are compartmentalised from that knowledge andtold only what they need to know to do their job. The only people who know howit all fits together are the very few sitting at the top – the bloodlinefamilies and their lackeys.The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger andbigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all ofthe banks. It is the same with the transnational corporations, politicalparties, secret societies, media empires and the military. If you go high enoughin this structure all the transnational corporations (like the oil cartel),major political parties, secret societies, media empires and the military (viaNATO, for instance), are controlled by the same families who sit at the top ofthe biggest pyramids. In the end there is a global pyramid that encompasses allthe others, the biggest “doll” if you like. At the capstone of this you willfind the most elite of the Illuminati, the “purest” of their bloodlines. In thisway, they can coordinate through apparently unconnected, even “opposing” areasof society, the same policies because all roads lead eventually to them –everything from the food we eat; the water we drink; the “medical care” wereceive, including vaccines; the “news” we watch and read; the “entertainment”we are given; the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces thewill of the governments; and the hard drug network aimed at destroying youngpeople. The same families and their gofers control all of these areas and somuch more. This pyramid structure is how they have manipulated the explosion ofcentralisation in every area of life: government, finance, business, media andmilitary. It is not by accident or natural occurrence, it is by coldlycalculated design. The outstanding Australian journalist John Pilger produced arare and excellent exposé of globalisation for British Independent Television inJuly 2001 in which he pointed out that just 200 corporations are now responsiblefor a quarter of the world’s economic activity. But there is another level tothis that we urgently need to understand. This pyramid system means that those‘200’ corporations are, in effect, one Corporation controlled by the same force.Globalisation, which I and other “conspiracy theorists” were writing about longbefore it became fashionable, is just another name for the Illuminati’scentralised global fascist state, which I have been exposing since the early1990s. “Globalisation” is not just a group of greedy corporations seeking tomaximise profit, it is far, far, bigger than that.Manipulating the herdMost people find it impossible to accept that a few people can manipulate thelives of billions and operate through all institutions and countries. Iunderstand that; but once you have the pyramids in place and you know how tocondition the mind and reality of the population, it is relativelystraightforward. When a few people wish to control and direct a mass of humanitythere are certain key structures that have to be in place. These are the samewhether you are seeking to manipulate an individual, family, tribe, town,country, continent or planet. First you have to impose the ‘norms’, what isconsidered right and wrong, possible or impossible, sane or insane, good andbad. Most of the people will follow those ‘norms’ without question because ofthe baa-baa, herd mentality that has prevailed within the collective human mindfor at least thousands of years. Second, you have to make life very unpleasantfor those few who challenge your imposed ‘norms’.The most effective way to do this is to ensure that it is, in effect, a crime tobe different. You make those who voice a different view, version of ‘truth’ andlifestyle, stand out like a black sheep in the human herd. You have alreadyconditioned the herd to accept your norms as its reality and, through arroganceand ignorance, they ridicule or condemn those with a different spin on life.This pressurises the black sheep to conform and serves as a warning to thoseothers in the herd who are also thinking of breaking away or challenging theprevailing reality. There is a Japanese saying that goes, “Don’t be a nail thatstands out above the rest because that’s the first one to get hit.” I could notput it better. This fear of being different and voicing a view that challengesthe “norms” is overwhelmingly the fear of what other people will think of us. Inreality, the fear of what the sheep around us will say and do if we seek toleave the herd and question its conditioned assumptions. This mentality createsa situation fundamental to the few controlling the many because it means thatthe masses are policing themselves and keeping each other in line. The sheepbecome the sheepdog for the rest of the herd. It is like a prisoner trying toescape while the rest of his cellmates rush to stop him. If that happened wewould say the prisoners were crazy, how could they do that? But humans are doingprecisely the same to each other every day by demanding that everyone conform tothe ‘norms’ to which they blindly conform. This is nothing less thanpsychological fascism – the thought police with agents in every home,everywhere. Agents so deeply conditioned that most have no idea they are unpaidmind controllers. ‘I’m just doing what’s right for my children’, I hear themsay. No, what you have been programmed to believe is right for them and thebelief, also, that only you know best.We see this same theme in our daily experiences of people in uniform and othersfrom the masses who are promoted to power over the masses. It’s summed up by thesatirical version of the British Labour Party song The Red Flag, which goes:“The working class can kiss my arse, I’ve got the foreman’s job at last.” Thisis all part of the divide and rule strategy so vital to ensuring that the herdwill police itself. Everyone plays a part in everyone else’s mental, emotionaland physical imprisonment. All the controllers have to do is set the ‘norms’,pull the right strings at the right time, and make their human puppets dance tothe appropriate tune. This they do by dictating what is taught in what webravely call ‘education’ and controlling what passes for ‘news’ through theIlluminati-owned media. In this way they can dictate to the unthinking,unquestioning herd what it should believe about itself, other people, life,history and current events. Once you set the ‘norms’ there is no need to controlevery journalist or reporter or government official. The media and theinstitutions take their ‘truth’ from those same ‘norms’ and official statements,and therefore ridicule and condemn by reflex action anyone who offers anothervision of reality. I turned on the text service on the UK’s IndependentTelevision to see a story that I was appearing on the Sci-Fi Channel to speakabout my “bizarre” views. Whoever wrote that report has never met me, never readmy books, and has never done any investigation of these subjects for his or herself. But my views must be “bizarre” to this media person because they aredifferent to those accepted by their conditioned mind. Once you control what isconsidered ‘normal’ and possible, the whole system virtually runs itself.Obeying the lawIt is these hybrid Illuminati bloodlines, manifesting as political leaders andadministrators of government, that introduce the ‘laws’ that will best servetheir plan to keep humanity in ongoing servitude. The laws, which the masseshave no say in creating, are then enforced by members of those same masses –soldiers, policemen, security guards and so on. These guys, and many womentoday, are mere system fodder. They are not encouraged to think for themselvesand it would not be good for promotion if they did. They are paid to do as theyare told, carry out orders and administer the letter of the ‘law’ – the law ofthe elite families. I remember watching a car park attendant at a botanicalgarden where many families were enjoying a Sunday afternoon out. He strode upand down constantly checking every car in turn looking for any that hadoutstayed their ticket. When he found one he was positively orgasmic. My fatherused to say that rules and regulations are for the guidance of the intelligentand the blind obedience of the idiot. But how many of those in the peaked capsadminister the law in a sensible, every-case-on-its-merits, think-for-yourselfmanner? A mere fraction, and often they are far from popular with those higherup the ladder. Soldiers don’t ask for justification for blowing away men, womenand children they have never met and know nothing about (see Afghanistan, forexample). They don’t question their superiors about why they have to commitgenocide. They just do it because they are told to do it and those doing thetelling are themselves carrying out orders from those above them. In the end,all lines of command lead ever upwards to the 13 family bloodlines and theiroffshoots as they orchestrate their agenda to take over the planet.The sheepleThe self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniform oradministrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who imposetheir conditioning on their children and pressure them to follow theirreligious, political, economic and cultural ‘norms’. One extreme example isthose who insist that their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because ofthe rules of their ludicrous religion. There are the children of Jehovah’sWitnesses who have been denied life-saving blood transfusions because theirbrain-dead parents insist on conducting every aspect of their lives according tothe contradictory dictates of a book purveying so many stories of pure fantasy.The creation of the mental and emotional sheep pen of ‘norms’ that imprisons 99%of humanity goes on minute by minute in subtle and less subtle ways. There arechildren of Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu parents who don’t accept thereligion, but still follow it because they don’t want to upset their family.Then there is the almost universal fear of what people think of us if we speak adifferent version of reality or live a different kind of life. Note that thefear for those who wish to break out of the sheep pen is not the fear of whatthe elite families, the Illuminati or ‘Illuminated Ones’, will think of them.Most have no idea that such a network exists. No, the fear is of what theirmother or father will think, or their friends and workmates – the very peoplewho are conditioned by the system to stay in the pen. The sheep are keeping theother sheep in line and making life unpleasant for anyone who tries to escape.The herd goes to war – with itselfIt is so easy for a small group of interbreeding family bloodlines to controlthe lives (in other words, the minds) of billions, once the key institutions of‘information’ are in place, as they have been for thousands of years in theirvarious forms. There are not enough of these manipulators and their stooges tocontrol the population physically and so they have had to create a structure inwhich humans control themselves through mental, emotional and, increasingly,physical imposition. Once you have the herd mentality policing itself, there isa third phase in this entrapment of human consciousness. You create factionswithin the herd and set them to war with each other. This is done by creating‘different’ belief systems (which are not different at all) and bringing theminto conflict. These belief systems are known as religions, political parties,economic theories and ‘isms’ of endless variety. These beliefs are perceived as‘opposites’ when, as I pointed out in my book, I Am Me, I Am Free, they areopposames. The vision of reality and possibility within the pen is so limitedthat it contains no opposites and the elite have to create the perception ofthem to manufacture the divisions that allow them to divide and rule. I mean,what is the difference between a Christian bishop, Jewish rabbi, Muslim or Hindupriest, or a follower of Buddha, imposing their beliefs on their children andothers? There is none because while the belief they seek to indoctrinate may beslightly different, often very slightly, the overall theme is exactly the same –the imposition of one person’s belief on another. Look at the opposames inpolitics. The Far Left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia, introducedcentralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. The‘opposite’ of this was the Far Right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler. What did heimpose? Centralised control, military dictatorship and concentration camps. Yetthese two opposames were set at war with each other amid propaganda that claimedthey were opposites. The only difference between the Soviet Union and theso-called ‘West’ during the Cold War was that the Soviet Union was openlycontrolled by the few and the West was secretly controlled by the few. And whenyou get to the capstone of the pyramid you find they were the same fewcontrolling both ‘sides’. The same force operating through Wall Street and theCity of London funded all ‘sides’ in the two world wars and that’s provable (seeAnd The Truth Shall Set You Free).So the methods of manipulation can be summarised thus:> •You need to first imprison the human mind with a rigid belief and a> fundamentally limited sense of reality – the sheep pen. It doesn’t much matter> what these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigid and discourage free> thought and open-minded questioning. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism> and all the rest each make their contribution to human servitude while> apparently claiming different ‘truths’.> •You encourage those who follow these rigid beliefs to impose them on others> and make life very difficult and unpleasant for anyone who does not conform.> •You bring these beliefs into conflict, so ensuring the divide and rule you so> desperately need for control by the few.

One I have dubbed‘problem-reaction-solution’ and the other I term the ‘Totalitarian Tiptoe’ orthe ‘stepping-stones approach’. These have been used for thousands of years toadvance the agenda and, together with fear, they remain the most effectiveweapons of the Illuminati. Since I first used the term problem-reaction-solutionas an alternative to its previous name, the “Hegelian Dialectic”, it has beenconstantly repeated among conspiracy researchers and others communicating thetechniques of control. This is fantastic because to understand this simple, butdevastating, method of human manipulation is to become so much harder to fool.Problem-reaction-solution is the key to understanding what really happened onSeptember 11th 2001 and why. It works like this: you know that if you openlypropose to remove basic freedoms, start a war or centralise power, there will bea public reaction against it. So you don’t openly and honestly propose suchplans, you play the P–R–S scam. At stage one you create a problem. It could be acountry attacking another, a government or economic collapse, or a “terroristattack”. Anything in fact that the public will think requires a ‘solution’. Atstage two, you report the ‘problems’ you have covertly created in the way youwish the people to perceive them. Crucially you find someone to blame for theproblem, a “patsy” like Lee Harvey Oswald when President Kennedy wasassassinated or Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma. You spin the background to theseevents in a way that encourages the people to demand that “something must bedone”. These are the words you want to hear because they allow you to move on tostage three, the sting. At this point you openly offer the solutions to theproblems you have yourself created. These solutions, of course, involve thecentralisation of power, the sacking of officials or politicians that aregetting in your way, and the removal of more basic freedoms as you advancefurther to your global fascist state. Just ponder on the freedoms that have beenremoved because of 9/11. A more subtle part of the technique is to propose farmore extreme changes than you expect to get away with because this allows anyopposition to think you have compromised and met them halfway. But you know thatyou have other “problems” in the pipeline to push the agenda on.With this technique you can so manipulate the public mind that people willdemand or at least allow you to introduce what, in normal circumstances, theywould vehemently oppose. The Oklahoma bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Building onApril 19th 1995 was a problem-reaction-solution classic, as I explained in AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free and will expand upon later. What followed the deathand destruction in Oklahoma were “anti-terrorism” laws that sailed throughCongress without challenge and removed fundamental freedoms from Americanpeople. Since September 11th this agenda has been advanced in gigantic leaps. Idon’t share the attitudes of people like Timothy McVeigh, nor do I defenddisturbed people like Osama bin Laden, but that’s not the point. Establishingthe truth of what happened is the point, no matter what the views and attitudesof those involved. I think it is called justice. The two most effectiveproblem-reaction-solutions in the 20th century were the two global wars. Theychanged the face of the world, as wars always do, and led to a massivecentralisation of power. The United Nations, like its predecessor the League ofNations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojan horse, or stalking horse,for world government.Media poodles … woof, woof, lick, lickThe media play their part to perfection in these ‘problem-reaction-solution’scenarios. At ownership level, people like Rupert Murdoch of the NewsCorporation know what is going on. The editors they appoint might know somethingabout it, as may certain columnists, but most of the journalists will have noidea. The editor is always there to block anything they write that is againstthe interests of the Illuminati – as directed by the owner – and if they insiston pursuing an unwelcome story they find themselves looking for another job.Most of the “information” that journalists present comes from official(Illuminati) sources anyway. In the immediate aftermath of a major event such asSeptember 11th where are the reporters getting their information? From officialsources. Name me a single piece of relevant information broadcast by themainstream media about what happened on 9/11, how it was done, who did it andwhat the retaliation should be, that did not come from official sources.Exactly. Nothing. We are told that White House sources say this, FBI sources saythat, and CIA or Pentagon sources say the other. This is how the Illuminatitransmit through the media the version of events they wish the public tobelieve. These reports are blazed across the front pages of newspapers and thetop of radio and television news bulletins throughout the world, and what theysay becomes the ‘norm’, the official “history”. In the weeks and months thatfollow, researchers who are interested in the real truth begin to dig away. Overand over they establish and document the proof of how the official version was alie from start to finish. But where are their reports published? Insmall-circulation newsletters, self-published books, and on radio stations thatoperate with a fraction of the money and potential audience of the Illuminatiempires. Therefore, years after the official version has been demolished itstill prevails in the public mind. Stop anyone in London, New York, Cape Town,Sydney, anywhere, and ask them what happened on September 11th, or in Oklahoma,the Second World War, or Kosovo. Almost every time they will give you theofficial story because that is the only one they have heard.Stepping stonesThe bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach, orthe Totalitarian Tiptoe, as I call it. You know where you intend to lead people,but you realise that if you gave them the true picture or went there in onegiant leap, you would, once again, face substantial opposition. So you travel toyour destination in little steps and each one is presented in isolation and asunconnected to all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to globalcentralisation. This technique was used most obviously with the fascistsuperstate now known as the European Union. After the war if the politicians hadsuggested a centralised Europe with common laws and currency there would havebeen an outcry. People would have said they had been fighting Hitler to stopjust such a European dictatorship and there was no way they were acceptinganother. To overcome this, the Illuminati offered a ‘free trade area’ and evenused the problem of their manipulated world wars to encourage more cooperationbetween the countries of Europe. Once they had the free trade area, however, thefoot in the door, they began to expand its powers until it became the fullyfledged political and economic dictatorship that it is today. The same ishappening with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and Asia PacificEconomic Co-operation (APEC), the ‘free trade area’ for Asia and Australia, andthe same is planned for the African Union that replaced the Organisation ofAfrican Unity in 2001. I said in And The Truth Shall Set You Free in 1995 thatthe NAFTA ‘free trade area’ would be expanded to the whole of the Americas asthe next stepping stone to a centrally controlled American Union. In 2001,George W. Bush, an Illuminati bloodline, attended the Summit of the Americas inQuebec, Canada, at which this expansion of NAFTA throughout the Americas wasagreed.Look at today’s newspapers and television news bulletins and you’ll see theproblem-reaction-solution and stepping-stones techniques played out day afterday. One extremely effective way to see through this manipulation is to keepasking yourself a simple question when faced with these daily situations: ‘Whobenefits from me believing this version of events, or accepting the solutionsand changes being offered as a result?’ The answer will be almost every time:anyone who wishes to centralise power and suppress more of our freedoms.Blind faithOver thousands of years, religion has brilliantly served this structure forhuman control. Religions have created rigid belief systems that should never bequestioned. They have imposed those beliefs through fear, indoctrination,isolation, and the mass genocide of non–believers. They have fought each otherfor dominance of the human mind, thus producing an explosion of opportunity forthe Illuminati to divide and rule for millennia. Another question: “is it morelikely that an Illuminati that has its origins in the ancient past, long beforethese religions were created, just happened to ‘get lucky’ when such a perfectvehicle for human control independently emerged? … or is it rather more probablethat these institutions of human enslavement were purposely created by thesevery same Illuminati to advance their agenda?” Look at where the major religionsoriginated – in the very Middle/Near East where the Illuminati had its ancientheadquarters. In the aftermath of 9/11 we have seen Islam used to manipulate thepeople, and all the religions are used in the same way when the situation suits.But religion is not the conspiracy, and nor are economics, politics and all therest. They are part of a vast web of interconnected manipulation designed topersuade the masses to put themselves in prison and throw away the key. TheIlluminati work through every belief system – religious, political, economic,racial and cultural – and through every side in the major ‘debates’. The reasonis simple. If you want to know the outcome of a game before the game has evenstarted, you need to control all sides. The manager of a football team cannotdictate the result if he only controls one side. If, however, he is managingboth sides, he can ensure the result he wants before a ball is kicked. So it iswith the Illuminati, the hidden hand behind the events that affect our lives andour world every day. We should be aware when contemplating the events in NewYork, Washington, and Pennsylvania that the Illuminati operate through secretsocieties in the Near and Middle East every bit as much as they do in the UnitedStates and the so-called “West”.We see this manipulation of both sides in the protests against globalisation. Tocontrol the public perception of these gathering protests the Illuminati haveorganised their own agents provocateur to start the violence we see on the newsbroadcasts. For example, mainstream journalists watched the police lines open ata protest in Spain to allow a group with weapons and masked faces to walkthrough to the peacefully protesting crowd. This group then started to attackeach other, thus ‘justifying’ a police charge on the peaceful gathering in whichpeople were battered by these uniformed head cases. Once the police interventionhad begun, the journalists watched the group who started the trouble walk calmlyback through the police lines to be driven away in police vehicles. One wasasked if he was a policeman. “Yes” was his first reply when caught off-guard,but then he denied it. The manipulation of public perception goes on before oureyes minute by minute. September 11th was the most obvious example of this Ihave yet seen.Fresh air “money”One of the most important aspects of the bloodline-Illuminati control ofhumanity is the money system. The Illuminati financial sting is very simple andspans the period from Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is based oncreating money that doesn’t exist and lending it to people and businesses inreturn for interest. This creates an enormous debt for governments, business andthe general population and you therefore control them. Vital to this has beenpermitting bankers to lend money they do not have. If you or me have a millionpounds we can lend a million pounds. Very simple. But if a bank has a millionpounds it can lend ten times that and more, and charge interest on it. If even afraction of the people who theoretically have money deposited in a bank wenttoday to remove it, the banks would slam the door in half an hour because theydon’t have it. Money in the bank is a myth, another confidence trick. When yougo into a bank and ask for a loan, the bank does not print a single new note,nor mint a single new coin. It merely types the amount of the loan into youraccount. From that moment you are paying interest to the bank on what is no morethan figures typed on a screen. However, if you fail to pay back thatnon-existent loan, the bank can come along and quite legally take your wealththat does exist, your home, land, car and possessions, to the estimated value ofwhatever figure was typed on to that screen – plus interest. More than that,because money is not brought into circulation by governments, but by privatebanks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money is incirculation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money is incirculation. What is the difference between an economic boom (prosperity) and aneconomic depression (poverty)? One thing only – the amount of money incirculation. Through this system, the private banks, controlled by the sameIlluminati families, decide how much money will be in circulation. They cantherefore create booms and busts at will. It is the same with the stock marketsthrough which these families are moving trillions of dollars a day around thefinancial and banking system and deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash.Stock market crashes don’t just happen – they are made to happen. Why would theIlluminati do this when they have so much money invested in these markets? Wellif you know the crash is coming because you are going to cause it, you know tosell at the highest point and buy back in once the crash has happened. In thisway you can increase your holdings massively by acquiring companies at afraction of the cost before your manipulated collapse.Most of the “money” in circulation is not physical money: cash and coins. It isrepresented by figures passing from one computer account to anotherelectronically via money transfers, credit cards and chequebooks. The moremoney, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economicactivity can take place and the more products are bought and sold, the moreincome people have, and the more jobs are available. But a constant theme ofthis Illuminati financial coup has been to create a boom by making lots of loansand then pulling the plug, causing a depression or crash. Overpaid economistsand economic correspondents, most of whom have no idea what is going on, willtell you that boom and bust is part of some natural “economic cycle”. It is not.It is systematic manipulation by the Illuminati to steal the real wealth of theworld. During a boom many people get themselves into more debt. The vibranteconomic activity means that businesses borrow more for new technology toincrease production to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house anda more expensive car because they are so confident of their economic prospects.Then, at the most opportune moment, the major banks, coordinated by theIlluminati network, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans andbegin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewerloans than before. This has the effect of taking units of exchange (money in itsvarious forms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leadsto fewer jobs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate thenecessary economic activity. People and businesses can no longer earn enough torepay their loans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their realwealth, their business, home, land, car and other possessions – in return fornon-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen.This has been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the lastfew centuries, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of thepopulation and into the hands of those who control the banking system – theIlluminati bloodline families. The same applies to countries. Instead ofcreating their own interest-free money, governments borrow it from the privatebanking cartel and pay the interest and the capital (sometimes) by taxation ofthe people. A fantastic amount of the money that you pay in taxes goes straightto the private banks to pay back loans of “money” that governments could createthemselves interest free! Why don’t they do it? Simple. The Illuminati controlthe governments as much as they control the banks. What we call “privatisation”is the selling of state assets in response to bank-created debt. The world’spoorest countries are handing over control of their land and resources to theIlluminati bankers because they can’t pay back the vast loans made, on purpose,by the banks to ensnare them in this very situation. The world does not have tobe in poverty and conflict. It is manipulated to be that way because it servesthe agenda. “Third World” debt was manufactured to replace physical occupationof resource-rich or strategically situated countries under colonialism withtoday’s financial occupation. The way they created this situation is told indetail in And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Once a country is indebted toforeign banks, even though the money is non-existent credit, they are forced tohand over control of their affairs to the bankers, the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund, which then dictate economic and social policy atevery level. In the end all roads not only lead to the same cabal, they alsolead to the same word: control.Criminal bankruptcyWhen you begin to look behind the movie screen or, more appropriately, under thestone, you see a very different world to the one portrayed on CNN. Someresearchers and lawyers suggest that in the 1930s the United States, Britain,France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and many others officially declaredbankruptcy, but somehow forgot to tell the people. This apparently happenedduring the five years of Geneva Conventions in Switzerland between 1928 and1932, but it seems that they don’t publish the volume containing details of thebankruptcy declarations. The bankers said that either the countries declaredbankruptcy to the Illuminati banks or there would be no loans to get them out ofthe deep global depression at that time. So they accepted official bankruptcy tothe global banking system and this meant, in effect, that the banks have ownedthose countries ever since.7 Actually, I say countries. In fact, the UnitedStates is not a country, but a corporation, as revealed in my previous books anda stream of other published works and studies. No doubt we will find that thesituation is the same in other countries too. This bankruptcy is actually in theUnited States Congressional Record of March 17th 1993 (Vol. 33, page H-1303).James Traficant Jr of Ohio told the House:> “Members of Congress are official trustees presiding over the greatest> reorganization of any Bankrupt entity in world history, the US Government.

The UScorporation was created behind the screen of a “Federal Government” when, afterthe manufactured “victory” in the American War of Independence”, the Britishcolonies exchanged overt dictatorship from London with the far more effectivecovert dictatorship that has been in place ever since. In effect, the VirginiaCompany, the corporation headed by the British Crown that controlled the former“colonies”, simply changed its name to the United States and other relatedpseudonyms. These include, today, the United States, US, USA, United States ofAmerica, Washington DC, District of Columbia, Federal Government and “Feds”. TheUnited States Corporation is based in the District of Columbia (Queen Semiramis)and the current president of the corporation is a man called George W. Bush. Heis not the president of the people or the country as they are led to believe,that’s just the smokescreen. This means that Bush launched a “war on terrorism”on behalf of a private corporation to further the goals of that Corporation. Ithad nothing to do with “America” and “Americans” because these are verydifferent legal entities. It is the United States Corporation that owns the USmilitary and everything else that comes under the term “federal”. This includesthe Federal Reserve, the “central bank” of the United States, which is, inreality, a private bank owned by controlling stockholders (and controllers ofthe US Corporation) that are not even American. This is the bank from which theUnited States Corporation borrows “money” that is repaid with interest by theunknowing American taxpayers. The Federal Reserve was manipulated into being in1913 and dictates the US interest rate that has a massive knock-on effect on therest of the world. The Federal Reserve or “Fed” is currently headed by AlanGreenspan, a member of Illuminati front organisations like the Bilderberg Group,Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission. His predecessor was PaulW. Volker of ... the Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations andTrilateral Commission (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The United StatesCorporation is owned by families and forces in Europe and the Jesuit-controlledVatican is very much part of this covert ownership of not only the US, but majorEuropean “countries” also.Aye, aye, captain, er, judgeThe privately owned corporation known as the United States is the holdingcompany, if you like, and the 50 states are its subsidiaries. Therefore thesestates also declared bankruptcy, or had it declared for them by the holdingcompany, the “Federal Government”, but the people never knew and still don’t.You can get the detail about this elsewhere and I am only summarising thesituation to give people an idea of how deep this conspiracy really goes. Thesting has been set up so that when you register with the “Federal Government” inany way by accepting a Social Security number, driver’s licence, or any of theother official federal documents, you are, unknowingly, agreeing to become anasset-employee of the United States Corporation. From that moment you becomeresponsible for financing the corporation’s state of bankruptcy. When you paytaxes or a court or parking fine and such like, you are servicing the bankruptcyby paying that money to “government agencies” that are nothing more thandebt-collecting agencies for the “creditor” banks. The US court system operatesunder corporate law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to administer thebankruptcy and fleece the sheep to pay back the ongoing debt. This is also knownas British Maritime (military) Law and this is why the American flag always hasa gold fringe when displayed in the courts of the United States, and you findthe same in government buildings, federally funded schools and on US militaryuniforms. The gold fringe is a legal symbol indicating that the court is sittingunder British Maritime Law and the Uniform Commercial Code – military andmerchant law not common or constitutional law. Under the Admiralty Law of Flagsthe flag displayed gives notice of the law under which the ship (in this casethe court) is regulated. Anyone entering that ship (court) accepts by doing sothat they are submitting to the law indicated by that flag. Judges refuse toreplace the flag with one without a fringe when asked by defendants who know thescore because that changes the law under which the court is sitting. If youappear in a court with a gold-fringed flag your constitutional rights aresuspended and you are being tried under British Maritime (military/merchant)Law. The Uniform Commercial Code was approved by the American Bar Association,which is a franchise, a subordinate branch, of the British legal system and itshierarchy. As I have been writing for many years, the power that controlsAmerica is based in Britain and Europe (very much including the Vatican) becausethat is where the power is located that owns the United States Corporation. Bythe way, if you think it is strange that a court on dry land could beadministered under Maritime Law, look at US Code, Title 18 B 7. It says thatAdmiralty Jurisdiction is applicable in the following locations: (1) the highseas; (2) any American ship; (3) any lands reserved or acquired for the use ofthe United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof,or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent ofthe legislature of the state. In other words, mainland America. All this isfounded on Roman law because the Illuminati have been playing this same gamethroughout the centuries wherever they have gone. The major politicians knowthat this is how things are and so do the government administrators, the judgesand lawyers, and insider “journalists”.Those who realise what is happening and ask the court for the name of the truecreditor or recipients of the fines imposed by the “legal system” are alwaysrefused this information by the judge. The reason is simple. The true creditorsin such cases and the ultimate recipient of the fines are the bankers to whichthe corporation “country” is bankrupt. This is why more and more people in theUS are refusing to register in any way with the Federal Government as news anddocumentation of this bizarre situation continues to circulate. If theauthorities can keep this fantastic deceit from the mass of the people since the1930s you can appreciate why they were confident they could ensure that whatreally happened on September 11th stays comfortably under wraps. Throughout thisbook I will refer to what is thought to be the government of “America” as theUnited States or the US and, when I talk of the “US government” and similarterms, I am referring to the privately owned United States Corporation that ismasquerading as the “government.” It is not the government of a nation orcountry, it is a private corporation acting purely in the interests of thefamilies that own and control it. The “American” president is simply thecorporation’s chief executive officer.What we can doThere are two ways to meet a problem. We can look for a solution or, far moreeffectively, we can remove the cause. I go into these areas in detail in myother books and talks, and I will return to this at the end of this one. But onekey “cause” we need to eliminate is the way we allow ourselves to be divided andruled along the fault lines of race, religion, political persuasion, incomebracket, and the other virtually endless list of human conflicts and divisions.If a major cause of human control is division then to remove it we must unite,simple as that. We will never agree on everything and nor should we. What aboring world it would be if we did. But that does not mean we can’t unite behindwhat we do agree on, and come together to protect and restore the freedoms thataffect us all. Right wing, left wing, black, white, Christian, Muslim or Jew,everyone is a target for the Illuminati’s global fascist state. Unless peoplestop fighting among themselves in their arrogant and meaningless battles forsuperiority, we will all be divided and ruled in a global version of NaziGermany or Communist Russia and China.I don’t care what your religion may be, or your race or political belief.Whatever it is, you are entitled to it and you can do what you like for all Icare, so long as you don’t seek to impose your will and belief on others. What Icare about is the right of everyone to be free to follow his or her own freelychosen path through this Great Illusion we call the ‘physical’ world. But foreach of us to be truly free, we all have to be truly free. The loss of anotherperson’s freedom is a loss of our own also. The murder of a child in Afghanistanis no less important than the murder of a child in New York, nor vice versa. Weare in this together and we need to grow up and come together. The number ofpeople knowingly manipulating the Illuminati agenda is a tiny fraction of theglobal population. They can only do it with our agreement and cooperationthrough self-interest, ignorance or terminal apathy. The pyramids of control areonly there because we are holding them together. The power of a pyramid is atthe bottom, not the top, yet we seem blind to that fact. The Illuminati are onlyup there because we are holding them up there.Our response must be peaceful because to meet violence with violence and hatredwith hatred makes those who protest a mirror of those they protest against. Whatwe fight we become, and it is vital that we don’t fight the Illuminati and theglobal agenda, but instead cease to cooperate with it. Peaceful, united,non-cooperation with the system of control and dictatorship is by far the mosteffective means of bringing down these networks of power. Instead of fightingthe pyramids we need to walk away from them and watch them fall by themselvesonce our cooperation ceases to hold them together. We are watching a daily moviewhile believing it is real. But it’s not. It is the veil behind which thishighly malevolent Illuminati agenda can operate in the secrecy that isfundamental to its success. With every week the movie is being exposed for whatit is, a virtual-reality illusion designed to imprison the human collectivemind. We can no longer justify a lack of response by a lack of knowledge. Theinformation is available for anyone who truly wishes to know. So what are you –we – going to do about it? That is the question that everyone must now considerif the Illuminati are going to be denied their global concentration camp, theglobal sweat shop, that is unfolding daily before our eyes.I hope this short explanation has helped you to glimpse some of the astonishingmanipulation that hides behind the “movie” that is sold to us by the authoritiesand reported by the media.

Surely before we make decisionsabout what to believe we need to know if those who have peddled the officialversion of events can be trusted to tell us the truth. The next three chapterswill be full of names and interconnecting subjects, and I can understand thatsome may find it overwhelming at times, but without this information it is notpossible to appreciate the true context of September 11th and as this bookunfolds that will become obvious. First of all, these “world leaders” arenothing like as powerful as people think they are, except over those below themin the Illuminati pyramid. Like all the personnel in government, even atapparently exalted levels, they are puppets of a higher authority in the hiddenhierarchy that does not put itself on public display. The President of theUnited States, as with the Prime Minister of the UK and elsewhere, is a positionfor lieutenants of the Illuminati, not generals or colonels. They are used toplay out the game in the public arena and, so long as they do that and say whatthey are told to say, their careers will flourish and their horrendous secretswill remain “in-house”. Fail to serve the dragon, however, and you press theself-destruct button, as with John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby. There arethose, like the Bush family and Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, whowillingly and enthusiastically dance to the Illuminati tune and take the “power”and rewards that come with that. Others are caught in the web and believe thereis nothing they can do except comply. Here I will present just some of thebackground to the famous political faces that have dominated the post 9/11 era.I emphasise the word “some” because there is far more to know than I can detailin a few chapters, and you can find more information in my other books like AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret, Children Of The Matrix, and along list of publications by other authors and researchers (see Bibliography[../Text/index_split_032.html#filepos2032844]).The Bush familyThe Bushes have been one of the most active Illuminati families, at a “gofer”level, for at least the last century or so. They have produced two US presidentsand as both are called George Bush I will overcome the potential confusion inthe text by calling George H.W. Bush either George Bush or “Father George”, andI’ll refer to his son, the current incumbent, as George W. Bush, “Boy George”,or “Dubya”. As U.S presidents go, Father George is quite high up in theIlluminati compared with most of them, but he’s still small fry compared withthose who really call the shots. His son, George “Dubya”, of course, can justabout summon the brain-cell activity to tie his shoelaces. I blame theinbreeding myself. Father George and wife Barbara are both descendants ofGodfroi de Boullion (also known as Godfrey of Boullion) who, in 1099, ledEuropean noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from theIslamic faith and moved into the King’s palace at Temple Mount, the alleged siteof Solomon’s Temple, which has been an historic obsession for the Illuminatithat continues to the present time. Understanding this obsession is tounderstand so much about the terrible events in Jerusalem and the focus onTemple Mount by the religions of Christian, Jew and Muslim. Godfroi de Boullionwas the first King of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major regionfor the Illuminati bloodline to this day (see The Biggest Secret). So whenGeorge W. Bush, a descendant of de Boullion through both his mother and father,talked of a “Crusade” against “Islamic” terrorism after September 11th, that wasno slip of the tongue or unfortunate gaffe as it was reported. He knew exactlywhat he was saying and why. From this “Crusade” by de Boullion came the secretsociety called the Knights Templar, which is widely exposed in my other books.The Knights Templar is still a major arm of the Illuminati today with top peoplein global politics, banking, business and media among its initiates. It waslargely through the Knights Templar that the Freemasons, the world’s biggestsecret society, emerged.George and Barbara Bush are from the Pierce bloodline that changed its name fromPercy after fleeing England in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot led by Guy Fawkes(or so they say) to blow up the English Parliament and kill King James I in1605. This event is still celebrated in the UK every November 5th when effigiesof Guy Fawkes are burned on bonfires all over the country. The Bush ancestorThomas Percy was one of the main plotters. George and Barbara Pierce Bush (ofMerrill, Lynch, Fenner and Smith) are from the same bloodline as the USPresident, Franklin Pierce, who was in the White House from 1853 to 1857. OtherBush relatives include the Grosvenor families of England and America, the Taftsof Ohio, who produced William Howard Taft, president from 1909 to 1913, and theDelano-Roosevelts, who provided President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933–45)and Theodore Roosevelt (1901–19). The English Grosvenors are the Dukes ofWestminster who own prime properties in the City of London, one of the mainfinancial and secret society centres for the Illuminati globally. The Grosvenorsof America founded the National Geographic which is notorious for removing thearchaeological treasures of the world, especially those with religioussignificance, and relocating them at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC.The Institute is controlled by those Grosvenor cousins, the Smithsons, who inturn are descended from the Percys – the Pierce bloodline that produced theBushes.1 The ancestry of both George Bushes can also be traced to England’sAlfred the Great and to Charlemagne, a highly significant figure in theIlluminati and bloodline story, and from whom 34 of the 43 US presidents aredescended. With both his father and mother having such serious royal andaristocratic ancestry, this gives Baby George a mass of bloodline connections,as documented by Burke’s Peerage. The Bushes are related to the British royalfamily, who are big-time Illuminati, and the two are very close. Documentsapparently exist that reveal Bush family business dealings with the Queen ofEngland through Coutts Bank in London and if anyone can give me more detailsabout that then please let me know.Dark secrets galoreThe Bushes have long been pillars of the infamous Skull and Bones Society basedin a windowless mausoleum known as “the Tomb” alongside the campus at YaleUniversity at New Haven in Connecticut. Every year 15 bloodline students areinitiated into the Skull and Bones Society and the ratio of Skull and Bonesinitiates who end up in positions of power in politics, banking, business, mediaand intelligence agencies in the United States, in front of camera and behindthe scenes, is massively greater than the general student population. George W.Bush is a Skull and Bones initiate (code name “Temporary” interestingly), alongwith Father George Bush, and the president’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, one ofthe funders of Adolf Hitler. Prescott Bush is most famous within the Skull andBones “Order” for raiding the grave of the Native American Apache leaderGeronimo. In May 1918 Prescott Bush and five other Skull and Bones men ransackedthe grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. They took turns to stand guard while othersrobbed the grave and took away artefacts and Geronimo’s skull. This was taken tothe Skull and Bones headquarters at Yale where it is used in their sick ritualsand ceremonies. This horrible story is told in an internal history of the Skulland Bones Society and was quoted to Ned Anderson, the Tribal Chairman of the SanCarlos Apache tribe, when he was negotiating to have Geronimo’s remains returnedto the tribe’s custody. A 1989 article in the New Yorker said: “One Bonesman …recalled during the early 70s seeing perhaps 30 skulls, not all of them human,scattered about the Tomb [at Yale].” 2 This is the mentality of the peoplerunning our world.The Bush men also have a long association with the diabolical rituals performedby the Illuminati bloodlines every July at a place called Bohemian Grove,located in 2,700 acres of very secluded redwood forest near the hamlet of MonteRio in Sonoma County, 75 miles north of San Francisco. This is a ritual andsexual playground for leading American and foreign politicians, mobsters,bankers, businessmen, media owners and editors, top entertainers, etc., who areinitiates of the Illuminati or serve the agenda in some form. Among them arepeople like Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan; VicePresident Dick Cheney; Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George Shultz,Casper Weinberger and Bush family crony, James Baker; Alexander Haig, the formerUS Defense Secretary; Alan Greenspan, the head of the Illuminati’s US “centralbank”, the Federal Reserve; David Rockefeller, Illuminati manipulator for atleast 50 years; television news anchorman Walter Cronkite; David Gergen, authorand adviser to presidents for 30 years and editor-at-large at US News and WorldReport; and presidents of major media operations like CNN and the AssociatedPress. In July 1991, Dirk Mathison, the San Francisco bureau chief of Peoplemagazine, owned by the Illuminati’s Time–Warner, sneaked into the Grove threetimes. On the third occasion he was recognised by a Time Warner executive whothrew him out and his story was not allowed to appear. Mathison said that JohnLehman, a former secretary of the Navy, delivered a lecture at the Grove thatrevealed how the Pentagon estimated 200,000 Iraqis had been killed a few monthsearlier in the Gulf War – a figure not made public. Another speaker at thesecret Grove gathering was Al Neuharth, the founder of USA Today, who wasidentified in the official programme as chairman of the Freedom Forum – a$700-million foundation dedicated to a “free press”!Cathy O’Brien, who was a mind-controlled slave of the Illuminati for some 30years, tells in her book, Trance-Formation Of America,3 of how she and herfellow mind-slaves were forced to serve the perversions of their abusers atBohemian Grove. These include satanic rituals, child sacrifices, torture andblood drinking. Cathy says in her book: “Slaves of advancing age or with failedprogramming were ritually murdered at random in the wooded grounds of the Groveand I felt it was only a matter of time before it would be me.” She says thatthe Grove has a number of rooms for different perversions, including a DarkRoom, a Leather Room, a Necrophilia Room and one known as the UndergroundLounge, spelt as U.N.derground on the sign. I know this sounds seriously far outto peoples’ conditioned sense of reality, but if you read The Biggest Secret andChildren Of The Matrix, as well as many other books by other researchers andvictims, you will see the enormous evidence to support all this. I will explainwhy they are obsessed with rituals and blood drinking in the final chapter.These bloodlines can be shown to have been involved in these sickening humansacrifice rituals since Babylon and before, and it continues to this day. In TheBiggest Secret there is a photograph of robed and hooded men at the Grovestanding alongside a large fire while worshipping a 40-foot stone owl – anancient Illuminati symbol. These world-famous Illuminati initiates at BohemianGrove burn and sacrifice a human “effigy” under the owl at the start of their“summer camp” every year. This happens during a Babylonian-type ritual calledthe Cremation of Care and in the year 2000 Alex Jones, an American radio talkshow host, took a hidden camera into the Grove and filmed the ritual. He was toofar away to see if the sacrifice was an “effigy” or real, but the humansacrifice rituals go on among the elite of the elite in much more secret andsecluded locations during the “camp”. The Jones footage clearly shows thebizarre opening ritual and the sound quality is particularly good. At one pointan “effigy” is floated on a boat across the lake at Bohemian Grove where it isplaced under the giant owl and set on fire. At this point you hear very clearlya blood-curdling scream and one of two things are happening here. They areeither sacrificing a human being in the guise of an “effigy” or they broadcastthe sound of the scream of agony as part of the ceremony. Either way, these arethe people running our world! President George W. Bush, like his father andgrandfather, is a Bohemian Grove attendee and arrived there shortly after thevideo was shot. The Jones footage appeared in a television documentary on theUK’s Channel 4 in 2001, a programme that skimmed the surface of what really goeson at the Grove and missed a wonderful opportunity. Alex Jones has a tendency toscream at the camera, which doesn’t help his case, but he does some great workinforming Americans of their plight. His own video of the Bohemian Grove footageis far better than the UK Channel 4 version and is well worth seeing. It isavailable through Infowars.com [http://www.infowars.com]The Bush drug networkAmong the most important functions of the Bush family and the Skull and BonesSociety is putting illegal drugs like cocaine and heroin on the streets ofAmerica and around the world. It was very wealthy aristocratic and otherIlluminati bloodline families in Britain and the United States that launched theglobal drug trade and still control it. They use their government agencies to“bust” any opposition and leave the field clear for themselves. This is what ishappening when you hear news reports of a “big drug find” or some villain ornetwork being jailed for trafficking. The real players never get hit becausethey also control law “enforcement”. The Illuminati drug-running network notonly makes vast sums to fund covert projects, it also destroys lives on amassive scale, and creates fear and divide and rule through the enormousdivision and crime generated by those who steal, rob and mug in a desperateattempt to get the money to feed their addiction. The Skull and Bones Society isowned by the Russell Trust, an organisation controlled by the Russells, adrug-running bloodline family. They flew the skull and bones flag on their shipsas they transported drugs for the British Empire from Turkey to China andelsewhere during the Opium Wars of the 19th century. The skull and bones is anancient Illuminati symbol used in its sacrificial rituals and secret language,not least by the Knights Templar. Samuel Russell launched Russell and Company in1823 and within seven years it had absorbed the Perkins opium syndicate based inBoston. Russell’s head of operations in Canton, China, was Warren Delano Jr, thegrandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US President during the SecondWorld War who was related to the Bush family. Roosevelt was also a cousin of hisfellow wartime leader, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Otherfamous families (Illuminati bloodline) were partners in the Russell drug network– names like Coolidge, Forbes, Perkins, Low and Sturgis. It was Samuel Russell’scousin, William Huntington, and the Bush-related Alphonso Taft, the father ofPresident William Howard Taft, who established the Order of the Skull and Bonesin the US in 1832 and attracted America’s major bloodline families to its darkrituals and grotesque agenda – families that have dominated American politics,business, banking, and covert intelligence operations. They include theRockefellers, Harrimans, Tafts, Lords, Kelloggs, Goodyears, Whitneys,Vanderbilts, Bundys, Sloanes, Perkins, and … Bushes. The Skull and Bones menhave always had a very close association with the US intelligence community andone of its most famous, or infamous, members is Father George Bush, who servedthe Illuminati and crimes against humanity as Director of the CentralIntelligence Agency. (You’ll find the detailed and sourced background to theSkull and Bones Society and the Bush connections in And The Truth Shall Set YouFree.)Prescott Bush, funder of HitlerThe current president’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a Senator forConnecticut, the home of the Skull and Bones Society. He was a golf partner ofPresident Dwight D. “Ike” Eisenhower, a military man who, like Colin Powell,enjoyed a fantastic rise to prominence because of his Illuminati sponsors. But“Ike” disappeared from view after he warned about the dangers to freedom posedby the “Military-Industrial Complex” (the Illuminati) in the closing days of hispresidency. Prescott Bush was a keen and active supporter of the eugenics(master race) movement along with his bloodline associates, the Harrimans andRockefellers. It was this clique, led by the Rockefellers, that funded the workof Adolf Hitler’s race “purity” expert, Ernst Rudin, to such an extent that hecould occupy an entire floor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy andDemography in Berlin.4 Soon after Hitler had abolished elections and becomedictator of Germany in 1933, the Rockefeller-funded, Bush andHarriman-supported, Dr Rudin was commissioned to write the Law for thePrevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity, which involved the forcedsterilisation of anyone considered genetically inferior. Father George’s massivefunding of “population control” programmes is another modern example of thisfamily obsession. Once again the detailed and horrific story of the master racemovement supported by the Bushes, Harrimans, and Rockefellers is told in And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Harry S. Truman, by the way, the Freemasonic Presidentwho ordered the atomic bombing of Japan, was a Rockefeller cousin.Prescott Bush was involved in supporting eugenics and Hitler’s crazed masterrace “philosophy”, and he was directly involved in funding the Nazi war machine.All sides in the First and Second World Wars were funded by the same people,mainly through sources in Wall Street and the City of London (see And The TruthShall Set You Free). The Illuminati use wars to change the face of society andcreate the opportunity to introduce their agenda of constant centralisation ofpower through the technique of problem-reaction-solution. They manipulatepeoples and countries into conflict and fund the genocide until the status quosociety is destroyed. Once that is achieved they can rebuild that society inline with their agenda. This is what the two world wars of the 20th century andthe endless other conflicts have really been about – including Afghanistan andthe “war on terrorism”. Prescott Bush helped to finance Hitler through a companycalled the Union Banking Corporation (UBC). Fritz Thyssen, a German steelentrepreneur and banker, funded the Nazis from the early 1920s. His bankingoperation in Germany was affiliated through a subsidiary with the W.A. HarrimanCompany in New York (Brown Brothers, Harriman after 1933), which in turn wasfunded, at least in its earlier days, by the House of Rothschild. The Harrimanfamily was prominent in supporting the Russian Revolution, Adolf Hitler and themaster race insanity of the eugenics movement. A Fritz Thyssen companycontrolled the Union Banking Corporation in the US, which had E. Roland Harriman(Skull and Bones Society) on its board along with known Nazis and Nazi financialbackers. Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of the future presidents, wasalso on the UBC board and owed his wealth to the Harrimans. The trio of BrownBrothers Harriman, the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm headed by Rockefellercousin John Foster Dulles, and the Union Banking Corporation of Prescott Bushand George Herbert Walker (Father George’s grandfather), represented theinterests of the Nazi business cartels in the United States at the time of theSecond World War. John Foster Dulles would become US Secretary of State whilehis brother, Allen, was the first head of the CIA! In 1942 the government seizedUBC assets under the Trading With The Enemy Act, and stopped George Walker andPrescott Bush pouring money into Hitler’s regime – at least in theory. Eightdays later, two other Bush-managed companies, the Holland-American TradingCorporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation, were seized for thesame reason. These were followed by another Bush-Harriman operation, theSilesian-American Corporation.The Bush-Nazi connection was highlighted again more recently by John Loftus, thepresident of the Florida Holocaust Museum, who pointed out that Prescott Bushderived a portion of his personal fortune from his affiliation with aNazi-controlled bank. Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department’sNazi War Crimes Unit, confirmed that Prescott Bush was a principal in the UnionBanking Corporation in Manhattan in the late 1930s and the 1940s, and thatleading Nazi industrialists secretly owned the bank at the time. He said theywere moving money into the UBC through a second bank in Holland even after theUnited States declared war on Germany. The bank was liquidated in 1951, Loftussaid, and President Bush’s grandfather and great-grandfather received $1.5million as part of that dissolution. He said he had a file of paperwork linkingthe bank and Prescott Bush to Nazi money. “That’s where the Bush family fortunecame from: it came from the Third Reich,” Loftus said in a speech during theSarasota Reading Festival.5 In his book, Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, The Nazisand the Swiss Banks, Loftus documented the Swiss bank accounts that harbouredfunds confiscated from concentration camp victims, and the involvement ofItalian priests in smuggling Nazi war criminals to safe havens in Canada,Central and South America, and the United States after the war. This is alsodetailed in And The Truth Shall Set You Free, which, like Loftus, exposes theNazi connections of other prominent American Illuminati families, most notablythe Rockefellers and the Kennedys. One member of the audience who heard Loftusin Florida, Nancy Krauss from Punta Gorda, said: “I am absolutely shocked. Iwish this would have come out before the election. My husband voted for Bush. Idon’t think he would have voted for him if he would have known.” 6 If peopleknew what the Bush family had really done, and are still doing, they would allbe in jail with the key hurled into a very deep ocean.Funding the Russian RevolutionThe Harrimans and their close associate, Prescott Bush, also helped to fund theRussian Revolution. E. Roland Harriman was the brother of W. Averill Harriman(Skull and Bones Society), who was a director of a company called the GuarantyTrust when it was financing Lenin and Trotsky to trigger the Russian Revolution(another Illuminati problem-reaction-solution). Half the board members of BrownBrothers Harriman and their fellow Russian Revolution financers, J.P. Morgan,were Skull and Bones initiates. Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and PercyRockefeller, were in the same Bonesmen group. Averill Harriman, the HenryKissinger of his day, would later make vast profits from Russian ventures and beappointed US Ambassador to the Soviet Union to advance Illuminati intereststhere. The US and Soviet governments were on different “sides” in the “ColdWar”? Sure they were. It was all a game to dupe the people. Averill Harriman wasalso a controlling voice in the Democratic Party and dictator to PresidentFranklin Roosevelt, he of the drug-running Illuminati bloodline related to theBushes. Harriman’s wife, Pamela, who died while US ambassador to Paris in 1997,was extremely influential in Bill Clinton’s rise to the presidency, which is whyhe made her Ambassador to France as a pay back. In turn, her husband, Averill, a“Democrat”, was very much a mentor to Prescott Bush and the Bush family ingeneral, who are “Republicans”. As one headline at the time of Bill Clinton’srun for president put it: “Bush Camp Finances Clinton Campaign”.7 Like I say,the United States, as with the UK and other countries, is a one-party statemasquerading as a free society. Whoever you vote for the government still getsin: the Illuminati government. Pamela Harriman was also married to RandolphChurchill, son of Britain’s wartime Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (bloodlineand cousin to Franklin Roosevelt) and she had affairs with the Italian Fiat bossGiovanni Agnelli (bloodline and major Illuminati major operative) and Baron Eliede Rothschild (bloodline and Illuminati operative), among a string of others.When you move in Illuminati circles, it is a very small world.George H.W. Bush – “Father George”This was the background into which George Herbert Walker Bush arrived in thisworld on June 12th 1924. He was groomed from birth to serve the Illuminati in along list of roles, including US Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman ofthe Republican Party at the time of the Watergate hearings, Director of the CIA,and Vice President and President of the United States. The Herbert Walker in hisname comes from his grandfather, George Herbert Walker (Skull and BonesSociety), another man heavily involved with Prescott Bush in the manipulation ofthe Russian Revolution, the expansion of the eugenics movement and the fundingof Hitler. The golf trophy called the Walker Cup is named after him. Whereveryou look in George Bush’s life you find Illuminati operatives, humansacrificers, child abusers and orchestrators of genocide. George Bush himself isall of these, as my books and others have well detailed. Father George is verymuch a power behind the throne during the presidency of his son, who is onlydoing what others tell him.I will summarise here just a few of the crimes against humanity inflicted byFather George Bush and his dominant partner, Henry Kissinger, another genocidalmaniac. It will give you a flavour of the true mentality behind September 11thand the subsequent “war on terrorism”. Bush served the Illuminati in China whileKissinger and the Chinese were supporting Pol Pot in the genocidal war onCambodia that led to the systematic extermination of millions of Cambodians.Bush returned home in 1975 when he received a telegram from Kissinger sayingthat he was being nominated by President Ford (Kissinger in other words) to beDirector of the CIA. Bush held the post in 1976 and 1977 and he is sofundamentally involved in CIA activities to this day that in 1999 itsheadquarters compound at Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center forIntelligence. Maybe his son should join, he could do with some. The CentralIntelligence Agency is part of the so-called “Inner Fed” of the secretgovernment that consists of the CIA, the National Security Agency, FBI, NASA andthe Federal Reserve “Central Bank of America”. It is through “umbrella”structures like the “Inner Fed” – the pyramids – that a coordinated policy andresponse can be conducted between apparently unconnected agencies andorganisations. Much of the funding of this cartel of manipulation comes from itsinvolvement in the drugs trade, which the intelligence agencies and bloodlinefamilies like the Bushes control.Father George Bush was not new to the intelligence game and his connections withthe CIA would appear to go back to the 1950s or even much earlier given theSkull and Bones Society connection to the US intelligence community. In TheImmaculate Deception,8 Russell S. Bowen names Bush as a top CIA agent sincebefore the agency’s failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba on April 17th 1961,which turned President Kennedy’s attention to reforming the CIA. Bowen, aretired brigadier general who did some of the Bush family’s dirty work, saysthat Bush worked with a man named Felix Rodriguez and other anti-Castro Cubans.9Intriguingly, the top secret code name of the Bay of Pigs invasion was“Operation Zapata”. Bush’s oil company was called Zapata Oil. Rodriguez wouldturn up again in the Iran-Contra arms-for-drugs scandal during the Reagan-Bushadministration, which made vast quantities of hard drugs available to the youngpeople of the United States. When you look at the personnel in the “PlumbersGroup” involved in the Watergate break-in in 1972, a remarkable number of themwere also involved in the Bay of Pigs debacle. William Buckley, a CIAcoordinator, said that if he told what he knew about the Bay of Pigs and theKennedy assassination “it would be the biggest scandal ever to rock thenation”.10 Buckley would later be assassinated in the Middle East. There isplenty of evidence that George Bush was a long-time CIA asset since before theKennedy assassination when the family friend and Hitler supporter, Allen Dulles,was head of the CIA. The Dulles family are bloodline and cousins to theRockefellers. President Kennedy sacked Allen Dulles in a purge in which JFKthreatened to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces, but before he could dothat he was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, in 1963 and the same AllenDulles was appointed to the Warren Commission to decide who killed him! There isevidence to suggest that George Bush was far closer to the Kennedy assassinationthan people have believed.11Father George at the CIAFrom his office at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Bush put togetherhis team. Among them was the infamous Theodore Shackley, whom Bush named as theCIA’s associate deputy director for covert operations. Shackley had been thehead of the CIA station in Miami during the early 1960s, from where E. HowardHunt and his fellow Watergate burglars would emerge. Shackley went on to headthe CIA station in Saigon during the Vietnam War where he masterminded OperationPhoenix. This involved the death of tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilianswho were “suspected” of working for the Viet-Cong. (Just being able to read andwrite was enough to invite this suspicion, apparently.) Oliver North, the “star”of the Iran-Contra affair, worked with Shackley on Operation Phoenix, which isreputed to have murdered 40,000 Vietnamese villagers. Shackley ran a hugeassassination and drug operation in South-East Asia in the 1970s in which twoother Bush men, Donald Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, were involved. This operationwas threatened by President Kennedy seeking to withdraw from Vietnam, theIlluminati war that cost the lives of 50,000 Americans and two millionVietnamese. Bush appointed the same Theodore Shackley to an important positionin his CIA and Shackley would later be recruited as Bush’s speechwriter duringthe 1979–80 election campaign. The idea that someone like Shackley would behired to write Bush’s speeches defies the imagination. No doubt his other“talents” were the real reason for his presence. The last I heard, Shackley wasliving in Medellin, Columbia, home of the drug cartel. How thoroughlyappropriate. Thomas Clines, a former second in command at the CIA station inMiami, was another Bush appointee at the CIA who would be involved inIran-Contra, a scandal Bush was to say he knew nothing about.During Bush’s tenure at the CIA, the operatives knew they could do virtually asthey liked because their Director had a gift for looking the other way. Thepower over the US intelligence operations was concentrated in Bush’s hands as aresult of a series of measures introduced by President Ford, a front man for themob and an abuser of mind-controlled women (see The Biggest Secret andTrance-Formation Of America). In the words of the New York Times, Ford:“…centralized more power in the hands of the Director of Central Intelligencethan any had had since the creation of the CIA”.12 Among Bush’s CIA operativesin South America was the infamous Nazi “Butcher of Lyon”, Klaus Barbie, who hadescaped from Europe thanks to US (Illuminati) intelligence. It was he whomasterminded the so-called “cocaine-coup” in Bolivia in June 1980 and he usedthe profits from CIA-supported drug networks to finance the neo-Nazi overthrowof the government in Argentina when, according to former US Drug Enforcementagent, Mike Levine, the coup was achieved by troops wearing Nazi armbands.13Another Illuminati front operation closely connected to Bush is Sun Myung Moon’s“Moonie Church”, which is connected to many prominent politicians around theworld, including Ted Heath, the former Prime Minister of the UK from 1970 to 74(See The Biggest Secret and Children Of The Matrix). Bo Hi Pak, Moon’sright-hand man, was among the first to arrive in La Paz after the Barbie-Bush“cocaine-coup” in Bolivia. Moon, it is claimed, invested $4 million in the coupand was to massively finance Bush’s run for the presidency in 1988. TheWashington Times newspaper, so supportive of Bush, is owned by the Moonies.14The contacts George Bush made at the CIA would be invaluable when he became VicePresident to Ronald Reagan on January 21st 1981. Reagan’s personal fortune datesfrom a time shortly after becoming Governor of California when he bought someland cheaply and sold it at a vast profit to a group of benefactors who havenever been publicly identified.15 Reagan, a former B-movie actor, was along-time member of Bohemian Grove and an initiate of the Knights of Malta. Thisis another a very significant strand in the Illuminati web. Reagan was 70, theoldest man to be inaugurated as President. His mind was failing and he neededlong afternoon naps each day. Almost everything Reagan said, even in relativelyoff-the-cuff situations when greeting foreign leaders, was written for him oncue cards by his aides. George Bush was president in all, but name. After theassassination attempt on Reagan in 1981, his mind further deteriorated. Thisgave Bush almost complete control of affairs and in the background was the powerbehind the throne: his mentor, Henry Kissinger. Reagan’s would-be assassin, JohnHinckley, had connections to the Bush family. Father George built a network oforganisations within the government with himself at the head. These were theStanding Crisis, Pre-Planning Group, the Crisis Management Center, the TerroristIncident Working Group, the Task Force on Combating Terrorism and the OperationsSub-Group. These were subordinate to, and controlled by, the Special SituationGroup chaired by Bush. If ever there was a line-up of problem-reaction-solution“organisations”, then this was it. Through this network would come thearms-for-drugs operation known as Iran-Contra in which the Reagan-Bushadministration illegally sold arms to the hostile regime in Iran (hostile inpublic anyway) and used the money they received to illegally fund and arm theContra terrorists in Nicaragua who were fighting to overthrow the electedSandinista government that the Illuminati wanted removed. In return for thisvital support, the Contras supplied US government agencies controlled by GeorgeBush with drugs for distribution on the streets of America and elsewhere.Iran-contraThe now Vice President Bush hired his former CIA associate, Donald P. Gregg, ashis main adviser on “national security” and Gregg brought with him a “former”CIA assassinations manager, Felix Rodriguez, whom Bush had known back to thetime of the Bay of Pigs invasion and his period as head of the CIA. Gregg andRodriguez were involved with Theodore Shackley in the assassination anddrug-running operation in South-East Asia in the Vietnam War era. The two nowworked out of George Bush’s office! It was strictly illegal under US law for thegovernment to supply arms to Iran or to fund and arm the Nicaraguan “freedomfighters” (terrorists) called the Contras in their war with the Sandinistagovernment. It was certainly illegal to accept payment with drugs in return. TheReagan-Bush administration would do all of these things. One of the ways theBush-controlled “Reagan” government secretly undermined the Sandinistas was bymining harbours in Nicaragua. A company called Continental Shelf Associates,Inc., which is based on Jupiter Island, Florida, carried out these covertoperations. Jupiter Island is an interesting place. It became the fiefdom of theHarriman set, including George Bush, who has a home there. Jupiter Island hasbeen a base for generations of Illuminati families. Continental Shelf Associates(CSA) lists many oil companies and government agencies among its clients. Theyinclude the Rockefellers’ Exxon and the Bush-connected oil company Pennzoil. CSAwas used by the US military for coastal mapping and reconnaissance in Grenadabefore the Reagan-Bush invasion in October 1983 and during US operations in theLebanon. The company was run by Robert “Stretch” Stevens. He was a closeassociate of Theodore Shackley and Felix Rodriguez when they were all involvedin South-East Asia and the Bay of Pigs invasion. A CSA company at the sameaddress is Acta Non Verba, which means “action, not words”. A high-level CIAofficer quoted by Anton Chaitkin and Webster Griffin Tarpley, in George Bush,The Unauthorised Biography, said of this CSA subsidiary:> “Assassination operations and training company controlled by Ted Shackley,> under cover of a private corporation with a regular board of directors,> stockholders, etc, located in Florida. They covertly bring in Haitian and> South East Asian boat people as recruits, as well as Koreans, Cubans, and> Americans. They hire out assassination and intelligence services to> governments, corporations, and individuals …” 16Again, Father Bush’s close friend Shackley is involved. The bombs planted in theharbours of Nicaragua caused such a row in the US that the laws against suchaction, the Boland Laws as they were called, were further strengthened. But at asecret meeting of the National Planning Group on June 25th 1984, Bush, Reaganand their top officials decided to ignore the law. They would fund the Contrasthrough Honduras, just as they had used El Salvador against the Sandinistas.Bush and Oliver North, an official of the National Security Council, travelledtogether to El Salvador. On January 18th 1985 the Bush-appointed Felix Rodriguezis known to have met his name sake (but not thought to be a relative), RamonMilian Rodriguez, an accountant and money launderer who worked for the Medellindrug cartel. This meeting was confirmed by Felix Rodriguez and reported in theMiami Herald on June 30th 1987. From his cell in Butner, North Carolina, Ramontold investigative journalist, Martha Honey:> “ …[Felix offered] … in exchange for money for the Contra cause he would use> his influence in high places to get the [cocaine] cartel US goodwill …> Frankly, one of the selling points was that he could talk directly to Bush.> The issue of goodwill wasn’t something that was going to go through 27> bureaucratic hands. It was something that was directly between him and Bush.”> 17This could easily be done given that Felix Rodriguez was working from Bush’soffice. A memo in early September 1986 sent to Oliver North by retired ArmyMajor General John K. Singlaub, said that Rodriguez was talking of having “dailycontact” with Bush’s office and this, said the memo, could damage PresidentReagan and the Republican Party. Oliver North would also write in his notebook:“Felix has been talking too much about the VP [Vice President]”.18 In her 1987book, Out Of Control former CBS News Producer Leslie Cockburn presentsdevastating evidence of Bush’s involvement in Iran-Contra and drug running. Shesays that planes chartered by the CIA and packed with cocaine flew directly intothe Homestead Air Force Base in Florida using a CIA code signal. Colonel AlbertCarone, who was later murdered, said in a sworn statement that he rememberedseeing Oliver North make more than 20 entries in his diary detailing how drugprofits were being used to buy weapons for the Contras. He said that an entryfor July 5th 1985 noted that “$14 million to buy arms came from drugs”.19In 1986, the Reagan-Bush administration admitted that Adolfo “Popo” Chamorro’sNicaraguan Contras, the terrorists supported by the CIA, were helping aColombian drug-trafficker to transport drugs into the United States, and thetestimony of John Stockwell, a former high-ranking CIA official, revealed thatdrug smuggling was an essential component of the CIA operation with the Contras.George Morales, one of South America’s biggest traffickers, testified that hewas approached in 1984 to fly weapons to the Contras. In return, he says, theCIA helped him to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine into the United Statesvia an airstrip on the ranch of John Hull, a self-confessed CIA agent andassociate of Oliver North. As Michael Ruppert, a former drugs specialist withthe Los Angeles Police Department, said:> “The CIA and Ronald Reagan and [CIA Director] Bill Casey and Vice-President> George Bush were running the whole operation, we know that now. They> circumvented the will of Congress and there was an explosion of drug> trafficking all throughout Central America, coordinated by the CIA.” 20Meanwhile, the other aspect of Iran-Contra was continuing to illegally tradearms for hostages with Iran. Oliver North was heavily involved in the supply ofarms to Iran, via Israel, in return for hostages. The release of the hostageswas explained in part by the efforts of Terry Waite, the representative ofBritain’s Archbishop of Canterbury. Waite was being used without his knowledgeby North who was quite happy for him to take the credit for the release ofhostages when, in fact, they were the result of illegal arms sales. As aconsequence, Waite would eventually be taken hostage himself. Throughout all ofthis, George Bush was telling the American people: “We will make no concessionsto terrorists” – just as his son is saying today. Even before Reagan waselected, Bush negotiated with the Iranians to delay the release of Americanhostages until after the Presidential election of 1980 to ensure that thesitting tenant, Jimmy Carter, would not get the kudos before polling day. Sowell was this negotiated that 52 hostages flew out of Iran on the day thatReagan was inaugurated after 444 days in captivity. This became known as OctoberSurprise and no doubt the promise of arms sales to Iran by a future Reagan-Bushadministration was fundamental to the deal. I know its hard for us to imagineanyone coldly ensuring that American hostages would spend months longer incaptivity just to serve Bush’s political agenda, but that’s the mentality we aredealing with here – the same mentality that is behind September 11th and itsaftermath.In late 1986, the Iran-Contra scandal blew and Ronald Reagan had to admit some,but only some, of what was happening. He said: “A few months ago I told theAmerican people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my bestintentions still tell me that is true but the facts and evidence tell me it isnot.”(I lied.) On October 5th a plane left the Ilopango Air Base in El Salvadorwith arms and ammunition for the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua. The flight hadbeen coordinated by officials within George Bush’s office. As the plane came lowto make the drop, it was grounded by a Sandinista missile. Three people died inthe crash, but cargo handler Eugene Hasenfus parachuted into the hands of theSandinistas. Bush was alerted in a call to his office by drug-runner andassassin Felix Rodriguez. The truth was out. Or some of it was. The power of theIlluminati network can be the only explanation for how, despite the overwhelmingevidence against him, Bush evaded prosecution even though Buz Sawyer, the pilotof the crashed plane, was found to have the private phone number of GeorgeBush’s office in his pocket! Hasenfus also stated that George Bush knew aboutthe whole thing. But Bush denied any involvement or knowledge of what happened,and subordinates like Donald Regan, Admiral John Poindexter, Oliver North,Robert McFarlane, and Major General Richard Secord, were sacrificed andscapegoated. They were very much involved, of that there is no doubt, but Bushgot away with it, as did Reagan and his Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger.North, who was up to his eyes in the intrigue, faced hearings with otherscapegoats and staggeringly emerged in the eyes of many as an American hero. OnMarch 16th 1988 a Federal Grand Jury indicted North, Poindexter and others oncharges that included conspiracy to defraud the US government. A year later,despite delays due to legal manoeuvring, North was convicted of three of thetwelve criminal counts that came to court. He was fined $150,000 and was given athree-year suspended prison sentence. Poindexter, the Reagan-Bush NationalSecurity Adviser, was convicted on five counts of deceiving Congress and wasjailed for six months. But both convictions would be set aside because it wasclaimed their testimony to Congress, for which they were given immunity, wasunfairly used against them. Robert McFarlane, Poindexter’s predecessor asNational Security Adviser, admitted criminal charges of withholding informationfrom Congress about the covert support for the Contras. He was fined $20,000 andgiven two years’ probation. Others involved, like CIA Director William Casey,had “health problems”. In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra revelations, Caseyliterally could not speak following an operation for a “brain tumour” that tookaway his ability to talk. Two months later he was dead. During his presidentialelection campaign, Bush pledged to build a “kinder, gentler, America”. In July1991 Alan D. Fiers Jr, the head of CIA covert operations in Central Americabetween 1984 and 1986, admitted lying to Congress about the CIA’s involvement inthe scandal. The Tower Commission was appointed to investigate Iran-Contra andwas chaired by Bush’s friend, the Texas Senator John Tower. Also on theCommission were Brent Scowcroft, a Kissinger “yes man” and an executive of theIlluminati front, Kissinger Associates, and Ed Muskie, Ronald Reagan’s AttorneyGeneral and a close friend since his days as Governor of California. Muskie washimself implicated in Iran-Contra. As you can see, the Commission was thoroughlyindependent and, predictably, cleared Father George Bush of all blame andinvolvement. When Bush became President he made John Tower his Secretary ofDefense. Reporters asked Tower if his appointment was a pay-off from Bush. Hisresponse:> “As the Commission was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft and Ed Muskie> in addition to myself, that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent> Scowcroft and Ed Muskie … We found nothing to implicate the Vice President … I> wonder what kind of pay-off they’re going to get?” 21I can tell him. Bush appointed Brent Scowcroft as his National Security Adviser.The Senate refused to accept Tower’s appointment and he began to speak of theinjustice he believed had been done to him. He died in a plane crash on April5th 1991. When the Senate turned down Tower, a decision Bush probablyengineered, he selected Dick Cheney as Defense Secretary. Cheney was the seniorRepublican member of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert ArmsTransactions with Iran and that also cleared Bush of involvement in Iran-Contra.Bush still had a problem, however, with the former Defense Secretary CasperWeinberger, who was indicted in 1992, with others, for lying to Congress overIran-Contra. With his presidency coming to an end, this could have beendisastrous for Bush and he pardoned Weinberger and the others to ensure therewould be no trial. The pardon came on Christmas Eve 1992 in the dying days ofhis presidency after he had lost the November election to Bill Clinton and amatter of weeks before Weinberger and company were due to face a trial thatwould have implicated Bush. In January 1993 the presidency passed to Clinton whocontinued the cover-up because – as I expose in And The Truth Shall Set You Free– he was also involved, not least with the Contra drug operations at the Menaairstrip in Arkansas where he was Governor. It is actually possible tocoordinate a drug-running and arms-running operation from the White House andget away with it. Where were the media while all this was going on? Licking arseas usual. One reporter, Gary Webb on the San Jose Mercury News, did have theguts to expose how the CIA and the Bush-controlled White House had poured crackcocaine into black areas to raise money for the Contras and destroy the blackcommunities. When he did so, Webb and his newspaper were not only attacked bythe authorities, but by their fellow “journalists” and major papers like theWashington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times. How do these peoplesleep at night? Rather well, I would wager. In 1986 the United States wasconvicted by the World Court for its war crimes against Nicaragua and laterfaced condemnation for its actions against the people of Panama. The USresponse? In effect: “Piss off.” As with all playground bullies, United Statesgovernments, like those in Britain, claim immunity from that which they imposeupon others.The Gulf WarHere is another example of the mentality behind the “war on terrorism” that hasfollowed the atrocities of September 11th 2001. Today we have the Bush family inthe White House, Dick Cheney as Vice President and Colin Powell as Secretary ofState, and a United States international “coalition” goes to war in theMiddle-Near East. In 1991 the Bush family was in the White House, Cheney wasDefense Secretary and Powell was head of the US forces as Chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, and a United States international “coalition” went to war inthe Middle East. The Gulf War, if you add together the casualties from theinitial conflict in 1991 and the sanctions and bombing that have followed, hascost the lives of more than a million Iraqi children – and rising. Already thechild and civilian casualties from the “war on terrorism” are mounting as moremass murder ensues from the same source. Disputes between Iraq and Kuwait arenot new. Kuwait has been under British and Illuminati control back to the dayswhen the economic potential of oil was discovered. Iraq has one of the world’slargest oil deposits and attracts the constant attention of the US and Britishelite. In fact, countries like Kuwait, Iraq and others in the Middle East, werecreated by the British and their fellow European powers drawing lines in thesand. Kuwait is a dictatorship, an unpleasant one, and the idea that the GulfWar was to “free” Kuwait is just ridiculous. If Kuwait is to be free, thedictators of the royal family elite need to give up their power and the Britishand US manipulation of that country and its people must end. Neither is inprospect because the way things are suits the Illuminati agenda. Kuwait is abrutal dictatorship, as is (even more so) Saudi Arabia, another country FatherGeorge Bush claimed to be protecting from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein in 1991.But after the Gulf conflict what happened? Saddam was left in power in Iraq andthe Kuwaiti royal dictatorship was brought back with American and Britishsupport to continue their policy of the murder and torture of “dissidents” whocampaign for little luxuries like freedom and a say in the running of their owncountry.Saddam Hussein, the designated villain of the Gulf conflict, was in fact one ofthe gang, at least up to this point. He was a member of the elite Safari Club,which began as a consortium involving Saddam, SAVAK (the secret police of theShah of Iran), Anwar Sadat, the later-assassinated President of Egypt, and SaudiArabian Intelligence. It has been implicated in countless coups in Africa tofurther its goals and is heavily involved in arms trading and supply. Out of theSafari Club came the Pinay Circle, or Le Cercle, named after the French PrimeMinister Antoine Pinay. He was a major Illuminati asset who attended the firstofficial meeting of the elite Bilderberg Group at Oosterbeek, Holland, in May1954. Others involved with Le Cercle included the Habsburg family, a majorIlluminati bloodline. To give you an idea of its make-up and range of influence,the Le Cercle membership has included Nicholas Elliot, a department head atBritain’s MI6; William Colby, a former director of the CIA; Colonel Botta ofSwiss Military Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, a leading member of theItalian Secret Service; Giulio Andreotti, Henry Kissinger’s friend, the formerItalian Prime Minister from the notorious and terrorist P2 Freemasonry lodge,and the man who gave Mafia officials protection; Silva Munoz, a former ministerfor the fascist Franco in Spain and a member of the elite secret society withinthe Roman Catholic network, Opus Dei; Franz Josef Strauss, the German DefenceMinister; and Monsignore Brunello, an agent to the Vatican. In America, one ofthe Le Cercle fronts is alleged to be the CIA-backed Heritage Foundation inWashington. Look at the potential for such an organisation to be a coordinatingforce between apparently different agencies and countries to achieve a commonaim. Le Cercle and the Safari Club are basically the same entity, which is why,as the Wall Street Journal reported on August 16th 1990, it was the CIA thatsupported the Baath Party in Iraq and installed Saddam Hussein as dictator in1968, just as they did with Colonel Gaddafi in Libya. But it is important toremember that everyone is expendable to the cause if it best serves the agenda.Saddam Hussein was encouraged by the Americans and the British to go to war withthe CIA/British Intelligence-imposed regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran in1980. The war dragged on for eight years amid appalling suffering and loss oflife. But it was good for the oil, banking and armament cartel (all controlledby the Illuminati), and for divide and rule. The British government armed bothsides in this conflict and some (but only some) of this scandal surfaced throughthe Scott Inquiry into illegal arms sales to Iraq that reported in 1996. TheIran-Iraq War is a grotesque example of problem-reaction-solution. The CIAlooked after Khomeini during his exile in Paris to ensure he was ready andwaiting to take over when the Shah, another CIA puppet, had outlived hisusefulness. Now Saddam would be used again, knowingly or otherwise, to startanother war in the Gulf by invading Kuwait. Author and researcher George C.Andrews reported:> “A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our> Declaration of War on December 15, 1990, Secretary of State James Baker,> signed the US Army Report from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New> Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested].

Why are the huge business deals between Bush and> Hussein still off-limits to the public’s right to know?” 22To readers of my books, the answers to these questions will be obvious. The‘blind trust’, by the way, is the farce that insists that presidents must handover all their business dealings to a “trust” during their term in office. Thisis supposed to ensure they can’t make political decisions that affect their owninvestments and companies. Yeah, sounds credible. Bush’s ‘blind trust’ wascontrolled by his close friend William S. Farish III, the grandson of WilliamFarish, the President of Standard Oil New Jersey when they were working withHitler’s chemical and drug cartel I.G. Farben, which ran the slave camp atAuschwitz. While William Farish was head of Standard Oil, it was supplying theNazis through Switzerland during the war, as established by official inquiries.Today his grandson and Bush “trust manager”, William S. Farish III, is theAmerican Ambassador to the United Kingdom as Boy George Bush conducts his “waron terrorism” in conjunction with Tony Blair’s British government. WilliamFarish III is also a very close associate of Queen Elizabeth II and she keepssome of her breeding mares at his Lane’s End Farm, near Versailles in Kentucky,where she has been a regular visitor.23 (The detailed background to theinvolvement of the British royal family with the Illuminati can be found in TheBiggest Secret.)Anyway, back to the Gulf War, or Gulf Slaughter as it really was. Americanreconnaissance advised George Bush around July 16th and 17th 1990 that Iraqitroops were assembling along the border with Kuwait (or so the official storygoes). Nothing was done. On July 25th Saddam Hussein met with the US ambassadorin Baghdad, April Glaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions ofPresident Bush. She said the Bush government had “no opinion on the Arab-Arabconflict like your border disagreement with Kuwait”. Glaspie added that she hadinstructions from the President to seek better relations with Iraq. She thenleft for a summer holiday, another indication to Saddam that the Americans werenot interested in the whole thing.24 While all of this was going on, Bush stillhad nothing to say in public about the troop build-ups along the Kuwaiti border.By July 31st perhaps 100,000 troops were involved. Still Bush was silent. Twodays before the invasion, John Kelly, an assistant Secretary of State, was askedby a congressional hearing if the US would defend Kuwait in the event of anattack. He replied: “We have no defence treaty with any Gulf country.”25 OnAugust 2nd Saddam invaded Kuwait. Henry Kissinger was operating behind thescenes in the form of Brent Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser, along-time Kissinger aide back to the days of the Nixon Presidency and anexecutive of Kissinger Associates. Scowcroft was urging military interventionand the Bush tone began to change. The United States told the Saudi Arabiansthat Saddam was likely to invade their country next – utter claptrap – and Bushordered US troops to assemble along the “threatened” Saudi border. There wouldbe no intervention, the world was told. The US forces were only there to protectSaudi Arabia, Bush said, and economic sanctions were to be the weapon usedagainst Saddam. The Saudi Arabians, Germans and Japanese were pressured intocontributing large sums towards American costs.But sanctions were never going to be the real weapon and the rhetoric becameever stronger. Bush labelled Saddam “the new Hitler” and said that the SecondWorld War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. He mighthave added that it is also not the answer to fund both sides in a conflict andto help finance Hitler’s war machine, as his father had done. For those who knewthe game plan, it was easy to see what was happening. On August 23rd Kissinger’sman, Brent Scowcroft, said it all: “We believe we are creating the beginning ofa New World Order out of the collapse of the US–Soviet antagonisms.” 26 NewWorld Order is a very old code name for the Illuminati global agenda. The termwould be used by Bush in a speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 and enterinto political speak around the world to the point of tedium. He described hisNew World Order as “diverse nations drawn together in common cause”. Lose thenewspeak and this translates as world government, central bank, army andcurrency controlled by a Big Brother dictatorship – the very structure that 9/11brought so much closer. Bush received enthusiastic support for his war againstIraq from Illuminati puppets Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterand, the 33rddegree Freemason and President of France, who had supported the Nazis duringtheir occupation of his country. Both sent forces to the Gulf alongside theAmericans and the Illuminati “coalition” was presented as a United Nationsresponse. Bush said in that speech to Congress on September 11th 1990 – exactly11 years to the day before 9/11:> “Clearly no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie> concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of> nations has begun, and we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment.> The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare> opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these> troubled times, our fifth objective – a new world order – can emerge …” 27For “fifth” read “first” and, of course, this is a mirror of the rhetoric wehave had to endure since the attacks on the World Trade Center. Father Bushannounced on November 8th 1990 that the forces in Saudi Arabia would besubstantially increased. The “defensive” force was now to switch to offensivemode. A week later Bush left on a tour of Europe and the Middle East gatheringsupport for the invasion. He met for three hours with the late President Assadof Syria, another tool of the Illuminati, who pledged to increase hiscontribution to Bush’s forces to 20,000 men. The Bush “UN” forces attacked onWednesday, January 16th 1991. 120,000 air sorties were unleashed on Iraq,mostly, it turned out, against civilian areas. The operation was headed byBush’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who has ancestrallinks with many old American and British families. The number of dead andinjured from the bombing of Iraq, the resulting disease and the continuingeconomic sanctions can hardly be comprehended. Conditions for the innocentcivilians in Iraq are unimaginable under the economic stranglehold that has beenimposed since the Gulf War. This is the United Nations in all its glory. It isnot the promoter of freedom, peace, and justice, as its PR proclaims, it is anIlluminati stalking horse for global government. By the way, part of thepropaganda to gain political and public support for the invasion of Iraq was the“evidence” given to the Senate by a teenage girl that Iraqi soldiers had thrownKuwaiti babies from their incubators and sent the incubators to Baghdad. Laterit emerged that the teenager was in fact the daughter of the Kuwait Ambassadorto Washington and the whole story was a lie cooked up by public relations firmHill and Knowlton.28How Bush funded SaddamThe public were also not told that it was the Bush government that had armed andfunded the very army of Saddam Hussein that Father George had now sent US troopsto fight. Much of the funding was channelled through a branch of Italy’s BancaNazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta. Congressman Henry Gonzales exposed theBNL scandal in 1991 after he noticed that this little branch of the Italiangovernment bank had loaned Iraq $5 billion. This money was dispatched to Saddamafter November 1989 when the Bush White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraq ifthey were to be used for the purchase for US farm products. If Saddam defaulted,the US taxpayers picked up the tab for the loan and, since he was alwaysdefaulting, that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. Asplanned, Saddam spent the money on arms, including purchases from the MatrixChurchill machine tool company in England. This company was the subject of acourt case in which the British government was implicated. Although many USinvestigators warned Bush that the money was being used for arms, the loans wereallowed to continue. The aim was obvious when you look at the other evidence.Bush was doing the same as his father did with Hitler. He was funding anaggressor so he could start a war with him. Some of the money given to Saddam byBush was spent on buying poison gas from a CIA front called Cardeon Industriesin Chile.29 When the war started, Saddam defaulted on the loans and the UStaxpayers footed the bill for Iraq to fight their own sons and daughters. Thecover-up of this, as usual, led to the targeting of the small fry. The wholething was blamed on the bank manager at the BNL’s Atlanta branch, Christopher P.Drogoul, who could never have sanctioned that sort of money without the highestauthorisation. One of the network of Illuminati private “armies” is called theWackenhut Corporation and investigative journalist John Connolly exposed in aSpy Magazine article30 that Wackenhut had been involved in the arming of Iraqbefore the Gulf War by transporting the means to produce the very chemicalweapons that Father George Bush and Co were saying posed such a threat to theworld. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company with otherFBI associates in 1954 and its board has been packed over the years withrecruits from the FBI, CIA and the military. It has since merged with Group 4Falck, the world’s second largest provider of Security Services. GeorgeWackenhut is a long-time friend of Father George Bush and has contributedgenerously to his political campaigns and those of Boy George and Floridagovernor Jeb Bush. John Connolly wrote that:> “… After a six-month investigation, in the course of which we spoke to more> than 300 people, we believe we know that the [Wackenhut] truck did contain> equipment necessary for the manufacture of chemical weapons and where it was> headed [in the Winter of 1990]: to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. And the Wackenhut> Corporation – a publicly traded company with strong ties to the CIA and> federal contracts worth $200 million a year – was making sure Saddam would be> getting his equipment intact.” 31A guy called Peter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he wasinvolved at one time with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton and withIshan Barbouti International (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, the chemical andbiological weapons complex in Rabta, Libya.32 His experiences led him toinvestigate what was going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI, and operatedfor the US government under a code name because they told him these people wereinternational terrorists and that they were going to prosecute them. Kawaja saidthat he did his own investigation, however, which included “bugging telephonelines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the United States”. Hesaid he intercepted communications to the Commodity Credit Corporation and theBanca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Kawaja said he saw the letters of credit ofthe BNL, which came from Switzerland, and “a lot of other communicationsregarding the Gulf War that was to come.” He said he recorded calls going to andcoming from Baghdad, to and from the United States and London, CIA, FBI, FBIcounter-intelligence, US Customs, certain politicians, and numerous otherindividuals. “This is my information,” he said in the radio interview. “It isnot second-hand.” US District Judge Marvin Shoob said the claim that the Atlantabranch of the BNL could loan $5 billion to Iraq without the approval of the headoffice in Rome could only come out of “never-never land”. The judge said thatmanager Drogoul and four other employees at the branch:> “… were pawns or bit players in a far larger and wider ranging sophisticated> conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American and foreign> corporations and the governments of the United States, England, Italy and Iraq> … smoke is coming out of every window. I have to conclude that the building is> on fire.” 33This is the last thing the Father Bush administration and the Illuminati wantedto hear. Judge Shoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge ErnestTidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA and theBush-White House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded to plead guiltyeven though he wasn’t. The funding of the Iraqi arms build-up before the GulfWar involved the Bush administration, the British government, the Italiangovernment, the Soviet Union and other leading governments controlled by theIlluminati. It also involved another familiar name, Henry Kissinger. As early as1984 his company Kissinger Associates was arranging for loans from the BNL toIraq to finance its arms purchases from a little-known subsidiary of Fiat, whichwas headed by major Illuminati initiate Giovanni Agnelli. Charles Barletta, aformer Justice Department investigator, was quoted about this in the USSpotlight newspaper on November 9th 1992. The report said:> “Barletta added that Federal probers had collected dozens of such> incriminating case histories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger> seems to possess a kind of immunity. I’m not sure how he does it, but> Kissinger wields as much power over the Washington National Security> bureaucracy now as in the days when he was the Nixon administration’s foreign> policy czar. He gets the pay-off; others get the blame. Kissinger will remain> unscathed until Congress finds the courage to convene a full-dress> investigation into this Teflon power broker.”Home of the brave …It is appropriate to focus on the Gulf War before we proceed to 9/11 and the“war on terrorism”, for these are mirrors of each other. Same people, sameagenda, same methods, same mass slaughter of the innocent. Firstly, as withAfghanistan, the Gulf War wasn’t exactly a war. My understanding of a “war” isthat you need two sides, and under that definition, the Gulf War was not a“war”. It was the military equivalent of putting Mike Tyson in the ring withyour granny. American soldiers have described this “war” as a “turkey shoot”,which is precisely what it was. The Iraqi army, mainly conscripts who had nochoice, may have been armed by the US and Britain, but it was still like tryingto stop an elephant with a pop gun. Iraqi men, women and children were subjectedto the most intense bombing blitz in human history. Hundreds of thousands diedin the bombardment and while the media were showing us pictures provided by theUS military of “smart bombs” that could target a building and go through atoilet window, the truth that was being suppressed daily by the military censorswas very different. At least 93% of the bombs that rained from the Iraqi skieswere not “smart” and that’s according to the Pentagon’s own numbers, and 70% ofthem missed their target. Wade Frazier’s excellent study of the Gulf “War”reveals the background to just one of the devices used against the Iraqi people:> “The [fuel-air] bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads> a fine mist of fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a> football field] into an explosive mix of vast proportion; then a second> detonation ignites the mixture, causing an awesome explosion. The explosion is> about the most powerful ‘conventional’ explosion we know of.> “At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in its> detonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around> them. Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The> bomb sucks oxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out> through the mouths of people unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone.> Our military used it on helpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].” 34These were the same weapons used in Afghanistan. The Iraqi people, living,breathing, human beings like you and me, were also subjected to a lovely pieceof hardware called a “Big Blue”, which produces a shock wave only eclipsed bynuclear weapons. As Wade Frazier points out, the power of the shock wave canturn a body into a hamburger. So-called “bouncing bombs” were also deployed.These are designed to “bounce” to waist height before exploding and ensure abetter chance of splattering people into a thousand pieces. These are called“anti-personnel” weapons in the sanitised “newspeak” of the Illuminati frontmen. Then there was (and is) the “Beehive”, which explodes 8,800 pieces ofrazor-edged shrapnel in all directions, cutting through a human body like theproverbial knife through butter. All these weapons were used against civilianmen, women and children in the Gulf “War” and all the others since, includingthe “war on terrorism”. In an oh so rare excursion into reality by the media,John Balzar of the Los Angeles Times reported in 1991 on the fate of Iraqiconscripts. He saw night-vision “gun sight” footage from the briefing room:> “They looked like ghostly sheep flushed from a pen – Iraqi infantrymen> bewildered and terrified, jarred from sleep and fleeing their bunkers under a> hellish fire. One by one, they were cut down by attackers they could not see> or understand. Some were blown to bits by bursts of 30-millimeter exploding> cannon shells. One man dropped, writhed on the ground, then struggled to his> feet; another burst of fire tore him apart … Even hardened soldiers hold their> breath as the Iraqi soldiers, as big as football players on the television> screen, run with nowhere to hide. These are not bridges exploding or airplane> hangers. These are men.”The same reporter wrote:> “The mechanics of death and destruction are a grim affair. The military’s> scientific approach and its philosophies – for example, its preference for> wounding vital organs over blowing off limbs – can be deeply disquieting to> anybody who imagines such matters are left to chance. Many people would rather> not know about the gruesome details”.35“Nuke ’em, kill ’em all”This was not a war, it was a mass slaughter by the very forces and controllerswho are now waging a “war on terrorism” against anyone they choose to demonisethrough their pathetic media. These protectors of “freedom” and “liberty” usedthe same rhetoric then as they do now to justify the mass bombing of civilians.They hide this truth because of the lies so eagerly repeated by journalists whoinsult our intelligence and a public that has long forgotten, not only what tothink, but even how to. Then, as now, no dissent was allowed against thegenocide of the innocent by the criminally insane. Talk show hosts, without twobrain cells acting in unison, called for nuclear attacks on Iraq and anyone whochallenged the “war” was either stupid or a supporter of evil. While the sheeplefollowed the fox, or Fox, the US government and their British allies weretargeting civilian bomb shelters, killing hundreds of fathers, mothers andchildren because “Intelligence told us that the bomb shelter was actually amilitary headquarters”. Bullshit. These are the same idiots (or coldlycalculated killers more like) who bombed a town in Afghanistan a week after theTaliban had left! What people need to realise is that US surveillance satellitescan read your car number plate from space; and look at how the Airman magazinedescribed the capabilities of the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance planedeployed in Afghanistan:> “On an early test, for example, Global Hawk flew at 56,000 feet over the Naval> Weapons Center at China Lake, California. The images it gathered were so clear> that an electro-optical image stands out next to an F/A-18 fighter. An> infrared image showed where concrete had cooled down from the shadow of a> C-130 that had recently taken off.” 36So there are no “mistakes” about who or what is located in a bomb shelter. It iscold-blooded murder. For the same reason there are no “mistakes” in the failure,at least officially, to establish the location of Osama bin Laden during theinvasion of Afghanistan. Reporter Peter Arnett of CNN visited the civilian bombshelter in Iraq and found it was … a bomb shelter. He also visited a milkfactory bombed because it was a “chemical weapons factory” and found it was … amilk factory. In fact he had been there a year before and it was producing …milk.The Highway of DeathOn the ground thousands of Iraqi soldiers were buried alive as “UN” forces usedbulldozers to fill in their trenches in fundamental contravention ofinternational law. But nothing sums up the mentality of these deeply sick peoplecurrently waging the “war on terrorism” better than the almost unimaginableattacks on the “Highway of Death”. The Iraqi army was in retreat in the wake ofthe air bombardment and headed out of Kuwait across the border to Basra. Withthem were civilians and prisoners. US pilots attacked the vehicles at the frontand back of the seven-mile retreating human convoy, so forcing it to astandstill on the open road. They then systematically bombed the convoy,constantly racing back to their aircraft carrier to re-arm and return tocontinue the mass murder. As one pilot said, it was like “shooting fish in abarrel” and thousands died at the hands of the very people who now “fightterrorism” and promote themselves as morally superior to those they target.Barry McCaffrey, one of the generals involved in this mass murder, was laterappointed by President Clinton to head his “war on drugs”. Yet, as he conductedthese crimes against humanity, Father George Bush’s approval ratings soared,just as they did for his son when he continued the long, long, familyassociation with human genocide. The blatant defiance of the Geneva Conventionon the Highway of Death produced no action against the Bush administrationbecause there is one law for America, Britain, France and Germany, etc., and avery different one for those they choose to bomb, kill, and mutilate. AnInternational War Crimes Tribunal found President George Bush, Vice PresidentDan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker, andmilitary leaders Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, guilty of war crimes. Butwhat was done as a result? Nothing. These are the people who have the audacityto put others on trial for war crimes, like the former Serbian leader SlobodanMilosevic.Dark knightsThe Illuminati Queen of England was most grateful to these genocidal maniacs,however, and she made Bush’s military chiefs Colin Powell and “Stormin’” NormanSchwarzkopf, (the commander of Operation Desert Storm) Honorary Knights of theBritish Empire. Schwarzkopf has lied through his teeth about the “mystery”disease known as Gulf War Syndrome that has afflicted veterans of thatslaughter. His father would have been proud of him. Norman Schwarzkopf seniorhad been an important player in the British-American Intelligence coup calledOperation AJAX, which removed the Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadeghin 1953. The Illuminati wanted him ousted after he nationalised oil productionand removed the oil cartel’s power over his people. The British bloodline PrimeMinister Winston Churchill was also behind the coup and Mossadegh was replacedby the dictatorship of the Shah of Iran who reversed the oil nationalisation(see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). It is rare for the Queen to giveHonorary Knighthoods and other honours to people outside the Commonwealth, butthose she has chosen read like an Illuminati Who’s Who. The titles are dubbed“honorary” because the American Constitution forbids the acceptance of titlesfrom the monarch of a foreign state without the permission of Congress. So fewof these honours are given because, as a British government official put it:“One must not debase the currency.” I wonder if you think the following namesdebase the currency: George Bush, the paedophile, child killer, mass murderer,Satanist and close friend of the Windsors, was made an Honorary Knight GrandCross of the Order of the Bath, as was Ronald Reagan, Bush’s lapdog “President”;Henry Kissinger, the orchestrator of genocide on a monumental scale worldwide,was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George at a ceremonyat Windsor Castle; Brent Scowcroft, an executive of Kissinger Associates and topadviser to George Bush, was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire; andCasper Weinberger, another Bush clone who was charged with offences in theIran-Contra arms scandal and pardoned by Bush, is another Honorary Knight of theBritish Empire. After the September 11th atrocities, the insider mayor of NewYork, Rudolph Giuliani, was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the MostExcellent Order of the British Empire for doing nothing more than the job he waspaid handsomely to do. So why was he such a chosen one? For some more realisticbackground to “hero” Giuliani and his activities see the website of RobertLederman, a street artist in New York and a regular columnist for the GreenwichVillage Gazette.37Burying the truthThe crimes for which the Bush family and their masters and associates areresponsible rarely come to light because the media, at the top level, iscontrolled by the Illuminati and most journalists either don’t realise they arepawns in a game or they accept it to protect their careers. The accounts arelegion of how evidence and footage that expose the lies, especially in wartime,are banned or confiscated. One example during the 1991 Gulf Slaughter was whenthe American TV networks NBC and CBS refused to air pictures shot in Iraq of thedestruction of civilian areas that revealed the Bush government and militaryaccounts to be a grotesque fiction – just as they are in the “war on terrorism”.The story was blocked by the President of NBC Michael Gartner and the producersoffered it to CBS, where Tom Bettag, the Executive Editor of the CBS EveningNews, said one of them would appear on the show the following day to tell theirstory. That evening Bettag was sacked and the story buried. This is the realbackground to the TV news.38 Footage of the Highway of Death was also suppressedand, as in the “war on terrorism”, US casualties caused by the enemy wereclaimed to be “training accidents”. Bush’s lies about Iraqi troop deployments inKuwait, provable by satellite images, were also never shown. This satellite“loophole in the lies” was the reason why the US government purchased all rightsto satellite pictures of Afghanistan while that country was subjected to anotherinsane American and British bombing onslaught. We should note, of course, thathaving said that the CIA-installed dictator Saddam Hussein was a threat to theworld, and with the Iraqi “army” destroyed, Father George Bush suddenly calledan end to the “war” and pulled the troops out leaving Saddam still intact. AsNorman Schwarzkopf said with an air of disappointment: “We could have completelyclosed the door and made it a battle of annihilation … [it was] literally aboutto become the battle of Cannae, a battle of annihilation.” Ah, never mindNorman, but you see your President and those who controlled him wanted Husseinto stay put, or at least appear to, so they could play that card over and over.I suspect, however, that the Saddam story is going to lead to some kind ofclimax eventually.Look at this America …The public believe the Gulf War ended in 1991, but in fact it was onlybeginning. Using the “threat” of Saddam, the “threat” Bush chose not to removewhen it was there for the taking, the United States and the UK, the diabolicalduo of world terrorism, have led a campaign of “sanctions” against Iraq. Theyhave also continued, unreported, the bombing of civilian targets, a policymaintained by the Clinton and Boy George Bush administrations. Investigativejournalist John Pilger wrote of a woman he met in northern Iraq who had lost herhusband, children and father-in-law when they were bombed by two US planes whiletending their sheep on open land.39 The sanctions against a country that imports70% of its food have been imposed on a people already devastated by the massbombing of their electricity, water supply, transport and sewer systems, whichthe British and American governments have refused to allow them to rebuild. Apublic health team from Harvard University went into Iraq soon after theofficial bombing and estimated that over 46,000 children under the age of fivehad already died by August 1991 because of the destruction of Iraq’sinfrastructure.40 But the nightmare was only beginning. Writer Thomas J. Nagyexposed the coldly calculated way the US military targeted the Iraqi watersupply in the full knowledge of the gruesome affect this would have on thepeople, especially children. In an article headed “The Secret Behind theSanctions: How the US Intentionally Destroyed Iraq’s Water Supply”, he wrotethat “the United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis, mostly children,would pay, and it went ahead anyway.” 41 Nagy, who lectures at the School ofBusiness and Public Management at George Washington University, uncovereddocuments from the US Defense Intelligence Agency that reveal a stunningdisregard for human life. A document dated January 22nd 1991 says:> “Iraq depends on importing specialized equipment and some chemicals to purify> its water supply … Failing to secure supplies will result in a shortage of> pure drinking water for much of the population. This could lead to increased> incidences, if not epidemics, of disease.” They add that the “most likely> diseases during [the] next 60-90 days [include]: diarrhoeal diseases> (particularly children); acute respiratory illnesses (colds and influenza);> typhoid; hepatitis A (particularly children); measles, diphtheria, and> pertussis (particularly children); meningitis, including meningococcal> (particularly children); cholera (possible, but less likely).” 42This is a fundamental violation of the Geneva Convention which says:> “It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects> indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs,> crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation> works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to> the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive.”The US/British-led sanctions against Iraq do all of these things.By 1995 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was forced to admit on the USSixty Minutes television programme that these sanctions had already cost thelives of half a million Iraqi children and that was only up to then. The figureis currently running at some 5,000 dead children a month and passing a millionin total, while the perpetrators lead a “war on terrorism”! Albright said onSixty Minutes that she thought the consequences for those children were worth itto stop Saddam. This is the mentality that controls our world. A report byRichard Garfield of Columbia University concluded that the increase in childdeath rates in Iraq was virtually unique in modern health studies.43 Conditionslike kwashiorkor and marasmus, the result of starvation, are now common. We aretold of the horrific treatment of women by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan,but not of the same treatment by Saudi Arabia, a brutal, fascist regime, whichis on the side of the “good guys” in the “war against sanity”; and we are toldnothing about the plight of women in Iraq in the face of the US and British-ledsanctions. Some 70% of Iraqi women are now anaemic. Denis Halliday, thecoordinator of the so-called “oil-for-food” programme, resigned in September1998 and spoke out against the genocidal affects of the sanctions. Hissuccessor, Hans von Sponeck, did the same in February 2000. The US governmentresponse was to try to discredit the two men. The “oil for food” farce providesthe oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil; 40% of Iraqi’s oil, exchanged to buy food,ends up in the United States at knock-down prices because of the sanctionsimposed by the United States and supported by the Illuminati front, the UnitedNations.The sanctions are “justified” in part because of the “weapons of massdestruction”, including biological weapons, claimed to be stockpiled by SaddamHussein. Well, first, the Iraqi arsenal, whatever it may be, was funded by theUS and British governments and their allies. Second, the biggest owner ofweapons of mass destruction on the planet is the American government and by farthe greatest user of them is … the US government. Only one government hasdropped nuclear weapons on another country at the time of writing … the USgovernment. British leaders, too, have an appalling record of genocide and asfar back as 1919, when Winston Churchill was Secretary of State at the WarOffice, they were using chemical weapons against Iraq. Churchill said this aboutthe use of poison gas to put down an Iraqi rebellion against colonial rule: “Ido not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. I am strongly infavour of using [it] against uncivilised tribes.” 44 When Saddam Hussein offeredin 1990 to destroy such weapons in Iraq if Israel did the same with theirs, theUnited States government said it was not willing to negotiate on that subject –not least because to acknowledge that Israel has a massive nuclear capabilitywould make illegal the billions of dollars of US aid to that country everyyear.45 They all know of Israel’s nuclear stockpile, but if no one officiallyadmits it exists they can go on with business as usual. As the former UnitedNations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: “It would be some timebefore I fully realised that the United States sees little need for diplomacy.Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy … The Roman Empire had no needfor diplomacy. Nor does the United States.” 46 It appears to see no need to tellthe truth, either. In early 1999, it was revealed that the Iraqis’ claims aboutUnited Nations weapon inspections in their country was correct. The UNSCOMinspections were being used for spying by the United States. The Washington Postof March 2nd quoted US officials who described how members of the UNSCOM teamhad been planting spying devices for the United States during their “independentinspections”. Scott Ritter, one of the weapons inspectors in Iraq, made it clearthat the United States and British governments were lying about the dangersposed by Iraq – the very “dangers” they have used to justify their onslaughtagainst Iraqi civilians, especially children. Ritter said in the June 2000edition of Arms Control Today:> “Given the comprehensive nature of the monitoring regime put in place by> UNSCOM, which included a strict export-import control regime, it was possible> as early as 1997 to determine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had> been disarmed. Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities of chemical> or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrial means to> produce these agents had either been eliminated or were subject to stringent> monitoring. The same was true of Iraq’s nuclear and ballistic missile> capabilities.> “ … By the end of 1998, Iraq had, in fact, been disarmed to a level> unprecedented in modern history, but UNSCOM and the Security Council were> unable – and in some instances unwilling – to acknowledge this> accomplishment.”Why? Because it would have destroyed the cover story necessary to continue thegenocide. Add to that the voting record of the United States at the UnitedNations where it has consistently opposed resolutions to limit the productionand testing of biological and nuclear weapons, as it has on a stream ofhumanitarian and freedom issues. Robert Cooper, a former diplomat and personalassistant for foreign affairs to British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, admitted inThe Post-Modern State and the World Order: “We need to get used to the idea ofdouble standards … [in other words] … get over it, we are hypocrites (butpowerful ones).” Cooper said that the conflict with Iraq was to maintain controlof oil supplies and that “ … The reasons for fighting the Gulf War were not thatIraq had violated the norms of international behaviour …”. Exactly. They justuse any excuse to sell a lie to the people to advance their agenda – as theyhave with September 11th. When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons on theKurdish people, the United States and Britain didn’t say a word because he was aUS ally at the time, fighting the Iraq-Iran war in which the US and Britain werearming both sides. The forces of freedom and liberty have also been bombing Iraqwith radioactive weapons and this has led to the birth of babies with horribledeformities and disease (see my website). Since this bombardment began, Iraq hasdeveloped the world’s highest rate of childhood leukaemia. At the same timethere has been an embargo on medicines and technology that would help to reducethe radiation. The genocidal attacks on the Iraqi population began with“Republican” George Bush, continued with “Democrat” Bill Clinton, and within amonth of taking office at the start of 2001, George W. Bush, another“Republican”, was ordering (being told to order) more “routine” bombing of Iraq.In truth they are just lackeys for the same one-party state and that’s why thepolicies never change no matter who is in the White House.The bank of crooks and criminals (BCCI)The funding and manipulation of the Gulf War connects with another scandal, thatof the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. This had close links with theItalian BNL, the bank used by the United States to bankroll Saddam Hussein. Abrief summary of the BCCI debacle is necessary because of the people involvedand the connections from the BCCI through to current events. The BCCI was formedin the early 1970s and expanded rapidly to boast 400 branches in 78 countries.Its name is remarkably similar to the Banque De Credit International (BCI) ofthe Mossad agent Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, which was used by the British-AmericanIntelligence network involved in the assassination of President Kennedy (see AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free). Its “successor”, the BCCI, was a major player inthe drug money-laundering network and was used for this purpose by Illuminatielements within the CIA, British Intelligence and Mossad. Money to fund covertoperations, terrorists groups like those of Osama bin Laden and Abu Nidal, coupsand assassinations throughout the world, and the financing of Iran-Contra andSaddam Hussein, was also channelled through the BCCI. Former US Green BeretAlbert Carone claimed he was a representative of the BCCI while working oncovert operations. He said the bank was founded by the US intelligence communityto finance covert operations worldwide without the approval of Congress.47 Inother words, to finance the Illuminati agenda. Money could be transferredbetween apparent enemies through this network, as with Saudi Arabian money,which found its way to Mossad. In this case, Saudi and other Gulf money waslaundered through the BCCI and transferred to CenTrust in Miami, which was laterseized by Federal investigators. The BCCI owned 28% of CenTrust. Allegationsemerged that Robert Gates, the man Bush nominated as his Director of the CIA,had obstructed an investigation into drug money laundering by the BCCI. Gateswithdrew his nomination to be CIA Director, as he had once before whenimplicated in Iran-Contra. The BCCI crashed amid a worldwide scandal in 1991. Itwas the world’s biggest banking collapse and cost investors billions of dollars.Three years before the crash, Robert Gates was describing the BCCI as the Bankof Crooks and Criminals. The BCCI began to operate in Pakistan in 1972 with mostof its funding provided by the Bank of America and the CIA. Bank of America alsoloaned money to people to buy stock in BCCI, probably to hide the scale of itscontrol, and the B of A knew all about money laundering. In 1986, it was fined$7 million for 17,000 acts of washing dirty money. Some researchers say that theRothschilds control the Bank of America. At the hub of the Rothschildinvolvement in the BCCI was Doctor Alfred Hartmann who, at the same time, wasthe managing director of the Swiss branch of the BCCI; the head of the ZurichRothschild bank, AG; a board member of N.M. Rothschild in London; and a directorof … Italy’s BNL, the bank through which the Bush government covertly fundedSaddam Hussein. The involvement of the Rothschilds at the heart of the BCCI wasnever mentioned or investigated by the media, nor was the alleged involvement ofthe financier and currency speculator, George Soros, of the IlluminatiBilderberg Group.Here a Bush, there a Bush, everywhere a Bush, BushFather George Bush and his successor Bill Clinton both had considerableconnections with the BCCI. Among them was Jackson Stephens. He is the owner ofStephens Incorporated, a big investment bank based in Little Rock, Arkansas, thehome of Bill Clinton. Stephens was one of the founders of the BCCI. He hadconnections with a company called Harken Energy and arranged a loan for themfrom a Swiss bank affiliated with the BCCI. This would have greatly pleasedGeorge W. Bush, the then President’s son, who sat on the Harken board and had afortune invested in the company. Another investor in Harken Energy, it emergedafter September 11th, was Khalid bin Mahfouz, the operations director of theBCCI and 20% shareholder who was later named by the United States government asa financial supporter of Osama bin Laden. What a coincidence. Jeb Bush, BoyGeorge’s brother and now Governor of Florida, also had numerous dealings withthe BCCI. He was often seen in the bank’s Miami office and Father George’sdeputy campaign manager, James Lake, worked for a major owner of the BCCI at thetime. When Bill Clinton, Father Bush’s “opponent”, ran for president, his mainfinancial backer was the same Jackson Stephens who made the donations via hisWorthen National Bank, which was connected to the BCCI. Stephens was implicatedin deals in which the BCCI secretly and illegally took over the First AmericanBank of Washington and others. This was the man who funded the Bushes and theClintons.Father George’s involvement with the BCCI was considerable, according to theChicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. Hehas claimed publicly, including an interview on Radio Free America, that Bush,Saddam Hussein, and others, used the BCCI to split $250 billion in oil “kickbacks”, the skimming-off of money paid by western oil companies in the Gulf.Other researchers and insiders have said the same. Skolnick claims that therecords implicating Bush in deals with Saddam and former Panama President ManuelNoriega were in the hands of the Bank of England and that the money waschannelled through the BCCI and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) branches in theUSA. Henry Gonzales, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, identifiedlinks between the BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer Tom Valentine on RadioFree America:> “[The BCCI] … was formed in the 1970s with seed money from the Bank of> America, the largest shareholders of which are the Rothschilds of Chicago,> Paris, London, and Switzerland … The bank is also linked to the financial> affairs of former President Jimmy Carter and his friend, and one-time budget> director, banker Bert Lance.> “Some of the … Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have been> published, for example, in the May 3rd issue of the Wall Street Journal.> During the 1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major> financiers of the Michael Dukakis campaign … BCCI financed the Democratic> Party in the United States and arranged deals for Republicans outside the> United States.” 48Jimmy Carter personally dedicated a number of BCCI branches and they made an$8.5 million donation to one of his favourite charities. Carter’s foreign travelafter he left the White House was paid for by the BCCI and his banker friendBert Lance was bailed out of big financial difficulties by Gaith Pharaon, afront man for the BCCI. Andrew Young, Carter’s former United Nations ambassador,and a fellow member of the Illuminati’s Trilateral Commission, had a loan of$160,000 written off by the BCCI and was paid to promote the bank to individualsand governments in Africa and Central America. Orrin Hatch, the RepublicanSenator for Utah, was making stirring speeches in support of the BCCI even whileit was being indicted for drug money laundering. This is the same Orrin Hatchwho told CNN immediately after the planes struck the World Trade Center thatofficials believed that Osama bin Laden could be responsible.49 The DemocratClark Clifford and his law partner Robert Altman, the BCCI’s lawyers, were atthe centre of the story, also. Pricewaterhouse, the BCCI’s auditors for nearly20 years, were giving the bank a largely clean bill of health while all thecorruption was going on. Skolnick said records detailing the alleged Bush-Saddamdeals were held in the Chicago branch of the BCCI, which was seized by theFederal government in 1988. Skolnick went on:> “The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between General> Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, and George Bush. In January of> 1990, the Federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida’s> branch on trial. They were allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the> wrist and a small penalty. Here’s why: they told the Justice Department that> if they were going to prison, they had documents from their bank showing that> George Bush had private business ventures through their bank with a series of> dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well …> “… Saddam’s oil was shipped to Texas. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of> Pennzoil, issued the largest damages verdict in American history against> Texaco. Pennzoil claimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil.> Who owns Pennzoil? George Bush and his friends … as a result Texaco fell under> the domination and supervision of Pennzoil. Where did the kickbacks to Saddam> reportedly come from? They came from deals between Texaco and its subsidiaries> purchasing oil from Iraq.” 50You can leave your lid on …If you placed end to end all the questions that Father George Bush needs toanswer, but won’t, they would stretch from Washington to Baghdad. An officialinvestigation was ordered to investigate the BCCI scandal and was chaired byDemocrat Senator, John Kerry, of Massachusetts. It exposed nothing. SenatorKerry was chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee that receivedlarge contributions from the BCCI and he is also a member of the Skull and BonesSociety. The corruption across American politics, media, banking, business andthe military is simply staggering, and so it is in the United Kingdom wing ofthe Illuminati, where the BCCI had its main base. The British Prime Minister atthe time of the cover-up was John Major who is now a business associate ofFather George Bush, who was US President at the time. The British “inquiry”report on the bank by Lord Justice Bingham decided that the collapse was due to“a tragedy of errors, misunderstandings, and failures of communication”. Forgoodness sake, it was one of the biggest drug money, terrorist-funding, andillegal arms money laundering operations the world has yet seen. It implicatedsome of the biggest names in global politics, banking and business, and financedterrorists, drug cartels and covert operations by British Intelligence, the CIAand others of that ilk. The Bank of England completed the cover-up through anarrangement with Abu Dhabi, the bank’s principal owners at the time of thecollapse. This agreement allowed important records and witnesses to leaveBritain. How convenient. In his review of Dirty Money, a book about the BCCI,the journalist Robert Sherrill said:> “Dirty Money clearly leaves the impression that many officials are less than> enthusiastic about digging deeper into the scandal. Could it be because of> that rumoured list of 100 politicians that the BCCI paid off? Or because ‘key> investigators’ have indicated that if they continued their probe it might take> them ‘into the highest levels of political power around the world’ in ways> that would dwarf even the wildest conspiracy theory. Whoa! That would never> do.” 51The invasion of PanamaReaders new to this information will no doubt be extremely surprised to see thenames of Saddam Hussein and General Manuel Noriega so closely connected toFather George Bush. After all, didn’t he invade both of their countries on thepretext of removing their “terrorist” regimes? Ah, but that’s the movie versionfor public consumption. The real story, as always, is very different – just asit is with September 11th. The Bush attack on Panama on December 20th 1989 wasabout drugs, although not in the way it was portrayed by the government and themedia. This is another fine example of how the truth of the situation issubmerged in political rhetoric and media camouflage. We are told that Americantroops invaded Panama and abducted President Manuel Noriega because of hisdrug-running activities and to save American children from the evil of drugs. Infact, the opposite was the case. Noriega was on the payroll of the CIA whileBush was its Director and he was being paid some $110,000 a year for his“services”, which included running drugs. When Bush was challenged about thisafter the invasion of Panama, he said he had never met Noriega, but thensuddenly remembered the meeting. Noriega was involved in drug trafficking andrigged elections, but the Bush government and the CIA knew that when theyemployed him. William Tyree, a former member of the elite US Green Beretregiment, said in testimony for a law-suit against George Bush and the CIA filedin 1998 that he flew more than 100 plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to theAlbrook Air Station in Panama between December 1975 and March 1976 as part of“Operation Watchtower”. Looking on as the cocaine was unloaded, he said, wereCIA officers, an Israeli colonel and Manuel Noriega. Tyree filed the suit in aneffort to prove his innocence after being jailed for the murder of his wife,Elaine. She kept a diary of her husband’s drug-running activities for the CIAand George Bush, and when Tyree began to speak out about his experiences hiswife was murdered, the diary stolen, and he was framed for the killing in 1979.Tyree alleged in the suit that Father George Bush ordered the theft anddestruction of his wife’s diary. Another Green Beret, Colonel Albert Carone,described how he worked with Oliver North in drug trafficking duringIran-Contra. Carone was murdered in 1990 and five other Special Forces colonelsalso involved have died in mysterious circumstances. Carone’s testimony wasamong the documents presented by Tyree in the lawsuit, which, of course, wascovered up.52Arnulfo Arias won the 1984 Panama election, but Noriega took power with amixture of extreme violence and fraud. The US Secretary of State George Shultz,a major Illuminati operator, was dispatched to give legitimacy to Noriega andeven to declare that Panama’s democratic principles were a lesson to theSandinista government in Nicaragua! According to Noriega, his relationship withBush began to change during the Iran-Contra period when Admiral John Poindexter,the head of the National Security Council, visited him on December 17th 1985.Poindexter was prosecuted for his part in Iran-Contra. Noriega told CBS reporterMike Wallace that Poindexter demanded that he support the illegal US war againstthe Sandinista government in Nicaragua. When he refused, Poindexter threatenedeconomic warfare and the destabilisation of Panama. What Poindexter wanted wasfor Panama to invade Nicaragua with American support, Noriega said.53 At nopoint was Noriega’s alleged involvement in drugs mentioned. But the US DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA) did contact him about drugs. They wrote tocongratulate him on helping them to stop Panama being used as a drug and drugmoney-laundering centre! Just one month later, the Reagan-Bush administrationdemanded that Noriega be removed on the grounds of drugs, corruption, and lackof democracy. This from a government that, through agencies like the CIA, hassupported and imposed some of the most grotesque dictatorships across the worldto suit its own agenda, including the financing of terrorists to murder womanand children by the thousand. The same government that said Panamanian democracywas a lesson to Nicaragua. It is not easy to establish the motivation of DrugEnforcement Administration agents because among them are both people committedto stopping the flow of drugs into America and others equally determined toincrease it. A number of DEA and CIA operatives have described how someofficials of the Drug Enforcement Administration are involved in expanding theavailability of hard drugs on the streets of the United States. Noriega’s formerchief adviser, José Blandon, has claimed that the DEA has protected the biggestplayers in the drug empires and that DEA officials paid Noriega $4.7 million tokeep quiet. Dennis Dale, who headed a DEA operation in Central America, said intestimony that “… the major targets of my investigations almost invariablyturned out to be working for the CIA”.54 In February 1988, Noriega was indictedon drugs charges and all but one were related to activities before 1984 when hewas on the CIA payroll. Economic sanctions against Panama followed – theeconomic warfare that Poindexter had promised. If Noriega had agreed to supportthe US with Nicaragua, or hadn’t fallen out with Bush, he would still bedictator of Panama instead of sitting in a US jail.When Bush officially became President in 1989, he made the ludicrous statementthat Panama posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US National Securityand foreign policy. US News and World Report said on May 1st 1989 that Bush hadauthorised $10 million in CIA expenditure on projects against the Panamagovernment. Some of the money was delivered by the CIA’s Carlos Eleta Almaran,who had recently been arrested for drug trafficking. Bush ordered those chargesto be dropped after Noriega was ousted. By December 20th 1989, with Noriegastill there despite the CIA’s best efforts, United States forces invaded Panama.Thousands of civilians, including children, were killed. This was covered up bythe Bush administration, but I have seen video footage of the devastation incivilian areas caused by the US attacks – areas that housed some of the poorestpeople in the country. The lives of the poor had already been devastated by USeconomic warfare. Noriega was abducted to America for trial and jailed on drugscharges. The rest of the “free world”, including Britain’s Margaret Thatcher,offered not a word of protest. The judge at his trial refused to allow any CIAdocuments to be seen in his defence and he was sentenced to 40 years’imprisonment. What, therefore, should Bush and other government and CIAofficials receive if they ever came to trial? They would have to reincarnatemany times to complete the sentence. One of the key prosecution witnesses in the“trial” of Noriega was Carlos Lehder. He is a co-founder of the Medellin drugcartel in Colombia and a business partner of the Bush family, who arefundamentally involved in the Medellin operation.55 Lehder, real name CarlosEnrique Lehder Rivas, was extradited to the US on drugs charges and gaveevidence against Noriega while saying nothing about the Bush connection. He wasgiven a much-reduced sentence for his own drug convictions and then apparently“disappeared” from the US prison system.56 The “leaders” the Bush regime imposedon the people of Panama to replace Noriega were fundamentally connected with themoney-laundering and drug-trafficking business. The new President, GuillermoEndara, was on official of at least six banks involved in drug money-laundering.The money laundered through these sources came from the Colombian drug-smugglingring led by Augusto Falcon and Salvador Magluta, who were reported to besmuggling one ton of cocaine a month into Florida from the late 1970s until1987.57 The new Vice President in Panama installed by Bush was Ricardo AriasCalderon whose brother was president of the First Interamericas Bank when it wascontrolled by the Cali drug cartel. Official figures show that drug traffickingand money laundering in Panama after Noriega was ousted was greater than it hadbeen when he was there. The invasion and US (Illuminati) puppet regimes thathave followed also ensured that the United States would retain control of thePanama Canal zone that was officially handed back to Panama in 1999.The truth of what really happened in Panama was suppressed – as it was inAfghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia ad infinitum – by the government and militarycontrol of the media. What happened in Panama happens everywhere these disturbedpeople take their murder machine. The media were not allowed to go anywhere thatdid not suit the official story and they were presented with “news” conferencesin which US officials told the reporters whatever they wanted the people tobelieve. Other non-American journalists were arrested and a Spanish newsphotographer, Juantxu Rodriguez, was shot dead by US soldiers while he wastaking incriminating pictures of what was really happening. There is, in fact,no independent footage of the three days of the invasion, only what the Bushgovernment said had happened, and the Bush forces took over Panamaniantelevision stations to broadcast their own propaganda. Can you imagine what theUnited States and Britain would say if any other country did this? These two arethe bullies of the world. It was the same with those who campaigned fordemocracy or opposed the US invasion. Thousands of such people on the“dissident” lists (human rights campaigners, independent newspaper editors,union leaders and so on) were jailed without trial or even charge. Some stayedthere for years. This systematic cover-up hid the fact that thousands ofcivilians were killed by the Bush invasion, not the 250 he claimed, and thattens of thousands were made homeless. Mass graves have since been uncovered ofthose who died unreported at the hands of Bush. (See the superb video, ThePanama Deception,58 which has pictures that Bush and his henchmen worked so hardto suppress).Bush the child abuserGeorge Bush and his associate Henry Kissinger are mass murderers on a scale thatbeggars belief and so are those who support them and make it possible. The listof Illuminati slaughter and financial manipulation goes on and on with themanufactured wars and the CIA/British Intelligence-imposed dictators and killersplaced in power across the world in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Korea, Nicaragua,Panama, Grenada, Indonesia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan to name only afew. The dead, maimed, starving, destitute and dispossessed that have ensued canbe numbered in billions of our fellow men, women and children. Now they havelaunched a “war on terrorism” that allows them to target any country theychoose. But then why should people who sexually and violently abuse and murderlittle children have any emotional attachment to the suffering they dailyorchestrate? Far fetched? No, no. If you read The Biggest Secret, Children OfThe Matrix, and other books by researchers and victims of these people, you’llsee this is no fantasy. George Bush, for example, is a notorious paedophile,torturer and killer of children among those who have researched this. In a bookcalled Trance-formation Of America,59 Cathy O’Brien, a mind-controlled slave ofpeople like Bush and Dick Cheney for the first 30 years of her life, tells ofher own and her daughter’s abuse by Bush. Daughter Kelly was only a small childwhen Bush began his sexual and violent abuse of her, born as she was into thecaptivity in which her mother had long been imprisoned. This is just one of herexperiences with President George Bush, father and controller of George W. Bushin the “war on terrorism. Alex Houston was her CIA handler in the US governmentmind-control programme known as MK Ultra:> “Kelly became violently, physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s> ‘neighborhood’ and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter,> she ran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilizing headaches> for an average of three days. These were the only telltale evidences aside> from the scarring burns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call a doctor,> and Kelly forbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head ‘hurt> too bad even to move’. And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often> complained of severe kidney pain and her rectum usually bled for a day or two> after Bush sexually abused her. My own mind-control victimization rendered me> unable to help or protect her …> “Kelly’s bleeding rectum was … one of [the] … physical indicators of George> Bush’s pedophile perversions. I have overheard of him speak blatantly of his> sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to> ‘pull my strings’ and control me. The psychological ramifications of being> raped by a paedophile president are mind shattering enough, but reportedly> Bush further reinforced his traumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASA> electronic and drug mind controlled devices. Bush also instilled the ‘Who ya> gonna call?’ and ‘I’ll be watching you’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing> her sense of helplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a> child now seem trite in comparison to the brutal, physical and psychological> devastation that Bush inflicted on my daughter.” 60This man was in the White House for 12 years and now his son is president. Sucha mentality would not plan and execute what happened on September 11th, an eventthat has so massively advanced the Illuminati agenda for a global fascist state?You must be joking. It is their modus operandi in every way.SOURCES > 1Brian Downing Quig, Who Dismantled Our Constitution?, Grapevine (January 2nd> 1995)> 2New Yorker (November 27th 1989), p 108> 3Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips, Trance-Formation Of America (Reality> Marketing Inc., Las Vegas, USA, 1995)> 4Anton Chaitkin and Webster Griffin Tarpley, George Bush, The Unauthorised> Biography (Executive Intelligence Review, Washington DC, 1992)> 5See http://serendipity.magnet.ch/jsmill/bushcrimefamily.htm> [http://serendipity.magnet.ch/jsmill/bushcrimefamily.htm] for this information> and a long list of links detailing Bush family crimes> 6http://serendipity.magnet.ch/jsmill/bushnz1.htm> [http://serendipity.magnet.ch/jsmill/bushnz1.htm]> 7Monetary and Economic Review, December 1992,> http://www.dcia.com/campaign.html [http://www.dcia.com/campaign.html]> 8Russell S.

From the moment of birth, probably even before if you read of theIlluminati “in the womb” techniques described in The Biggest Secret, he was,like his father, groomed and moulded to serve the Illuminati cause, and a lookat his background presents September 11th and current events in a very differentperspective. He attended Yale University and was initiated into the Skull andBones Society and later Bohemian Grove before studying, at least in theory, atthe Harvard Business School. Bush avoided the draft to Vietnam, a war createdand perpetuated by the Illuminati who controlled his father. Washington Poststaff writers George Lardner Jr and Lois Romano revealed in an article in 1999how two weeks before he was due to graduate from Yale, Bush arrived at theoffices of the Texas Air National Guard at Ellington Field outside Houston andsaid he wanted to sign up for pilot training.1 This was on May 27th 1968 whenthe Vietnam War was at its peak with some 350 Americans dying every week andgoodness knows how many Vietnamese. In 12 days’ time he would have lost hisstudent immunity from the draft and so he grasped, with his father’s help, anescape route from combat by joining the National Guard. Father George was atthis time a Congressman for Houston, and a supporter of the Vietnam conflict andthe policy of sending American soldiers there to suffer and die.Many of the American elite were trying to pull the same trick for their sons andthe National Guard had a long waiting list. Not only that, Boy George had scoredonly 25% in a pilot aptitude test and that was the lowest acceptable grade. Thatwill surprise no one with a brain who sees him today, and all these factorsshould have prevented his admission and, therefore, his avoidance of the draftto Vietnam. Yet, wait for this … Boy George was sworn in as an airman with theTexas Air National Guard on the same day that he applied. Colonel Walter B.“Buck” Staudt, the commander of the 147th Fighter Group, even staged a specialceremony later so he could be photographed administering the oath for Bushinstead of the captain who had sworn in Bush earlier. Staudt did the same whenBush was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Lloyd Bentsen Jr, a major TexasDemocrat, ensured that his son, Lloyd Bentsen III, was enlisted into theNational Guard by Staudt around the same time as Bush. Both were nominated forpromotion to first lieutenant on the Election Day in 1970 when Father Bentsenbeat Father Bush for a seat in the Senate. Other Vietnam avoiders in the TexasNational Guard included the son of Republican Senator John Tower and at leastseven members of the Dallas Cowboys American football team. The Washington Postarticle revealed:> “One address for those seeking help getting in was Ben Barnes, a Democrat who> was then the speaker of the Texas House and a protégé of Governor John B.> Connally. A top aide to Barnes, Nick Kralj, simultaneously served as aide to> the head of the Texas Air National Guard, the late Brigadier General James M.> Rose.> “An anonymous letter addressed to a US attorney in Texas, produced in a> discovery proceeding for an ongoing lawsuit, charged that Barnes assisted Bush> in getting into the Guard. The suit was brought by the former director of the> Texas Lottery Commission, who believes that Barnes, now a lobbyist, may have> played a role in his dismissal.> “In a deposition for the suit, Kralj confirmed that he would get calls from> Barnes or his chief of staff, Robert Spelling, ‘saying so-and-so is interested> in getting in the Guard.’ Kralj said he would then forward the names to Gen.> Rose.” 2When the obvious questions were asked about this at the time of Bush’s run forthe presidency, Staudt said that no favouritism had been shown to him. You are aliar Colonel Staudt, as any idiot can see. Talking of which, Bush claimed he didnot join the National Guard to avoid the Vietnam War that he and his fathersupported, but rather because he wanted to be a fighter pilot. OK, insult myintelligence some more. Even on his National Guard application forms he tickedthe box saying, “do not volunteer” when asked if he wanted to go overseas. Notonly did he avoid going to Vietnam, he was even able to live in his then hometown of Houston while learning to be a pilot who was never to face a conflict.He served as an F-102 pilot with the Texas Air National Guard to avoid the draftto Vietnam and became a hard-drinking, cocaine-snorting, womaniser before“discovering Jesus” (I know, I know, of course that last bit is ludicrous, butthis is the official story). On November 5th 1977 the annual anniversary of theGuy Fawkes (Percy-Bush family) plot to blow up the British Parliament, Bushmarried former teacher and librarian, Laura Welch, who is used to smokescreenhis real lifestyle, and they have two teenage daughters, Barbara and Jenna.Snort, snortBush’s drug habit was brought to public attention – and then buried by the media– with the publication of the book, Fortunate Son: George Bush and the Making ofa President, in 1999. The author J.H. Hatfield was subjected to a nationalcampaign of character assassination after he claimed that Bush was arrested ondrug charges in 1972 while serving with the National Guard, but that this hadbeen wiped from the record by a Republican judge and friend of his father inexchange for Bush’s participation in a community service programme calledProject PULL in Houston’s inner city. The author cites three anonymous sourcesto support his claim. What is for sure is that suddenly, and for no crediblereason, this hard-drinking playboy felt an overwhelming desire to volunteer towork with black inner-city kids in Project PULL. After Hatfield’s character wasattacked by the media and pressure from the Bush camp, the publisher, StMartin’s Press, withdrew the book. But in early 2000 it was republished by SoftSkull Press, a small title on New York’s Lower East Side, and the publisher,Sander Hicks, released a document from the Texas Air National Guard, whichreveals that Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a medical examin the same period that Hatfield says he was busted for cocaine possession.Bush’s 175-page National Guard service records were obtained by Hicks from theDepartment of Defense through the Freedom of Information Act. They note theverbal orders of the “Comdr on 1 Aug 72” suspending Bush, a 27-year-old firstlieutenant, for “failure to accomplish annual medical examination” whilestationed at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. Hicks, who says he knows theidentity of the three unconnected Hatfield sources, writes:> “Where was George W. Bush in 1972? Our author, J.H. Hatfield, cites three> sources close to the Texas governor in the Afterword to Fortunate Son who> state Bush had a cocaine arrest ‘fixed’ by his father in Houston in 1972. No> one has adequately explained why he had a sudden charitable desire to perform> community service at Project PULL, an inner-city youth center. Ironically,> government documents note during the same period Bush’s flying suspension for> failure to take an annual medical examination, even though the Republican> presidential candidate has repeatedly stated he was a healthy young man at the> time. Combined with the new introduction to the book that cites an> on-the-record admission by Michael Dannenhauer, former chief of staff to the> elder Bush, that George W. was ‘out of control’ in his abuse of cocaine and> alcohol and experienced ‘lost weekends in Mexico’ in the ‘70s, the Defense> Department document adds further credibility to Hatfield and “Fortunate Son.’”> 3We should also note that this medical Bush failed to take included a drug test.The London Sunday Times reported in April 1972 that the Pentagon had ordereddrug tests at least once a year for officers on “extended active duty”,including reservists like Bush. Publisher Sander Hicks quotes MichaelDannenhauer as saying: “There was cocaine use, lots of women, but the drinkingwas the worst.” Bush lies yet again when he says that his 1972 flying suspensionwas because his doctor was in Houston while he was in Alabama working on apolitical campaign. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Lou Kaposta told SoftSkull Press:> “According to my background of many years as a pilot in the Air Force, you> have to take the annual physical as scheduled. You do not have a choice about> when, where or how. You’re in the military; the individual’s desires don’t> count. Everybody knows that.”4Former Staff Sergeant Mark Wilson, a veteran of the Texas Air National Guard,said there was “something fishy” about Bush’s explanation. He told Soft SkullPress that Bush was stationed very near to Maxwell Air Force Base at the timeand could easily have travelled there. Wilson also pointed out that Bush’sinitial physical exam, while still at Yale in 1968, was done at Westover AirForce Base in Massachusetts.5 So why did Bush only want to be examined by “hisdoctor” at the very time that Hatfield claims he was arrested for drug offences?James Howard Hatfield, the 43-year-old author of Fortunate Son, was found deadin his hotel room in Springdale, Arkansas, on July 18th 2001. Police said he hadcommitted “suicide” from an overdose of prescription drugs. Hatfield left a wifeand a daughter. Pope John Paul II was reported to have commented on Hatfield’sdeath to reporters outside the Basilica of St Peter after saying mass:> “I met Jim Hatfield in Chicago when Fortunate Son was getting reprinted. He> shook my hand and gave me a signed copy. I gave him my blessing and told him> to go forth and speak the truth. He said, ‘I am already doing that, Father’.> We had a laugh together. They tell me he’s dead now … very tragic. He will be> remembered in a series of special masses. I am sure that he is in heaven with> our Lord, Jesus Christ, who said [in Matthew 5:1–2]: ‘Blessed are you when> they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you for my> sake. Rejoice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven, for they> persecuted the prophets who were before you.’” 6Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles Police Department narcoticsinvestigator, goes further in his monthly newsletter, From The Wilderness.7 Hesays that George W. Bush and his brother, Jeb, now Governor for Florida, werefilmed in a 1985 “sting” by the US Drug Enforcement Agency at Tamiami airportoutside Miami. Ruppert quotes statements made by Terry Reed, who took part indrug operations for the CIA and the Bush family involving the notorious andself-confessed drug smuggler Barry Seal, who was murdered when he began to talktoo much. (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free and Reed’s book, Compromised:Clinton, Bush and the CIA.)8 Ruppert says they arrived on the Bush plane KingAir from the Intermountain regional airport at Mena, Arkansas, to pick up twokilos of cocaine from Seal. Mena was the location of the infamous andwell-documented Mena airstrip drug operations involving the then ArkansasGovernor, Bill Clinton (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). There are someinteresting connections between this area, the Rockefeller family, Wal-Martstores and China highlighted on the website of researcher and investigativejournalist Sherman Skolnick.9 What’s for sure there is no way that the Bush sonshave not been involved in drug trafficking when their father is one of the mostactive drug barons in America, possibly the world. Terry Reed quotes in his booka conversation with Barry Seal about the Bush family drug operations. He saysthat Seal told him:> “Ever hear the old expression, it’s not what ya know, it’s who ya know? Well,> whoever said that just hadn’t caught the Vice President’s kids in the dope> business, ’cause I can tell ya for sure what ya know can definitely be more> useful than who you know …”Reed asked Seal if he was saying that Father George Bush’s kids were in the drugbusiness:> “Yup, that’s what I’m tellin’ ya. A guy in Florida who flipped for the DEA> [Drug Enforcement Administration] has got the goods on the Bush boys. Now I> heard this earlier from a reliable source in Colombia, but I just sat on it> then, waitin’ to use it as a trump card, if I ever needed it. Well, I need ta> use it now. I got names, dates, places … even got some tape recordin’s. Fuck,> I even got surveillance videos catchin’ the Bush boys red handed. I consider> this stuff my insurance policy … Now this is real sensitive shit inside of US> Customs and DEA and those guys are pretty much under control.” 10Barry Seal’s “insurance” did not prove too effective, however, because he wassilenced before he could tell his story to a bigger audience. In February 1986,soon after he began to speak out, he was murdered at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Itwas blamed officially on two Colombian hitmen with Mac-10 machine guns, butwhile they may or may not have been the actual killers, the assassination wasordered by the highest levels of the United States government to stop hisrevelations about the Bush and Clinton involvement in the drug racket throughMena, Arkansas. Clinton said at a press conference at the time that he knew verylittle about Seal, but a number of people reported seeing them dining togetherat Fu Lin’s, one of Clinton’s favourite restaurants in Little Rock.11 NoelleBush, the 24-year-old daughter of Jeb Bush, was arrested in January 2001 forprescription drug fraud involving an anti-anxiety drug similar to Valium.12 Iunderstand her need for that after being brought up by the Bush family andliving with Jeb at the governor’s mansion in Florida. With stunning hypocrisy,Jeb Bush said at the time: “Unfortunately, substance abuse is an issueconfronting many families across our nation …” 13 Yes, but not every family hasmade billions from making those substances available on the streets of America.Stewart Webb is a private investigator who has uncovered the Bush familyconnections to the drugs trade and the major American financial firms wholaunder the money for them. He said:> “George Jr., Jeb and Neil Bush were all party to the crimes involving drugs> and gun money laundering through Silverado Savings in Denver. They were all> aware of ‘poppy’ George’s schemes using CIA, Israeli Mossad, Homestead Air> Force Base and Mena, Arkansas to import drugs and ship weapons.” 14Yes, weapons to terrorists! Webb also highlights the Bush family involvement infinancial fraud and murder, but his calls for a Grand Jury investigation intohis findings have been ignored.The Bush – Bin Laden connectionYou will have noted earlier how Father George went to war against formerbusiness and CIA associates like Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega. Such peopleare friends while they are useful and foes when they are either a liability ormore useful as enemies in the battle for control of human perception. These arefodder in a game that is far bigger than such people understand. You mightexpect, given this pattern, that the Bush and bin Laden families would have ahistory of connections and cooperation. And yes, so they have. The officialstory is that the bin Laden family has broken ties with Osama, their terroristrelative, but the only evidence we have for this are statements made by the binLaden family and US Intelligence and government sources. What the hell kind ofproof is that when they all have a stake in the public believing this version ofevents? Many others doubt these claims, and I agree. To say all ties have beensevered is nonsense. The San Antonio Express-News quoted Yossef Bodansky, thedirector of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, assaying that “Osama maintains connections” with some of his nearly two dozenbrothers, but he would not elaborate.15 The FBI must have had their doubtsbecause it subpoenaed banks used by the bin Laden family in search of recordsdetailing their financial activities, according to a source quoted by the WallStreet Journal.16The BBC’s Newsnight current affairs programme revealed that far from acceptingthat the bin Laden family is innocent of any criminal activity, members of theirclan were being investigated by the FBI before September 11th. Reporter GregPalast presented an FBI document with the code 1991-WF-213589, which revealedhow agents of the Washington field office were investigating Abdullah bin Laden,the president, treasurer and US Director of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth(WAMY) on the grounds of national security.17 WAMY has been suspected of fundingterrorism, including the al-Qaeda* network of Osama bin Laden. His brothers,Abdullah bin Laden and Omar bin Laden, another FBI suspect, lived in theWashington suburb of Falls Church, Virginia, at 3411 Silver Maple Place. This isclose to the headquarters of WAMY in the basement at 5613 Leesburg Pike, and twoblocks away is the house at 5913 Leesburg where four of the alleged hijackersnamed by the FBI after September 11th are said to have stayed.18 This area isclose to the CIA headquarters at Langley. WAMY says it’s a charity, but aboutthe same time as the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Pakistani authorities expelledWAMY representatives. Officials in India also claimed that WAMY was funding anorganisation connected to bombings in Kashmir. The Philippines military saidthat WAMY was funding Islamic insurgency.19George W. Bush, who claims to be so determined to stop the funding of Osama binLaden, has not frozen WAMY’s assets, and Joe Trento, a “national securityexpert”, told Newsnight that the FBI wanted to continue its inquiries into WAMYand Abdullah bin Laden, but was not allowed to do so. Trento said he hadobtained a secret file which revealed that FBI investigations considered thatWAMY fitted the pattern of organisations funding terrorism that had beenbankrolled by the Saudi royal family (who are “advised” by Father George Bush)and some of the 20,000 Saudi princes. Back in the early 1990s WAMY was beingnamed as a channel for public and private Saudi donations to hardline Islamicorganisations. One recipient of WAMY support has been the Students IslamicMovement of India that supported Pakistani-backed terrorists in Kashmir andwants an Islamic state in India.20 Reporter Greg Palast said that Newsnight haduncovered a long history of shadowy connections between the US State Department,the CIA and the Saudis. Michael Springman, the former head of the American visabureau in Jeddah from 1987 to 1989, told Newsnight:> “In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department> officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants. These were, essentially,> people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I> complained bitterly at the time there. I returned to the US, I complained to> the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of> Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General’s office. I was met with> silence.> “What I was protesting was in reality an effort to bring recruits, rounded up> by Osama bin Laden, to the United States for terrorist training by the CIA,> who then returned to Afghanistan to fight against the then Soviet Union.” 21This was during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and their war with theCIA-backed Mujaheddin, including Osama bin Laden. In the period Springman istalking about here, between 1987 and 1989, Father George Bush, the former headof the CIA, officially took control of the White House after being president, infact if not name, under Ronald Reagan. Newsnight also quoted “a highly placedsource in a US intelligence agency” as saying there had always been“constraints” on investigating Saudis and that, under President Boy George Bush,it had become much worse. FBI agents felt that their investigations into theSaudi connection were being obstructed from the highest level in Washington,Newsnight reported, despite terrorism against Americans being blamed on Osamabin Laden and his Saudi-based backers. These included the bombing of the WorldTrade Center in 1993, which killed six people and injured a thousand, and theKhobar Towers at a US military complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, three yearslater in which 19 Americans died and some 500 were injured. This was blamed onOsama bin Laden and yet his family business, Bin Laden Construction, was giventhe contract by the US to replace it!22Bush blocks bin Laden investigationNewsnight reported that after George W. became president, FBI agents were toldto “back off” investigations into the bin Laden-Saudi connection. Greg Palastsaid that just a few days after September 11th, and while Muslim “suspects” werebeing rounded up all over America, a special charter flight flew 11 members ofthe bin Laden family out of the United States to Saudi Arabia from the sameBoston Airport from which the attacks on the World Trade Center had beenlaunched. As I mentioned, Yossef Bodansky, director of the House Task Force onTerrorism and Unconventional Warfare, said that bin Laden maintains connectionswith some of his nearly two dozen brothers, although he would not elaborate.23Osama bin Laden has been ostracised and disinherited by his family? Like hell hehas and the Bushes, the bin Ladens and the Saudi royal family are all extremelyclose. This is confirmed by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie in theirFrench book, Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth. Brisard is a private intelligenceanalyst who compiled a report for French intelligence in 1997 about thefinancing of “bin Laden’s” al-Qaeda terrorist network and Dasquie is editor ofIntelligence Online. Brisard says they prove in their book that at least until1998 bin Laden was able to use economic and financial structures in Saudi Arabiaand had contacts with various Saudi officials. After all, the Saudis weresupporting the Taliban, who were protecting him in Afghanistan. “In SaudiArabia, the left hand ignores the right hand,” Brisard says, “and the FBI wasfully aware of the situation.” 24 Brisard reveals in his book that John O’Neill,the FBI’s former deputy director and head of anti-terrorism, resigned in July2001 because the Boy Bush State Department was blocking the investigation intothe bombing in the Yemen of the USS Cole, an attack blamed on bin Laden. Brisardsays that O’Neill told him: “The main obstacles to investigating Islamicterrorism were US oil interests and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.” WhenBrisard asked him why the US was unwilling to go after the states that host binLaden, he said “because of oil”. Brisard revealed in an Internet interview: “Iquote [O’Neill] saying that everything about bin Laden and al-Qaida can beexplainable through Saudi Arabia.” 25In the greatest of “coincidences”, John O’Neill left the FBI to become head ofsecurity at the World Trade Center and died in the attacks on September 11th. Itwas apparently his first day in the job. Lawyer Michael Wildes gave some 14,000documents to the FBI implicating Saudis in the funding of terrorism. They camefrom a defecting Saudi diplomat represented by Wildes, but the lawyer says thatFBI agents told him they were “not permitted” to read them and would not takethem.26 He said of the FBI:> “They’re cut off at the hip sometimes by supervisors or given shots that are> being called from Washington at the highest levels … You see a difference> between the rank-and-file counter-intelligence agents, who are regarded by> some as the motor pool of the FBI, who drive following diplomats, and the> people who are getting the shots called at the highest level of our> government, who have a different agenda – it’s unconscionable.” 27In the wake of September 11th, FBI Special Agents were furious with the waytheir investigations into potential terrorists and their funding were blocked.One filed an official complaint with legal representation from David Schippers,the man who led the attempted impeachment of Bill Clinton, and Judicial Watch,the private Washington organisation that investigates and prosecutes officialcorruption. FBI Special Agent Robert Wright, Jr, who spent four years trackingterrorist money laundering in the United States, believes that if investigationshad been allowed to continue, the attacks on the World Trade Center could havebeen stopped.28 Wright told the media in May 2002 that the FBI operation,code-named “Vulgar Betrayal”, confiscated funds that were directly linked toSaudi Arabian businessman Yassin Kadi, also known as Yassin al-Qadi, who hassince been identified as one of the “chief money launderers” for Osama binLaden. Wright said that FBI management “intentionally and repeatedly thwartedand obstructed” his efforts to expand the investigation to arrest otherterrorists and seize their assets. In August 1999 he was removed from theoperation, which was then shut down. “As a direct result of the incompetenceand, at times, intentional obstruction of justice by FBI management to preventme from bringing the terrorists to justice,” he said, “Americans haveunknowingly been exposed to potential terrorist attacks for years.”29 Longbefore September 11th lawyer David Schippers tried himself to warn AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft about the concerns of FBI agents that a terrorist attackon lower Manhattan was planned, but he never received a reply. Schippers wascontacted by a number of genuine FBI agents about their concerns. He describedthe investigations into the funding of terrorism:> “This agent here in Chicago filed the affidavit where he laid out the whole> way that the money moves, the way that its handled, how it comes out of the> Middle East into the Chicago area, not only Chicago, but into the United> States, how it’s covered, how the operatives are covered, and then how the> money gets back, how it’s transferred back, and where it’s kept while it’s> here. And that affidavit ran like 30 pages – laid it out … He had to go> through hell on earth in Washington. He had to fight like a tiger. Everybody> in his own bureau and in the Department of Justice was against him and still> is.30Bush and bin Laden: business partnersSo why would the US government want to block investigations into Osama bin Ladenand other terrorist networks? Here’s why. Boy George was a disastrousbusinessman when he followed his father, or “Poppy”, into the oil and gasindustry, but he was always bankrolled or manipulated out of trouble by hisfather and his friends. He launched his own drilling company in June 1977 in theTexas oil town of Midland. It was called Arbusto Energy and the “bust” in thename was very appropriate. “Arbusto”, however, means “shrub” in Spanish (againspot on), although it seems his family believed it translated as bush. Now … oneof the investors in Baby Bush’s Arbusto venture was one Salem bin Laden, a closefriend of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and brother of the “world’s most wantedman,” Osama bin Laden. The Saudi Bin Laden Group, formerly Bin Laden BrothersConstruction, is one of the biggest construction companies in the Middle Eastwith some 40,000 employees, and it has long associations with the US governmentand prominent American families. This was the company that helped to buildAmerican airfields in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War and, as we shall see,built the cave and tunnel complexes with CIA funding that the United Statesbombed during the attacks on Afghanistan after September 11th. Charles Freeman,president of the Middle East Policy Council (funded by the bin Laden family) andformer US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, says: “If there were ever any companyclosely connected to the US and its presence in Saudi Arabia, it’s the Saudi BinLaden Group.”31 Wayne Fagan, a San Antonio attorney who represented Salem binLaden from 1982 to 1988, told the San Antonio Express-News that his client was“a good friend of the US government”.32 Salem bin Laden, investor to George W.Bush, became head of the bin Laden companies with the death in a plane crash ofthe family patriarch, Sheikh Mohammed bin Laden, in 1968. The Sheik left hisindustrial and financial empire to some 54 sons and daughters from a list ofwives. Salem bin Laden, the oldest son, took over the estate in 1972.Salem bin Laden became a business partner of George W. Bush through a middlemancalled James R. Bath, a close friend of the Bush family and best buddy of BoyGeorge. They “served” in the same Texas Air National Guard unit. Indeed, thedocument obtained by Soft Skull Press, which reveals how Bush was suspended fromflying in the same period that J. H. Hatfield said he was busted for cocaine,shows that his friend, Major James R. Bath, also failed to take his annualmedical examination and was suspended from flying! It was shortly after FatherGeorge became director of the CIA in 1976 that Salem bin Laden appointed Bath,the very close friend of “Dubya”, to represent his “business interests” out ofthe Bush family stronghold of Houston, Texas. Bill White, a former real estatepartner of Bath, said that Bath told him he was an asset of the CIA and that “hehad been recruited by [Father] George Bush himself in 1976 when Bush wasdirector of the agency … he said Bush wanted him involved with the Arabs, and toget into the aviation business”. During this early period as an asset of Bush’sCIA, Bath was at Boy George’s side when he ran unsuccessfully to be governor ofTexas in 1978 and Bath (the bin Laden family?) helped to finance the campaign.Bill White’s claims forced Bath to admit in sworn depositions that herepresented four wealthy Saudi Arabian businessmen as a trustee and used hisname on their investments in return for a 5% commission on their business deals.At the same time Bath, the buddy of Boy George, was both put on the CIA payrollby Father George to get involved with the Arabs and the aviation business, andappointed by Salem bin Laden and other bin Laden-connected Arabs as their Texasrepresentative. This connection led to Salem bin Laden investing in George W.Bush’s Arbusto oil company.The allegations of Bill White that his former partner James Bath channelledmoney from Middle Eastern clients to American companies to influence thedecisions of the Reagan-Bush administrations were “investigated” by theFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a division of the JusticeDepartment. But, of course, nothing came of it. White told a Texas court in 1992that Bath and the Justice Department had “blackballed” him professionally andfinancially because he refused to stop revealing his knowledge of the Arab moneypaid into the bank accounts of American businesses and politicians. At the timeof this Justice Department “review” of Bill White’s evidence, a senior positionin the department was held by Robert Mueller. This same Robert Mueller wasappointed head of the FBI by George W. Bush and took over just two weeks beforeSeptember 11th. This is the FBI from which the official story of 9/11 has come.The head of the Justice Department’s criminal division under President FatherGeorge, which cleared major players in the BCCI scandal, including Bush, wasalso … Robert Mueller. Having a few little doubts about Mueller’s FBI version ofSeptember 11th? Yeah, me too.Boy George, the bin Ladens, and the BCCIBy 1977, using Bath as the middleman, Salem bin Laden was investing in Dubya’sArbusto drilling company. This association continued, not least through theIlluminati’s BCCI, which provided “banking services” for the Medellin drugcartel, Khun Sa (a major player in the heroin trafficking out of Asia), ManuelNoriega, Saddam Hussein, and terrorists like Abu Nidal, who, according to theformer German Defence Minister and overseer of German intelligence, Andreas vonBulow, is an “instrument of Mossad”, the Israeli intelligence agency.33 The BCCIwas also the main route for the funds of CIA covert operations that involved theIran-Contra scandal and the funding of Osama bin Laden and others in Afghanistanwho were resisting the Soviet Union occupation in the 1980s during theReagan-Bush era. The result of this CIA funding through the BCCI and othersources was the creation of the Osama bin Laden network and the coming to powerof the Taliban regime. The Bush family were massively involved with the BCCI andthese super-rich Middle Eastern families, like the bin Ladens. Ed Rogers, FatherGeorge’s White House political director, who sat in on presidential meetings,left to work for Sheikh Kamal Adham, the American representative of the BCCI andsignificantly a former chief of Saudi intelligence and a friend of AdnanKhashoggi, the infamous arms dealer. Khashoggi is a business associate of FatherGeorge Bush and one-time brother-in-law to Mohamed al-Fayed. When Father Bushwas asked if he was concerned that a senior member of his staff had left torepresent a Saudi sheikh accused of being a key player in the BCCI scandal, hesaid Rogers was free to do whatever he chose and Bush’s only concern was thatthe White House was “beyond any perception of impropriety.” 34 Note … not beyondimpropriety, just any perception of it. Rogers was hired to ensure goodcommunications between the sheikh and Bush. As a Senate investigation into theBCCI revealed, Rogers left the White House and was paid $600,000 to do next tonothing. It was the same with his assistant, Haley Barbour, who would turn uplater as the chairman of the National Republican Committee. The Senateinvestigation concluded that hiring Rogers and giving “gifts” of money to thepresident’s son, George W. Bush, were designed to influence Father Bush’spolicies in relation to the BCCI.35 Like his father, Salem bin Laden died in aplane crash near San Antonio on Memorial Day, May 29th 1988. It is amazing howdangerous flying can be when you get involved with the Bush family and theirIlluminati associates. Indeed it was considered an unexplainable “freak”accident with bin Laden, a very experienced pilot, inexplicably turning hisultralight aircraft the wrong way on take-off and hitting power lines. Or so thestory goes.Bush associate finances bin LadenBush buddy James Bath made his fortune from commissions for investing the moneyof Salem bin Laden and another Saudi who becomes very significant in the tale.This is Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, another investor in a George W. Bush oilcompany. Bin Mahfouz was the operational director of the BCCI and a controllingshareholder with a 20% stake between 1986 and 1990. He is one of the world’srichest men and … a financial supporter of Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network!His sister is a wife of Osama bin Laden, as revealed by CIA Director JamesWoolsey in his testimony to the Senate in 1998.36 Khalid bin Mahfouz and Salembin Laden were closely associated and Dubya’s close friend James Bath worked forboth of them, as he did for Gaith Pharaon, the BCCI’s front man in Houston’sMain Bank and a close associate of bin Mahfouz. In 1978, Bath bought Houston’sGulf Airport for Salem bin Laden and when he died in the “ultralight crash”ownership passed to bin Mahfouz. He has a big estate in Houston, the home baseof Father George. Bath was also president of Skyway Aircraft Leasing Ltd, aTexas air charter company registered in the Cayman Islands, which was reallyowned by bin Mahfouz according to published reports in the early 1990s.37 Therewas a long association between Boy George’s associate James Bath and binMahfouz. Bath received a “loan” of $1.4 million from him in 1990.Khalid bin Mahfouz is from the Yemen, as were the bin Ladens originally. He wasfor many years the banker to Saudi Arabia’s King Fahd and to Father George Bush.Bin Mahfouz was known as “the king’s treasurer” in Saudi Arabia. Yet after theterrorist attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s, which wereblamed on Osama bin Laden, President Clinton’s Secretary of State MadeleineAlbright informed the Saudi Defence Minister, Prince Sultan, that bin Mahfouzhad channelled tens of millions of dollars into terrorist groups throughaccounts in London and New York. According to USA Today, quoting “intelligencesources”, bin Mahfouz and other Saudis combined to transfer $3 million tovarious Osama bin Laden front operations in Saudi Arabia in 1999.38 The paperreported that a year after bin Laden was blamed for the attacks on US embassiesin Africa, Khalid bin Mahfouz and other wealthy Saudis ordered the NationalCommercial Bank (owned by bin Mahfouz and used by the bin Laden family)39 totransfer funds to the Capitol Trust Bank in New York City. This money wasdeposited with Islamic charities connected to the bin Laden network in theUnited States and United Kingdom.40 The organisations alleged to have been usedby bin Mahfouz and associates to fund terrorist groups, especially bin Laden,include: the London-based Advice and Reformation Committee; Blessed Relief, anAfrican aid group whose directors included bin Mahfouz’s son, Abdul RahmanMahfouz; a Kenya branch of Help Africa People, controlled by people laterconvicted or indicted for the US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; theInternational Islamic Relief Organization, which has been linked with terroristbomb plots in the Philippines and India; the Kenya branch of MercyInternational, a war and famine relief group where evidence used to convict theembassy bombers was found; and a list of other organisations, some of which havebeen named by President Bush since September 11th as fronts for terrorism (heshould know).41Here’s another example of how small the world is at this level. The CapitolTrust Bank through which at least some of these funds for Osama bin Laden aresaid to have been channelled is run by bin Mahfouz associate Mohammad HusseinAl-Amoudi, who is also alleged to have funded bin Laden. Al-Amoudi’s lawyer hasbeen Vernon Jordan, the close associate of Bill Clinton and friend of MonicaLewinsky. Jordan was for many years a senior executive in the law firm Akin,Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld in Washington, along with several close friends ofthe Bush family. In January 2000 Jordan moved to the New York investment bank ofLazard Freres, but retains close connections to the law firm he has served since1982. He also sits on the boards of major corporations like American Express,the Revlon Group, Xerox Corporation and Dow Jones.42 Akin, Gump represent someinteresting combinations of people and organisations. These include bin Mahfouzand Al-Amoudi, who are alleged to have funded Osama bin Laden; they also handlethe affairs of many leading Saudis through the Akin, Gump office in the capital,Riyadh; and they represent the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation for Relief andDevelopment, which had its assets frozen by the US Treasury pending aninvestigation into alleged connections to the Palestinian terrorist group,Hamas.43 Bin Mahfouz retained the services of Akin, Gump during the“investigation” into the BCCI.44The National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia, reported to be the world’s biggestprivate bank, was owned by bin Mahfouz, but he was forced to step back when anaudit by the Saudi government revealed that $2 billion was “missing”. There has,of course, been much speculation into where, or more to the point, to whom, thatmoney went. I emphasise again, the National Commercial Bank is one of the majorbanks used by the bin Laden family empire and the royal family of Saudi Arabia.Bin Mahfouz was put under “house arrest” and the last I heard he was “living inluxury at a military hospital in the northern city of Taif, where he isallegedly undergoing treatment for a drug problem”. Taif is only a shortdistance from the bin Laden family headquarters in Jeddah. Bin Mahfouz also hadto hand over the Irish passports he had bought for millions of dollars forhimself, ten of his wives, and business associates. Nothing really changed,however, because another family member, Mohammed bin Mahfouz, took over theNational Commercial Bank along with close family business associate, MohammedHussein Al-Amoudi, who is based in Ethiopia and heads a vast network ofcompanies involved in oil, banking, mining and construction. These include theCapitol Trust Bank that was named by the Clinton administration as a vehicle forfunding Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network. The bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudifamilies control three private Saudi Arabian oil companies and are partners withUnited States firms in a series of major oil development and pipeline projectsin central and south Asia. Of course, the Bushes, Vice President Dick Cheney andmany others in the US government are closely involved with the oil cartel. TheMahfouz-Al-Amoudi companies, Delta Oil, Nimir Petroleum and Corral Petroleum,formed international consortiums with United States oil giants Pennzoil (Bushfamily), Texaco, Unocal, Amerada Hess and Frontera Resources. Unocal is aTexas-based group that has been planning to build a massive pipeline acrossAfghanistan, but could not do so while the Taliban was in power. Despite theirconnections with Osama bin Laden, these US companies, bin Mahfouz and Al-Amoudi,have not had their assets frozen in the Bush sham to “stop money reachingterrorist organisations”. The American publication, Village Voice, was thereforeright to conclude:> “It is most curious that the son of former CIA Director George Bush does> business with the brother of Osama bin Laden in the setting up of businesses> which seem very tied to the CIA – while at the same time a woman with CIA ties> and who is married into the family of former CIA Director Richard Helms> represents the Taliban, protector of Osama bin Laden. This coziness among the> CIA and bin Laden families all suggest to me that perhaps Osama bin Laden may> still very much be a CIA-protected operative, and makes me very nervous about> who really orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.” 45What a tangled web we weave …Once again, bin Mahfouz, the financial supporter of Osama bin Laden, was aninvestor in a George W. Bush oil company. Dubya’s original company, Arbusto,went through changes of name with each financial failure. It became BushExploration when Father George became US Vice President and in September 1984this survived only by merging with Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation. With BoyGeorge appointed president of Spectrum, this of course also failed, and mergedwith Harken Energy in 1986. He was a shareholder, director and adviser to Harkenand, a year later, with Harken now in trouble, along came the “investment” byOsama bin Laden supporter, Khalid bin Mahfouz.46 He paid $25 million to acquirea 17.6% stake in the company through his US representative, Abdullah TahaBakhsh. Mahfouz at the same time was a 20% controlling shareholder in BCCI,which official investigations revealed to be financing terrorist groups,unlawful “intelligence” operations and laundering vast amounts of drug money.Despite being a leading figure in the BCCI while it perpetrated the biggestfinancial fraud in history, bin Mahfouz escaped all liabilities, except for a$225-million-dollar settlement agreed with New York “prosecutors”. This was pinmoney for him. With the Bush family so heavily involved in the BCCI it is not asurprise that it should be connected to the companies of George W. Bush.Hey, Jack’s backAbdullah Taha Bakhsh also purchased a 9.6% stake for bin Mahfouz in the WorthenBanking Corporation in Arkansas, owned by another significant character in thestory, Jackson Stephens, who funded Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign andmuch of his political career. Bakhsh’s purchase was identical to the shares inWorthen sold by three investors, Bill Clinton, Pat Robertson, the television“evangelist” (see Children Of The Matrix), and Mochtar Riady, the head of anIndonesian family that has close connections to the Chinese communists.47Jackson Stephens was a major financial supporter of Bill Clinton, but is also aclose associate of the Bush family in America’s one-party state. He was alsoclosely connected with the BCCI and the Bush banker and bin Laden funder, Khalidbin Mahfouz. In a sworn statement for his lawsuit against Father George, theformer Green Beret, William Tyree, said that Stephens “paid off politicians fromArkansas to look the other way and ignore the CIA cocaine operation at Mena,Arkansas.” 48 In 1987, Stephens, who was also linked to the Clintons’ Whitewaterproperty scandal through the Worthen Bank, invested $25 million in … BoyGeorge’s Harken Energy. The deal was set up in Geneva and the money paid throughUnion des Banques Suisses and Banque de Commerce et de Placements, a Genevabranch of the BCCI. The deal was signed by Stephens and Abdullah Taha Bakhsh,the representative of bin Mahfouz. Stephen’s company, Stephens Inc., donated$100,000 to Father George’s re-election campaign in 1991, despite being a funderof Bill Clinton. His wife, Mary Anne Stephens, ran Father George’s presidentialelection campaign in Arkansas in 1988 and when Boy George was manipulated intothe presidency with the fixed vote in Florida in 2000, Jackson Stephens made aconsiderable contribution to the cost of his inauguration bash. Forget the“two-party” or “multi-party” state deal. It doesn’t exist. These guys are maskson same face. When you observe the fundamental and constant connections betweenthe Bushes, the bin Laden family, their cronies and investors, and the BCCI,including its operational director Khalid bin Mahfouz, it is sobering to notethat a 400-page French parliamentary report, published on October 10th 2001,said that the Osama bin Laden financial network bore a striking resemblance tothat of the BCCI.Loser takes it allDubya’s family and business connections made him a fortune from his failed oilcompany in its various incarnations. With Arbusto failing, he was made presidentof the company that bought it, Spectrum 7 Energy, and was given 14% of its stockwhile other Arbusto investors were paid 20 cents on the dollar. When Spectrum 7lost $400,000 in six months Bush sold to Harken Energy and again received alarge stock holding and a big salary as consultant and director. While FatherGeorge was US President in 1990, his son’s Harken Energy was given a lucrativecontract by the government of Bahrain even though Harken had never drilled awell overseas or offshore. The deal was brokered in part by David Edwards, oneof Bill Clinton’s closest friends, and a former employee of Stephens Inc., ownedby Jackson Stephens. Clinton himself is a gofer for the Bushes and Rockefellers.The contract was awarded to Bush’s company thanks to Sheikh Kalifah, the PrimeMinister of Bahrain, another BCCI shareholder.49 Jonathan Beaty and S.C. Gwynnein their book, The Outlaw Bank: A Wild Ride Into the Secret Heart of the BCCI,write that “Knowledgeable oil company sources believe that the Bahrain oilconcession was indeed an oblique favor to the president of the United States butsay that Saudi Arabia [home of bin Laden] was behind the decision.”50 Choosing asmall company with no track record was indeed a strange decision unless you knowthe background and personnel. Harken immediately subcontracted the work to theCIA-connected Global Marine and no oil was found. Bahrain officials say they hadno idea that the President’s son was involved with Harken when they awarded thecontract. No, honest, they really said that.Above the lawInsider trading – using privileged information to trade stocks – is strictlyillegal and yet how can the following not be considered so? Two months beforeIraq invaded Kuwait on June 20th 1990, Boy George suddenly sold two-thirds ofhis stock in Harken Energy, and the 121,140 shares netted him $848,560 – that’s$318,430 more than they were worth according to Dr Arthur F. Ide, the author ofGeorge W. Bush: Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative51 Eight days after Bushsold his stock, Harken announced second quarter losses of $23 million, SaddamHussein then invaded Kuwait and the value of the company plummeted 75%. As Idewrote: “George W. broke the law to [sell his shares] since the transaction wasan insider stock sale.”52 Bush was cleared, however, by an investigation by theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an Illuminati front dealing infinancial law. It prosecutes those the Illuminati want to destroy and clears theones they want to protect. An Associated Press report pointed out:> “At the time of the investigation, Bush’s father was President of the United> States and the SEC was run by one of his biggest political supporters, Richard> Breeden. The SEC’s then-general counsel, James R. Doty, was another staunch> presidential supporter who as a private attorney was George W. Bush’s lawyer> when he purchased his share of the Texas Rangers baseball team.” 53Yet another stitch-up and there’s more. Bush was defended in the investigationby the Dallas attorney, Robert Jordan. When he became US President, Boy Georgeappointed Jordan as his ambassador to Saudi Arabia – a country that was tobecome extremely important a few months later when the “war on terrorism” waslaunched. This is, of course, the base of the bin Laden family and other Bushand terrorism funders like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Jordan has no diplomaticexperience, but that’s not the point. As always it is his loyalty to the Bushfamily that counts.Must be genetic …When faced with questions about his bin Laden connections, President Dubyadenied at first ever knowing his long-time friend and bin Laden family businessassociate, James Bath. This was an outrageous and a ludicrous lie. He thenagreed that Bath had invested in Arbusto and that he knew he was arepresentative of Saudi Arabian interests (the bin Laden family and Khalid bin“BCCI” Mahfouz). Bush also lied to the Wall Street Journal when he said he had“no idea” that the BCCI was involved in Harken Energy’s finances. In fact,Harken’s affairs were awash with people directly connected to the BCCI. TheJournal quite rightly concluded that “The number of BCCI-connected people whohad dealings with Harken – all since George W. Bush came on board – raises thequestion of whether they mask an effort to cozy up to a presidential son.” 54 Infact, it goes far, far, deeper than that. The Bush family is crooked to the coreand the children have been brought up to be that way. Dubya’s brother Neil Bushwas fined $50,000 in 1990 and banned from banking activities for his role intaking down Silverado Savings and Loans, a failure that cost taxpayers $1.3billion and resulted from the “Reaganomics” policies of the 1980s that wereorchestrated by the real power in the Oval Office, George Bush. Father Georgewas US President when Silverado collapsed. A Resolution Trust Corporation suitagainst Neil Bush and other officers of Silverado was settled for $26.5 million.He voted to give $100 million in “loans” (bad ones it turned out) to two of hisbusiness partners while failing to tell his fellow board members at Silveradothat they were his business partners. Federal banking investigators alsofollowed the trail of defaulted loans to Neil Bush oil ventures like JNBInternational, an oil and gas exploration company that was awarded drillingconcessions in Argentina even though it had no experience of international oiland gas drilling. Heard that story somewhere before? Neil Bush now runs an“educational software” company called Ignite out of Austin, Texas, and inJanuary 2002 he was the keynote speaker at an “international forum” in Jeddah,Saudi Arabia, home of the bin Laden family, and they were the main backers ofthe event.55The Carlyle Group – a name to rememberKhalid bin Mahfouz, the financial backer of Osama bin Laden and George W. Bush,is also an investor in the Carlyle Group, the international consulting andinvestment firm of Father George. It was founded in 1987 and named after thefavourite New York hotel of the company’s initial investors, the high-IlluminatiMellon family, the close friends of the British royal family and the forcebehind the lie that fluoride is good for you (see And The Truth Shall Set YouFree and The Biggest Secret). The Carlyle Group also has very close links withthe bin Laden family, who have been both clients and investors. Father Bush hasbeen a paid consultant to the Bin Laden Group. Reports in the Wall StreetJournal say these Carlyle investments have been earning the bin Laden familysome 40% a year on their money since 1995.56 So when the US boosts its militaryspending, as it has so massively done in the “war on terrorism”, bin Ladenfamily investments in a defence contractor like Carlyle clearly benefit.According to the New York Times: “Carlyle has ownership stakes in 164 companieswhich last year employed more than 70,000 people and generated $16 billion inrevenues. About 450 institutions – mainly large pension funds and banks – areCarlyle investors …” 57 Carlyle owns a wide range of companies involved in“health care”, real estate, the Internet, bottling plants, the media (including,it is reported, the French newspaper, Le Figaro), as well as companies producingtanks, aircraft parts and a long list of other military equipment. It is now amajor player in defence contracting and telecommunications and invests incompanies that do business with governments or are affected by governmentregulations. The Wall Street Journal called the Carlyle Group “… awell-connected Washington merchant bank specializing in buyouts of defense andaerospace companies.” 58 Almost two-thirds of Carlyle’s investments are indefence and telecommunications companies that are fundamentally affected bychanges in government spending and policy because they know they can influenceboth, especially if one of your leading lights has his son in the White House.Dubya, himself, was an investor and board member of the Carlyle subsidiary,Caterair.Well, well, what a line-upFather George sat on the Carlyle board and is still very much involved as aconstantly active senior consultant who nets, apparently, between $80,000 and$100,000 for every speech he makes on its behalf. He is also the senior adviserto Carlyle’s Asian Partners fund.59 Another Carlyle stalwart is James Baker,Bush’s Secretary of State at the time of the Gulf War, and the man who wasallocating contracts to American corporations to clear up the oil fires inKuwait even before the conflict began. Baker is on the Carlyle board, as isformer Reagan-Bush Defense Secretary, Frank Carlucci, who is the Carlylechairman and managing director. Carlucci was number two at the CIA during theVietnam War, assistant director of the CIA during the Jimmy Carter presidency,and both Secretary of Defense and National Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan(George Bush). He is also a past chairman of Nortel Networks Corp., which hasbeen a partner of the Bin Laden Group in telecommunication deals. Karl Evanzz inhis book, The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X,60 says that Carlucci’sappointment as consul and second-secretary of the US Embassy in Stanleyville,the Congo, was a cover for a CIA operation that included the plot to assassinatethe recently elected President Patrice Lumumba in 1961. When someone is freelyelected to serve the people and not the Illuminati they must be removed. Fivemonths after Lumumba was assassinated, Carlucci was arrested, expelled from theCongo, and returned to the US. He was expelled again in 1965, this time fromTanzania, after he was implicated in the CIA assassination of the Burundi PrimeMinister Pierre Ngendandumwe. This is the man who now heads the Carlyle Groupwith its fundamental connections to the Bush and bin Laden families.In relation to the agenda behind the “war on terrorism”, it is important to notethat Carlyle’s Carlucci and James Baker are close friends and associates of thecurrent US Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Baker was a classmate ofRumsfeld at Yale University and Carlucci was Rumsfeld’s roommate at Yale.61Secretary of State Colin Powell has also described Carlucci as his “mentor”.Carlucci admits that in February 2001 he met with Rumsfeld and Vice PresidentDick Cheney, the Gulf War Defense Secretary to Father George, to talk aboutmilitary policy. This was at a time when Carlyle had several defence projectsworth billions of dollars under consideration. How hilarious, therefore, are thecomments of Carlucci when he said: “I’ve made it clear that I don’t lobby thedefense industry. I will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might doand whom they should talk to. But I do not pick up the phone and say you shouldfund X, Y or Z.” 62 Then there are the claims of David Rubenstein, one ofCarlyle’s founders and a former aide to the Jimmy Carter administration that wasserved at the CIA by Carlucci. Rubenstein said: “Mr [Father George] Bush givesus no advice on what do with the federal government. We’ve gone over backwardsto make sure that we do no lobbying.” 63 To quote Santa Claus: “Ho, ho, ho.” Buteven funnier was the claim by Daniel A. D’Aniello, a Carlyle managing director,that “We are greatly assisted by Baker and Bush … [because] … It shows that weare associated with people of the highest ethical standards.” That’s about aswrong as any sentence has ever been in all human history. Charles Lewis, theexecutive director of the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity, hit thebutton when he said:> “Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can> possibly be. [Father] Bush is getting money from private interests that have> business before the government, while his son is president. And, in a really> peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day [some day??] benefit financially> from his own administration’s decisions, through his father’s investments. The> average American doesn’t know that and, to me, that’s a jaw-dropper.” 64The connections go on and on. Dallas attorney Robert Jordan, who defended GeorgeW. Bush against claims of insider trading and was appointed Bush’s ambassador toSaudi Arabia, is a corporate lawyer in the Dallas office of Houston-based BakerBotts, lawyers to the Carlyle Group. The current “Baker” in Baker Botts is JamesA. Baker III, Father George’s Secretary of State and a major player in theCarlyle Group. Baker Botts has an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the firm’sclient list includes “more than half of the Fortune 100 companies” and the Bushoil company Pennzoil. The former UK Prime Minister, John Major, was also hiredas a European consultant to Carlyle and was made chairman for Carlyle Europe inMay 2001. He has travelled with Bush promoting Carlyle interests. Major wasPrime Minister when the BCCI scandal broke in 1991, just as Bush was presidentin the United States. Lord Howe, who was Deputy Prime Minister and HomeSecretary in Major’s government, also sits on Carlyle’s European board. Howemade a crucial contribution to the removal from office of Margaret Thatcher whenthe Illuminati, via its Bilderberg Group, had decided she had become a liabilitybecause of her opposition to the European superstate.Other Carlyle directors and consultants include Fidel V. Ramos, the formerPhilippines President; Richard Darman, Father George’s former Budget Director;Robert Grady, former assistant to Father George; Park Tae Joon, former PrimeMinister of South Korea; Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC); Michael Orloff, former general director of the WorldHealth Organization; J.H. Binford Peay, retired US Army General; JohnShalikashvili, former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff; Karl Otto Pohl,former president of Germany’s Bundesbank; and Sami Baarma, director ofPakistan’s Prime Commercial Bank in Lahore, which is owned by … Khalid binMahfouz. Baarma (also Baarama) is a director of Lebanon’s Credit Libanaise,which is owned by the Mahfouz family. This Carlyle line-up of global influencealso involves the past or present chairmen of BMW.; drug giant Hoffman-LaRoche;Nestlé; LVMH-Moët Hennessy; Louis Vuitton; and Aerospatiale, the French Airbuspartner. Such connections have ensured massive growth for Carlyle. As the NewYork Times article noted of Father George’s role:> “In getting business for Carlyle, Mr Bush has been impressive. His meeting> with the crown prince [of Saudi Arabia] was followed by a yacht cruise and> private dinners with Saudi officials, including King Fahd, all on behalf of> Carlyle, which has extensive interests in the Middle East.> “And Mr Bush led Carlyle’s successful entry into South Korea, the> fastest-growing economy in Asia. After his meetings with the prime minister> and other government and business leaders, Carlyle won a tough competition for> control of KorAm, one of Korea’s few healthy banks.”The article goes on:> “In a new spin on Washington’s revolving door between business and government,> where lobbying by former officials is restricted but soliciting investments is> not, Carlyle has upped the ante and taken the practice global. Mr Bush and Mr> Baker were accompanied on their trips by former Prime Minister John Major of> Britain, another of Carlyle’s political stars. With door openers of this> calibre, along with shrewd investment skills, Carlyle has gone from an unknown> in the world of private equity to one of its biggest players. Private equity,> which involves buying up companies in private deals and reselling them, is a> high-end business open only to the very rich.” 65Carlyle and the bin LadensThe Washington-based Judicial Watch, a law firm that investigates and prosecutesgovernment corruption, has highlighted the staggering fact, reported in the WallStreet Journal, that Father George works for the bin Laden family through theCarlyle Group and has met with them at least twice in November 1998 and January2000. Baker and Carlucci have also made the pilgrimage to the bin Laden family’sheadquarters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Father George issued a statement throughhis chief of staff, Jean Becker, to say he only recalled one meeting with thebin Laden family – in 1998 – but when Becker was read Bush’s thank you noteafter another meeting with the bin Ladens, she suddenly confirmed they had infact met twice. Yes, and the rest. This connection with the bin Ladens hascontinued while Osama bin Laden has been the world’s most wanted man and theFBI, according to news reports, subpoenaed bin Laden family business records.However, Charles Freeman, president of the Middle East Policy Council and formerUS Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, says that two of the bin Laden brothers have toldhim since September 11th that the FBI has been “remarkably sensitive, tactfuland protective” of the family because of its “long standing friendship with theUS”. Another former US President, the Rockefeller-funded Jimmy Carter met withten of Osama’s brothers early in 2000 on a fundraising trip for the CarterCenter in Atlanta.66 He met with Bakr bin Laden in New York in September 2000and the bin Ladens handed over $200,000 to the Carter Center. Casper Weinberger,the former US Defense Secretary to Reagan-Bush who was charged over Iran-Contraand pardoned by Bush, is now the chairman of the New York publisher, Forbes Inc.He confirmed that Forbes executives and staff also made two visits to the binLaden family headquarters in Jeddah.67 The Carlyle Group, of course, is far fromthe only connection between the Bush and bin Laden families as we have seen, butthis alone is outrageous in the circumstances. Larry Klayman, the chairman andgeneral counsel of Judicial Watch, said:> “This conflict of interest has now turned into a scandal. The idea of the> President’s father, an ex-president himself, doing business with a company> under investigation by the FBI in the terror attacks of September 11 is> horrible. President Bush should not ask, but demand, that his father pull out> of the Carlyle Group.” 68But of course that didn’t happen because both Bushes are up to their eyes in allthis and Daddy calls the shots anyway. The Carlyle Group, clients to Osama binLaden’s family and associated with bin Laden funder Khalid bin Mahfouz, was oneof the major financial supporters (together with Enron) of George W. Bush’s runfor the presidency! Wake me up.Looking after daddyThe London Times reported an investigation into the illegal investment of publicfunds in the Carlyle Group through a web that leads back to George W. Bush.Reporter Tom Rhodes revealed the role of Wayne Berman, a former AssistantSecretary of Commerce in the Father George administration, who representsCarlyle. His company, Park Strategies, was involved in the transfer of $800million in 1998 from the Connecticut state pension fund into private venturesand $50 million of this was placed in a Carlyle fund. As a result of thisinformation, Berman, who denies any wrongdoing, resigned as a “pioneer”, one of400 elite supporters selected to raise money for Boy George’s presidentialcampaign. Rhodes goes on to explain how Dubya was also connected to investmentof public funds in Carlyle. A month after he became Texas Governor, he was givena campaign contribution of $25,000 from Thomas Hicks, a multi-millionaire whoBush later placed on the Board of Regents at the University of Texas along withTom Loeffler, a former Republican congressman and Washington lobbyist for Hicks,and Don Evans, an oil company executive, close friend of Bush, and later hispresidential campaign manager. With support from Bush, Hicks used his owninvestment company as the university’s broker and formed a corporation calledthe University of Texas Management Company to invest the university’s assets,totalling some $13 billion. Shortly afterwards, the Hicks-controlled,Bush-appointed and supported regents handed over $10 million to the CarlyleGroup, which employs his father! When Don Evans released the names of theDubya’s “pioneers” at the heart of his record-breaking presidential fundraisingcampaign, they included Steven Hicks (the brother of Thomas Hicks), TomLeoffler, Wayne Berman, three partners in Vinson and Elkins (the law firm thatserves as counsel to the University of Texas Management Company), and two othermen who benefited from Texas University investments. Oh yes, and the Texasteachers pension fund invested $100 million with Carlyle. The board that madethis decision was appointed when George W. Bush was Texas Governor.69What a cheekWhen you see all the connections between the Bushes and the Middle Easternfinancial networks supporting people like Osama bin Laden, it is hard to evencomprehend the level of pure, undiluted, bare-faced, hypocrisy that George W.Bush had to summon in the wake of September 11th when he told a White House newsconference about his “crackdown” on those who do business with terrorists andthe supporters of terrorists. He said in the White House Rose Garden onSeptember 24th:> “US banks that have assets of these groups or individuals must freeze their> accounts. And US citizens or businesses are prohibited from doing business> with them.” He said it was “a strike on the financial foundation of the global> terror network. If you do business with terrorists, if you support or succour> them, you will not do business with the United States.”That applies to everyone it seems, except the Bush family, and their masters andcronies. I wonder what this means for the major British bank, Barclays plc,which is a “core investor” in a merchant bank set up on Guernsey in the ChannelIslands in 1996 by Khalid bin Mahfouz, Osama bin Laden’s brother-in-law?Barclays went into business with bin Mahfouz five years after he was involved inthe world’s biggest bank fraud, the BCCI.70Saudi Arabia, a 51st state (one of many)The endless connections between the Bushes, the Saudi Arabian royal family,elite Saudi business families, like the bin Ladens, and the terrorist networks,becomes understandable when you consider that Father George Bush, his mastersand associates, control Saudi Arabia. Cathy O’Brien, a mind controlled slave topeople like Father Bush and Dick Cheney for decades, saw at first hand what isreally going on behind the smoke and mirrors. She writes in her book,Trance-Formation Of America:> “Saudi Arabia threaded in and out of most operations in which I was involved,> primarily due to their purchase and routing of weapons, drugs, and> blond-haired, blue-eyed programmed children. According to George Bush’s> claims, Saudi Arabia was in essence a controlled financial arm of the United> States. Saudi Arabian King Fahd and his Ambassador to the US, Prince Bandar,> provided a front for the unconstitutional and criminal covert operations of> the US. This included the arming of Iraq and the Nicaraguan Contras; US> involvement in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal;> and funding the Black Budget through purchase of our nation’s children to be> used as sex slaves and camel jockeys.> “Since the US ‘won’ control of the drug industries through the so-called Drug> Wars, Saudi Arabia played an integral part in their distribution. It was my> experience that Bush’s claim of having Saudi Arabia King Fahd as his puppet> was, in fact, reality.” 71Cathy also tells of how she was forced by Dick Cheney, then US DefenseSecretary, to have sex with King Fahd, which, to a large extent, was part of theoperation to blackmail him into total compliance, should he ever think ofrefusing an order. Who are the financial advisers to the Saudi royal family? TheCarlyle Group. Who was their banker? Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder of Osama binLaden. Are we to believe that the Bush family and their associates who have somuch control over Saudi Arabia could not have caught Osama bin Laden years agoand destroyed the business networks close to King Fahd that have funded him andothers? So why didn’t they do it? Because they wanted that funding to happen andthey wanted bin Laden to be built up into a global monster because it suitedwhat they had planned in New York and Washington for September 11th 2001.Anthrax scares are good for businessOh yes, some more facts about the Carlyle Group. As a major defence contractor,it benefits massively from wars like those in Afghanistan and others in the “waron terrorism”. According to the investigative journalist Sherman Skolnick,Carlyle owns a major slice of BioPort, the company that controls the US supplyof the anthrax vaccine much used in the wake of September 11th when mysteriouspackages containing anthrax were posted to various addresses in America. Thevalue of the vaccine soared after the packages began to appear and one of themajor beneficiaries has been … yes … yes … the bin Laden family – anotherinvestor in BioPort! 72 So, too, is Fuad El-Hibri, a Saudi businessman close tothe bin Laden family, who is President and Chief Executive Officer of BioPortCorporation.73 You could not make this up. Another beneficiary is AdmiralWilliam Crowe, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when American-producedweapons-grade anthrax was being supplied to Saddam Hussein for use in the waragainst Iran. He served at the Pentagon for a time under Secretary of DefenseFrank Carlucci, now chairman of the Carlyle Group. Admiral Crowe, a member ofthe Illuminati’s Council on Foreign Relations and former US Ambassador toLondon, now owns 13% of BioPort Corporation and sits on the board. BioPort hasone customer, the US Department of Defense, and one product – anthrax vaccine.It is the only US Corporation with a license to make anthrax vaccine and thelicence was acquired in 1998 by buying the laboratory where the vaccine is made,the Michigan Biologic Products Institute. President Bush is not keen for thepeople to know the background to BioPort and its owners. Investigative reporterSherman Skolnick writes:> “Under the disguise of invoking national emergency provisions, George W. Bush> has ordered National Guard sentries to guard the BioPort facility in Lansing,> Michigan. Bush has ordered, under pretext of ‘national security’, that> employees and officials of BioPort are forbidden to discuss with reporters,> commentators, and researchers, the nature of the ownership of BioPort> Corporation. This was done to preclude details of this private corporation> from being publicly disclosed. This presidential edict was quietly put through> just prior to the beginning of bombing by the US of Afghanistan. Despite this> clamp-down on disclosure, some very patriotic employees of BioPort have> informed independent-minded commentators of the reputed ownership and> operations details of BioPort Corporation.” 74BioPort’s sole customer is the US Department of Defense, which has pouredmillions of dollars into the company to keep it going while it has supplied only4% of the contracted vaccine. The Defense Department advanced $18 million oftaxpayers’ money in 1999 and another $24 million in 2000 and yet now theinvestors in the company, like the Bushes and bin Ladens, make fantastic profitsbecause of the anthrax scare. Similarly, in 1996 when the Khobar Towers USmilitary quarters in Saudi Arabia was hit by a terrorist truck bomb blamed onOsama bin Laden, his family business made a fortune with the contract from theUS military to replace it and build military barracks and airfields for UStroops! 75 The anthrax drug, Cipro, which increased its sales by 600% afterOctober 2001, is produced by the German Illuminati company, Bayer, formerly partof I.G. Farben, the very heart of Hitler’s war machine and the operation thatran the concentration camp at Auschwitz (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free).Eberhard von Kuenheim, a former chairman of Bayer, works for the Carlyle Group.President George W. Bush has resisted all pressure to remove Bayer’s patent andopen the way for much cheaper generic versions, even though Bayer was apparentlycharging $350 for a drug you can buy in India for $10 to $20.“Ken who?”The Enron Corporation was the biggest financial backer of George W. Bush in hispresidential election campaign and has been financially supporting his careersince he was governor of Texas. You would, therefore, expect that it would be acesspit of deceit and corruption. It was formed in 1985 by the merger of HoustonNatural Gas and Internorth, and was based in the Bush home base of Houston,Texas. The following year Kenneth Lay, a member of the Illuminati TrilateralCommission, and close friend and associate of the Bushes, was made chiefexecutive officer and later became chairman. Enron threw money like confetti atBush and more than 250 senators and congressmen, and it bullied and manipulateda massive expansion of its global holdings helped by the nose-in-the-troughpoliticians on its payroll across the world. The technique was simple. TheIlluminati forced the “liberalisation” and “opening up” of national energysupplies in developing countries and elsewhere, and Enron then secured thecontracts to supply energy in those countries, often funded by “foreign aid” andWorld Bank money. Everywhere they went, power prices soared at the expense oflocal people and, in California, they conspired with other power companies tocreate false “shortages” and blackouts to justify massive multi-billion-dollarinvestment by the state for increasing energy supply. However, Enron was usingdeeply corrupt accounting administered by the Arthur Andersen Group to hide itsfantastic debts and exaggerate its earnings by hundreds of millions. Eventually,like its banking “mirror” the BCCI, the house of straw came down amid a frenzyof document shredding in December 2001 in the biggest corporate bankruptcy inAmerican history. Those responsible, like chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO JeffreySkilling, made multi-millions by selling their shares at the top of the marketbefore, as they knew, the share price would collapse to the floor. Shareholders,including thousands of Enron employees who had been encouraged to buy shares bythe company, lost everything, including, for thousands, their jobs. Kenneth Layalone sold shares worth $119 million before the collapse and no wonder he couldafford to donate $290,000 to the George W. Bush presidential campaign. Skillingsold some 10,000 shares a week to secure $66.9 million, and a group of 29 Enronexecutives and directors received $1.1 billion by selling 17.3 million sharesbetween 1999 and mid-2001. They knew what was coming, but they cut and ran whilethousands of workers and small shareholders lost billions and many theirretirement pensions.PaybackBut right up to the end, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were trying to provideKenny Boy with value for money. Lay served on the Bush transition team after hisrigged November 2000 “election”, and he helped to interview candidates for theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. This oversees the gas pipelines andelectricity grids that are fundamental to Enron’s business! 76 Curtis Hebert,the chairman of the Commission, said he was “offended” by Lay’s efforts to lobbyfor Enron and Hebert later resigned.77 Enron executives were appointed toprominent positions in the Bush administration. Larry Lindsey, his ChiefEconomic Adviser, and Robert Zoellick, his leading trade negotiator, were bothadvisers to Enron and the Secretary of the Army, Thomas White, was an Enronexecutive before joining the Bush administration.78 Karl Rove, Bush’s senioradviser, was an Enron shareholder who took part in many government meetingsabout energy policy. In February and March 2000, soon after the Bushinauguration, Kenneth Lay met Vice President Cheney and energy policy wasmodified to suit Enron. In May, Cheney issued a statement opposing caps onenergy prices in California after a memo from Lay suggesting that he do justthat. In all, Lay and Enron were consulted six times before Cheney announced hisenergy policy.79 Cheney has refused to make public the documents and details ofwhat was discussed at these meetings or even allow access to the GeneralAccounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The White House “energytask force” was controlled by the energy industry and part of its final reportinvolving the policy on global warming was taken almost word for word from apolicy paper issued by an energy industry trade group.80When the Enron scandal broke, of course, President Boy Bush did what the Bushfamily always do. He lied. He played down the relationship and referred to Layas just a “supporter”. Charles Lewis, Director of the Center of PublicIntegrity, said there was no doubt about the very close ties between Enron andBush: “Enron was the number one career patron for George W. Bush. There was nocompany in America closer to George W. Bush than Enron.” 81 Then in February2002 some two dozen letters written by Lay to the then Governor Bush werereleased from Texas archives after requests by the media and the watchdog group,Public Citizen. They include holiday and birthday greetings and get well notes.In one letter sent in 1997, Bush says: “Laura and I value our friendship withyou.” A note in the same year from Lay to Bush thanks him for his support forEnron’s efforts to supply electricity for Philadelphia, then governed by TomRidge, who was appointed head of Homeland Security by Bush after 9/11. “I verymuch appreciate your call to Tom Ridge a few days ago,” Lay wrote, “I am certainthat it will have a positive impact on the way [Ridge] and others inPennsylvania view our proposal.” 82 Bush first met Lay in the late 1980s and yethe said he only knew him after he became governor of Texas in 1994. EventuallyWhite House Communications Director Dan Bartlett had to admit to the ChicagoTribune that the relationship between Bush and Lay probably began in 1987 and1988 when they worked on Father Bush’s presidential election campaign. “He methim through his father and through his father’s political activity,” saidBartlett. “He does not recall specifics.” 83 I bet he doesn’t. Bush and Enronwere one unit and both share a life-long addiction to deceit and corruption.Other “Enron”-type accounting scandals have followed with companies likeWorldcom. This is, in part, a manifestation of the cesspit in which the globalcorporations operate, but it is also connected to the Illuminati plan to crashthe world economy by destroying confidence in it. With the economy in ruins theywould have a problem-reaction-solution to bring in their centralised control ofeverything. Incidentally, Richard Breeden, the man appointed court monitor ofWorldCom after the accounting scandal broke, was the Father Bush-appointedChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission that cleared Boy George ofinsider trading with Harken Energy.Coup on AmericaAfter Boy George’s business failures in the oil industry, in which he massivelybenefited financially thanks to other people’s money, he turned to baseball. Heand a group of partners bought the franchise of the Texas Rangers in 1989. Bushwas the general manager and this was part of the strategy designed to give him apositive profile in Texas with a view to him running for governor again. This hedid with the money power behind him and he was elected Governor of Texas inNovember 1994, after which he became the most enthusiastic enforcer of capitalpunishment in America. The plan soon became clear – another Bush was beinggroomed for the presidency. He was re-elected governor on November 3rd 1998 with68.6% of the vote. Two years later, almost to the day, he was the 43rd Presidentof the United States, as I had predicted he would be some three years earlier.You only had to know his bloodline and see the way his political profile wasbeing raised to realise that he was the chosen one. As a result, hispresidential campaign broke all records for fundraising and, before June 2000,he had attracted donations of $37 million thanks to Enron, the Carlyle Group andthe rest of the Illuminati campaign to put their man in the White House.His “opponents” were the Arizona Republican, John McCain, in the race for theRepublican nomination for president, and the then Vice President Al Gore for thepresidency itself. Both of these “opponents” knew they were not meant to winbecause Bush was the president-in-waiting. The Illuminati had enough dirt onboth of them to stop any true exposé of George W. Bush during the campaigns.Gore is also bloodline although his DNA connections are not as impressive asBush’s in the Illuminati genetic hierarchy. Again with Gore’s insider knowledgeof the Bush family he could have destroyed Dubya, but with Gore also heavilyinvolved in the same horrific behaviour, and well aware of the dire consequencesof crossing his masters, Bush was given an easy ride. In the same way, theDemocratic “challenger” Michael Dukakis knew his role and his place when hefaced Father George in the 1988 election before Bush gave way, as planned, toClinton. But even with all the aces in his favour, George W. Bush was such anunimpressive candidate that Gore won the popular vote across the country by halfa million in November 2000. In a truly representative election, that should havebeen enough to put Gore in the White House, but that wasn’t the plan so it wasnot allowed to happen. The US system means that you win presidential “points” orvotes for an “electoral college” based on the states you win (some states areworth more than others) and it all came down, infamously, to the result inFlorida, the state governed by Bush’s brother, Jeb, who, naturally being a Bush,is another monumental crook. Even though the vote in Florida was so obviouslyrigged (to anyone with any brain cell activity), note how meekly Al Goreaccepted it in the end and slipped quietly away. He knew what had happened andhe knew why, and he knew better than to cause trouble serious enough to stopBush taking the throne. As Chicago investigative reporter, Sherman Skolnick, haspointed out, the Florida judiciary is notoriously controlled by the CIA,84which, in turn, is very closely associated with Father George, who had his ownson, Jeb, running Florida during the “election”. Sorry Al, darlin’, you neverstood a chance, mate. Not that he would have been any better had he won. A mediaconsortium of the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, and CNNcommissioned the National Opinion Research Council at Chicago University toinspect 170,000 disallowed votes in Florida to prove who really won the 2000presidential election. The results were ready by the end of August 2001 andmedia reports suggested that the count would show that Gore beat Bush in Floridaconclusively and should have been president. But after 9/11 the media consortiumsaid that the recount had been postponed due to a “lack of resources and lack ofinterest” in the story after the events of September 11th.85 Oh yes? A lack ofinterest in whether you have a legitimate president when he is taking you intoan open-ended war across the world? “Our belief is that the priorities of thecountry have changed, and our priorities have changed,” said Steven Goldstein,the Vice President of corporate communications at Dow Jones and Co, the ownersof the Wall Street Journal.86 My belief is that the media priorities actuallyremain very much the same – suppressing information that doesn’t suit those inpower. Little things, you know, like the fact that the president is an impostor.What happened in Florida was a coup on America and yet the vast majority whowatched it unfold had no idea that an unelected dictator had been imposed ontheir “Land of the Free and Home of the Brave” or, as someone rightly put it:“The Land of the Fee and Home of the Slave.” An investigation by the USCommission on Civil Rights reported that Florida officials (controlledultimately by Governor Jeb Bush) had been responsible for preventing citizensfrom voting in the election. The report called this “widespread”. The commissionsaid the officials were “grossly derelict” in the way they conducted theelection. Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, bothRepublicans, were especially highlighted in the Commission’s report for ignoring“mounting evidence” of problems with outdated voting technology in a number ofcounties, and for ignoring requests for guidance and assistance from localelections officials. These “technical problems” were used as an excuse todiscount tens of thousands of votes, mostly those of black and immigrant workersmost likely to vote for Gore. Remember Bush eventually “won” the state by 537votes. Yet in Palm Beach County, 19,000 ballots were “double-punched” anddiscarded, and in precincts heavily populated by Haitian-Americans, there werereports of ballots that were pre-punched for Bush. Tens of thousands of otherpeople were told they could not vote at all, even though they were carryingvoter registration cards. Palm Beach County was the location of a vote fraud inthe late 1990s in which the Republican mayor was forced to resign because he hadbenefited from an absentee vote fraud organised by his supporters. The FloridaDepartment of Law Enforcement arrested 58 people. Miami Herald columnist DaveBarry wrote:> “Florida’s No 3 industry, behind tourism and skin cancer, is voter fraud. Here> in Miami, we’ve had elections where the dead voters outnumbered the live ones.> Elsewhere in the State there have been reports of irregular voting procedures,> including one Palm Beach County precinct where the ‘ballots’ given to voters> were actually pizza coupons.” 87Bush buys the electionBBC Newsnight reporter Greg Palast, a rare journalist worth the name, revealedthat the Jeb Bush administration in Florida paid a private company calledDatabase Technologies (DBT) $4 million to remove from the voter lists the namesof people who had committed serious crimes.88 Palast obtained a document marked“confidential and trade secret”, which says that the company was paid the moneyto make telephone calls to verify they got the right names. But they didn’t doit. Palast said there was nothing in the State of Florida files that says thesetelephone calls were made and this wrongly barred thousands of Democrat voterswho did not have criminal records from voting in Florida. The first list fromDBT of voters they said should be barred from voting included 8,000 namessupplied by George Bush’s state officials in Texas! They claimed these nameswere all serious criminals barred from voting, but, as Palast said, it turnedout that almost none were. When this was challenged, DBT issued a new listnaming 58,000 felons, but one county that checked the names relevant to itsvoters found that this list was 95% wrong. One of those named, Reverend WillieWhiting, had never spent a night in jail in his life. Palast went to Tallahasseeto question Jeb Bush’s Director of Elections in Florida, Clayton Roberts. “Wewant to know whether George W. Bush won the election or did brother Jeb steal itfor him,” Palast said. Roberts agreed to talk until he realised that Palast hada copy of the secret document relating to DBT and he called the State Troopersto remove Palast and his colleagues. Palast said that he had not asked his mostdifficult questions before the troopers arrived. These were: Did Governor JebBush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections,Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black Democrat votersbefore the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to preventthe count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? In Palm Beach, voting machinesmisread 27,000 ballots, but Jeb Bush’s Secretary of State, Katharine Harris,prevented these votes from being counted by hand. She did the same in Gadstone,one of Florida’s poorest and most Democrat counties, where the machines did notcount one in eight ballots. This same Katherine Harris was Co-Chair of the Bushpresidential campaign!The illegitimate presidentThe US Commission on Civil Rights confirmed that African-American voters wereten times more likely than white voters to have their ballots rejected and thatan “overzealous” state-wide campaign to reduce voter fraud resulted indisproportionately denying eligible African-American voters from casting ballotson election day. It also said that African-Americans (overwhelmingly voters forGore if you look at history) were more likely to have been erroneously removedfrom voter registration rolls than Hispanic or white voters. The reportcriticised local election supervisors in counties hardest hit by votingproblems. It said they showed a “lack of leadership” in protecting votingrights. When the official count and recount using technology gave the electionto Bush by a fraction, despite those thousands of votes lost to Gore, theDemocrats called for a hand count. This was the only way to count the thousandsof votes that were misread by voting machines. This was the only fair way todecide an election that was deciding the president. But the Bush camp wasdetermined that this would not happen because they knew what the outcome of afair count would be: Bush was going to lose. So on to the scene came … oh yes,ladies and gentlemen please welcome … James A. Baker III, the Secretary of Stateto Father George during the Gulf War, and a major force in the bin Laden/binMahfouz-connected Carlyle Group. Baker told the media in Tallahassee, Florida,that he and the Bush camp were applying for a federal injunction to stop a handcount. They were doing this, he said in typical Illuminati reverse language, to… “preserve the integrity and the consistency and the equality and finality ofthe most important civic action that Americans take: their votes in an electionfor president of the United States. We feel we have no other choice.” 89 Noother choice if they wanted Bush to win. They also knew that if they could havethe decision made by the Bush-controlled Supreme Court they were home. In theend, the issue did indeed go to the Supreme Court where, on December 12th 2000,they gave the presidency to Bush by five votes to four, voting on party lines.The decision was utterly perverse because they agreed that in order to haveequal voter protection in Florida the whole state should be recounted, but theyruled that there was not enough time to do this – even though there were stillweeks to go before the electoral votes of all the states had to be officiallyaccepted.90 On this insane basis they gave the presidency to Bush! This is howthe man who has taken the world into a “war on terrorism” came to power.Another point about that Florida election. If you remember, the televisionnetworks that night first called Florida for Gore, then too close to call, andthen for Bush. Well this is what happened.91 In the early hours of electionnight, November 8th, the Fox News Channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, declaredthat Florida had gone for George W. Bush and that he was the new president. Theother television networks repeated this within minutes. The man at Fox whorecommended this decision was John Ellis, who headed the network’s decisiondesk. Ellis, it turns out, is the first cousin of George W. Bush and brotherJeb, the Florida Governor, and, by his own admission, he had been in constantcontact with them all night.92 Investigative reporter Kate Randall revealed:> “Shortly after 6 p.m. two waves of exit polls from the Voter News Service (a> consortium set up by the major TV networks and Associated Press) showed the> Florida vote going for Democratic candidate Al Gore. John Ellis received a> call from the Bush campaign in Austin and told them the bad news. At 7.52 pm> the major networks, including Fox, called Florida for Gore.> “Just after 8 pm, Jeb Bush phoned Ellis and asked him, ‘Are you sure?’, to> which Ellis responded, ‘We’re looking at a screen full of Gore.’ It was at> this point that the Bush campaign – aided by information to which they were> privy via their family connection at Fox – went into overdrive to reverse what> appeared to be a Democratic victory.” 93The Bush camp called a press conference at the Texas governor’s mansion inAustin and said that, in their view, the vote was too close to call inPennsylvania and Florida. The conference broke with previous election-nightprocedure in which candidates don’t speak to the media until one of them hasconceded. As Randall wrote:> “The actions of the Bush campaign constituted a bald-faced attempt to co-opt a> servile media into stampeding public opinion in its favor. The TV networks> broadcast the interview even as large numbers of voters were still heading to> the polls.” 94John Ellis, the Bush cousin at Fox, claims that exit polls by the Voter NewsService showed a change in Florida in Bush’s favour between 8pm and 9pm. Afterthat, all the television networks withdrew the call for Gore and said Floridawas too close to call. Newsweek reported that, after midnight, Bush’s lead inFlorida began to diminish, but despite this, at 2.16am, Fox News called Floridafor Bush on the direction of Bush cousin, John Ellis. Again, within minutes, theother networks followed. Ellis told New Yorker magazine that 16 minutes beforethis decision he had been on the phone to the Bush brothers: “It was just thethree of us guys handing the phone back and forth – me with the numbers, one ofthem a governor, the other the president-elect. Now that was cool.” Randall sumsup this grotesque example of media bias: “In other words, the Republicancandidate, and the governor of the state where the outcome of the race would bedetermined, had a direct line – through their cousin – to a media outlet thatwould broadcast their ‘victory’ nationwide.” 95 With this announcement by Fox,Gore called Bush to concede the election and was about to make his speech givingthe presidency to Bush when he heard that, in fact, Bush’s lead (even with allthose lost Gore votes) was down to a few thousand and falling. Randall quiterightly asks: “Did Ellis, fearing that the networks might move Florida back intothe Gore column, decide to make a pre-emptive strike in the hope of stampedingthe other networks and conning Gore into making a premature concession? Did theBush campaign have a hand in Ellis’s call?” It certainly helped Bush that’s forsure. Mark Fabiani, Gore’s communications director, said: “To have a networklike Fox call it and everybody follow suit was a tremendously damaging thing. Ittook literally 24 to 48 hours to convince people that Gore had won the popularvote.” But, of course, Rupert Murdoch, supporter of Tony Blair in Britain,defended Ellis. No one who believes in fair play and media impartiality would dothat, but this, it goes without saying, is not a problem for Murdoch.This is only a fraction of the horrific background to the Bush family that istaking the world further and further into a war against freedom, decency, andjustice. Al Martin, a retired Lieutenant Commander with the US Naval Reservesand Naval Intelligence, is the author of The Conspirators: Secrets of anIran-Contra Insider.96 Martin claims to have seen at first hand the governmentdrug trafficking, illegal weapons deals and an “epidemic of fraud” – corporatesecurities fraud, real estate fraud, insurance fraud and bank fraud. He writesof the Bush family:> “You have to look at the entire Bush Family in this context – as if the entire> family ran a corporation called Frauds-R-Us. Each member of the family, George> Sr., George Jr., Neil, Jeb, Prescott, Wally, etc., have their own specialty of> fraud. George Jr.’s speciality was insurance and security fraud. Jeb’s> speciality was oil and gas fraud. Neil’s specialty was real estate fraud.> Prescott’s speciality was banking fraud. Wally’s speciality was securities> fraud. And George Sr.’s specialty? All of the above.” 97This is the family of President Bush, who said after the WorldCom scandal thatthere must be “a new era of integrity” in American corporate life.

It makes them feel at home, see. There are fewbetter examples of this than their fellow Bohemian Grove attendee, Dick Cheney,the White House Chief of Staff to President Ford; Father George’s DefenseSecretary at the time of the Gulf conflict; and Vice President to George W. Bushduring the “war on terrorism”.Cathy O’Brien in her book, Trance-Formation Of America, tells of her horrificexperiences of Cheney when she was a victim of the Illuminati/CIA mind-controlprogrammes and Cheney was Defense Secretary to Father George, who sexually andviolently abused her and her little daughter, Kelly. Cathy details in her bookhow she was involved in drug running operations under instructions from Cheney,some of which involved Bandar bin Sultan (Cheney called him “the Sultan”). BinSultan was the deeply corrupt US ambassador to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, theGeorge Bush puppet and close associate of the bin Laden family and terroristfinanciers like Khalid bin Mahfouz. Cathy also describes the constant andsickening brutality that she and her daughter suffered from Cheney and Bush.This was just one occasion:> “Bush attempted to sell Cheney on the idea of pedophillia through graphic> descriptions of having sex with Kelly. Both were already sexually aroused from> drugs and anticipation. Cheney demonstrated to Bush why he did not have sex> with kids by exposing himself to Kelly and saying: ‘Come here.’ Upon seeing> Cheney’s unusually large penis, Kelly reeled back in horror and cried ‘No!’> which made them both laugh. Bush asked Cheney for his liquid cocaine atomizer> as he got up to take Kelly to the bedroom. When Cheney remarked how benevolent> it was of Bush to numb her with it before sex, Bush replied: ‘The hell it is.> It’s for me.’ He described his excited state in typical vulgar terms and> explained that he wanted to spray cocaine on his penis to last longer.> “Cheney said: ‘I thought it was for the kid’.> “Bush explained: ‘Half the fun is having them squirm.’ He took Kelly’s hand> and led her off to the bedroom.> “Cheney told me that since I was responsible for Bush’s assault on my daughter> … I would ‘burn’ (in hell). He burned my inner thigh with the fireplace poker> and threatened to throw Kelly in the fire. He hypnotically enhanced his> description of her burning to traumatize me deeply. As he sexually brutalized> me, I heard Kelly’s whimpers coming from the bedroom. As her cries grew> louder, Cheney turned on classical music to drown out her cries for help.” 1Another time, Cathy tells of what happened when she asked Cheney, amid yetanother brutal beating session, if she could go to the toilet:> “Cheney’s face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my> back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat,> choking me while applying pressure to the carotid artery in my neck with his> thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled: ‘If you don’t mind, I will> kill you. I could kill you – kill you – with my bare hands. You are not the> first and you won’t be the last. I’ll kill you any time I goddam well please.’> He flung me on the cot-type bed that was behind me. There he finished taking> his rage out on me sexually.” 2This is the same Dick Cheney who is US Vice President telling the world who wemust bomb and slaughter to win the “war on terrorism”. It is also worth notingthe unbelievable hypocrisy involved when Boy George, the son of a paedophile andassociate of Cheney, announced an initiative in August 2002 to “protectAmerica’s children”. Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Nebraska in 1941 and wasbrought up in Casper, Wyoming. He is yet another of the clique to hail fromYale, home of the Skull and Bones Society, but he dropped out before eventuallysecuring a degree in political science at Wyoming University. Cheney then headedfor Washington where he joined the Nixon administration as a special assistantto … Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary today in the “war on terrorism”.Rumsfeld at that time was the first director of the Office of [Illuminati]Economic Opportunity. When Nixon resigned over the Kissinger-engineeredWatergate scandal in 1974 (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free), Rumsfeldjoined the White House staff as assistant to the new president, Gerald Ford,another abuser of Cathy O’Brien, and a man who, thanks to Watergate, never hadto be elected and never would have been if the voters had been given a say. Thatwas another coup on America. Ford’s intellectual capacity was akin to that ofGeorge W. Bush and the famous saying that he couldn’t walk and chew gum at thesame time was right on. Cheney moved with Rumsfeld and eventually became Ford’sChief of Staff between 1975 and 1977 when he was still in his early thirties.After the first of several heart attacks, he was elected as Congressman forWyoming and remained in office until Father George made him Defense Secretarywhen he was elected president in 1988. Cheney is yet another of the bloodlinecliques which are keen to send others into battle, so long as they never have togo. He also avoided the draft to Vietnam when he was given deferments because hewas a student and a “registrant with a child”. Just like President “Dubya”, hetold his Senate confirmation hearing that he “would have been obviously happy toserve had I been called”. Funny how they never are, though. In 1964, Cheneymarried his wife, Lynne, another Washington insider. She was head of theNational Endowment of the Humanities from 1986 to 1993 under Reagan and thenBush (or, in truth, Bush and then Bush). She later became a senior fellow at theAmerican Enterprise Institute (where Cheney was also involved between 1993 and1995) and was co-host of CNN’s appalling “debate” show Crossfire Sunday forthree years until 1998. Mrs Cheney was on the Lockheed Martin board from 1994until January 2001 – the very company that the then Texas Governor George W.Bush tried to contract to run the Texas welfare system. Fortunately, publicprotests stopped him. Bruce Jackson, the Lockheed Martin Vice President, was afinance chair of the Bush for President campaign.Dick Cheney became best known during the Gulf Slaughter in 1991 when he workedto ensure the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, now morethan a million when you include the sanctions. Alongside him in thatadministration were President Father George (Carlyle Group), Secretary of StateJames Baker (Carlyle Group) and Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff. Cheney stated that his “defence” policy was “Arms for America’s friendsand arms control for its potential foes.” Which, of course, was baloney. Thepolicy was “Sell second-rate arms to countries that we can then demonise forbeing armed and dangerous, thus giving us the excuse to use our state-of-the-artweapons to blow the shit out of their civilian population.”Big Dick and big businessAfter Bush’s pre-arranged defeat to his subordinate associate Bill Clinton in1992, Cheney moved into “private business” to serve the Illuminati in anotherway pending his return to Washington with Little George nine years later. Cheneybecame fantastically wealthy as a director of elite companies like MorganStanley, Union Pacific, Procter & Gamble, and Ross Perot’s Electronic DataSystems Corporation. His most important appointment, however, came in 1995 whenhe became the Chairman and Chief Executive of the (yet again) Texas-basedHalliburton Oil. This was founded in 1919 and owns a highly significantsubsidiary called Brown & Root. Cheney had no experience in the oil industry,but that’s not why Halliburton offered him the job. He had other “qualities”that would expand their business. While Cheney was Defense Secretary (and beforeand afterwards), Brown & Root has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars’worth of construction contracts in war zones like Bosnia, Somalia and Haitiafter they had been devastated by US bombing and manipulation. In the same way,in July 1999, a Balkan Assistance and Reconstruction Conference in Washington DCwas arranged for Balkan government officials to meet with executives fromCheney’s Halliburton/Brown & Root and other US corporations to plan thefinancial and political needs for the occupation and operation of the Balkans.The technique is this: you control the political decisions to start wars thatsuit your agenda; you lend the governments money to buy armaments from you andthey use your oil to fight the wars; then, when all this has devastated thetarget country and its population, you get yourself awarded the contracts torebuild what you have destroyed. Cheney is the biggest shareholder inHalliburton with a stake of some $45.5 million and the company’s board includesLawrence Eagleburger, who held State Department posts under President FatherGeorge and is an executive of the notorious Kissinger Associates (see And TheTruth Shall Set You Free).Paying for the privilegeHalliburton and Brown & Root have long used political patronage and funding toexpand business and profits. Brown & Root’s ticket to the top came through itspolitical contributions to President Lyndon Johnson from the time he ran forSenate in 1948. The Austin Chronicle once called him “the candidate from Brownand Root” 3 Thanks to Johnson they made billions on government contracts,including those relating to the Vietnam War after Johnson reversed the policiesof the assassinated JFK and plunged America deeper into the conflict. DuringVietnam, Johnson gave his personal funders contracts for airports, pipelines andmilitary bases.4 According to biographer Ronnie Dugger, author of ThePolitician: The Life and Times of Lyndon Johnson,5 much of the money he was paidby Brown & Root came in cash. “It was a totally corrupt relationship and itbenefited both of them enormously,” says Dugger, “Brown & Root got rich, andJohnson got power and riches.” Using the same tactics, the contracts have flowedfrom government ever since. Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles policeofficer, wrote in a study of Brown & Root:> “From Bosnia and Kosovo, to Chechnya, to Rwanda, to Burma, to Pakistan, to> Laos, to Vietnam, to Indonesia, to Iran to Libya to Mexico to Colombia, Brown> & Root’s traditional operations have expanded from heavy construction to> include the provision of logistical support for the US military. Now, instead> of US Army quartermasters, the world is likely to see Brown & Root warehouses> storing and managing everything from uniforms to rations to vehicles.” 6Both Halliburton and Brown & Root were funders of a now infamous company calledPermindex, a British Intelligence front organisation headed by the CanadianLouis M. Bloomfield, which, it is now well documented, was the centralcoordinating network behind the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas(Texas again) in 1963. (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailedbackground.) Permindex also ran death squads in Europe, Mexico, Central America,the Caribbean and the United States. Clay Shaw is the only man to be tried forinvolvement in the assassination, but the New Orleans District Attorney, JimGarrison, failed to secure a conviction because the key prosecution witnesseshad this strange habit of dying from less than natural causes. Shaw, a Britishintelligence operative who worked for Churchill during the Second World War, rana division of Permindex in New Orleans. After the assassination, Halliburtonpurchased Brown & Root. The connections from Permindex involved a stream offamous companies, banks and personalities, including the Bush family and theBronfman gangster family in Canada through its Seagram liquor operation.7Halliburton, at Cheney’s say-so, bought and merged with Dresser Industries in an$8 billion deal in 1998 to create the biggest oil-drilling services company inthe world. George W. Bush’s grandfather Prescott Bush was on the board ofDresser Industries for 22 years in his capacity as a partner in Brown Brothers,Harriman, the funders of Hitler and the eugenics movement, which owned Dresser.The President and Chairman of the Dresser board was Henry Neil Mallon,Prescott’s Skull and Bones buddy, who was among those involved in raiding thegrave of the Apache chief Geronimo at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1918 to steal hisskull and take it back to Skull and Bones headquarters at Yale. It was Mallon,apparently, who burned the flesh and hair off the skull after Bush and friendshad stolen it. Father George’s crooked son, Neil Mallon Bush of SilveradoSavings and Loans fame, was named after the Dresser President, and Father Georgebegan his oil career with the company. There is, researchers suggest, aphotograph that includes Prescott Bush, and George and Barbara Bush holding aninfant George W. in front of the Dresser Industries executive plane.8Snouts in the troughCheney says he stands for small government and against government handouts. Whathe means, naturally, is he believes in that for everyone else, not himself.Halliburton received in five years some $4 billion (at least) in governmentcontracts and loans insured by the taxpayer. The government, through the USExport-Import Bank, also guaranteed credits worth $489 million to a Russian oilcompany to the benefit of Halliburton, through Brown & Root. This company,according to Russian and American sources and documents, is connected to drugtrafficking and organised crime.9 Before Cheney took over at Halliburton, itsbusiness with the US Defense Department was worth around $300 million a year.When Cheney, the former Defense Secretary, arrived their government contractssoared to more than $650 million, according to the Baltimore Sun.10 It’s thesame story with loans and guarantees from the government’s Export-Import Bankand the Overseas Private Investment Corporation: $100 million in the five yearsbefore Cheney, but at least $1.5 billion under his leadership. In return forpolitical support and loan guarantees, Halliburton donated vast sums topolitical candidates and parties after Cheney’s arrival, and the lobbying budgetdoubled: $300,000 a year on lobbying politicians before Cheney and $600,000 withhim at the helm. Halliburton has also benefited from US “aid” to variouscountries, which was then spent by the recipients on hiring Halliburton. The LosAngeles Times obtained State Department documents that showed how governmentofficials helped Halliburton to win major contracts in Asia and Africa.11 Thisis the way the Illuminati families and agents operate. They control thegovernment decisions through the Illuminati one-party state and operatecompanies, like Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, which benefit from thosegovernment decisions and policies. This is how, once Cheney took over,Halliburton was able to expand so rapidly and become the fifth largest defencecontractor in the US, so benefiting enormously from conflicts like the “war onterrorism”. It has a worldwide operation involving 130 countries and isAmerica’s biggest non-union company.12 No wonder Cheney was given a $34 million“retirement package” when he left in the summer of 2000 to be the running mateof Boy George. This was after five years on a salary of $1.3 million a year,plus bonuses of millions more, stock options worth some $45 million,13 and hissale of 100,000 Halliburton shares that netted him $5.1 million.14 The“retirement package” also included 400,000 unvested stock options due to “vest”over three years. This means that the higher the value of Halliburton stock inthis period the more money the Vice President will accrue, and the oil industrydepends very much on government policy. The Baltimore Sun of June 10th 2002reported that Halliburton was being investigated by the Securities and ExchangeCommission for accounting irregularities. An “aggressive accounting practice” atHalliburton approved by the (Enron/Worldcom) accounting firm Arthur Andersen wassaid to be behind the investigation, and involved allegations of counting $100million in revenue that had not yet been received.Working with terroristsCheney’s Halliburton has worked closely with some of the most appallingterrorist dictatorships on the planet. He talks of “constructive engagement” inwhich you work with such regimes and pass on American values. No need. Thevalues of successive US and British governments are a mirror of those employedby these very terrorist dictatorships. For Cheney, this is nothing to do with“values” – he doesn’t have any – it is about working with anyone at any price toensure more money and power, and the advancement of the Illuminati agenda. DickCheney was the Defense Secretary in the Gulf Slaughter supposedly aimed atSaddam Hussein in 1991. Yet he made big profits for himself and Halliburtonafter 1998 through deals with … Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. The London FinancialTimes reported that Cheney oversaw $23.8 million worth of contracts for the saleof “oil industry” technology and services to Iraq. He used Halliburtonsubsidiaries in France, Italy, Germany and Austria to hide theCheney-Halliburton connection. Among these companies were Dresser Rand andIngersoll-Dresser Pump.15 These contracts together were worth more than anyother US company doing business with Iraq. The International Herald Tribunereported that “Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Co., joint ventures thatHalliburton has sold … have done work in Iraq on contracts for thereconstruction of Iraq’s oil industry, under the United Nations’ Oil for FoodProgram.” 16 A Halliburton spokesman admitted in the Tribune article that theDresser subsidiaries had sold oil-pumping equipment to Iraq via their Europeanagents. So get this: staggeringly, these Halliburton group contracts werehelping to rebuild the oil infrastructure of Iraq destroyed by the bombs droppedby United States planes commanded from the Pentagon by the then DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney! At the same time Cheney was supporting sanctions againstIraq that have so far produced around a million dead children. (What happenedthere to “constructive engagement”?)The oil cartel benefits enormously from cheap oil pumped by Iraq in the UnitedNations’ (Illuminati) “oil-for-food programme”. Many Illuminati companies andfront men are benefiting from contracts with Iraq and other brutal dictatorshipswhile supporting sanctions that are killing thousands of Iraqi children everymonth. John Deutsch, the former head of the CIA, is a director of Schlumberger,the second largest US oil services company, which also does business, throughsubsidiaries, with Iraq. Halliburton has struck deals in Iran and Libya, eventhough they were on the State Department’s list of terrorist states. TheHalliburton subsidiary Brown & Root was fined $3.8 million for violation of USsanctions against Libya. Cheney, incidentally, lied on US television (it comesso easy to him) when he was asked during the 2000 presidential campaign on ABC’sThis Week programme about Halliburton’s deals with Iraq while he was in charge.He had this brief exchange with interviewer Sam Donaldson, who then just let thematter drop:> Donaldson: “I’m told, and correct me if I’m wrong, that Halliburton, through> subsidiaries, was actually trying to do business in Iraq?”> Cheney: “No. No. I had a firm policy that I wouldn’t do anything in Iraq –> even arrangements that were supposedly legal.”What’s that they say? Liar, liar, pants on fire? The Gore camp didn’t raise thisexplosive information because they were up to their eyes in corruption too.Anything goesA number of pressure groups have sought to expose the support by Halliburtonunder Cheney’s leadership of the brutal military dictatorship in Burma throughtheir involvement in pipeline construction. Among Halliburton’s partners,according to published reports, has been the British company Alfred McAlpine.Readers of my other books, like The Biggest Secret, will need no introduction tothe McAlpine family. EarthRights, the human rights group based in Washington DC,condemned Cheney’s Halliburton for two pipeline projects in Burma, the buildingof which led to rape, murder, indentured labour, the forced relocation ofvillages and other crimes against humanity.17 The regime in Burma (also known asMyanmar) has been condemned constantly by the U.N. General Assembly, theInternational Labor Organization, Amnesty International, the European Union andthe US government, which withdrew its ambassador and imposed sanctions. Funnilyenough, these sanctions laws specifically exempt the work that Halliburton does.Katie Redford, a human rights lawyer for EarthRights, said: “Halliburtonpartners and subsidiaries, both before and during Dick Cheney’s tenure as CEO,have been contractors for pipeline projects that have led to crimes againsthumanity in Burma.” 18 The International Labor Organization said the junta inBurma is guilty of “an international crime”, possibly “a crime againsthumanity”, through its exploitation of forced child labour. Tens of thousands ofpeople have been abused, murdered and driven from their homelands by the Burmesearmy, thousands have been tortured, and the jails are full of politicalprisoners. The junta is also one of the world’s major producers and traffickersof heroin. All this matters not a jot to Dick Cheney. In fact to him it will beall the more reason to get involved. Also working with the Burmese terrorists onthe oil pipelines has been Unocal (Union Oil of California) – the company thatproposed a pipeline across Afghanistan, but said the Taliban had to go before itcould happen.Cheney sought to overcome any obstacles to his company’s business dealings withone of the world’s most oppressive regimes by using USA-Engage, the lobbyinggroup that opposed investment sanctions against Burma. He was also on the boardof the National Foreign Trade Council that helped to pressure the Supreme Courtto overturn a Massachusetts state law that imposed penalties on companiestrading with Burma. When it suits Cheney’s agenda he is against even financialsanctions against an oppressive terrorist regime. When it suits him another way,he is in favour of blitz bombing the country and killing thousands of civilians,as in Iraq and Afghanistan.19Halliburton has both denied involvement in Burma and said that it has not triedto hide its involvement. Go figure. Wall Street Journal reporter Peter Waldmanpoints out that when Halliburton proclaimed its “success story” in December 1996with a press conference to announce several big contracts in Asia and Europethere was no mention of one of their biggest deals of the year – in Burma.20 Aspokeswoman for Halliburton said she was not able to establish why the companyfailed to mention the Burma contract for its subsidiary, European Marine. Ithink I can help her there. She also declined to explain the massive revenueincrease – some 77% – for European Marine in 1997, the year that most of theBurma work was done. I’m sure I can be of some assistance to her there, too. TheHalliburton contract was mostly for work on the pipeline offshore and thecompany claimed that it had no dealings with the Burmese people or the military.This is simply not true. A 1996 report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Burma,Judge Rajsoomer Lallah of Mauritius, revealed that people were forced to workoffshore as well. He found that in 1995 the military ordered about 200 villagersto go to Heinze Island, an uninhabited shoal in the Andaman Sea where Burmeseforces set up a base camp to guard construction work on the offshore pipeline.Peter Waldman told the story in his Wall Street Journal report:> “On Heinze Island, Judge Lallah found, the villagers were required to work for> two weeks without pay, clearing land, building bamboo barracks and> constructing a helicopter pad high atop a steep hill – probably for later use> by the Western companies that built the pipeline, according to Burmese> human-rights monitors. The villagers were forced to pay their own> transportation costs to the island; those who refused to go were arrested and> sent into rebellious areas to serve as porters for the military, Judge Lallah> wrote.” 21… and there’s moreBurma is only one in a long list of Cheney-Halliburton deals with dubious andterrorist regimes. Human rights activists point to Halliburton’s role inAlgeria, Angola, Bosnia, Croatia, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Rwanda, Somalia, Indonesia,Libya and Nigeria. Halliburton’s partner in Russia, Tyumen Oil, has been accusedof committing massive fraud to gain control of a Siberian oil field. EarthRightsrevealed that a Halliburton contract with Indonesia was cancelled by thegovernment when they investigated those that had been corruptly awarded. Onecorporate watchdog organisation in Indonesia said that Halliburton’s engineeringdivision, Kellogg Brown & Root, was among 59 companies that used “collusive,corruptive and nepotistic practices” with the family of the former presidentSuharto, a vicious and corrupt dictator installed by British and Americanintelligence to serve the interests of the corporate giants owned by theIlluminati.22 That’s why Indonesia is now one of the sweatshop capitals of theworld where people living in abject poverty work a fantastic number of hours aweek for pitiful pay so that big-name clothing and sportswear companies canaccrue staggering profits by making the products there for next to nothing whileselling them for high prices in the West. It’s called “globalisation” and “freetrade”.In Nigeria, Halliburton worked with Shell and Chevron, which were bothimplicated in gross violations of human rights and the environment. (BritishPetroleum, Esso, Du Pont, ERAP, Texaco, and Total also have interests inNigeria.) Cheney’s firm increased its involvement there after the militarydictatorship executed several environmental activists and violently preventedprotests against the oil industry. Halliburton was accused of complicity in theshooting of a protestor by Nigeria’s Mobile Police Unit. In another incident,highlighted by the New York-based pressure group, Human Rights Watch, soldiersusing a Chevron helicopter and Chevron boats attacked villagers in two smallcommunities in Delta State, Opia and Ikenyan. They killed at least four peopleand burned most of the villages to the ground. More than 50 people were stillmissing, Human Rights Watch reported. Chevron, who merged with Texaco a monthafter 9/11, claimed it was a “counterattack” resulting from a confrontationbetween local youths and soldiers at a Chevron drilling rig. Community membersdenied there was any such confrontation. Condoleeza Rice, the current USNational Security Adviser to Bush and Cheney, was a director of Chevron from1991 and she took charge of public policy for the board. She even had a Chevronoil tanker named after her. Rice was involved in negotiating Chevron investmentsin the vast untapped reserves of oil in the Caspian Sea region before leaving tojoin her long-time buddy, George W. Bush. As National Security Adviser she isvery much involved in the “war on terrorism”, which has removed the Talibanregime and opened the way for oil and gas pipelines across Afghanistan. Theseare the very pipelines designed to tap the vast gas and oil reserves around …the Caspian Sea.It’s the oil, stupidBefore we can understand one (of many) reasons for September 11th and the “waron terrorism” we have to understand the plans of the Illuminati with regard tothe fantastic oil and gas reserves of the Caspian Sea region. Cheney’sHalliburton does major business in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Iran, which areall in the same crucial region as Afghanistan (Figure 8).23 Specialists suggestthat the Caspian area might contain the world’s third largest oil and naturalgas reserves after the Gulf region and Siberia, and it has been the number onetarget of the oil cartel and its political representatives since themanufactured break-up of the former Soviet Union aided by Illuminati front man,Mikhail Gorbachev (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret).The San Francisco Chronicle estimated the proven and projected reserves in theregion to be more than 800 billion barrels of crude petroleum and its equivalentin natural gas.24 The combined oil reserves in the Americas and Europe arereckoned to be fewer than 160 billion barrels. The biggest Caspian fields are inKazakhstan and Azerbaijan (both in Halliburton’s portfolio, and Cheney sat onthe state of Kazakhstan’s Oil Advisory Board). Lesser reserves are located inGeorgia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia. The projected value of this,based on average prices in the 1990s, is $5 trillion, a very conservativeestimate. This is the region in which the United States is locating troops inthe name of the “war on terrorism”. The real reason is to secure control of theoil and gas reserves and the pipelines that will take them to market. WilliamRamsay, a US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Energy, Sanctions andCommodities, said that Caspian oil is “crucial to the world energy balance overthe next 25 years.” He also revealed that: “… there already exists a kind ofoutline of a new Silk Road running through the Caucasus and beyond the Caspian.We think oil and gas pipelines, roads, railways and fiber optics can make this21st century Silk Road a superhighway linking Europe and Central Asia.” 25 Themanufactured wars in the Balkans that have caused so much death and suffering,were also engineered, in part, for this same reason – oil from the Caspianregion. Doug Bereuter, Chairman of the US House [of Representatives] SubCommittee on Asia and the Pacific, confirmed that American policy goals in thisregion are the “independence” of the new states and their ties to the West(yeah, right), breaking Russia’s monopoly over oil and gas transport routes,encouraging the construction of East–West pipelines that do not transit Iran,and denying Iran dangerous leverage over the central Asian economies.26Researcher George Draffan wrote in an article on the battle for Caspian oil:image [../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 8: The Caspian Sea region the Illuminati (indeed different factions ofthem) are desperate to control > “The 1995 Dayton Accords led to a major NATO military operation to ‘pacify’> Bosnia-Herzegovina. For the multinational corporations working alongside NATO,> one of the most important rewards will be the construction of a trans-Balkan> pipeline to bring oil from the Caspian Sea region to Europe.> “The European Union, the US government, and a gang of multinational> corporations (including BP, Amoco, Exxon, Unocal, Caterpillar,> Halliburton/Brown & Root, and Mitsubishi) are using all the military,> political, and economic tools at their disposal to destroy and recreate the> infrastructure and economy of south-eastern Europe in their own image.

The current focus is to secure oil> and gas pipeline routes from the oilfields of the Caspian Sea to the consumers> of Europe.

War is so great for business. Condoleezza Rice’sChevronTexaco is leading a Caspian Pipeline Consortium developingCaspian-Kazakhstan oil deposits. Others in the trough are BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobiland Unocal. They are seeking to access these reserves from Azerbaijan,Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, the three countries that surround the Caspiantogether with Russia and Iran. The Russians want a pipeline north from theCaspian into their territory to the Black Sea. Russian military action, claimedby President Putin to be a response to Chechnya and al-Qaeda terrorism, has“coincidentally” taken place near the projected routes of the pipelines. Putinis a “former” KGB operative and head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) andanything he says should be disbelieved by reflex action. When you look at thefrenzy to control and access these oil and gas reserves, the pattern of conflictand terrorism across this whole Middle East and Caspian region starts to makecoordinated sense. Author Michael Griffin wrote in Reaping the Whirlwind28 thatthe Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan can be linked to a “single, goldentheme”, which he identified in places like Chechnya, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhaziaand Turkish Kurdistan:> … “each represented a distinct, tactical move, crucial at the time, in> discerning which power would ultimately become master of the pipelines which,> some time in this century, will transport the oil and gas from the Caspian> basin to an energy-avid world.” 29Different place, same namesThe oil cartel and its political cronies and associates are working together tomaximise their power and profits. One example is the Azerbaijan InternationalOperating Company (AIOC), which is a consortium involving the country’s stateoil company together with Pennzoil (Bush), Unocal, Exxon, British corporationsBP-Amoco and Ramco Khazar, Lukoil (Russia), Den Norske Stats Olieselscap(Norway), Turkie Petrollari (Turkey), Itochu (Japan) and Delta Nimir Khazar(Saudi Arabia). Note that Pennzoil, a major player in the project, was createdwhen Father George Bush’s Zapata Oil took over Penn Oil in 1963. Baker andBotts, the law firm now headed by James Baker, Bush’s Carlyle Group associate,handle Pennzoil’s legal affairs. Thomas Petzinger, a business journalist on theWall Street Journal, would later write: “For 25 years, the internal legaldepartment at Pennzoil had been almost indistinguishable from Baker and Botts.”30 Pennzoil’s partner in the project, Delta Nimir, is controlled by our oldfriends Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi and Khalid bin Mahfouz, both of whom havefinancial ties to “Osama bin Laden’s” al-Qaeda. Bin Mahfouz has funded George W.Bush’s oil company and the Carlyle Group of Father George. Other businesspartnerships involving bin Mahfouz, Al-Amoudi, and leading US oil giants includethe following: the Nimir Petroleum (Mahfouz family) deal with ChevronTexaco todevelop massive oil fields in Kazakhstan that are said to contain up to 1.5billion barrels of oil; the Delta Oil (Al-Amoudi family) partnership withAmerada Hess to develop oil fields in Azerbaijan; and Delta-Hess is part of aconsortium hoping to build a $2.4 billion oil pipeline from Azerbaijan toTurkey.One of the directors of the US and Saudi-dominated Azerbaijan InternationalOperating Company is Brent Scowcroft, a former US National Security Adviser, anexecutive of Kissinger Associates, and a very close associate of Father GeorgeBush. The plans of this consortium involve a thousand-mile pipeline from Baku onthe Caspian across Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on theMediterranean, which was projected to cost $3 billion. Oil is a main reason(along with drugs) for the Turkish and other attacks on the lands of the Kurdsand the massive expansion of the Turkish armed forces. Turkey has alreadymurdered thousands of Kurds, destroyed thousands of villages and producedmillions of refugees. The horrors of September 11th have provided the excuse forboth British and American forces to be dispatched to the very region necessaryto secure control of the Caspian oil reserves and pipeline projects and forenormous increases in spending on “defence” and “security”. As I was writingthis chapter, President Bush announced a $48 billion increase in US defencespending to $379 billion and said he would spend whatever it takes to keep theAmerican people safe. What’s that about there being no money for the poor andhungry? These vast increases have nothing to do with protecting Americans, andeverything to do with protecting and advancing the interests of Bush, those whofund and control him, and the global agenda that he serves.Trading with terrorAzerbaijan, like the other oil-rich or pipeline-significant countries in theCaspian, has an appalling human rights record. Ethnic cleansing of Armenians inNagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region of Azerbaijan, has led to sanctions andrestrictions on US aid to the country. This was made law through section 907 ofthe 1992 Freedom Support Act. Cheney has pressed for the repeal of this sectionto release funds for the oil cartel’s operations in Azerbaijan and has lobbiedconstantly for sanctions to be lifted on Iran and other countries to easethrough the Illuminati oil agenda he represents. He is also among those lobbyingfor the Azerbaijan–Turkey pipeline on behalf of the Azerbaijan InternationalOperating Company. His fellow lobbyists include James Baker, Father George’sSecretary of State, oil company lawyer, and director of the Carlyle Group;Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Adviser to Jimmy Carter and founder ofthe Illuminati’s Trilateral Commission; Lloyd Bentsen, former US Secretary ofthe Treasury; John Sununu, former White House Chief of Staff to George Bush; TimEggar, the former British Energy Minister and now CEO of Britain’s Monument Oil;Malcolm Rifkind, the former British Foreign Secretary and now a director of theBritish oil corporation, Ramco; oh yes, and Richard Secord, the former US AirForce Major General charged for his part in Father George’s Iran-Contra affair,has been helping to train the Azerbaijani army.By 1997, Pennzoil, Unocal, Amoco and Exxon had invested $5 billion in Azerbaijanand, as we have seen so many times, forcibly controlling the population toensure unchallenged control for the oil cartel is a constant strategy. Compliantdictatorships are good for business and I include “democracies” in that also.The Azerbaijan government is now serving the interests of this American andBritish takeover of the Caspian region by selling off ports, railroads, thenational airline, airports and other state-run enterprises to “foreigninvestors”. It is an identical story in the Balkans where the same thing ishappening. Governments are installed after manipulated wars that will sell offmajor state assets to the Illuminati corporations and award contracts to theircompanies for “reconstruction”. Contracts for the Balkan region, are estimatedto be worth £30 billion. Then there is the money (taxpayers money) paid out for“reconstruction” and “aid” by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF), both of which are 100% Illuminati (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free).Most of this money also ends up with the corporations and this is why theprojects funded by this diabolical duo are designed to benefit businessinterests and not local populations. NATO, the world army in all but name, isnothing more than the means for the Illuminati cartels to bully and bomb theirtargets into submission so this process can unfold – that’s the real reason forthe Balkan occupation by foreign troops.This strategy was promoted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the founder of the TrilateralCommission and major Illuminati insider, in his 1997 book The Grand Chessboard.He said that control of Uzbekistan was the key to dominating the region and itsoil and gas reserves. This is why the US has had “military advisers” inUzbekistan for a long time and this “support” has been increased still furtherin the “war on terrorism”. Writing of the need for the United States to dominatethe region, Brzezinski says: “The three grand imperatives of imperialgeostrategy are to prevent collusion and security dependence among the vassals,to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from comingtogether.” 31 I think divide and rule would put it more succinctly. An articleby writer Nicholas Lemann in the New Yorker also revealed that after thecollapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 Dick Cheney formed a group to plan astrategy for the 1990s and beyond.32 This group included the current Secretaryof Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the current Deputy Secretary of Defense PaulWolfowitz, the current Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Lewis “Scooter”Libby, currently Cheney’s chief of staff. The aim was to “shape” the world intheir desired image or, as another member, Zalmay Khalilzad, put it … to“preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future”. Lemannsays he was shown a copy of the document Cheney’s group put together calledDefense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy, Secretary ofDefense, Dick Cheney, January 1993. This was the month that Bill Clinton wasinaugurated, and Cheney and Father Bush left the White House. This “strategy”,planned in the early 1990s, is pretty much what the Bush and Cheney governmentis doing today – a government that includes the key people who put the documenttogether. The “war on terrorism” was a response to September 11th? Ha, ha, ha.Whoop, whoop, whoop. It’s the way they tell ’em.So why Afghanistan?All of this brings me to Afghanistan and the Texas-based oil giant Unocal, oneof the world’s leading independent natural gas and crude oil exploration andproduction companies. It has been a project-partner many times with Cheney’sTexas-based Halliburton. The Burma pipeline is one example of this and as Cheneysaid in his 1998 speech to the “Collateral Damage Conference” presented by theWashington “think tank”, the Cato Institute: “About 70 to 75% of our business isenergy related, serving customers like Unocal, Exxon, Shell, Chevron and manyother major oil companies around the world.” Both Halliburton and Unocal havebusiness and crony connections to the Bush family, as indeed do Chevron, Shell,and Exxon come to that. In October 1997, Unocal led an international consortiumthat beat off competition from the Argentine company, Bridas, to sign a $2billion contract with Turkmenistan for the CentGas project (Central Asia Gas), amassive pipeline that included 750 metres across western Afghanistan. It wouldconnect the vast natural gas reserves of Turkmenistan (possibly the world’sbiggest) to a plant and ports on the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan – yet anothermilitary dictatorship controlled by the “West” (Illuminati). An oil version wasalso planned and extensions into India were being considered. How fascinatingthat in that same month, on October 27th 1997, a press release from Cheney’sHalliburton announced that the company had received a Letter of Intent fromPetronas Carigali (Turkmenistan) to provide integrated drilling services worthan initial $30 million for an exploration and appraisal programme in the CaspianSea beginning in late 1997. It went on: “Halliburton, in conjunction withalliance partners, Dresser Industries and Western Atlas, will provide acombination of 10 services … Halliburton will be the lead contractor and projectmanager in addition to providing technical services. The value of the award isestimated to be US $30 million for the total project.” This no doubt wasHalliburton’s contribution to the Unocal pipeline across Afghanistan (Figure 9).image [../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 9: The approximate route of the pipelines planned across Afghanistan tocarry oil and gas to world markets Taliban we love youTurkmenistan’s dictator President Niyazov said he had a promise of support forthe pipeline from both the ruling Taliban and from anti-Taliban factions inAfghanistan. Turkmenistan’s official negotiator on the pipeline project wasYosef Maiman, a “former” agent with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad,which, at the highest level, is the same organisation as the CIA, Britishintelligence, and so on. The Taliban were keen to go ahead because it would netthem some $100 million a year, but to make the project work Unocal needed the USState Department to formally recognise the Taliban government that had seizedpower with it’s usual extreme violence in 1996 from the factions of theMujahadin that had fought, with CIA support, to remove the Soviet Union from thecountry. The Taliban killed and castrated the former president Najibullah, andhung his body and that of his brother from traffic lights at the entrance to thePresidential Palace. In September 1996, a day after the Taliban took power inKabul, a US State Department spokesman, Glyn Davies, said that the United Statessaw “nothing objectionable” in the Taliban inflicting its strict interpretationof Islamic law. Unocal and partners hired some big names to press the case for adeal with the Taliban. Among them were Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary ofState and one of the major Illuminati manipulators of the past 40 years; RobertOakley, the US Ambassador to Pakistan during the Reagan and Bushadministrations; and the Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, a former adviser onAfghanistan in the Reagan (Bush) State Department. This is the same manappointed by President George W. Bush as Special Envoy to Afghanistan andKhalilzad is a former adviser to Unocal on the pipeline project! The journalistand cartoonist, Ted Rall, says that Khalilzad worked for the ReaganAdministration in arming the CIA-funded Mujahadin during the Soviet occupationof Afghanistan. This was the period when the Osama bin Laden network was formedwith American government money and it eventually led to the coming to power ofthe Taliban. Khalilzad was also part of Dick Cheney’s “strategy group” in theearly 1990s and argued that it was “vital” to prevent a rival to the UnitedStates’ supremacy from emerging and “to be willing to use force if necessary.”33When the Taliban were removed by the “war on terrorism” following 9/11, the headof the new government in Afghanistan was named as Hamid Karzai who, according tothe French publication Le Monde, is a former consultant to … yes … Unocal.34Robert Oakley was also Ambassador to Somalia and Zaire, a head of“counterterrorism” for Reagan and Bush, and one of the US government officialsensuring that CIA funds reached the Afghan resistance groups, including that ofOsama bin Laden, during the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989. Oakleylater worked for Delta-Nimir, the joint operation of the bin Mahfouz andAl-Amoudi families, the funders of Osama bin Laden and associates of the Bushes.Delta-Nimir was a partner of Unocal in the Afghan pipeline project and wasalready a major investor with Unocal in the oil fields of Azerbaijan, as I haveoutlined. At the same time as working for the Unocal consortium, Oakley andKhalilzad were also advising the US State Department.35 Another of those hiredto “advise” and lobby on behalf of the Turkmenistan government in the early1990s was Alexander Haig, the Knights of Malta initiate and formerly aReagan-Bush Secretary of State, commander of NATO forces, and one-time militaryassistant to Henry Kissinger.Unocal gave the Taliban a fax machine to speed communications and funded a jobtraining programme through the University of Nebraska in the Taliban strongholdof Kandahar to train people to work on the pipeline. Unocal flew Talibanofficials to the United States for talks in early December 1997 and spentseveral days at their headquarters in Sugarland, Texas, enjoying star treatment.Sugarland is part of Houston, the home of the Bush family operations. The visitalso included meetings with the State Department in Washington. There was notalk whatsoever about Taliban support for terrorism and Osama bin Laden, and notalk of handing him over. Instead Unocal “offered them a generous cut of theprofits”, according to journalist John Pilger.36 Dick Cheney was in Texas atthis time as head of Halliburton, which stood to gain enormously from theUnocal-Taliban pipeline.Oops, sorry, Taliban we hate youWhat scuppered the Unocal deal, among other things, was the mounting outrageamong women’s groups at the Taliban’s unbelievable abuse of women and theirbasic human rights. American women’s groups began to organise protests againstUnocal and the Feminist Majority Foundation in Los Angeles petitioned theCalifornia State Government to revoke Unocal’s charter in response to theirnegotiations with the Taliban. It became impossible for the Taliban regime to berecognised. Then, in 1998, came the bombings of US Embassies in Kenya andTanzania, which killed 224 people, 12 of them American. Osama bin Laden wasblamed for these outrages and President Clinton ordered the bombing of targetsin Afghanistan and Sudan, two countries said to be protecting him. He also frozebin Laden’s assets (it says here) and banned US firms from doing business withhim. The Bush family must have been out of the country at the time and didn’thear that one. With these developments Unocal’s plans were in ruins and theypulled out of the pipeline deal on December 4th 1998. John J. Maresca, Unocal’sVice President for International Relations, had told the House Committee onInternational Relations that the “Taliban government in Afghanistan is anobstacle” to the pipeline project and that “construction of the pipeline cannotbegin until a recognized government is in place in Kabul that has the confidenceof governments, lenders, and our company.” In the wake of September 11th, thatis exactly what has happened, and the Afghanistan pipeline is now going to bebuilt! This is all just a co-incidence, of course, and nothing to worry about.As the US Government Energy Information fact sheet on Afghanistan said inDecember 2000:> “Afghanistan’s significance from an energy standpoint stems from its> geographic position as a potential transit route for oil and natural gas> exports from Central Asia to the Arabian Sea. This potential includes proposed> multi-billion dollar oil and gas export pipelines through Afghanistan,> although these plans have now been thrown into serious question …”Not, however, for long, it seems, thanks to September 11th and the bombing intooblivion of the Taliban. This invasion was ordered by the Bush administration,including Vice-President Dick Cheney. In May 2002, Mohammad Alim Razim, theMinister for Mines and Industries in the Interim government of “Unocal’s” HamidKarzai, announced plans to build the pipeline and he said that Unocal was the“lead company”.37 The BBC reported that the pipeline was expected to be builtwith “funds from donor countries for the reconstruction of Afghanistan”. Putanother way, the people that made a fortune from the invasion of Afghanistanthrough their arms sales will now have much of the cost of their pipeline met bytaxpayers, er, sorry, “aid to help the poor people of Afghanistan rebuild theircountry”.38 Before this announcement, the BBC had reported how “oil experts” haddismissed the suggestion that the “war on terrorism” in Afghanistan was in anyway about oil. It is so comforting to know that the academics understand what ishappening in the world and thus can pass on their stunning insights to theirstudents. Paul Stevens, Professor of Petroleum Policy and Economics at DundeeUniversity, said: “There was discussion of the pipeline to carry gas toPakistan, but it was abandoned way before current events because of political,economic and stability problems. So the idea that oil is now driving this war istotally unrealistic. It would be more sensible to be considering a pipeline onthe moon.”39 Which is where, on this evidence, Professor Stevens might choose torelocate. It’s made of cheese you know.The drug connection (naturally)Anyone who has done even basic research into the Bush family and their networkof placemen will always look for the drug connection, such is the enormousinvolvement they have with the global drug cartel. So it is with Vice PresidentDick Cheney, the long-time Bush crony and beneficiary. Michael C. Ruppert is aformer officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) who also worked forits Organized Crime Intelligence Division. He now produces an excellentnewsletter called From the Wilderness.40 In his edition of October 24th 2000,headed “Halliburton Corporation’s Brown & Root is one of the major components ofthe Bush-Cheney drug empire”, Ruppert highlights the role played in theBush-Cheney drug network by the Halliburton subsidiary Brown & Root. Thiscompany is fundamentally connected to the US military, the intelligence agenciesand their operations around the world, including Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia,and employs 20,000 people in more than 100 countries. The Kosovo Liberation Army(KLA) was a CIA-backed operation and was used, in part, as the excuse for the USand British-controlled NATO to bomb and invade Serbia and Kosovo in support ofIlluminati drug and oil pipeline interests. According to the Christian ScienceMonitor and Jane’s Intelligence Review, the Kosovo Liberation Army controls 70%of the heroin entering western Europe. At the same time Cheney’s Brown & Rootwas making billions with its US government supply and support contracts in thesame region, as it still does today.41 It is amazing how the location of Brown &Root operations for the government and the drug running by government agenciestend to synchronise again and again, and this was highlighted in a report by theCenter for Public Integrity (CPI)42 which suggests that drug money was involvedin the financial success of Halliburton under Dick Cheney’s leadership between1995 and 2000 and, in particular, through its subsidiary Brown & Root. Thenthere are those “loans” given by US government agencies that paid for Brown &Root contracts abroad. Michael Ruppert writes:> “The loans had been granted by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private> Investment Corporation. According to [CIA operative] Ralph McGehee’s> [publication] ‘CIA Base’ both institutions are heavily infiltrated by the CIA> and routinely provide NOC [non official cover] to its officers. One of those> loans to Russian financial/banking conglomerate, The Alfa Group of Companies,> contained $292 million to pay for Brown and Root’s contract to refurbish a> Siberian oil field owned by the Russian Tyumen Oil Company.> The Alfa Group completed its 51% acquisition of Tyumen Oil in what was> allegedly a rigged bidding process in 1998.

In 1995, sacks of heroin disguised as sugar were stolen from a rail> container leased by Alfa-Echo and sold in the Siberian town of Khabarovsk. A> problem arose when many residents of the town became ‘intoxicated’ or> ‘poisoned’.” 43The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) story also says that the Russian FSB(“FBI”) report stated that within days of this incident, agents from theMinistry of Internal Affairs raided Alfa-Echo (or Eko) buildings to discoverdrugs and other “compromising documentation”, and it was claimed that Alfa Bankhas laundered drug funds from Russian and Colombian drug cartels. The CPIreported that the lead Washington attorney for the Russian Tyumen Oil Companywas James C. Langdon, Jr of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. This is thesame Akin, Gump which, as I highlighted earlier, represents the bin Ladenfinancers Khalid bin Mahfouz and Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, and the Texas-basedHoly Land Foundation for Relief and Development, which had its assets frozen bythe US Treasury pending an investigation into alleged connections to thePalestinian terrorist group Hamas. Bin Mahfouz retained the services of Akin,Gump during the “investigation” into the BCCI.44 The most famous name at Akin,Gump is Vernon Jordan, the associate of Bill Clinton and friend of MonicaLewinsky, and the firm is awash with cronies of the Bush family. The Center forPublic Integrity report highlighting the drug connection to Cheney’s Halliburtonand Brown and Root also says that the Akin, Gump attorney James C. Langdon Jr“helped coordinate a $2.2 million fund raiser for [George W.] Bush … He thenagreed to help recruit 100 lawyers and lobbyists in the capital to raise $25,000each for W’s campaign.” What a web.A personal storyMichael Ruppert also tells of his own experience with the government, Brown &Root, and drugs in 1977 while he was with the Los Angeles Police Department. Hesaid he travelled to New Orleans in June of that year to try to salvage hisrelationship with Nordica Theodora D’Orsay, or “Teddy”, a CIA contract agent,who had suddenly disappeared. She had wanted him to participate in heroperations from within the Los Angeles Police, but he said: “I had refused toget involved with drugs in any way and everything she mentioned seemed toinvolve either heroin or cocaine along with guns that she was always moving outof the country.” 45 The Director of the CIA at this time was … Father GeorgeBush. Ruppert said he knew that Teddy’s “work” involved the CIA, Los AngelesPolice Department, the royal family of Iran, the Mafia and drugs. Ruppert sayshe found Teddy living in an apartment in Greta, New Orleans, equipped with“scrambler phones, night vision devices and working from sealed communiquésdelivered by naval and air force personnel from nearby Belle Chasse Naval AirStation”. Teddy, he writes, was involved in “something truly ugly” – arrangingfor large quantities of weapons to be loaded onto ships for Iran and workingwith associates of New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello to coordinate the boatservice delivering major shipments of heroin to the city. The boats arrived atMarcello-controlled docks, he says, “unmolested by even the New Orleans policeshe introduced me to, along with divers, military men, former Green Berets andCIA personnel”. He continues:> “The service boats were retrieving the heroin from oil rigs in the Gulf of> Mexico, oil rigs in international waters, oil rigs built and serviced by Brown> and Root. The guns that Teddy monitored, apparently Vietnam era surplus AK 47s> and M16s, were being loaded onto ships also owned or leased by Brown and Root.> And more than once during the eight days I spent in New Orleans I met and ate> at restaurants with Brown and Root employees who were boarding those ships and> leaving for Iran within days. Once, while leaving a bar and apparently having> asked the wrong question, I was shot at in an attempt to scare me off.” 46Disgusted with what he saw, Ruppert says he returned to California and reportedall he had seen, including the Brown & Root connection, to the Los AngelesPolice Department. As a result, he says, he was forced to leave the LAPD at theend of 1978 under threat of death. He says he complained to the LAPD’s InternalAffairs Division and to the LA office of the FBI under the command of TedGunderson, a man who has become part of the “conspiracy exposure” movement inmore recent times. Ruppert says he and his attorney wrote to the politicians,the Department of Justice, the CIA, and contacted the Los Angeles Times. The FBIand the Los Angeles Police Department claimed he was crazy. Where have I heardthat before? In 1981 a two-part news story in the Los Angeles Herald Examinerrevealed that the FBI had taken “Teddy” into custody, but released her with nofurther action. Aaron Cohen, a former New Orleans Crime Commissioner, told thepaper that after 30 years of studying Louisiana’s organized crime operations hefound Ruppert’s description of events to be “perfectly plausible”.47 Ruppertsays that, to this day, a CIA report prepared as a result of his complaintremains classified and exempt from release “pursuant to Executive Order of thePresident in the interests of national security and because it would reveal theidentities of CIA agents”. His written testimony to the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence, dated October 1st 1997, can be found at http://www.copvcia.com[http://www.copvcia.com]http://www.copvcia.com/ssci.htm[http://www.copvcia.com/ssci.htm]. He says that on October 26th 1981 he reportedwhat he saw in New Orleans to his friend and University of California classmate,Craig Fuller, in the basement of the West Wing of the White House. (Fullerbecame Chief of Staff to Vice President Father George Bush from 1981 to 1985.)Ruppert says he later learned more of the background to what he witnessed in NewOrleans:> “In 1982, then UCLA [University of California] political science professor> Paul Jabber filled in many of the pieces in my quest to understand what I had> seen in New Orleans. He was qualified to do so because he had served as a CIA> and State Department consultant to the Carter administration. Paul explained> that, after a 1975 treaty between the Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein, the> Shah had cut off all overt military support for Kurdish rebels fighting Saddam> from the north of Iraq. In exchange, the Shah had gained access to the Shat> al-Arab waterway so that he could multiply his oil exports and income. Not> wanting to lose a long-term valuable asset in the Kurds, the CIA had then used> Brown and Root, which operated in both countries and maintained port> facilities in the Persian Gulf and near Shat al-Arab, to rearm the Kurds. The> whole operation had been financed with heroin. Paul was matter-of-fact about> it. In 1983 Paul Jabber left UCLA to become a Vice President of Banker’s Trust> and Chairman of the Middle East Department of the Council on Foreign> Relations.” 48What Michael Ruppert says fits with my own full-time research since 1991, whichhas listed endless examples of what he describes all over the world asIlluminati governments, corporations and organised crime inter-connect. Ruppertsuggests that …“the relationships between key institutions, players and theBushes themselves suggest that under a George “W” administration the Bush familyand its allies may well be able, using Brown & Root as the operationalinterface, to control the drug trade all the way from Medellin to Moscow”. Brown& Root, the company ultimately controlled by Vice President Dick Cheney from1995 to 2000, had no presence in Colombia apparently until 1997 when it suddenlybegan to acquire nearly a million square feet of warehouse space. “Watch thatspace” would seem to be the best advice going on past experience. What do theyknow about Colombia that the public do not? One of the most obvious Bush-USGovernment drug operations was the already discussed Iran-Contra period in the1980s in which Oliver North was a major figure. Cathy O’Brien tells inTrance-Formation of America of attending drugs parties in which the drug-runningNorth was among the guests.49 Cheney was a vehement defender of North’sIran-Contra activities while serving on the House Intelligence Committee, andsupported his election campaign for a Senate seat in Virginia in 1994.Fortunately North didn’t make it.So there you have some of the appalling background to Dick Cheney who, withFather George, is the immediate power behind the throne, or high chair, ofPresident Bush. It would not surprise me in the least if Boy George wasassassinated in a staged “terrorist attack” to dramatically increase theproblem-reaction-solution possibilities of the “war on terrorism”. After all,his code-name in the Skull and Bones Society was “Temporary” and if Bush were togo, who would be president?

It is almost impossible to exaggerate what isreally going on behind the “movie screen” and it is vital to understand this ifwe are going to see September 11th in its true context. Before I focusspecifically on the events of that day and their aftermath I will brieflysummarise some essential information about the other famous names that have soldus the lie about 9/11 and used it to justify the “war on terrorism”. Used car,anyone?Colin Powell and Richard ArmitageI put these two together because they are so close to each other and they nowhead the US State Department in the “war against sanity”. George W. Bush namedPowell as his Secretary of State and Powell chose Armitage as his deputy. ColinLuther Powell is seen by most Americans as some kind of “war hero”, a man youcan trust. In fact, like those around him in the Bush administration, he is aterrorist under any accepted definition of the word. Colin Powell moralisingabout the need to “stop terrorism” is like Bill Clinton delivering a lecture oncelibacy. The Bush family has sponsored his career and he was Chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, the military head of U.S forces, when Father George andDick Cheney launched the Gulf War in 1991. It was obvious that when the Bushes,Cheney and Powell got together again at the start of 2001, with Boy George asthe voice of his father, that the United States would find itself in anotherwar. I wrote on my website davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com] on Bush’sinauguration day, January 20th 2001:> “Powell, like the Bushes and Cheney, is bloodline and that’s why he is to be> the new Secretary of State. Given that line-up and their mentality and agenda,> don’t be at all surprised if the United States finds itself in another> manipulated war during this administration. You will see “monsters” being> created in the public mind to justify such action.”It took only months.The rise and rise of Colin PowellFather George appointed Powell as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USDepartment of Defense, in 1989. At 52, Powell became the youngest head of theJoint Chiefs and the first African-American. In this position he would serve theBush Illuminati agenda in the manufactured “wars” not only in Iraq, but also inPanama, Somalia and elsewhere. Many researchers have demolished the Powell mythand some are detailed in the sources at the end of this chapter.1 They haveexposed his long record of breaking international human rights legislation – andworse – in the Iran-Contra scandal, the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panamain 1989, the Gulf War, and others. His confidants and sponsors say it all,really. Apart from Father George, these include Casper Weinberger and Frank C.Carlucci, both former Secretaries of Defense; Richard L. Armitage; Vernon E.Jordan, Jr; and Dick Cheney.2 Weinberger was charged over Iran-Contra, but waspardoned by George Bush in the last days of his presidency; Carlucci is a formernumber two at the CIA and now chairman of the Bush-and Baker-dominated CarlyleGroup; Dick Cheney speaks for itself; Vernon E. Jordan is the friend of BillClinton and Monica Lewinsky and a lawyer with Akin, Gump, et al, whichrepresents the Osama bin Laden backers and Bush family business associates,Khalid bin Mahfouz and Mohammad Hussein al-Amoudi. Jordan is a serious insiderwith more than 50 honorary doctorates at U.S universities including Yale andHarvard, and is connected to a stream of Illuminati organisations like theBilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations,Joint Center for Political Studies, Brookings Institution, Ford Foundation,American Express, Bankers Trust, and Dow Jones. Powell described RichardArmitage in his book, My American Journey,3 as “my brother and my bodyguard”.According to a Los Angeles Times article by John Broder: “Some of Powell’sadvice comes from others through Armitage, thus insulating Powell from directlyconsulting people who might then be identified as his ‘advisers’.” In short,Powell and Armitage are real close.The other drug-running “Dick”Interesting, then, that Armitage is another Bush family clone and confidant whoserved under Father George and Ronald Reagan, and has been widely implicated insome deeply unpleasant activities. Armitage has been accused by many sources ofinvolvement in drug running, hit squads, and CIA dirty tricks on behalf of USadministrations (the Illuminati). James ‘Bo’ Gritz, a former Operations Colonelin the Green Berets, says he investigated claims that US prisoners of war fromVietnam were still being held many years after the end of the conflict when theyshould have long been released. In his 1991 book, Called To Serve, and anaccompanying video,4 Gritz named Richard Armitage, Powell’s close friend anddeputy Secretary of State in today’s “war on terrorism”, as a major middlemanbetween the US government and General Khun Sa, then the leading “warlord”operating in the Golden Triangle of the international opium trade. Gritz wrote:> “If Richard Armitage was, as Khun Sa avowed, a major participant in parallel> government drug trafficking, then it explained why our efforts to rescue POWs> had been inexplicably foiled, time after time … If it was true, Richard> Armitage would be the last man in the world who would desire to see prisoners> of war come home alive.” 5Gritz said that Khun Sa told him the United States government had purchased allof the opium supply for 1989 – some 900 tons. When Gritz returned to Burma fivemonths later, Khun Sa agreed to be interviewed on video and name the names ofthe US government agents he worked with, although he said the names were oldones and not the current operatives. He said the government official in chargeof buying the opium crop was Richard Armitage and that he was working with thenotorious Mafia boss in Florida, Santos Trafficante. Khun Sa said he was paid$300,000 a ton for the opium while officials of the US government were sellingit on the streets of America and elsewhere for $1 million a ton. This is a majorway that the Illuminati fund their covert projects without using traceablesources. Gritz approached President Father George Bush to reveal what he haddiscovered, but Bush didn’t want to know for a simple reason – he was heavilyinvolved himself. These claims of involvement in drug running and armstrafficking by Armitage have reportedly been supported by staff at the USEmbassy in Bangkok and his appointment was ended by the United States Ambassadorto Thailand at the time, Morton Abramowitz. Among those who have exposed thegruesome activities of Armitage is the excellent researcher and writer, DavidGuyatt, and you can read his comprehensive article about Bush, Armitage, and theCIA-sponsored cocaine and heroin network in South-East Asia on his website.6Guyatt writes:> “Behind the scenes, a virtual war was in progress as the department of Justice> and the FBI fought to indict Armitage for his narcotics and other criminal> activities. Attorney General Thornburg, a political appointee of President> Bush, powerfully resisted these measures. Significantly, however, Armitage was> also under scrutiny by Federal Investigators working for the President’s> Commission on Organized Crime, with a focus on foreign organized criminal> activity in gambling and drug trafficking.> “Meanwhile, yet another investigator who believed Armitage was ‘dirty’ was> frustrated in his investigations by Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense> [now chairman of the Carlyle Group], and other powerful patrons. In 1975> during Armitage’s CIA tour in Vietnam, Carlucci was number two at the CIA.> Because of the numerous high level obstructions, investigations into> Armitage’s criminal activities were curtailed, but not before some damaging> information had been gathered … Such was the strength of the information> developed on Armitage that he was forced to abandon his nomination for> Secretary of the Army, and, in fact, all other official US government posts.> Subsequently, Defense officials stated privately that Armitage would never> again be permitted to darken the doors of the Department of Defense. [Instead> he darkens the doors of Colin Powell’s State Department.]> “Known as ‘Mr Phu’ (literally meaning ‘Mr Rich’) amongst the Vietnamese> community, Armitage, despite his disgrace, was still able to count on the> enormous power of his political patrons and avoided criminal prosecution.> Knowing far too much about US government ‘dirt’ during the previous three> decades provided him with an instant ‘do not go to jail’ card.” 7Armitage withdrew from his nomination by Father George to be Secretary of theArmy in 1989 because he would have faced a confirmation hearing amid reportsthat organisations representing US war veterans were preparing to oppose him inthe light of his activities in South-East Asia. Armitage has also been linked,along with characters like Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines, to ProjectPhoenix, the CIA mass-murder unit in South-East Asia that I mentioned earlier.Former CIA officer Ralph McGehee, who has since tried to tell some truth aboutthe agency, says that between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix, or Phuong Hoang,Operation rounded up hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and them turned over tothe Vietnamese police for “questioning” (brutal torture).8 Tens of thousands (atleast) were murdered through Project Phoenix, most of them perfectly innocentcivilians. By late 1975, Armitage is reported to have been working out ofBangkok and reports suggest that in the period 1976 to 1979 he was involved withShackley, Clines and Iran-Contra operative Richard Secord, in setting up anumber of corporations and subsidiaries around the world including LakeResources, Stanford Technology Trading Group, Companie de Services Fiduciaria,CSF Investments and Udall Research Corporation. During this time, Secord was inIran coordinating the sale of US military aircraft and weapons to Middle Easterncountries.9Oil, drugs and the upper reaches of politics constantly go together. AfterArmitage did not become Secretary of the Army, Father Bush made him a personalenvoy holding the rank of Ambassador and under this guise Armitage went to theformer Soviet Union to assist it with its “economic development” in 1989. Thiswas just as the race for control of the Caspian oil and gas fields was reallygetting under way after the “fall” of Soviet Communism and new drug routes werebeing organised, which include Azerbaijan. Interestingly, Armitage is a memberof the United States Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce along with … Dick Cheney.They are also both members of the Illuminati “think tank”, the Aspen Institute,which is mentioned in some of my other books. Armitage is reported to havevisited Burma in 1997 on a trip sponsored by the Burma/Myanmar Forum, a group inWashington DC that enjoys major sponsorship from Unocal.10 This is the sameRichard Armitage who is now Deputy Secretary of State to his extremely closefriend, Colin Powell; the same Armitage who tells the world who is responsiblefor September 11th and who should be bombed and murdered in response. Armitageknows the Afghanistan region well. He was an American “adviser” during the warbetween the Afghanistan Mujahadin and the Soviet Union when Osama bin Laden’snetwork was funded and armed into existence by the CIA. Armitage and Powellapparently first met in 1981 and a Powell profile in USA Weekend in 199311 saidthat after Powell became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush, heand Armitage … “started to call each other daily to share information and bounceideas off each other … They have become sounding boards for just about anythingthe other guy wants to discuss. Often they talk, if only briefly, two or threetimes a day.” Newsweek reported that Armitage “may be Powell’s closest friend”.Frankie’s everywhereThe guy who protected Armitage from prosecution for crimes against humanity inboth South-East Asia and on the streets of the United States was Frank C.Carlucci III, the former Assistant Director of the CIA during the Jimmy Carterpresidency and both Secretary of Defense and National Security Adviser to RonaldReagan (i.e. George Bush). He is now chairman of the Carlyle Group. Colin Powellhas referred to Carlucci many times as his “mentor”!!! This does not surprise mea bit given Carlucci’s background and the desperate company that Powell choosesto keep. Karl Evanzz says in his book, The Judas Factor: The Plot to KillMalcolm X,12 that Carlucci’s appointment as Consul and Second-Secretary of theUS Embassy in Stanleyville, the Congo, was a cover for a CIA operation thatincluded the plot to assassinate the recently elected President Patrice Lumumbain 1961. Five months after Lumumba was assassinated, Carlucci was arrested,expelled from the Congo, and returned to the US. He was expelled from Tanzaniain 1965 after he was implicated in the CIA assassination of the Burundi PrimeMinister Pierre Ngendandumwe. Carlucci would later be appointed to majorpositions, including Secretary of Defense, by Bush and Reagan because, clearly,he was just the sort of character they needed for their agenda. This is the manthat Colin Powell calls his “mentor” while lecturing the world on the outragesand dangers of terrorism!Colin Powell, this is your lifeWith a line-up of characters like these supporting Colin Powell it is clear thathe is bloodline and that he would, by definition, have an interesting “history”.Colin Powell was born in 1937 into a family of Jamaican immigrants and wasbrought up in the South Bronx area of New York City. He decided to make the Armyhis career and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1958. It was Colin Powell who“investigated” the infamous My Lai Massacre. This was when members of the USArmy’s Americal Division entered the hamlet of My Lai 4 in South Vietnam onMarch 16th 1968, tortured and murdered hundreds of civilians, and rapedcountless women and young girls. The horror was reported by Tom Glen, a soldierwho told of his own involvement at My Lai in a letter to General CreightonAbrams, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, but his claims were dismissed andcovered up. Major Colin Powell, the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff forOperations, G-3, at Americal Division headquarters, was ordered to investigatethe claims and “report within three days with a suggested reply to Glen”,according to an article in The New Republic.13 Powell’s report decided thatGlen’s story was not true except, possibly, for “isolated instances”. He added:“In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations betweenAmerical soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.” The New Republicarticle concluded that a proper investigation of the charges made by Tom Glenmay have led to a legitimate inquiry into the My Lai Massacre and into othersthat “included a company that had gone along with Tom Glen’s on March 16th 1968and committed a separate massacre of ninety people at My Khe, for which no onewas ever punished”. However, Powell did not choose to investigate the My Laimassacre and it was only later when a second soldier, Ron Ridenhour, gavedetails to a congressman that the army was forced to investigate publicly andPowell’s original “investigation” was shown to be a sham and a cover-up of theatrocities against Vietnamese civilians. But Powell, who knows how to fall in abog and come out clean, even managed to secure a Legion of Merit citation duringthe Ridenhour investigation. Clearly from early in his military career, ColinPowell’s desire to see justice done and terrorism punished would not appear tobe his guiding light.When he returned to the United States, Powell’s career began to progress rapidlyunder the Illuminati sponsorship of characters like Weinberger and Carlucci. Heattended George Washington University and thanks to his powerful backers heprogressed through the hierarchy at the Pentagon. He became National SecurityAdviser in 1987 to Reagan-Bush, a post previously held by people like HenryKissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who are both extremely significant players inthe Illuminati web (See And The Truth Shall Set You Free). National SecurityAdviser, like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State, is amajor Illuminati appointment and Powell has been all three. While he was SeniorMilitary Assistant to Secretary of Defense Weinberger during the Reagan years,he played a major role in operations like the invasion of Grenada and the USbombing (based on false “evidence”) of Libya. It was also during this periodwith Weinberger that Powell was implicated in the Iran-Contra affair in whichWeinberger was fundamentally involved. Weinberger kept details of the illegaltransfer of arms to Iran in a personal diary that he compiled at meetings of theNational Security Council. Yet Powell supported Weinberger in denying theexistence of the diary before later having to admit the claims were true. Powelltold the Iran-Contra investigation under oath:> “The Secretary, to my knowledge, did not keep a diary. Whatever notes he kept,> I don’t know how he uses them or what he does with them. He does not have a> diary …”But in a later sworn statement, he said:> “During the period I worked with Secretary Weinberger … I observed on his desk> a small pad of white paper … I viewed it as his personal diary … Knowing> Secretary Weinberger as I did and knowing the routine way he would jot down> notes on these pads … I considered them a private diary.”Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Powell’s testimony was “at leastmisleading”, but “did not warrant prosecution.” Funnily enough, the Iran-ContraSpecial Counsel’s report said virtually the same about Powell’s best buddy,Richard Armitage: “Independent Counsel declined to prosecute Armitage becausethe OIC’s limited resources were focused on the case against Weinberger andbecause the evidence against Armitage, while substantial, did not reach thethreshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” From the National SecurityArchive comes this account of Powell’s involvement:> “Weinberger testified before the [Senate Select] Committee [on Intelligence]> that later that day he received a call from Poindexter informing him of the> President’s action [to send weapons to Iran]. Weinberger … instructed military> aide, Major General Colin Powell, to arrange the transfer of the weapons … to> the CIA, and that the matter was to be closely held at the direction of the> President. General Powell had had previous discussions with North about the> program and about Israel’s problems in getting replacement TOW’s [missiles] …> According to Armitage and a CIA official, Powell worked with Major General> Vincent Russo of the Defense Logistics Agency to provide the material securely> and without any loss of funds for the Army.” 14Powell’s best buddy Richard Armitage was also involved with Oliver North.According to North’s book, Under Fire,15 they served together on a secret CIA“anti-terrorism unit” that North chaired. Powell, as National Security Adviserto Reagan, threatened to stop all US aid to South American countries that wouldnot support the Contra terrorist war in Nicaragua and he would have been furtherdrawn into the investigative web of Iran-Contra had George Bush not outrageouslypardoned Powell’s boss, Casper Weinberger and others involved in the scandal inthe closing days of his presidency. Powell would have been very relieved. Hiscareer has included leading US forces in George Bush’s drug-related invasion ofManuel Noriega’s Panama in 1989 after he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff. Thousands of Panamanian civilians were killed and whole areas of civilianhomes were destroyed. This was covered up by controlling where the media couldgo, incinerating bodies and dumping corpses in mass graves before they wereidentified, and taking control of all registration by taking over hospitals andmortuaries. Two years later, Powell led US forces in the Gulf War in which atleast 200,000 Iraqis died, according to a speech at Bohemian Grove shortly afterthe conflict by John Lehman, Reagan’s first Navy Secretary. Under Powell’sleadership in Iraq, civilian areas were targeted, conscripts were buried alivein their trenches by bulldozers, more than 40 tons of radioactive material wasscattered across the desert by bombs using depleted uranium, oil refineries wereset on fire, and thousands of civilians, prisoners and retreating Iraqi soldierswere coldly and systematically murdered on the infamous “Highway of Death”.This, and so much more, under the leadership of “war hero” Colin Powell, thefriend of so many deeply disturbed people, and now the US Secretary of Statehelping to dictate the “war on terrorism”. Powell claims he never once receivedan illegal order during his military career (utter claptrap) and yet the actionsof his troops in those Iraqi massacres alone should have prompted chargesrelating to war crimes. Colin Powell’s record of serving the Illuminatiinterests – and taking the rewards – with invasions and massacres of poor anddefenceless peoples in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Haiti and elsewhere is grotesque,and this is the man, like the Bushes, Cheney and the rest of them, who ismoralising about freedom and justice while systematically destroying boththroughout the world.Apart from sending others to the battlefield and orchestrating the slaughter ofthe innocent, Powell has also had a career in business. He has served on theboards of America Online (AOL) and Gulfstream Aerospace, which makes planes forgovernments like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and for Hollywood movies stars. Thecurrent Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, also served on Gulfstream’s boardand had stock worth $11 million when US defence contractor, General Dynamics in1999, bought the company. I don’t know what Powell made from the deal, but he isreported to have earned $4 million in increased stock value when AOL merged withthat Illuminati front, TimeWarner. His son, Michael K. Powell, was the onlycommissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) who said the mergerdeal should be allowed to go through without scrutiny. He denied any conflict ofinterest with his father’s shareholding in AOL at the time, which was worth some$13 million according to newspaper reports. The FCC calls itself an“independent” United States government agency (I love it), which regulates“interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire,satellite and cable”… [in the] … “50 states, the District of Columbia, and USpossessions”.16 In fact, Michael K. Powell, a 1999 Henry Crown Fellow of the(Illuminati) Aspen Institute, does not appear to be in favour of much regulationof media corporations, an attitude that suits the gang perfectly. Two days afterhis inauguration in January 2001, President George W. Bush appointed a newchairman of the FCC … Michael K. Powell. The man he replaced, William Kennard,now works for the Carlyle Group.Donald Rumsfeld – Mr AspartameBush’s Defense Secretary in the “war on terrorism” is Donald Rumsfeld, along-time insider with an impeccable record of service to the global agenda.After attending Princeton University and serving in the Navy, he began hiscareer in Washington DC as an administrative assistant. He was elected toCongress from his home state of Illinois in 1962 and joined the Richard Nixonadministration (controlled by Illuminati Secretary of State Henry Kissinger) in1969. Rumsfeld was a member of the Nixon cabinet from 1971 to 1972 – the year ofthe Watergate break-in, the sting on Nixon orchestrated by Kissinger (see AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free). In 1973 as the Watergate storm unfolded, Rumsfeldwent to Europe as US Ambassador to NATO before returning the following year whenNixon had been ousted. He became chairman of the transition to the presidency ofthe unelected, Watergate-imposed Gerald Ford and his Vice President NelsonRockefeller. Rumsfeld joined the Ford cabinet as Chief of Staff at the WhiteHouse (which means he must have been very acceptable to Kissinger) and he becameUS Secretary of Defense for the first time between 1975 and 1977.Rumsfeld moved into private business after that while maintaining a closeinvolvement in politics. During his time as Chairman and Chief Executive of G DSearle, the pharmaceutical company now owned by the appalling Monsanto, he wasgiven a stream of appointments in and by government. These were: member of thePresident’s General Advisory Committee on Arms Control – Reagan Administration(1982 – 1986); Reagan’s Special Envoy on the Law of the Sea Treaty (1982 –1983); senior adviser to Reagan’s Panel on Strategic Systems (1983 – 1984);member of the US Joint Advisory Commission on US/Japan Relations – ReaganAdministration (1983 – 1984); President Reagan’s Special Envoy to the MiddleEast (1983 – 1984); member of the National Commission on the Public Service(1987 – 1990); member of the National Economic Commission (1988 – 1989); memberof the Board of Visitors of the National Defense University (1988 – 1992);member of the Commission on US/Japan Relations (1989 – 1991); FederalCommunications Commission High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992 –1993); chairman, Commission on the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States(1998 – 1999); member of the US Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999 – 2000);and chairman of the US Commission to Assess National Security Space Managementand Organization (2000).17How helpful all these government connections proved when as head of G D Searle,he used his Washington insider contacts to ensure that the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) gave the go-ahead to market the infamous artificialsweetener, aspartame. Rumsfeld was to Searle what Cheney was (is) toHalliburton. (I describe the manipulation of the FDA decision in Children Of TheMatrix.) Aspartame consists of two synthetic amino acids, phenylalanine (50%)and aspartic acid (40 %) bound in methanol (10%). FDA documents released underthe Freedom of Information Act in 1995 reveal that the consequences of thishorrendous substance include blindness and death. Others, according toscientists, are brain tumours, brain lesions, headaches, mood swings, skinpolyps, insomnia, depression, suppression of intelligence and effects onshort-term memory. Investigative author and food specialist Carol Guilford callsaspartame a “molecular holocaust”.18 This is the mind suppressant (sorry“sweetener”) for which Donald Rumsfeld was hired by Searle in 1977 to wingovernment approval. In January 1981, with the Rumsfeld’s friends in power underBush and Reagan, he told a sales meeting, according to one attendee, that hewould “call in his markers” and get aspartame approved by the end of the year.Immediately the then commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration had hisauthority suspended and the job was given to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes, a professorand contract researcher for the Defense Department. His first major decision wasto approve the use of aspartame in dry foods and his last, in 1983, was toapprove it for soft drinks. This was despite all the evidence of itsconsequences and the opposition of his own board of inquiry. Hayes then left theFDA to become a senior adviser to the public relations firm of … Rumsfeld’s G DSearle. Rumsfeld earned millions for manipulating a truly horrible substanceinto widespread use and he picked up a $12 million bonus when Searle was boughtby the Nazi-connected Monsanto, the promoter of genetically modified (GM) food.Orrin Hatch, the Mormon senator from Utah, also took money from Searle forpressing their case on aspartame, and he worked to suppress independent studiesinto its safety. Hatch was also the man who promoted the BCCI and saidimmediately after 9/11 that the authorities believed that Osama bin Laden couldbe responsible. The Food and Drug Administration in America, like its equivalentin other countries, is an Illuminati front to block products that are good forhumanity and to push through, without proper testing, those that suit theagenda. This happened with aspartame thanks to Rumsfeld. First, the FDA approvedits use on the basis of ridiculous data and then had to withdraw that permissionin the face of studies showing that it caused seizures and brain tumours inanimals. But the FDA restored approval in 1981 thanks to Dr Arthur Hull Hayes,despite the unanimous opposition of a Public Board of Inquiry, which hadreviewed the scientific data and recommended a delay. Dr Ralph G. Walton, aProfessor of Psychiatry at North Eastern Ohio University College of Medicine,reviewed all the studies on aspartame and found 166 with relevance for humansafety. All of the 74 studies funded by the aspartame industry gave it theall-clear, but 92% of those independently funded revealed safety problems. Whichones would you believe?The reason this poison was approved against all the evidence is simplecorruption. A commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, an actingcommissioner, six other operatives, and two attorneys assigned to prosecuteNutraSweet for submitting fraudulent tests, left the organisation to work for …NutraSweet, a trade name for aspartame. One genuine scientist working for theFDA wrote to a US senator: “It’s like a script for Abbott and Costello. It workslike this: ‘approve our poison, and when you stop being a bureaucrat we’ll makeyou a plutocrat! After it’s licensed we’ll pay off the American Dietetics, theAmerican Diabetes Association, the American Medical Association and anyone weneed who’s for sale’.” The man orchestrating all this was Donald Rumsfeld, nowUS “Defense” Secretary in the “war on terrorism”. Clearly a man you can trust.By the way, the Monsanto Corporation of St Louis, Missouri, expanded theaccredited uses for aspartame after taking over Rumsfeld’s G D Searle in 1985.Monsanto is an Illuminati company to its fingertips and the promoter ofgenetically modified food, another part of the Illuminati assault on the humanmind and body. It is using the same methods to win approval for geneticallymodified food as it did for aspartame. The current Bush administration is awashwith people connected to Monsanto.A few other “characters”John Ashcroft, George W. Bush’s Attorney General, is one of the Monsanto fundedinsiders in Boy George’s US government. Ashcroft is another with his snout inthe corporate trough with Microsoft and Enron among his benefactors. When theEnron scandal broke, with President Bush’s biggest funder collapsing amiddocument shredding and fantastic corruption, we had the farcical situation inwhich Attorney General Ashcroft could not take part in the subsequentinvestigation because he had taken money from them! In the November 2000election for the Senate, Ashcroft failed even to beat a dead man. His opponent,the Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, died in a plane crash with his son andcampaign adviser while flying in a Cessna to a campaign rally. Carnahan’s namestayed on the ballot paper and more people voted for him than Ashcroft. It wasthe first time anyone had posthumously won election to the Senate. He couldn’tdo any worse than the live ones, that’s for sure. Ashcroft was soon back inWashington, however, when the incoming President Bush named him as US AttorneyGeneral. This is the man who has been dismantling basic human freedoms in theUnited States since September 11th with an enthusiasm and glee that can only bedescribed as orgasmic. He was appointed by Boy George to replace the deeplycorrupt Janet Reno, she of Waco mass murder fame. Attorney General is anotherbig Illuminati-nominated post. Ashcroft is a member of the “Religious Right”that has spawned Bush family clones like the monumental hypocrite Pat Robertson(see Children Of The Matrix) who has used his “ministry” and massive publicdonations to his “humanitarian projects” to expand his business empire in placeslike the Congo when it was ruled by his friend, the vicious and corruptdictator, Mobuto Sese-Seko. Show me a member of the “Religious Right” and I’llshow you a hypocrite, or, at least, it has never failed yet. Anyway, this is the“spiritual” home of John Ashcroft, the freedom-destroying Attorney General, whohas seized on the deaths of thousands in New York and Washington to cast asidebasic human freedoms.Ashcroft describes himself as a Christian conservative who doesn’t smoke, drinkor dance. He is against abortion because it takes a human life created by God,and yet supports the death penalty and the murder of men, women, and children,in their thousands every month in Iraq, and mass murder in many other parts ofthe world like Afghanistan. Ashcroft’s claim to fame before he became anofficial freedom-buster for the Bush administration was his “war on drugs” andaddictive substances (like the many Father George Bush headed while runningdrugs himself). Ashcroft demands the death penalty for such offences. Bad news,eh, Georgie? At the same time Ashcroft has taken $44,500 from liquor companiessince 1993, including $20,000 from the St Louis-based Anheuser-Busch. He hasalso been lauded by the booze industry in a video tribute produced by the BeerInstitute of America. When Mother Jones magazine questioned this contradiction,Ashcroft said: “It is a product that it is in demand [yes, like drugs] and whenit’s used responsibly it’s like other products.” Ashcroft also accepted moneyfrom the tobacco industry for his 1994 Senate race and said of tobacco thatpeople should be free to make bad choices. Unless Ashcroft decides otherwise,that is. Here you have another hypocrite with a selective morality that changesby the sentence to meet the needs of the moment. This is the guy, people ofAmerica, who is taking your freedom away.The “anti-terrorism” terroristJohn Negroponte is President Bush’s Ambassador to the United Nations, clearly avital role in the “war on terrorism”. Negroponte knows all about the subjectfrom his days as US ambassador to Honduras between 1981 and 1985 where he helpedto coordinate America’s covert war against the Sandinista government inNicaragua. During his spell in Honduras, US aid to that country soared from $3.9million in 1980 to $77.4 million in 1984. This funded so many US bases and somuch weaponry that the country became known as USS Honduras. A four-part seriesin the Baltimore Sun in 1995 exposed the widespread murder and torture there byBattalion 316, a “secret army” trained and funded by the CIA. The outstandingAustralian journalist (a real one), John Pilger, wrote in the UK’s New Statesmanmagazine:> “How appropriate that John Negroponte is Bush’s ambassador at the United> Nations. This week, he delivered America’s threat to the world that it may> ‘require’ to attack more and more countries. As US ambassador to Honduras in> the early 1980s, Negroponte oversaw American funding of the regime’s death> squads, known as Battalion 316, that wiped out the democratic opposition,> while the CIA ran its ‘contra’ war of terror against neighbouring Nicaragua.> Murdering teachers and slitting the throats of midwives were a speciality.” 19I can see why Bush chose him, then.Wendy “pathet lao” ChamberlainThe US Ambassador to Pakistan who has played a pivotal role in the vitalrelationship between Pakistan and the United States since September 11th isWendy Chamberlain, who is described innocently in an official profile I read asa “mother of two”. The lady is rather more than that, as you would expect as anappointee of George W. Bush, or, more accurately, of those who control him.(Forgive me if I find it hard to believe that Boy George is making the foreignpolicy decisions when, during his election campaign, he thought Nigeria was acontinent, failed to name the presidents of Chechnya, Pakistan and India,confused Slovakia and Slovenia, and asserted that Greeks were called ‘Grecians’and East Timorese were East Timorians.)20 Before Bush sent Wendy Chamberlain toPakistan in the weeks before 9/11, she was Deputy Assistant Secretary at theInternational Narcotics and Law Bureau of the State Department. But she is bestknown for her period as US Ambassador to Laos while that country was controlledby the terrorists of the Pathet Lao regime. She got along with these terroristdictators extremely well, it would appear. Philip Smith, director of the LaoVeterans of America, led the opposition to Chamberlain’s appointment to Pakistanfrom the 350,000-strong Lao and Hmong exile community in the United States. “Thefreedom-loving people in Pakistan, Afghanistan and South Asia need to beinformed and aware that Wendy Chamberlain has a deplorable track record of utterand total appeasement,” he said. “She has never met a military general ordictatorship that she did not like.” A letter circulated on the Internet by theLao Veterans, dated June 29th 2001, urged confirmation hearings to blockChamberlain’s appointment to Pakistan and revealed some of the “highlights” ofher period in Laos:> “The Laotian and Hmong-American community is overwhelmingly opposed to the> confirmation of Wendy Chamberlain as Ambassador to Pakistan given her> deplorable track-record of total appeasement in Laos (see news report from> Washington, DC, in Agence France Press, June 26th 2001). We will “never> forget” the deaths of our people, and relatives, in Laos under her terrible> and arrogant reign. She worked to strengthen the hands of the generals and the> military dictatorship. We, therefore, ask that you put an immediate “hold” on> her confirmation on the Senate floor to send a powerful message that State> Department officials involved in countenancing crimes against humanity and> gross human rights violations against the relatives of Lao and Hmong-Americans> will not be rewarded with promotions – especially a promotion to such an> important position. Moreover, by putting a “hold” on Chamberlain on the Senate> Floor, it will send an important message that a new policy toward Laos is> needed–not the weak and pandering policy of appeasement that Chamberlain so> vigorously promoted and that cost so many innocent people their lives.> “Clearly, Ambassador Chamberlain has never met a military general or> dictatorship that she did not like – and did not work to appease. She is> utterly unfit for a senior Ambassadorship in Pakistan, a country of immense> importance to US national security interests, compared to the tiny,> third-world nation of Laos, which she, somehow, totally bungled at the cost of> many lives. It should be noted that Ms Chamberlain served disgracefully as US> Ambassador to Laos where she “went native” (dressing in native costumes at> late-night parties with Pathet Lao communist generals where she frequently> drank excessively and submissively catered to every whim of the military junta> at the expense of the United States and its citizens). Indeed, Chamberlain> worked overtime to appease the military generals in Laos – while the relatives> of Lao and Hmong-Americans died at the cruel hands of the regime. She also> countenanced the massacre of thousands of Hmong and Lao civilians and> opposition leaders in Laos during her deplorable tenure. Moreover, she did> nothing to gain access or intervene to reopen Xeng Khouang (Xieng Khouang),> Sysamboun “Special Zone,” and other often-closed areas of Laos – including the> Lao gulag system in Sam Neua and elsewhere – where military crackdowns and> ethnic cleansing operations occurred against thousands of Hmong and Lao> people.” 21She sounds like a perfect Bush appointment. In fact, Chamberlain’s behaviour inLaos was so disgraceful that the US House of Representatives took theunprecedented step of introducing legislation in response.22 House Resolution332 cites Chamberlain’s behaviour and methods that included the collaborationwith communist Pathet Lao officials (terrorists) over the disappearance of twoHmong-Americans. This was the lady appointed by Bush to the key post ofAmbassador to Pakistan months before 9/11 and the “war on terrorism” in whichPakistan would be of major importance. Bush, or rather his masters, alsoappointed Christina Rocca as US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asiaweeks before 9/11. Her bureau is responsible for US foreign policy and relationswith Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan andSri Lanka. Rocca is a career officer of the CIA going back through the FatherBush and Reagan years at least to 1982. She, like Deputy Secretary of StateRichard Armitage, was involved in CIA operations relating to the war betweenAfghanistan and the Soviet Union when Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network wasfunded and armed into being by the CIA. Rocca has shown a keen interest inAfghanistan and Pakistan affairs for many years.The Queen’s buddyCoordinating communications between Washington and London since September 11thhas been the American Ambassador to Britain (or the Court of St James’s to beaccurate), one William Stamps Farish III. This is the grandson of William StampsFarish, the president of the Rockefellers’ Standard Oil, New Jersey, (nowExxon), when they were supplying Hitler and the Nazis with fuel during theSecond World War. A letter written by Standard Oil Vice President Frank A.Howard, to William S. Farish was released by the US Justice Department at thetime. Remember that I.G. Farben was at the very core of the Nazi war machine andran concentration camps like the one at Auschwitz. The letter to Farish said:> “… In England I met by appointment the Royal Dutch [Shell Oil] gentlemen from> Holland and … a general agreement was reached on the necessary changes in our> relations with the I.G. [Farben], in view of the state of war … the Royal> Dutch Shell Group is essentially British…I also had several meetings with the> [British] air ministry …> “I required the help to obtain the necessary permission to go to Holland …> After discussions with the [American] Ambassador [Joseph Kennedy, JFK’s> father] … the situation was cleared completely … The gentlemen of the Air> Ministry … very kindly offered to assist me in re-entering England.> “Pursuant to these arrangements, I was able to keep my appointment in Holland> (having been flown there on a British Air Force bomber), where I had three> days of discussion with the representatives of I.G. They delivered to me> assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and … we did our best to work out> complete plans for a modus vivendi which could operate through the term of the> war, whether or not the US came in.”William S. Farish refuelled Nazi shipping and submarines in Spain and LatinAmerica during the war and it was the Standard Oil/I.G. Farben enterprise thatopened the Auschwitz Camp on June 14th 1940, and used the slave labour of Jews,political opponents, gypsies, and others to produce artificial rubber andgasoline from coal. Farish was very close to Hermann Schmitz, the chairman ofI.G. Farben. Standard Oil hired the Illuminati publicist Ivy Lee to promote I.G.Farben and the Nazis in the United States (see And The Truth Shall Set You Freefor the detailed background). In this same period, Prescott Bush, PresidentBush’s grandfather, was helping to fund the Nazis and so you would expect theBushes and the Farish family to be close. Farish’s grandson, William S. FarishIII, became a very close friend and associate of Father George and a bosom buddyof the Queen of England. She has visited his Lane’s End ranch in Kentucky manytimes, taking her horses to breed with Farish’s prize stallions. She apparentlytravels by Royal Air Force plane to the Blue Grass Airport in Lexington on theseoccasions.23 As I said earlier, when Father George Bush became Vice President toReagan, he had to (officially) hand over his business affairs and investments toa “blind trust” and the man chosen to run it was the same William S. Farish III,the US Ambassador in London and the middleman in the “war on terrorism” betweenthe Bush, Blair, and the Queen. Wherever you look it is clear that what hasfollowed September 11th has been coordinated throughout by the Bush cartel.Tony BlairSince the election of Tony Blair as UK Prime Minister on May 1st 1997, a couphas taken place in Britain. Blair, who should by law be an accountable PrimeMinister running the country in cooperation with his cabinet, has become“President Blair”, running his own agenda in league with unelected “advisers”.Mo Mowlam was Blair’s former Secretary for Northern Ireland and she was the onlymember of his sycophantic, spineless, bunch of shady main-chancers (his“cabinet”) that I would trust to tell me the time. After she left thegovernment, she told the BBC documentary, Cabinet Confidential: “Tony’s actingmore like a president than a prime minister and in that situation the cabinetitself is dead”. Mowlam suggested that the unelected advisers have more powerthan the cabinet in relation to the prime minister. “They seemed to be operatinginstead of the cabinet,” she said, and she continued:> “He makes decisions with a small coterie of people, advisers, just like the> president of the United States. He doesn’t go back to cabinet, he isn’t> inclusive in terms of other cabinet ministers and if he really wants to get> the support of the public and the support of Parliament there has to be more> people included.” 24As in Nazi Germany, you are not allowed to speak out against Herr Blair. Freedomof speech and having a right to an opinion is only accepted if Blair agrees withwhat you say. The difference is that in Nazi Germany they assassinated you forchallenging the Fuhrer and in Blair’s Britain they assassinate your character.Mowlam was “Our Mo” when she was in the Blair cabinet and “Mad Mo” when shestarted challenging high command. One of Blair’s “BIGs” – Buffoons in Government– who has dismissed her in such terms is the punch-throwing and in my view oafof a Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott. Along with Foreign Secretary Jack“straw man” Straw, Prescott is perhaps the number one “BIG” in the Blair cabinetfrom where I’m sitting. Blair, in truth, has become a dictator masquerading as ademocratic prime minister and since September 11th he has been a law untohimself. The BBC documentary showed how Blair’s “war cabinet” included hisunelected director of communications and strategy, Alistair Campbell, and thenewly appointed head of government relations, Sally Morgan. Campbell, a formertabloid journalist, is paid by a Civil Service that is supposed to bepolitically impartial and yet he is a Labour supporter whose role in the Blaircircle is to spin news and events to present his “boss” in the best light and toget the people to see the world in a way that suits Blair’s agenda. None of thisis a surprise to me because to my eyes Blair has always had a large notice onhis forehead warning: “Not to be trusted”. I felt this long before he becamePrime Minister. I have said in previous books and talks that he was anIlluminati place man put in power to serve the cause, which included taking theUK into the European single currency, dropping the pound sterling, and absorbingBritish independence into the European fascist superstate. I wrote that yearsago and that is precisely what he is doing, helped by the pathetic LiberalDemocrats of Charles Kennedy. Anyone who supports the Euro single currency issupporting their own financial imprisonment by unelected bankers working to theIlluminati agenda for global control.The chosen oneTony Charles Lynton Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on May 6th 1953. Hisfather, Leo, was a law lecturer at Edinburgh University, a major educationalcentre for the Illuminati. Blair grew up in the industrial city of Durham, whichis most famous for its cathedral, and also lived in Australia for three years.He was educated at the Durham Choristers School before returning to Edinburgh toattend the prestigious (if you like that sort of thing) Fettes College. Blairwent on to Oxford University and then took a legal apprenticeship at thechambers of Alexander Irvine, a Queens Counsel and influential in the LabourParty. Blair became a barrister specialising in industrial and employment law,and met his lawyer wife, Cherie, during his apprenticeship. They married in 1980and have four children, Euan, Nicky, Kathryn and Leo (who, on May 20th 2000,became the first child to be born to a sitting prime minister in 152 years).Blair’s brother, William James Lynton Blair QC, also went into law from this“ordinary family” and has been a consultant with the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund. In 1983, Blair was elected to Parliament as theLabour MP for Sedgefield, near Durham in the north-east of England, and began arapid rise the top. He was given a number of jobs in the Labour shadow cabinetduring the long years of Labour opposition to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservativegovernment and her successor, John Major, who is now European representative ofthe Carlyle Group.At some point in the Blair story he clearly became the chosen one for somepowerful forces and within 24 hours of the sudden death of the then Labour Partyleader John Smith from a heart attack, the whole of the British media hadalready decided that Blair was his successor. I still think there is more toknow about Smith’s death. The wave of support for Blair within a Labour Partythat had been out of government for so long was fuelled by the media messagethat here was the only person who could lead them back to Downing Street. Blairwas elected leader of the party in July 1994, a year after he had been invitedto attend his first meeting of the Illuminati’s secretive Bilderberg Group in ahotel at Vouliagment, Greece. Blair took control of the Labour Party at everylevel and has transformed it into a fiercely centralised dictatorship, apersonalised, customised vehicle for his (the Illuminati’s) agenda. It hasbecome a vacuum of principle in which Blair’s word is law. And Blair iscontrolled by the shadowy figures that decide what his word will be. With themedia propaganda machine behind him, Blair, at 44, became the youngest BritishPrime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 when he was elected by a landslideon May 1st 1997. Months earlier I had said in public talks that not only wouldBlair be the next UK prime minister, but that he would be elected on May Ist –an extremely important date in the Illuminati ritual calendar (see The BiggestSecret). In the UK it is the sitting prime minister who decides the date of thegeneral election. In this case that was John “Carlyle Group” Major, theConservative leader. Major chose May 1st.Dancing for RupertOne of Blair’s most significant supporters is the major Illuminati media tycoonRupert Murdoch. His News Corporation has some 800 subsidiaries and owns the UKTimes, Sunday Times, and the downmarket tabloids the Sun and News of the World.His holdings also include Sky Global Networks, which owns the satellitetelevision company BSkyB. Murdoch controls Twentieth Century Fox, the Fox TVnetwork, New York Post, and close to 200 newspapers worldwide, to name only someof his holdings. Murdoch had always thrown his UK newspapers behind theConservative candidate in UK elections, but when Blair became Labour leader, allthat suddenly changed. Blair was now his man. This has been incrediblybeneficial for Blair and it also ensures access on demand to the UK PrimeMinster for Murdoch. It was alleged that after the 1997 election win Blair rangthe Bilderberger Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to help Murdoch to expandhis empire in Italy by buying into the Mediaset empire. This was owned byanother Illuminati media and political front man, the convicted crook SilvioBerlusconi, who became, staggeringly, Italian Prime Minister. Murdoch’sdaughter, Elisabeth, a News Corporation executive, is a close friend of Blair’slong-time spinner Peter Mandelson.One major example of this Blair-Murdoch relationship came in May 2002 whenBlair’s government announced plans to change the rules on media ownership toallow Murdoch to expand his holdings in Britain against all the principles ofmedia diversity. A year earlier Murdoch visited Blair at Downing Street to“discuss his concerns over Britain’s cross-ownership laws”.25 These “concerns”were related to rules that prevented him from owning a terrestrial televisionstation because his newspapers have a 33% share of the UK market and he alsoowns the satellite TV network BSkyB. But with all of his newspapers supportingBlair during election campaigns, Murdoch has no problem telling the PrimeMinister what to do, and the easing of media regulations means that Murdoch cannow buy the terrestrial station Channel 5 if he wishes. Blair also opened theway for corporations outside of Europe to own British television companies. Themajor ITV network, once owned by many companies in the various regions of thecountry, will be allowed to become one centrally owned operation. The rules willnow permit this network to be bought by Illuminati corporations like Disney andAOL/TimeWarner and it also allows the ITV network and Channel 5 to be owned bythe same people. Channel 5 is currently controlled by the Illuminati media giantBertelsmann, which is reported to have ambitions to dominate the UK commercialtelevision market. Bertelsmann is a Germany-based company whose Americanprinting operation suddenly, without any warning, refused to print my books inearly 2002. Something I said chaps? Blair also plans to allow the same people toown more than one national radio station, and newspaper groups can buy radiostations. The rules preventing one radio group owning more than 15% of themarket are scrapped. All these changes by Blair are precisely in line with theIlluminati agenda for centralisation of media power. Like I say, Blair is a100%, wholly owned subsidiary of the Illuminati.We are full of sleaze if you please …From the moment Blair walked into Downing Street he has slavishly pursued theIlluminati agenda, pressing for further centralisation of the European Union andconceding more and more power to the Brussels bureaucrats over British law andsociety. He has all along been preparing to replace the pound sterling with theeuro as I said in my books back in the 1990s and he has backed every Illuminatimilitary intervention by deploying British forces and supporting the Americangovernment at every turn in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and the “war onterrorism” in general. He has also showered government jobs and patronage on hisfriends, supporters and associates in the same way the Bushes do in America.“Tony’s Cronies” has become a common phrase in British political life. Also likethe Bushes, he enjoys massive support from the top business leaders andcorporations as the gap between rich and poor (which the Labour Party was formed100 years ago to close) gets wider and wider under Herr Blair. On May 14th 2001,before Blair won his second term, 58 business leaders wrote a letter to RupertMurdoch’s Times newspaper urging business to support a Blair victory. They werechairmen or chief executives and a number had been knighted or given other“honours” by Blair, who has turned the United Kingdom political scene into amirror of that headquarters of political slush and sleaze, the United States.Indeed Blair insists that he and President Bush think alike.26Blair’s Downing Street “Chief of Staff” Jonathan Powell is supposed to be animpartial civil servant who is paid by the taxpayer. Yet he once worked for theLabour Party raising money through “donations” from business. Clearly he’s stillworking for the Labour Party, it’s just that they aren’t paying for him – thepeople are. The deeply corrupt Enron Corporation donated money to Blair’s LabourParty and saw changes unfold in government energy policy that suited theiragenda. Blair says the two were not connected. Then there was the bizarre storyof Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel tycoon and one of the richest men inBritain. At the end of May 2001, Mr Mittal gave £125,000 to the Labour Partyshortly before the general election in which Blair won his second term. Afterhis victory Blair sent a letter to the Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastasesupporting the takeover of Sidex, its nationalised steel company, by Mr Mittal’sfirm, LNM. Days later Romania awarded the £300 million sale to Mr Mittal in theface of French competition. Mr Blair said he sent the letter because he wassupporting a “British company” and not because of the very large cheque MrMittal had given his party. This is a lie. Mittal’s LNM is a multi-nationalcorporation registered in the Caribbean tax haven of the Dutch Antilles and ofthe 125,000 people it employees worldwide, fewer than 100 live in the UK! 27 Notonly that, but Mr Mittal’s empire is in direct competition with British firmsthat do employ British people. When the story broke, the lies poured out ofDowning Street as always. They said that Mittal’s donation was made after thegeneral election (lie); they said his company was British (lie); that Blair hadonly signed the letter drafted by the Foreign Office as a matter of routine (lie– the letter was amended and rewritten by Blair’s office); they said it was onlya letter of congratulation and did not affect the deal (lie – the BritishEmbassy in Bucharest said it was an important factor in clinching the contract).Mittal’s wife also gave £5,000 to the constituency fund of Keith Vaz, Blair’sformer Minister for Europe, who faced a major Parliamentary investigation intohis financial activities and behaviour that led to him being suspended fromParliament for a month. I cannot stress it enough – these are the people tellingyou what happened on September 11th and who was responsible! A website calledRed Star Research keeps tabs on the Herr Blair Bunch of special advisers andbusiness leaders that influence government policy and pay the Labour Partybills.28The cynical nature of Blair and his government was highlighted in May 2002 in aPanorama documentary on BBC television. This revealed how Blair had spent recordsums of taxpayers’ money on “government information” advertisements in the weeksbefore the general election that gave him a second term. In the 12 months beforethe election the government was the UK’s biggest buyer of advertising with arecord £192 million being spent – up 70% on the previous year – and almost halfof that money was used between January and March 2001 in the run-up to theelection. A record £49 million was spent in the March alone. Governmentadvertising is purchased through a government department called COICommunications, which is supposed to be independent of party politics. Theadvertising itself is supposed to be used to inform the public about changes inthe law and policy. Instead, as Panorama clearly demonstrated, Blair used thistaxpayers’ money to promote his government in an effort to increase his supportat the coming election. What cynical corruption of the system, what contempt forthe people he claims to represent. Tony Blair, again like Bush, is one of themost blatantly and transparently insincere politicians I have ever seen in aprofession that is largely insincere by reflex action. His “off the cuff”remarks are carefully rehearsed and worded – as with his “spontaneous” tributeto Princess Diana on the day she was murdered in Paris in 1997 (see The BiggestSecret). It turned out he had been rehearsing the “spontaneity” all morning withhis spinner Alistair Campbell. You can always tell when Blair has beenrehearsing an “emotional, heartfelt, statesmanlike” and “spontaneous” responsebecause he keeps pausing between words and looking down in the contrived mannerof some C-movie actor. Blair also strenuously denied that Diana’s death wasanything more than an accident, and resisted an independent investigation.Tony two–tonguesJournalist John Pilger highlighted a classic example of Blair double-speak whenhe wrote of … “the grotesque hypocrisy of Tony Blair weeping for the children ofDunblane, then sending machine guns that mow down children in East Timor …” 29With Blair and his ministers and officials working as the sales and marketingteam, Britain is the second biggest exporter of arms in the world (second toguess who?) and the single biggest arms manufacturer on the planet is BritishAerospace. These weapons are used by terrorists of all kinds in the Middle Eastand across the world.30 In 1975, Britain sold arms abroad worth $470 million. By1995 it was 4.7 billion.31 Ironically, but appropriately in the circumstances,on the morning of September 11th 2001 as those planes were hijacked, a protestwas under way in the Docklands area of London against the biggest “arms fair” –death and terror market place – yet held in Britain. While Tony Blair was infront of the cameras condemning terrorism, British arms manufacturers were downthe road in Docklands seeking to sell weapons for terrorism with the fullsupport of Tony Blair. Nothing captures the cold, calculating, heartlessapproach of the Blair government better than the case of Jo Moore, the Blaircrony and adviser to the former Transport Secretary Stephen Byers. Within anhour of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center, and while therest of the world looked on in stunned horror, Jo Moore was sending an e-mail toBlair government colleagues saying that the disaster had provided a goodopportunity that day to “bury” controversial stories they did not want to bepublicised. Blair and Byers both had a very public opportunity to stand forcommon decency in their government by sacking Ms Moore. They refused to do sodespite the public outrage that followed, and it was only much later afteranother storm broke in her department that she was told to go. I’ll take nolectures on morality from Tony Blair, thank you very much.What a fantastic cesspit of sleaze, corruption, mass murder, drug running andterrorism we have had to wade through in these last five chapters. And pinchyourself: these are the same honest, fair, just, peace-loving, big-hearted,thoroughly trustworthy characters that have told us what happened on September11th, who was responsible, and what should happen as a consequence.

Edgar Hoover, the most infamous head of the FBI – and he should know!History is ablaze with examples of engineered terrorism and war that mirror theevents and aftermath of September 11th. I guess if the technique keeps working,why change it? In my other books you will find many of these recounted indetail, but here are some of the problem-reaction-solutions of enormousrelevance to the events of September 11th. For those who are new to thisinformation the parallels will be startling.The Oklahoma bombThere was a “rehearsal” for what happened on September 11th. It came some sixyears earlier on April 19th 1995 when a massive bomb, or bombs in truth,destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and 168 people, many ofthem children at a day care centre, were killed. All the classic features werethere: the problem of a “terrorist attack” on a US federal building; the villainor “patsy” named immediately as Timothy McVeigh; the reaction of understandableoutrage from the people as they saw the devastation and believed thegovernment’s version of events; and the solution, with a series of measures thatremoved civil liberties and targeted the so-called Christian Patriot or militiamovement that had been having considerable success exposing the globalconspiracy in the years before. It was claimed that McVeigh was connected to themilitia underground and his alleged accomplice, Terry Nichols, was alsoportrayed as some white supremacist and racist even though his two marriages hadbeen to a Mexican and a Filipino. McVeigh was executed and Nichols is currentlyserving a life sentence. “Anti-terrorism” bills were rushed through Congress indays and at least some had clearly been written and printed before the bombing.They included all the elements of destroying civil liberties that have beenstill further extended as a result of 9/11. Within 24 hours of the carnage,President Bill Clinton was calling for “ …an easing of restrictions on themilitary’s involvement in domestic law enforcement”. Once again this wasachieved to an even greater extent after September 11th.Clinton also used the bombing to urge the media to ban “anti-governmentextremists” from their papers, screens and microphones, and he attacked thealternative talk radio shows that are designed to give the public a rareopportunity to hear and communicate information that differs from the officialline. The bombing was said to have been a response by McVeigh to the murder ofmen, women and children by the United States government at Waco, Texas, on April19th 1993. One of the government agencies blamed for Waco was the Bureau ofAlcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), which had offices in the Murrah Building andthe official story says that they were the target. In “response” to the bombing,one bill1 proposed by the Democrat Charles Schumer, now the Senator for New YorkState, included five-year prison sentences for publicly engaging in “unseemlyspeculation” and publishing or transmitting by wire or electronic means“baseless conspiracy theories regarding the Federal government of the UnitedStates”. Naturally, the government would decide if it was “baseless”. Schumerhad also vehemently dismissed evidence of the mass murder in Waco in a way thatbeggared belief. His fascist bill never became law, but you watch them try againwhenever they think they can succeed. Already the FBI “Joint Anti-Terrorism TaskForce” has issued flyers urging the public to call with information aboutpossible “terrorists” within the United States. The flyers say that among thepeople to watch for are “‘defenders’ of the US Constitution against the federalgovernment and UN”; people who make “numerous references to the Constitution”;those who “attempt to police the police”; and “Lone individuals”.2Oklahoma fantasyThere is another tell-tale sign with these set-ups and stings, be it Oklahoma,the Kennedy assassination or September 11th. The official story is so full ofuntruths and glaring contradictions that anyone with half a brain could take itapart. The US government claimed that a fertiliser and fuel oil bomb left byMcVeigh in a Ryder truck destroyed the Murrah Building. He was executed bylethal injection on June 11th 2001 and became the first federal execution for 38years. Actually, I say he was executed; there are those who question even that.Susan Carlson, a reporter for WLS-AM Radio in Chicago, witnessed the “execution”at Terre Haute, Indiana, and says that McVeigh “… appeared to be still breathingor what appeared to be shallow breathing, even after being pronounced dead andhis eyes remained open”.3 McVeigh had said he was micro-chipped while serving inthe US forces and to understand, perhaps, why he would not vigorously defendhimself when he could not possibly have been responsible for that scale of deathand devastation we would need to know what was going on and being said orthreatened behind the scenes. Significantly when McVeigh was first arrested hewas given a “mental assessment” by Louis Jolyon West from the University ofCalifornia. What the newspaper reports of this did not say is that West is oneof the most notorious CIA mind controllers in America, as my books and manyothers have revealed (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The BiggestSecret). Another interesting coincidence is that two years before the Oklahomabomb, Martin Keating, the brother of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, wrote abook called The Final Jihad. This was a novel about a terrorist attack on the“Oklahoma City Building” by a man called Thomas McVeigh. Keating dedicated thebook to the “Knights of the Secret Circle”.The provable lieThe FBI said the Murrah Building was destroyed by a single ammonium nitratetruck bomb in a 20-foot Ryder rental truck parked outside by McVeigh. Theproblem is that this is provably impossible. You have only got to look at thesmall crater left where the truck was standing to see that the explosive powercould never have brought down the Murrah Building and there are other littledetails like the fact that while some pillars closer to the truck bomb did notfall, others further away did. Retired Brigadier General Benton K. Partin saidfrom the start that the fuel-fertiliser device in the Ryder truck could notpossibly have brought down the Murrah Building. Too many facts, he said, simplydidn’t add up. Partin is no anti-government “extremist”, although that was theway he was portrayed in order to discredit his devastating information. He waschairman of the Republican Party in Fairfax County, Virginia, for four years andamong a long list of US Air Force appointments he was Commander of the ArmamentLaboratory, the top research and development facility at Elgin Air Force Base inFlorida. During his 31 years of active duty he became a highly acclaimed expertin weapons systems and explosives, and his Air Force and civilian career recordis extremely long and impressive. Partin’s detailed assessment of the bombinghas been widely quoted in the alternative media, but virtually ignored in themainstream even though it destroys the official story. Actually, make thatbecause it destroys the official story. Partin’s report, dated July 30th 1995,says that the serious damage and demolition to supporting columns inside thebuilding could only have been caused by devices attached to, or placed within,the columns. It was simply not possible for that to be achieved by an explosionfrom outside the building. Yes, the truck bomb could have shattered windows andscattered considerable debris, but the laws of physics mean that it could notbring down concrete pillars that distance away. Partin pointed out that “ …mostpeople fail to appreciate how inefficient a blast is in air and how dramaticallyits destructive potential drops off just a few feet from the explosion”.4 Themain columns in the Murrah Building were made to survive pressure of more than3,000 pounds per square inch. There is no way, as Partin’s report points out,for a fuel-fertiliser bomb that far from the building to generate more than afraction of that pressure. However, Partin says that the fantastic damage to theMurrah Building could have been caused by a total of just 150 pounds ofexplosive if it was located in the right places on the right support columns.5Dr Rodger Raubach, a PhD in physical chemistry and member of the researchfaculty at Stanford University, said: “General Partin’s assessment is absolutelycorrect. I don’t care if they pulled up a semi-trailer truck with 20 tons ofammonium nitrate; it wouldn’t do the damage we saw there.” 6 Faced with thesefacts about the impossibility of a truck bomb causing the damage, the “McVeighbomb” began to miraculously increase in size. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, and other government agencies originally said the bomb contained 1,200pounds of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO). But, as if by magic, it was tobecome 4,000 pounds and eventually 4,800. I even heard 7,000 pounds quoted inthe media around the time of McVeigh’s execution in 2001. But a study by the USAir Force confirmed that even at 4,800 pounds, the story does not make sense:> “It is impossible to ascribe the damage that occurred on April 19th, 1995, to> a single truck bomb containing 4,800 pounds … In fact, the maximum predicted> damage of the floor panels of the Murrah federal building is equal to> approximately 1% of the total floor area of the building.> “It must be concluded that the damage at the Murrah federal building is not> the result of the truck bomb itself, but rather due to other factors such as> locally placed charges within the building itself.” 7This report was not presented at McVeigh’s trial, together with 4,000 pages ofother evidence that the FBI claimed to have “lost”. The FBI, the same FBI now“investigating” 9/11, also interviewed General Partin but did nothing when heshowed that the official story was impossible. He sent copies of his detailedengineering analysis, including colour photographs, to every member of Congressand more than 1,000 media organisations. Only a handful of replies came back.They would rather the orchestrators of mass murder remain at large than revealthat the government and its agencies are lying at every turn. Yet people stillsay to me that if the conspiracy I am exposing were true the media would tell usabout it! Researcher J. Orlin Grabbe and others have revealed that a secretPentagon report on the bombing came to basically the same conclusions as Partin.Grabbe says the Pentagon commissioned nine explosives experts to write reportsand accepted two of them as the “official” report.8 He says he spoke to bothexperts, but they declined to be interviewed because of “confidentialityagreements with the Pentagon”. Grabbe says that sources familiar with thePentagon report told him that the conclusions were the same as those of GeneralPartin, except that the Pentagon report concluded there were demolition chargesplaced on five columns, not the four suggested by Partin.These findings are not only supported by the science, but by witness accounts.Many said they heard more than one explosion. A 500-page report by the OklahomaCity Bombing Investigation Commission said that many witnesses “have testifiedto hearing a second bomb” and that “explosives experts contend that the extentof the damage to the building could not have resulted from a single truck bomb…” 9 The seismographic record at the Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS) at theUniversity of Oklahoma recorded two “seismic events” at the time the MurrahBuilding was hit and a geophysicist at the OGS, Dr Raymon L. Brown, told NewAmerican magazine that the simplest explanation for this was that there were“two separate explosions”.10 Witnesses support this. After rescuers arrived onthe scene there were many reports of other bombs being found and defused, andthe area was evacuated several times. Volunteers at the site and televisionviewers remember how the police and fire authorities warned that another device,or devices, had been found in the rubble. If you watch recordings of stationslike KFOR-TV, Channel 9 News, and Channel 4 News from that morning you see thereporters and witnesses talking of other bombs on the site that had notexploded. (You can see this footage in the video 911 – The Road To Tyranny,presented by Alex Jones. It is available through Infowars.com[http://www.infowars.com]) Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating tells oneinterviewer: “Reports that I have is that one device was deactivated, apparentlythere’s another device …” A television presenter quotes the FBI as saying thatthe explosion was caused by a “very sophisticated device and had to have beendone by an explosives expert”. A spokesman for the rescue teams says that theyare not able to get into the wreckage to retrieve the injured because of theunexploded bombs still in the building. A reporter with KWTV said that he hadjust seen a bomb squad truck going towards the Murrah Building to defuse anotherdevice. Senator Charles Key’s Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee confirmedthese reports. It concluded: “There is sufficient evidence to confirm that lawenforcement agencies in Oklahoma City, as well as Washington DC, had sufficientprior knowledge of the impending disaster, yet took minimum measures to avertthe bombing. Documents and witnesses support this conclusion.” The report saidthere were at least four sightings of other bombs in the building.11 Accordingto police logs and firefighter witnesses, it was the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms (ATF) that removed these unexploded bombs from the scene. This isthe organisation that was supposed to have been McVeigh’s target in the officialcover story. We were told at different times that other bombs were found, noother bombs were found, and that bombs were found, but they were “dummies” usedfor training by the ATF. Soon all of this was forgotten and the official versionof what happened dominated the media.Rubble troubleThe rubble from the Murrah Building contained the proof of where the bombs werereally located, what they were, and how many there were. All that was requiredto establish what had happened beyond doubt was for explosives experts to go inand do their analysis. General Partin made this very point and requested thatthe site be protected so this investigation could take place. He wrote to theOklahoma Senator Don Nickles and delivered the letter personally to hisWashington office and those of some 23 other senators and around 30 congressmenon May 18th 1995. He wrote:> “I am concerned that vital evidence will soon be destroyed with the pending> demolition of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. From all the evidence I> have seen in the published material, I can say with a high level of confidence> that the damage pattern on the reinforced concrete superstructure could not> possibly have been attained from the single truck bomb without supplementing> demolition charges at some of the reinforced column bases. The total> incompatibility with a single truck bomb lies in the fact that either some of> the columns collapsed that should not have collapsed or some of the columns> are still standing that should have collapsed and did not.” 12Instead of listening to General Partin, the government hired a company calledControlled Demolition to bring down the rest of the building and take the rubbleto a private landfill site operated by BFI Waste Systems. Here the remains ofthe Murrah Building were kept under guard by the Wackenhut Corporation, one ofthe Illuminati’s private armies, which I mentioned earlier in relation to thechemical weapons equipment shipped by Wackenhut to Saddam Hussein before theGulf War. George Wackenhut, a former FBI operative, started the company withother FBI associates in 1954, and recruits from the FBI, CIA, and the militaryhave dominated its board. George Wackenhut is a long-time friend of Father Bushand has funded his political campaigns along with those of Boy George andFlorida governor Jeb Bush. McVeigh’s defence team and independent explosivesexperts were refused access to the rubble that would have revealed all. If thatis not the most blatant admission that there is something to hide, I don’t knowwhat is. Ironically, on its own website Controlled Demolition says of the Murrahcontract: “When a crime scene involves the detonation of explosives, and thepossibility of undetonated materials exist, an experienced contractor is neededto preserve evidence critical to ongoing investigations while dealing with anyexplosives discovered.” 13 So why was McVeigh’s defence not allowed access toany virgin remains to conduct such investigations? Controlled Demolition says itwas hired to work at the Murrah Building and instigate a “timely implosion” ofthe ruins. The company says on its website:> “[At the request of] … the General Services Administration (GSA), and> subsequently that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Controlled> Demolition Incorporated (CDI), was able to assist in analysing the integrity> of the unstable Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Controlled> Demolition’s team coordinated with rescue and body retrieval efforts by> authorities, salvaged evidence for the FBI’s investigation, prepared the> building for implosion, and completed the demolition sequence in a continuous> work program. Controlled Demolition Incorporated is equipped to work closely> with governmental agencies under complex project scenarios that demand> professionalism and attention to detail while working under difficult site,> political and emotional conditions.” 14The company is owned by the Loizeaux family and headed by Mark Loizeaux out ofBaltimore, just a short drive from Washington DC. In February 2000, a FederalGrand Jury indicted Mark Loizeaux, Douglas Loizeaux and Controlled Demolition oncharges of falsely reporting campaign contributions by asking family members andemployees to donate to the campaign of Elijah E. Cummings, a DemocratRepresentative for Maryland. The Baltimore Sun reported that the illegalcontributions allegedly occurred between 1996 and 1998, but the Loizeauxbrothers and the company were acquitted in September 2000. Controlled Demolitioncertainly seems to be well respected by the United States government and itsagencies because it has been awarded federal contracts worth billions. Six yearsafter it carried away the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahomaand took it to a safe place guarded by Wackenhut, Controlled Demolition washired by the government again for an even bigger job … removing the remains ofthe World Trade Center.Same old storyAs with 9/11 the government’s version of the Oklahoma bombing is a mass of liesand manipulation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or the ATF as itis known, was supposed to be McVeigh’s target. How convenient and strange,therefore, that no ATF agents were killed or injured because they weremiraculously not in the office that morning. There were no badge-carryingfederal agents in the building, only civilian workers.15 When these facts becameknown, the ATF wheeled out agent Alex McCauley who told of the heroic efforts tohelp to rescue victims by himself and a fellow agent, who was said to havefallen three floors in an elevator and survived. But Duane James, the buildingmaintenance supervisor, proved technically and logistically that the story was alie. It was “pure fantasy”, he said, and the ATF had to retract the story andadmit that McCauley was nowhere near the building let alone in it. They willnot, however, say where he or any of their other personnel were.16 Federal JudgeWayne Alley was not in his chambers across the street from the Murrah Buildingeither. He told the Oregonian newspaper that he had decided not to go to workthat day because “there had been talk”. He said:> “Let me just say that within the past two or three weeks, information has been> disseminated … that indicated concerns on the part of people who ought to> know, that we ought to be a little more careful … My subjective impression was> there was a reason for a dissemination of these concerns.” 17In other words, he was warned off and took the advice. Witnesses who spoke withATF agents at the scene have confirmed this. When asked if any of their men wereinjured they said they were not in the building because they had been tipped offthrough their pagers not to go into work that day. Tiffany Bible, a paramedicwho was at the Murrah Building within minutes of the blasts, swore in anaffidavit that she found the ATF in full combat gear (which apparently takeshalf an hour to put on) and they said they had been warned not to go to workthat day.Why was the bomb squad on site before the bombing?Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost two small children in the bombing, workedconstantly and passionately for years to uncover the truth of what happened.They conducted and documented more than 300 hours of interviews, and persuadedpeople to talk who had remained silent for fear of the consequences. Theyestablished beyond question that a heavily armed bomb squad had been in downtownOklahoma near the Murrah Building that morning before the bombs exploded. Manypeople saw them, including Oklahoma lawyer Daniel J. Adomitis, who was headingfor a charity board meeting at 7.30am, an hour and a half before the explosion:> “There was this fairly large truck with a trailer behind it. It had a shield> on the side of the door that said ‘bomb disposal’ or ‘bomb squad’ below it.> And I really found that interesting. You know, I’d never seen anything like> that in person.” 18Some parents saw these people in their bomb squad uniforms as they dropped theirchildren off at the day care centre at the Murrah Building, children they wouldnever see alive again. Eventually, after months of denial by the FBI and othergovernment agencies, the Sheriff’s Department had to admit that the bomb squadhad been there. The Wilburns were bitterly attacked by other bereaved familiesas they challenged the government story and they were denounced as “conspiracytheorists”. But in the end other families also became convinced that theauthorities had prior knowledge of the bombing – just as they had about 9/11.The Wilburns and many other families filed legal claims against the USgovernment alleging they had “detailed prior knowledge of the planned bombing ofthe Murrah Building yet failed to prevent the bombing from taking place” andclaimed that ATF agents were “alerted not to go to work on April 19th 1995”.19A few more little gems about the Oklahoma bombing. In early April, shortlybefore the attack, a Ryder truck was photographed from the air within theconcrete walls of a military compound near Camp Gruber-Braggs, Oklahoma, and youcan see these pictures on the Internet.20 Danny Colson, the FBI’s director ofthe terrorist task force, told Time magazine in 1999 that when he heard of theblast he had driven to Oklahoma from his home in Dallas at speeds of 100 milesan hour to support the rescue operation and the “investigation”. Oops, Dannyboy, caught by the round ones there darlin’. Colson checked into the EmbassySuites Hotel in Oklahoma at 12.20am on April 19th … just 9 hours before the bombwent off.21 Why? The FBI said it found McVeigh’s truck rental agency from avehicle identification number (VIN) on the Ryder truck’s rear axle. This axlewas somehow found both in the bomb crater (Mayor of Oklahoma press statement)and three blocks away (FBI). Must be one hell of an axle. Wherever it was found,the FBI story is another provable lie. Rear axles of vehicles manufactured inAmerica were not imprinted with a VIN and the Ryder rental company did not addthem to the axles either. The FBI also says that McVeigh rented the truck withboth his real ID and a false ID. This same FBI had to admit shortly beforeMcVeigh’s first scheduled execution that they had withheld 4,304 documents fromhis defence team and he was given a month-long stay of execution because ofthis. The FBI’s “star witness” against McVeigh was Michael Fortier, who admitsdoing a deal to testify for the prosecution in return for lighter sentences forgun offences. He told the court that he and McVeigh had made themselves familiarwith the Murrah Building weeks before the bombing to establish the location ofthe ATF offices. Well in that case why did McVeigh stop at a gas station in theRyder truck that morning and ask the way to the building? Why would he do thatanyway when he knew he would be recognised and reported after the bombing? Inthat one moment he connected himself to the Ryder truck and the Murrah Building.Why? If he had spent so much time locating the ATF offices, why did he park thetruck on the side of the Murrah Building furthest away from the ATF section whenhe could have left it directly underneath? We are also asked to believe – anddepressingly many do – that having connected himself with the Ryder truck andthe Murrah Building before the bombing by stopping at the gas station, he thenproceeded to “get away” undetected in a highly visible yellow car travelling atnearly 100 miles an hour with expired licence plates, and that when he wasstopped by the police for a traffic violation a man who had just murdered 168people and maimed hundreds made no attempt to avoid arrest even though he wasarmed and a highly trained soldier. It’s nonsense, of course it is, but theseare the people telling us what happened on September 11th, who did it and who weshould bomb in retaliation.McVeigh was arrested so conveniently for a traffic offence immediately after thebombing for the same reason that Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in a cinemaimmediately after the Kennedy assassination and Osama bin Laden was named as theculprit after 9/11. They are the patsies required by problem-reaction-solutionto hide the real orchestrators. Just as 9/11 was a massive version of whathappened in Oklahoma, so Oklahoma was a repeat of the Kennedy assassination. LeeHarvey Oswald was a US agent who was placed in the right place at the right timewithout being told exactly why he was there. He realised this after Kennedy wasshot and ran. When he was arrested he said he was a patsy, a stooge, and wouldhave said so in court. That’s why he was paraded in public to allow anothergovernment agent, Jack Ruby, to shoot him and kill the evidence (see And TheTruth Shall Set You Free). In the same way, very possibly, McVeigh was agovernment stooge who parked the Ryder truck without knowing the full story.This would explain why he saw no problem in stopping at the gas station to askthe way to the Murrah building and why he made such a “getaway” and offered noresistance to the police officer. McVeigh apparently said that he was not toldwhat the project was really all about and had been trapped, “framed”, and made apatsy to cover up high-level US government complicity.22Father Bush and the Iraqi connectionI almost completed a section without mentioning the Bush family, but naturallythat couldn’t last. It will stagger Americans to learn that at the end of theGulf War in 1991 President Father George Bush arranged for around 4,000 officersfrom the military and intelligence agencies of Iraq, mostly from the RepublicanGuard, to relocate in the United States; 2,000 of these officers became residentin … Oklahoma. Another 500 went to Lincoln, Nebraska. Father Bush arranged fortheir funding, housing and employment, and this has been continued by BillClinton and Baby Bush. Jayna Davis, a former reporter with NBC affiliate KFOR-TVin Oklahoma, has worked tirelessly since the bombing to uncover the true story.In 1996 the New York Times Company bought her television station and stopped herreports, but she has continued to uncover devastating information. She hasestablished that more than 70 witnesses saw McVeigh with other men and that morethan 20 of these sightings involved men with Middle Eastern features. A sketchof a man with “olive skin” seen with McVeigh was released by the FBI immediatelyafter the bombing and he became known as “John Doe 2”. But the FBI has withheldat least 12 surveillance camera videos showing what happened and who was therethat morning, and 1,034 fingerprints taken by the FBI have never been checked.23Jayna Davis’ lawyer is David Schippers, who led the impeachment proceedingsagainst Bill Clinton and represents FBI agents who had their investigations intoterrorist suspects blocked by their superiors before 9/11. Schippers said of theFBI’s manipulation of witness evidence relating to Oklahoma:> “Some of these people who gave affidavits were interviewed by the FBI during> the course of the investigation. They were interviewed about the second person> they saw and the agents tried to make them say that the second person was> Nichols. Every single one of these people said absolutely not, it was a Middle> Eastern type individual. Now, listen to this, none of those 302s, none of> those investigative reports, have ever surfaced.” 24Jayna Davis has produced a detailed dossier and interviewed witnesses who havesaid they will testify that they saw McVeigh with a former Iraqi soldier wholived in Oklahoma City at the time of the bombing. This man surrendered duringthe Gulf War and was resettled in the United States from a detention camp inSaudi Arabia.25 Immediately after the blast, the FBI put out an All-PointsBulletin for Middle Eastern-looking suspects seen fleeing the scene in a brownChevrolet pickup with tinted windows and a bug shield.26 As James Patterson, aneditorial writer on the Indianapolis Star, remarked: “Something here doesn’tpass the smell test.” 27 The FBI has refused to release the videotapes collectedfrom surveillance cameras around the Murrah Building because they are “part ofthe investigation” (the traditional excuse), but TV reporter Brad Edwardslocated a source who had seen parts of them. Edwards presented a reconstructionfor viewers on News Channel 4 of what his source claimed to have seen:> “The source said that the tapes show two men inside [the Ryder truck]. One> strongly resembling Timothy McVeigh gets out of the driver’s side, steps down,> he then appears to have dropped something on the step up into the truck. He> bends down and appears to pick something up off the step. Then he turns and> walks directly across this street towards the General Electric building. All> this time John Doe number two is still inside the Ryder truck’s cab sitting on> the passenger side. Time passes. The surveillance tape is time-lapse> photography. Without knowing exactly the time interval between shots our> source can’t be sure how long John Doe number two sat in that cab. What was he> doing all that time? Then the tape shows John Doe number two getting out of> the passenger side of the Ryder truck. Again the tape shows that a bombing> witness accurately described what happened next to News Channel 4 … the tape> shows John Doe two getting out, shutting the passenger side door. He steps> towards the front of the truck and is momentarily out of the frame of the> surveillance camera. But shortly he appears back in frame walking towards the> rear of the truck, still on the sidewalk in the front of the Murrah Building.”> 28The source said that “John Doe” wore a baseball cap, was taller than the manresembling McVeigh, and had an olive complexion. This was supported by manywitnesses, including a man interviewed with a blacked-out face and featured inthe report by Brad Edwards:> “I was standing in the building and I looked out the window and I seen the> Ryder truck and I seen a man get out of the Ryder truck. He was olive> complexion and he was … he had black curly hair. He was wearing a baseball cap> but his curls were sticking out of his hat. It was very short in the back but> you could still see the curls in his hair. He was not American, he was> foreign, you could tell by his skin, his face, and the way his face was …”Senator Charles Key, who helped to produce a report on Oklahoma, said hisunderstanding was that there is a video showing McVeigh and John Doe 2 gettingout of the Ryder Truck and into another pick up. “Where is that video … are wegoing to get to see it?” he asks. Er, you must be joking, the FBI replies.Incidentally I was on a radio show in America in May 2002 talking about the waythe FBI had refused to release these surveillance camera tapes. A former FBIagent came on the line saying loudly and vehemently that he worked on the caseand there were no surveillance tapes. It took a member of the public to come ontell him that not only did the tapes exist, the FBI had admitted this on thenational news! In 2001 the FBI said it was not going to release the tapes at allbecause of “national security” (the security of the official lie). When McVeighwent on trial the FBI did not use the tapes in prosecution because they wouldhave destroyed its story. If only McVeigh and no one else had been on the tapes,the world would have seen them within hours of the blast. Rule number one ofcover stories: if letting the public see something would support your coverstory you let them see it. If the public seeing something would destroy yourcover story you don’t let them see it. Surveillance cameras are part of theIlluminati system of control, but they are also a problem for them when theycarry out their public operations. Therefore we have a clear red flag test onthese occasions – are we allowed to see the surveillance camera tapes of thescene in question? There are 17 surveillance cameras working 24 hours a dayalong the route of the last journey taken by Princess Diana between the RitzHotel and the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in Paris. But at that time, of all times,every single one of the 17 cameras was “not working” – or so we are told. JamesPatterson of the Indianapolis Star wrote that critical evidence that severalMiddle Eastern men may have been connected to the Oklahoma bombing appeared tohave been kept from the public by the FBI. He added:> “Officially, the FBI has dismissed the possibility of a John Doe No. 2, an> olive-skinned man whose sketch they released immediately after the bombing, or> other suspects. But current and former FBI agents in Oklahoma City say they> received documents pointing to another person or even a cell of Middle Eastern> operatives. At a minimum, Congress should question one former FBI agent who> says he obtained 22 affidavits and more than 30 witness statements describing> sightings of Middle Easterners with McVeigh.” 29Hoppy Heidelberg, a prominent Oklahoma horse breeder, was dismissed from thegrand jury “investigating” the case when he went public with his complaints thatthe “investigation” was a sham. He said he was not allowed to ask for witnesses,even though it was his lawful right, and one of the areas he wanted to explorewas the reports of the “John Doe 2”. He said he was visited by FBI agentsbrandishing guns who said that if he knew what was good for him he would shutup. Apparently state, local and federal police detained dozens of Middle Easternmen after the bombing as they tried to leave the United States, and theseincluded “former” members of the Iraqi Republican Guard. It has been reportedthat in their possession were bomb-making materials, but President Clintoninsisted they were released. David Schippers, the Chief Investigative Counselfor the House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Hearing of Bill Clinton, said thatthe same team that carried out the Oklahoma bombing also carried out theSeptember 11th attacks. He said that he understood a former Iraqi RepublicanGuard officer called Al-Hussaini Hussain, who had been mentioned by reporterJayna Davis as a possible John Doe 2 in her investigations into Oklahoma, laterworked at Boston Logan Airport where two of the 9/11 flights took off.30 LarryJohnson, a former Deputy Director of the State Department’s Office onCounterterrorism, told Fox News the same. He said he believed that Al-HussainiHussain was John Doe 2 in Oklahoma and he added: “The thing that really concernsme relative to 9/11 [is that] when he left Oklahoma around 1996 and 1997, hewent to work at Logan Airport in Boston. We don’t know where he is now.”31 JaynaDavis has testified under oath before a grand jury, and in 1997 she attempted tohand over a large part of her evidence to the FBI, but those in control were notinterested.32 They have shown a similar lack of interest when offeredinformation about Osama bin Laden, which would have dismantled the officialstory. Former FBI agent Dan Vogel offered to testify at a hearing of TerryNichols, the man convicted with McVeigh, that he had received from Jayna Davis22 affidavits from witnesses who had seen McVeigh with Middle Eastern men in themonths, weeks and days before the attack and on the morning it happened. Hewanted to testify that he had sent the package to FBI agent Henry C. Gibbons,but the witness statements were not made public. However, Judge Linder ruledthat Vogel could not make this devastating testimony because the [In]JusticeDepartment did not want the evidence to be heard and would not authorise thetestimony.33Waco revisitedThe FBI and the ATF were, with others, responsible for the mass murder of men,women and children at Waco, Texas, on April 19th 1993. If they had something onDavid Koresh, the leader of the Branch Davidians, they could have arrested himmonths earlier when he often left the compound. But these people are mentallydisturbed and the plan was for a ritual murder by fire. Adolf Hitler and theNazis, who were serious black occultists (see my previous books) chose the sameday, April 19th, to burn the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw in 1943. The Nazis torchedthe ghetto block by block and then flooded and smoke-bombed the sewers when theJews tried to use them to escape. What the ATF and FBI did at Waco was virtuallyidentical. According to the occult law followed so slavishly by the Illuminatiand their agents, April 19th and 20th are dedicated to their god Baal and demandblood sacrifice. The Columbine High School shooting at Littleton, Colorado, wason April 20th 1999 and also involved the ATF and the FBI; so did Oklahoma – onApril 19th. I cannot stress enough the obsession these people have with occultritual and I explore this in detail in The Biggest Secret. Two brilliantdocumentaries, Waco: The Rules of Engagement (1997) and Waco: A New Revelation(1999) devastatingly expose the mass murder by the FBI and ATF, and theinvolvement at the highest levels of the US government.34 The Rules ofEngagement won an Emmy for best investigative journalism. The follow-up, A NewRevelation, is actually narrated by former FBI Special Agent Dr FredericWhitehurst. It was Dr Whitehurst who exposed the criminal manipulation ofevidence and the stunning “incompetence” at the FBI crime laboratory. Thedocumentaries reveal how the authorities used “flash-bang” devices to start thefire that engulfed the Mount Carmel compound at Waco after filling the compoundwith high explosives and poisonous gas. The devices were found at all locationswhere the fires started, but were claimed to have been silencers and gun parts.They also show how “shape” charges were placed by military operatives at the topof a concrete walk-in-cooler that became a “bunker” where the women and childrensought to escape from the lethal concentrations of CS gas. The “shape” chargesblew a hole in the concrete roof, killed everyone inside, and caused the partialdisintegration and fusing together of some of the bodies of the women andchildren because of the pressure and heat from the blast. Military explosivesexpert General Benton Partin supports this version of events, and shape chargeshave also been identified by some researchers in relation to the Murrah Buildingin Oklahoma and the World Trade Center towers on September 11th. Gene Cullen, aCIA service officer, is among the sources that confirm how Delta Force, theelite (and brain dead) unit of the US military, was at the compound during the“siege”. Delta Force fired on anyone who tried to flee the compound through theonly escape route, and they either died this way or in the inferno. The FBIclaims to have tapes of the Davidians planning to set the compound alight, butthey have never produced them because they are lying. The FBI, the source of theofficial story of September 11th, has some very decent, dedicated people workingat the foot soldier levels. But the FBI and related agencies are controlledhigher up the pyramid by some of the most unbalanced and corrupt peoplecurrently resident on planet earth. What was the outcome for the FBI and ATFafter Waco? Their funding was increased. After Oklahoma? Same. After September11th? What do you think?The FBI, like the ATF, is a deeply corrupt organisation – and the FBI is thesource through which the official version of September 11th has been sold to theworld. The Illuminati elements within the United States government and others,not least the British, have a long and horrendous history of terrorist activity.They often use foreign front men to carry out the attacks, but it is they whoplan and orchestrate them. One example occurred on March 8th 1985 when Lebaneseintelligence operatives trained by the Reagan-Bush CIA exploded a car bomboutside a mosque in Beirut to assassinate Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, theShiite Muslim cleric who some believed to be the “spiritual” leader of theterrorist group Hezbollah. He survived, but more than 80 worshippers werekilled. Robert “Iran-Contra” McFarlane, Reagan’s National Security Adviser, saidthat the bombers “may have been trained by the US, but the individuals whocarried it out were rogue operatives” and the CIA in no way sanctioned orsupported the attack.35 Sure they didn’t and, by the way, spaghetti grows ontrees.Pearl HarborGeorge W. Bush called the events of September 11th “Our Pearl Harbor” and foronce he was right, although not in the way he wanted us to believe.Interestingly, months earlier a blockbuster movie had been released by Hollywoodamid massive promotion about this very attack by the Japanese Air Force on PearlHarbor, Hawaii, in 1941. It was the attack that took the United States into theSecond World War. To this day popular accounts of history portray PresidentFranklin Delano Roosevelt, a Bush family relative, as a man who “strove in vainto ward off war”.36 This is yet another gross misrepresentation. Both theRoosevelts and the Delanos are bloodline and I mentioned earlier that hisgrandfather, Warren Delano, was a major operator in the drug networks operatedby the Russell family, the founders of the Skull and Bones Society. Delano alsoworked in the drugs network of the British government in Asia, China and the FarEast in general. When Roosevelt was seeking re-election as president in 1940 herepeated the same mantra: “… while I am talking to you, mothers and fathers, Igive you one more assurance. I have said this before but I shall say it againand again and again; your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars!”37 He even had the nerve to add that: “You can therefore nail any talk aboutsending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth.” 38 This is what people wantedto hear and he was re-elected. Roosevelt, however, an Illuminati stooge to hisfingertips, knew that the sons and many daughters of America were going to waragain very soon. What he needed was an event of such magnitude that Americawould go to war while, at the same time, Roosevelt would be cleared of anyresponsibility for going back on his clear and constantly repeated pledge of theelection campaign. The Illuminati plan, long known by Roosevelt, was to engineeran attack on the United States that would so anger public opinion that peoplewould agree to go to war against the aggressor and join the European conflictalso. As a member of Woodrow Wilson’s administration in the First World War,Roosevelt would have been well schooled in manipulating public opinion withengineered events. In 1939, Senator P. Nye of North Dakota said that he had seena series of volumes called The Next War. These included one entitled Propagandain the Next War and these were written before there was any talk of a SecondWorld War. As Senator Nye revealed, the material included the plan formanipulating public opinion into accepting American involvement in anotherglobal conflict, which these documents revealed was coming. The propagandadocument, which originated in Britain, said:> “To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more> difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite> threat to America, a threat moreover, which will have to be brought home to> every citizen, before the Republic again take arms in an external quarrel …> “The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and> this might and probably would bring America in without much further ado. [My> emphasis.] At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our> propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great War, they succeeded in> embroiling the United States with Germany …> “Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be> entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must> clearly enunciate our belief in the Democratic form of government, and our> firm resolve to adhere to … the old Goddess of Democracy.” 39Sound familiar in the months since September 11th? The Council on ForeignRelations (CFR) is an Illuminati front in the United States formed and dominatedby the Rockefeller family. It is part of a web that includes the BilderbergGroup, Trilateral Commission, and the London-based Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. This network is described in detail in And The TruthShall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret. It was the Council on ForeignRelations that devised the plan to antagonise Japan to such a degree that itwould attack the United States. At the forefront of this was Roosevelt’sSecretary of War, Henry Stimson, a founder of the CFR. In his diary he wrote,“We face the delicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be surethat Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad overt move.” 40 TheCFR’s War and Peace Studies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt suggesting that aidbe given to China during her conflict with Japan and that Japanese assets in theUS be frozen, a trade embargo imposed and Japan refused access to the PanamaCanal. I can recommend an excellent book called Pearl Harbor, The Story of theSecret War, by George Morgenstern, which sets out how the Japanese were goadedinto the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941.41 Roosevelt, an Illuminatibloodline wholly owned by the Council on Foreign Relations, set about provokingJapan into an attack with a number of measures, including the targeting ofJapanese oil supplies. For four years before the attack the Rooseveltadministration had been intercepting and decoding secret Japanese messages. Theyknew that the Japanese intended to alert their diplomatic centres around theworld of a decision to go to war through a false weather report during the dailyJapanese-language short-wave news broadcast. The forecast of “east wind rain”indicated war with the United States; “west wind clear” would mean a decision togo to war with Britain, and British and Dutch colonies in the east; “north windcloudy” meant war with Russia.As a Congressional investigation heard in 1945, the messages indicating adecision to go to war with the United States and Britain, though not withRussia, were intercepted and decoded on December 3rd 1941 – four days beforePearl Harbor.42 These messages subsequently went “missing” from Navy files.Other decoded messages gave Roosevelt prior warning of the attack, but thepublic were not told and nor were the sitting targets in Hawaii. On January 27th1941, Joseph Grew, the US Ambassador to Tokyo, had written to Roosevelt to saythat in the event of war, Pearl Harbor would be the first target.43 In all,Roosevelt had information from eight different sources indicating a probableattack.44 The historian Robert Stinnett revealed the results of 17 years ofresearch into the Pearl Harbor conspiracy in his book, Day of Deceit: The TruthAbout FDR and Pearl Harbor 45 His research included more than a milliondocuments obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which show thatknowledge of the Japanese plans was kept from commanders in Hawaii – the verysame men who were later made scapegoats for what happened. Stinnett uncovered amemo written on October 7th 1940 by Lt Commander Arthur McCollum, who headed theFar East section of US Naval Intelligence. McCollum confirms the policy ofsystematically provoking the Japanese to attack the United States in order toprovide the political and public motivation for the declaration of war. Theattack was purely to manipulate American public opinion into agreeing to takepart in another Illuminati war that had long been planned, and no one was moreduped than the Japanese. They had been tricked into attacking the US both by theAmericans and the Germans. The German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop,had been pressing the Japanese to attack the United States. On December 6th 1941Hitler had added to the Japanese resolve by indicating that German forces wereabout to enter Moscow. On December 8th, the day after Pearl Harbor, the Germanswere found to be in retreat from the Russian front. More than 3,000 people werekilled at Pearl Harbor, about the same as the official death toll on September11th, and they were yet more victims of the Illuminati agenda. The day afterPearl Harbor, Allen Dulles, an Illuminati agent, Hitler supporter and cousin tothe Rockefellers, was appointed to the staff of the Office of the Coordinator ofInformation. This later became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and thenthe CIA. It was he who was sacked by John F. Kennedy as head of the CIA and thenserved on the Warren Commission to “investigate” the JFK assassination. ThePearl Harbor plan worked brilliantly as public opinion reacted exactly asrequired to the attack on American soil. The United States was involved inanother war in Europe and “our boys” who, according to Roosevelt, were not goingto be sent into another European conflict, were now on their way, many of themto die. Winston Churchill, the Illuminati bloodline Prime Minister in Britainand a relative of Roosevelt and the Bushes, said of the news: “That is what Ihave dreamed of, aimed at, and worked for, and now it has come to pass”.46 Hemight have added: “and I always knew it was going to”. The influence onRoosevelt of the Council on Foreign Relations, with its membership throughoutthe government, banking, commerce, media and military, cannot be overestimated.Roosevelt’s son-in-law, Curtis Dall, said:> “For a long time I felt that [Roosevelt] … had developed many thoughts and> ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn’t. Most> of his thoughts, his political ‘ammunition’, as it were, were carefully> manufactured for him in advance by the Council on Foreign Relations – One> World Money Group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of> artillery, he exploded that ‘ammunition’ in the middle of on unsuspecting> target, the American people – and thus paid off and retained his> internationalist support.” 47The Roosevelt mansion on East 65th Street in New York was actually next door tothe Council on Foreign Relations and it was a committee known as the InformalAgenda Group, packed with members of the CFR, which wrote the proposal for theUnited Nations and handed it to Roosevelt who made it public on June 16th 1944as if he was the architect.48 Henry Louis Mencken writes in The AmericanLanguage49 that the term “United Nations” was first mentioned by Roosevelt in ameeting with Churchill at the White House in December 1941 – the month of PearlHarbor.50 Some 74 members of the Council on Foreign Relations were in the USdelegation at the founding meeting of the United Nations, which was created fromthe start as a vehicle for eventual world government. The Rockefellers donatedthe land on which the UN building in Manhattan is built, as they did the site ofthe headquarters of the earlier League of Nations in Switzerland. This was theirfirst attempt to create a stalking horse for the global centralisation ofpolitical power. The Rockefellers were also responsible for the building of twoother famous buildings in Manhattan … the twin towers of the World Trade Center.The Council on Foreign Relations, founded in 1921, has its members in keypositions throughout the US government, military, and media today, and many ofthe people telling us what happened on September 11th and who was responsibleare from the ranks of the CFR – just as they were with Pearl Harbor, theOklahoma bombing and so many other problem-reaction-solutions of the last 80years.Operation NorthwoodsIn April 2001, just four months before September 11th, a book was published byJames Bamford, who was formerly the Washington Investigative Producer for WorldNews Tonight with Peter Jennings on ABC Television. It was called Body ofSecrets 51 and revealed a plan hatched 40 years ago by America’s top militaryleaders, the Joints Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, to commit acts of terrorismin US cities, kill civilians and blame it on the Cuban president Fidel Castro.The plan was called Operation Northwoods, and was designed to win public andinternational support for an invasion of Cuba that would remove Castro. Bamfordquotes military leaders as writing: “We could blow up a US ship in GuantanamoBay and blame Cuba”, and “casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpfulwave of national indignation”. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also proposed to killthe astronaut John Glenn during the first attempt to put an American into orbitand blame that on Cuba, the documents reveal. If Glenn’s rocket exploded, “theobjective is to provide irrevocable proof … that the fault lies with theCommunists et all Cuba [sic],” say the Northwood documents. Bamford writes:> “ … the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member> of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on> American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the> high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington DC,> Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit;> planes would be hijacked. Using phoney evidence, all of it would be blamed on> Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer [the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and> his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they> needed to launch their war.” 52The plan was to stir up so much hatred for Cuba in the United States that thepeople would support an invasion and even demand that this was done. Theyintended to explode plastic bombs, arrest Cuban agents and release previouslyprepared documents falsely substantiating Cuban involvement. The plan includedattacks on the now infamous US base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba where, since theinvasion of Afghanistan, the “Land of Freedom” has kept untried and uncharged“terrorists” in disgraceful, inhuman, conditions. These attacks on the basewould be blamed on Castro. The documents speak of “a series of well co-ordinatedincidents … in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done byhostile Cuban forces”.53 A Memorandum of July 27th 1962 says that the operationwould mean an enormous increase in Cuban and American casualties.54 Thetechniques to be used included: starting rumours; using clandestine radio;landing friendly Cubans in uniform “over the fence” to stage “attacks” on thebase; capturing (friendly) Cuban saboteurs inside the base; starting riots nearthe base main gate using friendly Cubans; blowing up ammunition inside the baseand starting fires; burning aircraft on the base and blaming Cuba; throwingmortar shells into the base; capturing assault teams approaching from the sea orGuantanamo City; capturing a militia group which storms the base to sabotage aship in harbour; sinking a ship near the harbour entrance; blowing up anunmanned vessel in Cuban water and blaming it on Cuban aircraft that wouldnaturally come and investigate what had happened; issue false casualty lists tothe US media to whip up public opinion against Cuba; and, look at this …“conduct funerals for mock victims.” 55The Northwoods documents also call for the use of Soviet Union MIG-typelookalike aircraft flown by US pilots to harass civil aircraft, attack surfaceshipping and destroy US military “drone” (remotely controlled) aircraft to givethe impression it was all done by Communists. “An F-86 properly painted wouldconvince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG …” one document says.56 It wasfurther planned to stage the mock shooting-down of a US Air Force plane ininternational waters by simply getting the pilot, using a made-up name, toreport that he was under attack and then stop transmitting. He would then flyback to his base where the plane would be repainted with a new tail number andthe pilot would resume his real name. A US submarine would send aircraft tosearch for wreckage in the sea and this would be found to confirm the attack andblame it on Cuba. James Bamford’s book is a history of the biggest intelligenceoperation in America, the National Security Agency (NSA), which makes the CIAlook like a whimpering poodle. Bamford says the NSA was not involved inOperation Northwoods, but I don’t agree. I don’t buy the “it was just thePentagon” line at all. Of course the NSA would be involved in such an operation,as it would have been in 9/11. Bamford says the plans for these terrorist actsagainst American targets had the written approval of all the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, headed by Eisenhower’s appointee, Army General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, andwere presented by Robert McNamara, the [Illuminati] Defense Secretary, toPresident Kennedy in March 1962. Eventually the “civilian leadership” rejectedthem and three days later President Kennedy told Lemnitzer there was virtuallyno chance of ever using overt force to take Cuba. Operation Northwoods remainedsecret for 40 years until these documents came to light. Bamford told his formeremployers at ABC News:> “These were Joint Chiefs of Staff documents. The reason these were held secret> for so long is the Joint Chiefs never wanted to give these up because they> were so embarrassing. The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders> responding to the public will, and here this is the complete reverse, the> military trying to trick the American people into a war that they want but> that nobody else wants.” 57Why, one is right to wonder, do they allow the public to hear of this these onlymonths before a very similar plan unfolded on September 11th 2001? Bamfordwrites that even after the original plans were rejected, others continued to bedeveloped, such as creating a war between Cuba and another Latin Americancountry that would allow the US to intervene. It is no good people claimingtheir leaders could not have been behind the horrors of 9/11 when the documentsexist to show that the Pentagon had planned in detail something very similar 40years ago. And wait for this … Operation Northwoods also planned the hijackingof civil aircraft. The documents say it was possible to create an incident thatwould convince the people that the Cuban aircraft had shot down a charteredcivil airliner on a flight from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala,Venezuela or Panama. The destination would be chosen so the route would crossCuba and the plan was to replace the civil airliner with an identical oneremotely controlled from the ground and painted in the same colours. The realplane would be landed at an Air Force base and the passengers, boarded underaliases, would be taken off. The remotely controlled replacement would then beflown over Cuba, send a distress signal and be destroyed by radio signal. Andall this was planned 40 years ago. Imagine what the technology is like today bycomparison? James Bamford writes in Body of Secrets:> “An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate> for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in> the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for> the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers,> all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft> would be converted into a drone [a remotely controlled unmanned aircraft].> Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled> to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.> “From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to> minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Elgin AFB where> arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the> aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to> fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on> the international distress frequency a “May Day” message stating he is under> attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by> destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This> will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organisation] radio stations in> the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what has happened to the aircraft> instead of the US trying to ‘sell’ the incident.”Forty years later, in New York and Washington, something remarkably similarhappened on 9/11 and, for Fidel Castro, read Osama bin Laden. Also it wasclearly possible 40 years ago for transmissions to be made from an aircraft inwhich there were no pilots or passengers on board. You can see from theseexamples, and I could quote so many more, that the problem-reaction-solutiontechniques that were employed on September 11th are nothing new. Like I say, ifit keeps working, why change it?SOURCES > 1H.R. 2580> 2http://www.rense.com/general17/fly.htm> [http://www.rense.com/general17/fly.htm]> 3MSNBC, video streaming, June 11th 2001; see also> http://www.skolnicksreport.com/claffair2.html> [http://www.skolnicksreport.com/claffair2.html]> 4Oklahoma City Bombing, Expert Analysis:> http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma_bombing_expert_analysis.html> [http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma_bombing_expert_analysis.html]> 5http://www.brasscheck.com/OKBOMB [http://www.brasscheck.com/OKBOMB]> 6Oklahoma City Bombing, Expert Analysis:> http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma_bombing_expert_analysis.html> [http://www.cowan70.freeserve.co.uk/miscellaneous/oklahoma_bombing_expert_analysis.html]> 7Case Study Relating Blast Effects to the Events of April 19, 1995.

This becomes obvious whenyou observe both the attacks and their aftermath. In this chapter I will outlinethe official story of what happened and the response that followed. I shouldstress that many of the “facts” in this official version depend on whichspokesman or agency you speak to because they often contradict each other.The US government and its “security” agencies like the CIA and FBI say they hadno idea that a terrorist attack was planned on that beautiful east coast morningas tens of thousands of people began their working day in the office complexesof Manhattan and at the headquarters of the American military at the Pentagon inWashington DC. These “security” agencies employ together perhaps 100,000 peoplein the United States and worldwide, and devour some $35 billion from UStaxpayers every year (and that’s only the official funds). Yet they claim not tohave uncovered one single piece of information to suggest that some “19 Arabterrorists” (part of a network of perhaps 50, it is suggested) were planning tosimultaneously hijack four US commercial aircraft in American airspace and crashthem into the very symbols of US military and financial power. The first theyknew, so the story goes, was when it was far too late to respond. That is anoutrageous lie to be filed with all the rest and has been revealed as such.The ProblemAt 7.59am that Tuesday morning, American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767, tookoff from Logan International Airport in Boston heading for Los Angeles. On boardwere 81 passengers, two pilots and nine flight attendants. Following along therunway soon afterwards was United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, whichdeparted at 8.14am, also for LA. It was carrying 56 passengers, two pilots andseven flight attendants. At 8.01am, and 150 miles to the south, United AirlinesFlight 93 pulled back from the gate at Newark, New Jersey, and the Boeing 757began its routine journey across America to San Francisco with 38 passengers,two pilots and five attendants. But for some reason, which United Airlines couldnot explain when I asked them, the take-off was delayed and it did not leave theground until 8.42. Meanwhile, at 8.10, American Airlines Flight 77 leftWashington’s Dulles International Airport for Los Angeles with 58 passengers,two pilots and four attendants aboard a Boeing 757.American Airlines flight 11image [../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 10: The course of Flight 11 according to aircraft tracking company FlightExplorer The official story claims that shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 tookoff from Boston at 7.59 bound for Los Angeles, Arab terrorists hijacked theplane using small knives and box cutters. The pilot and co-pilot of Flight 11were John Ogonowski and Tom McGuinness, a former F-14 Navy Tomcat pilotdescribed as “big and burly”. Around 14 minutes into the flight they wereinstructed by air traffic control to make a 20-degree turn to the right,according to a “federal official familiar with transcripts of theair-traffic-control conversations of all four flights”.1 The pilot replied inthe normal way of ground to air communications by repeating the instruction andgiving the flight code: “20 right, AAL11”. Very soon after this, the pilot wasasked to climb to 35,000 feet, but there was no response. The following isclaimed to be a transcript of the exchange that took place at about 8.13am, 14minutes into the flight:> Boston Control Center: “AAL11 turn 20 degrees right.”> AAL11: “20 right AAL11.”> Controller A: “AAL11 now climb maintain FL350 [35,000 feet].”> Controller A: “AAL11 climb maintain FL350.”> Controller A: “AAL11 Boston.”> Controller A: “AAL11, ah, the American on the frequency how do you hear me?”> Controller B breaks in: “This is Athens.”> Controller A: “This is Boston. I turned American 20 left and I was going to> climb him; he will not respond to me now at all.”> Controller B: “Looks like he’s turning right.”> Controller A: “Yeah, I turned him right.”> Controller B: “Oh, O.K.”> Controller A: “And he’s only going to, um, I think 29.”> Controller B: “Sure that’s fine.”> Controller A: “Eh, but I’m not talking to him.”> Controller B: “He won’t answer you. He’s nordo [no radar] roger. Thanks.” 2So the first sign of a problem that morning was shortly after 8.13am and it isclaimed that only at 8.40 – 27 minutes later – did the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) inform NORAD, which guards North American airspace, thatFlight 11 had been hijacked. Why? We shall see that this is against allprocedures detailed in the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagoninstruction manuals. The FAA is the civilian government operation that runs theair traffic system in the United States while NORAD, the North AmericanAerospace Defense Command, is an American and Canadian military organisationthat is supposed to protect North America against attacks by “aircraft,missiles, or space vehicles … ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of theairspace of Canada and the United States”.3 I will have a great deal more to sayabout these organisations in due course. It is claimed that after contact waslost with Flight 11, a controller heard a voice from the cockpit at 8.24am thatsaid: “We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returningto the airport. Nobody move.” The controller is said to have replied: “Who’strying to call me?” But there was no response. Another “radio transmission” saidto have been heard by controllers at 8.33am was: “Nobody move please. We aregoing back to the airport. Don’t try to make any stupid moves.” Two minuteslater another instruction is said to have been: “Everything will be OK. If youtry to make any moves, you’ll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stayquiet.” If that’s true, the pilots had time to switch on the microphone in thecockpit, which, the official version says, allowed air traffic controllers tohear the hijackers. Either that or the hijackers were confusing the aircraftradio with the intercom. Strangely, the secret four-digit alert code that warnsthe ground that a plane has been hijacked was never sent and that’s the firstthing a pilot is supposed to do in such circumstances. It was the same storywith all four aircraft. There was only one other contact between Flight 11 andair traffic control, the official story goes. That was when controllers wereasked for a route, or air corridor, to JFK Airport in New York, although by whomis not stated by officials. I asked the media office of the Federal AviationAdministration who in the cockpit made this request and they said they did nothave that information. Why? The transponder, or IFF beacon, which allows anaircraft to be more easily tracked on radar and supplies other information, wasswitched off at 8.20 over the Hudson River and the plane turned sharply andheaded for New York. Losing the transponder would have made it harder to trackthe plane, but, I emphasise, it was still very much trackable by conventionalradar.“Attendants call from plane”We are told that flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney, a 35-year-old mother oftwo, made a call from the plane to American Airlines Flight Services ManagerMichael Woodward at Boston Logan Airport and said there were four hijackers onboard (the FBI claims there were five). She said they had stabbed two flightattendants, we are told. She is claimed to have said: “A hijacker cut the throatof a business class passenger and he appears to be dead.” The terrorists,Sweeney said, “had just gained access to the cockpit.” 4 This begs the questionof why the pilots had not sent the hijack code if things were happening on theplane before the hijackers gained access to the cockpit. The FBI report to themedia on this alleged conversation says that even as Sweeney was relatingdetails about the hijackers to Woodward, the men were storming the front of theplane. I ask again: if all hell was breaking lose in the plane and passengerswere being attacked why no hijack code from the cockpit and why wasn’t thecockpit door immediately secured from the inside? According to Woodward, whenthe plane changed direction and began to descend Sweeney called the cockpit, butthere was no reply. Sweeney is said to have told Woodward the seat numbers ofthe hijackers and that the plane was going down. Her final words were given as:“I see water and buildings. Oh my God. Oh my God.” American Airlines laterreleased an account of a conversation it says took place during the flightbetween attendant Betty Ong and airline officials. They say that Ong pressednumber 8 on a seatback GTE Airfone and got through to an American Airlinesreservations agent who called the system operations control centre in FortWorth, Texas. The time was 8.27am, around 12 minutes after the cockpit firstfailed to respond to air traffic instructions. Craig Marquis, the manager onduty, said that Betty Ong told him that two flight attendants had been stabbedand one was being given oxygen. A passenger had been slashed in the throat andlooked dead and the hijackers were in the cockpit. She said that the passengershad been sprayed with something that made her eyes burn and she was havingdifficulty breathing. She said there were four hijackers (again not the five theFBI claims) and she said they were in the first-class seats, 2A, 2B, 9A, and 9B.These numbers were slightly different to those given by the other attendant,Madeline Amy Sweeney, and both were different to those given by the FBI. I askedthe FBI why there was such a discrepancy, but they said they could not answerquestions because of the “ongoing investigation” and I would have to applythrough the Freedom of Information Act in years to come to find the informationI wanted! (See Appendix 1 [../Text/index_split_028.html#filepos1972322] and 2[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos1986971].) Betty Ong is claimed to havesaid that the wounded passenger was in seat 10B. Marquis asked Betty Ong if theplane was descending. “We’re starting to descend. We’re starting to escend,” sheis said to have replied. At 8.46am, 48 minutes after leaving Boston, Flight 11crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at the 96th of the 110floors.The FBI later listed five hijackers on Flight 11, thus ignoring the fact thatcalls, apparently from two separate flight attendants actually on the flight,both said four. I will use the names and spellings from the indictment ofZacarias Moussaoui, who was accused of involvement in the planning of theattacks. The indictment relates to his appearance before the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, inDecember 2001. Among those named by the FBI as a hijacker of Flight 11 wasMohamed Atta, an Egyptian, who it says was at the controls when the plane struckthe World Trade Center. The FBI also claims he was the overall leader of the9/11 terrorists. The other hijackers on Flight 11 were named on the indictmentas Satam al-Suqami, from the United Arab Emirates, and Abdul Alomari, Wailal-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri, all from Saudi Arabia. Al-Suqami, the FBI tellsus, was the only one of the five who was not a trained pilot.United Airlines flight 175image [../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 11: The route of Flight 175 Captain Victor J. Saracini, aged 51, and 38-year-old first officer Michael R.Horrocks were at the controls of Flight 175 when it pushed back from Gate 19 atBoston’s Logan Airport. This was seven gates along from Flight 11, which hadleft from Gate 26 about 15 minutes earlier. The official stories of whathappened to the two planes are very similar. Flight 175 took off about 8.14amand nothing seemed amiss in the initial climb. At 8.37, with AA Flight 11 nowknown to be in trouble, a controller is said to have asked Saracini and Horrocksif they could see American Flight 11 ahead of them.> Controller: “Do you have traffic? Look at, uh, your twelve to one o’clock at> about, uh, ten miles south bound to see if you can see an American seventy six> seven out there please.”> UAL175: “Affirmative we have him, uh, he looks, uh, about twenty yeah about> twenty nine, twenty eight thousand.”> Controller: “United 175 turn five turn thirty degrees to the right I [want to]> keep you away from this traffic.” 5We are then told there were no further communications between the ground andFlight 175 until 8.41, that’s just five minutes before Flight 11 crashed intothe World Trade Center. At this time one of the pilots on Flight 175 is claimedto have called the controller and said, using the pilot code for Boston: “Weheard a suspicious transmission on our departure from B-O-S. Sounds like someonekeyed the mike and said, ‘Everyone stay in your seats’.” 6 Again I asked theFederal Aviation Administration for more information on this exchange, but theysaid they could not comment. Just 90 seconds after that exchange between cockpitand controller, Flight 175 veered off-course over northern New Jersey and headedsouth before turning back in a U-turn towards New York at some 400 miles anhour, aiming for the World Trade Center.7 That is just 90 seconds between noproblem and the plane being taken over by hijackers and flown off-course? Onceagain the transponder was switched off and there was no hijack code from thepilots, as with all four aircraft involved. Howard Dulmage, an aviation attorneyand pilot, said: “You think four times in one morning one of those crews wouldhave done that. That means they had to be upon them before they could react.” 8Well that’s one way of explaining it, anyway, but there are others. A femaleflight attendant is said to have spoken to a mechanic at an airline maintenancecentre in San Francisco that takes in-flight calls from attendants reportingitems that need replacing or repairing. The mechanic, we are told, reported theconversation about 8.50am to Rich “Doc” Miles, the manager of the UnitedAirlines System Operations Center in Chicago. He says the mechanic told him thatthe attendant had said: “Oh my God. The crew has been killed; a flight attendanthas been stabbed. We’ve been hijacked.” 9 The line then went dead. If this isall true then, according to the official timeline, the hijackers stormed thecockpit, killed the crew, took over the controls, a flight attendant rang theairline mechanic, and he called Rich “Doc” Miles to report what she said, all inthe space of around seven minutes. Messages were sent to the cockpit computerwithout reply. Passenger Peter Hanson, a software salesman, apparently used hiscellphone to ring his parents in Easton, Connecticut, at about 9am, some 45minutes after take-off, and said that hijackers with knives had taken over theplane and stabbed a stewardess. Soon after, he called again and before the linewas lost he is said to have told his father Lee that the plane was “going down”.Hanson’s wife Sue, son Peter, and their two-year-old daughter Christine werealso on the plane. Around this time, it is claimed, an unidentified stewardessrang an emergency number from the back of the plane and described how colleagueshad been stabbed. At 9.03am Flight 175 smashed into the south tower of the WorldTrade Center on live television amid a fireball that no one who saw it will everforget.The FBI says the hijackers of Flight 175 were led by Marwan al-Shehhi of theUnited Arab Emirates, a close friend and associate of Mohamed Atta. FBIstatements claim that Al-Shehhi piloted the aircraft into the south tower. Alsoon the plane, the FBI tells us, were Fayez Ahmed (also Banihammad Fayez) andMohald al-Shehri, both Saudis who had undergone flight training, and Ahmedal-Ghamdi and Hamza al-Ghamdi, also from Saudi Arabia.American Airlines flight 77image [../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 12: The USA Today version of the route of Flight 77 image [../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 13: The other version of Flight 77 published elsewhere in the media In the cockpit that morning as Flight 77 took off from Washington Dulles at8.20am were 51-year-old Captain Charles F. “Chic” Burlingame III and firstofficer David Charlebois, who was 39. Burlingame was a graduate of the “Top Gun”fighter pilot school and was such a perfectionist that one colleague said thathe would carry a set of small paint brushes to dust the instruments. He had onceworked at the Pentagon while a Navy reservist not far from where his flightwould crash that morning. His father was in the Navy and Air Force for 23 yearsand he and his wife are buried in the Arlington National Cemetery close to thePentagon. Among the passengers was a former American Airlines pilot calledWilson “Bud” Flagg, a retired Navy Admiral once posted to the Pentagon; BrianJack, a head of fiscal economics in the office of Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld at the Pentagon, where he had worked for 25 years; three engineers fromplane makers, Boeing; and Barbara Olson, wife of the US Solicitor General,Theodore “Ted” Olson, and a contributor to CNN.Flight Explorer is a company that tracks commercial flights in real time usingdata provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, and can be accessed on theInternet.10 There are, however, two published versions of the route of Flight77, both sourced to Flight Explorer. The version published in USA Today (Figure12) includes a very strange “loop” deviation from its course as it turned northover West Virginia, then west, before turning south and returning to itsauthorised route.11 This loop is not included in the course data published byother media organisations, and this serious deviation happened well before thetransponder was is said to have been turned off and the plane turned around tohead back for Washington. If this did happen, what on earth were the air trafficcontrollers doing in that time and what was the reason given by the cockpitbefore the aircraft returned to its agreed route? I asked the Federal AviationAdministration that very question, but it wouldn’t comment. I contacted FlightExplorer to ask for confirmation that the USA Today version was correct and Iwas sent the route in Figure 13. About 8.50am we are told that the cockpitstopped responding to controllers and six minutes later the transponder wasturned off. A controller is said to have called the aircraft repeatedly asking:“American 77 indy radio check, how do you read?” At 9.02am, still nearly 40minutes before impact, a controller is said to have told American Airlines: “Welost track control of the guy, he’s in coast track [no transponder] but wehaven’t – we don’t really know where his target is and we can’t get a hold ofhim.” 12 An “unidentified” aircraft was then picked up on radar headed forWashington at some 500 miles an hour. Some reports say that a military C130(Golfer 06) took off from the Andrews Air Force Base near Washington to identifythe plane and reported it was a Boeing 767 (it was a 757) moving low and veryfast. This was Flight 77, we are told, with the Pentagon as its target.It is said that one of the terrorists told the passengers that they were goingto die and they should phone their families. We are told that former federalprosecutor and CNN contributor Barbara Olson rang her husband, Ted Olson, USSolicitor General, at his office in the Justice Department at about 9.25,according to media reports. Olson says he was watching television coverage ofthe World Trade Center when his secretary told him: “Your wife is on the phone.”Olson said that Barbara, his third wife, told him that her plane had beenhijacked using box cutters and knives. She said nothing about the number ofhijackers or their nationality.13 There appear to be several published versionsof their conversation and in one she said the pilots were with her. Ted Olsontold her about the World Trade Center and she said: “What should I tell thepilot?” before the line went down. Olson said he called the Justice Departmentcommand centre who told him they had no idea the plane had been hijacked. Hiswife rang back and said the plane was circling, but the line was lost again, hesaid.14 Olson was the lawyer who argued the case before the Supreme Court forGeorge W. Bush to be elected president after the Florida fiasco and has been avehement advocate of Bush’s anti-terrorism laws since September 11th. On March17th 2002, Ted Olson was defending the United States before the Supreme Courtagainst charges of murder by the CIA. Olson said that day:> “It’s easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government> might legitimately give out false information. It’s an unfortunate reality> that the issuance of incomplete information and even misinformation by> government may sometimes be perceived as necessary to protect vital> interests.”By 9.42, some 80 minutes after take-off, Flight 77 was seen approachingWashington DC, it is claimed. The plane is said to have made a sharp turn anddescended very steeply from 7,000 feet to near surface level. It is reported tohave crossed a highway, clipping street lamps, before striking a helicopter padand exploding into a five-storey section of the Pentagon, one of the world’sbiggest buildings, at 9.43. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was in an officeat the opposite end of the building to the impact and such is the size of thePentagon he felt only a “jarring thing”. A total of 190 people died in the planeand the Pentagon, we are told. The FBI announced to the media that fivehijackers were on board Flight 77 led by Hani Hanjour. He had a commercialpilot’s license and was said at first to have been at the controls when theplane struck the Pentagon until it was clear from his flight instructors that hewas a terrible pilot even in small planes. He is a Saudi and so were the othersnamed by the FBI as being on the plane. They were Majed Moqed, Salem al-Hamzi,Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hamzi. The latter two were the only accused whoappeared on the terrorist alert list.United Airlines flight 93image [../Images/00016.jpg]Figure 14: The route of Flight 93 Flight 93 left Gate 17 at Newark International Airport at 8.01am, bound for SanFrancisco, and took off at 8.42am after a long and unexplained delay. At thecontrols were the 43-year-old captain Jason Dahl, from Littleton, Colorado, andthe 36-year-old first officer LeRoy Homer of Marlton, New Jersey. They flew westover Pennsylvania and into northern Ohio where they received a message fromUnited Airlines warning all pilots of a potential “cockpit intrusion”. Thecockpit of Flight 93 confirmed receipt of the message and because of its latedeparture this was the only one of the four planes that had prior warning ofpossible trouble. It is said that Flight 93 was hijacked some 30 minutes aftertake off, that’s around 9.10am, and after the two planes had crashed into theWorld Trade Center. We are told it was 9.16 when the Federal AviationAdministration told its military colleagues at NORAD that Flight 93 may havebeen hijacked, but the official story says that it was not until 9.40 that thetransponder signal was lost. The hijackers are said to have forced their wayinto the cockpit wearing red bandanas around their heads and one of them warnedhe had a bomb attached to his waist. The official version says the hijackerstold the passengers they were taking the plane to another airport. Air trafficcontrollers apparently claim that they heard two short radio transmissionsaround the time the “cockpit was stormed” and in one they heard a pilot say:“Get out of here”. An unnamed government official quoted in the media said therewere at least four radio transmissions in which the phrases “bomb on board”,“our demands” and “keep quiet” were heard.15 A lot of these allegedconversations remind me of a low-budget movie. ABC News claimed to have secureda tape of these transmissions in which a hijacker says: “We’d like you all toremain seated. There is a bomb on board. And we are going to turn back to theairport. And they had our demands, so please remain quiet.” 16 Passengers usedtheir cellphones and seat-back phones to call their friends and family, we aretold, and they heard about the planes crashing in New York and Washington. This,it is claimed, led to passengers getting together to challenge the fourhijackers, who were armed once again with small knives and box cutters, theofficial story goes. At 9.45 Todd Beamer, a 32-year-old employee of the computersoftware company Oracle, is said to have spoken to airphone supervisor LisaJefferson after his credit card was refused when he tried to call his family. Asummary of the 15-minute conversation was faxed by the Verizon phone company tohis wife in which he said that the pilot and co-pilot appeared to be dead andthe hijackers were flying the plane. But another passenger, Lauren Grandcolas,is reported to have phoned her husband Jack in San Francisco to say: “We havebeen hijacked. They are being kind. I love you.” 17 Beamer is said to havestated that one hijacker was guarding 27 passengers at the back of the aircraftwith what he was told was a bomb around his waist. He is reported to have saidthat two other hijackers were in the cockpit and another was guarding firstclass. Beamer sent love to his wife, who was five months pregnant, and his twosmall sons. The last words the phone supervisor is said to have heard him saywere: “Are you guy’s ready? Let’s roll.” 18 His wife Lisa, who never spoke tohim directly, said she recognised the phrase as one he used with their sons. Acontact that knows members of the Illuminati High Council in the United Statestold me that Verizon is a major Illuminati operation. At 9.42 Mark Bingham, a31-year-old rugby player and an enormous man at six feet five, called his motherAlice Hoglan from the plane. “Mom, this is Mark Bingham,” he said, sounding verynervous. “I want to let you know that I love you. I’m calling from the plane.We’ve been taken over. There are three men that say they have a bomb.” 19 TheFBI and Beamer said there were four. Jeremy Glick, a former national judochampion, talked to his wife, Liz, on an airphone and asked if it was true aboutplanes crashing into the World Trade Center. He said the passengers were takinga vote over whether they should try to take back the plane. “Honey, you need todo it,” she told him. Glick’s mother-in-law told CNN that he also called her andsaid that “one of the hijackers had a red box he said was a bomb and one had aknife of some nature”.20 She said he asked her if reports about attacks on theWorld Trade Center were true and she told him they were. He left the phone for awhile, she said, returning to say: “The men voted to attack the terrorists.”Thomas Burnett Jr, a 38-year-old father of three girls, called from the planefour times and in his last call he told his wife that they planned to challengethe hijackers. “I know we’re all going to die,” he told her, “There’s three ofus who are going to do something about it. I love you, honey.” 21 Flightattendant Sandy Bradshaw called her husband Phil, a US Airways pilot. “Have youheard what’s going on?” she said. “My flight has been hijacked. My flight hasbeen hijacked with three guys with knives.” Note again that the FBI says four,just as it names five for Flight 11 when the attendants were reported to havesaid four. Sandy said she was in the galley filling jugs with boiling water andshe ended: “Everyone’s running to first class. I’ve got to go. Bye.” 22 Theofficial version is that passengers attacked the hijackers and the plane smashedinto a field at Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 575 miles an hour. The time givenfor the crash varies considerably. NORAD, the official military defenders ofNorth American airspace, told me it happened at approximately 10.03, many otherreports say 10.10, and still others 10.37. This last time is some two hours and38 minutes after the first hijacked plane left Boston. By now thousands ofpeople were dead and the world was in trauma at the unspeakable horror of whathad happened. The FBI said the four hijackers on Flight 93 were Saeed al-Ghamdi,Ahmed al-Haznawi, Ahmed al-Nami, and Ziad Jarrah.Television brought the shocking scenes to hundreds of millions of people as thenorth tower burned from the collision with Flight 11. Then, 18 minutes later, aspeople were watching those pictures, Flight 175 careered into the south toweramid an enormous explosion of flame. It is estimated that some 20,000 peoplecould have been working in each of the towers at that time in the morning andthe official death toll was a little under three thousand. At 10am, less than anhour after the impact from Flight 175, the south tower collapsed as a horrifiedworld looked on. Half an hour later the north tower went the same way. Theofficial explanation for the imploding collapse was that the fuel fire hadweakened steel supports and the floors above the impact began to fall, creatingan ever more powerful chain reaction as floors crashed upon floors until thewhole building fell like some enormous house of cards. Among the dead were 341fire fighters together with other rescuers who had rushed into the buildings tohelp and been killed in the sudden collapse.The President and the pet goat storyPresident Bush was in Florida on the morning of September 11th for along-standing photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School atSarasota. The official story says that he began the day with a four and a halfmile jog, two laps of a golf course on Longboat Key.23 There are inexplicablyconflicting reports of what Bush did that morning and when he knew about thefirst plane to strike the World Trade Center. I will go into these strangeevents in Sarasota in some detail later. One of the official reports was thatBush was told about Flight 11 by his White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card onthe way to a classroom where he was scheduled to promote his “education”policy.24 The official tale is that Bush went to a private room and spoke on thephone with his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. We are told that atthis point the crash of Flight 11 could have been considered just a “terribleaccident”, but this is a lie, as we shall see. After hearing about Flight 11crashing into the north tower of the World Trade Center, President Bush acteddecisively. He went into the classroom to hear children reading a story about apet goat. Bush entered the classroom at about 9am with Education Secretary RonPaige and Florida Lieutenant Governor Frank Brogan. They paused for mediaphotographs and Bush sat down in front of the 18 children from the second grade.As the children read to him he said: “Really good readers – whew!” Bushinterrupted at one point, saying, “This must be Sixth Grade.” 25 This is a guywho has just been told that a commercial airliner has smashed into one of thetwo biggest buildings in America in the heart of downtown New York. Chief ofStaff Andrew Card then appeared in the classroom and whispered into Bush’s earto tell him about the crash of the second plane, Flight 175. This was thepicture seen all over the world along with headlines like: “The Moment BushKnew”. Yet still he stayed in the classroom listening to children reading abouta pet goat. It was only around 9.30 – 26 minutes after hearing of the secondcrash and some 45 after the first – that Bush reacted. He went into the schoollibrary to announce:> “Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes> have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on> our country. I am going to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down> and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will> not stand.” 26Those folks? Those folks? Bush’s behaviour that morning was, at the very least,criminally inept and incompetent, but it was more than that, as I shallhighlight later. Bush was taken to the presidential plane, Air Force One, and itwas naturally believed that he would head for Washington at this time of terrorand chaos for his country. Instead he embarked on a day-long tour of the skiesthat included stops at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, and the US StrategicCommand at Offutt Air Force base in Nebraska. He did not arrive in Washingtonuntil 7pm – ten hours after Andrew Card walked into the classroom and told himof the second crash. Even the official story says that Bush did not call VicePresident Cheney to put the US military on high alert status until 10 o’clockthat morning when he was in Air Force One. Between 9.05am when he was told ofthe second crash in New York and the moment when he picked up the phone to putthe US military on high alert status an astonishing 55 minutes had elapsed. Itwas in this period that Flight 77 crashed into an unprotected Pentagon. Whenunderstandable questions were being asked about Bush’s unexplained dash toLouisiana and on to Nebraska after his nation had suffered such a massiveterrorist attack, White House spokespeople said that they had received a phonecall giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was the next target. Likemost of the 9/11 story this turned out to be a solid gold lie and later had tobe admitted as such.I have seen reports that Father George Bush was in the White House with Cheneywhile the attacks were happening27 and an Air Force source also said that thiswas true. These reports say that Bush left Washington by private jet at 10amthat morning while other air traffic was being grounded. This is not that farfrom the official story, which says that he and wife Barbara were at the WhiteHouse the night before and flew out of Washington on the morning of 9/11. FatherBush told CNN that they were flying to St. Paul, Minneapolis, when the firstnews was flashed to their Secret Service detail about the attacks. Their planewas diverted to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and they were taken to a motel beyond thecity limits where they could only follow events on television like everyoneelse, it is claimed.28 If Father George Bush was not actively involved in eventsthen I have a seafront home in the Gobi Desert.Herr Blair hears the newsFrom the start, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair weresinging, as always, from the same song sheet. Blair was in Brighton on the southcoast of England when the World Trade Center was struck. He was due to make whatwas going to be a difficult and less than well-received speech to tradesunionists, but this was cancelled and he headed back by train for London.According to media reports, Blair called his Foreign and Defence Secretaries,Jack Straw and Geoff Hoon. The three agreed, the reports say, to build “… aninternational alliance which included the rest of Europe, Muslim nations, Chinaand Russia.” 29 But why would Blair and his yes-men do this immediately afterthe American attacks when they should have had no idea who was behind themaccording to the CIA and FBI? Not even the Americans had officially mentionedany suspects at that stage. We are talking of actions taken immediately afterthe attacks and Blair is already preparing for what became known as the “war onterrorism”. Back in London, Blair told a news conference that Britain wouldstand “shoulder to shoulder” with the United States. This was, in effect, ablank cheque speech, as events were to confirm. In the hours and days thatfollowed, the culprit or “patsy” was already being dusted down – Osama binLaden. His name would be repeated like a mantra by Bush, Powell and Blair untilhe became guilty, not by evidence, but by constant repetition. During his summerholiday a month before 9/11 Blair had read security reports on Osama bin Ladenand Islamic fundamentalism, and read parts of the Koran to “… try and understandaspects of the faith and fathom out whether a justification for terrorism couldreally be found, as often argued, in its pages”.30 What a coincidence.Once upon a time in fairyland …The television networks were naming Osama bin Laden as the likely culprit in thehours after the planes struck the World Trade Center and Colin Powell, theSecretary of State, first mentioned that Osama bin Laden was a “prime suspect”two days after 9/11. Powell told the media: “We are looking at those terroristorganisations who have the kind of capacity to conduct the kind of attack thatwe saw.” Really? Did he mean the CIA and the Pentagon? No, as it turns out.Asked whether he was referring to Osama bin Laden, he answered: “Yes.” Once binLaden’s name was in the ring, the “evidence” began to emerge in support of thetheory that the attack was carried out by extreme Islamic fundamentalists. Anofficial “investigation” was launched by two Bush family gofers: AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft and the two-weeks-in-the-job FBI chief, Robert Mueller.The FBI immediately named 19 Arab men as responsible for the hijackings. Thiswas remarkable in itself because this same agency, along with the CIA, had toldus it did not have even a glimmer of an idea that the biggest terrorist attackin American history was being put together for months before September 11th and,in Mueller’s words, almost certainly years. But now the names and pictures ofthose involved were suddenly produced. What fantastic detective work! Theproblem was, as we shall discuss later, that more than a third of the names onthe FBI “hijacker” list were found to be still alive! Maybe they parachuted justbefore impact? Anything becomes possible when the official story needs proppingup.The “biggest investigation in American history” with 4,000 officers and 3,000support personnel apparently deployed by the FBI alone was helped by somestaggering good fortune. This included the fact that the bag of “mastermind”Mohamed Atta failed to make it on to Flight 11 and this presented the FBI with“incriminating evidence” together with the contents of abandoned hire cars inairport car parks. The FBI said it found a Saudi passport, an internationaldriver’s license, a copy of the Koran, “some kind of religious tape”, and, yes,yes, a videotape on how to fly Boeing 757s and 747s.31 What a piece of luck. Buteven this was eclipsed by the miraculous find, widely reported in the media, ofa passport from one of the hijackers that was discovered in the street a fewblocks from the World Trade Center. Somehow, while some two thousand bodies havenever been found, a paper passport that had been in the pocket or bag of ahijacker had survived the impact of a commercial airliner at some 400 miles anhour and the fireball that followed. It had fallen from the plane and wafteddown to be found, still recognisable and identifiable, in the street. If that ispossible, maybe the still-alive hijackers did parachute after all. We were alsotold, again despite two thousand bodies disappearing without trace, that astewardess with her hands tied behind her back was discovered soon after theattacks – just as the official story was being heavily promoted.32The ReactionThese miracle finds and the constant repetition of the official story served tosupport the script to which Bush, Blair and their “teams” were all working. Arabhijackers had stormed the cockpits, the trained pilots among them had taken overthe controls, and the planes were deliberately aimed at their targets in a masssuicide and murder attack on America. What’s more, the hijackers were workingfor Osama bin Laden who was based in Afghanistan and protected by the Talibanregime. Once this cover story was established immediately after September 11thnothing was allowed to challenge its supremacy. This is how it was and this ishow it is. End of story. If you question anything we tell you then clearly youare supporting terrorism. Or, as Bush put it: “You are either with us or againstus.” (Roughly translated that means: “You either don’t have a brain or you do.”)This was the story parroted hour after hour, week after week, by the mainstreammedia across the world. The media is a megaphone for the official version ofevents. Official sources tell the media what happened and the media repeat thisslavishly and call it “news”. The BBC and its like, for example, reported the“hijacker passport” story without any reference to the fact that it was clearlyridiculous. No, really, the FBI told us, so it must be true.Timothy Lee Harvey bin LadenColin Powell attended a meeting of the National Security Council at the WhiteHouse after 9/11 and it was agreed that he, Bush and deputy Secretary of StateRichard Armitage would work to build an “international consensus” againstterrorism. What a trio to lead the world in a moral crusade against those whopursue crimes against humanity! Pinch me, please. The message was: Osama binLaden is the Mr Big behind 9/11 and as the Taliban are protecting him inAfghanistan they would have to be removed as well if they did not hand him over.By Tony Blair’s own admission, no evidence whatsoever was produced that wouldhave stood the test of a courtroom. But that mattered not. Bush, Blair, andtheir handlers and henchmen had decided that was the story and that was the endof it. When the Taliban asked for evidence against bin Laden before handing himover, Bush replied: “They are harbouring a terrorist and they need to hand himover. There’s no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he’s guilty.” 33What a perfect summary of the arrogant dictatorship that runs America and thewider world. Don’t do as I do, do as I say. Powell and Blair embarked on their“whirlwind diplomacy” to gather support for the Anglo-American “war onterrorism”. This “diplomacy”, as usual, involved telling their hosts around theworld about the consequences for them and their countries of not doing what wasdemanded. Powell publicly warned Pakistan: “… as we gather information and as welook at possible sources of the attack, it would be useful to point out to thePakistani leadership at every level that we are looking for and expecting theirfullest cooperation and their help and support”.34 Pakistan President GeneralPervez Musharraf knew the score and Pakistan’s military dictatorship, with ahorrendous record of supporting terrorist groups, joined the “war on terrorism”.This involved handing over decision-making to Bush, Powell and the rest ofAmerican government mafia, but then that was no problem for the Pakistanauthorities and their intelligence network because that is a branch of the CIAanyway. Musharraf “won” five more years in office in a “referendum” in lateApril 2002, which was described by the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan as a“humiliating fraud”.35 Obviously they moved the gang in from Florida to ensurethe right result.Terrorists “fight” terrorismThe criteria for joining the anti-terrorism “coalition” was not your record ofsupporting terrorism because on that basis the United States and Britain wouldhave been denied membership before anyone. No, the criteria was: will you dowhat the United States and Britain tell you to do? If yes, you’re in and againstterrorism; if no, you are a supporter of terrorism. These guys really are thebullies of the world. They had the nerve to wheel out the “first ladies”, LauraBush and Cherie Blair, within 24 hours of each other to condemn the Taliban fortheir treatment of women. Yes, the Taliban’s sick ideology was horrible, but nota word was said about the appalling treatment of women by Saudi Arabia, where Ilived for some months in the late 1970s. The difference between the condemnationof the Taliban and the silence about Saudi Arabia was simply that the Talibanwas the target to be demonised to justify the invasion of Afghanistan while theSaudis who joined the “war on terrorism” are an arm of the United States and theCarlyle Group of Daddy Bush, Baker and Carlucci. This is the peace-loving,justice-supporting, Saudi Arabia that is the home of Osama bin Laden and much ofhis funding; the Saudi Arabia that conducts a terrorist war against its ownpeople to keep the tyrants and hypocrites in the Saudi “royal” family in poweras poodles of the US government; and the Saudi Arabia that continues to chop offpeople’s heads and hands according to their Nazi religious “law”. Saudi Arabiais controlled by a deeply disturbed terrorist regime – the “royal” dictatorship– and hypocrisy rules, OK? This becomes even more blatant when you consider thatit was Saudi and US support that underpinned the Taliban. Who are the “advisers”to the Saudi royal family? Father George’s Carlyle Group. Who are very close tothe “royal” House of Saud? The bin Laden family. Who owned the NationalCommercial Bank the Saudi royal family uses to conduct its business affairs?Khalid bin Mahfouz, funder of Bush family businesses, 20% shareholder in theBCCI, and named by the US government as a funder of Osama bin Laden. Whocontrols that bank now? Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, a close business associateof bin Mahfouz, and another man named as a funder of Osama bin Laden’s network.What was the bank named by the US government as a source of the funding for binLaden? The National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Who were part of theconsortium with Unocal to build the pipelines across Afghanistan? Delta(Al-Amoudi) and Nimir (bin Mahfouz). No wonder Saudi Arabia was considered oneof the good guys by Bush and Blair while the Taliban were condemned and bombedinto oblivion. I think, however, that demonising Saudi Arabia to advance theagenda may be part of the plan also sometime in the future. Everyone andeverything is expendable to these people when it suits the agenda.Secretary of State Colin Powell, reading from the script, pledged “to make surethat we go after terrorism and get it by its branch and root”.36 That did not,of course, include his own involvement in terrorist activity on behalf of theUnited States government or anyone who took orders from that government.Sanctions against Pakistan in response to its nuclear weapons programme wereremoved by President Bush when the Pakistani leadership agreed to play ball.Funny how Pakistan and India having nuclear weapons was so dangerous thatsanctions were imposed, but suddenly, when they agreed to follow orders fromBush and his masters after 9/11, that “nuclear threat” immediately diminished.The next thing you know they are both threatening to use them against eachother. But what arrogance to say that the US and Britain can have nuclearweapons by right, but any lesser political and economic power must not. NATO andthe United Nations also played their parts in the 9/11 movie. The UN SecurityCouncil has only five permanent members – the United States, Britain, China,France and Russia. These five have the power of veto over “substantive issues”.The Security Council has, in truth, been dominated by Britain and America, sonaturally it would follow the party line after September 11th with a call for“all necessary means” to be used to overcome the threat of terrorism. NATOrolled over and purred, not least because the NATO Secretary General was LordRobertson, a close associate of Tony Blair and his former Secretary of Defence.Like Blair, Robertson attends meetings of the Illuminati’s Bilderberg Group andwas invited to the one at Turnberry in Scotland shortly before being namedSecretary General of NATO in 1999. The last six heads of NATO have been from theBilderberg Group. The day after September 11th, the 19-member NATO Council,“encouraged” by Robertson, invoked for the first time Article Five of itsfounding charter. This says that an attack on one member is an attack on all ofthem. Clearly copies of the script had been widely distributed.Puppet parliamentsBoth Houses of Congress authorised Bush to “use all necessary and appropriateforce” against those responsible, including any nations supporting them, and theUK parliament gave Blair similar unquestioned backing to do the same (when heeven bothered to ask). This meant that within days of the attacks the Bush-BlairIlluminati-serving Axis of Evil (the real one) had all it needed to wage a warthat had been years in the planning. While both the US and UK governments hadlong failed the poor, homeless, and deprived through a “lack of money to doeverything we would like”, suddenly, as with all wars, money was no object.Funny how there is a shortage of money to keep people alive and help themachieve a decent quality of life, but there is never a shortage of funds tospend on killing and maiming them. There is a simple reason for this: when thereis something the Illuminati want to happen to advance their agenda, theIlluminati produce the funds to make happen. Congress immediately sanctioned $40billion for the “war on terrorism” and within months Bush announced a $48billion increase in defence spending to “fight the war on terror”. This was anincrease of almost 15%, the biggest in 20 years, and it brought U.S militaryspending to $379 billion. The money has been assigned, so we are told, to salaryincreases for military personnel (dictators always look after their soldiers)and the latest precision weapons, missile defences, unmanned vehicles andhigh-tech equipment for ground troops. A large chunk will also go to “homelanddefence” (control of the people) and Bush called for the hiring of 30,000airport security workers and an extra 300 FBI agents – an FBI which, with 4,000operatives already, did not, we are told officially, have the slightest cluethat the biggest terrorist attack in history had been in the planning for years.The CIA budget is also due to increase by an estimated $1.5 billion or $2billion by 2003, although we can’t know the true figure because the CIA budgetis classified.37 “I have a responsibility to prepare the nation for all thatlies ahead,” Bush said. He was right, too. A responsibility to the Illuminatihierarchy to prepare the nation for what they have already planned will lieahead.Forever John WaynePresident Bush, like Reagan and all American leaders, has a massive built-inadvantage in his pursuit of a dictatorship at home and mass murder abroad. It isthe collective mind of America. Individually Americans are overwhelminglywonderful people and a joy to know and be with. They are almost always helpful,kind, and friendly. But the collective mind, the national mind if you like, canbe barely one-dimensional when it falls for the manipulations of its government.There is a part of the American collective psyche that is forever John Wayne. Itsees only good guys and bad guys, cowboys and Indians, black and white. ManyAmericans (though it is changing) see the world in these terms and their accessto foreign news and events is so sparse and slanted in the US media that theyhave virtually no idea what is happening beyond the American borders, or eveninside them come to that. Instead they let their leaders tell them what ishappening and they are sold a fantasy based on the clichéd script of a moviestarring John Wayne or Sylvester Stallone. Rocky and Rambo have long had desksin the PR offices at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon.Bush’s speechwriters targeted exactly this response after 9/11 by providingquotes like: “I can hear you and the rest of the world hears you and the peoplewho knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” Get on yer horse BigJaaahn. This planet ain’t big enough for the both of us. The Rambo response – nosubtleties, no shades of grey, shoot first and ask no questions – is used tomanipulate the emotions of the American psyche and to activate macho man andmacho woman. Mainstream radio talk show hosts are classic expressions of thiswith their mindless calls to “nuke ’em” whenever the bullies in government pickyet another fight with a country that has no means of credible defence. Amongthe public responses quoted in the media in the aftermath of September 11th wasthat of Joan Renshaw, a grandmother in Atlanta: “I’m angry. I’m hoping we wipethese people out, and if we need to, wipe out the country that is hosting them.Just get rid of them all.”38 Then there was Phil Beckwith, a former Navy ChiefPetty Officer from Wyoming: “I know just what to do with these Arab people. Wehave to find them, kill them, wrap them in pigskin and bury them. That way theywill never go to heaven. Bury Osama bin Laden with a pigskin, donate blood forthe people in New York and God bless this great country.” 39 We have the samecollective mentality in Britain, although there appears to be a much greateroutbreak of scepticism here among the general public. Calls in America andelsewhere for a peaceful response to September 11th were lost in the clamour andlust for revenge. One banner encapsulated the situation when it said, “An Eyefor An Eye Makes the World Blind”. But such sentiments were dismissed as weakand cowardly, or even, as support for the terrorists. Add all these politicaland public responses together and it meant only one thing: thousands ofcivilians in Afghanistan who had never seen Osama bin Laden, including childrenwho had never even heard of him, were now doomed to die from bombs dropped ontheir already devastated settlements by the forces of “freedom” and “justice”.The Solution“War” with AfghanistanAs in Iraq, the “real men” of the American and British Air Forces bravely flewout of range of the ancient technology that passed for the Afghanistan airdefences while dropping state-of-the-art bombs and missiles on civilians. Onceagain this was not a war; that needs two sides. This was the playground bully atwork, and it was just another cold-blooded slaughter. The US government boughtthe rights to all satellite images of Afghanistan before the bombing started inorder to hide where their bombs were really being targeted. The following aresome of the reports of civilian deaths that were made public. The vast majoritywere not.> •October 11th: Two US jets bombed the mountain village of Karam. The death> toll was estimated at between 100 and 160.> •October 13th: Bombs fell on the Qila Meer Abas neighbourhood, two kilometres> south of Kabul airport. Four civilians were reportedly killed.> •October 18th: 47 civilians were said to have been killed when a central> marketplace near Kandahar was bombed.> •October 23rd: More than 90 civilians were reportedly killed when low-flying> US gun ships fired on the farming villages of Bori Chokar and Chowkar-karez,> north of Kandahar.> •October 31st: An F-18 attacked a Red Crescent clinic in a pre-dawn raid> killing between 15 and 25 people.> •November 10th: Villages in the Khakrez district were reportedly bombed,> killing more than 150 civilians.40On that terrible morning of September 11th 2001 it is estimated that 2,998civilians died in New York, Washington and the crash of Flight 93 inPennsylvania. They called it the worst terrorist attack in history. Yet a studyby Professor Marc Herold of the University of New Hampshire concluded thatbetween October 7th and December 7th 2001 at least 3,800 Afghanistan civilians(men, women, and children with no connection whatsoever to 9/11) died fromAmerican and British attacks. This figure was a “very, very conservativeestimate,” Professor Herold said. “I think that a much more realistic figurewould be around 5,000,” he suggested, “You know for Afghanistan, 3,700 to 5,000is a really substantial number.” 41 Professor Herold’s figures were based onlyon deaths reported in the mainstream media and did not include those in remoteareas of Afghanistan and those unreported in the press (God only knows how manythat would be). Nor does the figure include those who died because the airstrikes prevented their access to hospitals, food or electricity, or those whowere injured and died later. Add together all of the Afghan civilians who diedas a result of the US-British bombardment and you will have a figure of many,many, thousands more than those who died on September 11th. If 9/11 was the“worst terrorist act in history” what does that make the attacks on civilians inAfghanistan, never mind Iraq? They said that what happened in America was “evil”and then responded by killing even more civilians in a far-away country. In thenewspeak of the Illuminati they called this mass murder of the innocent“Operation Infinite Justice” and then “Operation Enduring Freedom”. A group ofAmericans who lost relatives in the attacks of September 11th showed morehumanity and understanding in one day than Bush has shown since he first cameunder his father’s spell. They flew to Kabul to meet Afghans who lost members oftheir own families in the Bush-Blair bombing. Derrill Bodley, a music professorfrom California, lost his 20-year-old daughter Deora, who was on United AirlinesFlight 93, which went down in Pennsylvania. He met the father of a five-year-oldAfghan girl who died when an American bomb landed on a residential area ofKabul. Bodley said: “This trip is about respect and love for all human beings –regardless of where they come from.” 42 That is the real voice of Americaspeaking. The voice I see in the vast majority of Americans I meet once theyhave stopped, taken a breath and cleared their minds of their government’spropaganda and life-long conditioning.Massacre in the moonlightAs I cannot say too often, those who claim to lead America have no love fortheir country or their people. Whether the dead are Americans or Afghans orIraqis makes no difference to the Illuminati. They see them as the same cattle,the same cannon fodder, on the road to global control. One of the few newsreports to tell any truth about the calculated attacks on Afghan civilians waswritten by Catherine Philip in the Weekend Australian of November 3rd–4th 2001.Filing from Quetta in Pakistan, she told a chilling story of what so many Afghanvillagers experienced. Under the headline “Massacre in the Moonlight – Alarm ofa Different Kind”, she reported:> “When Zamina Ahmed was awakened by the warplanes roaring overhead and heard> the deafening boom of a bomb dropping close by, her first thought was to get> out of the house. Grabbing her son, Sabir, 5, she ran into the courtyard of> the sprawling family compound, searching for a safe place to hide.> “Behind her in the house, her daughter, Shaida, 14, cowered in her bed, too> terrified to run. As the door banged shut, she heard the deafening rattle of> gunfire from the sky. She looked out of the glassless window in time to see> her mother slump lifeless to the ground. ‘The moon was shining and in the> light, I saw her fall to the ground with Sabir still in her arms,’ Shaida> said. ‘I knew she had been shot’.> “Naseer Mohammed, 20, and his niece, Najia, 14, had nearly made it out of the> compound when the bullets started raining down. One bullet caught Najia> squarely in the chest, killing her instantly. Mr Mohammed ran on to find> cover, leaving her body sprawled on the dusty ground.> “Hiding in the entrance to a nearby cave, he watched as the gunships –> believed to be American AC130s, deployed to hunt down and kill Taliban forces> and terrorists from the al-Qaeda network – circled over the village firing> repeatedly at the people as they fled their homes.> “‘When they dropped the first bomb, everyone ran out and then they began> firing on the people,’ Mr Mohammed said. ‘I was very frightened and confused.> I wondered why are they doing this to us.’ The attack lasted an hour. By the> time it was over, 18 members of the family were dead, five of them children.> All were killed by gunfire after they ran into the open.> “‘Just because I hid in a room, I am alive,’ Shaida said. ‘Those who ran into> the yard were killed.’ Survivors arriving across the border in Quetta,> Pakistan, say as many as 17 other civilians died in the attack on Chowkar> Karez village on the evening of October 22, bringing the total of dead to 35.> The accounts they give of the attack are strikingly consistent. Without> exception, they say the first bomb was dropped around 11pm, that most people> immediately ran outside in fear and were then mown down by gunfire from the> circling gunships. ‘They were huge planes,’ Mr Mohammed said. ‘If the Taliban> and Osama bin Laden are the targets then why were they shooting at us?’> “Whatever happened in Chowkar Karez, it does not appear to be a simple case of> a bomb going astray. The gunners who strafed the village clearly believed that> there was something there that they had to destroy. On the night of October> 23, the day after the first attack, the planes returned, circling overhead and> firing into the houses. That time, the people stayed inside. In the morning,> they left. None of the villagers seem sure if they would return. For those who> survived, the wounds go as deep as shrapnel.” 43This is just another every-day story of America and Britain making war onterrorism. It was Iraq revisited with many more like it destined to come untilthe people of this world emerge from their comatose state. Andrew Gumbel,writing in the UK Independent of November 3rd, also reported the massacre ofChowkar Karez. He wrote that “Western journalists and human rights organisationspublished the clearest evidence yet of mass civilian casualties caused by theAmerican bombing campaign yesterday”. He went on:> “Visiting journalists counted 18 fresh graves but were told the villagers had> not been able to sort out the many severed limbs and body parts to give each> person their own final resting place. ‘As we buried the dead, the planes came> again,’ said an old farmer called Mangal, who claimed to have lost 30> relatives including 12 women and 14 children. ‘We had to work quickly. Not> everyone got their own grave’ …” 44The Pentagon confirmed that an AC-130 Spectre gunship attacked the village(several were involved, not only one, the villagers said), but a spokesmanclaimed it was a “legitimate target”. However, anything is deemed a legitimatetarget to these disturbed people. “There was a positively identified Talibanencampment, which included al-Qa’ida collaborators, in the vicinity of Chowkarthat was struck in October,” a Pentagon parrot told the Washington Post. “Theencampment was fully developed and was a legitimate military target under thelaw of armed conflict.”45 The same law, I take it, that says that those whodefend themselves against such attacks from a foreign aggressor cannot be calledprisoners of war because they weren’t wearing uniforms. In other words,America’s law, Britain’s law, Illuminati law, which constantly changes to fitthe moment and has no regard for life.Intellectual prostitutesThe reports of Afghan casualties and the targeting of civilians I have featuredhere are rare because of the media management orchestrated through the politicaland military network and the Illuminati-owned media like CNN, a subsidiary ofAOL-Time Warner. The New York-based organisation called FAIR (Fairness andAccuracy in Reporting)46 highlighted the extraordinary comments by WalterIsaacson, the chairman of CNN or, as I call it, Claptrap No News or the CriminalNews Network. As reported by the Washington Post,47 Isaacson “ … ordered hisstaff to balance images of civilian devastation in Afghan cities with remindersthat the Taliban harbors murderous terrorists, saying it ‘seems perverse tofocus too much on the casualties or hardship in Afghanistan’.” Isaacson had thenerve to tell the Washington Post: “I want to make sure we’re not used as apropaganda platform.” 48 No kidding. These guys have no shame. Howard Kurtz, thePost’s media reporter, quoted a memo from Isaacson to CNN’s internationalcorrespondents that admonished reporters covering civilian deaths not to “forgetit is that country’s leaders who are responsible for the situation Afghanistanis now in”. He suggested that journalists should put the responsibility forcivilian deaths with the Taliban, not the American military. Kurtz also quoted amemo from Rick Davis, CNN’s head of “standards” and practices, which recommendedthe following sample comments for news presenters to say after reports of Afghancivilian casualties:> “We must keep in mind, after seeing reports like this from Taliban-controlled> areas, that these US military actions are in response to a terrorist attack> that killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US’ or, ‘We must keep in> mind, after seeing reports like this, that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan> continues to harbor terrorists who have praised the September 11 attacks that> killed close to 5,000 innocent people in the US’ or ‘The Pentagon has> repeatedly stressed that it is trying to minimize civilian casualties in> Afghanistan, even as the Taliban regime continues to harbor terrorists who are> connected to the September 11 attacks that claimed thousands of innocent lives> in the US’” 49Davis added that “even though it may start sounding rote, it is important thatwe make this point each time”. During its US broadcasts CNN “quickly switched tothe rubble of the World Trade Center” after showing images of the damage inKandahar and the news anchor “reminded viewers of the deaths of as many as 5,000people whose biggest crime was going to work and getting there on time”.50 Sowhat was the biggest crime of Afghan children then? Appalling as CNN may be,this outrageous manipulation of news can be found all over the world. The NewYork Times reported that such policies were being implemented at othertelevision networks. “In the United States television images of Afghan bombingvictims are fleeting, cushioned between anchors or American officials explainingthat such sights are only one side of the story”, the New York Times said.51While the mainstream media spews out the official story of 9/11 those whoquestion or expose it are virtually denied access. Investigator Mike Ruppert hadhis scheduled appearance on the Murdoch Fox channel cancelled at the last minutein May 2002. The Geraldo Rivera programme said that there was no time for himbecause the New York Times was breaking a story of newly interceptedcommunications from al-Qaeda that suggested another attack was imminent. Wellhow come they didn’t intercept communications before 9/11 then? Of course thereason for the cancellation was that someone higher up said no. The same hashappened to me when presenters and reporters have asked me to appear and thenthe invitation is withdrawn close to airtime accompanied by one of those “Er,um, er,” stuttering “explanations” that insult the intelligence.How does anyone believe the media is going to tell us the truth when the veryforces that are desperate to deny us the truth own the press and broadcasting?The three major US television networks, CBS, NBC and ABC, are an excellent casein point. The giant Westinghouse owns CBS, and NBC is controlled by GeneralElectric. These are both companies that make a fortune from wars and theIlluminati agenda as a whole. In 1996 Disney bought ABC. This has been anIlluminati operation since Mickey Mouse and is constantly named in relation tomind-control programmes (see The Biggest Secret). The “Watergate” journalistCarl Bernstein has written that hundreds of prominent US media owners andjournalists have knowingly worked for the CIA, including William Paley of CBS,Arthur Sulzberger of the New York Times, Henry Luce of Time-Life, WilliamBuckley of the National Review, and Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post.52Journalist Deborah Davis also reveals the CIA-media connection in her book,Katherine the Great, an investigation into the long-time publisher of theWashington Post, the late Katherine Graham.53 The book was apparently “pulledfrom bookstores and pulped” after objections from Graham, but Davis took herpublishers to court for censorship and won. It was republished with SheridanSquare Press in 1991.54 Davis writes that by the 1950s the CIA “owned respectedmembers of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, and other communications vehicles,plus at least four to six hundred reporters, according to a CIA analyst.” 55What must it be today? As Robert Lederman, a New York writer, artist andcampaigner, put it: “The media is not influenced by the CIA – the media is theCIA.” 56 A man behind this media takeover was Frank Wisner, who orchestratedProject Paperclip, the CIA operation that arranged for a long list of Nazis toescape from Germany at the end of the war to continue their work for theIlluminati in the United States, South America and elsewhere. If the media istelling you something it is because that is what the authorities want you tobelieve. As someone once said in a television drama: “A lie can go around theworld before the truth has got its boots on.” This is possible because of mediaowners like Katherine Graham, publisher of the Washington Post and a member ofthe Illuminati’s Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations and TrilateralCommission. She said in a speech at CIA headquarters in 1988:> “We live in a dirty and dangerous world. There are some things the general> public does not need to know and shouldn’t. I believe democracy flourishes> when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets, and when> the press can decide whether to print what it knows.” 57This is the mentality that is telling you what happened on September 11th, whowas responsible, and what should happen as a result. These are also the peoplewho are “reporting” the wars and giving you the government propaganda to justifythem. Comforting, isn’t it?Bye, bye freedomAcross the world, the deaths of those 3,000 Americans and citizens of 80 nationshave been used to promote the destruction of basic freedoms. Even when I was inNew Zealand two months after 9/11 they were proposing new “anti-terrorism” lawsto “protect the public”. How on earth anyone in New Zealand is in any moredanger now than they were on September 10th 2001 would defeat anyone with amodicum of intelligence. Enough to move your eyelids would be sufficient to seewhat a nonsense that is. But common sense is not the motivation here. The aimand the game is for the Illuminati to activate its operatives and unthinkingstooges to use the excuse of the World Trade Center disaster to further imprisonthe human cattle. Gary Hart of the Council on Foreign Relations talked of “acontinuing trade off between security and liberty and freedom going forward intothe 21st century”.58 US Attorney General John Ashcroft set about his task withundisguised relish, and the dismantling of freedoms and the increase ingovernment surveillance has been introduced with what the American CivilLiberties Union calls “dizzying speed”.59 Ashcroft and the Bush administrationrushed through the “USA Patriot Act” in response to the 9/11 attacks and I haveno doubt it was already drafted well before those planes took off from Bostonairport. In fact James X. Dempsey and David Cole reveal in their book, Terrorismand the Constitution: Sacrificing Civil Liberties in the Name of NationalSecurity,60 that the most extreme elements of the “anti-terrorism” lawsintroduced after Oklahoma and September 11th were developed “long before thebombings that triggered their final enactment.” Dempsey is a former assistantcounsel to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights,and Cole is a professor of law at Georgetown University and an attorney with theCenter for Constitutional Rights. They document how it was the Reagan-Bush andBush-Quayle administrations that first proposed some of the “most troublingprovisions” that were to become law after Oklahoma and September 11th, butCongress had rejected them as unconstitutional. These included giving power tothe Secretary of State to designate groups as terrorist organisations withoutjudicial or congressional review. But then came the Oklahoma bombing andattitudes began to change as people like Senator Orrin Hatch from Mormon Utahaggressively supported the introduction of the Bush proposals. Hatch is the manwho dismissed any suggestion that the authorities were responsible for Waco; whotook money from Rumsfeld’s Searle pharmaceuticals to support aspartame; who madestirring speeches in support of the BCCI; who called those who questioned the“anti-terrorism” laws after 9/11 as nothing more than “Senate egos”; who toldthe media immediately after the September 11th attacks that Osama bin Laden wasthe likely suspect. Nice man. “Senator Hatch wanted to make it more difficultfor federal courts to order retrials of prisoners where state courts hadviolated the US Constitution”, according to Dempsey and Cole. In the wake ofOklahoma the dismantling of basic freedoms first proposed by Father George Bushbecame law and even more so after September 11th. A coincidence? Not a chance.As I mentioned earlier, whenever the Illuminati use words the real meaning isthe very opposite of how they are presented. For example, the control of theworld economy by a few global corporations owned by the same people is called“free trade” and a dictatorship is called a democracy or a “democratic front”.In this case, removing the very freedoms on which the United States claims tohave been founded is called an act of patriotism or a “USA Patriot Act”, a termthat derives from the very deliberate naming of the legislation as “Uniting andStrengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept andObstruct Terrorism Act”. The government demonises “patriots” and “patriotism”when the American Patriot movement challenges the tyranny of government and theglobal conspiracy, but “patriotism” is promoted when it means doing whatever thegovernment tells you. This is an old, old, trick. Theodore Roosevelt definedpatriotism in far more sensible and mature terms. He said:> “Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the> president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he> himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he> efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the> exact extent that by inefficiently or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand> by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth,> whether about the president or anyone else.”As Samuel Johnson said: “Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.” ThePatriot Act, and other legislation and presidential decrees, have basicallygiven those that control the American government the legal right to do whateverthey like. Many of these new “laws” have been implemented through a scamintroduced by the Boy George administration called the “emergency rule-makingauthority”, which exempts the Attorney General from respecting the normal noticeand comment period for such changes. Crucially for Americans, the definition ofa terrorist in the Patriot Act is designed to apply to them also. The actdefines terrorism as activities that “involve acts dangerous to human life thatare a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; orappear to be intended ‘to intimidate or coerce a civilian population’ and “toinfluence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion”. That could bedefined as almost anything, including legitimate peaceful protest. PresidentBush issued a “Military Order” on November 13th 2001 that makes legal thepotentially indefinite detention of any “non-citizen” accused of terrorism, andpermits the “trial” of such defendants by a secret military commission with noprovision for judicial review.61 The person can therefore be chosen by thePresident to go before a secret tribunal, which can “try”, convict and sentencehim, including imposing the death sentence, without making any of its evidenceor the defence case available to the public. Indeed the public would not have tobe told the tribunal had even happened. Christopher Pyle, Professor of Politicsand Constitutional Law at Mount Holyoke College, says that military tribunals donot need to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or even “a preponderanceof evidence pointing to guilt”. He adds: “The court just needs to convince themajority of the military officers present – all of whom see themselves as being‘at war’ with this prisoner … that he has been involved in a terrorist act.” 62This Presidential Order was issued without a formal Congressional declaration ofwar and without Congressional authorisation to use military tribunals. ProfessorPyle said he has no idea how Bush even had the power to make such laws. “Wheredoes the President get the right to do this?” he says. “He claims the right todo this as President, as commander in chief, pursuant to the resolution passedin Congress after the September 11th attacks and pursuant to several statutes inUS code. But there’s nothing in either the Congressional resolution or federallaw that allows the President to override the legislative process.” 63This fascist order from Bush for secret military “trials” applies to anyindividual the President claims to have “reason to believe” is: (a) a member ofal-Qaeda; (b) in any way involved in “acts of international terrorism” (a termthat is not defined by the order); or (c) has “knowingly harbored” either of theabove. Administration officials have announced that they intend to use PresidentBush’s “Military Order” in any case in which they decide that an open publichearing would not be consistent with the needs of security. Bush spokesmen saythe order applies only to those accused of war crimes, but the jurisdiction ofthe order does not include any such restriction.64 The order therefore gives aliar, crook and promoter of capital punishment like George W. Bush, and hissuccessors, the right to ignore the United States criminal justice systemwhenever it suits him or the agenda he serves. Watch for these laws beingextended to include US citizens when an excuse for that can be manufactured. Yetthe vast majority of Americans stand by and watch this happen, even cheer insupport while believing they live in the “freest country in the world”. You havealmost got to laugh. Almost. The following are some of the other powers includedin the “Patriot Act” and related new laws that were introduced only because ofthe September 11th attacks. Much of the information is supplied by the AmericanCivil Liberties Union.65The Patriot Act allows federal agents to search a person’s home secretly;monitor anyone’s Internet browsing whenever they choose; expand wiretaps withoutany need for permission from a judge (not that this would be hard to get, to saythe least); seize voicemail messages; and give secret grand jury testimony tothe FBI and intelligence agencies. Law enforcement officers now have the legalright to share intercepts of telephone conversations and Internet communicationswith the CIA, National Security Agency, Department of Defense and other federalagencies with no court order required and there are, in effect, no restrictionson the subsequent use of recorded conversations. The Act does not prohibit theCIA and other agencies from sharing with foreign governments the surveillanceinformation gleaned from a criminal investigation, even if this could put atrisk a person’s family living abroad. This information can include medicalrecords, mental health records, financial records, video rental records,fingerprints, DNA samples from a person’s hair, employment records,“employment-based” drug-testing records and immigration records maintained bynon-profit agencies. Before this, FBI agents had to seek such permission from ajudge or through a grand jury subpoena issued in connection with a criminalinvestigation. These safeguards are no longer necessary. They can do what theywant.Section 215 of the Patriot Act grants FBI agents authority to obtain an orderfrom a “FISA” court or any federal magistrate requiring any person or businessto produce any books, records, documents or items. FISA is the US ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 that was “updated” across the millenniumto allow wiretaps of American residents who would otherwise be beyond the FBI’sauthority. Under the Patriot Act a judge has no discretion with these FBIrequests. He or she must issue the order after receiving an FBI application thatclaims to be involved in a foreign intelligence investigation. It doesn’t haveto be true; they just have to say it. This means that the FBI can secretlyconduct a physical search or wiretap to obtain “evidence of a crime” withoutproving the probable cause of a crime. All they need to do is claim“intelligence authority”, even when the person whose home they wish to breakinto, or whose telephone they want to tap, is an American. Given the FBI’shorrific and well-documented history of investigating people merely because oftheir race or political views, it is easy to see how these powers will be used.The New York Times also reported that Attorney General Ashcroft was consideringa plan to relax restrictions on the FBI by giving them greater freedom to spy onreligious and political organizations.66 All these new laws make the FBI and theCIA, in effect, the same organisation – exactly what the Illuminati want intheir agenda of centralisation and globalisation. The Patriot Act means that theCIA can now easily spy on American citizens, a role it has been forbidden totake, at least in law, since the Church Committee exposed appalling abuses ofits surveillance of American citizens in the 1970s. But now the Patriot Actallows disclosure to the CIA of “foreign intelligence information” obtained inconnection with a domestic criminal investigation, without defining “foreignintelligence information”. This, says the American Civil Liberties Union,represents “extraordinary extensions of the previous powers of the foreignintelligence agencies, including the CIA, to obtain information aboutAmericans”.67 All this will happen without a court order.Ashcroft’s Department of “Justice” can now monitor conversations between“suspects” and their lawyers (when they can get one). All “Justice” Departmentofficials require is “reasonable suspicion” (and they decide what that means) tobelieve that a prisoner “may” use communications with attorneys or their agents“to further or facilitate acts of terrorism”. The regulation requires that theDirector of the Bureau of Prisons “shall … provide appropriate procedures forthe monitoring or review of communications between that inmate and attorneys orattorneys’ agents who are traditionally covered by the attorney-clientprivilege. This includes pre-trial detainees who have not been convicted of anycrime and are therefore presumed innocent, and material witnesses andindividuals who are being held on suspected immigration violations and are notaccused of any crime.Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions now monitor daily financialtransactions even more closely than before and are required to share thisinformation with federal agencies, including intelligence agencies like the CIA.These provisions go far beyond searching for terrorist funds or money laundering(like the Bush-connected BCCI) and involve snooping on perfectly innocentfinancial transactions by American citizens. Once again the “fight againstterrorism” is being used to massively increase surveillance of the verypopulation these new laws are supposed to be “protecting” from terrorism.Section 358 allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to gain easy andsecret access to credit reports. These agencies would not have to ask a judgefor permission and the person involved would never know what had happened. It isanother “do what you like” invasion of privacy, with the agencies having norequirement to justify their actions with evidence of a crime, suspiciousactivity, or even relevance to an investigation.When it comes to the government being open to the same scrutiny, however, that’sanother story. Ashcroft has sought to undermine the American Freedom ofInformation Act with a change of policy that encourages federal agencies toresist Freedom of Information Act requests whenever they have legal grounds todo so. He has told them to withhold information whenever they could argue a“sound legal basis” for doing so. On one hand, they are introducing laws togather more information about people while, on the other, seeking to preventthem knowing, under Freedom of Information, what is on government files.“Homeland security” (homeland control)The Patriot Act was claimed to be the result of two weeks of “closed-doornegotiations” between Congress and the Bush administration. Bullshit.Congressman Ron Paul said they were not even allowed to read the Patriot Billbefore they were asked to vote on it, and the “sunset clauses” that people wereled to believe limited the period the laws are in force turn out not to apply tothe most important areas that remove basic freedoms. The legislation, as alwaysin these cases, was already drafted and waiting before those planes struck theWorld Trade Center. Coordinating this invasion of privacy and the vast expansionof surveillance under the guise of fighting terrorism is the Office of HomelandSecurity, more accurately known in my house as the Office of Homeland Control.It is amazing how often that, by swapping the word “security” for “control”, youget the truth about an organisation or situation. In fact you can do this withall the Illuminati statements. Reverse them and you see what they really mean.The Office of Homeland Security – a classic Big Brother title – was created byBush immediately “after” September 11th and is headed by the President’s pal TomRidge, the former Governor of Pennsylvania. After he was elected Governor in1993 he introduced new anti-crime laws, some of which were ruledunconstitutional.68 Ridge campaigned for all juveniles to be tried as adults andfor them to serve adult sentences in adult prisons. He reversed a three-to-oneratio of granting parole to a three-to-one ratio against.69 Under Ridge’sleadership, the state police were ordered to raid the headquarters of peoplepreparing to protest at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.Some 500 people were arrested before they could protest and most were neverconvicted of any offence. Ridge and Bush both have the same approach to “lawenforcement”. Ridge presided over the first state execution in Pennsylvaniasince 1960 and then embarked on a policy of signing a stream of executionwarrants, just as Bush did as Governor of Texas. It was Ridge who pressed forthe legislation that introduced the “three-strikes law” and a faster deathpenalty process. The three-strikes law was a stunning piece of insane stupiditythat mandated life prison sentences for anyone convicted of three felonies. Thistreats a murder as a “strike” in the same way as filling out a false driver’slicence application. I can see why Bush chose Ridge to head “Homeland Security”.Ridge’s role is to create an ever more centralised pyramid of governmentagencies that will allow even fewer people to dictate the policy and actions ofwhat are supposed to be “independent” organisations like the FBI and CIA. AsBush said when he announced the appointment of Ridge:> “Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local> governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts> must be coordinated at the highest level.” 70In short, centralise and solidify the pyramid to ensure ever more control overever more people by ever fewer. Dick Cheney appointed Admiral Steve Abbot asRidge’s number two. Abbot was Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the US EuropeanCommand during the conflict in Kosovo and was Deputy Director of Operations forthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Colin Powell) at the end of theFather George Bush administration. In May 2001, four months before September11th, Dick Cheney launched a review to “strengthen preparedness against an actof domestic terrorism, particularly one using a weapon of mass destruction”.71Admiral Abbot was appointed to lead this Cheney group as Executive Director ofthe Vice President’s National Preparedness Review. Abbot is a Rhodes Scholar.These are carefully chosen overseas students, like Bill Clinton, who are sent toEngland to study at Oxford University. These elite scholarships are named afterCecil Rhodes, one of the most infamous Illuminati operatives of the last 200years (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret). The Officeof Homeland Security is dominated and controlled by the military through thePentagon and it is the Illuminati goal to have domestic “law enforcement”conducted by the military, just as any fascist or communist state would do.Airport security is already controlled by the military because of 9/11 and thatis designed to get the people used to having soldiers around calling the shotsin public places. The military running the airports is just the start. AsTimothy Edgar, a Legislative Counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union,says: “The military’s mission is not to respect constitutional liberties. Itsmission is to use overwhelming force to defeat and kill the enemy.” 72 But thenthat’s the idea. To the Illuminati and their henchmen like Bush, Cheney, et al.,the people are the enemy. Herr Bush announced in April 2002 another strand inAmerica’s centralised fascist state. It is Northern Command, or NORTHCOM. Thisis headed by a four-star general and will “coordinate” with the Office ofHomeland “Defense”. The first head of NORTHCOM was widely predicted in the mediato be Ralph Eberhart, the head of NORAD and Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain,whose inaction on September 11th was a disgrace. NORTHCOM will coordinate“homeland defence” for North America and Mexico and this is the first time thatMexico comes under a Pentagon command as the global state continues to unfold.General Richard Myers, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said NORTHCOMwould “streamline the Pentagon’s various agencies and commands now assigned tosupport homeland defense roles, putting them under one commander.” 73 Take awaythe Orwellian language and you are left with: “It will further centralise themilitary control of the United States.”Most sinister of all is the “Citizen Corps initiative”, the Bush (Illuminati)plan to recruit a million workers as informants who will report any suspected“terrorist activity” among their colleagues, friends, and clients. Theseinformants will be drawn from “truckers, letter carriers, train conductors, shipcaptains, utility employees and others”. The American Civil Liberties Union saidthe Orwellian “Terrorist Information and Prevention System” (TIPS) threatened toturn local cable or gas or electrical technicians into government-sanctionedpeeping toms. What was that I was saying about the masses policing each other?Now it’s official. This is the whole thrust of the Illuminati agenda – to getthe people to keep the people in line and act as a global intelligence gatheringnetwork in which no one will know who is a “friend” and who is a government spy.Like I say, they want a global version of Nazi Germany. Read George Orwell’sbook, 1984, if you want to now what they have planned.Federal evil malevolent agency (FEMA)One of the key organisations in the Illuminati armoury for their domesticdictatorship and homeland control in the United States is the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, or FEMA. It is supposed to be there to respond to disastersand emergencies, but in truth that is only a tiny part of its operation, thepart that is officially funded through government agencies. The real role ofFEMA is the one financed covertly by the profits from the multi-billion-dollarIlluminati-intelligence agency drug racket. Former Green Beret William Tyreelaunched a lawsuit against the CIA and Father George Bush in September 1998claiming that they had allowed the drug profits to fund FEMA’s covert activitieswithout the knowledge of Congress.74 FEMA was created through a presidentialExecutive Order, an undemocratic, dictatorial outrage, in which the Presidentintroduces laws without debate in Congress. An Executive Order issued by thePresident only has to appear in a legal newspaper called the Federal Register tobecome law, and great swathes of the Illuminati’s fascist-state-in-waiting hasbeen put together in this way. Among the founders of FEMA was ZbigniewBrzezinski, the man behind the Trilateral Commission at the behest of DavidRockefeller. Brzezinski predicted years ago in his book Between Two Ages,75 thata tiny elite would use its political and financial power and surveillancetechnology to control the population and dominate the masses. He could say thatwith confidence because he knew what was planned.Another famous name involved with FEMA was Oliver North, the drug-running goferfrom Iran-Contra. Ben Bradlee Jr writes in Guts and Glory: The Rise and Fall ofOliver North76 that the Iran-Contra “star” helped FEMA to stage a nationalemergency rehearsal in April 1984 known as Rex-84 Bravo. This was a practiceexercise in readiness for martial law and a FEMA takeover in the event of a“national emergency”. The Miami Herald reported in 1987 that North was involvedwith FEMA in exercises involving the rounding-up of refugees and“troublemakers”. Former Green Beret Colonel Albert Carone, who was murdered in1990, said in a sworn statement for the William Tyree lawsuit that he workedwith North in CIA-Mafia drug operations and he also confirmed North’s use ofdrug profits to create and fund FEMA. He said that FEMA violated the UnitedStates Constitution and “established a succession to the Office of the Presidentin the event of an emergency that circumvented the Vice President and theSpeaker of the House of Representatives”.77 Colonel Carone added: “Colonel OllieNorth worked on developing a plan known as FEMA, which would in an ill-definednational emergency, allow the US Military to take control of the United Statesto ensure National Security.” According to Carone’s statement, the term “FEMA”originally meant “Federal Emergency Military Action”, but was renamed“Management Agency” because the public would more easily accept it. Carone saidthat a National Security Council directive issued in 1981 states: “Normally astate of martial law will be proclaimed by the President. However in the absenceof such action by the President, a senior military commander may impose martiallaw in an area of his command where there had been a complete breakdown in theexercise of government functions by local authorities.” That directive, whichallows a military takeover inside the borders of the United States, was signedby … Frank Carlucci, now chairman of the Carlyle Group.FEMA and associated agencies have been given sweeping powers by presidentialexecutive orders to take control of all areas of life during a “nationalemergency” – whenever the Illuminati front men in government decide to invokethem. In such circumstances FEMA can force the population to live and workwherever they are told. People can be moved from their homes and have theirproperty seized, including farms and businesses. Their children can be takenaway from them and FEMA has the power to take over all communications, food andenergy sources, health care, finance, education, welfare and transportation,including your personal vehicles. The Postmaster General can order that all men,women and children are registered.78 It is also FEMA that controls the networkof concentration camps, or “detention centers”, in the United States that are inplace and waiting for the dissidents and “troublemakers” when the Illuminatifascist takeover is complete. Yes, concentration camps in America, of which morelater.Foreigners today, Americans tomorrowBy observing the treatment of foreign nationals since September 11th we can seethe future for Americans in their own land and for the rest of the world also.The authorities have been detaining people across America without charge ortrial on no grounds whatsoever except for the colour of their skin and countryof origin. Some cases have come to light, but most have not. Anser Mehmood, aPakistani truck driver in New Jersey, was allowed no contact with his family forthree months after he was arrested without charge in early October 2001. Hiswife and four children were forced to sell virtually every possession becausethey no longer had any income and were heading back to Karachi simply to survivewhile their husband and father awaits his fate. Mohammed Rafiq Butt, another mandetailed, died of heart failure at the Hudson County Jail in Kearny, New Jersey,on October 23rd.79 The Washington Post reported how two Pakistani immigrantswere held for 49 days before being charged with overstaying their visas and anIsraeli was held for 66 days before being charged with entering the countryillegally.80 A Saudi national Dr Al Bader Al-Hazmi, a radiologist at the TexasHealth Science Center, was held without access to either his lawyer or hisfamily for seven days. After nearly two weeks in detention, Dr Al-Hazmi wasreleased with no charges against him. The Wall Street Journal featured the caseof Tarek Mohamed Fayad, an Egyptian national and a dentist in California. He wasdetained by the FBI on September 13th and transferred to the Brooklyn DetentionCenter in New York City. The Journal said it was a month before his lawyer wasable to locate and talk to him.81 Some seven months after 9/11 Judge ShiraScheindlin ruled that a Jordanian student had been “unlawfully detained” byAshcroft’s Injustice Department because, like so many, he had been jailed purelyto ensure that he gives evidence to a grand jury. The judge said that “… since1789, no Congress had granted the government the authority to imprison aninnocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grand juryconducting a criminal investigation”.82 Ashcroft, of course, said he wouldappeal. Not to me he doesn’t. We don’t know how many innocent people have beendetained in America without trial or charge since 9/11 because Ashcroft’soperation has refused to say how many have been jailed without charge or trial,and on what basis. The public have no idea who they are, where they are or inwhat conditions they are being kept. A look at the disgraceful, inhuman,treatment of the uncharged, untried, inmates at the US military base at “CampX-Ray” at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, however, will probably give you a fair idea ofthe indignity to which they are subjected. As Groucho Marx said: “Militaryjustice is to justice what military music is to music.” This is America, the“Land of the Free”? What an illusion. All this when members of the bin Ladenfamily were allowed to leave Boston Airport for Saudi Arabia just days after9/11 with no problem at all because of their friends in high places likePresident Bush.Britain’s fascist state rolls onIn Britain, the Blair government and his “socialist” Home Secretary DavidBlunkett have also been sweeping away still more freedoms and civil liberties.Blunkett, the one-time “left-wing radical” on Sheffield council, is now justanother cap-touching establishment puppet. How the mighty fall. Following theIlluminati script after 9/11, the Blair government now allows foreign-born“terrorist suspects” to be detained without trial, a move described by the civilrights group Liberty as “a fundamental violation of the rule of law”.83Internment without trial breaches the European Convention on Human Rights andthis can only be overridden if a state of emergency is declared. So what didBlair and Blunkett do? They declared a state of emergency, thus bypassingArticle 5 of the Convention. The UK has jailed “terrorist suspects” on noevidence whatsoever. Lotfi Raissi, a 27-year-old Algerian pilot, was arresteddays after September 11th and accused by the FBI – yes, them again – of trainingpilots involved in the attacks. He was jailed by the British authorities in ahigh-security prison for five months while extradition proceedings took place tohand him over to the American government. But on February 12th 2002, a judgereleased him because the FBI had produced nothing to back up its ludicrousclaims. The FBI said he was an Islamic fundamentalist when he is married to awhite Roman Catholic! His wife and brother lost their jobs because of thiscriminal injustice and his brother Mohammed said: “They’ve destroyed his life,his future and his dream.” 84 But rather than accept they were wrong, apologiseand pay him compensation, the American government announced that they wouldstill continue to pursue his extradition on two counts of falsifying anapplication for a United States pilot’s licence. One of these involves failingto declare an old tennis injury! My God, these are the people “investigating”9/11 and telling us what happened. Fortunately a judge later dismissed the USclaims, and Raissi and his family were left to pick up the pieces of theirshattered lives.Tony Blair has long targeted civil liberties. He has sought to reduce the numberof trials for UK citizens that are heard by a jury, and laws were passed longbefore 9/11 to erode rights to data privacy and other freedoms. Blair is anIlluminati gofer. They put him in power and they have kept him there, soobviously you would expect him to slavishly pursue their agenda, as he has onevery front. New “anti-terrorist” laws mean that telecommunications companiesare instructed, under the guise of “national security”, to keep data on phonecalls, faxes and e-mails. Britain already has more surveillance cameras per headof population than anywhere else in the world and I saw one school featured in aBBC children’s television documentary that had installed nearly 40 cameras andthe children couldn’t move without being followed on a TV screen. All this isensuring that children grow up surrounded by surveillance and accept the BigBrother society as part of everyday life. New laws have increased the rights ofgovernment agencies to spy on the population’s financial transactions and freeze“suspected” terrorist funds. Who decides who is “suspected”? They do of course.Freedom, R.I.PNine months after September 11th it emerged that the Blair government wasplanning devastating advances in the Big Brother fascist state through somethingcalled the Regulation of Investigatory Powers, or R.I.P, Act. The Guardiannewspaper revealed that ministers proposed to dramatically expand the number ofpeople and organisations who could demand to be given personal data on thepopulation. The police, intelligence services, Customs & Excise and the InlandRevenue already had these powers, but the Blair government planned to increasethe list to include seven government departments, every local council in thecountry, any fire authority, the National Health Service in Scotland andNorthern Ireland, and 11 other public bodies. These organisations would be ableto demand, without a court order, that phone companies, Internet serviceproviders and postal operators give them details of a person’s phone calls, thesource and destination of e-mails, the identity of websites they have visitedand the location of their mobile phones, which would reveal the location of theuser to within a few hundred yards.85 The government said these expanded powerswere needed to “fight terrorism”. Clearly this is an outrageous lie. JohnWadham, director of the human rights organisation, Liberty, said: “This listdemonstrates an issue that many people may not have realised: it is not just thepolice who will be looking at our communications records, it is practicallyevery public servant who will be able to play this game.” 86 Ian Brown, directorof the Foundation for Information Policy Research, said he was appalled at “thishuge increase in the scope of government snooping” and how these powers werebeing handed to “a practically endless queue of bureaucrats in Whitehall andtown halls”.87 Simon Davies, director of Privacy International, said:> “The Home Office has absolutely breached its commitment that this law would> not become a general surveillance power for the government. The exhaustive> list of organisations who will be able to access data without a court order> proves that this amounts to a systematic attack on the right to privacy.” 88The laws have fundamental implications for journalists and Internet users andservers. Steve Rawlinson, Chief Technical Officer of Claranet, said it dealtwith a lot of requests from the police for private information, but many ofthese were a “fishing expedition” and they told the police they were notsatisfied there were sufficient grounds. The new laws meant they would have nochoice but to hand over private data. Journalists complained that they would nolonger be able to keep their sources private, but most of them should havethought of that when they were ridiculing those who were telling them this wascoming. Maybe they will now wake up to the fact that the fascist conspiracy theyhave been ridiculing and claiming does not exist is targeting them and theirchildren as much as anyone else. Home Secretary David Blunkett had the nerve topropose these new laws after pledging in the wake of September 11th that hewould not give anyone the power to routinely monitor phone calls or e-mailsbetween individuals. In the summer of 2002 Blunkett also announced laws thatforce airlines to provide the government with details of every passenger theycheck-in on an international flight, including the name, address and passportnumber. The airlines said this would create chaos and massively increase thequeues for check-in. But why should Blunkett and company care? While the peopleare queuing, they’ll be in the VIP lounge.“Airy fairy” freedomsThe response of the Ashcrofts and Blunketts to legitimate concerns about theloss of basic freedoms has been depressingly predictable. It’s an old, old,technique: don’t address the concerns in an adult way as part of your duty as apublic servant – seek to discredit those who question and challenge your role asa public dictator. Blunkett called the concerns of civil rights campaigners“airy fairy” and, employing the usual technique of painting a polarised pictureof black vs white, he said in a television interview on London WeekendTelevision: “We could live in a world which is airy fairy, libertarian, whereeverybody does precisely what they like and we believe the best of everybody andthen they destroy us.” 89 That, of course, is not what freedom campaigners aresuggesting, and Blunkett knows it. But he says that simply to discredit thosewho challenge his decisions and to present a false picture of the situation tothe public. The UK Foreign Secretary Jack “straw man” Straw, a man I would nottrust to run a market stall, said that “naïve” campaigners against strongerInternet surveillance laws have hurt the anti-terrorism campaign. If you don’tsupport what we demand and accept without question the erosion of your ownfreedoms, you are helping terrorists. Straw also sought to justify thedismantling of freedom when he told the media: “The most fundamental civilliberty is the right to life and preserving that and sustaining that must comebefore others.” 90 This is the same Straw who was a vehement supporter of thebombing of Afghanistan that killed thousands more civilians than the attacks inAmerica. Brain-cell activity never was an essential criteria for being apolitician, in fact it can be a serious handicap to career advancement. Thenthere was one Kevin Hughes, a member of Blair’s Labour Party, who said duringthe steam-rollered parliamentary “debate” on the anti-terrorism laws thatopponents of the plan were from the … “yoghurt-eating, muesli-eating,Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing fraternity”.91 What a prat. In the US, ofcourse, Attorney General Ashcroft takes the same line. When challenged on hisattacks on basic freedoms, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee:> “To those who pit Americans against immigrants, citizens against non-citizens,> to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my> message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists for they erode our national> unity and diminish our resolve … They give ammunition to America’s enemies and> pause to America’s friends. They encourage people of good will to remain> silent in the face of evil.” 92More black is white, more smoke and mirrors. Orrin Hatch, the aspartamesupporter and senator for the Illuminati Mormon stronghold of Utah, told hiscolleagues on the committee that criticism of White House plans was nothing morethan “Senate egos”. He said: “I would implore my colleagues, let’s keep ourfocus where it matters: on protecting our citizens.” 93 Yeah, yeah, OK, Orrin,you’ve done your job and I’m sure they will be very pleased with you. SenatorRussell Feingold was the lone vote in the Senate against this silent invasion byfederal and state dictatorship. He provided confirmation that at least somecommon sense and principle still survives – just, only just – in Washington. Hesaid:> “If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search your home at any> time for any reason, if we lived in a country that allowed the government to> open your mail, eavesdrop on phone conversations, intercept your e-mail> communications, hold people in jail indefinitely on suspicion that they were> up to no good, then the government would no doubt discover and arrest more> terrorists. But that would probably not be a country in which we would want to> live. That would not be a country in which we could, in good conscience, ask> our young people to die for. In short, that country wouldn’t be America.” 94Such voices of sanity are so few. In the US Congress, the British Parliament,and their like across the world, fundamental attacks on freedom went throughwith hardly a murmur of serious challenge from politicians or public – allthanks to 9/11. Coincidence?Bush hides daddy’s secrets … and his ownBut get this: while the Bush government was issuing an explosion of new laws anddirectives to gather ever more information about the population and impose evergreater surveillance, he took time out on November 1st 2001 to issue anExecutive Order that gives Bush and former presidents (like his father) theright to veto requests to open any presidential records. Even if a formerpresident wants his records to be released, the Executive Order permitsPresident Bush or any sitting president to assert executive privilege to stopthis, and Boy George and former presidents are now given an indefinite amount oftime to ponder any requests. This is a blatant move to hide the grotesquesecrets of his father, other presidents and himself, particularly, in his case,in relation to 9/11. How coincidental, too, that this was invoked just asrecords of the Reagan-Bush administration were due for release under thePresidential Records Act, a post-Watergate law intended to ensure the release ofadministration records 12 years after a president leaves office.95So who benefits?What happened on September 11th was the most glaring and obvious example I haveseen of the technique I have dubbed problem-reaction-solution. 9/11 had everyelement in enormous abundance. First you covertly create the problem andimmediately name the person or people “responsible” to divert attention from anyopen-minded speculation or questioning about who was really behind it. Second,you report the problem through the media in the form that you wish the public tobelieve. Third, you offer the solution to your problem amid the manipulatedpublic clamour for you to “do something”. The atrocities in America, and theiraftermath, have provided an excuse for an open-ended problem-reaction-solutionin the form of the “war on terrorism”. How can you tell when you have won a waron terrorism? You can’t. They have launched a war without end in which they canattack any country or target they can demonise as either “terrorists” or“supporters of terrorists”. That was the idea. As British Prime Minister TonyBlair said immediately after September 11th:> “This is a moment to seize. The kaleidoscope has been shaken, the pieces are> in flux, soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us reorder this> world around us.”And on September 12th, at a televised event organised by theRockefeller-Illuminati Council on Foreign Relations, the former presidentialcandidate Gary Hart said:> “There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster> to carry out … a phrase his father used … and that is a New World Order.”That phrase was delivered in a speech by Father George in relation to the Gulf“War” on September 11th 1990 – 11 years to the day before 9/11. As I said in theopening chapter, the antidote to P-R-S is the question: “Who benefits?” Thisalways reveals the force behind the “problem”. Who benefits from 9/11? One groupand one group alone – anyone who wants a massive increase in surveillance andcontrol of the people, individually and collectively; the further centralisationof global power; a systematic destruction of basic freedoms and civil liberties;an excuse to invade, devastate and take over any country they choose to target;and a fantastic increase in public spending on the military for operations athome and aboard. Whoever was behind 9/11 has achieved all of these aims and somuch more. Who wants such a society? The Illuminati and their agents ingovernment, as I have been exposing for more than a decade. They wantcentralisation of power in all areas of our lives until the world government,central bank, currency, army, police force, intelligence agency, andmicro-chipped population are in place. They want an excuse to send their armiesinto any country whose regime is not playing ball, or whose land and resourcesthey desire to control. One event has given them all of these things sinceSeptember 11th 2001. Are we really to believe that those two facts are notconnected, that all this is all mere “coincidence”? Are we really?I was interviewed on a Los Angeles radio station in the days after 9/11 by acouple of hosts who were not the sharpest pins in the box to say the least. Isaid that the attacks had been organised within their own borders by Illuminatigroups that control the federal government and the military, and that they wouldsoon see new laws introduced by that same federal government that would removefundamental freedoms from American society. The idea that agencies of the UnitedStates government could have been involved in the attacks against Americanpeople was more than their neuron pathways could process and the hosts decidedthat I must either be “mad” or “on something”. So I made them an offer to comeback on the show a month later and I said that if massive erosions of freedomhad not occurred in America by then I would hold my hand up and say I was wrong.They said OK, it was a deal; they would call me in a month. The erosions offreedom duly took place.They never called.SOURCES > 1Boston Globe, September 23rd 2001> http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm#aa11> [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm#aa11]> 2http://professor2222.tripod.com/Flight-93/Flight93.htm> [http://professor2222.tripod.com/Flight-93/Flight93.htm]> 3NORAD website: http://www.spacecom.af.mil/norad> [http://www.spacecom.af.mil/norad]> 4Boston Globe, September 23rd 2001> 5http://professor2222.tripod.com/Flight-93/Flight93.htm> [http://professor2222.tripod.com/Flight-93/Flight93.htm]> 6Boston Globe, September 23rd 2001> 7Ibid> 8Ibid> 9Ibid> 10http://www.flightexplorer.com/ [http://www.flightexplorer.com/] and> http://www.flightexplorer.com/FastTrack.asp> [http://www.flightexplorer.com/FastTrack.asp]> 11http://www.usatoday.com/graphics/news/gra/gflightpath2/frame.htm> [http://www.usatoday.com/graphics/news/gra/gflightpath2/frame.htm]> 12See alleged transcript of air traffic communications with Flight 77 in> Appendix 3 [../Text/index_split_030.html#filepos1987380]> 13Washington Post, September 12th 2001> 14Ibid> 15Boston Globe, September 23rd 2001> 16Ibid> 17http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/33577.html> [http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/33577.html] reporting the original story in> the Boston Globehttp://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/33577.html> [http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/33577.html]> 18Ibid> 19Ibid> 20Ibid> 21Ibid> 22Ibid> 23The Orlando Sentinel, September 11th 2001> http://www.dominionpost.com/af/terrorstrikesus/2001/09/11/0w> [http://www.dominionpost.com/af/terrorstrikesus/2001/09/11/0w]> 24Ibid> 25Ibid> 26Ibid> 27http://hometown.aol.com/estrellaberosin/page1Analysis911Facts.html> [http://hometown.aol.com/estrellaberosin/page1Analysis911Facts.html]> 28http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/2001/10/01/bush.family.html> [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/2001/10/01/bush.family.html]> 29When Our World Changed Forever, Observer, September 16th 2001> 30Ibid> 31Ibid> 32http://www.dal.net/wtc/victims.html [http://www.dal.net/wtc/victims.html]> 33Bush Says No to New Taliban Offer for Talks, Los Angeles Times, October 15th> 2001> 34US Department of State Office of the Spokesman, September 12th 2001,> Washington, DC, on-the-record Briefing by Secretary of State Colin L.

BushThe official story of what happened on that horrific day in the autumn of 2001is an obvious and transparent fantasy, and the atrocities of September 11th wereyet another version of Oklahoma and Pearl Harbor.All of these attacks (and so, so, many more) were not only made to happen theywere allowed to happen and this is the combination you see in all theseIlluminati stings. They arrange for their agents in government, the intelligencenetwork, the military, and terrorist groups to execute the plan. At the sametime they ensure that the plan is allowed to happened through lax security, andthat those who are truly responsible are never named, let alone caught. Ideallyyou want both the execution of the plan and the “failed security” to involve thesame organisation because that provides optimum efficiency and potential forcover-up. So, often, you find that the perpetrators and those protecting theperpetrators are actually the same people. The evidence is clear that theattacks of September 11th were allowed to happen. Colonel Leroy Fletcher Proutyspent a long career in the US Air Force and special operations in which he washeavily involved with the CIA, then led by its notorious first director AllenDulles. Prouty later wrote and lectured about some of these clandestineoperations and authored the book, JFK, The CIA, Vietnam And The Plot ToAssassinate John F. Kennedy.1 The Donald Sutherland character called “X” in theOliver Stone movie JFK was apparently based to an extent on Prouty. This guyoperated for decades in the shadowy world from which came the real orchestratorsof 9/11. Fletcher Prouty said:> “No one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is played> secretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has> the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions?” 2If you look at the evidence detailed in books by myself and others, FletcherProuty’s words are true in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, his brotherBobby, Martin Luther King, Princess Diana, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme … the list could go on for pages. The same isalso true of September 11th.NORAD and Cheyenne MountainThe organisation charged with the task of protecting North American airspace inboth the United States and Canada is NORAD, the North American Areospace DefenseCommand, headquartered at the Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado with itsoperational centre in the nearby Rocky Mountains. This was the organisation thatdid nothing to prevent the attacks while all hell was happening in the skiesover America on September 11th, and it is important to look in some depth at itsbackground and capabilities. NORAD was created by an agreement signed by the USand Canadian governments on May 12th 1958. NORAD’s brief, to quote its ownwebsite, involves:> “… the monitoring of man-made objects in space, and the detection, validation,> and warning of attack against North America whether by aircraft, missiles, or> space vehicles, utilizing mutual support arrangements with other commands.> Aerospace control includes ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the> airspace of Canada and the United States.” 3NORAD has an agreement with the civilian Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)to respond to civil aviation emergencies when commercial aircraft are hijacked,lose contact with air traffic controllers, or stray off-course. What happened on9/11, therefore, was exactly what NORAD is there to deal with. The President ofthe United States and the Prime Minister of Canada officially appoint NORAD’scommander. This means, of course, that the President of the United Statesappoints him. Again quoting the NORAD website: “Cheyenne Mountain serves as acentral collection and coordination facility for a worldwide system of sensorsdesigned to provide … the leadership of Canada and the US with an accuratepicture of any aerospace threat.” 4 Ah yes, Cheyenne Mountain. It was not longinto my research of the global conspiracy in 1992 that I first came acrossCheyenne Mountain in Colorado. There have been many mysterious animalmutilations in that area, including some at the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Zoo,and researchers into “UFO” activity have long had their eyes on the CheyenneMountain complex. What we do know for sure is that this is the vast super-secretheadquarters for the “defence” of North America and was the early warning andresponse centre during the (manufactured) “Cold War” with the Soviet Union. Itis also the location of so much more that we are not told about.The complex is mounted on more than 1,300 half-ton springs that allow it to swayup to a foot horizontally in any direction should it be struck by an earthquakeor nuclear attack. The two main doors consist of 25 tons of baffled steel, threefeet thick, and the complex is located 2,000 feet inside the granite mountain.In the same region are other major military and technology centres like Ent AirForce Base, Fort Carson Army Base, Peterson Airfield, Lowry Air Force bombingrange, the US Air Force Academy, the Buckley Air National Guard and Naval AirStation, and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. A Scripps Howard News Service surveyreported in 1998 that about 7,000 people were employed within Cheyenne Mountainand that spending on the facility was substantially increased by the best partof $2 billion after the “Cold War” was over.5 This would seem to be a strangecontradiction if you didn’t know that the massive network of underground basesand the tunnel systems that connect them across the United States are not thereprimarily to protect the population at all. Their role is to control thepopulation. Inside Cheyenne Mountain are some of the most brillianttechnological minds in the world using and developing technology that is lightyears ahead of anything you will see in the public arena. It is a big mistake tojudge what is possible only on the basis of technology you know about. Theseguys aren’t working with that.The following information comes from the official Cheyenne Mountain website6 andrepresents only a fraction of what really goes on there. The excavation ofCheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs began in May 1961 and was completed inaround a year, according to the official story. The NORAD command centre waslocated here and became fully operational on April 20th 1966 when its dutieswere transferred from Ent Air Force Base, also in Colorado. NORAD has since beenjoined inside Cheyenne Mountain by other “early warning and response”organisations with the responsibility for defending North America from airattack. One is the Air Force Space Command that is supposed to provideprotection from space and missile attack, and this operates the Space DefenseOperations Center. Personnel at the Space Defense Operations Center and “theirworldwide sensors, under the direction of Air Defense Command”, supported thefirst flight of the space shuttle in April 1981.7 Cheyenne Mountain hascontinued to support every shuttle mission since. General Ralph E. Eberhart, thecommander of NORAD at the time of 9/11, was also commander of Space Command andhe took over on February 18th 2000 from General Richard B. Myers who becameDeputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, and Chairmanimmediately after 9/11. Eberhart and Myers also both served at the “CIA” AirForce Base at Langley, Virginia, from where, it is claimed, jets were scrambled(far too late) to intercept Flight 77 as it headed for Washington. Eberhart wasCommander, Air Combat Command, from June 1999 to February 2000 when he replacedMyers at NORAD. More about Myers’ behaviour on September 11th in due course. Iam going to detail at some length the capabilities of the Cheyenne Mountaincomplex for reasons that will become very clear. This is what its officialwebsite says about the NORAD operations today, and the information is highlyrevealing in the light of the events – or non-events – of September 11th:> “The Air Defense Operations Center uses its air defense network to provide> surveillance and control of air operations to North America and unknown> traffic. Today the NORAD Combat Operations Center has evolved into the> Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center that collects data from a worldwide system> of satellites, radars, and other sensors and processes that information on> sophisticated computer systems to support critical NORAD and US Space Command> missions. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center provides warning of> ballistic missile or air attacks against North America, assists the air> sovereignty mission for the United States and Canada, and, if necessary, is> the focal point for air defense operations to counter enemy bombers or cruise> missiles.> “In support of the US Space Command mission, the Cheyenne Mountain Operations> Center provides a day-to-day picture of precisely what is in space and where> it is located. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center also supports space> operations, providing critical information such as collision avoidance data> for space shuttle flights and troubleshooting satellite interference problems.> Since the Persian Gulf War, the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center has> continued to play a vital and expanding role in supporting our deployed forces> with warning for short-range ballistic missiles such as the Iraqi Scuds.> Cheyenne Mountain operations are conducted by six centers manned 24 hours a> day, 365 days a year. The centers are: Command Center, Air Defense Operations> Center, Missile Warning Center, Space Control Center, Combined Intelligence> Watch Center, and the Systems Center.”And it goes on:> “The Command Center is the heart of operations in Cheyenne Mountain. In this> center, the Command Director and his crew serve as the NORAD and US Space> Command Commander in Chief’s direct representatives for monitoring,> processing, and interpreting missile, space or air events which could have> operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could be potential> threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas. The Command Center> is linked directly to the National Command Authorities of both the US and> Canada as well as to regional command centers overseas. When required, the> Command Director must consult directly with the NORAD and US Space Command> Commander in Chief for time-critical assessments of missile, air, and space> events; he takes action to ensure the Commander in Chief’s response and> direction are properly conveyed and executed …> “… The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the air> surveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they> monitored over 700 ‘unknown’ radar tracks entering North American airspace.> Many of these were subsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred> from flight plans or used improper procedures. Yet nearly 100 were identified> as illegal drug-carrying aircraft that were subsequently prosecuted by the US> and Canadian Drug Enforcement Agencies.” 8The technology located within Cheyenne Mountain is the state of the state of thestate of the art. Its website explains how the Missile Warning Center employs a“worldwide sensor and communications network to provide warning of missileattacks, either long or short range, launched against North America or ourforces overseas”. So much so that its technology provides information “regardingmissile launches anywhere on earth which are detected by the strategic missilewarning system and which could be a potential threat to Canada or the US”. TheSpace Control Center at Cheyenne Mountain, opened in March 1994, has the highlysophisticated technology that “supports the space control missions of spacesurveillance and protection of our assets in space” and its primary objective isto perform “the surveillance mission … to detect, track, identify, and catalogall man-made objects in space”. The Center has a computerised catalogue of “allorbiting space objects, charts objects, charts present position, plots futureorbital paths, and forecasts times and general locations for significant objectsre-entering the Earth’s atmosphere.” The website tells us that the Space ControlCenter is currently tracking some 8,000 “on-orbit objects”, and this informationis used to provide NASA with collision avoidance information during spaceflights. Cheyenne Mountain is also home to the Combined Intelligence Watch,which serves as North America’s “indications and warning center for worldwidethreats from space, missile, and strategic air activity, as well as geopoliticalunrest that could affect North America and US forces/interests abroad”.9 Putanother way, they have a satellite surveillance network that could read yourlicence plate from space wherever you may be. The Combined Intelligence Watch“gathers intelligence information to assist all the Cheyenne Mountain workcenters in correlating and analyzing events to support NORAD and US SpaceCommand decision makers”.10 There is a Systems Center that “ensures continuityof operations throughout the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center by providingcommunications and computer systems management for over 100 computer systems and600 communications circuits in support of NORAD and US Space Command missilewarning, space control, and air defense missions”.11“Most unique installation”Cheyenne Mountain calls itself one of the most unique installations in the worldand is the likely command centre for the “Star Wars” satellite network sobeloved of both the Bushes and Reagan (the Bushes). The complex has thepotential for massive cooperation and coordination between apparentlyunconnected organisations because it employs staff from the Army, Navy, Marine,Air Force and Canadian Forces. Cheyenne Mountain operates military communicationand navigation satellites that direct and guide “western” armies during theirbombardments of Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Major Mike Birmingham, an Armyspokesman for the Colorado base, said: “Space support basically allowed USforces to perform that famous ‘left hook’ operation [employed during the GulfWar]. The Iraqis assumed no one could navigate that well in the desert.”12 But,despite all of this amazing technology and response capability, four commercialairliners hijacked in American airspace proved too much for them on September11th. Why? If anyone is still in any doubt about the technological andcoordination capability we are talking about here and its instant communicationsnetwork throughout the United States government, military and air trafficsurveillance, the official Cheyenne Mountain website says:> “The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center comprises the largest and most> complex command and control network in the world. The system uses satellites,> microwave radio routes, and fiber optic links to transmit and receive vital> communications. Two blast-hardened microwave antennas and two underground> coaxial cables transmit the bulk of electronic information. Most of this> information is data sent from the worldwide space surveillance and warning> network directly to computers inside the Mountain. Redundant and survivable> communications hotlines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon, White> House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa, other> aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers around the> world.” 13Now take a deep breath and consider the following. This was the veryorganisation that failed to respond in time to the hijacking of four commercialairliners in American airspace over densely populated areas between 8.13am, whencommunication was lost with Flight 11, and at least 9.38 when Flight 77 crashedinto the Pentagon. That’s around an hour and a half and not one NORAD plane wasable (so they tell us) to intercept any of the hijacked aircraft in the veryairspace its fantastic technology is specifically there to monitor and protect.Flight 77 alone, the one that hit the Pentagon, was in the air for 80 minutesand is officially reported to have performed a U-turn from its authorised coursemore than 40 minutes before impact.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)Another point to emphasise is that the civilian (US government) Federal AviationAdministration, which has a joint response procedure with NORAD to respond tohijackings, is a monumentally corrupt organisation steeped in the culture of thecover-up. I am not referring to most of the employees, nor even those who tellthe media what the high-ups tell them to say. I am speaking of the controllingcore of the FAA. Rodney Stich, a former navy and airline pilot and crashinvestigator with the FAA, has widely documented some of the corruption that heexperienced directly and through his own investigations. He is the author of thebook Unfriendly Skies14 and he reveals the following:> •FAA management personnel have refused to take action when faced with major> air safety and criminal violations reported by air safety inspectors.> •FAA management warns federal air safety inspectors not to report air safety> problems or air safety violations.> •Official government air safety reports of major air safety problems and air> safety violations filed by federal air safety inspectors are destroyed.> •FAA management harass, threaten and retaliate against federal air safety> inspectors who try to report or carry out the federal government’s air safety> responsibilities.> •Key federal air safety inspectors are removed from their government air> safety duties to stop them from reporting and taking actions on serious air> safety problems or air safety violations.> •FAA management encourages inspectors to ignore major air safety problems by> providing outstanding performance ratings, financial bonuses and promotions to> those inspectors who don’t report these problems, while doing the opposite to> those inspectors who do report the problems and try to address them.> •FAA management has covered up crash-causing air safety misconduct exposed by> FAA inspectors who have produced official government reports of corruption> within the FAA in relation to a series of fatal airline crashes. More than> 4,000 pages of hearing transcript exist supporting charges of corrupt and> criminal activities within the FAA with regard to a series of fatal airline> crashes.15> •An FAA administrator covered up testimony and dozens of government documents> supporting charges of corruption within the FAA relating to fatal airline> crashes, including a United Airlines DC-8 crash into New York City.Stich is also particularly scathing about the management of United Airlines. Hesays that the information about FAA corruption has repeatedly been given to the“politically appointed” National Transportation Safety Board, but it had beencovered up and “fraud-related” air disasters were allowed to continue. Heaccused the Board of “falsifying accident reports that covered up for their ownduplicity in the crashes and deaths”.16 Stich cites the FBI, US attorneys and“the main Justice Department personnel” as other people and government agencieswho have been given the facts about FAA corruption involving major aircraftdisasters, but ignored it and even retaliated against him and other formerfederal agents who tried to expose what was happening. He names the federaljudges he says have blocked his efforts to expose FAA corruption through thecourts.17 He tells the same story about members of Congress who, he says,ignored the documented evidence of “hard-core corruption” within the FAA:> “These are the same members of Congress, and the secretary of the Department> of Transportation, whose crocodile tears cover up for the fact that they were> repeatedly offered evidence of the corruption that resulted in a series of> fatal airline crashes, fatal hijackings, and who helped insure the success of> the September 11, 2001, terrorist hijackers. The cover-up of these matters by> members of Congress following the September 11 tragedies will insure the> protection of the guilty and continuation of the tragic consequences, as> documented for the past 40 years in the books described at this site.” 18This is the same corrupt network that is telling you what happened when thoseplanes were hijacked on September 11th. It is also the organisation that, withNORAD and the Pentagon, was responsible for responding to what happened thatday.The case of Payne StewartAn example of the FAA-NORAD reaction procedure can be seen in the case of theprivate Learjet carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and his friends on October25th 1999. Air traffic controllers lost contact with Stewart’s plane after ittook off from Orlando in Florida heading for Dallas. When air trafficcontrollers realised all was not well, the FAA contacted NORAD and fighter jetswere scrambled to check out what was happening. The Learjet had suffered apressurisation failure and was flying on autopilot while the real pilot andpassengers were unconscious. An ABC News report, quoting the Air Force butdiffering slightly from the findings of the official investigation, said thatafter contact was initially lost, two F-15s from Tyndall Air Force Base inFlorida were sent to track the Learjet. The F-15s pulled back and two F-16s inthe air from Florida’s Eglin Air Force Base took over. When the Learjet reachedthe Midwest, the Eglin F-16s withdrew and four F-16s and a mid-air refuellingtanker from the Tulsa National Guard replaced them. Finally, two F-16s fromFargo, North Dakota, moved in close to look into the windows to see if the pilotwas slumped over and to help clear airspace. “Officials hoped that the F-16scould provide assistance to anyone on board who might have helped land the planesafely”, said ABC.19 When the Learjet ran out of fuel, the F-16 pilots said theysaw the plane fall to the ground. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said theNational Security Council monitored the doomed flight, fearing the jet mightcrash in a populated area. President Bill Clinton could have ordered fighters toshoot down the Learjet to avoid that potential tragedy, but Lockhart said nosuch recommendation had been made. Clinton told reporters at the time: “I amvery grateful for the work the FAA did, and for the two Air Force pilots, andthe others in the Air Force that monitored this plane and made every effort totry to make contact with it.”20Another important point to note. If you were “highly trained” Arab terroristsfrom this “brilliantly organised” network of Osama bin Laden, a network we aretold was capable of hijacking four commercial aircraft at the same time inAmerican airspace, one of your obvious and fundamental calculations would be thepossible NORAD reaction time once it was known that the planes had been seized.So why did they choose to hijack the planes that hit the World Trade Center inBoston with a flight time to New York well in excess of possible NORAD reactiontime and why would they have Flight 77 and 93 fly way out towards the Midwestbefore turning around and going all the way back? In the case of Flight 77 itmeant that they had to fly for 45 minutes from the time the plane was known tobe hijacked to the moment it struck the Pentagon. By any criteria, and the mostminimal study of NORAD and FAA procedures on the Internet, they would have knownthat Air Force jets would be scrambled. They would also have known that theseprocedures involved the possible shooting down of aircraft that threaten UScities. Any idiot putting this plan together, with the aim of crashing planesinto the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, would have known that underNORAD’s normal, every-other-day, reaction times, they would have to complete themission as soon as possible. Taking off from New York and Washington, andcrashing them immediately into those buildings would have been the ideal planfor them, surely? Instead, Flight 77, which actually took off from Washington,was allowed to fly away from the city for around three quarters of an hourbefore the hijack happened and then had to be flown all the way back! This isclearly ridiculous. But, of course, if those behind the attacks knew that NORADwould not be reacting that day, these details would no longer be a problem orhave to be taken into account when planning the operation.NORAD’s no-showWith the fantastic technology available to NORAD and the Cheyenne Mountainoperation in general, reacting to what happened on September 11th should nothave been a problem. In the past 20 years the technology has been introducedthat allows aircraft to be safely navigated and communicated with from almostanywhere on or above the earth, thanks to the satellite network known as theGlobal Positioning System (GPS). This was created for use by the US militaryand, says one article, provides “incredibly accurate position information to endusers”.21 I’ll just give you that again: it provides “incredibly accurateposition information to end users”. Who controls this system? NORAD and the restof the gang at Cheyenne Mountain. Yet they could not track those hijacked planesand follow what was going on? Besides all the ground-based and satellite basedsensors and surveillance, NORAD also directs the AWACS aircraft which are in theair 24 hours a day, refuelling from flying tankers. AWACS (airborne warning andcontrol system) are a modified Boeing airframe from a 707/320 with the 30-footrotating radar dome on the top. They are the premier “air battle command andcontrol” aircraft in the world today. They provide surveillance to NORAD fromthe earth’s surface to the stratosphere over land and water, and one wasinvolved in the Payne Stewart case.22 The AWACS radar has a range of more than250 miles (375.5 kilometres) for low-flying targets and further for those athigher altitudes. It has a “friend or foe” identification system that candetect, identify and track friendly or “enemy” low-flying aircraft byeliminating “ground clutter” that can confuse other radar systems.23 There is,to put it mildly, no credible excuse imaginable for what happened – or ratherdidn’t – on 9/11.What should have happenedThe system for what should have happened is made very clear in the officialregulations and procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).24Chapter 7 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos678856] of the procedures dealswith the “escort of hijacked aircraft”. It says that an FAA “hijack coordinator”on duty at the Washington DC headquarters will request the military to providean escort aircraft for a confirmed hijacked plane to: (a) assure positive flightfollowing (that’s staying on the authorised course to you and me); (b) reportunusual observances; and (c) aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency.The escort service, say the regulations, will be requested by the FAA hijackcoordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC)at the Pentagon. Normally NORAD escort aircraft will take the required action,it says. “The center/control tower shall coordinate with the designated NORAD …military unit advising of the hijack aircraft’s location, direction of flight,altitude, type of aircraft and recommended flight plan to intercept the hijackaircraft”, the document instructs. Escort aircraft are told to positionthemselves five miles directly behind the hijacked plane and to approach it fromthe rear to avoid the possibility of being observed. The escort plane shouldtake the same altitude, speed and heading as the hijacked aircraft. When ahijacking happens within the continental United States, say the procedures, the“appropriate NORAD … Senior Director” is forwarded reports of the aircraft’scall sign of position of latitude and longitude, heading, speed and altitude. Anescort mission can be terminated by FAA headquarters, the National MilitaryCommand Center at the Pentagon or major military command authority – in otherwords NORAD.25 Air traffic controllers can, through the Federal AviationAdministration, call for military planes to escort or “intercept” a commercialaircraft if contact is lost with the pilot, the plane strays from its designatedcourse or anything inexplicable is happening. In 2000, NORAD scrambled jets 125times in such circumstances. An intercept does not require the approval of thePresident or some high-up government official. It is a routine response to checkwhat is going on and who is flying the plane. The intention is not to blow theplane from the sky, which would have needed presidential approval or, since9/11, the approval of the head of NORAD and other designated military chiefs.There is an agreed procedure and code for communicating between interceptingNORAD jets and the commercial aircraft. For example:> “Rocking wings from a position slightly above and ahead of, and normally to> the left of, the intercepted aircraft and, after acknowledgement, a slow level> turn, normally to the left, on to the desired heading = You have been> intercepted, follow me; circling aerodrome, lowering landing gear and over> flying runway in direction of landing … = Land at this aerodrome.”26There is, likewise, a series of coded replies for the other aircraft. If thehijacked plane does not follow these orders, the interceptor can “make a pass infront of the aircraft” and eventually “fire tracer rounds in the airplane’spath” or “down it with a missile”, according to Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder,a NORAD spokesman quoted in the Boston Globe.27 He also confirmed that fighters’intercepting aircraft was “routine”. For example, after 9/11 when a smallprivate Cessna flew near to President Bush’s ranch at Crawford, Texas, theFederal Aviation Administration activated a response through NORAD and two jetswere dispatched immediately. They tuned to the pilot’s frequency and ordered himto land. Another similar incident was reported in Wood County, Texas, whereRodney Mize, the Sheriff’s senior Dispatcher, confirmed that a private planecarrying four reporters from the Houston Chronicle was forced down by twomilitary pilots in A-10 Warthog jets. They flew above and below the plane and itlanded at Wisener Field near Mineola.28 Bush’s ranch, it seems, is far moreimportant than the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Such incidents arehappening week after week as the Federal Aviation Administration and NORADactivate the response system.The hijack procedureIf a problem with an aircraft is considered a possible hijack by the air trafficcontroller a much higher level of command is activated. FAA spokeswoman, AlisonDuquette, explained: “The air traffic controller would notify the supervisor onthe floor, who would then immediately notify the FAA’s regional operation centerwho would notify NORAD, as well as others.” 29 In these cases, according theregulations: “The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinatorby direct contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC) [based at thePentagon].” 30 The Defense Department (DOD) manual covering plane hijackingssays: “In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC will be notified by the mostexpeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediateresponses … forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense forapproval.” 31 It was because of this procedure that, according to CNN “…officers on [sic] the Joint Chiefs were monitoring the [Payne Stewart] Learjeton radar screens inside the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center”.32Federal Aviation Administration regulations leave air traffic controllers in nodoubt that they must never take chances. They are told that if there is anunexpected loss of radar or radio communication they must consider that “anaircraft emergency exists”…33 and … “If … you are in doubt that a situationconstitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though it were anemergency.” 34 Within Cheyenne Mountain at the NORAD headquarters is the AirDefense Liaison Officer, a top FAA official, who is there to coordinate betweenthe FAA and NORAD in these situations. All these personnel and procedures werein place on September 11th. Yet look at what happened.The NORAD timelineI asked both NORAD and the FAA for the sequence of events and the timeline forwhat occurred that morning. Both say that only at 8.40am did the FAA notifyNORAD that American Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked. Yet contact was lostwith the aircraft at 8.13 and at the very latest, by 8.20, it was clear thatsomething serious was wrong. We should know why it took up to 27 minutes,according to the official story, for Air Traffic Control through the FAA toalert NORAD. The New York Times reported that Flight 11 maintained itsauthorised course for only 16 minutes after take-off and “just past Worcester,Mass., instead of taking a southerly turn, the Boeing 767 swung to the north at8.15. It had been taken over …” 35 Let’s give the controllers another fiveminutes before they were sure the aircraft was in trouble. This still means thatthe FAA waited 20 minutes from the point of confirmed lost contact to reportthat a commercial airliner was not responding to instructions and had changedcourse with a deactivated transponder over an area of high population and inskies criss-crossed by intensive air traffic. I asked the FAA to confirm whenexactly it was known that Flight 11 was in trouble and why it took so long tocontact NORAD. The FAA spokesman would not answer.I repeat, the Federal Aviation Administration regulations instruct air trafficcontrollers that if there is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communicationthey must consider that “an aircraft emergency exists”… and …“If … you are indoubt that a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handleit as though it were an emergency.” This could not be clearer. For goodnesssake, the official story says that at 8.24am the controller heard from thecockpit of Flight 11: “We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK.We are returning to the airport. Nobody move.” That is said to have happened 16minutes before we are told the FAA alerted NORAD that the plane had beenhijacked! The transponder was switched off at 8.20 – 20 minutes before NORAD wasinformed, we are asked to believe. Let us not forget that through all of thisthe Air Force was constantly monitoring the commercial air traffic system as itdoes 24 hours a day. This has to be done to prevent collisions betweencommercial and Air Force planes. Flight attendant Betty Ong is said to have useda seatback phone to call an American Airlines reservations agent, who contactedthe system operations control centre in Fort Worth. Betty is said to have madethat call at 8.27 – 13 minutes before NORAD says it was told of the hijack. Evenfive minutes before the first alleged contact with NORAD, controllers areclaimed to have heard another cockpit transmission that said: “Nobody moveplease. We are going back to the airport. Don’t try to make any stupid moves.”This FAA-NORAD timeline therefore is simply ridiculous. NORAD says it scrambledfighter jets from the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod in Massachusetsat 8.46, six minutes after it says it was told of the hijack. At the very timethey were taking off, according to the NORAD timeline, Flight 11 was crashinginto the north tower. An F-15 departing from Otis can reach New York City in 10to 12 minutes, according to an Otis spokeswoman, and can fly three times thespeed of a 767.36 If you take it to be 10 minutes that means the jets would beflying at around 918 miles per hour, well within their top speed. A NORADspokesman, however, quoted the speed of the scrambled F-15s to me at onlybetween 603 and 675 miles per hour. Why not faster? One of the pilots, namedonly as “Duff”, told the BBC “documentary” Clear The Skies on September 1st 2002that they did fly supersonic and this statement added to the contradictionsemerging from different spokesmen for the US military.But wait. It gets sillier. The Pentagon told CNN that NORAD was “informed of theplane striking the World Trade Center at 8.47”. Informed? We are talking aboutthe most sophisticated military surveillance operation on the planet which, inits own words, is “the largest and most complex command and control network inthe world”, utilising a vast network of satellites and cutting-edge-air trackingand surveillance technology. Cheyenne Mountain can tell you if a missile hasbeen launched on the other side of the world and it has to be “informed” that acommercial airliner it claims it has already belatedly scrambled jets tointercept has hit the World Trade Center? It’s insane. We are told that at 8.52,two F-15 Eagles took off from Otis base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 185 milesfrom New York, to intercept the second hijacked plane from Boston: Flight 175.About ten minutes later, at 9.03, Flight 175 smashed into the south tower withthe F-15s still 70 miles away, so they tell us. One other point is that theWorld Trade Center is said by one of its first tenants to be a “No Fly Zone”. Ifthat is so, there has to be a system of air response very close to New York,otherwise the No Fly Zone would be unenforceable. What would be the point of it?Ken Smith, a tenant of the World Trade Center back in 1979, said on Radio FreeAmerica that when he was there it was well known by tenants that the WTC was aNo Fly Zone. Smith said that any plane off-course within 12 miles of the WTC wasgiven a warning to change direction and he added: “If you came within five milesthey would threaten to shoot you down. If you came within three miles, theycould shoot you down.” 37The Pentagon “No Fly Zone”This just gets crazier and crazier when you look at Flight 77. The officialtimeline says that the FAA notified NORAD at 9.24am (usually reported as 9.25)that United Airlines Flight 77 from Dulles Airport at Washington DC to LosAngeles may have been hijacked. Yet it was known before 9 o’clock that there wasa problem with the plane. As I’ve mentioned earlier, radar reports published byUSA Today suggest that Flight 77 took a massive detour off-course in a north towest to south loop over West Virginia before returning to course for a shorttime (Figure 15). This course is very different from the routes published by therest of the media and could, I guess, be a mistake. If it was, however, it was amassive one. USA Today source their route to Flight Explorer, a company thattracks commercial aircraft in real time on the Internet using data supplied bythe Federal Aviation Administration. I contacted Flight Explorer and asked forconfirmation, or otherwise, of the USA Today graphic.image [../Images/00017.jpg]Figure 15: The USA Today version of the route of Flight 77 image [../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 16: The other version of Flight 77 published elsewhere in the media They sent me a course that did not include such a blatant detour (Figure 16), sotake your pick. If the “USA Today” detour did happen, it would have been ataround 8.36 going by the Flight Explorer timeline. This was at least 16 minutesafter it was known that Flight 11 had been hijacked, but no action was takenabout Flight 77 deviating wildly from its course, if that is what occurred. Thiscontinued to be the case even after Flight 11 had smashed into the World TradeCenter and it was known that Flight 175 had also been hijacked and crashed intothe other tower. I asked the FAA what happened when, according to USA Today,Flight 77 looped off course before returning to the scheduled route because,obviously, I wanted to establish the truth about the course taken by the plane.Did it loop or did it not? If it did, what action had been taken at that time?What communications were made with the cockpit to establish what was going on?The FAA would not answer me, saying I had all the information it could give. TheNew York Times published what it claimed was a partial transcript of thecommunication tapes between Flight 77 and air traffic controllers. Air trafficcontrollers failed to make contact with Flight 77 from 8.56 according thetranscript and at 8.58 Jim McDonnell, a representative of American Airlines(AAL), is on the line. The airline also tries and fails to make contact with theplane. The following is an exchange on the transcript that is said to have takenplace from about 9.02; that’s 17 minutes after AA Flight 11 had crashed into theWorld Trade Center and little more than a minute before United Airlines 175would do the same: 9:02:07AAL: American Airlines dispatch Jim McDonnell [on the line].9:02:09Indianapolis Control, Henderson Sector Radar Associate: Yeah this isIndianapolis center, we, uh, I don’t know if I’m talking to the same guy aboutAmerican 77.9:02:13AAL: Yeah I cell called him but I did not get a reply back from him.9:02:17Indianapolis Control, Henderson Sector Radar Associate: We, uh, we lost trackcontrol of the guy he’s in coast track but we haven’t, we don’t where his targetis and we can’t get a hold of him um, you guys tried him and no response.9:02:26AAL: no response (background noise).9:02:28Indianapolis Control, Henderson Sector Radar Associate: Yeah we have no radarcontact and uh no communications with him so if you guys could try again.9:02:35AAL: We’re doing it.9:02:37Indianapolis Control, Henderson Sector Radar Associate: All right thanks a lot.9:02:38AAL: We’re doing it thank you.9:03:07Indianapolis Control, Henderson Sector Radar: American 77 Indy.

It is worth emphasising that during this exchange, if it is genuine,they acknowledged that two flights bound for Los Angeles had crashed into theWorld Trade Center and that contact with Flight 77, another Los Angeles-boundplane, had been lost for some 29 minutes by that point. But it would be anotherten minutes before NORAD was informed, according to the timeline agreed by bothNORAD and the FAA. Staggering. On air safety grounds alone there should havebeen an immediate response to Flight 77 because of the lethal dangers to otheraircraft of flying off-course. Then soon after the “USA Today loop” wascompleted, if that was the case, and it returned to its course the transpondersignal disappeared from the screens of air traffic control and yet still NORADwas not alerted according to the official story agreed by both NORAD and theFederal Aviation Administration. The plane then did a 180-degree turn near theOhio border and headed back towards Washington, but still no alert even with twohijacked planes buried in the World Trade Center and with controllers apparentlyunable to locate Flight 77 on their radar screens for ten minutes. Only at 9.24was NORAD told by the FAA that Flight 77 was in serious trouble, bothorganisations told me. As a New York Times report said: “By 9.25am the FAA, inconsultation with the Pentagon, had taken the radical step of banning alltake-offs around the country, but fighters still had not been dispatched.” 39This was some 40 minutes after Flight 77 dramatically changed course and Flight11 crashed into the World Trade Center; it was at least 35 minutes after airtraffic controllers knew that Flight 77 had been hijacked; 24 minutes after thetransponder signal was lost; 22 minutes after Flight 175 hit the World TradeCenter; and 18 minutes after air traffic control facilities throughout thecountry knew that Flight 77 had likely been hijacked. Yet look at the FAAregulations again for air traffic controllers: “Consider that an aircraftemergency exists … when: … There is unexpected loss of radar contact and radiocommunications with any … aircraft”40 and “If … you are in doubt that asituation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as thoughit were an emergency.”41 MSNBC reported the day after 9/11 on how seriously airtraffic controllers and their bosses at the FAA are supposed to take aircraftthat deviate from their agreed route:> “If a plane deviates by 15 degrees, or two miles from that course, the flight> controllers will hit the panic button. They’ll call the plane, saying> ‘American 11, you’re deviating from course.’ It’s considered a real emergency,> like a police car screeching down a highway at 100 miles an hour. When golfer> Payne Stewart’s incapacitated Learjet missed a turn at a fix, heading north> instead of west to Texas, F-16 interceptors were quickly dispatched.” 42It was at 8.50am that contact was lost with the cockpit of Flight 77. At thatmoment the flight would have been under the control of the Indianapolis AirRoute Traffic Control Center, one of 20 regional centres that track flightsbetween airports.43 At 9.02, still 40 minutes before impact with the Pentagon, acontroller is reported to have told American Airlines the latest news on Flight77: “We lost track control of the guy, he’s in coast track but we haven’t – wedon’t really know where his target is and we can’t get a hold of him.” 44 Yet itwas only at 9.24 that NORAD was told that Flight 77 “may” have been hijacked? Ohdo come on, this is the land of clouds and cuckoos. As a Newsday report pointedout: “The record suggests that teenagers on instant-message networks communicatefaster than some federal officials did during the crisis.” 45 Or as the New YorkTimes put it:> “… despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control> the nation’s airspace in defense of the country, and despite two other> jetliners’ having already hit the World Trade Center in New York, the fighter> planes that scrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive> until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.” 46But even beyond all this, there is a more fundamental question that needs to beanswered. Why, when two hijacked airliners had been crashed into the World TradeCenter weren’t fighter jets deployed immediately to guard the skies overWashington? Surely the first thing you would do after what happened in New Yorkis to instigate air defence for your other most likely targets – Washingtonbeing the most obvious.Air traffic controllers mystifiedThe Miami Herald talked to air traffic controllers who said they could notunderstand why there was no reaction to what was happening in the skies thatmorning.47 Why no reaction from the FAA and the military? “That’s a questionthat more and more people are going to ask,” one controller in Miami told theHerald. “What the hell went on here? Was anyone doing anything about it? Just asa national defense thing, how are they able to fly around and no one go afterthem?” 48 The Herald quoted controllers who said that even with the transpondersilent, the plane would have been visible on radar both to controllers whohandle cross-continent air traffic and to a Federal Aviation Administrationcommand centre outside of Washington. The FAA would not discuss with the MiamiHerald the track of Flight 77 or what happened in air-control centres while itwas in flight, and nor would American Airlines. Air traffic controllers told theHerald that the trouble should have been instantly noticeable. Flight 77, likeall such planes, would have first showed up on radar screens as a short solidline, the Herald reported, with a readout that identifies the plane and givesits altitude and speed. When the transponder shuts down, the short linevanishes. The speed number goes away too. “It’s just something that catches youreye”, one controller said.49 The first move when a transponder goes down wouldbe to contact the pilot and tell him the transponder wasn’t working. But even ifthe plane remained silent, controllers could still find it – by switching theirscreen display to the old-fashioned radar that bounces a signal off the plane’smetal skin, the Herald said. The report went on:> “Military jets are routinely scrambled in the case of hijackings and> “runners,” planes that do not answer or do not heed air traffic controllers.> But FAA officials would not say when controllers detected the errant Flight 77> or whether any fighter jets were able to get into the air to confront it.> Fighter jets are based nearby, in Virginia, and could have reached the White> House within minutes, aviation sources say …> “… The FAA has a detailed hijacking manual: Supervisors are notified. The FAA> command center near Washington and the FBI are put on alert. Military jets are> scrambled to follow the plane. Air-traffic controllers try to figure out where> the hijacker wants to go and, if necessary, clear an air space of other> traffic.” 50Big Dick reveals allVice President Dick Cheney told NBC’s Meet the Press 51 that from the time thatFlight 11 struck the World Trade Center the secret service travelling withPresident Bush in Florida had “open lines” with the Federal AviationAdministration. He said: “The secret service has an arrangement with the FAA.They had open lines after the World Trade Center was …” He didn’t finish thesentence, no doubt because he realised he had said too much, and it is worthpondering the wider implications of that statement. The FAA had open lines withthe secret service after the World Trade Center was hit? That happened at 8.46,about the time that Flight 77 was known to be in trouble, and yet the FAA saidthey did not tell NORAD and the Pentagon Command Center about Flight 77 until9.24 when they had already established open lines to the secret service. Are webeing told that the Pentagon and NORAD did not have open lines also with the FAAand were able to follow in real time the communications and non-communicationsfrom the cockpits long before a single fighter jet was deployed? Indeed the FAAand NORAD have both confirmed to me that they had open lines to discuss Flights77 and 93, the one that crashed in Pennsylvania. I asked the FAA when exactlythese open lines were established, but its spokesman would not say. Surely inany sane system these would have been established, as Cheney indicated, at leastfrom the moment the first plane struck the World Trade Center. So, again, whythe delay in responding?We are told that after contact was lost with Flight 77 and its transponder wasdeactivated, an “unidentified” aircraft was eventually picked up on radarheading for Washington at some 500 miles an hour and this turned out to beFlight 77. Unidentified? Have you seen the tracking technology available toNORAD and Cheyenne Mountain? Even when a transponder is turned off the plane canstill be tracked by conventional radar, let alone by the technology those guyshave. At around 9.27, NORAD says it ordered jets scrambled from Langley AirForce Base in Virginia (the base of the CIA’s own fleet of military aircraft) tointercept Flight 77. Before becoming head of NORAD, General Ralph Eberhart wasCommander, Air Combat Command, at Langley. At 9.35, it is said, three F-16Fighting Falcons took off from Langley for Washington. Note the approximatelyeight minutes’ response time before they were in the air in this official storywhen the Air Force apparently claims response times of scramble to 29,000 feetin two and a half minutes.52 An F-16 has a top speed of some 1,800 miles anhour, twice the speed of sound. At 9.37, Flight 77 was “lost from radarscreens”, the story goes, and a minute later hit the Pentagon, precisely 60years to the day since construction of that building began on September 11th1941, the year of Pearl Harbor. The NORAD jets arrived at 9.49, so we are told.Shucks, just missed again. What terrible bad luck. These jets flew at speeds ofabout “.9 mach” or just below the speed of sound, according to information givento me by NORAD spokesman Barry Venable, who, I must say, was extremely thoroughand efficient in his dealings with me.53 He said that .9 mach is between 603 and675 miles per hour depending on the altitude the planes were flying. The higherthey fly the faster they go. Of course, their top speed of 1,800 miles an houris not possible over land at lower altitudes, but less than the speed of soundfor aircraft capable of twice the speed of sound might legitimately bequestioned here when they were pursuing a hijacked airliner heading for the UScapital after two others had been crashed into the World Trade Center. BarryVenable quoted similar speeds for the planes NORAD says were scrambled from OtisAir Force Base, but an Otis spokesman quoted by the local Cape Cod Times saidthe 153 miles from there to New York can be made by an F-15 in as little as tenminutes – that’s around 918 miles per hour. At that speed the 130 miles fromLangley to Washington would be completed in around eight minutes. This speedwould have put jets from Langley over the Pentagon at about 9.38/39 – just asFlight 77 was turning in to crash and not “12 minutes [or] 105 miles” away asthe NORAD timelines says they were at the time of impact.A commercial airliner can fly from Washington to Ohio, turn back and fly all theway from the Midwest to cross a No Fly Zone and crash into the headquarters ofthe most powerful military force on earth without a military response worth thename? Vice President Dick Cheney even told the NBC Meet the Press programme54that: “It doesn’t do any good to put up a combat air patrol if you don’t givethem instructions to act, if, in fact, they feel it’s appropriate.” He says thisto divert attention from the fact that this is precisely what is happening everyweek in the skies of North America. You can check out and intercept (“stop,deflect, or interrupt the progress or intended course of”)55 an aircraft withoutshooting it down, for goodness sake. Again this was Cheney’s attempt to misleadpeople from the central questions that will unleash the genie.Why not Andrews?Langley is around 130 miles from Washington so why did NORAD say it scrambledjets from that far away when Andrews Air Force Base, the one designated todefend Washington DC, is only a little over ten miles from the capital andpilots from there could have had breakfast and still intercepted Flight 77 withtime to spare? This is even allowing for the fact that NORAD only activatedinterception procedures some 34 minutes after contact with the plane was lost.Andrews Air Force Base is a minute or so by fighter jet from Washington DC andthat’s why it is the capital’s first line of air defence (see map, Figure 17overleaf). In the name of sanity, the airspace above the Pentagon and the WhiteHouse is a No Fly Zone and of course there are going to be squadrons on standbyat the nearest Air Force base to defend that. Andrews is one of the most famousbases in America because it is the home of Air Force One, the President’s plane,and foreign heads of state often pass through there. Again, are you going tolocate the presidential plane at a base that does not have fighters that areready to move at a moment’s notice? Andrews, in fact, has two major squadrons onwhat are officially termed the highest possible state of readiness. These arethe 121st Fighter Squadron of the 113th Fighter Wing and the 321st MarineFighter Attack Squadron of the 49th Marine Air Group. Thousands of people areemployed at the base and they have at their disposal the very F-16s that NORADsays it deployed from 130 miles away at Langley, plus F/A-18 fighters. Thesidewinder missiles carried by F-16s have a range of 18 miles and they wouldonly have to get off the ground, lock in and fire to stop a plane crashing intothe Pentagon. The fact that these planes were not scrambled from Andrews at anytime before impact with the Pentagon is stunning. The Andrews AFB website wentdown immediately after September 11th and did not reappear until aroundmid-November.56 When it came back online it no longer had a link to the AirForce web pages describing the capabilities and mission of 113th Fighter Wing ofthe Air National Guard at Andrews – the capability of reacting immediately toany threat by air to Washington.57image [../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 17: This is how close the Andrews Air Force Base is to The Pentagon. Sowhy no reaction until after the building was hit? A website called dcmiltary.com [http://www.dcmiltary.com] is authorised tosupply information to those employed by US forces. It reported before 9/11(although I haven’t been able to find the web page since) that Andrews is thebase for the 121st Fighter Squadron, 113th Fighter Wing, and it confirmed itsrole: “… as part of its dual mission, the 113th provides capable and readyresponse forces for the District of Columbia in the event of a natural disasteror civil emergency. Members also assist local and federal law enforcementagencies in combating drug trafficking in the District of Colombia. [They] arefull partners with the active Air Force.” 58 Of the 321st Marine Fighter AttackSquadron of the 49th Marine Air Group at Andrews, it says: “In the besttradition of the Marine Corps, a ‘few good men and women’ support twocombat-ready reserve units at Andrews AFB. Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA)321, a Marine Corps Reserve squadron, flies the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet.Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 49, Detachment A, provides maintenance andsupply functions necessary to maintain a force in readiness.” 59 These units areoperated by the District of Colombia National Guard, headquartered at Andrews,and its official website has this to say about its capabilities:> “The DC Air National Guard is located on Andrews Air Force Base, in Camp> Springs, Maryland. We are home to the 113th Wing: the 121 Fighter Squadron> (including the F-16 Fighting Falcons) and the 201 Air Lift Squadron; the 121> Weather Squadron; and the 231 Combat Communications Squadron.> “The DC Air National Guard has called Andrews AFB home since the unit’s> post-war reorganization in 1946. We draw our members from throughout the> District of Columbia metropolitan area, as well as from more distant points in> Maryland, Virginia, and neighboring states.> “The unit has about 1,400 people, most of whom spend one weekend each month at> Andrews for scheduled training. A smaller, full-time contingent maintains the> day-to-day operations as a framework that supports the full-time flying> training mission.> “We presently fly the F16-C and F16-D Fighting Falcon jet fighters, after> conversion from the F4-D in January 1990. The F16 is the ninth different type> of fighter in the wing’s 44-year history.”And look at how it completes this piece of self-congratulation:> “Throughout its existence, the men and women of the DC Air National Guard have> been and will continue to be a vital part of the community and the total> force. They stand ready to respond to the needs of the District of Columbia –> and the nation – should the need arise.” [Except on September 11th]60The DC Air National Guard even calls itself the “Capital Guardians”! Before9/11, although not it seems afterwards, they made their mission crystal clearwhen they claimed to …“provide combat units in the highest possible state ofreadiness”. So where on earth were they on September 11th when a commercialairliner flew back towards Washington, for 45 minutes after Air Traffic Controllost contact, to crash a minute’s flying time from Andrews AFB? It was not thefault of the pilots who, I’m sure, are utterly bewildered at what happened. Itis the highest level of the military and government that we have to focus on –those with the power to decide not to deploy from Andrews. NORAD spokesman BarryVenable told me that NORAD fighters were “not standing alert, nor evenstationed, at Andrews AFB on 11 September. The USAF did indeed have fightersstationed at Andrews AFB on 11 September, but not for the purpose of standingair sovereignty alert – a role NORAD performs.”61 Then how come fighters fromAndrews were in the sky over Washington immediately after the Pentagon was hit?USA Today, America’s national newspaper, also sought to explain away the“Andrews mystery” by reporting that “Andrews Air Force Base, home to Air ForceOne, is only 15 miles [sic] away from the Pentagon, but it had no fightersassigned to it. Defense officials won’t say whether that has changed.” 62 Noteven NORAD claims there were no fighters at Andrews, and what kind of journalismis it that prints this story when the truth is only a “Netfind” away? The sameUSA Today edition also said in direct contradiction: “The District of ColumbiaNational Guard maintained fighter planes at Andrews Air Force Base, only about15 miles [sic] from the Pentagon, but those planes were not on alert and notdeployed.” 63 The San Diego Union-Tribune, however, told the truth about Andrewswhen it reported:> “Air defense around Washington is provided mainly by fighter planes from> Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland near the District of Columbia border. The> DC Air National Guard is also based there and equipped with F-16 fighter> planes, a National Guard spokesman said. But the fighters took to the skies> over Washington only after the devastating attack on the Pentagon …” 64Other media sources also reported that fighters from Andrews AFB were deployedover Washington. NBC Nightly News said: “It was after the attack on the Pentagonthat the Air Force then decided to scramble F-16s out of the DC National GuardAndrews Air Force Base to fly a protective cover over Washington, DC.” 65 The UKDaily Telegraph said: “Within minutes of the attack [on the Pentagon] Americanforces around the world were put on one of their highest states of alert –Defcon 3, just two notches short of all-out war – and F-16s from Andrews AirForce Base were in the air over Washington DC.” 66 A “former Pentagon AirTraffic Controller” quoted, but not named, is said to have commented:> “All those years ago when I was in the Pentagon, this wouldn’t have happened.> Air Traffic Control Radar images were (and are) available in the> understructures of the Pentagon, and any commercial flight within 300 miles of> DC that made an abrupt course change toward Washington, turned off their> transponder, and refused to communicate with ATC, would have been intercepted> at supersonic speeds within a max of 9 minutes by a fighter out of Andrews.> Period. Why these planes weren’t, baffles me. If we could get fighters off the> ground in two minutes then, we could now.” 67And yet a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, made this astonishingstatement: “Planes come up and down the Potomac all the time. You can hear themin the building. There was no warning.” 68 John A. Koskinen, the Washington DCCity Administrator, said the District was “largely helpless” to stop suchattacks.69 Utter garbage.What happened to flight 93?United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco was, we aretold, reported to NORAD as a possible hijack at 9.16am. This was about around 16minutes after the aircraft is thought to have been taken over. At 9.35am Flight93 filed a new flight plan and headed for Washington. I asked the FAA who in thecockpit filed that plan and what exchange took place between air trafficcontrol, but the spokesman said he could give me no information on this. At9.40, it is claimed, the transponder signal stopped and “radar contact waslost”. This is nonsense. We are talking NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain here and,like the FAA system, they can still track a plane after the transponder has beenswitched off. At approximately 10.03 according to the NORAD timeline (anythingup to 10.37 according to others), Flight 93 “crashed” near Shanksville,Pennsylvania, and the NORAD timeline says that no fighter jet was within 100miles of the plane when it went down. By 10.03, if we take the NORAD version, itwas an hour and 11 minutes since fighters are said to have been scrambled fromOtis AFB to New York and 50 minutes since Flight 93 was reported to NORAD as apossible hijack. My own feeling is that at least one jet did get to Flight 93 onthis occasion and may well have shot down the aircraft. I will elaborate on thebackground later.What a shamblesThe FAA-NORAD-Pentagon response procedure in these circumstances could not beclearer in the official regulations. Equally clear is that on September 11th, onthat day of all days, that response was a disgrace. I do not believe for asecond that this is unconnected to the fact that the Illuminati, working throughUS government agencies, wanted the attacks of September 11th to happen as theydid. Somewhere in that normal line of response from the FAA’s air trafficcontrol through to the Pentagon and the scrambling of NORAD jets a spanner wasthrown in the works to slow down the reaction times. If you accept that the FAAand NORAD timelines are correct, the FAA is an organisation that has someserious questions to answer, but won’t. I asked the FAA media spokesman FraserJones the following questions:> 1.I have been going through the timeline you sent to me and I have some> questions. I asked when there was first known to be a problem with the four> flights and in answer to that you gave me the times that the FAA informed> NORAD. These are not the same times as when a problem was first identified.> Could I have the times when problems were first identified?> 2.Flight 11 failed to respond to the air traffic controller at 8.13 and yet> both the FAA and NORAD say that the FAA did not inform NORAD of a problem> until 8.40. Why a delay of 27 minutes?> 3.Flight 77 failed to respond to air traffic control at 8.50am and six minutes> later the transponder was turned off … yet both NORAD and the FAA say that the> FAA did not inform NORAD of a problem until 9.24.

Forquestion six he said: “The FAA monitors prohibited airspace and would be awareif a pilot blundered into such an area. Our mission is not civil defense. Wewould help coordinate the appropriate response given the circumstances”.70 Whaton earth does that mean? NORAD told me that it is not responsible for policingthe No Fly Zone over Washington and it was a matter for the civilian FAA. TheFAA tells me it “monitors prohibited airspace” and would be aware if a pilotblundered into such an area and would then help to coordinate the appropriateresponse in the circumstances. Oh really well take your time, no rush. How longdoes it take for a plane to enter restricted airspace over Washington before itparks itself in the White House, Capitol Hill, or the Pentagon? Seconds. Sowhere would the immediate air or ground-to-air response come from? Langley AFB130 miles away? What the hell use would that be? Now the FAA and NORAD areeither not telling me the truth or there is no system for protecting No FlyZones. One or the other must be the case given what they have both said. I askedFraser Jones whom the FAA would contact when the No Fly Zone threatened to bebreached and they “coordinate the appropriate response in the circumstances”,but I received no reply. Couldn’t be Andrews AFB and the DC Air National Guardcould it?Military special operations commander was head of FAA “security”The head of security for the FAA on September 11th was Michael Canavan, whoresigned after only 10 months in the job shortly after the attacks. Canavan is aretired US Army lieutenant general, who had been Chief of Staff of the USEuropean Command in Stuttgart, Germany. Canavan has a considerable background inUS Special Operations, which, according to the Department of Defense’sDictionary of Military and Associated Terms, are defined as: “Operationsconducted by specially organized, trained, and equipped military andparamilitary forces to achieve military, political, economic or psychologicalobjectives by unconventional means in hostile, denied or politically sensitiveareas.” In short: operations that are above the law and off the record. Canavanwas Commanding General, Special Operations Command, Europe, and CommandingGeneral, Joint Special Operations Command, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. InJuly 2002, the military announced that four soldiers with Special Forces basedat Fort Bragg had murdered their wives and three of the men had recentlyreturned from Afghanistan. Two had also killed themselves and the other two hadbeen charged with murder. The military said the murders were “not stressrelated”. This is the same Fort Bragg that provided several officers from its USArmy 4th Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Group to work in the news division atCNN’s headquarters in Atlanta in the final days of the Kosovo War, according tomedia reports, and also staffed the National Security Council’s Office of PublicDiplomacy (OPD), a shadowy government propaganda agency that planted stories inthe US media supporting the Reagan-Bush Administration’s policies in CentralAmerica. The Miami Herald of July 19th 1987 quoted a “senior US official” asdescribing the OPD as a “vast psychological warfare operation of the kind themilitary conducts to influence a population in enemy territory.” These are thesorts of operations that Michael Canavan, the head of FAA security on September11th, would have been involved with in his high positions in Special OperationsCommand.What is absolutely clear is that the FAA’s response to the hijackings thatmorning was bizarre, and this happened in what must be the best-defendedairspace in the world. Let us consider again the capabilities detailed in theofficial websites of the FAA’s partners in policing US airspace, NORAD andCheyenne Mountain:> •The NORAD Command Center at Cheyenne Mountain is responsible for “monitoring,> processing, and interpreting missile, space or air events which could have> operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could be potential> threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas.” So why not on> September 11th?> •Cheyenne Mountain serves as a central collection and coordination facility> for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide … the leadership of> Canada and the US with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat.” So why> not on September 11th?> •The Command Centre is linked directly to the National Command Authorities of> both the US and Canada as well as to regional command centres overseas. When> required, the Command Director must consult directly with the NORAD and US> Space Command Commander in Chief for time-critical assessments of missile,> air, and space events; he takes action to ensure the Commander in Chief’s> response and direction are properly conveyed and executed … So why not on> September 11th?> •“… The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the air> surveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they> monitored over 700 ‘unknown’ radar tracks entering North American airspace.> Many of these were subsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred> from flight plans or used improper procedures.” So where was the monitoring on> September 11th?> •There is also a Systems Center that “ensures continuity of operations> throughout the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center by providing communications> and computer systems management for over 100 computer systems and 600> communications circuits in support of NORAD and US Space Command missile> warning, space control, and air defence missions. So why not on September> 11th?> •Cheyenne Mountain is responsible for “… the monitoring of man-made objects in> space, and the detection, validation, and warning of attack against North> America whether by aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles, utilizing mutual> support arrangements with other commands. Aerospace control includes ensuring> air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace of Canada and the United> States.” So why not on September 11th?The standing rule of NORAD officals is to apparently give unknown airplanesapproaching US airspace two minutes to identify themselves. If this does nothappen fighter-intercepts are scrambled in two minutes without exception. Thehead of the Russian Air Force, Anatoli Kornukov, said: “As soon as somethinglike that [the hijackings] happens here, I am reported about that right away andin a minute we are all up.” 71 The response to what happened on September 11thwas a total shambles, but what was it that Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty said?“No one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is playedsecretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who hasthe power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions?” He could nothave put it better in relation to 9/11. The FAA and NORAD are not the only oneswho have some serious questions to answer. So do President Bush, theCommander-in-Chief of US forces; Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense; andAir Force General Richard B. Myers, the then Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefsof Staff. What a trio this is …> Postscript:> By 2004, researchers had established that a series of ‘exercises’ involving> NORAD, the US Air Force, and other agencies were going on at the same time as> the 9/11 attacks. This caused (as planned) great confusion because the> personnel involved did not know if the attacks were real or part of the> exercise.

Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public mind.General William Westmoreland, Commander US forces in VietnamTwo weeks after the attacks on America, General Richard B. Myers officially tookover as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Before his appointment to thePentagon as Deputy Chairman in 2000, he was the Commander of NORAD. Myers,therefore, knew precisely what the procedures were for reacting to unexplainedhappenings with planes in North American airspace.As we have seen, Federal Aviation Administration regulations say: “The escortservice will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact withthe National Military Command Center (NMCC)”. The NMCC is based at the Pentagon,headquarters of the Joint Chiefs, and the Department of Defense’s own manualsays that: “In the event of a hijacking, the National Military Command Centerwill be notified by the most expeditious means by the Federal AviationAdministration. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses …forward requests for DOD [Department of Defense] assistance to the Secretary ofDefense for approval.” This is the same National Military Command Center thatclaims it had no warning that an airliner was about to crash into its ownbuilding some 45 minutes after it deviated off course! Where was General Myerswhile all this was going on and what were the top brass in the Pentagon doingall this time? What was Defense Secretary Rumsfeld doing? Where was PresidentBush? Myers knew the response procedures. He knew that Andrews AFB around tenmiles down the road had all that was necessary to respond to Flight 77 as itheaded for Washington. Yet nothing was done. The New York Times tried to explainwhat was happening at the Pentagon that morning:> “During the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control> of hijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon,> military officials in a command center on the east side of the building were> urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about> what to do.”(No, you didn’t misread that.)> “But despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to> control the nation’s airspace in defense of the country, and despite two other> jetliners’ having already hit the World Trade Center in New York, the fighter> planes that scrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive> until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.” 1What? Military chiefs in the Pentagon command centre were “urgently talkingabout what to do?” Uh? These are the guys who are supposed to protect the UnitedStates from nuclear attack! “Er, now there’s a missile heading for us gentlementhat will end life in America as we know it. This is due to land on thisbuilding in two minutes, now what do you think we should do?” If they weretalking to air traffic officials (FAA) during the hour in question why noresponse from NORAD? Why are we told that NORAD, which is under Pentagoncommand, was not alerted about Flight 77 until 9.24 when the Pentagon commandcentre was “urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic controlofficials about what to do” for “the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77was under the control of the hijackers”? Given what had happened in New York whyweren’t planes scrambled to patrol the skies over Washington as a matter ofcourse anyway? General Myers told his Senate confirmation hearing when he becameChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he pledged “…to keep our armed forcesat that razor’s edge”! A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel VicWarzinski, even had the audacity to tell Newsday that: “The Pentagon was simplynot aware that this aircraft was coming our way …” 2 The Cheyenne Mountainofficial website says of the NORAD Command Center: “Redundant and survivablecommunications hot lines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon, WhiteHouse, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa, otheraerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers around theworld.” 3 And the Pentagon didn’t know that a hijacked plane heading for its owncity for more than 45 minutes was coming its way?? CNN reported that while PayneStewart’s plane was flying on auto pilot “… officers on [sic] the Joint Chiefswere monitoring the Learjet on radar screens inside the Pentagon’s NationalMilitary Command Center”.4 Of course they were, that’s what they are supposed todo. Why are we told they did not do this on September 11th when four planes werehijacked, and that they didn’t know one was heading in their direction? It is aninsult to the intelligence. CNN also quoted officials at the Pentagon as sayingthey were never made aware of the threat from hijacked United Airlines Flight 93until after it crashed in Pennsylvania.5 Reports say that the Federal AviationAdministration informed NORAD at 9.16am that Flight 93 may have been hijackedand the transponder was turned off at 9.40, although NORAD and the FAA both toldme that open lines between them were established to discuss Flight 93. There isno way that the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center with open lines tothe FAA and NORAD was not told of the hijack of Flight 93 until it crashed after10am. The Pentagon’s entire story is nonsense, of course it is, and it isdesigned to hide the simple truth – at the highest levels of power within the USgovernment and military these attacks were being allowed to happen.Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon on the west side of what is the biggestoffice complex in the world. This is the opposite side of the building to wherethe main offices of Donald Rumsfeld and the military top brass and the NationalMilitary Command Center are located. The targeted section had been the first offive to undergo renovations and strengthening to protect the Pentagon fromterrorist attacks. Yet this is the very section these “highly trained, highlyprofessional” terrorists aimed for?? Such is the size and strength of thePentagon that Rumsfeld said that he only felt a “jarring thing” when the planehit.6 If you were really a crazed Islamic fanatic dedicated to attacking the“Great Satan America”, why would you aim the plane at the very opposite side ofa 29-acre, six million-square-foot building to where your real targets are? Thesame reason why Timothy McVeigh parked the Ryder truck as far away as possiblefrom his alleged target, the offices of the ATF, I guess.Where was Myers?General Myers was Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on September 11thin the absence abroad of the outgoing General Hugh Shelton. Myers would beconfirmed as Shelton’s successor at a Senate hearing only two days later.Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the highest-ranking uniformed military post andthird in command of US forces with only the president and the defense secretaryabove him in the line of command. Surely this is a man who would have been atthe centre of events with America “under attack” from terrorists. Where wasMyers while all hell was breaking loose in those two horrific hours? It turnsout, and I’m not kidding, that he was having a meeting with Senator Max Clelandof Georgia on Capitol Hill. I think its best if you sit down while you read thefollowing, and breathing deeply might help too. This is Myers’ account of hismovements that morning described in an interview with the Armed Forces Radio andTelevision Service:> “I remember it was like watching a bad movie. I was on Capitol Hill. I was> about ready to meet with Senator Cleland. I was meeting with him in> preparation for my hearing, my confirmation hearing to be the Chairman of the> Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I remember before we walked in there was a TV that> was playing and somebody has said, ‘An airplane has hit one of the World Trade> Center towers’. They thought it was an airplane, and they thought it was a> small airplane or something like that. So we walked in and we did the office> call with Senator Cleland.”The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the US military on American soil thatday hears that a plane has hit the World Trade Center and instead of checking itout he goes into a routine meeting with a senator about confirmation hearings?Come again? And it gets worse:> “Sometime during that office call the second tower was hit. Nobody informed us> of that. But when we came out, that was obvious. Then right at that time> somebody said the Pentagon has been hit.” 7Hold on, let me sit down here and strap in. No one informs the Acting Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military man on American soil that day,that a second airliner has hit the World Trade Center when, down in Florida, theWhite House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, is telling President Bush that “Americais under attack”, according to the official story? General Myers’ account makesno rational sense whatsoever. Do they really think we are all so stupid that wewould believe that the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is notcontactable at all times and that he would not have been told of the secondplane – indeed the first also – as a matter of course by the Pentagon? If hewasn’t, why the hell not? Myers then says that “right at the time” when he andCleland came out of their meeting “somebody said the Pentagon has been hit”. Wecan therefore add a timeline to his story. Myers’ account puts him in themeeting with Cleland at no later than around 9am before the second plane crashedand he did not come out until the Pentagon was struck, that’s no earlier than9.38 – 9.40. How amazing that this meeting took place across precisely the timethat the attacks were happening. The New York Times tells us that “during thehour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of hijackers,up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officials ina command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to lawenforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do.” 8 All this washappening and they didn’t inform their ultimate boss that day who was in ameeting down the street on Capitol Hill? Smell a rat? I smell a whole species.General Myers says that when he emerged from the meeting to be told what most ofthe world already knew, he launched into action:> “Immediately, somebody handed me a cell phone, and it was General Eberhart out> at NORAD in Colorado Springs talking about what was happening and the actions> he was going to take. We immediately, after talking to him, jumped in the car,> ran back to the Pentagon.” [How do you do both?] 9I have detailed the fantastic technology and communications network at thedisposal of NORAD and the Pentagon, and yet NORAD contacts the acting militaryhead of US forces only after three planes have crashed over nearly an hour andwhen somebody handed him a cell phone? The NORAD commander General Eberhart –the man who replaced Myers at Cheyenne Mountain – is telling him “the actions heis going to take” after three airliners are embedded in three of America’sbiggest buildings and 3,000 people are dead? What in God’s name had Eberhart andhis NORAD operation been doing all this time? If you feel you can stand anymore, General Myers also told Armed Forces Radio and Television:> “The Chairman [General Shelton] had left that morning to go to Europe, so he> was somewhere over the Atlantic. As I got to the Pentagon I noticed a lot of> people were coming out of the Pentagon. Of course they’d been told to> evacuate. My concern was where can you best discharge your duties? … [My]> battle station was in the National Military Command Center. I asked if it was> still running, they said it sure is, so I went back in the building to the> Command Center and was joined shortly thereafter by the Secretary of Defense.> The Deputy Secretary actually went to another location at that point. We did> what had to be done in terms of the command and control of the day …”The interviewer asked Myers if he could believe that it was actually a terroristattack:> “I didn’t know what to believe at the time. That was the problem. We had these> events, and then subsequently the airplane went down in Pennsylvania. We were> trying to tie this together, what does this mean? General Eberhart was working> with the Federal Aviation Agency trying to figure out the logical steps at> this point. We had some fighters airborne at that time in case we had some> hijacked airplanes that were possibly a threat to other institutions or> structures, but it was initially pretty confusing. You hate to admit it, but> we hadn’t thought about this.”Given what is claimed to have happened, the voices said to have been heard fromthe cockpit radios, and reports by passengers and attendants on cellphones andairphones that morning, to say they didn’t know this was a “terrorist attack” isan unbelievable misrepresentation of events. Only with three planes down,thousands dead, and a fourth soon to crash in Pennsylvania, did the top militaryofficer on duty that day walk into the command centre at the Pentagon which, aswe have seen, has clear and set procedures for reacting to hijackings oraircraft anomalies and would have had open lines to the Federal AviationAdministration and NORAD throughout. Only then did the Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld appear and he was in the building from about the time that Flight 11,the first hijacked plane, was leaving its gate at Boston Logan. More aboutRumsfeld shortly, but let us stay with General Myers because this guy really issomething else. You may have seen him: a grey-haired chap in uniform giving newsconferences at the Pentagon while his forces bombed innocent civilians inAfghanistan and elsewhere. Two days after 9/11 Myers appeared before the SenateArmed Services Committee hearing that confirmed his appointment as Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin questioned himabout what had happened while the attacks were taking place:> Levin: Was the Defense Department contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any other> agency after the first two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade> Center, prior to the time that the Pentagon was hit?> Myers: Sir, I don’t know the answer to that question. I can get that for you,> for the record.> Levin: Thank you. Did the Defense Department take – or was the Defense> Department asked to take action against any specific aircraft?> Myers: Sir, we were …> Levin: … And did you take action against – for instance, there have been> statements that the aircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania was shot down. Those> stories continue to exist.> Myers: Mr Chairman, the armed forces did not shoot down any aircraft. When it> became clear what the threat was, we did scramble fighter aircraft, AWACS,> radar aircraft and tanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other> aircraft showed up in the FAA system that were hijacked. But we never actually> had to use force.> Levin: Was that order that you just described given before or after the> Pentagon was struck? Do you know?> Myers: That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pentagon was> struck.10Well, well, well. The highest-ranking military man in America, third only inmilitary authority to the President and the Defense Secretary, and himself aformer Commander of NORAD, does not know two days after 9/11 if his own DefenseDepartment was contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any other agency after thefirst two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center and before thePentagon was hit? You mean he didn’t ask at any time after he claims to haverushed to his “battle station”, the National Military Command Center in thePentagon, where they would have known everything that had happened? What uttertripe. He knew exactly the procedure and lines of communications as both theActing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former head of NORAD. He knewthat the Defense Department, NORAD, and the FAA work closely in hijacksituations and that the Pentagon would have been notified before the first planecrashed, never mind after the first two had done so. He knew that fighters aredeployed as a matter of course to seek out rogue aircraft. General Myers you area liar and the question that follows is why are you lying? Myers says that “tohis knowledge” no order was given to scramble jets in response to the attacksuntil after the Pentagon was hit. “To his knowledge”? You mean he didn’t askthat question either when he “ran” to the Pentagon or for two days afterwards?In that time no one told him? This question of whether jets were indeedscrambled before the Pentagon was struck is interesting because not only didMyers say that to his knowledge this was the case, this appeared to be NORAD’sposition for several days also, although NORAD spokesman Barry Venable says thisis not the case and sent me an Associated Press report of September 11th inwhich NORAD spokesman Colonel Mike Perini is quoted as saying “NORAD controllersdid track one of the hijacked planes, but it crashed into the World Trade Centereven as fighters were scrambling.” However, other NORAD spokesmen said the veryopposite, as did General Myers. Two Cape Cod pilots, named only as Duff andNasty, spoke to the BBC programme Clear The Skies, which slavishly andunquestioningly repeated the official story from start to finish. The pilotssaid they did scramble to New York, but could not get there in time.Cue DanThe “we did scramble planes” story only began to circulate after a report by DanRather, the Council on Foreign Relations member and CBS News “anchor”. Rather isthe man who told talk show host David Letterman: “George Bush is the President.He makes the decisions. Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me where.” 11It was Rather who announced to the nation on September 14th that jets had beenscrambled while quoting no sources. From this “Rather exclusive” the “wescrambled jets, but they were just too late” story became the official history.In fact on September 12th, Rather himself had asked the CBS Military Consultant,Colonel Mitch Mitchell, why the Pentagon didn’t have a system in which fighterswere used to defend against attacks like 9/11.12 Rather’s revelations that jetswere deployed on September 11th before the Pentagon was hit came the day afterthe disastrous testimony of General Myers to the Senate Armed Forces Committeein which he had made the shocking statement that no fighters had been ordered tointercept the first three hijacked airliners over a period of nearly an hour anda half. Myers made no mention of planes scrambling from Otis or Langley, the CIAAir Force base where he was stationed for three years in the late 1980s. Then,hey presto, the following day the scrambled fighter jets story suddenly appearedon CBS. Dan Rather said that night:> “CBS News has learned the FAA alerted US Air Defense units of a possible> hijacking at 8.38 Tuesday morning, and six minutes later, at 8.44, two F-15s> received a scramble order at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. But two minutes> later, at 8.46, American Airlines Flight 11, the first hijacked jet, slammed> into the World Trade Center. Six minutes later, at 8.52, the F-15s were> airborne and began racing towards New York City, but the fighters were still> 70 miles away when the second hijacked jet, United Airlines Flight 175, hit> the second Trade Center tower. Shortly after that blast, the F-15s reached> Manhattan and began flying air cover missions over the city.> “But to the south, a new danger and a new response. At 9.30, three F-16s were> launched out of Langley Air Force base in Virginia, 150 miles [130] south of> Washington. But just seven minutes later, at 9.37, American Airlines Flight 77> hit the Pentagon. The F-16s arrived in Washington just before 10am and began> flying cover over the nation’s capital.” 13The contradictions can be clearly observed in two reports in the Boston Globejust four days apart. On Saturday, September 15th, reporter Glen Johnsonhighlighted the opposing accounts of CBS and NORAD.14 After repeating Rather’sCBS “exclusive” the night before, he writes that NORAD at this stage stilldenied scrambling any jets before the Pentagon was attacked, even though a NORADspokesman, Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, said they “routinely” interceptaircraft. Go figure. The Globe quoted Snyder as saying: “We scramble aircraft torespond to any aircraft that we consider a potential threat. The hijackedaircraft were normal, scheduled commercial aircraft on approved flight plans andwe only had 10 minutes prior notice to the first attack, which unfortunately wasnot enough notice.” 15 But he also confirmed that none were scrambled for thenext hour either! The Globe story says:> “ … Snyder, the NORAD spokesman … said the command did not immediately> scramble any fighters even though it was alerted to a hijacking 10 minutes> before the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los> Angeles, slammed into the first World Trade Center tower at 8.45am Tuesday.> ”Never before had a hijacked airliner been steered into a skyscraper, Snyder> noted, in trying to explain the lack of immediate response.> ”The spokesman said the fighters remained on the ground until after the> Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77 at 9.40am, during which time> the second trade center tower was struck by United Airlines Flight 175, which> also originated in Boston and was destined for Los Angeles.> ”By that time, military authorities realized the scope of the attack, Snyder> said, and finally ordered the jets aloft.” 16Vice President Cheney was still telling this same story on September 16th on theNBC show Meet the Press when he said it was Bush who personally made thedecision to send up interceptors and he suggested this was only done after thePentagon was hit.17 How does that square with having fighters in the air headingfor hijacked airliners before that time?18 But then suddenly the story changed,new song sheets all round at Cheyenne Mountain and the Pentagon. By September19th, eight days after 9/11, Glen Johnson and the Boston Globe were nowreporting a very different version of events from NORAD. Johnson wrote that:> ”Two fighter jets dispatched from Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod had> closed to within 71 miles of New York last week when the second of two> hijacked airliners slammed into the World Trade Center towers, the military> confirmed Tuesday.> “Similarly, two F-16 fighters that had scrambled from Langley Air Force Base> in Virginia streaked toward Washington as a third airliner bore in on the> Pentagon, but both were still about 12 minutes away when the commandeered> plane struck the nation’s military headquarters.” 19This timeline, provided by NORAD, had miraculously changed. As Johnson rightlypointed out: “The account contradicted earlier statements from a defense commandspokesman and the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [GeneralMyers]. Both said the military did not launch its planes until after thePentagon had been hit.” Now a “different defense command spokesman”, Army MajorBarry Venable, said the previous statements were based on “inaccurateinformation”.20 I met Glen Johnson in Boston and he told me he had called thepublic affairs office at Otis Air Force Base to ask them to confirm that theydid scramble planes that morning, but they refused to comment for reasons of“operational security” even though their bosses at NORAD had now issued a pressrelease saying that they had. Johnson told me that eventually they would notreturn his calls. What goes on? I asked NORAD if I could speak with the pilotsof the planes that were said to have been scrambled from Otis, but I was toldthey had “elected not to speak with the media”.21 They had no problem, however,speaking with the BBC programme Clear The Skies that unquestioningly repeatedthe official line and enjoyed great cooperation and access to Cheyenne Mountainand other military establishments as a result. I am not saying that the Otis andLangley jets were not scrambled, albeit way too late, but the blatantcontradictions in the official story are constant and obvious.Anyway, even according to this new timeline of NORAD and the Pentagon, nofighter jet got within 100 miles of even the fourth aircraft, Flight 93, beforeit crashed in Pennsylvania. Johnson highlights the obvious point that these“scrambled” jets flew to their targets at well below their potential speed. Why?We had the same contradictions with Flight 93 almost two hours after the problemwas first identified with Flight 11. Major General Paul Weaver, director of theAir National Guard, said that “No Air National Guard or other military planeswere scrambled to chase the fourth hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight93.” 22 This is a staggering statement in itself. But Rumsfeld’s Deputy DefenseSecretary Paul Wolfowitz was quoted in the Boston Herald telling a verydifferent story. He said that “… the Air Force was tracking the hijacked planethat crashed in Pennsylvania on Tuesday after other airliners slammed into thePentagon and World Trade Center and had been in a position to bring it down ifnecessary”.23 The whole official story is a mess. During his “evidence” to theSenate Committee on September 13th, General Myers was questioned by Senator BillNelson, who clearly exposed how ridiculous the earlier explanations had been:> Nelson: The second World Trade tower was hit shortly after 9am. And the> Pentagon was hit approximately 40 minutes later. That’s approximately. You> would know specifically what the timeline was. The crash that occurred in> Pennsylvania after the Newark westbound flight was turned around 180 degrees> and started heading back to Washington was approximately an hour after the> World Trade Center second explosion. You said earlier in your testimony that> we had not scrambled any military aircraft until after the Pentagon was hit.> And so, my question would be: why?> Myers: I think I had that right, that it was not until then. I’d have to go> back and review the exact timelines. [He thinks that’s right?]> Nelson: Perhaps we want to do this in our session, in executive [secret]> session. But my question is an obvious one for not only this committee, but> for the executive branch and the military establishment. If we knew that there> was a general threat on terrorist activity, which we did, and we suddenly have> two trade towers in New York being obviously hit by terrorist activity, of> commercial airliners taken off course from Boston to Los Angeles, then what> happened to the response of the defense establishment once we saw the> diversion of the aircraft headed west from Dulles turning around 180 degrees> and, likewise, in the aircraft taking off from Newark and, in flight, turning> 180 degrees? That’s the question. I leave it to you as to how you would like> to answer it. But we would like an answer.> Myers: You bet. I spoke, after the second tower was hit, I spoke to the> commander of NORAD, General Eberhart. And at that point, I think [think?] the> decision was at that point to start launching aircraft.> [Pardon? In his interview with Armed Forces Radio and Television he said that> when he came out of his meeting on Capitol Hill with Senator Max Cleland he> was told of the second plane crashing into the WTC and that the Pentagon had> just been hit. Only then, he said, did he talk to Eberhart. Myers is changing> his accounts in response to Nelson’s questions as they expose the inexplicable> non-reaction of NORAD and the Pentagon. What Myers is therefore saying here> again is that no planes were scrambled until after the Pentagon was hit.]> Myers: One of the things you have to understand, senator, is that in our> posture right now, that we have many fewer aircraft on alert than we did> during the height of the Cold War. And so, we’ve got just a few bases around> the perimeter of the United States.> [What about the fighters a minute’s flying time from Washington at Andrews> AFB, which were deployed after the Pentagon was hit?]> Myers: So it’s not just a question of launching aircraft, it’s launching to do> what? You have to have a specific threat. We’re pretty good if the threat’s> coming from outside. We’re not so good if the threat’s coming from inside.> [Two planes have hit the WTC and another hijacked aircraft is heading for> Washington and he says you have to have a “specific threat” before scrambling> fighters? And “launching to do what?” Launching to do what they do every week> of the year and as a former commander of NORAD he well knows that. Why were> planes not deployed over Washington as soon as the World Trade Center was> attacked? If it was felt right to do that after the Pentagon was hit why not> before?]> Myers: In this case, if my memory serves me – and I’ll have to get back to you> for the record – my memory says that we had launched on the one that> eventually crashed in Pennsylvania. I mean, we had gotten somebody close to> it, as I recall. I’ll have to check that out. [Remember this is the> top-ranking uniformed military officer in America speaking.] I do not recall> if that was the case for the one that had taken off from Dulles. But part of> it is just where we are positioned around this country to do that kind of work> because that was never – it goes back to Senator Collins’ issue. Is this one> of the things that we’ll worry about. You know, what’s next? But our posture> today is not one of the many sites and the many tens of aircraft on alert. We> just have a handful today.Let us not forget that General Myers said that he headed straight for thecommand centre in the Pentagon after he came out of his meeting on Capitol Hill.The idea that he did not know that morning, never mind two days later, whatfighter jets had been, or not been, scrambled is simply laughable. Of course heknew and what he said until he was faced with uncomfortable questions is thatthey did not scramble jets until the Pentagon was hit. When you have someonepresenting such a travesty of the truth and dithering around unable to answerthe most basic of questions – answers he would clearly have known – the alarmbells begin to explode. Later, Senator Nelson emphasises his point again to thecommittee:> “Mr Chairman, may I, just for the record? Commenting from CNN on the timeline,> 9.03 is the correct time that the United Airlines flight crashed into the> south tower of the World Trade Center; 9.43 is the time that American Airlines> Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. And 10.10am is the time that United> Airlines Flight 93 crashed in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. So that was 40> minutes between the second tower being hit and the Pentagon crash. And it is> an hour and seven minutes until the crash occurred in Pennsylvania.” 24NORAD or snorad?General Ralph Eberhart, Commander in Chief of NORAD and Space Command atCheyenne Mountain, appeared on October 25th 2001 before the Senate ArmedServices Committee Holds Hearing on the Role of Defense Department in HomelandSecurity. By now the new song sheets had been circulated all round. Eberhartsaid that the Federal Aviation Administration did not notify NORAD or theDepartment of Defense that Flight 77 was “probably hijacked” until 9.24am, eventhough it had changed course and turned back at about 8.55 – after the firstplane had already crashed into the World Trade Center. So the plane was“probably hijacked”? Can it get any sillier? Eberhart said: “I show it as 9.24that we were notified, and that’s the first notification that we received. I donot know, sir, why it took that amount of time for FAA. I hate to say it, butyou’ll have to ask FAA.” He was asked if they had now improved the communicationsystem:> “Sir, I assure you that we have, and we practice this daily now, and now it> takes about one minute from the time that FAA sees some sort of discrepancy on> their radar scope or detects a discrepancy in terms of their communication> before they notify NORAD. So that certainly has been fixed.> “I think at that time, the FAA was still thinking that if they saw a problem> it was a problem that was a result of a mechanical failure or some sort of> crew deviation. They weren’t thinking hijacking. Today, the first thing they> think is hijacking, and we respond accordingly.” 25You can see from the evidence presented in the last chapter about the normalreaction procedures of the FAA and NORAD before September 11th that we are beingseriously misled here. If you look at what happened to those planes it was clearto air traffic controllers that the aircraft were not suffering a “mechanicalfailure or some sort of crew deviation” and so why is Eberhart talking suchnonsense? Senator Warner asked Eberhart if the FAA and NORAD had not rehearsedthe possibilities of an aircraft being seized by terrorists. Eberhart replied:> “… although we practice this, day in and day out, the FAA sees on their scopes> scores of problems that are a result of mechanical problems, switch errors,> pilot errors, et cetera, and that’s what they think when they see this”.Oh do come on. Contact was lost with the cockpits, transponders were turned off,there were massive changes of course, and planes were crashing into buildings.Then we are told there were calls from passengers on the planes and “terrorists”heard in the cockpits. Nothing to worry about, Ralph, must be a mechanicalfault. Note also that he says they “practice this, day in and day out … ” usingthe pre-September 11th tense if you read the sentence. Eberhart continued:> “Although we have exercised this, we have practiced it, in most cases it’s a> hijacking like most of the hijackings, all of the hijackings I’m aware of,> where we have plenty of time to react, we get on the wing, and we follow this> airplane to where it lands and then the negotiations start. We were not> thinking a missile – an airborne missile that was going to be used as a target> – a manned missile if you will.> “And in most cases when we practice this, regrettably we practiced it – the> origin of this flight was from overseas and we did not have the time-distance> problems that we had on that morning. We had plenty of time to react. We were> notified that for sure there was a hijacking and we were notified that they> were holding a gun to the pilot’s head and telling him to fly toward New York> City or Washington, DC. So that’s how we had practiced this, sir.> “I certainly wish we had practiced it differently, but I really think that,> for sure in the first two instances, and probably in the third, the time and> distance would not have allowed us to get an airplane to the right place at> the right time.” 26What is this man saying? His operation has access to the most sophisticatedtracking and surveillance technology on earth – and in space – known to man. Twoplanes hit the World Trade Center and he claims they don’t have the time tointercept a plane that turned back 45 minutes before it struck the Pentagon? Hesays that they “were not thinking a missile – an airborne missile that was goingto be used as a target – a manned missile if you will”, but two such “missiles”had already crashed into the World Trade Center before the non-reaction toFlight 77 in Washington by the FAA-NORAD system. Then out came the song sheetwhen Senator Wayne Allard asked him if they had aircraft “at least up in the airwith the second plane to hit the twin towers”. Eberhart replied, “Yes sir.” Thefollowing exchange then took place:> Allard: And so what I’m interested in knowing is, what was the process there> and then, how was that followed-up with the other aircraft that you identified> that were coming or heading toward Washington, and how you responded? And how> was the FAA interacting with NORAD in that whole situation, starting with that> first plane that you deployed heading toward New York City?> Eberhart: Yes, sir. The first flight I think was American Flight 11. [He> thinks?] The FAA, once they notified us and we issued a scramble order almost> simultaneously to the first crash, tragically. That flight of two out of Otis> Air Force Base, out of Cape Cod …> Allard: Let me understand – so right at the time the first aircraft was> hitting the twin towers, you were being notified by FAA that you had another> plane headed toward the towers, you just routinely brought another aircraft …> Eberhart: No, they notified us of the first hijacking just about the time that> that airplane was hitting the tower.> Allard: OK.> Eberhart: And at that time, we issued a scramble order for the two F-15s out> of Otis Air Force Base [even though NORAD was denying this for a week]. We> continued to send those airplanes toward New York City because initially, as> we worked with the FAA, we weren’t sure if that was the hijacked airplane [a> ludicrous statement]. I mean, I hate to admit this, but I’m sitting there> hoping that someone has made a mistake; there has been an accident; that this> isn’t the hijacked airplane, because there is confusion. We were told it was a> light commuter airplane. It didn’t look like that was caused by a light> commuter airplane. [With NORAD’s technology they would have known exactly what> it was, so why is he saying this?] So we were still trying to sort this out,> so we’re moving the two F-15s and we continue to move them. They’re flying> toward New York City. In fact, they are eight minutes away from New York City> when the second crash occurs. We didn’t turn around. We didn’t send them back.> Allard: They hadn’t made a sighting of that …> Eberhart: Again, it’s time and distance. It took them only six minutes to get> airborne. [The US Air Force claims a potential response time of 2.5 minutes> from scramble to 29,000 feet.] Once we told them to get airborne, it took them> six minutes to get airborne. I think this talks about the professionalism and> training of these individuals. Tragically, there was just too much distance> between Otis and New York City to get there in time to …> Allard: Did FAA then notify you that you had a second hijacked plane somewhere> in there, and the planes up there were …> Eberhart: During that time, yes, we were notified, and again we’ll provide the> exact time line for the record.> Allard: I’m not interested in exact time lines as much as I am just how the> FAA reacted with NORAD during this time period. And then you had the other two> planes heading out. Then FAA continued to notify NORAD that you had two other> potential hijackings, these headed for Washington; is that correct?> Eberhart: Yes, sir. The initial hijacking of the one, I think [think?] it’s 77> that crashed into the Pentagon, we were working that with the FAA and we> launched the airplanes out of Langley Air Force Base as soon as they notified> us about hijacking. At that time it took those airplanes, two F-16s, again,> six minutes to get airborne. They were approximately 13 minutes away from> Washington, DC, when that tragic crash occurred. Six minutes to get airborne,> but still 13 minutes to it.I don’t want to worry you, but this guy is the head of the operation that issupposed to protect the United States from attacks from air and space. Betterget that shelter dug smartish. Eberhart also revealed that NORAD helped toprovide the radars used by the FAA to track aircraft in US airspace and thatNORAD has “moved manpower on the order of about 200 people over the years to theFAA to operate these radars”. I wonder if any NORAD staff were on FAA duty thatday? We can’t know because no one is saying and if they did, would you believethem? Eberhart also said that he could not discuss in an open session who hadthe authority to order a commercial plane to be shot down, even though the WhiteHouse had confirmed it was the President before 9/11 and that the head of NORADand a list of other named military men could now issue such an order. Oh, by theway, at the end of Senator Allard’s questioning in which Eberhart’s answers werepathetic to anyone who has looked at what should have happened on 9/11, theSenator said: “Well, I just want to thank you and your people for, I know, Ithink a tremendous effort in light of some totally unexpected circumstances. Andat least, I, for one, appreciate, you know, the readiness that was displayed.” Iknow, incredible isn’t it? But these are the people running our world.Where was Rumsfeld?OK, we have established where General Myers was that morning – nowhere to beseen. But what about the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the number two inthe United States military command structure? It turns out he was working on theeast side of the Pentagon from before the time that Flight 11 took off fromBoston. He told the CNN talk show Larry King Live on December 5th that he was inhis office and was given no warning whatsoever that Flight 77 was heading forWashington before it crashed into the Pentagon.27 Can the official story get anymore insane? Unfortunately it can. This is the headquarters of the US militarywith open lines to NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain with all its satellites, AWACS andground-based surveillance, and with open lines by now with the FAA. Two planeshad already crashed into the World Trade Center and the US Defence Secretary wasgiven no warning that an aircraft was about to crash into the building he wasin, albeit a long, long, way from impact? This is an extraordinary statement andmore transparent tosh. Larry King failed to ask a single question about theDefense Secretary’s ridiculous story, but that, of course, will surprise no one.Rumsfeld related to King that earlier that morning he had told a congressionaldelegation in his office at the Pentagon: “Sometime in the next two, four, six,eight, ten, twelve months, there would be an event that would occur in the worldthat would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people, again, howimportant it is to have a strong, healthy Defense Department that contributes –that underpins peace and stability in our world. And that is what underpinspeace and stability.”28 How prophetic. Then came another outrageous statementthat Rumsfeld made to King. He said that during this meeting in his office …> “… someone walked in and handed me a note that said that a plane had just hit> the World Trade Center. And we adjourned the meeting. And I went in to get my> CIA briefing right next door here, and the whole building shook within 15> minutes. And it was a jarring thing.” 29Now hold on here. The first plane hit the World Trade Center at about 8.46. ThePentagon wasn’t hit until around 9.38. Yet Rumsfeld tells King he was handed anote saying a plane had “just” hit the WTC and within 15 minutes Flight 77crashed into the Pentagon? Are we being asked to believe that the DefenseSecretary wasn’t told about the first plane hitting the WTC until some 40minutes after it happened when he is sitting in his own office at the Pentagonall this time? This is the only way that the “within 15 minutes” can beexplained. Most of America and hundreds of millions across the world werewatching events unfold live on television before 9am and yet the DefenseSecretary, number two only to the President in the US military command, didn’tknow until about 9.20? Where does that leave the “just” hit the World TradeCenter in the Rumsfeld story and why was he not told about the second hit on theWTC at the same time? Rumsfeld’s own Department of Defense manual says: “In theevent of a hijacking, the [National Military Command Center at the Pentagon]will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, withthe exception of immediate responses … forward requests for DOD assistance tothe Secretary of Defense for approval.” 30 Given this procedure alone theSecretary of Defense would surely have been told immediately the first plane hitthe north tower – 50 to 55 minutes before the Pentagon was hit, not 15. In fact,he would have had to be told under the Pentagon’s own procedures immediately itwas known that the first plane had been hijacked. That would have been around8.20 – an hour and 20 minutes before the Pentagon was hit. The lies are just soblatant.The Washington Post reported that after Rumsfeld was informed of the World TradeCenter attack by his Chief of Staff he “stayed in his office on the east side ofthe Pentagon for a scheduled CIA briefing” – note “scheduled” – while “severalof his senior aides rushed to the Pentagon’s command center deep within thefive-sided complex, where a crisis action center [no-action center] was beingset up.” 31 If you only believe the ludicrous official version that Pentagonofficials were given 12 minutes’ warning of the plane heading their way, whywould no one tell the Defense Secretary before he felt his “jarring thing”? And,according to the official story from Rumsfeld’s own military, jets weredispatched from Langley at 9.30 to intercept the plane and yet Rumsfeld andothers in the Pentagon had no warning that the building was likely to be hit?Nowhere, but nowhere, do their pieces fit and there is a very good reason forthat. It’s a pack of lies. I contacted the Pentagon with the following list ofquestions, but officials chose not to answer them.> 1.With the capability of United States air defence, how can a hijacked> airliner, Flight 77, be allowed to fly for 45 minutes towards Washington, with> communication lost with air traffic control and the transponder turned off,> approach a No Fly Zone and hit your headquarters without any challenge> whatsoever?> 2.Why was the Defense Secretary Mr Rumsfeld unaware that the plane was> approaching until the Pentagon was actually struck?> 3.Why was Secretary Rumsfeld not told of the first plane striking the WTC> until around 15 minutes before Flight 77 struck the Pentagon (thus about> 9.20am to 9.25am)? Why was he not told at this time that a second plane had> struck the World Trade Center?> 4.Why was Richard Myers, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not> informed that two planes had struck the WTC and that another was heading for> Washington while he was in a scheduled meeting on Capitol Hill and available> throughout? Why did he only learn of what was happening when he emerged from> the meeting to be told that the Pentagon had been hit? Is there not a constant> communication link between the Chairman and the Pentagon?> 5.Why were the ground to air defences at the Pentagon and the White House not> activated when Flight 77 approached?> 6.Why is there no survelliance camera footage of Flight 77 from much closer to> the point of impact? The pictures released by the Pentagon seem to be a long> way away for a building that must be guarded by a very large number of> cameras, many of them looking outwards.Dan Philbin from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (PublicAffairs) Directorate for Public Inquiry and Analysis merely referred me totranscripts of Pentagon press briefings on the Internet that did not addressthese questions.32 I told him so and asked for direct answers, but he did notrespond. Mind you, if I were the Pentagon I wouldn’t want to be faced withanswering these questions either because to do so credibly is simply notpossible.Where was Bush?So to George W. Bush. Where was he when his country needed a decisive President?He was not in Washington that morning, which doesn’t surprise me at all.Instead, as I have already mentioned, he was back in brother Jeb’s state ofFlorida for a pre-publicised photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker ElementarySchool in Sarasota. What he did that morning, and when and how he heard ofFlight 11 striking the World Trade Center, depends very much on which officialaccount you want to hear. There are several from people like Bush, Cheney andAri Fleischer, the President’s press secretary. Sonya Ross, an Associated Pressreporter, said she knew of the first crash even before Bush had reached theschool that morning:> “My cell phone rang as President Bush’s motorcade coursed toward Emma E.> Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. A colleague reported that a> plane had crashed into the World Trade Center in New York. No further> information.> “I called the AP desk in Washington, seeking details. Same scant information.> But I knew it had to be grim. I searched for a White House official to> question, but none was on hand until 9.05am.” 33If her office knew and enough time had passed for them to call her on acellphone, Bush must have known well before he arrived at the school that theaircraft had crashed into the WTC, and he must have known even earlier thatthere was a hijack in progress on Flight 11. Contact was lost with the aircraftat 8.13am and the President travels with a staff that is in instant contact withthe National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon, which coordinateswith NORAD, the FAA and the government intelligence network. John Cochran, anABC journalist, was reporting Bush’s visit to Florida that day. He told PeterJennings on ABC:> “Peter, as you know, the President’s down in Florida talking about education.> He got out of his hotel suite this morning, was about to leave, reporters saw> the White House Chief of Staff, Andy Card, whisper into his ear. The reporter> said to the President, ‘Do you know what’s going on in New York?’ He said he> did, and he said he will have something about it later. His first event is> about half an hour at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida.” 34How do you explain the report that when Card whispered in the President’s earoutside his hotel that Bush “did not respond”? Would he not have been utterlyshocked and insisted on cancelling the school visit to handle the situation?After all, at that time he was the only one who could give permission for acivilian airliner to be shot down. How could he be ready to react to eventssitting in a classroom listening to children reading? One reason why someonewould not be stunned to hear such information, of course, is if they alreadyknew what was going to happen. At the very least from about 8.46am when Flight11 crashed, the secret service that looks after the safety of the President had“open lines” with the Federal Aviation Administration. This was confirmed byVice President Dick Cheney on NBC’s Meet the Press.35 In truth, the open lineswould surely have been activated earlier than that when Flight 11 began to actvery strangely and dramatically change course. The Bush team in Florida knewprecisely what the FAA knew by that time – indeed suspected from about 8.20 –that Flight 11 had been hijacked. It would have been the most basic securityresponse to keep the President away from a pre-arranged, publicised, event at aschool, especially as it is only five miles from the Sarasota-BradentonInternational Airport. Especially after Flight 11 struck the World Trade Centerthe thought that the President could be a target of a similar attack must haveoccurred to them, yet there appears to have been no discussion about thePresident’s security given these circumstances and off he went to the school asplanned. Did they know something we didn’t?“There’s one terrible pilot”Despite the eye-witness reports of when Bush must have known that Flight 11 wasin trouble, he completely contradicted this – and the earlier accounts of hisown officials – in an extraordinary performance on December 4th at a “townmeeting” at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, where hewas answering non-challenging questions from a sycophantic audience. I actuallywatched this happen live on CNN in a hotel bar. As I sipped my beer anddespaired at the hero worship being enjoyed by a village idiot, Bush made astartling statement about September 11th. For the next two days I scanned thenewspapers, the Internet “news” sites, including CNN, but there was no mentionof the amazing statement he had made. Weeks later a Belgian visitor to mywebsite sent me the words that Bush had said. They were posted on the WhiteHouse website, hidden away in the full and long transcript of the meeting.36Bush was talking about what happened on September 11th and how he heard of theatrocities in New York, in answer to a question from a young boy called Jordan:> “Well, Jordan, you’re not going to believe what state I was in when I heard> about the terrorist attack [well it didn’t show]. I was in Florida. And my> Chief of Staff, Andy Card – actually, I was in a classroom talking about a> reading program that works. I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go> in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower – the TV was obviously on. And I used> to fly, myself, and I said, well, there’s one terrible pilot. I said it must> have been a horrible accident. But I was whisked off there; I didn’t have much> time to think about it. And I was sitting in the classroom, and Andy Card, my> Chief of Staff, who is sitting over here, walked in and said, ‘A second plane> has hit the tower, America is under attack.’”image [../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 18: “Mr President, America is under attack.” “OK Andy, as soon as I’veheard what happens to this goat, I’ll be right out.” A few facts. There was no live television coverage of the first plane hittingthe tower – how could there be? The recorded footage of the first crash did notair until long after Bush went into the classroom where he was told of thesecond crash by Card (Figure 18). The live pictures were of the second planewhen the television networks were already broadcasting shots of the burningnorth tower. How could he, therefore, claim to have seen the first plane strike?This is simply not possible, so what on earth is he talking about? What abouthis reaction of “there’s one terrible pilot”? Uh? A passenger jet crashes into a110-storey building full of people and all the President of the United Statescan say is “there’s one terrible pilot”! We have already seen that Bush musthave known about the first crash before he even arrived at the school and hewants us to believe that the President of the United States, theCommander-in-Chief of US forces and “homeland” defence, would not be told beforethat time how contact with Flight 11 had been lost, its transponder had beenturned off, and that it had veered sharply off-course? Contact was lost at 8.13and the plane did not hit the north tower until about 8.46. The Federal AviationAdministration, NORAD and the National Military Command Center at the Pentagonwere tracking the plane from soon after contact ceased. Bush, remember, saidbefore leaving his hotel for the school that he would “have something” laterabout what was happening in New York and the Associated Press reporter said sheknew of the first crash before Bush had even arrived at the school. Yet he saysthat he saw the plane crash on a television at the school (not possible) and hisreaction was: “I used to fly myself, and I said, well, there’s one terriblepilot. I said it must have been a horrible accident.” Lies, lies, lies again.Bush’s story is also in direct contradiction to the earlier official versionthat he was told about Flight 11 in a call from his National Security AdviserCondoleezza Rice before he went into the classroom.37 This, in turn, contradictsthe accounts of reporters who make it clear that Bush must have known what washappening before he arrived at the school.Then, knowing what had happened and knowing the plane had been hijacked, howdoes the President of the United States react to these monumental events? Hewalks into a classroom to read to children from the second grade and hear themread him a story about a pet goat! As the children read to him he said: “Reallygood readers – whew!” Bush interrupted at one point, saying, “This must be SixthGrade.” God help us. There has just been a catastrophe in New York, MrPresident, involving thousands of people and you know the cause is a hijackedairliner. Hello? When Andrew Card came into the classroom and whispered in hisear that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center and that “America isunder attack”, what does the President do then? He continues to sit therelistening to a story about a pet goat. If you were writing this as fictionthey’d say it was a ridiculous story. Associated Press reported on September12th:> “In Sarasota, Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9.05am> when his chief of staff Andrew Card whispered into his ear. The president> briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy> about a half-hour later.” 38He “briefly” remained somber, or sombre, as we spell it in Britain? He’s justbeen told that a second commercial airliner has struck the World Trade Center.Death and destruction on a massive scale was already obvious and the Presidentknew the first plane had been hijacked before he went into the classroom. Yet heturned “briefly somber” before continuing to focus on the adventures of a petgoat. Jenna Heath of Cox Newspapers’ Washington Bureau reported that Bush “didnot appear preoccupied” as he introduced Education Secretary Rod Paige insidethe classroom and shook hands with teacher Sandra Kay Daniels. “There was nosign that [Condoleezza] Rice had just told Bush about the first attack on NewYork’s World Trade Center during a telephone call,” Heath wrote.39 Look at hisreaction when Card “whispered in his ear” before he left his hotel? “He did notrespond,” said witnesses. Is this really a natural response from a man who hasjust been told of such events in the country he is supposed to be leading? Or isit the response of someone who knew full well what was going on and why? Bushtold the Florida town meeting on December 4th:> “But I knew I needed to act. I knew that if the nation’s under attack, the> role of the Commander-in-Chief is to respond forcefully to prevent other> attacks from happening. And so, I’ve talked to the Secretary of Defense; one> of the first acts I did was to put our military on alert.” 40Bush says he knew he needed to act, but the indisputable truth is that hedidn’t. What’s all this about calling Defense Secretary Rumsfeld? When did he dothat? Rumsfeld told Larry King that even though he was in his office in thePentagon he didn’t know anything was happening until he was handed a note whilemeeting a congressional delegation in his office little more than 15 minutesbefore the Pentagon was struck at about 9.38. We are being told here thatalthough the President knew well before 9am, the Defense Secretary was not tolduntil at least half an hour later even though he was in the Pentagon. Whereveryou look there is a deluge of lies and contradictions. Bush says that he put themilitary on alert, but he could not have done this until he was finished withthe goat story and left the classroom shortly before 9.30 – more than 40 minutesafter the first plane hit. As I mentioned, the official tale (official version99933/S11/666/update/triplicate) is that Bush was taken to a private room beforehe went into the classroom and spoke on the phone with his National SecurityAdviser Condoleezza Rice, who told him about Flight 11. We are told that at thispoint the crash of Flight 11 could have been considered just a “terribleaccident” – an obvious lie. If Bush talked to his National Security Adviserbefore 9am, how come Defense Secretary Rumsfeld says he didn’t know anything foranother 25 minutes? Why was Rice not in immediate contact with Rumsfeld? Whywasn’t the President? Why wasn’t anyone? It was 9.30 – 26 minutes after hearingof the second crash – before Bush went into the school library to announce:> “Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes> have crashed into the World Trade Center, in an apparent terrorist attack on> our country. I am going to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down> and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will> not stand.”No, Mr Bush, you were about to name the patsy and the target that suited theagenda of those who control you. The “folks” are much closer to home, as youwell know.The lie about scare force oneBush was taken to Air Force One, the presidential plane, and even the officialstory says that he did not call Vice President Cheney and put the US military onhigh alert status until at least 10am, by which time the Pentagon had been hit.Bush headed for Barksdale Air Force base, Louisiana, and the US StrategicCommand at Offutt Air Force base in Nebraska, and did not arrive at the WhiteHouse, via the Andrews Air Force Base, until shortly before 7pm. This was morethan ten hours after the first strike on the World Trade Center. Whenunderstandable questions were being asked about why Bush did not head straightfor Washington to lead his country at such a terrible time, the White House saidthat they had received a phone call giving a secret code to say that Air ForceOne was the next target. No they didn’t, that was yet another lie. JohnAshcroft, the Attorney General and the man who delivers “justice” to others,also said the “government has credible evidence that the White House and AirForce One were targets”.41 Lie again. Reports were circulated through the newsagencies on September 12th that quoted a White House spokesman as saying: “Therewas real and credible information that the White House and Air Force One weretargets of terrorist attacks and that the plane that hit the Pentagon was headedfor the White House.” Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, confirmedthis the same afternoon. The Secret Service had “specific and credibleinformation” that the White House and Air Force One were potential targets, hesaid. Bush’s chief political strategist, the Enron shareholder Karl Rove, wasquoted the following day as confirming that the threat came in language thatproved the terrorists had knowledge of the President’s “procedures andwhereabouts”.42 So why did they allow him to attend a publicised appearance at aschool in the circumstances of that morning and why, if there was a specificthreat to Air Force One, was Bush taken straight to the airport to take off inthat plane after he had finished with the pet goat story? Maureen Dowd wrote inthe New York Times that Karl Rove had “called around town, trying to sellreporters the story.” 43 But two weeks later the White House was forced to backdown on the whole fantasy and on September 25th the CBS Evening News reportedthat the call “simply never happened”.44 Most newspapers did not even reportthis fantastic exposure of the lies spewed out daily by the Bush administration,and the Washington Post only ran the story on an inside page.It was this same White House press spokesman, Ari Fleischer, who repeated thelies about Air Force One, which told us how Flight 77 was heading for the WhiteHouse before it “veered off” and aimed at the Pentagon. Vice President Cheneysaid the same on NBC’s Meet the Press. He confirmed that the plane was beingtracked (so why no response?) and “when it entered the danger zone and lookedlike it was headed for the White House was when they grabbed me and evacuated meto the basement …” 45 They waited, he claims, until the aircraft was “in thedanger zone” before evacuating the Vice President when they had been tracking ahijacked plane’s progress towards Washington for some 40 minutes after twoplanes had already crashed into the World Trade Center. The CBS NewsTransportation Correspondent Bob Orr reported that the recorded flight path ofFlight 77 does not support what Cheney and Fleischer claim:> “Eight minutes before the crash, at 9.30am EDT, radar tracked the plane as it> closed to within 30 miles of Washington. Sources say the hijacked jet> continued east at a high speed toward the city, but flew several miles south> of the restricted airspace around the White House.”Once again I sent a list of questions to the White House media office relatingto these events. They were faxed in May 2002, but they chose not to answer.> 1.When did the President know that Flight 11 was in trouble or there could be> a problem? When did the FAA, NORAD, and the Pentagon communicate this> information to the President’s support team in Florida that morning?> Would not respond.> 2.Why, when he was told of the first plane striking the WTC, did the President> continue with his engagement and go into a reading class at the Emma Booker> School?> Would not respond.> 3.Why when told by Andrew Card in the classroom that a second plane had struck> the WTC and that “America is under attack”, did he continue to stay in the> classroom for some time?> Would not respond.> 4.When did the President put the United States military on high alert?> Would not respond.> 5.Why did the President not go back to Washington immediately when we now know> that the story of the telephone warning that Air Force One was the next target> never happened?> Would not respond.> 6.Why did the President tell a public meeting that he saw the first plane> strike the WTC and said “There’s one a terrible pilot”, when he could not> possibly have seen that happen before he entered the classroom? That footage> was not aired until much later.> Would not respond.> 7.Why was the President not considered to be in danger when the attacks began,> and thus removed from the school and a pre-announced visit when the school was> only a short distance from an airport?> Would not respond.Why no evacuation?Another piece of criminal negligence – in truth more than that – was the failureto evacuate the Pentagon, the White House and other major Washington symbolsuntil the Pentagon was struck. This was despite a warning apparently issued tothe Pentagon by the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN, quoting “DefenseDepartment officials”, said that no action was taken for at least 12 minutesdespite warnings that an airliner “appeared” to be heading towards Washington.46(In fact the aircraft must have been tracked heading in that direction for morethan 40 minutes.) American Forces Press Service reported that personnel at thePentagon realised they could be a target long before they were hit: “We werewatching the World Trade Center on the television,” said a Navy officer. “Whenthe second plane deliberately dove into the tower, someone said, ‘The WorldTrade Center is one of the most recognizable symbols of America. We’re sittingin a close second.’” 47 The top people in the Pentagon, apparently, could notsee what everyone else could. Or maybe, I would suggest, some of them could seevery clearly, but did nothing. Retired General Wesley Clark, a former NATOSupreme Commander, said, “We’ve known for some time that some group has beenplanning this, obviously, we didn’t do enough to prepare for such an attack.” 48Officials at the Pentagon, quoted by CNN, said, “no mechanism existed within theUS government to notify various departments and agencies under suchcircumstances”. No mechanism to evacuate the Pentagon with a flying bomb headingin its direction?? In contradiction of this, Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said“to call for a general evacuation, at that point, it would have been justguessing … We evacuate when we know something is a real threat to us.” 49Clearly something is only considered a “real threat” when it smashes into thebuilding. Oh, it was a real threat then; better evacuate, I guess. Newsdayreported that many of the building’s 20,000 workers were still sitting at theirdesks when the plane struck, and some said they heard the crash but didn’t knowthe plane had hit the Pentagon until they saw it on TV! 50 “The first thoughteveryone had was that it had been a bomb,” said Victoria Clarke, a spokeswomanfor Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.51 Only with a hole in the side of the buildingand 125 employees and workers dead was the building evacuated followed by theWhite House, Capitol Hill and elsewhere. None of the Pentagon top brass werekilled or injured because they did not work in the part of the building that wasstruck. General Richard Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hadthe unbelievable nerve to say at a memorial ceremony for the victims that theywere “serving their country” in the course of doing their jobs at the Pentagon,“and on September 11 were called to make the ultimate sacrifice”.52 Sacrifice, Ithink, was the only appropriate word. They were allowed to die, as the recordedfacts make so plain. All this was coldly calculated by those running the 9/11operation because the more death and destruction they could cause, the biggerwould be the problem, the bigger the reaction and therefore the bigger thesolution that could be offered – a war without end and the dismantling of basicfreedoms. The families of those who died in the Pentagon have an open and shutcase for a lawsuit against the US government for the gross negligence that costthe lives of their loved ones. It is, however, as I continue to stress, far morethan “negligence” that is behind all this.And where was “Big Dick”?Representatives of government, “security” agencies and the military at thehighest levels constantly lied over and over about what did and did not happen.Which brings me to Dick Cheney. Where was the Vice President all this time? Hetold the media on September 12th that a clerical secretary watching televisionin his Washington office alerted him to the attacks.53 Oh really, Dick. TheCheyenne Mountain official website says of the NORAD Command Center: “Redundantand survivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center to thePentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters inOttawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centersaround the world.” 54 Yet Cheney, sitting in the White House, says he learned ofthe attacks when a clerical secretary comes in and says, “Hey, you’ll neverguess what I’ve just seen on the telly.” The whole story is a joke. But look atthe common denominator here between Bush, Rumsfeld and Myers, the 1, 2, 3, inthe military command structure, and Cheney. Their stories and actions allensured that they were not in a position to react immediately to events untilafter the Pentagon was hit. Or rather they had an excuse not to do so. Bush wasoccupied with the goat story until shortly before the Pentagon was hit and thenwent straight into another room to make a statement to the media. Rumsfeld gaveLarry King a tale that he knew nothing about the World Trade Center until 15minutes before the Pentagon was hit, and claims no one told him that plane wascoming. “So how could I order a response?” is the obvious implication. Myerssays that he was in a pre-arranged meeting with a senator throughout the periodbetween the first strike on the World Trade Center and the crash, almost an hourlater, into the Pentagon. Isn’t that all so terribly convenient? Another keyquestion is where was Father George Bush, the orchestrator, with Cheney, of theBoy George “Presidency”? He admits himself that he was at the White House thenight before, but says he flew to St Paul, Minneapolis, the next morning. Whattime the next morning? The first plane to be hijacked was Flight 11 at about8.15. Two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center by 9.03 and, if Flight93 had not been delayed well over half an hour before take-off, it is highlyprobable that all four aircraft would have hit their targets by around 9.40.What were Father Bush and Cheney doing while all this was going on?Where were the ground-to-air defences?There is one other massive red flag also, which provides yet more confirmation,as if it were needed, that the attacks of September 11th were allowed to happenby the very authorities that are, in retaliation, waging a global war onterrorism. While I was on a speaking tour in Australia a few weeks after 9/11, Iwas told by a man who is involved with the computer systems of the Australianmilitary that his country’s forces were on full alert status immediately theWorld Trade Center was hit. That makes it more than an hour before America, thetarget of the attacks, was put on the same status by George Bush once he hadfinished with the pet goat and arrived at Air Force One. But the Australiancontact told me something else. He said that the Australian Parliament buildingin Canberra is protected from air attack by hidden ground-to-air missiles. Hesaid that the procedure is as follows: when an aircraft enters the protectedairspace around the parliament building the pilot is contacted immediately by acomputer system that demands he or she punch in a code authorising the plane tofly into that airspace. If this is not done in seconds, the contact told me, thecomputer launches a missile to blow the plane from the sky. Even at the G-8Summit in Genoa, Italy, in July 2001 airspace was closed over the city anddefended with ground-to-air missiles. My Australian contact said he knew for afact that the Pentagon and Washington DC in general are defended by an even moresophisticated missile system than Canberra, but works in basically the same way.It is obvious that this would be the case and it has been openly accepted that aground-to-air system is in place to defend the White House. The Globe and Mailnewspaper in Canada provided one of the rare mentions of the Pentagon system. Itreported: “Meanwhile, there was no explanation of how four airliners could behijacked and flown – in at least two cases hundreds of kilometres and for nearlyan hour – without being successfully intercepted. That one ploughed into thePentagon, supposedly protected by surface-to-air missiles, dramaticallydemonstrated US vulnerability.” 55 Why weren’t those missiles launched to stopthe Pentagon crash? The same reason that the FAA, NORAD and the DefenseDepartment did not scramble fighter jets, or at least not in time. They weren’tmeant to.An insider speaksAfter I had originally completed this chapter I came across an investigativewebsite that claims to have conducted a phone interview on December 9th 2001with a member of the US Air Force based in New York. It was said that thissource was ordered to the crash sites in New York, Pennsylvania and the Pentagonwithin days of 9/11 as part of an Air Force investigation. What he and othersdiscovered, the website claims he told them, was that the standard responseprocedures were fully in effect that morning and were followed to the letter asusual by Air Traffic Control and that Air National Guard and Air Force unitswere alerted immediately it was clear that something was amiss with the fouraircraft. But he said that after these alerts and requests for action werereceived from Air Traffic Control and the FAA, orders from the “highest level ofthe executive branch of the federal government were received, demanding that theAir Force stand down and not follow through with established scramble-interceptprocedures that morning until further notice”.56 This Air Force contact wasunnamed, but then, to be fair, how could he have been? People will just have todecide for themselves if what he is claimed to have said rings true. But it is ascenario that does fit what happened that morning and makes sense of theapparently nonsensical lack of response.No planes were scrambled to intercept the hijacked planes (either at all or intime) and no ground-to-air defences were activated to save the lives of thosewho died inside the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Some would call thisincompetence. But staggering as that alone would be, what happened on September11th is far more than that. It was calculated mass murder. The first positiontaken by the authorities is that there was nothing they could have done. That iswhat they really want you to believe. The second, when that doesn’t work, is tolet you think they were incompetent. Both positions are designed to hide thetruth – the truth that what we are looking at here amid the explosion of liesand diversions is not incompetence at all. This was orchestrated incompetence inwhich forces at, and behind, the highest levels of the United States governmentand military were intervening to stop the system working as it normally would.To stop thousands of people going home to their families that September daybecause it suited the sick agenda for those people to die and for the world towatch it all live on television.But these same forces did not only allow the atrocities to happen. They madethem happen, too.> Postscript:> Bush’s terrorism advisor, Richard Clarke, states in his 2004 book, Against All> Enemies, that he spoke during the 9/11 attacks with General Myers at a> teleconference where he was surrounded by generals and colonels and talking> about one of the wargames that morning codenamed Vigilant Warrior.

They are formed by simple repetition. Tell people something oftenenough and they will believe it. Thus it has become the accepted truth and theofficial history that 19 hijackers working for Osama bin Laden hijacked fourcommercial aircraft, took over the controls, and flew them into the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon while the fourth crashed when passengers attacked theArab pilots. These hijackers, we are told, learned to fly at schools in theUnited States where they trained on small light planes like the Cessna. Keepthat in mind as you read the next two statements. First a report on whathappened when Flight 77 is said to have crashed into the Pentagon:> “The hijacker-pilots were then forced to execute a difficult high-speed> descending turn. Radar shows Flight 77 did a downward spiral, turning almost a> complete circle and dropping the last 7,000 feet in two-and-a-half minutes.> The steep turn was so smooth, the sources say, it’s clear there was no fight> for control going on. And the complex maneuver suggests the hijackers had> better flying skills than many investigators first believed. The jetliner> disappeared from radar at 9.37 and less than a minute later it clipped the> tops of street lights and plowed into the Pentagon at 460 mph.” 1Now the remarks of Rick Garza, a flying instructor at Sorbi’s Flying Club in SanDiego, who remembers trying to teach Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaq al-Hamzi, twoof the Arab “pilots” alleged to have been on Flight 77:> “It was like Dumb and Dumber. I mean, they were clueless. It was clear to me> they weren’t going to make it as pilots.” 2A third “pilot” who is said to have been on board Flight 77 was Hani Hanjour.The FBI announced at first that he was in the captain’s seat performing thathighly skilled manoeuvre to approach the Pentagon and yet instructors at theFreeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland banned him from renting a plane because hewas such a poor pilot only six weeks before 9/11. Clearly there’s somethingseriously wrong here with these stories. But, no problem, no worries, becausewhat happened on those four flights and who was in the cockpits can be revealedby the information secured by the black boxes that contain the flight data andcockpit voice recorders. Er, well, perhaps not. Even though there were two ineach plane we are told that most of them did not survive the crashes in acondition to provide this data and that others did not reveal information thatwould prove what happened. So many fatally damaged black boxes is rather strangeto say the least, given that they are designed precisely to survive intact, aswe have seen so many times in other air crashes all over the world year afteryear. The voice recorders, for example, were recovered from Egypt Air Flight990, which crashed into the ocean, and TWA Flight 800, which exploded in mid airafter leaving New York. A few facts to ponder from a report by ABC News:> “Although investigators look for an entire black box, sometimes the only parts> of the device that survive are the recorder’s crash-survivable memory units> (CSMU). The CSMU is almost indestructible. It is housed within a> stainless-steel shell that contains titanium or aluminum and a> high-temperature insulation of dry silica material.> “It is designed to withstand heat of up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for one> hour, salt water for at least 30 days, immersion in a variety of liquids such> as jet fuel and lubricants, and an impact of 3,400 Gs. By comparison,> astronauts are typically exposed to up to six Gs during a shuttle takeoff.” 3With a beacon transmitter the black boxes can be, and have been, located deepunder the ocean and under piles of rubble when buildings have been struck. TheABC News information is confirmed by the United States National TransportationSafety Board on its official website. It also says that “both the Flight DataRecorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder have proven to be valuable tools in theaccident investigation process. They can provide information that may bedifficult to obtain by other means”.4 What a pity, then, that so many blackboxes were destroyed from four aircraft in four separate crashes. FBI spokesmanBill Crowley said the cockpit voice recorder of Flight 93 found at thePennsylvania crash site was in “fairly good condition”, but had been sent to themanufacturer for help in extracting information after officials with theNational Transportation Safety Board could not get sound from the device.5 TheFBI later claimed to have played this cockpit recording to relatives of thosewho died on Flight 93, but was it the real one? What was heard certainlyappeared to be inconclusive and unclear. The FBI said that the voice recorder onFlight 77, recovered, we are told, from the rubble of the Pentagon, could yieldno information because it was too severely burned.6 A black box can survive heatof 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour! I asked the FBI for details of theblack boxes and their condition, but I was told that this information could notbe given because of the “ongoing investigation”. Every other question about theofficial story was met with the same response.Life’s little miraclesHow amazing that black boxes made of virtually indestructible material can failto survive and yet, according to the always-truthful New York Police Departmentand the FBI, the paper passport of one of the hijackers was found in a New Yorkstreet even though it was in a plane that crashed in a fireball into the WorldTrade Center. Ain’t life just incredible? The “passport” was found a few blocksfrom the WTC “in the vicinity of Vesty Street”.7 Away from the ruins of thebuilding, then, and away from any prying eyes when it was “found”. How aboutthis for a laughable contradiction so typical of the official fairytale. FBIAssistant Director Barry Mawn told a news conference that the passport was found“several blocks” from the World Trade Center and it was possible (I love it)that other personal effects from the hijackers might have been expelled from thecrash scene when the planes made impact. No, really. Mawn said they had launcheda “grid search” of the whole area in the hope of finding other importantevidence. Yet at the same news conference it was said that it was unlikely thatthe remains of the hijackers would be conclusively identified since nothing waslikely to be available for use as a DNA match. What a joke. No bodies survive,just a passport one of them was carrying. I rang New York Police Department torequest more details about this “passport” and their press office put me on to aDetective Burns, a man who, shall we say, was less than helpful. I asked him forthe name of the “hijacker” to whom the passport belonged:> “I don’t think that information has ever been given out.”> “Why not?”> “Because it is part of our investigation and that investigation is still> ongoing.”> “How would that affect the investigation?”> “I don’t know why, it’s part of the investigation, I don’t know why it would> affect the investigation, it has never been given out and the reason it’s> never been given out is because it’s part of the investigation.” [Go figure.]> “So anything that’s part of the investigation, the public’s not allowed to> hear?”> “Not until the investigation is complete.”> “Which is when do you think?”> “I have no idea. You know, information may compromise the investigation, so> that information was not given out.”> “Who knows it and could give it out?”> “It is not going to be given out until the investigation is completed and the> Chief of Detectives gives it out.”> “So we have got to believe it happened, even though we don’t know whose> passport it was?”> “OK.”Detective Burns is another pawn caught in the game. Like airline and airportmedia spokespeople, he can only say what he is told to say from hiscompartmentalised prison. If knowing who owned the passport might prejudice theinvestigation, why announce that you have found one at all? The answer isobvious. Saying that you have found the passport supports the story of who the“hijackers” were and that they were on the aircraft. Telling us who owned thepassport would prejudice, not the “investigation”, but the cover storymasquerading as an investigation. They won’t tell us that “information” becausethe story is nonsense and if there is no passport there can be no “hijacker”owner. There is a simple equation we might consider here – those who tell thetruth do not need to lie. Or, as Mark Twain once said: “When you tell the truthyou don’t have to remember anything.” The official story tells so many lies sooften that it has to remember everything it has previously said. This beingimpossible, given the different voices and departments (and the intellect ofpeople like Bush), it is easy to see why there are so many holes andcontradictions. Given a mainstream media with a modicum of basic intelligenceand an ounce of will and courage to establish the truth there would be famouspeople in jail by now – and they would not be Arabs.The CIA and FBI claimed they had no prior warning of the September 11th attackseven though that is what they are paid to establish. Clearly this is nonsenseand has been shown to be so, but let’s run with it for a moment. Let’s say itwas really true that they didn’t know. This incompetence in failing to trace anyorchestration of such a massive and long-planned attack on US soil would, in anysane society, lead to wholesale sackings and inquiries. But what happened? Bushhas rewarded the CIA and FBI for their “incompetence” by vastly increasing theirbudgets. Again the contradiction can be explained by the realisation that theseagencies were not supposed to stop the attacks before they happened, just as theFAA, NORAD and the Pentagon were not supposed to stop them while they were underway. Having failed, so they say, to track any sign whatsoever of the“terrorists” and their plans before September 11th, the FBI was able to name the19 men it claims were responsible immediately afterwards. What brilliance. Theproblem was that seven, maybe more, of the 19 named by the FBI were found to bestill alive! Now that is some trick, to fly planes into buildings and crash theminto fields, and turn up thousands of miles away within days still very much inthis world. You’ve got to hand it to these Arab guys, they’re so cunning. SaudiArabian Foreign Minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal, revealed through the ArabicPress in New York that at least five Saudi men named were not dead and anofficial at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington DC confirmed to the OrlandoSentinel that four of these still-alive hijackers were Saeed al-Ghamdi, Mohaldal-Shehri, Abdulaziz Alomari and Salem al-Hamzi.8 The list of the “guilty 19”was released by an FBI led by the Bush clone and appointee Robert Mueller, whotook over the organisation only two weeks before September 11th. The followingnames and spellings appeared on an indictment presented by the US government tothe United States District Court in Virginia in December 2001.American Airlines Flight 11Mohamed Atta: an Egyptian national who is said to have been the leader of thehijackers and, says the FBI, the “pilot” who directed Flight 11 into the WorldTrade Center. The FBI also says that he once met with “Islamic extremists” atthe Spanish resort of Salou, although no evidence is produced. Given thestaggering untruths told by the FBI and other government agencies decade afterdecade, and never more so than since 9/11, you’ll understand if I don’t take theofficial information released on these matters at face value. Such “information”is so often of two-faced value. Atta is said to have used the name MohamedEl-Amir when he was an electrical engineering student at the TechnicalUniversity in Hamburg, Germany, where he lived with his cousin Marwan al-Shehhi,who is said to have been on Flight 175. The FBI says that Atta arrived in the USwith al-Shehhi in May 2000 and lived in Florida at Coral Springs, Hollywood, andVenice, where they attended the flying school run by Huffman Aviation before, weare told, training on flight simulators for the Boeing 727 at SimCenter inOpalacka, Florida. Atta and al-Shehhi are reported to have been seen in a bar inHollywood five days before September 11th drinking and playing video games. Oh,fundamentalist Muslims, then?Abdulaziz Alomari: said to have been a Saudi national, who gave an address inJeddah. Alomari was described as a pilot and flight engineer and is claimed tohave once worked for Saudi Flight Ops, a flight maintenance company at NewYork’s JFK Airport. He is reported to have lived with his wife and four childrenin a rented house in Vero Beach, Florida, before leaving on September 3rd andtelling his landlord he was returning home to Saudi Arabia. Video footage fromsurveillance cameras at the airport at Portland, Maine, is said to show Alomariwith Atta boarding a flight to Boston on the morning of September 11th. Orrather it doesn’t. Alomari was found to be still alive, as confirmed to theOrlando Sentinel by the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington. Abdulaziz Alomari,a pilot with Saudi Airlines, walked into the US Consulate in Jeddah to demandwhy he was being reported as a dead hijacker by the American media.9 That wholeFBI story outlined above is nonsense. Another Abdulaziz Alomari, a Saudielectrical engineer, said he lost his passport while studying in Denver,Colorado, and someone could have stolen his identity. He said: “I couldn’tbelieve it when the FBI put me on their list. They gave my name and my date ofbirth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea howto fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.” 10 It seems that the profile ofthe “hijacker” Alomari was a fusion of these two people. Robert Fisk, writing inthe UK Independent, said it was possible that the hijacker adopted Alomari’sidentity, but, as Fisk rightly points out, if he had been using the same falsename while training as a pilot in the US, he would presumably have beenuncovered.11Waleed M. al-Shehri: a “possible Saudi national”, who the FBI says it believeslived in the US from at least 1994 and had both a social security number and aFlorida driver’s licence. He is said to have been a graduate from theEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and owned acommercial pilot’s licence. A neighbour in Florida described him as a “nice guy”who supported the Florida Marlins baseball team. Until 14 months before 9/11 helived at a boarding house three blocks from the CIA headquarters in Virginia,across the river from Washington DC, says the FBI, and when he left he told thelandlord he was going home to Saudi Arabia. As it turns out, that is what hedid. Waleed is still alive. He is a pilot with Saudi Airlines now taking furthertraining in Morocco, according to an official of Royal Air Moroc, and his fathersays that he is alive and well and living in Morocco. So where does that leavethe report by Kay Nehm, Germany’s Chief Federal Prosecutor? He said that WaleedM. al-Shehri belonged to a terror group formed “with the aim of carrying out aseries of crimes together with other Islamic fundamentalist groups abroad, toattack the United States in a spectacular way through the destruction ofsymbolic buildings”.12Wail al-Shehri: also said to have been a pilot by the FBI and “may” have livedin Florida and Massachusetts. Sorry chaps, it seems he is still alive. The LosAngeles Times reported that a man of the same name is the son of a Saudidiplomat in Bombay. “I personally talked to both father and son today,” saidGaafar Allagany, the head of the information centre at the Saudi Embassy.13Satam al-Suqami: believed to be from the United Arab Emirates. It is said thathe had a Florida driver’s licence with an address in Boynton Beach and also helda Saudi Arabian licence. Note that while the two flight attendants who areclaimed to have made calls from Flight 11 both said there were four hijackers,the FBI claims five.United Airlines Flight 175Marwan al-Shehhi: the cousin of Mohamed Atta. The FBI claims that he and Attahad connections in Hamburg with an Islamic group planning attacks on Americantargets. Al-Shehhi was born in the United Arab Emirates, but while in Germanyhis mother said he told her he would not be returning home.14 She felt someonewas listening to their calls and using threats to stop him returning to hisfamily. Al-Shehhi is said to be alive and living in Morocco according to somereports, but I have seen no confirmation of this.Fayez Ahmed (also Banihammad Fayez): “may” have lived in Florida at Delray Beachand although his pilot’s licence lists the address of the Spartan School ofAeronautics, Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is no record that he ever attended theschool.Ahmed al-Ghamdi: “may” have lived in Delray Beach and is reported to have livedat a boarding house near CIA headquarters in Virginia. Waleed M. al-Shehri isalso reported to have lived in that same Vienna house.Hamza al-Ghamdi: “may” have lived in Delray Beach.Mohald al-Shehri: ”may” have lived in Delray Beach. Plenty is known about thesetwo, then. Al-Shehri was yet another who was not on the plane because he’s stillalive, according to the Saudi Embassy.American Airlines Flight 77Hani Hanjour: believed to have been the pilot who crashed the plane into thePentagon, according to the FBI in its first “hijacker” list. But instructors atthe Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland, where he took lessons just six weeksbefore 9/11, said that he was so poor they refused to rent him a plane. Hanjourtook flying lessons at CRM Airline Training in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1996 and1997, we are told, but left before completing the classes he had paid for. TheFBI says that he was given a commercial pilot’s licence in 1999 and gave anaddress in Taif, Saudi Arabia, where, interestingly, the United States MilitaryTraining Mission to Saudi Arabia operates a joint training mission under thecommand of United States Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. Itis claimed that Hanjour joined the Sawyer School of Aviation flight simulatorclub in Phoenix, which gives members unlimited use of a flight simulator. He issaid to have lived in Phoenix and San Diego, taking English lessons at theUniversity of Arizona in 1991 and might have lived in Oakland, California in1996. He stayed with a family in Miramar, Florida, for several weeks and theydescribed him as a “kind and gentle man” who liked children. All in all theperfect profile of a fanatical Islamic kamikaze pilot with brilliant flyingskills intent on mass murder.Khalid al-Midhar (also Mihdhar): The FBI told us there was surveillancevideotape showing al-Midhar meeting in Malaysia with one of the suspects in thebombing of the USS Cole in October 2000, but this is now open to seriousquestion. Al-Midhar is said to have lived in San Diego in 2000, “may” have livedin New York, and joined Gold’s Gym in Greenbelt, Maryland, weeks before 9/11.The FBI says he had two expired visas. Rick Garza, an instructor at Sorbi’sFlying Club in San Diego, described the flying abilities of al-Midhar and hisfriend Nawaf al-Hamzi, as like “Dumb and Dumber”. Al-Midhar would become soafraid during lessons that he would start praying to Allah, so he was just theman for a kamikaze plane hijacking.15 Garza said they called from the MiddleEast to arrange lessons and paid with credit cards in their own names. Plenty tohide then. Al-Midhar was listed as “alive” in yet another list of FBI hijackerscirculated to American banks,16 and Arab newspapers also reported that he wasstill alive. This was the man that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair linked toterrorist attacks against US embassies and the USS Cole in his “evidence”against bin Laden. But the UK Guardian reported that his identity is the subjectof much confusion because it was believed that he was using several aliases and,the paper said, American investigators “are not even certain that his name isreally Khalid al-Mihdhar”.17 How can the FBI be so certain that Khalidal-Mihdhar or Midhar was on Flight 77, and how can they say he was caught onvideo in Malaysia, if they don’t really know who he is? According to Arab News,a young Saudi computer programmer called Khalid al-Mihammadi was confused withal-Mihdhar and had “the shock of his life when he saw that his picture was amongthe suspects who had hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 that crashed into thePentagon in Washington on Sept. 11.” 18 Al-Mihammadi had studied English in theUnited States for nine months, but had returned to Saudi Arabia earlier in theyear. Associated Press reported that “officials, speaking on condition ofanonymity”, said they were exploring several possibilities: al-Midhar neverentered the country and his name was used as an alias by one of the hijackers;he allowed his name to be used on the flight by another hijacker to kid USofficials that he died; he did in fact die in the crash as a hijacker.19 Thereis a fourth possibility, of course: the whole story is bollocks.Nawaf al-Hamzi: we are told that, with al-Midhar, he bought a Toyota Corollabearing California licence plates. He was the other half of “Dumb and Dumber”.Al-Hamzi’s San Diego landlord said he helped him to open an account at the Bankof America and showed him how to write an advertisement in English on theInternet looking for a Mexican wife. Yep, sounds like we have another Islamicfundamentalist on our hands here. The manager of his apartment block inClairemont, San Diego, says he was a model tenant who often dropped in forcoffee and cookies.20 Flying instructor Rick Garza described al-Hamzi ascharming. He had a “great, great personality”, and was “someone you could becomeattached to very quickly,” Gaza said. “They [came] back to say goodbye, that’show nice they were.” Garza remembered how they said: “We’ll come see you onceour English improves.” 21 Al-Hamzi’s father says that the photograph of his sonreleased by the FBI looks nothing like him and had been fabricated. Heapparently issued a picture of his son that was clearly different from the onecirculated by the FBI.22Salem al-Hamzi: brother of Nawaf and believed to have lived in Fort Lee andWayne, New Jersey. The FBI says he was one of the group that attended Gold’s Gymin Greenbelt, Maryland. Well he had a long way to travel just to keep fitbecause the Saudi Embassy in Washington confirmed he is still alive and works ata petrochemical plant in Yanbou, Saudi Arabia.23 Once again his father says thatthe picture issued by the FBI bears no resemblance to him, and produced his ownpicture to prove it.24Majed Moqed: also said to have attended Gold’s Gym in Greenbelt betweenSeptember 2nd and 6th with Khalid al-Midhar, Nawaf al-Hamzi, Salem al-Hamzi andHani Hanjour. An employee at the gym said they refused long-term membership andpaid for the sessions with “a wad of cash”. He was seen on a surveillance camerawith Hani Hanjour using an ATM machine in Laurel, Maryland, on September 5th, orso it is claimed.United Airlines Flight 93Saeed al-Ghamdi: The FBI says he “may” have lived in Delray Beach, but the SaudiEmbassy revealed that he is still alive and has been working for Tunis Air. Hesaid: “I was completely shocked. For the past 10 months I have been based inTunis with 22 other pilots learning to fly an Airbus 320. The FBI provided noevidence of my presumed involvement in the attacks.” 25Ziad Jarrah: “may” have been a pilot says the FBI, but his mother, NafisaJarrah, told the London Daily Mirror that her son was no Muslim fanatic. He hadattended an evangelical Christian school in Lebanon and later said he “wouldn’tmind marrying a non-Muslim”. He enjoyed dancing, loved his family, immersedhimself in western culture and loved to socialise. He was planning to marry hisTurkish girlfriend two weeks after September 11th. She was a student at theAmerican University in Beirut, which has a reputation for attracting thechildren of the westernised elite of the Arab world. They later moved touniversity in Germany and she reported him missing after the 9/11 attacks. Hisuncle, Jamal Jarrah, was quoted in the UK Independent of September 16th assaying:> “He was so normal. His personality and his life bore no relation to the kind> of things that happened. He led a very normal life. He had girlfriends, he> went to nightclubs, he went dancing sometimes.”The article says that everyone who knew Ziad Jarrah said he was a happy, secularyouth, who liked women and that he never showed any interest in religion andnever visited the mosque for prayers. The media claimed that his Turkishgirlfriend Asl had said that he disappeared for a while and went to Afghanistan.But in a telephone conversation witnessed by Ibrahim Awadh of the Saudi ArabianArab News Staff, Jamal Jarrah, the alleged “hijacker’s” uncle, asked Asl if shehad made such a statement to the media. She angrily replied: “From where theyget all this? It is all lies. I did not speak with anyone. The police did notallow me to talk with anyone, even on the telephone. I am speaking to you now inthe presence of police.” She was also asked if she had ever seen Mohamed Atta oranyone else who appeared on the list of suspected hijackers, but she saidemphatically no. She added: “Listen, Jamal. You know we were about to getmarried. Ziad was a jovial and kind-hearted gentleman. I loved him with all myheart, and we were preparing to return to Lebanon for our wedding.” 26 ZiadJarrah’s tutor at Greifswald’s Arndt University, Gudrun Schimpfky, said: “He wasjust a lovely, kind young man.” 27 If you read the background to Jarrah, theidea that he was an Islamic extremist who would carry out such attacks cannot besustained.28 So what has happened to him? Why did he go missing?Ahmed al-Nami: “may” have lived in Delray Beach, says the FBI. Oops, sorry, butold Ahmed is still with us and he was shocked to see himself named as ahijacker. He had never lost his passport and said it was “very worrying” thatthe FBI could name him without any checks being made. I’m afraid that’s par forthe course, Ahmed. Another man mentioned by the FBI as a hijacker suspect, aSaudi national called Ameer Bukhari, was dropped from its wanted list when itwas found that he had died a year before. Good decision, boys. Muhammad Bukhari,another Saudi Airlines pilot, was arrested because he was apparently mistakenfor a Saudi suspect called Adnan Bukhari, who was himself found by the FBI andis no longer a suspect. Even so, reporters gained access to his home in VeroBeach and broadcast live reports from his living room!Ahmed al-Haznawi: “may” have lived in Delray Beach, Florida. Wow, massivedossier on him I see.This is pretty much all the FBI can tell us and Director Robert Mueller wastwice forced to admit on CNN that there is “no legal proof to prove theidentities of the suicidal hijackers”.29 Mueller also admitted in a speech tothe Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on April 19th 2002: “In ourinvestigation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper – either here inthe United States or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up inAfghanistan and elsewhere – that mentioned any suspect of the September 11plot.” This after what Attorney General John Ashcroft described as “perhaps themost massive and intensive investigation ever conducted in America”.30 Muellersaid that 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support workers, some 25% of FBIemployees, had been assigned to the case. These included more than 400 FBI crimelab experts who were sent to the crash sites. Ashcroft said that investigatorshad received more than 100,000 tip-offs and Mueller said there were “over200,000 leads we are investigating”. So why have they found bugger all? Why doesthe official story, so confidently delivered as “fact”, turn out to be just aludicrous pile of mights, mays, maybes and “suicide hijackers” who are stillalive? Mueller claimed that some of the suspected hijackers and theiraccomplices had ties to several terrorist groups, but he “declined to providedetails”.31The first FBI list of “hijackers” was released on September 14th and then a newlist was issued on the 27th with slightly different spellings, and additionalnames and aliases.32 Either way, at least seven of the 19 named by the FBI werefound to be alive and the first FBI list names seven as pilots and the secondonly six. Hani Hanjour was no longer listed as a pilot, no doubt because givenhis flying record the idea that he flew a commercial airliner for 45 minutes andthen executed that fantastic turn into the Pentagon is insane even by FBIstandards. Nationals of Saudi Arabia dominate the list and they were led, it isclaimed, by Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian, on behalf of Osama bin Laden, who is amember of a Saudi Arabian family. There is not one name on the list fromAfghanistan. Yet the “war on terrorism” was launched against Afghanistan withSaudi Arabia paraded as one of the countries in the US “anti-terroristcoalition”! In December 2001, after those alleged hijackers were found to bealive, the FBI and the United States government were still naming the same menin the indictment against an alleged accomplice, Zacarias Moussaoui, in theDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division.Where are the “hijackers”?American and United Airlines released “partial” passenger lists for the fourhijacked planes and not one contained any of the “terrorists” named by the FBI,nor even anyone with an Arabic name. The airlines said that some passengers werenot listed because their next of kin had yet to be informed. That would not haveapplied to the hijackers, though, surely, so why were they not there? I met withMichael Woodward, the American Airlines Flight Services Manager at BostonAirport, who says he took the call from attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney shortlybefore Flight 11 crashed. I must say he didn’t seem very at ease as we spoke,especially when I said the government’s version of events was clearly ludicrous.He told me that when he took the call from the plane he punched up the passengerlist for Flight 11 on his computer screen and Atta’s name was there in the seatthat Sweeney had mentioned. But a BBC report, The Last Moments of Flight 11,points out that Sweeney said there were only four hijackers while the FBI saysthere were five and that “the seat numbers she gave were different from thoseregistered in the hijackers’ names”.33 Another attendant, Betty Ong, gavedifferent seat numbers for the hijackers in her call. I asked the FBI to explainthese inconsistencies, but it would not give me an answer. In fact fivepassengers are missing from the list released for American Airlines Flight 11and eight for AA Flight 77. It is the same story with the lists issued by UnitedAirlines. Nine names were absent from UA Flight 175 and 12 from UA Flight 93.If the “hijackers” were on those planes then surely check-in staff wouldremember them. After all, when you travel by air inside America you don’t tendto see that many Arabic people and as these guys were supposed to have flown inbusiness class and first class they would have had their own check-in desks andattendants with far fewer passengers to deal with than those checking in economypassengers. There were very light passenger loads on all four planes anyway. Weare told that Atta was in first class and if he was on board there is no way thefirst-class check-in attendant would not have remembered him, especially as hewould have had to present a photo ID that matched his face and name with histicket. When my wife later asked Michael Woodward if he could put me in contactwith the check-in staff that dealt with Atta and company that morning, he pausedand said: “Mmmm, I don’t know who that would be.” Maybe it’s just me, but Ifound that a strange statement five months after the attacks. If you had taken acall from someone on a hijacked airliner that then crashed into the World TradeCenter, wouldn’t you want to know from your colleagues who did what and whatexactly happened that morning? Was there never any conversation between staff infive months about who checked in these guys, what happened and what they werelike? I find that bewildering. He said he would find out the name of thecheck-in person for me, but when he did not reply over the next three days Ireturned to Boston Airport in search of the person who checked in Atta and hisfellow hijackers. I talked to a check-in staff supervisor on duty at Americanand asked him about speaking to the check-in staff in business and first classon September 11th. But he became very agitated and would not even tell me hisname. He went over to a check-in computer, refusing to enter into anyconversation, to find the number of the American Airlines media centre in Texas.Asked why he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, speak to me, he replied, “It’s for personalreasons”, and would say no more.The airline responseI asked the American Airlines corporate headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, ifthey could confirm that the alleged hijackers passed through their check-insystems at Boston Logan and Washington Dulles. Tim Kincaid, Manager ofCommunications Planning, American Airlines Corporate Communications, repliedthat I would have to ask the FBI!34 I asked if I could speak with the check-instaff that dealt with the “hijackers” to confirm that they went through. Kincaidreplied: “Sorry, no.” Rich Nelson, the media spokesman for United Airlines basedin Chicago, told me the same. When I asked if he could confirm that the mennamed as hijackers passed through United’s normal check-in procedures at BostonLogan and Newark, New Jersey, Nelson also referred me to the FBI. I could notspeak with the check-in staff involved, he said, out of respect for theirprivacy.35 However, I heard a very different story from Stanley Hilton, the SanFrancisco lawyer who has filed a $7 billion lawsuit against Bush and othermembers of his government on behalf of families who lost loved ones in theattacks. The lawsuit alleges that the government knew the attacks were comingand I’ll talk more about this later. Hilton told me that clients who work forAmerican Airlines, flight attendants and pilots, had been subjected to “verytough gag orders” and were threatened with “immediate termination if they talkabout any of this publicly”. That would certainly explain my own experience withAA staff at Boston Logan and why should we think it would be any different atUnited?I said to Tim Kincaid at American Airlines that when they released passengerlists for Flights 11 and 77 there were five names missing on Flight 11 and eightfor 77. I said I understood the original reason given for some of the passengernames not being there – next of kin not yet notified – but why were there nonames for the hijackers on those lists? Kincaid’s reply: “Sorry, you’ll need tocontact the FBI.” I said that given that the next of kin for all the passengerswill now long have been informed, could I have complete passenger lists forFlights 11 and 77? Kincaid referred me to the American Airlines website for newsreleases for September 2001, which merely had the original lists with the namesmissing. I went back to ask if the incomplete passenger lists released onSeptember 12th were the only ones they had published. He said that the newsrelease “is the only one we put out and is as complete as we could make it”. Heexplained that “some families asked that their loved one’s name not be listed,and [they had] honored their wishes”.36 But this is not the reason originallygiven for the missing passengers, which was that next of kin had not beeninformed. Are we to believe that by some fantastic coincidence the very samenext of kin who had not been informed soon enough for their loved ones to beincluded in the first list are the very same next of kin who decided they didnot want the names of their loved ones to be published? And where are thehijackers? I contacted Kincaid again: “What do you mean by “as complete as wecould make it? Why no hijackers anywhere?” His reply: “That’s as much as we canshare. Call the FBI.” 37 All this time later we have still not had a fullpassenger list for the 9/11 flights and not seen the airline ticket and boardingpass documentation of the “hijackers” who are claimed to have been on thoseplanes. I asked Kincaid, a pleasant guy merely doing his job, if I could I seecopies of the paperwork detailing the calls made by Betty Ong and Madeline AmySweeney to AA ground staff from Flight 11, but it was the usual reply: “Contactthe FBI.” 38 Rich Nelson, the media spokesman for United Airlines, told me thatthey only released the names of those whose families authorised them to do so.39Then there is the matter of the passenger numbers on the four flights involved.OK, it was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week I understand, but these werepan-American flights leaving at a time to coincide with the start of thebusiness day on the west coast in major cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Yet Flight 11 had only 81 passengers on a plane that can carry 158 (AmericanAirlines figures); Flight 175 had 56 passengers on a plane with a capacity of168 (United Airlines figures); Flight 77 was carrying 56 passengers when thecapacity was 176 (American Airlines figures); and Flight 93 had just 38 on aplane capable of holding 182 (United Airlines figures). We have four aircraftleaving from three airports, all hijacked in well under two hours, all left totheir fate with no effective reaction from the FAA-NORAD response system, thePentagon or government, and all remarkably low on passengers. I asked AmericanAirlines for the average number of passengers on Flights 11 and 77 throughoutthe year 2000. They told me: “This information is proprietary and not available,sorry.” 40 At least I wasn’t told to contact the FBI. Rich Nelson at UnitedAirlines said that, beyond saying that Tuesdays are typically light days, hecouldn’t tell me the average passenger numbers for those flights because it wasconsidered to be “proprietary information.”41Even with the small number of passengers we are still told that between four andfive hijackers without guns could overpower and control two pilots in eachplane, and between 43 and 90 passengers and flight attendants, using box cuttersand knives. On Flight 77 alone was attendant Michelle Heidenberger who had been“trained to handle a hijacking”, reported the Washington Post. “She knew not tolet anyone in the cockpit. She knew to tell the hijacker that she didn’t have akey and would have to call the pilots. None of her training mattered.” 42 Therewere some big guys on these planes, in the cockpit and among the passengers.Mark Bingham, a 31-year-old rugby player, was an enormous man who stood six feetfive and Jeremy Glick, a former national Judo champion, were both on Flight 93,for example. Judo is an art of self-defence, not least against people withknives.The cover-up techniqueI contacted the FBI and was advised to fax a list of my 47 questions to RexTomb, a representative for the FBI’s Fugitive Publicity and Internet MediaServices Unit. Many of these questions were the ones I had asked the twoairlines and other organisations involved in September 11th, which they told mecould only be answered by the FBI. (You can read them in Appendix 1[../Text/index_split_028.html#filepos1972322].) A few days later I received afaxed reply from Ernest J. Porter at the Office of Public and CongressionalAffairs saying that Mr Tomb had given my questions to him. Mr Porter said thathe regretted being the bearer of disappointing news, but it was not possible forthe FBI to answer any of my questions. The news was not, in fact,“disappointing”, just depressingly predictable. Mr Porter told me: “It will besome time, perhaps years, before the FBI’s investigative files on this case maybe available through vehicles such as the Freedom of Information Act. Theanswers to your questions may be found in the files at that time.” 43 One of myquestions was “When did Robert Mueller officially become head of the FBI! Ifinformation is considered dangerous to “national security” (and the authoritiesdecide that) those files can be withheld under the Freedom of Information Actand, when you look at the way freedoms are being destroyed by the week, what isgoing to be left of that Act by the time the 9/11 files are up for release? It’sa smokescreen, of course it is. When you look through the questions I faxed toRex Tomb you can see how basic some of them are and how many relate to FBIstatements made immediately after 9/11 when its leadership was telling thepublic the official story of what happened. The propaganda and cover-uptechnique comes clearly into focus. It is the same technique used with all suchset-ups: (1) you give the media the “information” about the event that tells thepublic the story you want them to believe; (2) you tell everyone with anyknowledge or relevant information about the event that they must pass allinquiries to the FBI; (3) the FBI then says it cannot answer questions about itsofficial story because of the “ongoing investigation”. Funny how the “ongoinginvestigation” did not prevent the FBI from announcing its version of whathappened. It only becomes a problem when the FBI is questioned about thatversion. There are many decent, dedicated people working for the FBI, but whenit comes to the positions of power the bureau is not there to uncover the truth,but to prevent it ever being known.Mind gamesBefore I continue to explore the fantasies of the official story, it isimportant to stress the potential the Illuminati have for mind control. Thiscould well have been employed as part of the 9/11 operation. Within theIlluminati network going back beyond the start of conventional human historythey have held the knowledge of how to control a person’s mind and manipulateits reality. In my other books I have detailed the background to government mindcontrol projects in which children are taken at a very early age and turned intotraumatised zombies with their minds no longer their own. The foundation ofthese projects worldwide is a technique called trauma-based mind control, andthis is another way that the satanic networks of the Illuminati fit into thepicture. The mind has a defence mechanism that shuts out, or“compartmentalises”, the memory of extreme trauma. This is why people cannotremember the moment of impact in a serious road accident. Their mind creates anamnesic barrier around the event so they don’t have to keep reliving thathorrible memory. From ancient times this has been understood by the Illuminati.In the concentration camps of Nazi Germany the method of exploiting thispotential for mind control was further perfected. Joseph Mengele, the infamous“Angel of Death”, and his fellow Nazis realised that if you could systematicallytraumatise someone through torture, sexual abuse, and by sacrificing andtorturing others as they watched, you could shatter a person’s mind into ahoneycomb of self-contained compartments or amnesic barriers. Satanic ritualsare widely used to do this. The mind’s unity shatters into these variouscompartments or “alters” as they are called in the mind-control business. Eachcompartmentalised “alter” is unaware of the existence of the others. Each onethinks it is the whole mind when, in truth, it is only a fragment detached fromthe rest of itself.Once in this compartmentalised state the fragment, or “alter”, can be programmedfor various tasks or experiences. The victim is given a programmed “frontalter”, as they call it. This is the day-to-day personality that people interactwith, and their friends and acquaintances think is “them”. Using trigger wordsor hypnotic keys, sounds or signals, the compartments can be pulled forward orpushed back like a mental filing cabinet, replacing the front alter for a taskor experience – anything from having sex with a famous person to assassinatingan Illuminati target. When this task or experience is over, the manipulatorsbring back the “front alter” to resume its role as the conscious mind onceagain. This means that after the victims have performed a task, they forget whatthey have done and who with. In this way, world-famous people have sex withchildren, but the children can’t remember it has happened. It is only many yearslater – often not even then – that they remember their experience as thecompartments start to break down and flood those memories into the consciouslevel as “flash-backs” of what happened (see The Biggest Secret and Children OfThe Matrix). This compartmentalised condition has become known as MultiplePersonality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The latteris more accurate because the compartments are not “personalities” as such; theyare fragments of mind that have “disassociated” – become detached from – therest of the consciousness. It is like moving a radio dial across the stations,the compartments, tuning into one and then another. Even this technique isprimitive compared with the latest methods using technology. All this must betaken into account when making judgements about September 11th. Suicide bombersaround the world are overwhelmingly multiple-personality-mind-controlled stoogesand once they are given the trigger to activate the programming they will doanything that the programmed responses command.Many soldiers become multiples when they experience unimaginable slaughter.Their minds suppress the memory and they have no recollection of what they saw.Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich, a professor at Tubingen University in Germany,wrote a classic study of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) and “demonicpossession” in 1921 called Possession, Demonical and Other. This revealed thattrauma-based mind control was being used in France, Germany, and Belgium longbefore the dawn of the 20th century. Survivors and professionals have told ofhow the British used agents programmed through MPD in the First World War.Although the trauma may be forgotten, the subconscious memory is still affectingthem and their lives, physically, mentally and emotionally. Many people who aresexually abused and systematically traumatised as children appear mentally andphysically unstable, especially if the programming has stopped and thecompartment walls begin to dismantle. I have sat in on sessions with the Britishtherapist Vera Diamond and seen people switch between vastly differentpersonalities one after the other by the use of a single word or sentence. It isincredible to experience. One of her clients has to be attached to a plastic bagthat collects her urine because her bladder has been destroyed by torture. Hermedical records are so enormous it shocked a doctor who saw them. This lady wasjust … 30 years of age. Mind control can also put people in the wrong place atthe wrong time so they can be blamed for something they didn’t do. You can alsomind control a pilot to do what you programme him to do and he would have noidea that this was so until the trigger word or code was given and theprogrammed compartment took over his thinking processes. I would urge you toread the lengthy and detailed section on the mind-control programmes in TheBiggest Secret because they open up so many other possible explanations ofevents and behaviour convenient to the Illuminati. The number of people undermind control of this kind today is simply staggering.I must say that, along with many others, I have great doubts that ZacariasMoussaoui, the so-called “20th hijacker”, is in control of his own mind. Peoplewho met him as part of his legal defence described him as “confused” and in needof a psychological examination. Lead defence lawyer Frank Dunham saidMoussaoui’s behaviour “caused us to question his mental status”. As I completedthis book, Moussaoui was in the process of going to trial for his involvement inthe September 11th attacks. He was in custody on that day for immigrationoffences, but the authorities claim that he was part of the plot and had he notbeen arrested he would have been on Flight 93. He appeared in court inAlexandria, Virginia, on July 18th 2002 and entered a plea of guilty, but thejudge rejected that and asked him to think about it further. “I am guilty”, hesaid, and he added: “I am a member of al-Qaeda. I pledge bayat to Osama binLaden.” (Bayat is apparently the loyalty oath taken by members of al-Qaeda.) Hetold the judge that he had been involved in the plot since 1995 and had “many,many information [sic] to give to the America [sic] people about an existingconspiracy”. Moussaoui was in court to face a “superseding indictment” by thegovernment that made adjustments to make him eligible for the death penalty. Thecharges involving a potential death sentence were conspiracy to commit acts ofterrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraftpiracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft and conspiracy to use weapons of massdestruction. Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, told the judge: “Iwant to enter a plea today of guilty, because this will ensure to save my life.”He said that he had “certain knowledge about September 11” and he went on: “Iknow exactly who done it, I know which group, who participated, and I know whenit was decided.” Here was a guy who claimed allegiance to Osama bin Laden andwas supposed to be willing to die, in his eyes gloriously, in a suicideterrorist attack against the “Great Satan”, the United States. Yet now he wassaying that he would tell all, reveal details of an “existing conspiracy” andadmit to everything, so long as the US government would spare his life. He hadpreviously entered pleas of not guilty while, at one hearing, publicly prayingfor the destruction of the United States and Israel and for the death of hisyet-to-be-selected jurors. But now “not guilty” became “I admit everything”.Moussaoui was representing himself after submitting a staggering 94 hand-writtenmotions declaring his wish to do so. Standby defense attorney Frank Dunham toldCNN that he didn’t believe Moussaoui was agreeing to plead guilty to the chargeshe faces. “If someone went over the indictment with him line by line I don’tbelieve he’d agree to all of the charges,” he said, “What he’s admitting to isnot consistent with what he’s charged with.” US District Judge Leonie Brinkematold Moussaoui it might be in his best interest to enter into plea bargainnegotiations with the government. “You cannot plead guilty and then say, ‘But Ididn’t do this and I didn’t do that and somebody else did that,’” she said.Moussaoui became agitated by this and replied: “For the guilt phase, I’m guilty,but for the death penalty, we will see.” He said that a jury “will be able toevaluate how much responsibility I have in this.” A week later, on July 25th2002, Moussaoui pleaded guilty to four of the six charges against him – the onesthat carried the death penalty. Judge Brinkema explained that this meant heaccepted responsibility for involvement in the planning or execution of theattacks. The judge questioned him about his involvement and it became obviousthat he was not, in fact, admitting that he had taken part in the 9/11conspiracy. After a recess, he withdrew his guilty plea and quoted Hamlet: “‘Tobe or not to be, that is the question.’ I say: To plead guilty or not to pleadguilty, that is the question”. Judge Brinkema said it was “absolutely right” and“not an unwise decision” to withdraw his guilty plea. She had already indicatedthat she would be unlikely to accept it. I think it is worth remembering herethat the bumbling, confused, bizarre and contradictory behaviour of Moussaouicomes from a man that the US government claims was fundamentally involved in theplanning of the hijack of four planes in American airspace and part of a plotthat is claimed by the authorities to have been brilliantly hatched and carriedout by highly skilled and highly professional terrorists. How ridiculous it allis. Just before the court hearing closed, Moussaoui said that a British agentwas “an important part of the conspiracy”, and he would reveal more when he hadhis day in court. Moussaoui’s trial was set for late September 2002 and you maywell be aware of the outcome by the time you read this. Moussaoui is a patheticpawn in a game he doesn’t even begin to understand and no doubt his “trial” willbe designed to be a platform to yet again sell the official version of September11th. Maybe the FBI will use the trial to present some of the “evidence” it hasrefused to reveal or talk about in the year since the attacks, although itcertainly didn’t do that in the trial of Timothy McVeigh.The “ringleader”Most of those who met the alleged hijackers appeared to be astonished that theycould have carried out such attacks. They were “ordinary” people or, as onearticle put it: “Friendly neighbors, serious students and model dads: the mensuspected of hijacking the jets that carried out history’s deadliest terrorstrikes looked a lot more like the guy next door than the incarnation of thedevil.” 44 The focus has been on 33-year-old Mohamed Atta as the “ringleader” ofthe “hijackers”. His father, Mohamed al-Amir Atta, a retired Cairo lawyer, said:“Oh God! He is so decent, so shy and tender. I used to tell him ‘Toughen up,boy!’” 45 In a statement to the London-based al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper onSeptember 22nd 2001, his father said that Atta was in Germany and that he hadphoned him after the attacks.46 He claims that on September 12th he was at hisholiday home on the Mediterranean coast without radio or television and unawareof the attacks in America the previous day. He says his son called him there andthey talked about “normal things”. Only later that day did he hear what hadhappened in the United States, he said.47 He also dismissed the suggestion thatAtta was a supporter of al-Qaeda: “Mohamed, my son, hates Osama bin Laden likehe hates the sinner. Do not forget that Osama bin Laden is behind the attack onour embassy in Pakistan. Mohamed is a real Egyptian. All this talk is nonsense.”48 He said he believed that his son’s identity had been stolen. Given that somany of the alleged hijackers are still alive, that is not such a fantasticstatement. If, in fact, he didn’t die on the plane, it is highly likely he waskilled soon afterwards to protect the official story or he may be anintelligence asset of some kind playing his part in orchestrating the coverstory. Who knows? His father said that Atta doesn’t know how to fly a plane andin fact is frightened of flying, always vomiting when he travelled by air. “Hewas a donkey when it came to politics. I advised him, like my father advised me,that politics equals hypocrisy,” he said.49 He said his son was brought up tolimit social contact to concentrate on his education.Atta grew up in a middle-class home in Cairo and had two sisters. One is auniversity lecturer and the other a doctor. He became an architect and urbanplanner, and from 1992 studied at Hamburg’s Technical University in a city thatis home to around 80,000 Muslims of various nationalities. Professors apparentlyremember him being quiet, but not a radical thinker. Ralph Bodenstein, a fellowstudent who spent three months with him on a field study in 1995, said: “I knewhim as an idealist who had great dreams about people living together.” 50 Othersremember him as intelligent, polite and tolerant of other religions.51 DittmarMachule, his German professor, told the Wall Street Journal: “I never heard anyanti-Zionist, anti-American or anti-Christian statements from him.” Othersrecalled how he condemned terrorist attacks on tourists in Egypt. In 1999 hepresented his thesis on the restoration of the old quarter of the city of Aleppoin Syria and his 152-page study argued that urban planning should reflect thetraditional coexistence of Muslims and Christians.52 Atta appears to haveregistered with Bab Souria, formerly known as Syria Online, in 1997 under thename Mohamed El-Amir asking for information about Aleppo. The story goes that hehad disappeared from the university from mid-1997 to October 1998 and when hereturned, according to the New York Times, he had changed. He now wore a beardand persuaded the university to provide a prayer room for himself and other Arabstudents, including al-Shehhi and one other “suspected hijacker”, a Lebanesestudent named Ziad Jarrah or Jarrahi, who studied aircraft design. He was theone who liked nightclubs and was due to marry his Turkish girlfriend two weeksafter September 11th. Atta was outspoken, we are told, about the government ofEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak and sympathised with the Muslim Brotherhood,Egypt’s most established religious political organisation, and intellectualsfacing persecution by Egyptian authorities. (Must be a terrorist then, I guess?)He also criticised the “fat cat” families and officers close to the Mubarakregime, enriching themselves while the larger community suffered.53 (So do I.) Arestoration project around Cairo’s old city gates, Bab Al-Nasr and Bab Al-Futuh,which involved knocking down the homes and workshops of the poor, “made himangry” and he said it was a completely absurd way of developing the city to turnit into Disneyworld, recalled fellow student Ralph Bodenstein.54 (Quite righttoo.) Some recalled that Atta criticised the United States for the Gulf War, itsdomination of the United Nations and Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians.55(So do I) Another “fellow student” was quoted by the German newspaper Die Zeitas saying that Atta was “very sceptical about the achievements of the Westernworld” and “the ever accelerating Americanisation of his homeland [and] theentry of modernisation into the Arab world did not please him.” Big deal. I amfar more than just sceptical about the achievements of the western world and therampant imposition of its “culture”, but that does not mean I want to killmyself in an airplane crash and take thousands of people with me.The FBI says it believes that Atta first arrived in the United States in 2000with al-Shehhi and, in November and December of that year, it claims that Attapurchased flight deck videos for the Boeing 747 Model 200, Boeing 757 Model 200,Boeing 767 Model 300ER, the Airbus A320 Model 200 and other items from a pilotstore in Ohio. This is thought to be Sporty’s Pilot Shop at the Clermont CountyAirport about 20 miles from Cincinnati, although the owners won’t confirm thisexcept to say they have spoken with the FBI. Nawaf al-Hamzi, who is alleged tohave been on Flight 77, is said to have bought similar videos from an “OhioPilot Store” and so is Zacarias Moussaoui, a 33-year-old (at the time of arrest)French national, who was indicted after 9/11 for being involved in the plot.56Officials say that Atta was given his visa at the US Consulate in Berlin on May18th 2000 and landed at Newark, New Jersey, on June 3rd on a flight from Praguein the Czech Republic. He overstayed his visa by more than 30 days, but wasallowed back for another six months when he returned to the US with no questionsasked by immigration.57 This is not normally the case when previous visas havebeen overstayed. Some who claim to have met him and rented him rooms in Americahave been quoted in the media as saying he was cold, distant and secretive. Theytalk of his stare, like the one portayed in the picture distributed to the mediaby the FBI. We need to be very careful about those “remembering” someone afteran event has happened in which a person has been named as responsible. I learnedyears ago as a journalist that in such circumstances “witnesses” often have“memories” that fit the situation they have been told has happened. Others havesaid that Atta was mild-mannered, attentive and courteous. Over a period of timemost of us would be described in different ways by different people, dependingon the mood we were in when we met them and whether we liked them or they pissedus off.There have been many false or unsubstantiated claims against Atta and much“information” has been presented as “proof” when it is nothing of the kind. Hewas said to be wanted for the bombing of an Israeli bus in Jerusalem in 1986 andone newspaper report said: “He was so brazen that he crisscrossed US andEuropean borders under his own name while listed as a suspect in a 1986 Israelibus bombing.” But Brigadier General David Tsur, the Chief of Staff of theIsraeli Ministry of Public Security, said that Atta was not the man suspected ofthe bombing.58 The wanted man was Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta (also known as MahmoudAbad Ahmad), a 33-year-old (in 1986) Jordanian who ambushed a bus in the WestBank.59 Mohamed Atta was said to have met with an official of Iraqi intelligencein Prague in April 2000 and this was used to implicate Iraq with the attacks.Iraq denied this and, once again, no evidence was produced except for Secretaryof State Colin Powell saying the information came from Czech Prime MinisterMilos Zeman. In May 2002 the International Herald Tribune reported a senior Bushofficial as saying there was no evidence that Atta met the Iraqis in Prague.60The whole story is claimed to have come from Czech “intelligence” thinking thata man seen on surveillance camera footage was Atta, but this turned out not tobe true. The Herald Tribune further revealed that no evidence whatsoever hadbeen found that Atta had left the United States and visited Prague at thattime.61 See how “history” and “truth” are created from utter crap? But what thepeople retain is not the detail that destroys the story, but the “image” thatthe sum total of the lies and false statements presents to them. Atta wasreported by “witnesses” to have been at the Professional Aviation FlightTraining University in Punta Gorda, California, but when the FBI checked thestory he had never attended that flying school.Atta is claimed to have been seen in Norfolk, Virginia, in the winter of 2000where he “might” have been surveying the US naval base as a possible target. Whosays so? The FBI through Newsweek. He “might” have been “casing” Boston’s LoganAirport more than six months before. Who says so? Newsweek. Sources? The usual.The Chicago Tribune said that he was a member of the Egyptian Jihad group withties to Osama bin Laden. Who said so? “Sources”.62 The FBI said that Atta flewfrom Miami, Florida, to Madrid, Spain, on July 9th 2001 and picked up a rentalcar ordered through the Internet.63 The Observer newspaper in London claims tohave seen hotel records confirming that Atta spent at least one night at theMontsant hotel in the resort town of Salou on Spain’s eastern coast during thistrip and he returned his Hyundai Accent rental car to Madrid airport on July18th, less than two months before the attacks.64 It is claimed that he went toSalou to meet with four unidentified Muslim extremists. Who says so? A Spanishnewspaper. Sources? “Investigators.” Oh, them again. Now I am not saying thatany of this is true or not true, just that all the “evidence” we have is fromagencies with a genetic condition widely known as “lying through your teeth”.The FBI claims that Atta met an “al-Qaeda” operative called Ramzi bin Shibh inSalou. Shibh is claimed to have once shared an apartment with Atta and “theauthorities believe” he may have been involved in the planning of 9/11 fromGermany.65 But the International Herald Tribune, reporting the New York Times,said that investigations in Salou by the FBI and Spanish intelligence had foundno one who saw the two together at the resort. Another point to note here: Attaand Marwan al-Shehhi were alleged by the FBI in a court indictment in December2001 to have bought a knife in Zurich, Switzerland, on July 8th 2001. How couldAtta do that if, as the FBI also claims, he didn’t fly from Florida to Spainuntil July 9th?66The official story says that Atta drove some 3,200 miles in rental cars inAmerica between August 6th and September 9th, a period of more than a month.This is seen as significant, but I have driven that distance in half the time inrental cars in America. Is that significant? He and al-Shehhi apparently walkedinto Warrick Rent-A-Car in Pompano Beach, Florida, on August 6th. Brad Warrick,the owner, said that Atta carried a briefcase, was polite and looked like abusinessman. “He didn’t spend money like there was an unlimited source. Hesquabbled a little bit over mileage”, Warrick remembers, and after renting aChevy Corsica for a week, Atta switched to a Ford Escort because it cost tendollars less. Yet Atta was said by other “witnesses” to have unlimited funds andwads of notes in his pocket. Warrick said the two Arabs were always “uncommonlypolite” and always “… had a briefcase and books in the trunk”.67 Thisdescription of Atta’s demeanour is at odds with reports from the flying schoolswhere he is described very differently. Warrick said that on one occasion Attaphoned from Venice, Florida, to say that the oil light had flickered on and whenhe returned the car on September 9th, just two days before the attacks. Atta hadreminded him about the problem. “The only thing out of the ordinary was that hewas nice enough to let me know that the car needed an oil change,” Warrick said.“That was odd since he was planning to die in a matter of days.” 68 Or was he?Warrick said he found it odd that Atta had been concerned about the condition ofthe car when he returned it just two days before the hijacking. “I mean, ifyou’re going on a suicide mission, why not leave the car at the airport?” 69Precisely. You’ll never get a job with the FBI, Mr Warrick. Atta was lucky notto be stopped by a traffic cop (very easy, as I know, when travelling thosedistances in cop-happy America) because in the April he had been given a ticketfor driving without a licence and didn’t show for a court hearing. The benchissued a warrant for his arrest, but the police failed to act on it.70 Heoverstayed his visa, but no action was taken. He skipped a court appearance andhad an arrest warrant issued, but nothing was done. Lucky man. Atta is said tohave rented a Piper Archer single-engine plane at Palm Beach County Park Airportin Lantana on August 16th, 17th and 20th or on three consecutive days fromAugust 19th, depending on which report you read. The manageress told the mediathat he said he had wanted to complete 100 flying hours. On August 28th he issaid to have used a Visa card to buy two one-way tickets on the Internet forFlight 11 … quoting a frequent flyer membership number obtained only three daysbefore! Anyone who has frequent flyer membership knows how long it takes tobuild up enough free miles to make it worthwhile – in Atta’s case it would havebeen long after September 11th had passed. Why is he collecting the miles if heplans to kill himself days later? The other ticket, we are told, was in the nameof Abdulaziz Alomari, or whoever that was because Alomari is still alive.On September 7th, Atta was said to have been at Shuckums Oyster Pub and SeafoodGrill in Hollywood, 30 miles from Miami, with Marwan al-Shehhi and another man,according to the night manager, Tony Amos, and they stayed from around 4.30pmuntil about 7pm.71 Waitress Patricia Idrissi told the media that one of themwent to play a video machine at one end of the restaurant while Atta andal-Shehhi sat drinking and arguing. Al-Shehhi drank rum and coke, she said,while Atta downed five Stolichnaya vodkas with orange juice. The bill was $48and Atta argued with the manager about it. This is a guy with a pocketful ofnotes who, we are told, was only four days from driving a plane into the WorldTrade Center? “You think I can’t pay my bill?” Atta is said to have shouted. “Iam a pilot for American Airlines. I can pay my fucking bill.” Mmmm. Did hereally mention American Airlines? Seems very convenient to me. He paid the billfrom a “thick wad” of $50 and $100 bills, staff said, so why the argument aboutthe cost only days before September 11th? This is just silly. Islamic lawstrictly forbids drinking alcohol. Atta’s father said: “If my son sees you witha beer, he’ll cross the road” and he was “very shy, very polite, would neverswear”.72 He said it was “… like accusing a decent, veiled religious girl ofsmuggling prostitutes into Egypt. It is nonsense, imagination!” 73 Other reportshave said that al-Shehhi did all the boozing, which, if true, casts still moredoubt on the “American Airlines” statement that Atta is said to have madeaccording to the same witness who claims he drank five vodkas. But whether itwas al-Shehhi or both of them hitting the bottle, these people are claimed to beIslamic fanatics willing to kill themselves and thousands of others for theirfaith. Yet they drink such a fundamentally banned substance in public oranywhere else? It just doesn’t add up. Azzan Ali, a friend of Atta and al-Shehhiwhen they were students at a Florida flying school, said: “They were veryreligious.” 74 Then there were the reports of other “Islamic fundamentalists”drinking in a strip bar the night before September 11th. Associated Pressreported on September 13th: “Three men spewed anti-American sentiments in a barand talked of impending bloodshed the night before the terrorist attacks.” JohnKap, a strip club manager in Daytona Beach, told FBI investigators that the menin his bar used credit cards to spend $200 to $300 each on lap dances anddrinks, the report said. “They were talking about what a bad place America is,”Kap is quoted as telling the FBI. “They said ‘Wait ’til tomorrow. America isgoing to see bloodshed.’” It’s all so convenient. Kap said that he gave the FBIthe men’s credit card receipts, photocopied driver’s licences, a business cardleft by one of the suspects, “a copy of a Koran that one of the men had left atthe bar”, the Associated Press report claimed. Pardon me? A Muslim “fanatic”would take a Koran into a strip bar and leave it there? Oh do let’s be sensiblehere. These alleged “hijackers” and “accomplices” seem to have left copies ofthe Koran everywhere they went – how perfect for the cover story. What werethese guys, the Islamic version of the Gideons? The Associated Press articlesays that the FBI told Kap not to reveal the names of these men. The Arab Newsof Saudi Arabia asked:> “How could the hijackers themselves have been ‘Islamists’ if they frequented> bars, drank in some cases beer and wine, and one even attended an evangelical> Christian school and stated that he would not have minded marrying a> non-Muslim? How can we have faith in the investigations when almost half of> the original list of hijackers have turned out either to be dead [before the> event] or alive and well in other parts of the world?” 75A writer on the Liberty of Freedom website said:> “Ziad Jarrahi, the alleged Lebanese hijacker of the plane which crashed in> Pennsylvania, had a Turkish girlfriend in Hamburg and enjoyed nightclubs and> drinking. Yet at the same time, we are being told that these same hijackers> spent the night before the attack getting drunk in bars, making noise,> screaming insults at the “infidels”, and doing everything they could to> attract attention to themselves.

Whatwe are seeing here are the staged events designed to build the cover story andhide what really happened and who was really responsible. This is very easybecause the mainstream media simply accepted this fairy story without question.I remember seeing a television “documentary” about Mohamed Atta on the UKchannel, ITV, in which Jonathan Dimbleby, one of Britain’s best-known currentaffairs presenters, repeated the FBI cover story without question from start tofinish. Unbelievable.Miracle journeyThe day after Atta was apparently seen at the bar in Florida, a man of MiddleEastern appearance walked into the control tower at Boston’s Logan Airport, saysome reports, and it was believed this could have been him. Well if it was, thatwas a bloody quick flight from Florida to Boston and where are the details ofhis ticket? Also, Atta returned his rental car to Warrick Rent-A-Car in Floridathe following day, the 9th. So for that to have been Atta, he must have flownfrom Florida to Boston on the 8th, walked up to the control tower at theairport, and then flown back again to Florida to take the rental car back. Thenhe must have flown back to Boston again to rent another car and drive toPortland, Maine, if the story is to be believed. This is how silly it gets.Several hours before this “Atta” figure showed up at the Boston Airport controltower, it is said that four “Middle Eastern men” had asked a controller how toget into the tower. This begs the question of what “Atta” and these other menexpected to gain by getting into the tower. What would it have told them? Itwouldn’t have helped them hijack the planes three days later in any way. What itwould have done is attract attention to them and suspicion, the last thing theywould have wanted so close to their “big day” at the very airport where theywere acting suspiciously. But, on the other hand, if you were setting up a coverstory for September 11th you would want “Middle Eastern men” acting suspiciouslyat the airport where the first two planes were to be hijacked. I asked the FBIabout the “Atta” man and the other four at the control tower, but officialsrefused to answer my questions.The official story cannot explain, it would seem, what happened to Atta after hereturned his rental car to Warrick in Florida on September 9th until he hiredanother car at Boston Airport on the 10th. “It is unsure how he travellednorth,” said one report I read.77 Well let’s just look at it logically, just forthe benefit of the FBI leadership. He was in Florida one day and Boston thenext, and the distance between them is 1,673 miles. So, er, he didn’t walk and,er, he didn’t drive, and, er, he didn’t sail. Ah, got it. He must have flownthen. So where are the flight details and ticket bookings that would be simpleto find? Exactly. I asked the FBI about this and officials refused to answer.The FBI tale is that after arriving in Boston on September 10th Atta andAbdulaziz Alomari rented a Nissan Altima from the Alamo company at Boston LoganAirport and drove just over 100 miles to Portland, Maine. They are said to havestayed overnight at a Comfort Inn before heading the next morning for PortlandAirport and a plane back to Boston to pick up Flight 11. In Maine, investigatorsclaim that Atta and Alomari met up with other hijackers who came into the UnitedStates from across the Canadian border.78 These other men are said to havedriven back from Maine to Boston Airport while Atta and Alomari flew to Bostonthe next morning. In Portland, on September 10th, five Arab men, “believed” tobe the “hijackers” and including Atta, tried to buy or rent cellphones from astore, investigators say.79 They were refused at first because they did not havethe proper identification, but that all changed when the men paid $3,000 incash.80 Why would you not pay cash anyway if you had “wads of notes” and knewyou were going to die the next morning? If they did not have properidentification to buy cellphones, how did Atta manage to hire a car that sameday? How did they manage to buy air tickets because that is what they now triedto do, we are asked to believe.81 You have just got to hear this next bit. Themen are reported to have used their new phones to call the airport at Bangor,Maine, to get a flight to Boston, but they could not get one with the righttimes. They then allegedly called the Portland International Jetport where twomade reservations – clearly this is supposed to be Atta and Alomari. The otherthree men are believed, according to some reports, to have returned to Boston inAtta’s rented Nissan, but police say they found this car at Portland Airport.82If they did, how did these other “hijackers” get to Boston Logan to connect withFlights 11 and 175? If they didn’t use Atta’s rental car they must have hiredanother or gone by plane. Where is the documentation? No one seems to ask thesequestions. Let’s just take a breath here. Highly trained terrorists with thebrains and organisation to hijack four commercial airliners within the same hourin American airspace, take over the controls and direct them to their target,wait until the day before to book seats on planes to connect with the flightsthey have planned meticulously for years to hijack? And they only buy cellphonesat that time also? What? But hold on, there’s more.Atta and Alomari are said to have been caught on video at Portland as theyboarded a USAir flight for Boston on that morning of September 11th. Well for astart that wasn’t Alomari on the videotape as we were told because he is stillalive. But, despite this, we are asked to accept without question that the otherguy was Atta. Maybe it was, but we don’t know for sure. Atta’s father said: “Theman in the video is bigger than my son”.83 Some more questions arise here. Whywould the leader of the biggest plane hijack in history, an attack years in theplanning, risk flying into Boston that morning and giving himself only an hourand a quarter between landing in Boston from Portland and taking off on Flight11? Why would he wait until the day before to book his ticket? And wait forthis. On the videotape released by the FBI of “Atta” and “Alomari” getting onthe plane at Portland is the time code 05-53-41 (Figure 19). That’s just 19seconds short of six minutes to six. I know you can work that out, but it isworth emphasising because the flight they took from Portland to Boston thatmorning, USAir Flight 5930, was scheduled to depart at … 6am. That’s only sixminutes after “Atta” and “Alomari” were “captured” on videotape passing throughsecurity! No wonder they were described as “rushing” for the plane. The FBItimeline says that Atta and Alomari checked out of their hotel in Portland at5.33am, just 27 minutes before their plane was due to depart and they then hadto park their rental car, check in and get to the gate. One airline employeetold reporters: “The girl that checked Atta said he was sweating bullets, thathe was running late. His forehead was drenched.” 84 Anyone who travels by airknows that if you leave it that late you are highly likely to miss the flight.Not only did the leader of the biggest plane hijacking in history take thechance of flying into Boston from a connecting flight that morning, he arrivedso late that the Portland plane left only minutes after he got to the gate. Andhe only secured a seat the day before? All that planning and he took those risksof not even getting to Boston? What was that the Washington Post said about the“… astonishing degree of organization and planning undertaken by theterrorists”?85 Hilarious. “Astonishing degree of organization and planning? Itwas more like the Keystone Cops. No, sorry, that’s the FBI (or what decent andintelligent agents in the FBI are forced to be by their superiors). I asked theFBI about all these anomalies and contradictions, but officials refused toanswer my questions.On the Portland airport security video a second time code appears in the centreof the screen – the last place you would put a time code on a surveillancevideo. This code reads 05.45 and appears to be only there to hide the ridiculouscontradiction of a highly professional leader of the hijackers running to hisplane at six minutes to departure. The way the shot is framed by most of themedia only the second time code in the middle of the screen is included, not thetrue one at the bottom of the frame. If this second, centre-of-the-screen, timecode was correct, it means that Atta and friend must have checked out of theirhotel, taken their car to the airport car park, checked in and passed throughsecurity to the gate all in 12 minutes! I rang Ruth Dudley, a very nice lady,who is Head of Security at Portland Airport. I asked her why there were two timecodes – one of them slap bang in the middle of the screen. She said she didn’tknow and would have to see it to give me an opinion. Unfortunately, she said,they didn’t have those tapes anymore because they were immediately confiscatedby the FBI. I asked the FBI why there were two time codes on the video and whyone was in the middle of the screen, but officials refused to answer.image [../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 19: “Mohamed Atta” and “Abdulaziz Alomari” caught on an airport securitycamera rushing for their plane at Portland, Maine, on the morning of September11th. Note the difference between the time code in the centre of the frame(which is the last place you would put it) and the one at the bottom (where youwould put it) that shows that there are only six minutes before the plane leaves Other “hijackers” arrived at Boston Airport at about 7.15am in a whiteMitsubishi Mirage with Virginia licence plates, we are told.86 The car contained“five” Arab men (three in other reports) and in one window was a pass allowingaccess to restricted areas at the airport, the FBI says. Media reports (officialstatements) claimed that another (unidentified) “witness” remembered the fivemen because there was an argument over a parking space. Note that time again.They arrived at 7.15am for flights taking off just before 8am and they are stillin the car park, yet to reach the check-in desk and go through security to thegate. Anyone who has travelled in the United States will know that queues forcheck-in can be long at that time in the morning and the “five Arab men” left itridiculously late to arrive at the airport on that day of all days. Then theyalso wasted more time arguing about a parking space? Why are they leaving it sotight when they have planned these attacks for years, according to the FBI, andwhat are they doing worrying about a car space when they are about to killthemselves? What this story does, however, is place “Middle Eastern men” in theBoston Airport car park that morning. But hey, not only did these guys leave itso late, they were said in one report to have bought their tickets in cash whenthey arrived at the airport. The “Mitsubishi” hijackers are reported to have“paid $4,500 each for their last-minute first-class tickets …” when they arrivedat Boston Airport on the morning of September 11th.87 David Boeri on NewsCenter5 in Boston reported: “Sources say at least four suspects, described as MiddleEastern men, arrived late to the airport, purchased one-way tickets and paid incash for them, all of those factors being known security risk flags”.88 He saidsecurity personnel were trained to question late-arriving passengers who pay incash for tickets. Surely “highly trained” hijackers would know this?They arrive in the Boston Airport car park only 45 minutes before departure, letalone actual boarding, and according to these reports, they still don’t havetickets for the flights they intend to hijack. Why did they not secure places onthe flights long before to ensure that years of planning would not be destroyedby “sorry sir, the flight is full”? I asked American Airlines to confirm howAtta booked and paid for his tickets on Flight 11, but I got the usual reply:“Contact the FBI”. I asked when and how others named as hijackers by the FBIbooked and paid for their tickets on Flights 11 and 77 – “Contact the FBI”.89Rich Nelson, media spokesman for United Airlines, told me the same: “We have notcommented on that. Only the FBI, which is leading the investigation, could orwould answer that.” 90 I asked the FBI to confirm how each of the men named ashijackers had purchased their tickets, but officials refused to answer. TheBoston Channel, however, reported how “FBI investigators detained andinterviewed Logan Airport ticket takers who may have been the last people whocame into contact with the hijackers before they boarded the two flights to NewYork.” The report said that a Gismond Pepin was behind the ticket counter butdidn’t notice anything unusual when the two flights boarded, she told the FBI.She is quoted as saying:> “They asked me if I seen anything out of the ordinary, but it would have been> something I would have called to my manager’s attention if I would have seen> it at the moment, but unfortunately, nothing caught anybody’s eye that was> suspicious.” 91However, the indictment in the case against alleged terrorist Zacarias Moussaouipresented to the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofVirginia, Alexandria Division, in December 2001, claims that 14 of the 19 namedby the FBI purchased their tickets in the following way. Khalid al-Midhar andMajed Moqed bought tickets with cash for American Airlines Flight 77 “on orabout” August 25th 2001, but it doesn’t say where. Waleed al-Shehri and Wailal-Shehri made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11 “on or about” August26th, listing a telephone number in Florida as a contact number. The next day,the indictment claims, Fayez Ahmed and Mohald al-Shehri made reservations forelectronic, one-way tickets on Flight 175, listing the same Florida phonenumber, and Nawaf al-Hamzi and Salem al-Hamzi booked flights on AmericanAirlines Flight 77. On or about August 28th, Satam al-Suqami paid cash for aticket on American Airlines Flight 11, the FBI say, and Mohammed Atta andAbdulaziz Alomari booked two seats on Flight 11, listing the same Floridanumber. The following day Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Hamza al-Ghamdi reserved one-waytickets for Flight 175 and Ahmed al-Haznawi purchased a ticket for Flight 93from Newark, but the indictment does not say how or where. Clearly many of thesepeople didn’t do that because they are still alive.Camera shyI have noticed that many people seem to believe they have seen video footage ofAtta and friend getting on to Flight 11 at Boston. This is because people tendto get an impression from a news item, not the detail. The only pictures we haveseen of two “hijackers” getting on a plane anywhere were recorded as they wentthrough security at Portland, Maine, not Boston, because it turns out that,despite being an international airport, Boston Logan had no surveillance camerasin the departure lounge. As one newspaper article put it: “In perhaps the moststunning example of Massport’s lax security safeguards, Logan InternationalAirport is missing a basic tool found not only in virtually every other airport,but in most 7-Elevens” (a chain of small food stores for those not familiar withAmerica).92 Massport runs Boston Logan Airport and almost every other transportoperation in the city it would seem. I went to see its media spokesman when Iwas speaking in Boston in February 2002 and he said that Massport was notresponsible for security. He confirmed there were no video cameras in thedeparture lounge, but they did now have face-recognition cameras taking stillpictures to ensure that the person who checked in was the person getting on theplane. The US military is also all over the airport and now controls theoperation since September 11th, giving orders to the civilian authorities. TheBoston Herald article pointed out that this lack of cameras in the departurelounge has prevented the FBI from definitively identifying the men who boardedthe planes. How strange that in these times when you cannot move without beingwatched by a camera somewhere around you, they did not have them at aninternational airport, but they did have them at a small regional one atPortland. Such cameras had been in widespread use in airports for some 15 yearsbefore 9/11. Michael Taylor, President of American International Security Corp.of Boston, said: “It’s not rocket science, convenience stores employ them, whywouldn’t Massport?” The absence of cameras where you will find them at almostevery other similar airport is another one of those endless coincidences thatcontinue to surface. This means that the evidence is simply not there to provethat the “hijackers” named by the authorities were on the Boston planes. CharlesSlepian, a New York security consultant, said:> “You have names, but the FBI has said it hasn’t been able to match the faces> of those who were on the flights. Who boarded at Logan? You don’t have> pictures, and that’s a problem. And are those suspects the ones who actually> got on at Logan or are they still alive? Who knows? That’s one of the big> questions the cameras would have been able to answer.” 93How convenient that at Boston Airport of all places they can’t do that. Funny,too, how there are 17 surveillance cameras constantly filming the roads betweenthe Ritz Hotel and the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in Paris and they would have provedbeyond question what happened to the car in which Princess Diana died in 1997.Unfortunately, for reasons never explained, none of them was working the nightshe died (see The Biggest Secret). Sometimes cameras are useful to theIlluminati when they want to see us, but they can be a real problem when theywish to hide themselves and their activities. Still, hold on: we may not be ableto confirm that the FBI “names” boarded the flights from Boston Logan becausethere are no cameras, and the airlines won’t let me speak to the check-in staff,but they do have cameras in parking garages, ramp areas and on Logan’s roadwaysto monitor traffic. Why haven’t we been shown video pictures of these “MiddleEastern men” who arrived in the car park at 7.15 and had the argument with theunnamed driver about the car parking space? What about the men we are toldarrived at the car park in their vehicle several times in the days beforeSeptember 11th? Where is the footage of the other hijackers arriving thatmorning? If five came in the Mitsubishi, and Atta and friend arrived on theflight from Portland, what happened to the three other men the FBI says were onthe two Boston aircraft? Surely the “Middle Eastern men” who asked how to getinto the control tower must be on tape somewhere as well as the one who seems tohave got in “unaccompanied”. Indeed, the Boston Globe reported on September13th:> “When they reviewed videotape of the parking lot’s surveillance camera,> investigators found that the car had entered the lot up to five times between> last Wednesday and Tuesday, according to sources. Those sources said the> constant presence of the car over the last week suggested that the terrorists> had scouted the airport, or performed dry runs for the daring attack.” 94Who was seen on the tape getting in and out of the car on these “videos”, then?If they have footage of that, where is the recording of the “Middle Eastern men”arriving in the white Mitsubishi on the morning of September 11th and having theargument over a parking space with an unidentified driver?95 I asked the FBI allthese questions, but officials refused to answer. Another thing. Michael Taylor,president of American International Security Corp., says he has worked for thePort Authority of New York and New Jersey, and he confirmed that Newark, NewJersey, from where Flight 93 departed, has video cameras in the departurelounge. Why haven’t we been shown footage of the “hijackers” boarding thatflight?96 Dulles International Airport in Washington DC, the starting point forFlight 77, also has cameras in the departure lounge, so same question. I putthis very point to Tara Hamilton, a very pleasant woman, in the media office atWashington Dulles Airport. She replied:> “I’ve checked with our airport police department and they inform me that the> FBI is in charge of all information regarding September 11th and the specifics> about the men who came to Dulles Airport. In regard to questions about our> airport cameras, those are part of our security system and we’re not able to> discuss that. I’m sorry we’re not able to provide the information you are> seeking but am sure you understand our situation.” 97Well actually, no I don’t. If releasing video footage of “Atta” and friend atPortland airport is OK, what is the problem with letting us see other“hijackers” boarding planes at other airports? Like all of these mediaspokespeople, Tara Hamilton was just saying what she was told to say, and theidea that asking for confirmation that the “hijackers” were caught on camerawould in any way affect the airport security system is ridiculous. They don’twant to discuss it, that’s the truth. I asked the FBI why these pictures had notbeen released, but officials refused to answer.Even without the cameras at Boston, however, the gods clearly wanted to help theFBI and other government “investigators” to find those responsible. Of all theluggage of all the passengers on all the airlines in all the world on that dayof all days, it was Atta’s bag or bags that didn’t make it on to Flight 11.98Inside, the FBI says, was a note dated five years earlier in which he said hewas willing to martyr himself in a holy war against infidels. Yeah, course hedid.99 Yawn. It is claimed to give instructions for Atta’s burial and whatshould be done with his possessions “when I die”. The Los Angeles Timesreported: “Authorities said Atta instructed that he be buried ‘next to goodMuslims,’ with his body pointed east toward Mecca, that strict Muslim traditionsbe followed for his burial and that no women be allowed at his funeral. Thedocument is dated April 11th 1996, “suggesting that Atta may have beenconsidering a suicide attack for several years before he carried it out.” 100This included the fact, apparently, that he wanted to “go to heaven as amartyr”.101 How they can say this without laughing is beyond me. It’s not even aB-movie script. But hold on what’s this? Oh my God! They only found in Atta’sbags a copy of the Koran, a Saudi passport, and … oh no… a video of how to fly acommercial airliner. Bingo! Game, set, and match, all sorted, doubles all round.After the attacks, police say they found Atta’s red 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix inthe parking lot of Logan Airport and the rented Altima in Portland. Why wouldAtta rent the Altima at Boston Airport to drive to Portland if he had anothercar already at Boston? Where did this car come from when he had been at theother end of America, in Florida, with another rental car until September 9th?Florida police understandably appealed for anyone who might find the Grand Prixin the area where Atta was said to be living.102 Instead it turned up in aBoston car park 1,673 miles away and yet Atta went to car rental companies inFlorida on the 9th and Boston on the 10th, according to the official story. Dothe sums and you find that even if Atta maintained a speed of 100 miles an hourfor the entire journey (no chance, he would have had so many speeding tickets)with no hold ups or stops whatsoever, it would take nearly 17 hours to completethe journey. Not worth even going there, it’s so stupid. Yet the Chicago Tribunesaid: “Sometime before the attack, Atta, perhaps accompanied by al-Shehhi, madehis way up the Eastern Seaboard. After Tuesday’s attack, police found Atta’sGrand Prix in the parking lot of Boston’s Logan International Airport.” 103 Ifthey had only stopped to think instead of taking the official story withoutquestion, the reporters would have seen how ridiculous that is.Another point. Why the hell a man who is about to fly an airliner into the WorldTrade Center would take bags with him and check them into the hold is beyondanyone with a neuron pathway even partially active. But, like I say, miracles dotend to happen with government cover stories. In fact miracles are essential.And, would you believe it? The Mitsubishi in the car park at Boston Airport wasfound to contain a ramp pass allowing access to restricted areas, a copy of theKoran, a fuel consumption calculator and a flight training manual written inArabic on how to fly a 767.104 Wow. What synchronicity. All this was“discovered” at the very time the Bush government was preparing to pin the blameon Arab terrorists working for Osama bin Laden. Shit, thank you God. Just athought, though: maybe a note signed by Osama bin Laden saying “all the bestwith your mass murder on my behalf today by flying those planes into the WorldTrade Center and the Pentagon” might have been a nice touch, just to cover allbases. Perhaps they could have placed the note inside the hijacker’s passportthat was “found” a few blocks from the World Trade Center. Nicely charred at theedges, you know the sort of thing. Add all this to the 757 manuals and “eightinch stack of East Coast flight maps” that were claimed to have been found inhotel rooms rented by some “hijackers” and the story is complete.105 Oh yes, notto forget the reports that al-Shehhi and Atta were spotted in Switzerland thatsummer buying pocket knives and box cutters the day before the FBI says Attaflew from Florida to Spain! “Hey Mohamed, we need box cutters and pocket knives,better fly to Switzerland to buy them, eh?” But one point that occurs to me, notbeing too bright and all, is why an Islamic kamikaze terrorist would havechecked in bags on the plane and left his Koran inside. In fact these guys seemto have left Korans everywhere in bars, cars and baggage. Why would “Muslimfanatics” do this? Better call the FBI, they’ll know. And what they don’tthey’ll make up. Simple.Thy will be doneThe letter and “will” “found” in the baggage of Mohamed Atta that miraculouslydid not make it on to Flight 11 was claimed to include a five-page message tohis fellow hijackers. The FBI says that essentially the same letter was found inthe wreckage of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. “Essentially” the same document? DidAtta, or whoever, hand-write basically the same five-page instruction to everyone of them then? Had he not heard of photocopiers? Attorney General JohnAshcroft also told a “Justice Department” news conference on September 28th thatanother copy of the “letter” had been found at Washington Dulles Airport “in avehicle used by Nawaf al-Hamzi, one of the hijackers on American Airlines Flight77”. The letter, said Ashcroft, “is a disturbing and shocking view into themindset of these terrorists. The letter provides instructions to the terroriststo be carried out both prior to and during their terrorist attacks.” Yeah, yeah.The FBI released “extracts” of the letter “found” in “Atta’s luggage” via theWashington Post on September 28th. It was claimed to be originally written inArabic by someone alleged to be an Islamic fanatic. The full and original Arabictext has not been released by the FBI and nor has the version “found” in thewreckage of Flight 93. “Atta”, or one of his “accomplices”, begins with thesewords: “In the name of God, the most merciful, the most compassionate … In thename of God, of myself, and of my family.” It is claimed to say: “The time offun and waste is gone”…“Be optimistic … Check all your items – your bag, yourclothes, your knives, your will, your IDs, your passport … In the morning, tryto pray the morning prayer with an open heart.” It also tells the “hijackers” to“make sure that nobody is following you.” Blimey, this lot were highly trainedprofessionals weren’t they? Under a heading of “Last Night”, it tells eachhijacker to “remind yourself that in this night you will face many challenges.But you have to face them and understand it 100 per cent … Obey God, hismessenger, and don’t fight among yourself [sic] where [sic] you become weak …Everybody hates death, fears death …” But Muslims, and an excellent article byBritish journalist, Robert Fisk, reveal some major problems with these allegedwords of a “Muslim fanatic”.106 They point out that no Muslim, never mind afanatical one, would include his family in the opening statement of prayer andnor would he ever do it without mentioning the Prophet Mohammed immediatelyafter “God”. The line that “everyone hates death, fears death” is ridiculous. AMuslim, especially one who is prepared to give up his life to the cause, is notsomeone who hates and fears death. This is the moment that they believe they arestarting a new life in paradise. Who writes this stuff? Certainly not a Muslim.As Fisk says in his analysis:> “If the handwritten, five-page document which the FBI says it found in the> baggage of Mohamed Atta, the suicide bomber from Egypt, is genuine, then the> men who murdered more than 7,000 [later said to be about 3,000] innocent> people believed in a very exclusive version of Islam – or were surprisingly> unfamiliar with their religion.”> “… What Muslim would urge his fellow believers to recite the Morning Prayer –> and then go on to quote from it? A devout Muslim would not need to be reminded> of his duty to say the first of the five prayers of the day – and would> certainly not need to be reminded of the text. It is as if a Christian, urging> his followers to recite the Lord’s Prayer, felt it necessary to read the whole> prayer in case they didn’t remember it … Lebanese and Palestinian suicide> bombers have never been known to refer to ‘the time of fun and waste’ –> because a true Muslim would not have ‘wasted’ his time and would regard> pleasure as a reward of the after-life.” 107Here are some of the other instructions for the hijackers in the “letter”:> Pray during the night and be persistent in asking God to give you victory,> control and conquest, and that He may make your task easier and not expose us.> Shouldn’t we take advantage of these last hours to offer good deeds and> obedience? [Nah, let’s just get pissed.]> Bless your body with some verses of the Qur’an (done by reading verses into> one’s hands and then rubbing the hands over whatever is to be blessed), the> luggage, clothes, the knife, your personal effects, your ID, passport, and all> your papers. [Why would they need luggage and why would fanatical Muslims have> to be told how to bless something?]> Check your weapon before you leave and long before you leave.

[Oh> yes, and don’t sleep in so you have to run your arse off to get on the> Portland plane.]> Tighten your clothes, since this is the way of the pious generations after the> Prophet. They would tighten their clothes before battle. Tighten your shoes> well, wear socks so that your feet will be solidly in your shoes. [Didn’t your> mum ever tell you that? Mine neither.]> When the taxi takes you to (M) [we are told this initial could stand for> matar, airport in Arabic, or it could always be McDonald’s, of course]> remember God constantly while in the car. Remember the supplication for> entering a car, for entering a town, the supplication of place and other> supplications. [I think it is more important to remember that the FBI says> these guys went to the airports in cars, not taxis.]> When you have reached (M) and have left the taxi, say a supplication of place> (‘Oh Lord, I ask you for the best of this place, and ask you to protect me> from its evils’), and everywhere you go say that prayer and smile and be calm,> for God is with the believers. [Say a prayer, smile and be calm? I thought> they were supposed to have had an argument with a guy over a car space> immediately they arrived! They ought to listen more.]In his “will” Atta also asks that his body be washed and buried. What, afterflying a plane with 20,000 gallons of fuel into the World Trade Center? Hell ofan embalming job that one. These “documents” are pathetic and should be filedaway under “L” for ludicrous or “P” for pull the other one. In the same fileshould go the hijacker passport “found” in New York, the bin Laden “videoconfession” and all the other juvenile examples of make-believe that the FBI andthe authorities in general have had to put before us to sell their fairytale ofwhat happened, who did it and what the consequences should be. It should also benoted that while they produced this “letter” to the hijackers, which talks ofeveryone fearing death, the FBI also said that 11 of the 19 hijackers named didnot know they were on a suicide mission, but believed themselves to be preparingfor a conventional hijack.108The “pilots” and heeere’s Jackie – againA key strand of the official story is that several of the 19 named by the FBIhad learned to fly at American pilot schools in preparation for hijacking fourcommercial airliners and taking over the controls. They did this, we are told,by practising on single-engine planes and mostly incompetently at that. The maincentre for this flying tuition was the little airport at Venice, a small town inFlorida, not far from Sarasota where Bush visited the school on the morning of9/11. Venice is a seaside resort on the Gulf of Mexico on Florida’ssouth-western coast and known as the “shark tooth capital of the world”. Thecity of Venice has a population of fewer than 30,000 and it’s a retirementcentre, home to the blue rinse-brigade. Venice Airport was mentioned during theIran-Contra hearings when Oliver North was being questioned and the subjectinvolved gun running from the airport to the Contras. Funnily enough, small asVenice may be, our old friend from earlier, Jackson Stephens, has long had apresence there.109 Stephens, you may recall, was an investor in George W. Bush’sHarken Energy together with Khalid bin Mahfouz, the man named by the US StateDepartment as a financial backer of Osama bin Laden. These two have somethingelse in common, too, – their involvement in the BCCI in which the Bush familywas also fundamentally implicated. Stephens is a close friend and financialbacker of Father George and funded Bill Clinton’s campaigns to be governor ofArkansas and US President. He has also been linked by researchers to theNational Security Agency, the major overseer of the US intelligence network andboss to the CIA. Some government officials have accused the NSA of destroyingdata relevant to the 9/11 investigation.110 Stephens was also a roommate ofPresident Jimmy Carter at the US Naval Academy. To put it mildly, this guy hasmassive “connections” and has been named in relation to a number of scandals,including the Whitewater land deals that involved the Clintons, and theIran-Contra gun-running and cocaine smuggling operation through Mena, Arkansas,while Clinton was governor and Bush and Reagan were in the White House. A blockaway from Venice Airport and the “hijacker’s” flying school is the formernational headquarters of the Stephens company, Beverly Enterprises.111 Today itis home to his former law firm, Boone, Boone and Boone, and a Stephens executivestill has an office there.112 Boone, Boone and Boone, it seems, pretty much runthe place. Venice is a “Boone town”, you might say.The FBI says that two flying schools at Venice Airport were attended by all thealleged “hijacker-pilots” who passed through Florida even though the state hassome 200 flying schools to choose from. The Venice schools had both changedhands shortly before Atta and Co arrived there and both were purchased by Dutchnationals. Rudi Dekkers bought Huffman Aviation, and Arne Kruithof fromRotterdam bought the Florida Flight Center. Not long before the “hijackers” weresaid to have arrived at Huffman Aviation, Dekkers launched an aggressiveEuropean ‘marketing’ campaign, as reported in the local paper, the VeniceGondolier at the time. “The world is my working place,” Dekkers told to thepaper. “I won’t forget Venice, but I’m going to market throughout the world,Germany, France, Belgium. That’s our goal, to get people to come in here fromall over the world.” 113 So it proved. Foreign nationals soon made up 80% of thestudent pilots at the school. Hundreds a year were paying thousands of dollarswhile Dekkers, it is reported, was falling behind with the rent.114 DanielHopsicker, author of Barry and the Boys: The CIA, the Mob, and America’s SecretHistory,115 says that Huffman Aviation is one of the schools authorised by theImmigration and Naturalization Service to issue I-20M immigration forms.116These help foreign students to secure US visas as vocational students. Hopsickerquotes an “observer” at Venice Airport as saying of Dekkers:> “I’ve always had some suspicions about the way he breezed into town out of> nowhere. Just too many odd little things. For example, he has absolutely no> aviation background as far as anyone can tell. And he evidently had no use> for, nor knowledge of, FAA rules and regs.” 117Dekkers claimed to have extensive aviation experience, but Richard Boehlke, aformer business associate who fell out with him big time it seems, said: “He wasan oxymoron the day I met him. I can’t believe anyone handed him millions ofdollars to run a business he had no experience in.” 118 Given Boehlke’s businessbackground, however, something very similar might apply to him. Mohamed Atta,who is alleged to have piloted Flight 11, and Marwan al-Shehhi, the man the FBIsays was at the controls of Flight 175, attended Dekkers’ school, we are told.Ziad Jarrah, the alleged pilot of Flight 93 and the guy who was due to marry hisTurkish girlfriend was a student at Kruithof’s operation, the FBI claims.However, reports in the national and local media reveal a familiar trend in the9/11 “story”. Different people tell a different tale about the same events andpersonalities. Ivan Chirivella was an instructor at Jones Aviation FlyingService Inc. at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, which is just half anhour from Venice and five miles or so from the Emma E. Booker Elementary Schoolwhere President Bush was on the morning of September 11th. Chirivella toldAssociated Press that Atta and al-Shehhi went to his school in September orOctober 2000 and asked for flying instruction.119 He said they came to him fromHuffman Aviation and he claimed to have given them lessons virtually everymorning in that period. Dekkers, however, says they were with his school betweenlate July and December or January, paying, according to Dekkers, $20,000 each.They are remembered for stalling a Piper Warrior on a Miami area runway and thenabandoning the aircraft, walking across another active runway, and makingcontrollers in the tower furious, it is reported.120We are told that Atta and al-Shehhi rented a room for a short time in the houseowned by Charlie Voss, a former Huffman Aviation employee, in Venice. Vossapparently is also a former C130 pilot with the US military, according toresearcher Daniel Hopsicker.121 Voss said they hardly spoke and left their rooma mess. He asked them to leave after a few days, Voss told reporters. One of theHuffman Aviation instructors told the media he had taught Atta and al-Shehhi ina single-engine Cessna 172. This was “Mark Mickart”, whose real name is MarkWierdak.122 Daniel Hopsicker says he traced a half-sister of Mickart/Wierdak whoworks for the British Consulate in Venezuela. She told them that she and Wierdak“… used to share the same father”. Hopsicker says he established thatMickart/Wierdak also flies out of the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport for AgapeFlights. This is a Christian missionary group who call themselves an independentministry fighting disease, poverty and illiteracy. For more than 20 years theyhave been running a flight every week to and from the Dominican Republic in theCaribbean, Hopsicker says he established. Florida is a major centre of drugtrafficking and CIA, Mafia, and military activity, all of which so often gotogether. I have seen the Saudi royal family mentioned for its connection to theFlorida elite and criminal networks. Hopsicker says that the son of Alvin Malnikof the Miami Mafia is married into the Saudi royal family through a daughter ofa Saudi prince. The king of Saudi Arabia would regularly send his private 747 toFlorida to allow Malnik and gang to do business with the Saudis away from publicview, Hopsicker reports.123Trained by the United States?Florida is also home to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, where the USmilitary operates exchange programmes for overseas officers. Within days ofSeptember 11th there were reports in Newsweek, the Washington Post, and theKnight Ridder newspapers, that five of the hijackers named by the FBI weretrained at secure US bases in the 1990s, including three at Pensacola. Newsweekquoted a “high-ranking US Navy source” as saying that three of the allegedhijackers listed Pensacola Naval Air Station as their address on driver’slicences and car registrations.124 The report said these men were believed to beSaeed al-Ghamdi and Ahmad al-Nami, who were allegedly on Flight 93, and Ahmedal-Ghamdi, who is alleged to have hijacked Flight 175. Al-Ghamdi and al-Nami areapparently both still alive. It is claimed that their training at Pensacola waspaid for by Saudi Arabia, the ally of the United States, and associates andclients of the Carlyle Group. Newsweek claimed that military records showed thatthe three used the address of 10 Radford Boulevard, a base roadway where theresidences of foreign-military flight trainees are located. In March 1997, Saeedal-Ghamdi listed the address to register a 1998 Oldsmobile, Newsweek said, andfive months later used it to register a late-model Buick. The report says thatdriving licences were believed to have been issued to the other two suspects in1996 and 1998, and also list the barracks as their residences. An FBI spokesmanis quoted as saying the hijackers could have stolen the identities of people whotrained at the bases. Mohamed Atta was reported by Newsweek to have attended theMaxwell AFB in Montgomery, Alabama.125 In response to the Newsweek report, theFlorida Democrat Senator Bill Nelson faxed a request to Attorney General JohnAshcroft demanding confirmation or otherwise of this story. A spokesman for thesenator said:> “In the wake of those reports we asked about the Pensacola Naval Air Station> but we never got a definitive answer from the Justice Department. So we asked> the FBI for an answer if and when they could provide us one. Their response to> date [five months later] has been that they are trying to sort through> something complicated and difficult.” 126A Pentagon spokesman responded on September 16th by saying that “name matchesmay not necessarily mean the students were the hijackers, and that discrepanciesin biographical data indicate, “We are probably not talking about the samepeople.” 127 “May not necessarily?” “Probably”? You mean they don’t know? Ofcourse they do, and so why don’t they simply point out the background to thoseforeign trainees with, coincidentally, the same names as those claimed to behijackers? But they won’t do that. A Pentagon spokesman, for example, deniedthat the Mohamed Atta who attended the International Officer’s School is thesame man who is claimed to have been the leader of the hijackers. Yet he refusedall requests for the biographical background of the Mohamed Atta at the school.The spokesman told reporters: “I do not have the authority to tell you who[which hijackers] attended which schools.” Did some of the alleged hijackers,including Atta, attend military training schools in the United States?128 Iasked the FBI this question, but officials refused to answer. Daniel Hopsicker,who has written extensively on the Florida flying schools and the military-CIAconnection, said: “We know of at least one woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who hascredibly insisted to local reporters that she met Atta at a party on the base.She remembers because she then introduced him to her friends.” He writes that hewas told that Arab pilots, mostly Saudis, occupied most of one of the most eliteupscale apartment complexes in Montgomery.129 The Los Angeles Times also quoteda “defense official” as saying that two of the hijackers were former Saudifighter pilots who had attended two prominent US military programmes, theDefense Language School at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and the Air Force’sAir War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.130 Also, in Taif, SaudiArabia, the last known location of the bin Laden-funding Khalid bin Mahfouz, theUnited States Military Training Mission operates a joint training mission underthe command of United States Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base inFlorida. Could some of these guys have been trained by the United States? Itcertainly wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. Michael Springman, theformer head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah from 1987 to 1989, told theBBC Newsnight programme:> “In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high level State Department> officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants. These were, essentially,> people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country. I> complained bitterly at the time there. I returned to the US, I complained to> the State Department here, to the General Accounting Office, to the Bureau of> Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General’s office. I was met with> silence.” 131The BBC also quoted “a highly placed source in a US intelligence agency” assaying there had always been “constraints” on investigating Saudis and thatunder President George W. Bush it had become much worse.132 It is worth notingthat the Kennedy assassination was blamed on a US-trained CIA operative calledLee Harvey Oswald. The Oklahoma bombing patsy was a highly trained US soldier(and what else?), Timothy McVeigh, together with Iraqi Republican Guard officerswho were relocated to the United States, and Oklahoma in particular, by FatherGeorge Bush after the Gulf War. Al Martin, a retired Navy Lt. Commander, saysthat one of the Iranians involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in1993 was trained at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, and completedan explosives course in the guise of a Pakistani officer. Not just anyone canqualify to attend these US military training schools. You need connections withforeign governments “friendly” with the United States. In other words,governments in league with the Illuminati elements that control the UnitedStates. If Atta did not have this high-level backing, he could not have gainedadmission to the Maxwell AFB training school. If we look at an example of aforeign student who qualified for US military training you can see the sort ofbackground we are looking at here. Colonel Mohammed Ahmed Hamel al Qubaisibecame a Defense Military Naval and Air Attaché at the United Arab EmiratesEmbassy in Washington DC and was previously Chief of Intelligence in the Embassyand Security Division and in the Security Division-Air Force Intelligence andSecurity Directorate Security Officer-Air Force Intelligence and SecurityDirectorate.133 This is no squaddie, foot soldier or guy off the street. Norcould Atta have been if he did attend such a school at Maxwell. In the Newsweekarticle, a former Navy pilot at the Pensacola base in Florida was quoted assaying:> “We always, always, always trained other countries’ pilots. When I was there> two decades ago, it was Iranians. The Shah was in power. Whoever the country> du jour is, that’s whose pilots we train.”134The American military’s country of choice for such trainees in the 1990s turnsout to be … Saudi Arabia. Well, well, hello again. Almost from the start of thisbook Saudi Arabia has been a constant theme, together with the Bush family.Father George’s Carlyle Group are “advisers” to the Saudi royal family andcontrol them, according to insiders. James Baker of the Carlyle Group also has abase in Saudi Arabia for his law firm, Baker and Botts, legal advisers to theBushes. The bin Laden family, investors in the Carlyle Group and Boy George’sArbusto Energy, are based in Saudi Arabia and at least 11 members of thatfamily, some report many more, were allowed to fly home from Boston Airportimmediately after September 11th. Then there are those other Bush familyinvestors who have been named as financial backers of the Osama bin Ladennetwork, our old friends, Mohamed Hussein Al-Amoudi and Khalid bin Mahfouz. Thelatter was a major player in the BCCI, the drug money laundering operation and afront for intelligence agency manipulation, including the CIA funding of Osamabin Laden. Another BCCI player was Jackson Stephens who apparently has a likingfor the little town of Venice where the flight schools are located that aresupposed to have “trained” Atta and company. The overwhelming majority of thosenamed as “hijackers” by the FBI were Saudi nationals. Even Atta, an Egyptian,was reported to have a Saudi passport. To put the cherry on the cake, men of thesame name as some alleged hijackers, including Atta, attended US militarytraining schools at secure bases in the 1990s at the very time when Saudi Arabiawas the country of choice for such training. Oh, and people do not qualify forsuch training unless they are well connected or supported by high levels ofauthority in the country they are representing, in this case … Saudi Arabia.The Newsweek article quotes a “Pentagon source” as saying that at least two ofthose trained were former Saudi Air Force pilots. Apparently, some of the“hijackers” had pilot’s licenses connecting them to the Saudi Arabian nationalairline, which is owned by the government of Saudi Arabia. Were the formerlyGerman-based Mohamed Atta and some of his alleged colleagues assets of the CIAor the CIA-associated German intelligence, British intelligence and Mossad?Former German Defence Secretary Andreas von Bulow told me that the CIA, Germanintelligence, and Mossad, were extremely closely connected and the samecertainly goes for British intelligence. Were Atta and company knowingly orunknowingly constructing the cover story, but never boarded the planes? Werethey set up to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Are these stories of the“hijackers” trained at US military establishments simply a diversion? Any ofthese situations is possible. In fact, the story that is truly impossible is theone told by the FBI and the US government. Terrorist patsies and stooges arefrequently set up by the intelligence agency network, which then protects itsown operatives from exposure. The FBI assistant director James Fox named the manresponsible for planting the explosives in the 1993 bombing of the World TradeCenter as Mohammed Salameh, a follower of a CIA asset called Omar Abdel Rahman.It was claimed that Salameh left the bomb in a rented Ford Econoline van. Butthe International Herald Tribune reported that the telephone number andapartment listed on the rental agreement for the van belonged to Josie Hadas, along-established Mossad operative.135 The Washington Post revealed: “A search ofthe Hadas apartment Thursday afternoon had discovered among other things, aletter addressed to the defendant [Salameh], tools and wiring, and manualsconcerning antennae, circuitry and electromagnetic devices.” The Post said theFBI had concluded that this constituted evidence of a bomb maker at thelocation. So why was Josie Hadas, Mossad operative, not arrested? Whateverhappened to him? Salameh rented the Ford Econoline, but reported it stolen tothe police before the bombing, and even returned to the rental company to handover police documents detailing the reported theft and asked for his $400deposit to be returned. Salameh was clearly set up and something very similarhappened when the World Trade Center was attacked again in 2001.Larry Johnson, the former deputy director of the State Department’s office oncounterterrorism, told Fox News that the paths of alleged hijackers Mohamed Attaand Marwan Al-Shehhi, and alleged accomplice, Zacarias Moussaoui, had crossed onmore than one occasion with that of Al-Hussaini Hussain, the man Johnsonbelieves was the John Doe 2 with McVeigh outside the Murrah Building inOklahoma.136 He is not alone in this belief. Johnson said that the motel inOklahoma City where the Murrah bombing is said to have been planned was visitedby Atta, al-Shehhi and Moussaoui five weeks before 9/11. Johnson said:> “I’ve spoken to the owner of the motel. After the 9/11 attacks he called the> FBI, the FBI came out and interviewed him – and he identified Mohamed Atta,> Marwan Al-Shehhi and Zacarias Moussaoui.”Al-Hussaini Hussain was one of Saddam Hussein’s Republican Guard officers whowere relocated to the United States, especially Oklahoma, by Father George Bushafter the Gulf War and some of these people have also been connected byresearchers to the World Trade Center bombing of 1993, which strongly appears tohave involved Mossad operative, Jose Hadas. Johnson says that after leavingOklahoma, Al-Hussaini Hussain secured a job at Boston Logan Airport whereFlights 11 and 175 departed before being flown into the World Trade Center by,it is claimed, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi. It is possible that Atta,al-Shehhi and a few of the others could have been intelligence assets who didnot know the true picture, but I think most of those on the FBI list are fakeidentities used to hide what really happened. I believe their role was inconstructing the cover story, knowingly or unknowingly. Clearly this is true ofmany of those named by the FBI because they are still alive. We should keep inmind the technique of compartmentalisation in which different groups and peoplewithin these intelligence networks have no idea what other groups and people inthe same network are doing, or what the big picture might be. They only knowwhat they need to know to do their jobs. I’ll come back to possible scenarios ina later chapter.Why not Indian Point?Here’s another puzzling question if you buy the “Arab terrorists hated Americansand wanted to destroy the infidels in the home of Satan” story. Why did Flight11 fly almost directly over the massive nuclear power installations at IndianPoint, around 24 miles from New York City, and why did Flight 175 fly past onlya few minutes away? Why didn’t they both target Indian Point and have thepotential to turn that whole region of the United States, including New York,into an uninhabitable wasteland and in the process kill millions of “infidels”through radiation poisoning in the months and years to come? There are threenuclear plants at Indian Point, two of them active apparently, and apart fromthe power stations themselves the complex has an enormous store of radioactivewaste. Why fly over this nuclear complex on the way to New York when devastationbeyond belief would have been caused by aiming the two planes at Indian Point?But, of course, the question again answers itself. Attacking the World TradeCenter does not affect the elite that control the United States, except inpositively advancing their agenda. Targeting Indian Point would mean that theheadquarters and lives of the US elite would also be threatened andfundamentally affected. See how these “hijackers” were so understanding andaware of the needs of the very US elite they were supposed to hate? They showedthe same consideration when they targeted the side of the Pentagon that wasfurthest away from the offices of the Defense Secretary, the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, and the other leaders of the US military. So kind, so thoughtful. Notonly that, these highly professional hijackers directed the plane at the verysection of the building that had just undergone rebuilding and reinforcement toprotect it against terrorist attack! Or, as CBS put it on November 28th, 2001:“In an astonishing stroke of luck, the terrorists had hit the only section ofthe Pentagon designed to resist a terrorist attack.” Hey Abdul, you sure thismap is the right way up?Expert scepticismAndreas von Bulow, the former German Minister of Defence and Minister forResearch and Technology in the government of German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt,told the German daily newspaper Der Tagesspiegel that the official story ofSeptember 11th was nonsense.137 During official government investigations helearned about the methods of German and American intelligence and securityagencies, and he wrote a book on the subject, Im Namen des Staates (In the Nameof the State). He says that 95% of the work of intelligence agencies isdeception and disinformation communicated through the mass media to create an“acceptable ‘virtual’ version of events”.138 Von Bulow told Der Tagesspiegelthat the planning of the 9/11 attacks was technically and organisationally amaster achievement. To hijack four huge airplanes within a few minutes and,within one hour, to drive them into their targets, with complicated flightmanoeuvres, was unthinkable, he said, without years of support from “secretapparatuses of the state and industry”. He said there are 26 intelligenceservices in the United States with a budget of $30 billion – more than theGerman defence budget – and yet they were not able to prevent the attacks and“for 60 decisive minutes the military and intelligence services let fighterplanes stay on the ground”. But within 48 hours, he said, the FBI had presenteda list of suicide attackers, seven of which turned out to be alive. He went on:> “If this Atta was the decisive man in the operation, it’s really strange that> he took such a risk of taking a plane that would reach Boston such a short> time before the connecting flight. Had his flight been a few minutes late, he> would not have been in the plane that was hijacked. Why should a sophisticated> terrorist do this? One can, by the way, read on CNN (Internet) that none of> these names were on the official passenger lists. None of them had gone> through the check-in procedures. And why did none of the threatened pilots> give the agreed-upon code 7700 over the transponder to the ground station?> “In addition: The black boxes which are fire and shock proof, as well as the> voice recordings, contain no valuable data … [and] … assailants … in their> preparations, leave tracks behind them like a herd of stampeding elephants.> They made payments with credit cards with their own names; they reported to> their flight instructors with their own names. They left behind rented cars> with flight manuals in Arabic … They took with them, on their suicide trip,> wills and farewell letters, which fall into the hands of the FBI, because they> were stored in the wrong place and wrongly addressed. Clues were left behind> like in a child’s game of hide-and-seek, which were to be followed!” 139Eckehardt Werthebach, the former chief of German domestic intelligence, agreeswith this assessment. He told the American Free Press that the magnitude of theplanning and the “deathly precision” could not have been achieved withoutsupport from a state intelligence organisation. The lack of prior warning wouldalso indicate such an involvement, he said.140 Horst Ehmke, the man whosupervised German intelligence in the 1970s, says the same – an intelligenceorganisation had to be involved. He said the events of September 11th lookedlike a “Hollywood production”.141“Evidence” to die forIt is staggering to think that at least 5,000 Afghan civilians died in just thefirst phase of the “war on terrorism” when the only justification for this massmurder was the “evidence” outlined here for who was responsible for the attacksof September 11th. The authorities named a group of “hijackers” overwhelminglydominated by Saudis with not a single Afghan on the list. The FBI’s “list” of“hijackers” was utterly discredited with at least seven, possibly more, of the19 named found to be still alive. The passenger lists as issued by the twoairlines do not include the names of the “hijackers” or anyone with an Arab nameand the seat numbers for them given by two flight attendants on Flight 11 and bythe FBI do not match. There are no cameras in the Boston Airport departurelounge to prove that Atta and his alleged accomplices even got on the planes. Iwas denied access to the American and United Airlines check-in staff on dutythat day to confirm that they remembered checking them in. Video footage showingthe alleged hijackers boarding at Newark, New Jersey and Washington Dulles,where they do have surveillance cameras, has not been made public when it wouldadd substance to the official story’s collapsing credibility. Why don’t theyrelease them if they really exist when they have long released the pictures fromPortland, Maine? Why have we not seen footage of the “Middle Eastern men” in thecar park at Boston Airport where they have surveillance cameras recording thecomings and goings? Despite this complete lack of evidence and with FBI chiefRobert Mueller saying they have “no legal proof to prove the identities of thesuicidal hijackers”, Bush and Blair stampeded the world into a war that hasalready killed thousands of civilians and will go on to kill millions unlessthese lunatics are stopped. How can you blame the attacks on Osama bin Ladenwhen you can’t even say who the hijackers were, never mind link them to binLaden, which, even with their spectacularly discredited “list”, they havedemonstrably failed to do?There are ridiculous contradictions between the pilot skills required tomanoeuvre and navigate those planes to find and strike those buildings, and thereports from flying instructors of the limited, often non-existent, abilities ofthose claimed to have been hijacker-pilots. One effort to overcome this has beenthe story of how Atta and al-Shehhi practiced on a Boeing 727 simulator atSimCenter Inc. in Opa-locka, near Miami, owned by Henry R. George. He said thetwo men had spent three hours each in the school’s 727 jet simulator on December29th and 30th 2000. “They did not seem to have enough skill to pilot real jetairliners, although they had sufficient skills to turn and drive an airplane,”George said.142 They spent most of their time practising manoeuvres and turns,he said, but they did take off and land on the simulator as well. It was not aformal training programme for flying jets, George pointed out, and it was “amini, mini introduction”.143 What about the claims that they were highly trainedpilots who carried out the 9/11 attacks? Note that he says they practised takeoffs and landings while the media only emphasised that they wanted to practiseturns because it fitted with the government’s story. George also added: “To me,they acted like normal human beings, nothing abnormal. They were polite, maybeeven shy.” 144 The FBI says that Hani Hanjour joined the Sawyer School ofAviation flight simulator club in Phoenix, which gives members unlimited use ofa flight simulator, and yet his flying ability was so limited according toinstructors at the schools he attended that even the FBI had to withdraw theclaims that he was flying Flight 77 when it is said to have struck the Pentagon.One other question: if these men who attended US flying schools were part of theal-Qaeda network that has, we are told, unlimited funds and a fantastic globalweb of contacts, operatives, and supporters, why did they take the risk oflearning to fly (or not as it turned out) in the United States before September11th? Why not learn at a safe location somewhere else in the world under thetutelage of flying instructors who were part of their network?If you have evidence to prove that your story is true then you have no need toinvent “evidence” like passports miraculously falling from fireballs and Islamic“letters” that any Muslim can see were not written by followers, never mindfanatics, of their religion. If what you say is correct, you don’t preventwitnesses being interviewed, you release videotapes to back up your claims, youanswer basic questions, and you don’t keep contracting yourself day after day.You do all of those things only when you don’t have evidence and when you areseeking to mislead. The official story does not make sense, none of it adds up,and for a very good reason. It’s not true.> Postscript:> During the first print run of this book the FBI said that the “hijacker> passport” story it had called a news conference to reveal was now a “rumour> that might be true”.

knowledge Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pauseand reflectMark TwainMany questions remain about what happened on September 11th, but there is muchthat we do already know. We know that the Bush family has business and otherassociations with the bin Laden family. We know that President Boy George Bushordered the FBI to back off investigations into the bin Laden family’sinvolvement in funding the al-Qaeda network and other terrorist groups. We knowthat at least 11 members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out ofAmerica from Boston Logan days after 9/11 at a time when everyone else with anArab face in America was considered a suspect. We know that only months beforeSeptember 11th John O’Neill resigned as deputy director of the FBI and head ofcounter-terrorism because he was not allowed to investigate the bin Ladennetwork. We know that Father George Bush has made visits to the bin Ladens inSaudi Arabia and has been an adviser to the family business. We know that Bushfamily members are business associates of people like Khalid bin Mahfouz who hasbeen named by the US State Department as a funder of Osama bin Laden. We knowthat Father George arranged for thousands of officers and troops from SaddamHussein’s Republican Guard to settle in the United States after the Gulf War,most of them in Oklahoma. We know that reporters have linked some of thesepeople to the Oklahoma bombing and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.As I will outline later, we know that the invasion of Afghanistan was beingplanned long before September 11th and that the bombing of a stone-age countryin the middle of a famine had nothing to do with 9/11 – except that it providedthe public excuse. We know that the removal of the Taliban has opened the wayfor the crucial oil and gas pipelines the Bush family and their Illuminatiassociates are desperate to build to open the floodgates to the Caspian Seareserves they have long coveted. We know that the bin Laden network inAfghanistan was funded into existence by the CIA and that the tunnel systemsbombed by US and British forces were paid for by the CIA and built by the binLaden family construction empire, as I will highlight in a later chapter. Weknow that the lack of response to the 9/11 attacks that morning was utterlybizarre, as was the behaviour of the top three commanders of the US military,Bush, Rumsfeld and Myers. We know that in the months before September 11th Bushwas given many warnings about possible attacks on the American mainland usingcommercial aircraft, but nothing was done. We know that the official story isintelligence-insulting nonsense and that the attacks have massively advanced thevery Illuminati agenda for a centralised, militarised, fascist state that I andothers have been warning about for so long.Air Force insider says Bush knewLieutenant Colonel Steve Butler, a US Air Force veteran and vice chancellor forstudent affairs at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, saidthat Bush knew the 9/11 attacks were coming, but did nothing. Butler sent aletter setting out his claims to the Monterey County Herald and it was publishedon May 26th 2002. “Of course Bush knew about the impending attacks on America,”Butler said in the letter. “He did nothing to warn the American people becausehe needed this war on terrorism.” Butler is a former combat pilot who took partin the Gulf War in 1991, and he said that Boy George was using Osama bin Ladenin the same way that his father used Saddam Hussein and Iraq. After the letterappeared, Butler was relieved of his duties at the language school and assignedto temporary duty at Travis Air Force Base pending an investigation into hisconduct. I understand that Butler is not just making wild allegations, but hasdefinite knowledge that Bush and the Pentagon were well aware that the attackswere coming and when. Butler’s assertions are supported by a stream of otherevidence and I’m not surprised they wanted to shut him up fast.Bush “warned” of attacksIt is indicative of where you find the real investigative journalism that monthsbefore the mainstream media published the story, Internet websites weredetailing the reports that President Bush was told of possible hijackings in theUnited States before September 11th and did nothing to warn people. Before Idetail some of this background, however, a warning of my own. We need to becareful about the double-spin technique or what I call “the fallback position”.When these Illuminati operations are played out there is always a number onecover story that they want the people to believe – and most do. In this case itis that Osama bin Laden organised the entire operation with “his” al-Qaedanetwork and it was so brilliantly done that the US agencies had no idea what wasgoing on until the planes crashed. But they know that not everyone will believethat and will look for some kind of conspiracy behind the official version. Sothey give them one to keep them happy and occupied. When Princess Diana wasassassinated in Paris in 1997 the number one cover story was that it was all aterrible accident caused by a drunk driver. The fallback position was that shewas murdered because the British royal family did not want her to marry aMuslim, Dodi Fayed. Both stories are untrue, but together they providealternative explanations accepted by the vast majority of people. The 9/11 fallback position for conspiracy researchers and others who question the officialline is that (a) the Bush administration knew the attacks were coming, but wereso incompetent that they did nothing or (b) the Bush administration knew theattacks were coming, but did nothing because allowing them to happen would givethem the excuse to launch a war on terrorism for reasons of oil and advancingtheir fascist agenda. What these two versions and the number one cover story allhave in common is very significant: no matter what the background detail mightbe, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were responsible for organising the whole thingand the plan involved “terrorists” trained at US flying schools. This suits theIlluminati because it hides the most important truth, I would suggest, that thecore organisation behind the attacks was not based in a cave in Afghanistan, butin the headquarters of the US government, intelligence “community”, themilitary, and at the highest level of the Illuminati hierarchy. I would advisethat we keep that in mind when we hear the stories that “Bush was warned”.Incompetence is often used as a screen to cover up calculated involvement, andthis “incompetence” can be used, as in this case, to justify the“reorganisation” (centralisation) of intelligence and security agencies to putthe power in even fewer hands. Yes Bush was warned, but it was more than that,much, much, more.In May 2002 the story broke widely in the mainstream media (big red flag) of thenumber of warnings given to, and circulating within, the Bush administration andits agencies. The White House admitted eight months after the attacks that Bushwas told by US intelligence before September 11th that Osama bin Laden’sterrorist network might hijack American airplanes, we are told. The White Housepress secretary Ari Fleischer said the administration notified the “appropriateagencies” in the summer of 2001 that hijackings were possible, but the Massportorganisation that runs Boston Logan Airport told the Boston Globe it was toldnothing about this.1 Fleischer would not say when or how Bush was given theinformation, but it emerged that it was during an intelligence briefing onAugust 6th 2001 – or so we’re told. These are the same US intelligence agenciesthat said they had no idea that the September 11th attacks were being planned.The CIA would only say in response to these reports that the subject of airlinehijackings was among a number of terrorist methods raised to US governmentofficials at the time. In fact, Congressional correspondent David Welna said onNational Public Radio on the morning of September 11th: “I spoke withCongressman Ike Skelton – a Democrat fromMissouri and a member of the Armed Services Committee – who said that justrecently the Director of the CIA warned that there could be an attack, animminent attack, on the United States of this nature. So this is not entirelyunexpected.” 2Federal ban on investigation (FBI)It was also reported that a classified memo written by an FBI agent in Phoenixat that same time urged FBI headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern menenrolled in American flight schools and said that terrorist groups like the binLaden group could be sending students to the schools as part of terrorist plans.Law enforcement officials said the memo was received at bureau headquarters inlate July and was reviewed by counterterrorism staff. But no action was taken inresponse to the memo’s urgings to compile information on the visa applicationsof foreign students seeking admission to aviation schools. On August 17th aflight instructor at the Pan Am Flying Academy in Eagan, Minnesota, called thelocal FBI office to report his suspicions about a 33-year-old French-Moroccancalled Zacarias Moussaoui, who was later charged with being involved. But theNew York Times reported that senior FBI officials repeatedly denied requests byagents at the Minnesota office for a detailed investigation into hisbackground.3 One of the facts that interested the agents was that Moussaoui wasattending flying schools and yet since 9/11 the FBI Director Robert Mueller hasconstantly claimed the FBI had no idea that potential terrorists were trainingto be pilots in the US. He said it was “news, quite obviously,” and added: “Ifwe had understood that to be the case, we would have – perhaps one could haveaverted this.” This is clearly another monumental lie, but I stress again thatwe need to be very careful that these stories are not circulating to underpinthe “hijackers attending flying schools did it” scenario. For me the agents werein danger of thwarting the cover story rather than exposing the real plot andthat’s why their efforts were blocked. Information from FBI agents in Minnesotawas included in an internal FBI document warning that Moussaoui “might beplanning on flying something into the World Trade Center”.4 The agents asked fora warrant to search Moussaoui’s personal computer, but these were refused by theJustice Department of Bush Attorney General John Ashcroft. Coleen Rowley, an FBIagent for more than 21 years and Minneapolis Chief Division Counsel, sent a memoin May 2002 to FBI Director Robert Mueller condemning the way the bureauheadquarters had blocked terrorist investigations before 9/11. She said thatcertain facts about this had been “omitted, downplayed, glossed over and/ormis-characterised in an effort to avoid or minimise personal and/orinstitutional embarrassment on the part of the FBI and/or perhaps even forimproper political reasons.” She went on:> “In the day or two following September 11th, you, Director Mueller, made the> statement to the effect that if the FBI had only had any advance warning of> the attacks, we (meaning the FBI), may have been able to take some action to> prevent the tragedy. Fearing that this statement could easily come back to> haunt the FBI upon revelation of the information that had been developed> pre-September 11th about Moussaoui, I and others in the Minneapolis Office,> immediately sought to reach your office through an assortment of higher level> FBIHQ contacts, in order to quickly make you aware of the background of the> Moussaoui investigation and forewarn you so that your public statements could> be accordingly modified.> “When such statements from you and other FBI officials continued, we thought> that somehow you had not received the message and we made further efforts.> Finally when similar comments were made weeks later, in Assistant Director> Caruso’s congressional testimony in response to the first public leaks about> Moussaoui we faced the sad realization that the remarks indicated someone,> possibly with your approval, had decided to circle the wagons at FBIHQ in an> apparent effort to protect the FBI from embarrassment and the relevant FBI> officials from scrutiny. Everything I have seen and heard about the FBI’s> official stance and the FBI’s internal preparations in anticipation of further> congressional inquiry, had, unfortunately, confirmed my worst suspicions in> this regard.” 5In straightforward terms, Mueller was knowingly lying and allowing hisassociates to lie. Rowley revealed how “in a desperate 11th hour measure tobypass the “FBIHQ roadblock” the Minneapolis Division directly notified theCIA’s Counter Terrorist Center, but FBI headquarters “chastised” the Minneapolisagents for making the direct notification without their approval! Rowley toldMueller that in the early aftermath of September 11th when she was recountingthe pre-September 11th events concerning the Moussaoui investigation to otherFBI personnel in other divisions or FBI headquarters, “almost everyone’s firstquestion was ‘Why? –Why would an FBI agent(s) deliberately sabotage a case?’” Ifthey would care to read this book they might see the answer to that question andthe fact that it was so widely asked shows how the compartmentalisation works soeffectively. FBI Special Agent Robert Wright, Jr, who investigated thelaundering of money for terrorism in the United States for four years, wasequally livid at how his efforts were blocked by superiors. He told the media onMay 30th 2002:> “I truly believe I would be derelict in my duty as an American if I did not do> my best to bring the FBI’s dereliction of duty to the attention of others. I> have made it my mission … to legally expose the problems of the FBI to the> President of the United States, the US Congress, and the American people.” 6FBI agents were so angry at the way they were blocked by their own superiorsthat they gave their information to Chicago lawyer David Schippers, the man wholed the legal efforts to impeach President Clinton. Schippers said he contactedthe office of Attorney General John Ashcroft to urge an investigation, but hispleas were ignored. Schippers says he was given information by FBI agents andintelligence sources that a massive terrorist attack was being planned for lowerManhattan and he had tried in vain for six weeks to communicate this informationto Ashcroft. He said he had also tried in the past to tell Ashcroft about theconnection between the Oklahoma bombing and the Iraqi officers and soldiers thatwere brought to Oklahoma after the Gulf War by Father George Bush, but got thesame response.7 He said of the Iraqi officers: “The word is out even today thatthe Oklahoma City police are not allowed to touch them.” Schippers described hisefforts to warn Ashcroft:> “I was trying to get people to understand that [the terrorist group] Hamas had> infiltrated the United States. I tried the House, I tried the Senate, I tried> the Department of Justice, these were the very people who put up roadblocks on> the attack against the terrorists under Clinton and are still there. They> still constitute almost like a moat between the people with information and> the people who should hear the information.> “I used people who were personal friends of John Ashcroft to try and get him.> One of them called me back and said right I’ve talked to him, he’ll call you> tomorrow morning. This was like a month before the bombing [9/11 attacks].> “The next day I got a call from a lower ranked official of the Justice> Department who said they don’t start their investigations at the top. He would> look into my information and get back to me. He never did.” 8Stansfield Turner, a former head of the CIA, said on US television that the FBIhad been closely following up to six bin Laden “cells” in the months before 9/11and had tapped every phone line and computer communication. The FBI could notmove in, he said, because the men had not done anything illegal.9 The FBI andCIA were not aware of what was going on? Sure. How come an Urban Search andRescue Team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a massiveIlluminati front, was deployed to New York City the night before the attacks. OnSeptember 11th, Tom Kennedy, a FEMA official, told Dan Rather on CBS News:“We’re currently one of the first teams that was deployed to support the City ofNew York in this disaster. We arrived on late Monday night and went right intoaction on Tuesday morning.” 10 Now I have heard of being clairvoyant, but …?? Aslong ago as December 1996 the German paper Die Welt and Agence France Pressereported that the CIA and other intelligence agencies had learned of plans tocrash commercial airliners into the twin towers. The reports claimed that theinformation was found on the computer of al-Qaeda operatives arrested in thePhilippines. The plan, called “Operation Bojinka”, was also revealed in 1997during the trial in New York of Ramsi Youssef who was jailed for his part in the1993 World Trade Center bombing (with enormous help from the FBI). Other sourcesfor warnings of the attacks are claimed to include the following:> The German Intelligence agency BND warned both the CIA and Israel in June that> Middle Eastern terrorists were “planning to hijack commercial aircraft to use> as weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli culture.” The> story referred to an electronic eavesdropping system called Echelon that is> used by US-connected countries to tap cellphone and electronic communications,> and the information shared with each other. The BND warnings were also passed> to the United Kingdom, it is reported.11> Russia’s President Putin said that before September 11th he had ordered> Russian intelligence to warn the US government “in the strongest possible> terms” of imminent assaults on airports and government buildings.12> The German newspaper Neue Presse reported how a 29-year-old Iranian held in> custody in Hanover warned US intelligence officials of an attack planned in> America the week of September 10th.

He also tried to deflectthese headlines by saying that “Without a doubt, a very real threat of anotherperhaps more devastating attack still exists.” You should know, Dick. Just asthe questions were being asked about what the president knew and when, it wasannounced with perfect timing that an American citizen had been arrested withoutcharge for plotting a “dirty bomb” attack in the United States. A “dirty bomb”is made of conventional explosives, but contains radioactive material. DonnaNewman, the lawyer of Abdullah al-Muhajir, formerly Jose Padilla, called thegovernment case “weak” and filed a petition challenging the legal basis forclassifying her client as an “enemy combatant” – a term that allows hisindefinite detention without trial. Bush in typical style said: “This guy,Padilla, is a bad guy and he is where he needs to be detained.” Such is theworld we live in since September 11th.It happened before at the WTCIt is obvious that many people knew to a larger or lesser extent that theattacks were coming, and for the FBI and CIA to claim they had no warning is toinsult the mind of a five year old. The fact is that all this has happenedbefore. The New York Times revealed how the FBI had the chance to stop thecarnage in the bombing of the World Trade Center on February 26th 1993, butfailed to do so. The Times published conversations secretly recorded by FBIinformer Emad Ali Salem, a one-time Egyptian army officer, which show how theFBI knew the attack was coming and planned to substitute the explosives in thetruck bomb for harmless powder. But Salem said an FBI supervisor called JohnAnticev stopped the plan, and six people died and 1,000 were injured. Emad AliSalem says on the tape: “Guys, now you saw this bomb went off and you both knowwe could avoid that.” 13 He said that the FBI agents were paid to “preventproblems like this from happening” and in a conversation with an agent Floyd,Salem says to him: “Do you deny your supervisor is the main reason of bombingthe World Trade Center?” Salem said Mr Anticev did not deny it. “We was handlingthe case perfectly well until the supervisor messed it up, upside down,” Salemsays.14 So Salem, an FBI informant, built the bomb that exploded at the WorldTrade Center; he was paid a million dollars by the bureau; and he was under thewitness protection programme when he was the chief prosecution witness in thetrial of those blamed by the FBI! Ron Kuby, an attorney for one of thedefendants, said of the article revealing the tapes:> “The article on the FBI being involved in the World Trade Center bombing> actually understated the evidence, believe it or not. The informer, Emad> Salem, is actually on tape saying that he built the bomb that ultimately blew> up the World Trade Center … In addition, we have received information that he> was visually observed at the scene of the bombing shortly after the bombing> took place. Shortly after that, he was admitted to the hospital, suffering> from an ear problem that was consistent with exposure to blast … The> mastermind is the government of the United States. It was a phoney,> government-engineered conspiracy to begin with. It would never have amounted> to anything had the government not planned it.” 15So here we have the bomb that exploded at the World Trade Center in 1993, builtby an informant on the FBI payroll and planted in a truck with a rentalagreement that included the phone number and address of a notorious Mossadagent, Josie Hadas! But there’s more. Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the “spiritualleader” of the Egyptian extremist group Gamaa Al-Islamya, was convicted inJanuary 1996 of “seditious conspiracy” and sentenced to life imprisonment forhis part in planning the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He was put on theState Department’s “watch list” in 1987, but recruited by the CIA in support ofOsama bin Laden and the Mujahadin in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation inthe 1980s. American foreign correspondent Mary Anne Weaver revealed that inPeshawar, Pakistan, in the late 1980s Sheikh Omar became involved with US andPakistani intelligence officials who were orchestrating the war against theSoviets and that the “sixty or so CIA and Special Forces officers based thereconsidered him a ‘valuable asset’.” 16 They overlooked his anti-western messageand his incitement to holy war, she wrote, because they wanted him to help unifythe mujahadin groups. Sheikh Omar was given a one-year visa to enter the UnitedStates on May 10th 1990 from a CIA agent posing as an official at the USConsulate in Khartoum, Sudan, and he arrived in New York in July 1990.17 Thevisa was revoked in November that year and the State Department warned theImmigration and Naturalization Service to watch for him. Instead, within months,they granted Sheikh Omar a green card (work permit) and two years later came theWorld Trade Center bombing for which he and others were convicted.18 A CIA assetwas convicted of conspiracy to plant a bomb that was made by an informant of theFBI and left in a rental truck connected to a Mossad agent. Unbelievable. We aresupposed to believe these guys when they tell us what happened on September 11thand who was responsible? Or that the CIA and FBI had no connection to whathappened and who did it? It was also later revealed, in keeping with the FBI’sappalling history of lies and cover-ups, that “evidence” was changed to supportthe prosecution of people the FBI claimed to be responsible for the 1993 WorldTrade Center bombing. On August 14th 1995, FBI special agent Dr FredericWhitehurst testified in the trial that the FBI concocted misleading scientificreports and pressured two of their scientists to lie to support its prosecutionof the defendants. He was asked if during his examination of bomb residuematerials and chemicals connected with the defendants, he became aware that theFBI agents investigating the case had developed a preliminary theory that thebomb that blew up the World Trade Center was a urea nitrate bomb? “That iscorrect,” he replied. The questioning continued as follows:> “Did there come a time when you began to experience pressure from within the> FBI to reach certain conclusions that supported that theory of the> investigation?”> “Yes, that is correct.”> “In other words, you began to experience pressure on you to say that the> explosion was caused by a urea nitrate bomb?”> “Yes, that is correct.”> “And you were aware that such a finding would strengthen the prosecution of> the defendants who were on trial, who were going on trial in that case,> correct?”> “Absolutely.” 19Special agent Frederic Whitehurst, the senior FBI explosives expert, foundhimself demoted to paint analysis. A Boston court released two men in January2001 who had spent 30 years in jail for a murder they did not commit because theFBI rigged the “evidence”. Two other innocent men also jailed for the killinghad already died in prison. The FBI was protecting an informant known as Joseph“the Animal” Barboza, who had been named to agents as one of those responsiblefor the murder. Barboza even gave testimony against the convicted men and wasprotected from prosecution by his FBI handlers, agents H. Paul Rico and DennisCondon. Agent Condon testified at the time in support of killer Barboza’scredibility and even after the trial when Barboza said that he had falsely namedthe four men, the FBI kept quiet and the courts denied a new trial.20 The FBIhad the Algerian pilot Lotfi Raissi jailed for five months amid claims that hetrained some of the 9/11 “pilots”, but then produced no evidence whatsoever tosupport that allegation. This is the same organisation that is telling you whathappened on September 11th and who did it.The “spy who knew”, but no one listened?More than a month before September 11th, Delmart Edward Joseph “Mike” Vreeland,who claims to be an operative with US Naval Intelligence, says he warned fromhis Canadian prison cell that the attacks were going to happen. Vreeland gave anote to prison guards listing potential targets including the World TradeCenter, the White House and the Pentagon, and it said: “Let one happen, stop therest.” Vreeland was in prison on what he says were manufactured charges relatingto credit card fraud that were designed to keep him out of circulation. He sayshe was in Moscow working for Naval Intelligence in the closing months of 2000 ona mission related to the “Star Wars” defence system, and flew to Toronto inDecember of that year. He said he had a sealed pouch containing intelligencedocuments that he was supposed to hand over, but when his contact didn’t turn uphe opened the pouch and read some of the contents. Vreeland says the documentsgave warnings of the planned attacks on the World Trade Center. This was ninemonths before they happened. Vreeland told investigator Mike Ruppert what thedocuments said:> “One document was written in English by a US agent, who had picked up a copy> of a document that had been sent to V. Putin by K. Hussein, Saddam Hussein’s> son. This is what the translation of the doc indicates. The Iraqis knew in> June 2000 that I was coming [to Russia]. I didn’t get my orders until August.> The letter said that Bastien [a Canadian embassy official later found dead]> and Vreeland would be dealt with ‘in a manner suitable to us.’ The letter> specifically stated on page two, ‘Our American official guarantees this.’” 21Vreeland was held by the Canadians at the request of the United States and hesays he told the Canadian authorities on December 6th 2000 that he needed tocontact the Canadian military immediately, but he said they “… turned blue,walked away, and I never saw them again”. Vreeland said he thought he wasdealing with idiots who had no clue about what was about to happen, but headded: “It’s been put to me that there were certain officials who wanted theattacks to happen.” US officials have denied that Vreeland is Naval Intelligenceoperative and say he was thrown out of the Navy after a few months in 1986. Butin January 2002 his lawyer called the Pentagon switchboard from an open courtand asked the operator for the office of Lieutenant Delmart Vreeland. Theoperator confirmed Vreeland’s rank as a Lieutenant O-3, his room number, andgave his direct-dial number. The people who lied about Vreeland are the samepeople telling you what happened on September 11th. With no one willing tolisten to him Vreeland wrote his warning on a piece of paper, sealed it in anenvelope, and handed it to jail guards a month before the attacks. They openedthe letter on September 14th and told the authorities. Vreeland would not revealwho gave him the document pouch because it would “jeopardise the lives of activeagents, and … violate the National Security Act of 1947”. Mike Ruppert’squestioning of Vreeland included the following exchange. Q:Your written warning contains the statement, “Let one happen, stop the rest.”Who was going to let one happen? Who was going to stop the rest?A.I can’t comment on the advice of counsel.Q:Does that statement imply that the US or some other intelligence agency hadachieved complete penetration of the terrorist cells?A:That goes without question. Sometimes certain governments design, createnetworks like al-Qaeda, which was really the government in Afghanistan. Thoseentities create specific problems at the creating government’s direction.[Problem-reaction-solution.]Q:Do you know who had achieved this penetration?A:I cannot comment on that.Q:Is it possible that the terrorist cells were being “run” without knowing bywhom?A:Absolutely.22 This is the compartmentalisation I keep emphasising in which those lower downthe pyramid, even very high up, do not know who is the ultimate “Mr Big” andwhat the agenda really is. Most al-Qaeda supporters see bin Laden as the top manbecause they know no better and have been told no different. Vreeland waseventually freed from jail and charges dismissed, but he still faced extraditionproceedings by the US government to take him back to the United States and hebelieved he would not survive very long if that were to happen. If he is anasset of Naval Intelligence, one of the major strands in the Illuminati web inthe US, we have to be careful about what he says, but that does not mean itisn’t true. Interestingly, contacts with connections into the Illuminati HighCouncil in the United States tell me that the Office of Naval Intelligence wasfundamentally involved in the organisation of the September 11th attacks.More confirmationEvidence of prior knowledge of the attacks is clear from other information. Theday before, the investment company Goldman Sachs circulated a memo warning of apossible terrorist attack and advising employees to stay away from Americangovernment buildings. Willie Brown, the Mayor of San Francisco, said he waswarned at 10pm the previous night by what he called “My security people at theairport” to be especially cautious about travelling by air on September 11th.23Why were the FBI and CIA not aware that something was bubbling? The fact is theywere. On August 28th the Federal Aviation Administration had issued a warning toairlines and airports that people connected to terrorist networks were planningto fly on US airlines, it is reported. Author Salman Rushdie, who has beentargeted by Arab extremists for his book The Satanic Verses, told the LondonTimes that he believed the US authorities knew of an imminent terrorist strikewhen they banned him from taking internal flights in Canada and the US just aweek before the attacks. “On September 3 the Federal Aviation Administrationmade an emergency ruling to stop Rushdie from flying unless airlines compliedwith strict and costly security measures,” the Times reported.24 Rushdie saidthe airlines would not upgrade their security. “The FAA told the author’spublisher that US intelligence had given warning of ‘something out there’ butfailed to give any further details,” the Times said. “The FAA confirmed that itstepped up security measures concerning Mr Rushdie but refused to give areason.” 25On September 18th, the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz reported that five Israelishad been “detained for what the Federal Bureau of Investigation has described as‘puzzling behaviour’ following the terror attack on the World Trade Center inNew York”. These people were not named, but the paper quoted one of theirmothers. She said they were arrested around four hours after the attacks whenthey were filming the scene from the roof of the building where they worked.“They thought that because he has citizenship of a European country as well asof Israel that he was working for the Mossad,” she added. Mossad is the Israeliintelligence agency that grew from the intelligence arm of the Rothschild familythat was formed back in the 18th/19th centuries. Police were called to the sceneand then the FBI because it is claimed they were seen “videotaping the disasterand shouting in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery”. The UK DailyTelegraph claimed that Mossad had “warned their counterparts in the UnitedStates the previous month that large-scale terrorist attacks on highly visibletargets on the American mainland were imminent.” The FBI denies this. TheWashington Post reported, as did Ha’aretz, that a New York-basedinstant-messaging firm called Odigo, which has offices in Israel, had confirmed“that two employees received text messages warning of an attack on the WorldTrade Center two hours before terrorists crashed planes into the New Yorklandmarks”.26 Micha Macover, the Odigo CEO, said two workers received themessages and had told the company’s management about the warnings after theattacks. Why hasn’t this blatant prior knowledge been investigated and followedup by the media? The Washington Times revealed the day before the attacks theexistence of an official 68-page report by 60 officers at the US Army’s Schoolfor Advanced Military Studies, which warned that Mossad was capable of targetingthe United States. The report described Mossad as “ruthless and cunning” and “awildcard”.27Casino prophetsThen there was the stock trading immediately before September 11th involvingairlines and companies involved in the attacks. This provides spectacularevidence of prior knowledge. Again the “government story is true” mindset hasled to media speculation that this trading must have been the work of Osama binLaden. But who is more likely to have been behind this, a guy in a cave inAfghanistan or those who run both the government and the banking/stock marketsystem? These include the CIA, which has long and fundamental connections to thefinancial elite. Many of the CIA’s leading personnel over the years have comefrom this very background, starting with its first director, Allen Dulles, theNazi supporter and business associate. The CIA claims to constantly monitorunusual financial transactions on the markets to track evidence of possibleterrorist and criminal activity. What does it call “unusual” when you considerwhat happened in the days before 9/11? The stock markets are not there tobenefit the people. They are casinos. A news report from Wall Street or theLondon Stock Exchange is little more than a report from Las Vegas on how theblackjack or roulette tables are going. They bet with people’s lives andlivelihoods. Two ways of doing this are “put” and “call” options. A “put option”is when you bet that the stock in a company will go down in value. If it doesyou can make big money. A “call option” is when you bet that the stock pricewill go up. Clearly the stock price in the airlines involved in the hijackings,American Airlines and United Airlines, would fall immediately after the attacks,as would that of companies with a major operation in the World Trade Center. Howfascinating, then, that 4,744 put options were placed on United Airlines againstonly 396 call options at the Chicago Board Options Exchange between September6th and 7th. Three days later, 4,516 put options were purchased on AmericanAirlines on the exchange and only 748 call options. This represented six timesthe usual number of put options, and trading in other airlines did not followthis pattern. The same trading can be seen in major companies at the World TradeCenter like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch, both of whom occupied22 floors, and in major insurance companies that would face enormous claims as aresult of the attacks. When these highly unusual trades were reported, revealingas they do blatant prior knowledge of the attacks, more than $2.5 million in putoption profits on United Airlines went unclaimed. Michael Ruppert, theresearcher and former Los Angeles Police Department drug investigator, makes aCIA connection to this evidence of insider trading in the days before September11th:> “That evidence also demonstrates that, in the case of at least one of these> trades - which has left a $2.5 million prize unclaimed – the firm used to> place the ‘put options’ on United Airlines stock was, until 1998, managed by> the man who is now in the number three Executive Director position at the> Central Intelligence Agency. Until 1997, A.B. ‘Buzzy’ Krongard had been> Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown. A.B. Brown was acquired by> Banker’s Trust in 1997. Krongard then became, as part of the merger, Vice> Chairman of Banker’s Trust-A.B. Brown, one of 20 major US banks named by> Senator Carl Levin this year as being connected to money laundering.> Krongard’s last position at Banker’s Trust (BT) was to oversee ‘private client> relations’. In this capacity he had direct hands-on relations with some of the> wealthiest people in the world in a kind of specialized banking operation that> has been identified by the US Senate and other investigators as being closely> connected to the laundering of drug money.” 28In 1998 Krongard was appointed as counsel to CIA Director George Tenet and waspromoted to Executive Director of the CIA by George W. Bush in March 2001. AfterKrongard left for the CIA, Bankers Trust-A.B.-Brown was taken over in 1999 byDeutsche Bank to form the biggest bank in Europe. Deutsche Bank was also usedfor the highly unusual pre-9/11 trading and its London branch is frequented,apparently, by the bin Laden family. Thus the question may be asked again. Whois more likely to have been behind these “prior knowledge” stock trades, Osamabin Laden from a cave in Afghanistan or the vast financial network connected tothe CIA? The same CIA that failed to respond to these highly unusual stockmovements just as US air defences failed to respond to four hijacked airliners.The same CIA and “intelligence community” that, despite a more than $30 billionannual budget (and that’s just the official one), claimed like the FBI that ithad no idea that the attacks were going to happen until it switched on TV withthe rest of the nation. When news of the stock trades broke, the CIA announcedthere would be an investigation, and media reports said that market regulatorsin the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Japan were to be involved. Haveyou ever heard another word about this “investigation”, even though thetransactions must be traceable? No, me neither. The trail did not lead to binLaden or the Islamic world, or sure as hell we would have seen it blazed acrossthe front pages a long time ago.Bush sued by families over 9/11Eight months after the attacks, a $7 billion lawsuit was filed against PresidentBush on behalf of families who lost loved ones. It was filed by San Franciscolawyer, Stanley Hilton, a former aide to presidential candidate, Bob Dole. Italleges that Bush and other government officials allowed the attacks to happenfor political gain and that Osama bin Laden has been used as a scapegoat. Hiltonsaid he had information that bin Laden died some years ago of kidney failure. Hetold the media: “I hope … [the lawsuit] … will expose the fact that there arenumbers of people in the government, including Bush and his top assistants, whowanted this to happen.” The class action suit, which represents the families of14 victims and involves 400 plaintiffs, names ten defendants, including Bush,Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, National SecurityAdviser Condoleeza Rice, and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Hilton saidhe has sources within the FBI, CIA, National Security Agency and Navalintelligence, and these made it clear that the official story was a lie. Icalled Stanley Hilton and we had a long talk about the lawsuit and hisinformation. He told me that the government had offered each of the families of9/11 victims $1.8 million if they waived the right to sue the government,security companies and the airlines etc., for what happened, but only 400 hadaccepted this at the time we spoke in July 2002. Hilton described the offer as a“bribe” and “hush money”. He said he was in touch with other lawyersrepresenting 9/11 families and the vast majority of them were extremelysceptical about the official tale. “The families feel basically that there’ssomething mysterious, there’s pieces of the puzzle missing.”Hilton told me that he had contacts that had been in several meetings with the“top Pentagon brass” before September 11th, at which the attacks were discussed.“They all knew this was being planned and they all had prior knowledge”, hesaid. “They all facilitated this to go through and, in my opinion, not onlyfacilitated it, but instigated it.” He said that US and Israeli intelligence hadinfiltrated al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups and knew precisely what wasgoing on. He said that Air Force personnel had told him that when Flight 77entered the No Fly Zone over Washington it gave the top secret code to indicatethat it was the President’s plane, Air Force One, and this was why there was noresponse from the capital’s ground-to-air defense system. Hilton said that aflight attendant with American Airlines, who knew many of the attendants whodied on September 11th, told him that a pilot on the American Airlines AirbusA300, which mysteriously crashed after take-off from New York two months after9/11, had some knowledge of what had happened during the attacks. She toldHilton that the pilot had been in the control tower at New York’s KennedyAirport while the hijackings were taking place and he knew the official storywas not true. She said he was having qualms about keeping quiet about what hehad seen and Hilton said the “unofficial rumour” at American Airlines was thatthe plane was sabotaged so that the pilot would be killed. Hilton said he hadlearned that many “top Bush officials” flew on American Airlines commercialplanes, but a few weeks before the attacks this stopped.Stanley Hilton said his experience since filing the suit had left him shocked atthe behaviour of the mainstream media, who were clearly just “foot soldiers forBush”. People had been urged to press for him to be disbarred, he said, and hehad been attacked as “unpatriotic”. What better confirmation can there be thathe is on to something?SOURCES > 1http://truthout.com/docs_02/05.24A.Political.Terror.htm> [http://truthout.com/docs_02/05.24A.Political.Terror.htm]> 2Report on Morning Edition, National Public Radio, September 11th 2001> 3http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow_piint.htm> [http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow_piint.htm]> 4http://arizona.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=3401&group=webcast> [http://arizona.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=3401&group=webcast]> 5http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=\\Nation\\archive\\200205\\NAT20020530d.html> [http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200205/NAT20020530d.html]> 69/11 – The Road To Tyranny and> http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow_print.htm> [http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow_print.htm]> 7Ibid> 8CNN, October 3rd 2001> 9CBS News, September 11th 2001> 10German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung (FAZ), September 14th 2001> 11MSNBC interview, September 15th 2001> 12Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast, by Ralph> Blumenthal, New York Times, October 28th 1993> 13Ibid.> 14http://www.newsmedianews.com/wtc.htm [http://www.newsmedianews.com/wtc.htm]> 15Atlantic Monthly, May 1996, quoted in the New American> http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm> [http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm]> 16http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm> [http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm]> 17Ibid> 18Official court transcript, p 16337> 19http://www.thebostonchannel.com/News/751977/detail.html> [http://www.thebostonchannel.com/News/751977/detail.html]> 20You can read the full interview at> http://www.rise4news.net/vreeland_interview.html> [http://www.rise4news.net/vreeland_interview.html]> 21Ibid> 22All Fall Down, p 14> 23Rushdie’s Air Ban, London Times, September 27th 2001> 24Ibid> 25Washington Post, September 27th 2001> 26Washington Times, September 10th 2001> 27Michael C.

The suggestion that government leaders andagencies were involved in the horrific events of 9/11 (under the instructions oftheir masters) to create an enormous problem to which they could offer a fascistsolution is not fantastic at all. History is ablaze with such events.Burning the ReichstagThe German Nazis burned down the Reichstag, the parliament building, using thisvery technique. Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on January 30th 1933, and onFebruary 27th the parliament building was torched and the attack blamed onMarinus van der Lubbe, a mentally challenged Dutch Communist who was laterexecuted for a crime he did not commit. The day after the fire, Hitler invokedArticle 48 of the Weimar Constitution that allowed civil liberties to besuspended during a “national emergency”. This Decree of the Reich President forthe Protection of the People and State brought an end to freedom of speech andthe press, right of assembly and association, right to privacy in postal andelectronic communications, protection against unlawful searches and seizures,individual rights to property, and the rights for states to be self-governing.Another decree created the federal “police” agencies, the SS or “specialsecurity” and the SA or “storm troops”. The rest, as they say, is history andlook at what has happened as a result of 9/11. What Hitler introduced to fight“Communist terrorism” was a mirror of what Bush has signed into law since theattacks in America. The sinking of the Lusitania, which brought the US into theFirst World War, the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought them into the Second,the list of P-R-S examples goes on and on, and you can read about countless morein And The Truth Shall Set You Free.“Chechnya terrorists”While I was writing this book the former Kremlin insider Boris Berezovskypublicly accused the Russian State Security Service (FSB) of organising thebombings of apartment blocks in Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999 toprovide the excuse for war against the separatist republic of Chechnya.President Putin was Prime Minister of Russia at the time. Berezovsky was onceone of the most powerful men in Russia and belonged to the inner circle of theformer Russian president Boris Yeltsin, which was known as “The Family”. But hefell from favour with Putin and the state arbitration court ordered the closureof Berezovsky’s TV6, the country’s last independent national television station.In an interview broadcast on the Ekho Moskvy radio station, Berezovsky said hewas preparing a package of documents to prove that it was the special servicesthat organised the explosions and they had been preparing another in Ryazan.“The authorities are simply afraid to hear the truth about their crimes,” hesaid. The Moscow bombings killed 228 people, including 21 children, and inVolgodonsk 199 died, two of them children. In the autumn of 2000, officials fromthe FSB (the equivalent of the FBI and formerly headed by Putin) said they hadproof that the blasts had been organised and financed by Chechens, but failed tosecure convictions. (In the autumn of 2001 officials from the FBI said they hadproof that the attacks had been organised and financed by Osama bin Laden, butfailed to produce the evidence.) On September 23rd 1999, only a week after thesecond bomb in Moscow, residents in an apartment block in Ryazan found bags inthe basement containing a substance that looked like hexogen, the explosive usedin the Moscow blasts. The local FSB said that an “act of terrorism” had beenprevented, but the federal FSB later said it was just a training exercise. Atraining exercise? Remember the excuse for the bomb squad’s presence around theMurrah Building in Oklahoma before the bomb went off was that they were on a“training exercise”. This after they had first denied the bomb squad was eventhere. A former FSB colonel, Alexander Litvinenko, now in exile in London, saysthe federal FSB office was not on a training exercise in Ryazan (and nor was theone in Oklahoma). Litvinenko says in his co-authored book, The FSB Blows UpRussia,1 that the planned blast involved federal FSB and was only prevented bythe local FSB. This is all classic problem-reaction-solution to justify aresponse against Chechnya, which just happens to be in the Caspian Sea regionand significant in the control of oil.Gulf of TonkinThe “incident” that exploded as the Vietnam War was another example of P-R-S andsometimes you don’t even need a problem, you just have to kid the people thatyou have one. President Lyndon “Brown & Root” Johnson, the man who replaced(without an election) the assassinated John F. Kennedy, announced on August 4th1964 that North Vietnam had attacked American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.The official story claimed a US destroyer on “routine patrol” was targeted byNorth Vietnamese torpedo boats in an “unprovoked attack” on August 2nd and thatthis action was repeated against US ships on August 4th. The media, as usual,reported this as fact simply because Johnson and the Pentagon said it was. Thetruth is, as many studies and investigative books have revealed, there was nosecond attack on August 4th and the first was not “unprovoked” against a US shipon “routine patrol”. The destroyer Maddox was actively involved in intelligencegathering to support attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese Navy andthe Laos Air Force. Two days later there was no repeat attack, it was pureinvention to escalate the war. Captain John J. Herrick, the head of the taskforce in the Gulf of Tonkin, sent cables to Washington that talked of “freakweather effects” and an “overeager sonarman” who was “hearing [his] ship’s ownpropeller beat”. Squadron Commander James Stockdale, a famous prisoner of warand later a vice presidential candidate to Ross Perot, was flying over the scenethat night. Years later he said that he had “the best seat in the house to watchthat event”. He said that there was no attack by the North Vietnamese gunboats:“… Our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets – there were no PT[North Vietnamese] boats there …There was nothing there but black water andAmerican fire power.” A year after President Johnson had used this non-existentattack to escalate the conflict into the Vietnam War, he said: “For all I know,our Navy was shooting at whales out there.” Tom Wells, author of The War Within:America’s Battle Over Vietnam,2 said that the government was able to deceive theAmerican people because of the media’s “almost exclusive reliance on USgovernment officials as sources of information” and their “reluctance toquestion official pronouncements on national security issues”. This happensevery time and never more so than after 9/11. In The Uncensored War: The MediaAnd Vietnam,3 Daniel C. Hallin writes that journalists had a great deal ofinformation available that contradicted the official version of events, but itwas ignored. He said that it was also “… generally known … that ‘covert’operations against North Vietnam, carried out by South Vietnamese forces with USsupport and direction, had been going on for some time”. Journalists and mediawatchers Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon encapsulate the responsibility of themedia in what followed the Gulf of Tonkin:> “By reporting official claims as absolute truths, American journalism opened> the floodgates for the bloody Vietnam War. A pattern took hold: continuous> government lies passed on by pliant mass media … leading to over 50,000> American deaths and millions of Vietnamese casualties.” 4Journalists, or those who pass for them, love to deny responsibility for theiractions. They say “we are just the messenger; don’t kill the messenger becauseyou don’t like the message”. But if the messenger accepts the message withoutquestion they cease to be some neutral, “independent” courier for informationand allow themselves to become an essential tool in the propaganda war againstthe people. At this point, which was reached a long time ago, they are not“journalists” at all. They are the public relations staff for the officialversion of life. After President Johnson went on national television to lieabout the Gulf of Tonkin and announce “retaliatory air strikes” that became theinsane Vietnam War, the media praised his speech and said the North Vietnamesehad only themselves to blame. Because of this support only two votes were castagainst the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that went through Congress three daysafter a US ship was not attacked by the North Vietnamese. For the Gulf of Tonkinread Pearl Harbor, Oklahoma, September 11th, and a whole stream of otherexamples of problem-reaction-solution. Or, in the case of the Gulf of Tonkin, a“no problem”-reaction-solution.Operation NorthwoodsThen there was Operation Northwoods. I mentioned this earlier, but I want toemphasise its manipulation techniques again at this point because they are sucha mirror of what happened on September 11th. Northwoods was the plan by the USJoint Chiefs of Staff (and the intelligence network if the truth be told) toorganise terrorist attacks against their own people 40 years ago that were to beblamed on Fidel Castro to justify an invasion of Cuba. Recently discoveredofficial documents5 reveal that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the same organisationthat failed to react when four commercial airliners were hijacked on 9/11, drewup a plan code-named Operation Northwoods that involved civilians being shot,planes being hijacked, boats being sunk, terrorist acts in US cities andinnocent people being blamed for it all. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs whopressed ahead with the plans was General Lyman L. Lemnitzer. I think the secondsyllable of his last name was a secret code for his state of mind. TheNorthwoods documents talk of developing a communist Cuban terror campaign in theMiami area and other Florida cities and even in Washington.6 The plan was tostir up so much hatred for Cuba in the United States that the people wouldsupport an invasion and even demand that this was done. They intended to explodeplastic bombs, arrest Cuban agents and release previously prepared documentssubstantiating Cuban involvement. The plan included attacks on the now infamousUS base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba where uncharged, untried “terrorists” are keptin disgraceful, inhuman conditions by the land of freedom and morality. Thedocuments speak of “a series of well co-ordinated incidents … in and aroundGuantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces”.7 AMemorandum of July 27th 1962 says that the operation would mean an enormousincrease in Cuban and American casualties.8 The techniques to be used includedthe following: starting rumours; using clandestine radio; landing friendlyCubans in uniform “over the fence” to stage attack on the Guantanamo base;capturing (friendly) Cuban saboteurs inside the base; starting riots near thebase main gate using friendly Cubans; blowing up ammunition inside the base andstarting fires; burning aircraft on the air base and blaming Cuba; throwingmortar shells into the base; capturing assault teams approaching from the sea orGuantanamo City; capturing a militia group, which storms the base to sabotage aship in harbour; sinking a ship near the harbour entrance; blowing up anunmanned vessel in Cuban waters … and blaming it on Cuban aircraft that wouldnaturally come and investigate what had happened; issuing false casualty liststo the US media to whip up public opinion against Cuba; conduct funerals formock victims.9All of this begs the question: who really did blow up the Khobar Towers in theUS military complex in Saudi Arabia? Who did blow up the Murrah Building? Whoreally did target those planes on September 11th? After all, who had easieraccess to the Khobar Towers, the Murrah Building, and all that was necessary tohijack those planes? Outsider terrorists or the insider US military and civilianauthorities? The Northwoods documents call for the use of Soviet Union MIG-typeaircraft flown by US pilots to harass civil aircraft, attack surface shippingand destroy US military drone (remotely controlled) aircraft to give theimpression it was all done by Communists. “An F-86 properly painted wouldconvince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG …” one document says.10 It wasfurther planned to stage the mock shooting-down of a US Air Force plane ininternational waters by simply getting the pilot, using a made-up name, toreport that he was under attack and then stop transmitting. He would then flyback to his base where the plane would be repainted with a new tail number andthe pilot would resume his real name. A US submarine would dispense aircraftwreckage in the sea and this would be found to confirm the attack and blame iton Cuba. Northwoods also planned the hijacking of civil air and surface craft.Documents say it was possible to create an incident in which people will believethat a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner on aflight from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Venezuela or Panama. Thedestination would be chosen to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba, andthe plan was to replace the civil airliner with an identical one painted in thecorrect colours and remotely controlled. The real plane would be landed at anAir Force base and the passengers, boarded under aliases, would be taken off.The remotely controlled replacement would be flown over Cuba, send a distresscall and then be destroyed by radio signal. All this was planned 40 years ago.Imagine what the technology is like today in comparison?Remote control?As we can see from the Northwoods documents, the remote control of largeaircraft is not in the least bit new and can be traced back more than fourdecades. After September 11th George W. Bush called for a system to be developedthat would allow controllers on the ground to assume remote control of ahijacked aircraft and direct it to a safe landing at the nearest airport. TheNew York Times quoted him as saying that the new technology, “probably far inthe future”, would allow air traffic controllers to land distressed planes byremote control.11 This was a gross misrepresentation of the truth, but then, asI have pointed out many times in my books and talks, Illuminati operatives speakto each other during public speeches and announcements in code that only theyunderstand. In this instance the “we must develop remote control technology”could easily mean, “we used remote control technology”. How can Bush say thatsuch technology is “probably far in the future” when the existence of remotelycontrolled aircraft is publicly known and has been in existence for at least 40years? A few weeks after 9/11 they were being flown over Afghanistan under theterm “surveillance drones”. A US Air Force fact sheet available to anyone on theInternet details the capabilities and background of a remotely controlledaircraft technology called the Global Hawk.12 It says that the Global HawkUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides Air Force battlefield commanders withnear real-time, high-resolution, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissanceimagery flying at extremely high altitudes to survey large areas with pinpointaccuracy. Once the “mission parameters” are programmed into Global Hawk, saysthe fact sheet, the aircraft can “autonomously taxi, take off, fly, remain onstation capturing imagery, return and land”. Operators on the ground can alterflying instructions during flight as necessary. Airman magazine summarised thecontrol systems of the Global Hawk:> “The bird’s “pilots” stay on the ground. Its flight control, navigation and> vehicle management are independent and based on a mission plan. That means the> airplane flies itself – there’s no pilot on the ground with a joystick> manoeuvring it around. However, it does get instructions from airmen at ground> stations. The launch and recovery element provides precision guidance for> take-off and landing, using a differential global positioning system. That> team works from the plane’s operating base.” 13The Global Hawk is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long, has a wingspan of 116 feet (35.3metres, equivalent to a Boeing 737), and a range of 12,000 nautical miles. Itcan fly at up to 65,000 feet (19,812 metres) at speeds approaching about 400mphfor as long as 35 hours. Global Hawk was developed through the 1990s and theprincipal contractor is the Illuminati-controlled Northrop Grumman at its RyanAeronautical Center, San Diego, California. Communications systems are providedby L3 Com, Salt Lake City, Utah. In June 1999 Global Hawk began tests andexercises sponsored by US Joint Forces Command. James Roche, the Bush-appointedUS Secretary of the Air Force, held many executive posts with Northrop Grumman,including Corporate Vice President and President, Electronic Sensors and SystemsSector, before leaving to join the Bush gang in 2001. Roche, a member of theIlluminati’s Council on Foreign Relations and Centre for Strategic Studies, isresponsible for the Air Force’s “functioning and efficiency, the formulation ofits policies and programs”.14 This includes NORAD.image [../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 20: The Global Hawk remotely-controlled aircraft Colonel Wayne M. Johnson became manager of the Global Hawk Programme at theReconnaissance Systems Program Office, Aeronautical Systems Center atWright-Patterson Air Force Base at Dayton, Ohio, which assumed total programmecontrol on October 1st 1998. (This is not far in flying terms from the pointwhere Flight 93 was “hijacked” and turned around.) On April 20th 2000 a GlobalHawk deployed to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida was flown across the Atlanticto Europe by remote control to take part in NATO exercises and on April 22nd –23rd 2001, it was flown non-stop the 7,500 miles across the Pacific from theEdwards Air Force Base in California to the Royal Australian Air Force base atEdinburgh, South Australia. This set (officially) new world records for remotecontrolled aircraft and the plane was deployed in the grotesquely namedOperation Enduring Freedom, the mass murder of civilians in Afghanistan. Anotherremotely controlled aircraft called the Predator, capable of reaching 25,000feet, was also deployed to Afghanistan and has been used in the formerYugoslavia. The organisation that has been using remote control in manydifferent aircraft during this more than 40-year period of development is NORAD.An article by Alan Staats, first published in Quill magazine in February 1998and posted on the Internet after 9/11, details the history and development ofremote control technology. Staats writes:> “Controlling the aircraft from the ground is nothing new. The military has> been flying obsolete high performance fighter aircraft as target drones since> the 1950s. In fact, NORAD (the North American Air Defense Command) had at its> disposal a number of US Air Force General Dynamics F-106 Delta Dart fighter> aircraft configured to be remotely flown into combat as early as 1959 under> the auspices of a program know as SAGE. These aircraft could be started,> taxied, taken off, flown into combat, fight, and return to a landing entirely> by remote control, with the only human intervention needed being to fuel and> re-arm them. To this day, drone aircraft are remotely flown from Air Force and> Naval bases all over the country to provide targets for both airborne and> ground based weapons platforms.”15Staats goes on to say that the technology now exists (writing in 1998) thatwould allow a ground crew to override and direct the flight path of a hijackedplane and that the military has employed this capability since the 1950s. Fromthe engineering point of view, he says, modifying and implementing thetechnology for use on passenger-carrying aircraft in the United States to flythem and land them by remote control “is a relatively simple matter.” (Myemphasis.) In fact, says Staats, “autoland” systems have been in wide commercialuse in different parts of the world since the 1980s. Auto landings are routinelyperformed thousands of times a day throughout the world and Staats continues:> “It is technically possible to create a system to perform remotely commanded> return flights of a hijacked airliner. Onboard digital command, control and> display equipment can easily share data with, and accept commands from, ground> control stations. Little input beyond the initial command to enter safe return> flight and the ultimate destination are needed.”Commercial aircraft are largely flown by computers today anyway and the pilotcan have very little to do with flying the plane once it’s off the ground. Inthe Boeing 747-400, for example, the computers are capable not only of landingthe aircraft, but also applying the brakes and stopping it, too. A flight planagreed with the Federal Aviation Administration, or its equivalent around theworld, is loaded into the aircraft computer system or Flight Management System(FMS). This can be done through direct programming or a disc. The flightprogramme includes the planned height and speed of the plane throughout theflight as it makes its way between points in the sky known as waypoints. Whenthe plane has taken off it aims for the first waypoint and then the computerwill execute changes to aim for the next point and so on to its destination.Therefore, as Staats points out:> “Because all the components of controlling the aircraft communicate with each> other digitally through a central unit, the FMS, activating such a “safe> return” system would be a matter of uploading commands to the FMS to fly the> aircraft to the nearest airport. Controlling the aircraft’s speed, altitude> and course, the FMS would guide it back to land.”In other words, to remotely control any commercial airliner all you need to dois get control of the Flight Management System computers and override theability of pilots to have an input. Do that and you can fly a plane wherever youlike with the pilots in the cockpit unable to do anything about it. You can alsoturn the transponder off and control the entire system, including blocking thepilot’s ability to send the normal hijacking alarm code that, remarkably, noneof the pilots on September 11th managed to do. We could, of course, find out ifthis was the case for sure by listening to the genuine cockpit voice recordersin the black boxes on the four aircraft, but we are not allowed to and, anyway,falsifying the tape or producing an alternative to fit the official line wouldbe child’s play. Staats says the data links that could remotely control digitalairborne flight control systems in commercial aircraft are already widely used.They are called ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System)and these communicate a long list of data including position, fuel consumption,weather and flight plan information to ground stations. ACARS also has theability to send data to the aircraft from the ground. This link, Staats pointsout, would allow “both uploading digital control inputs to control the aircraftas well as the potential to download and remotely monitor the digital aircraftdisplays”. Remember that in the secret research and development projects used bythe military and Illuminati levels of government, the technology at theirdisposal is a long, long way ahead of anything we are allowed to see in publicuse. Could those planes have been hijacked on September 11th by remote controland flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon while the pilots on boardjust looked on in horror? Technically, yes they could, quite easily. StanleyHilton, the lawyer who has filed a lawsuit against Bush and Co over 9/11, toldme he had spoken with a mechanic with United Airlines who personally worked onthis remote control system. If you can fly a plane from America to Australia andback without a pilot you will have no trouble directing one into the World TradeCenter. An article by investigator Joe Vialls, a former member of the Society ofLicensed Aeronautical Engineers and Technologists in London, claims, like manyresearchers, that the aircraft on September 11th were indeed taken over byremote control technology. Vialls writes:> “In the mid-seventies … two American multinationals collaborated with the> Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) on a project designed to facilitate> the remote recovery of hijacked American aircraft. [This] … allowed specialist> ground controllers to … take absolute control of [a hijacked aircraft’s]> computerized flight control system by remote means. From that point onwards,> regardless of the wishes of the hijackers or flight deck crew, the hijacked> aircraft could be recovered and landed automatically at an airport of choice,> with no more difficulty than flying a radio-controlled model plane … [This> was] the system used to facilitate direct ground control of the four aircraft> used in the high-profile attacks on New York and Washington on 11th September> 2001.” 16Vialls claims, without naming sources, that this technology allows specialistground controllers to hear cockpit conversations on an aircraft and take overits computerised flight control system by remote means. Vialls refers to thetechnology as “Home Run” and suggests that these top-secret computer codes werebroken on September 11th to allow control of the planes from the ground. Hewrites:> “In order to make Home Run truly effective, it had to be completely integrated> with all onboard systems, and this could only be accomplished with a new> aircraft design, several of which were on the drawing boards at that time.> Under cover of extreme secrecy, the multinationals and DARPA went ahead on> this basis and built “back doors” into the new computer designs. There were> two very obvious hard requirements at this stage, the first a primary control> channel for use in taking over the flight control system and flying the> aircraft back to an airfield of choice, and secondly a covert audio channel> for monitoring flight deck conversations. Once the primary channel was> activated, all aircraft functions came under direct ground control,> permanently removing the hijackers and pilots from the control loop.” 17Vialls says that the system began with the best of intentions – to save lives –but “finally fell prey to security leaks, and eventually to compromised computercodes”. My own view is that it was sold under the guise of saving lives, butwith a very different agenda going on higher up. Vialls says that thistechnology “piggy backs” on the plane’s transponder and this is why, hesuggests, the pilots were unable to send the hijack code from any of the manyactivation points on the aircraft. He says the “takeover” technology locks intothe frequency of the transponder’s communication channel overriding its use bythe pilot. Thus no hijack code is sent because, before the pilot realises thereis a problem, there is no transponder channel through which to communicate it.It should be mentioned, however, that the official story has some transpondersturned off some time after the planes began to act strangely. Vialls saysfurther that the cockpit listening capability of the “Home Run” technologyintercepts the microphones in the cockpit, which normally feed the pilots’conversations to the Cockpit Voice Recorder in a “black box”. The voicerecorders would therefore be blank, he says, because these microphones wouldhave been de-activated once the remote control took over. He claims thatLufthansa, the German national airline, took action to remove the “Home Run”technology:> “As long ago as the early nineties, a major European flag carrier [Lufthansa]> acquired the information and was seriously alarmed that one of its own> aircraft might be “rescued” by the Americans without its authority.> Accordingly, this flag carrier completely stripped the American flight control> computers out of its entire fleet, and replaced them with a home grown> version. These aircraft are now effectively impregnable to penetration by Home> Run, but that is more than can be said for the American aircraft fleet.” 18Andreas Von Bulow, the former Germany Minister for Defence and Minister ofScience and Technology, said in his outspoken interview with Tagesspiegel:“There is also the theory of one British flight engineer: according to this, thesteering of the planes was perhaps taken out of the pilots’ hands, from outside.The Americans had developed a method in the 1970s, whereby they could rescuehijacked planes by intervening into the computer piloting. This theory says thistechnique was abused in this case …” I called Von Bulow to ask if he couldconfirm what Vialls claims about Lufthansa, but he said he could not say eitherway. Brian Desborough, an American conspiracy researcher since the 1960s and aformer scientist with the Boeing Corporation, told me:> “Unlike earlier airliners such as the Boeing 747, which are equipped with> conventional hydraulically-operated flight controls, the Boeing 757 and 767> aircraft that were involved in the 9/11 incidents, and the Airbus 300 which> crashed at Queens [New York], have fly-by-wire flight control systems as a> weight-saving measure. These aircraft types are equipped with a special black> box that was developed by the US Department of Defense Research Agency, DARPA.> If terrorists attempt to hijack a fly-by-wire aircraft and deviate off course,> the black box prevents whoever is piloting the aircraft from sending flight> commands to the flight control surfaces and engines.

I’m aware of a very> covert research company in California engaged in the development of advanced> engines for tanks. A remote surveillance plane circles overhead every day as a> security measure, yet is invisible from the ground.” 19So it was possible to take control of those planes from the ground on September11th and fly them wherever the controllers wanted them to go. Does this not makemore sense than incompetent Dumb and Dumber pilots who had struggled to fly aCessna at US flying schools? Also, looking at this in another way, if theseplanes did have “anti-hijack” remote control technology why were they allowed tocrash? Why were they not landed safely?“The enemy within the gates”Kent Hill, an American Airlines captain on European routes and a life-longfriend of “Chic” Burlingame, the pilot of AA Flight 77, is certainly questioningthe official story. The two were graduates of the Naval Academy, flew in Vietnamand had flown together with American Airlines for 28 years. Hill could notunderstand why there was no hijack code sent from any of the planes. He saysthat they were all trained “on the old type of hijack” where the hijacker istreated cordially, the pilot punches a four-digit code into the transponder toalert ground control that the plane has been hijacked, and then takes hijackerswhere they wish to go and puts the plane on the ground. “However, this is atotally new situation,” he says, “not one of the planes alerted ground controlthat they were being hijacked. How come?” 20 Hill says he’s sure that none ofthe pilots had control of the aircraft when they crashed because no pilot woulddo that. “Even if I had a gun at my head, I’d never fly a plane into a building.I’d try to put it in anywhere – a field or a river – and I’d be searing the hellout of them by flying upside down first.” 21 How does all this square with theclaims that Barbara Olson rang her husband, Bush’s Solicitor General Ted Olson,to say that the pilot of Flight 77 was at the back of the plane with her, and toask what she should she tell him to do?The question is who or what was in control of the planes during the attacks,“hijacker pilots” or remote control from the ground. Retired Colonel Donn deGrand Pré, a friend of Hill, says he gathered together a group of experiencedcivilian and military pilots, including combat fighter pilots and commercialairline captains, to discuss what could have happened during what he describedas a “so-called terrorist attack [that] was in fact a superbly executed militaryoperation against the United States, requiring the utmost professional militaryskill in command, communications and control”.22 The group concluded, he said,that “the enemy is within the gates, that he has infiltrated into the highestpolicy-making positions at the Federal level, and has absolute control, not onlyof the purse strings, but of the troop build-up and deployment of our militaryforces, including active, reserve and National Guard units”. The colonelreported that the group of highly experienced pilots was not impressed by claimsthat the four aircraft were flown by hijackers who had trained in planes likethe Cessna. He said one officer remarked: “I seriously question whether thesenovices could have located a target dead-on 200 miles removed from take-offpoint – much less controlled the flight and mastered the intricacies of 11FR[instrument flight rules] – and all accomplished in 45 minutes.” The pilots saidthat the way the planes were flown ruled out the level of experience andcompetence reported for the “hijackers”. An Air Force officer, who flew morethan 100 sorties over North Vietnam, is quoted by the colonel as saying: “Thosebirds either had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat, or they were beingmanoeuvred by remote control.” Former Special Forces sergeant turned conspiracyinvestigator, Stan Goff, put it like this in the case of Flight 77:> “Now, the real kicker. A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a> Florida puddle-jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas, conducts a> well-controlled downward spiral, descending the last 7,000 feet in> two-and-a-half minutes, brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips the> electrical wires across the street from the Pentagon, and flies it with> pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at 460 nauts. When the theory> about learning to fly this well at the puddle-jumper school began to lose> ground, it was added that they received further training on a flight> simulator. This is like saying you prepared your teenager for her first drive> on I-40 at rush hour by buying her a video driving game. It’s horse shit!> There is a story being constructed about these events.” 23I had a long conversation with a pilot who has flown commercial airliners forLufthansa for 28 years and trained as a military pilot before that. He dismissedimmediately the idea that the “hijacker-pilots” could have taken over thecontrols of the four planes from their computer systems and flown them manually.His view would have been that they would have crashed the planes for sure longbefore they reached their targets, such is the complex nature of the modernairliner. It is this very complexity, which requires that computers make thecalculations, he told me. He did say, however, that hijackers would not need toknow how to fly the plane to hit a target. They would only need to know how toreprogramme the Flight Management System to make the computer do it for them. Itake the point, but this begs more questions. If that is the way it was done whywould the “hijackers” have trained at flying schools on Cessnas and similarsmall planes when the Lufthansa pilot told me this would be utterly useless andirrelevant to flying a 757 or 767 and equally so for knowing how to reprogram aFlight Management System? This doesn’t make sense at all. Although he said thereprogramming could be done pretty quickly by someone who knows what he’s doing,Flight 175, the second one to strike the World Trade Center, dramaticallychanged course only 90 seconds to two minutes after the last communication withair traffic control if we believe those communications were accurate. In thattime the “hijackers” would have had to seize control of the cockpit, disable thepilots and reprogramme the computer system. Again this doesn’t make sense. Butif the plane’s controls were suddenly taken over externally and allcommunications from the cockpit were blocked by the remote control technologythese circumstances could be explained. One second you are flying a plane andtalking with air traffic controllers, the next the aircraft is flying off courseand when you tell air traffic control they do not respond because they can’thear you and you can’t hear them.Were “pilot” hijackers on board?There is something very strange about the whole “hijackers took over theaircraft” story. It might sound feasible to most people at first hearing and tothose who research or question no further. But when you do dig deeper there aremany questions. As I have already outlined, around a third of the “hijackers”named have turned out to be still alive. American and United Airlines refuse toconfirm that the men named by the FBI even passed through their normal check-inprocedures. All it needed was a simple yes or no, but they said I would have toask the FBI who then said they could not answer any questions because of an“ongoing investigation” and that it may be years before I could find any answersthrough the Freedom of Information Act, which does not reveal informationclaimed to be important to “national security” anyway. There were no securityvideo cameras in the departure lounges at Boston Logan Airport so we can’t seethe “hijackers” boarding Flights 11 and 175. Where there is video surveillancefootage at Newark, New Jersey, Washington Dulles and in other areas of theBoston Airport complex, we are not allowed to see it. This is exactly whathappened with the video footage of McVeigh and “friends” in Oklahoma. One thingis certain: if the video footage in and around those airports showed thehijackers arriving in their cars, checking in, going through security andboarding the planes it would have been blasted on every television station inthe world. They didn’t have any problem releasing the footage of “Atta” and“Alomari” rushing to catch the flight from Portland, Maine, that morning or theshots of “Alomari” getting cash the previous night from an ATM machine. Why arethey so shy about the real-deal footage that would confirm their story? The factis that all this time later we still have no proof or independent confirmationthat the men named by the FBI were even on the planes. I have given the FBI thechance to provide that, but the bureau refused. Not a single Arab name is on thepassenger lists issued by the airlines and while they may say they were notgiven permission to do so by their families this is yet another of the amazingcoincidences that pepper, indeed deluge, the official story. What happened thatday, if you believe the official version, is that phone calls were made bypassengers describing their plight as it was happening. The UK Daily Telegraphreported that “passengers on the hijacked aircraft were ordered to phone theirfamilies and tell them they were going to die” and “passengers were ordered atknifepoint to say that their flight had been hijacked and they were going tocrash into the White House”.24 Why on earth would hijackers force passengers tocall their relatives and give such specific information when the climax of theplan was yet to be completed?Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it a superscam?The story of Flight 77 is a catalogue of contradictions. There are two publishedversions of its route, as I outlined earlier. Both are sourced to the flighttracking company, Flight Explorer, which receives its data from the FAA. The USAToday version suggests it took a massive detour off-course in a north to west tosouth loop over West Virginia before returning to course for a short time, whilethe other does not include the loop. Both agree that the transponder signaldisappeared from the screens of air traffic control near the Ohio border. Evenso, NORAD was not alerted according to the official story agreed by NORAD andthe Federal Aviation Administration. The plane then completed a 180-degree turnand headed back towards Washington, but still there was no report to NORAD evenwith two hijacked planes already buried in the World Trade Center. Only at 9.24was NORAD alerted by the FAA, both organisations told me. This was some 40minutes after Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center; it was at least 35minutes after air traffic controllers knew that Flight 77 had been hijacked; 24minutes after the transponder signal was lost; 21 minutes after Flight 175 hitthe World Trade Center; and 18 minutes after air traffic control facilitiesthroughout the country knew that Flight 77 had likely been hijacked. Then NORADsays it sent jets from Langley, 130 miles away, instead of alerting Andrews tenmiles down the road. The anomalies and contradictions abound with Flight 77wherever you look.The Olson storyA Miami Herald report of September 14th 2001 says that CNN contributor, BarbaraOlson, first rang her husband, the US Solicitor General Ted Olson, at about 9.25to say the plane had been hijacked. Why wait so long to call when the plane isknown to have been hijacked before 9 o’clock? Other stories say she called soonafter the hijack in yet another example of the maze of contradictions thatsurround 9/11 and are designed to muddy the waters. One report says that Olson’soffice told the media that Barbara “… got on the wrong plane by mistake.” 25 Ifthat is correct, it is a very strange thing to say. She had apparently intendedto fly the night before, but changed her mind so she could be with her husbandon the morning of his birthday, September 11th. This, however, would not explainthe statement that “she got on the wrong plane by mistake”. Barbara Olson isclaimed to have asked her husband what she should tell the pilot, who was, shesaid, at the back of the plane with her. Two things come to mind. If that istrue, it means the pilots allowed themselves to be overpowered and thrown out ofthe cockpit simply by being threatened with knives and box cutters, and quietlyvacated the controls for the hijackers. I don’t believe it. Captain Charles F.“Chic” Burlingame III, the pilot of Flight 77, was a graduate of the “Top Gun”fighter pilot school and a Vietnam veteran. Is he going to give up the cockpitthat easily? Of course not. Whatever the precise details turn out to be, I haveto say that I don’t believe the official Olson story as currently presented.There is still a great deal more to know that we are not being told.No plane?The way the plane was flown into the Pentagon was fantastic given how it is saidto have turned so tightly at such a fast speed and come in so low. Indeed, therehave been suggestions that it was not the 757 at all, but a smaller plane orwinged missile and, of course, these have been dismissed as crazy and bizarre bythe media and the authorities. It has been widely noted that there is remarkablylittle “aircraft” wreckage at the Pentagon given that it was supposed to havebeen hit by a Boeing 757. It struck me how many major pieces of wreckage werestill visible after a Russian airliner and a DHL cargo plane collided at around36,000 feet and crashed to the ground in Germany in July 2002. Advocates of the“no plane theory” say that the hole in the Pentagon made by the impact isnothing like big enough for a 757 to have gone through without the wingssmashing into the sides of the hole and against the recently reinforced andstill standing walls of the Pentagon. A larger section of wall only collapsedsome half an hour after the initial explosion and the actual impact hole was farsmaller than the one we saw after that wall came down (Figure 21). Others haverejected these suggestions with the claim that when the plane struck thebuilding the wings would have collapsed back against the fuselage and slippedthrough the hole made by the impact from the front of the aircraft. But the noplane advocates point to pictures of a less than 10 foot wide hole made when theobject, whatever it was, exited on the other side of three rings of buildingswithin the Pentagon (Figure 22). The official story says that this hole was madeby the nose of the 757 or an engine. Those questioning this version say the noseof an aircraft is fragile and between the point of impact and the little holewhere the object came out are three rings of buildings in an area of thePentagon that had just undergone serious reinforcement to protect againstterrorist attack. Aerial photographs confirm this, as indeed does DefenseSecretary Rumsfeld who said the plane “penetrated three of the five concentricrings of the building”.26 That means the plane had to smash through six outerwalls. Could an aircraft not designed structurally to stay intact on impact, thegathering sceptics ask, have been able to score through three reinforced ringsof buildings and still be so intact that it could have caused the hole on theother side? The official version is a blaze of apparent contradictions. It saysthat when the plane struck the building it “pulverised”; the disappearance ofthe engines and other solid components can be explained by the fact that they“melted”; the absence of 100 tons of melted metal is that the inferno was so hotat more than 2,500 degrees centigrade that everything “evaporated”; the littleexit hole, around ten feet across, was caused by the nose or engine of theaircraft, which had penetrated three reinforced buildings despite all of theformer.27 I find it rather difficult to accept that all of those statements canbe true! The official tale was summed up by the French website that hashighlighted the contradictions of the Pentagon crash:> “The aircraft thus disintegrated on contact with the Pentagon, melted inside> the building, evaporated at 2500°C, and still penetrated two other buildings> via a hole 2½ yards in diameter.”28image [../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 21: Most people remember the pictures of the Pentagon after the wallcollapsed, but this only happened half an hour after “impact”. Before that therewas a much smaller impact hole image [../Images/00024.jpg]Figure 22: This is the exit point for whatever struck the Pentagon and the holeis estimated at less than ten feet across. Something ploughed through threerings of buildings and six external walls to cause this damage. What was it? Dick Bridges, the deputy manager for Arlington County, was quoted by AssociatedPress as saying that both the black boxes for Flight 77 were found “… rightwhere the plane came into the building”.29 But if that’s the case where was therest of the wreckage if much of the plane only made it that far and how could italso have scored through those three rings of buildings? The cockpit voicerecorder was so badly damaged, it is claimed, that it didn’t yield anyinformation – despite the astonishing heat and pressures it was built towithstand. Once again, how convenient. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. ColonelGeorge Rhynedance said in the Associated Press report that the two black boxeswere recovered at 4am, were in the possession of the FBI, and were beingexamined with help from the National Transportation Safety Board (what acombination). Dick Bridges said the voice recorder was damaged on the outsideand the flight data recorder was charred, but he said the FBI was stillconfident the data could be recovered from both. So where the hell is theinformation from the black boxes, then? As I mentioned, some researchers havesuggested there was no 757, only a bomb, a small plane, or a missile. Wingedmissiles are used by the US military and guided to their target by computer(Figure 23). Here is an Internet profile of the Cruise missile used by the USmilitary:image [../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 23: Some suggest that a winged cruise missile (above) was the real causeof the damage at the Pentagon or an unmanned remotely-controlled “drone” likethe Global Hawk. Others say it was definitely the Boeing 757 > “Cruise missiles are jet-propelled pilotless aircraft designed to strike> distant targets with great accuracy. Travelling at hundreds of miles an hour,> cruise missiles use the global positioning system, inertial guidance, optical> scenery correlation, and terrain comparing radar to find their targets. Their> accuracy makes them especially useful in attacking military targets in urban> areas with limited damage to nearby civilian facilities.> “Once airborne, its turbojet engine starts, its wings spread, and it noses> over to hug the surface at about 500 miles (800 km) per hour toward its> target.

One witness, Steve Patterson, said he was watchingthe World Trade Center coverage on television when he saw a “silver commuterjet” fly past the window of his 14th-floor apartment in Pentagon City. He saidthe plane was about 150 yards away coming in from the west and about 20 feet offthe ground. Patterson said it sounded like the high-pitched squeal of a fighterjet, and came over Arlington cemetery so low that he thought it was going toland on the road. Patterson said it was moving so fast that he couldn’t readanything on the side of the “plane”, which appeared only big enough to hold 8 to12 people.31 Another witness account by Lon Rains, the editor of Space News,said: “At that moment I heard a very loud, quick whooshing sound that beganbehind me and stopped suddenly in front of me and to my left. In fractions of asecond I heard the impact and an explosion. The next thing I saw was thefireball. I was convinced it was a missile. It came in so fast it soundednothing like an airplane …” 32The Northwoods Documents of 40 years ago tell of plans to trick people intobelieving that were seeing what they were not. One document says “An F-86properly painted would convince air passengers that they saw a Cuban MIG …” Theaccount of Danielle O’Brien, an air traffic controller at Washington DullesAirport, described what appeared to be anything but a 757 commercial airliner onher radar screen as it sped towards Washington:> “I noticed the aircraft. It was an unidentified plane to the southwest of> Dulles, moving at a very high rate of speed … I had literally a blip and> nothing more.”She asked her colleague Tom Howell if he had seen it.> “I said, ‘Oh my God, it looks like he’s headed to the White House.’ I was> yelling … ‘We’ve got a target headed right for the White House!’ At a speed of> about 500 miles an hour, the plane was headed straight for what is known as> P-56, protected air space 56, which covers the White House and the Capitol.> “The speed, the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the> radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a> military plane. You don’t fly a 757 in that manner. It’s unsafe.> “The plane was between 12 and 14 miles away and it was just a countdown. Ten> miles west. Nine miles west … Our supervisor picked up our line to the White> House and started relaying to them the information, [that] we have an> unidentified very fast-moving aircraft inbound toward your vicinity, 8 miles> west.> “And it went ‘six, five, four, and I had it in my mouth to say, three, and all> of a sudden the plane turned away. In the room, it was almost a sense of> relief. This must be a fighter. This must be one of our guys sent in,> scrambled to patrol our capital, and to protect our president, and we sat back> in our chairs and breathed for just a second.”Then came the fantastic 360-degree turn at high speed.> “We lost radar contact with that aircraft. And we waited. And we waited. And> your heart is just beating out of your chest waiting to hear what’s happened.> And then the Washington National [Airport] controllers came over our speakers> in our room and said, ‘Dulles, hold all of our inbound traffic. The Pentagon’s> been hit.’” 33Firefighters say they saw what they believed to be the nose of an aircraft, oras Captain Defina put it: “The only way you could tell that an aircraft wasinside was that we saw pieces of the nose gear.” 34 Where was the engine thatwas supposed to have caused the exit hole? He also said, referring to the fuel:“We have what we believe is a puddle right there that the – what we believe isto be the nose of the aircraft.” 35 It is also true that some witnesses – theremarkably few that have been reported – have said that they saw an AmericanAirlines commercial aircraft, but there is some interesting analysis of this“evidence” on the San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center website thatshould be read before taking all these accounts on face value.36I have spoken with other contacts that have friends in the Pentagon and they sayit was definitely a commercial airliner and one contact claims he has seen apicture from a surveillance camera that clearly shows the 757. Personally, Iwould have great reservations about any information that comes out of thePentagon and if such a photograph exists it certainly hasn’t been shown to thepublic. I asked former FAA air crash investigator Rodney Stich for his opinionof these “no plane” stories and he was distinctly unimpressed and said they hadno validity. He said he has seen many crashes into buildings in which nowreckage could be seen on the outside. Navy Captain Glenn N. Wagner, director ofthe Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory in Rockville, Maryland, said ateam of forensic pathologists, odontologists, a forensic anthropologist, DNAexperts, investigators and support personnel worked for more than two weeks toidentify victims of the attack on the Pentagon had claimed to have identified184 of the 189 who died in the plane and in the building.37 You either believethis or you don’t, I guess. My view is that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon.Survelliance camera stills from the Pentagon have been published, but they werefar from conclusive to say the least. Many researchers claimed them to be faked.If, however, clear and conclusive surveillance camera pictures of the plane doexist, as a contact told me, why don’t the authorities show them to us and bringan end to the speculation? Let us see them and put an end to all this. Theplane/no plane debate is not something that needs to be proved either way toprovide the evidence of an insider operation. There is already enough for that.If conclusive pictures do not exist to show the plane we might, legitimately,ask why. In a city awash with surveillance cameras, television crews andtourists there is a remarkable lack of pictures of the “plane” flying acrossWashington and into the Pentagon. In fact there aren’t any that the public hasbeen shown, apart from Pentagon survelliance stills that are so unclear that the“plane” has to be pointed out, and the FBI confiscated surveillance camerafootage immediately after the crash, just as it did after Oklahoma. Given whathas been done and planned in the past we would do well not to dismiss anythingout of hand before looking at everything very carefully. Could the “757” havebeen a smaller remotely-controlled “drone” painted in similar colours to theAmerican Airlines jet? Remember how the Operation Northwoods documents include aplan to land a commercial airliner and its passengers at an Air Force base andreplace it with a remotely controlled drone aircraft that would have been flownover Cuba and exploded by radio signal:> “An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate> for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in> the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for> the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers,> all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft> would be converted into a drone. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the> actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.> “From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to> minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Elgin AFB where> arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the> aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to> fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on> the international distress frequency a “May Day” message stating he is under> attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by> destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This> will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] radio stations in> the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what has happened to the aircraft> instead of the US trying to “sell” the incident.”Many of the world’s military leaders are very disturbed people who areemotionally deformed. They would have no problem doing whatever is necessary tobring about the desired end. As General Curtis E. LeMay, a US Air Force Chief ofStaff, once said: “There are no innocent civilians … so it doesn’t bother me somuch to be killing innocent bystanders.” 38 If the Pentagon was not hit byFlight 77 then, as the sceptics of the “no-plane” theory have rightly asked,where the hell did it go and what happened to the crew and passengers? Onepossible answer to the first question is that once the transponder is turned offthe controllers can see a blip on the radar screen, but they lose the altitudeand identification information from the plane. The Northwoods documents say thetake-off times of the remotely controlled drone aircraft and the actualcommercial aircraft would be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.The rendezvous could have involved both planes flying close enough to each otherfor both to appear as one “blip” on the radar screen and at that point the dronetakes over the flight path of the real passenger plane, which pulls away andlands at an air base. During the period when Flight 77’s transponder went offand controllers say they “lost” radar contact for ten minutes, this “switch”could have happened. I am not saying it did, only that it is possible. Thepilots on board Flight 77 might have been told by military personnel to land theplane at the nearest Air Force base because of threats from terrorists. Whoknows? What would have happened to them in the circumstances would be prettyobvious. But, if you follow the official story, there would not even have beenthe need to “rendezvous” another aircraft on the radar screen with Flight 77because it is said that air traffic control lost complete contact with it forthat ten minutes after it turned around. Look also at the published maps of theroutes taken by the four planes, based on information originating with the FAA.In the case of Flights 11, 175, and 93, they record the course they took evenafter the transponders were said to be turned off and they were tracked byconventional radar. But with Flight 77 they show only an estimated coursebecause they could not track it. Why? Why only with Flight 77 – the very planethat is the subject of so much speculation over whether it did or did not strikethe Pentagon? Why, as some reports suggest, did it take Flight 77 some 15minutes longer to return to Washington than it took on the outward journey?There is a great deal more to know about Flight 77 that we are not yet aware of.The same goes for each of the planes, in fact, and it is going to take aninsider to speak out for the details to be known. One thing to remember is thatdeception often works best when it is particularly outrageous because mostpeople’s minds could simply not comprehend that anyone would do such a thing,and they therefore dismiss the idea as crazy.What happened to flight 93?The Pentagon crash has received far less coverage than those involving the WorldTrade Center and this is even more the case with Flight 93, which crashed about80 miles east of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. By comparison it is hardlymentioned. Flight 93 pulled back from the gate at Newark International Airportat 8.01am bound for San Francisco, but did not take off until 8.42. UnitedAirlines have confirmed this take-off time to me, but could not explain thedelay. If the delay was not part of the plan this would have knocked the timingsout by up to around 40 minutes. The plane headed west over Pennsylvania and intonorthern Ohio – home of the military’s remote-control aircraft headquarters atWright-Patterson Air Force Base. The crew apparently received a message fromUnited Airlines warning all pilots of a potential “cockpit intrusion”. Thepilots confirmed receipt of the message and, because of its late departure, thiswas the only one of the four planes that had prior warning of possible trouble.It is claimed that Flight 93 was hijacked around 9am. This was some 20 minutesinto the flight and after the first plane had crashed into the World TradeCenter. ABC News reported at the time that shortly before the plane changeddirection someone in the cockpit asked the FAA for a new flight plan with afinal destination of Washington. I asked the Federal Aviation Administration whomade this request, but a media spokesman said he couldn’t answer that question.Why would hijackers announce their destination when Flight 77 made no suchrequest? We are told it was 9.16 when the Federal Aviation Administration toldNORAD that Flight 93 may have been hijacked, but that it was not until 9.40amthat the transponder signal was lost. Both the FAA and NORAD told me they hadopen lines to discuss what to do about Flights 77 and 93. The official storysays that hijackers forced their way into the cockpit wearing red bandanasaround their heads, and one of them warned he had a bomb attached to his waist.The hijackers said they were taking the plane to another airport, we are told.Air traffic controllers apparently claim that they heard two short radiotransmissions around the time the hijackers “stormed the cockpit” and in onethey heard a pilot say: “Get out of here.” An unnamed government official quotedin the media said there were at least four radio transmissions in which thephrases “bomb on board”, “our demands” and “keep quiet” were heard.39 ABC Newsclaimed to have secured a tape of these transmissions in which a hijacker says:“We’d like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board. And we are goingto turn back to the airport. And they had our demands, so please remain quiet.”40The official version is that passengers attacked the hijackers and the planesmashed into a field at Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at an estimated 575 miles anhour. The time of impact was anything between around 10am and 10.37, againdepending on the report you read. NORAD estimated the impact at 10.03 in ane-mail to me. This time window is two hours or more after Flight 11 left Bostonand half an hour or more after Flight 77 is said to have struck the Pentagon.What is hard to comprehend is that some seriously big guys could be herded tothe back of the plane and guarded by one hijacker, as claimed in phone calls. Iunderstand that he claimed to have a bomb, but that begs the question of why thesame claim was not made by hijackers on the other flights to subdue passengersif that was believed necessary. Passenger Mark Bingham was a rugby player whostood six foot four; Jeremy Glick was a rugby player and judo champion; ToddBeamer was over six foot and 200 pounds, and another, Lou Nacke, was a 200-poundweightlifter with a “Superman” tattoo on his shoulder. The hijacker would havehad no chance if they had challenged him, and neither would the others probably.The last transmission heard from the cockpit is said to be someone shouting,“Get out of here. Get out of here”, followed by grunting, screaming andscuffling, and finally silence. One researcher says he spoke with Deena Burnett,wife of passenger, Tom Burnett Jr, who said that her husband called her on acell phone to tell her of the hijack. She said he revealed that the hijackershad said in English that they were going to fly the plane into the ground.41 Themedia was twisting the story, she is claimed to have said, to make it look likethey were trying to save people on the ground when they were trying to savethemselves. My question, however, is why hijackers would tell the passengersthat they were going to crash the plane when this would clearly trigger aresponse on the basis of “What do we have to lose”? Why would these “hijackers”want to fly the plane into a field when the three others targeted the verysymbols of American power and self-confidence? How does this fit with theofficial story that the passengers were told by the hijackers that they had abomb on board and were flying the plane back to the airport? It makes no senseat all.In April 2002, after months of stalling by the FBI, the families of passengerson Flight 93 were allowed to hear the cockpit voice recording (or what wasclaimed to be the recording, you can take nothing for granted with theseagencies). Tom Burnett, the father of Tom Burnett Jr, said the tape wasdifficult to follow. “A lot was unintelligible, and a lot of it we couldn’tfollow very easily, so I don’t think it gives us resolution,” he said.42 But hefelt he had “learned something, another piece of the puzzle”. Burnett’s wife,Deena, said they were told that the recording would be played at the trial ofZacarias Moussaoui, the man accused of being an accomplice in the 9/11 attacks.The FBI has only said that the voice recorder includes screaming and sounds of astruggle.43 Newsweek claims to have been given a transcript of the cockpitrecorder from FBI sources:> “Beginning at 9.57, the cockpit voice recorder began to pick up the sounds of> a death struggle. There is the crash of galley dishes and trays being hurled,> a man’s voice screaming loudly. The hijackers can be heard calling on each> other to hold the door. One of the passengers cries out, ‘Let’s get them!’> More crashing and screaming. In a desperate measure to control the rebellion,> a hijacker suggests cutting off the oxygen. Another one tells his confederates> to ‘take it easy.’ The end is near. The hijackers can be heard talking about> finishing off the plane, which has begun to dive. The hijackers cry out, “God> is great!” The cockpit voice recorder picks up shouting by one of the male> passengers. It is unclear whether the passengers have breached the cockpit or> are just outside the door. The hijackers apparently begin to fight among> themselves for the controls, demanding, ‘Give it to me.’”Mmmm. And then some.Flight 93 shot down?I don’t think the passengers storming the cockpit caused the plane to crash andthe FBI has never confirmed that the passengers got into the cockpit. It is farfrom impossible that Flight 93 was shot down. The authorities vehemently denythis, but with their track record for telling the truth I’ll make up my own mindthank you. I’m sure there is something highly significant about Flight 93 andwhy that plane was stopped before it reached a target. President Bush did notgive the order to intercept and shoot down any commercial airliner that refusedinstructions to turn away from Washington until after the Pentagon had been hit.He had nearly an hour to give this order to protect Washington after Flight 11crashed and more than 35 minutes after the crash of Flight 175. But through mostof this time he was hearing a story about a pet goat and after he emerged fromthe classroom he issued no such order until after the Pentagon strike. This wasconfirmed by Vice President Dick Cheney who told the Meet the Press programme:“I wholeheartedly concurred in the decision he made, that if the plane would notdivert, if they wouldn’t pay any attention to instructions to move away from thecity, as a last resort our pilots were authorized to take them out.” 44 Flight93 was only the one in the air when the military were given permission toshoot-to-kill. Had they done so, given what had happened, the vast majority ofpeople would have accepted there was no other choice. Instead the authoritiesare insistent this did not happen. NORAD told me that F-16s it says werescrambled from Langley to Washington were redirected to check out Flight 93, butwhen the plane crashed into that Shanksville field they were still 11 minutes,or 100 miles, from making contact.45 Shucks, missed again. Or did they? PaulWolfowitz, the Deputy Defense Secretary, said the Pentagon had been trackingFlight 93 and could have shot it down if necessary.46 Eyewitness reports at thetime confirm that Flight 93 was being tracked, but seriously contradict theNORAD claim that the nearest military jet was 100 miles or 11 minutes away atthe time of impact. Reports also put in question the claim that the plane camedown in one piece. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette said:> “Residents and workers at businesses outside Shanksville, Somerset County,> reported discovering clothing, books, papers, and what appear to be human> remains. Some residents said they collected bags-full of items to be turned> over to investigators. Others reported what appeared to be crash debris> floating in Indian Lake, nearly six miles from the crash site.” 47Six miles from the crash site with only a ten miles an hour wind blowing?Reuters reported Pennsylvania state police as saying that debris from the planehad been found up to eight miles away in a residential community “where localmedia have quoted residents as speaking of a second plane in the area andburning debris falling from the sky”.48 Time magazine for the week of 9/11reported that the “largest pieces of the plane still extant are barely biggerthan a telephone book”. Again, look at the very large pieces of wreckage thatwere left on the ground when the cargo and passenger aircraft collided at 36,000feet in July 2002. ABC News reported that an eyewitness called Linda Shepley hadtold television station KDKA in Pittsburgh that she “heard a loud bang and sawthe plane bank to the side before crashing”. Other witnesses said they heard upto three loud booms before the jetliner went down.49 Danny Butler wrote in theHerald Sun: “Witnesses reported eerie sounds from the aircraft as it fell. Somepeople heard an explosion, and others heard sputtering.” 50 A local Pennsylvanianewspaper, the Daily American, reported the experience of another witness:> “Laura Temyer of Hooversville RD1 was hanging her clothes outside to dry> before she went to work Tuesday morning when she heard what she thought was an> airplane. ‘Normally I wouldn’t look up, but I just heard on the news that all> the planes were grounded and thought this was probably the last one I would> see for a while, so I looked up,’ she said. ‘I didn’t see the plane but I> heard the plane’s engine. Then I heard a loud thump that echoed off the hills> and then I heard the plane’s engine. I heard two more loud thumps and didn’t> hear the plane’s engine anymore after that.’” 51The National Guard cordoned off the crash area and it was many hours before anytelevision footage was shown and then only from a distance. Lyle Szupinka of theState Police said that one of the large engines from the aircraft was found “ata considerable distance from the crash site”. He added:> “If you were to go down there, you wouldn’t know that was a plane crash. You> would look around and say, ‘I wonder what happened here?’ The first impression> looking around you wouldn’t say, ‘Oh, looks like a plane crash. The debris is> very, very small. The best I can describe it is if you’ve ever been to a> commercial landfill. When it’s covered and you have papers flying around. You> have papers blowing around and bits and pieces of shredded metal. That’s> probably about the best way to describe that scene itself.” 52The Pentagon told the New York Times that Flight 93 was being followed by anF-14 with an order from President Bush to shoot down the plane if necessary. TheTelegraph newspaper that circulates in Nashua and Southern New Hampshire quoteda “Federal Aviation Administration employee who works in the Nashua controlfacility” as saying that air traffic controllers there had learned throughdiscussions with other controllers that an F-16 fighter stayed in hot pursuit ofFlight 93 until it crashed. Although controllers didn’t have complete details,they had learned that the F-16 made 360-degree turns to remain close to theplane, the employee said. “He must’ve seen the whole thing.” 53 The first mediareports (often the most accurate before the lid goes on) said the plane had beenshot down, and USA Today reported how local residents said they had seen asecond plane in the area, possibly an F-16 fighter, and burning debris fallingfrom the sky. “[FBI Agent] Crowley said investigators had determined that twoother planes were nearby but didn’t know if either was military,” said thepaper.54 Then there was the call taken from the plane by Glenn Cramer, a localemergency dispatcher at the Westmoreland County Emergency Operations Center. Hereported that a passenger who said he was in a locked toilet on Flight 93 calledthe emergency number 911 at 9.58 to say the plane had been hijacked. Cramersaid: “He heard some sort of explosion and saw white smoke coming from theplane, and we lost contact with him.” 55 Soon afterwards the plane went down.How he saw all this while locked in a toilet is not clear, however. TheWashington Post reported that FBI agents quickly took possession of the tape ofthat call and refused to provide any information about the tape’s contents orthe identity of the caller. Another report said: “[Westmoreland Countyspokesman] Stephens said the passenger gave the dispatcher information about thesituation on the plane, but said the FBI has ordered details not to bereleased.” 56 The idea that this was caused by a hijacker bomb doesn’t stand up.Why would the hijackers take such a risk of detection by taking a bomb on theplane, especially when none of the others are suggested to have done so? FBIspokesman Bill Crowley denied that a bomb was involved. He said: “The conclusionof the investigation is that no explosives were used on board the plane.” 57Even CNN noted the discrepancies when correspondent Brian Cabell reported fromthe scene in Pennsylvania on September 13th:> “… in the last hour or so, the FBI and the state police here have confirmed> that they have cordoned off a second area about six to eight miles away from> the crater here where [the] plane went down. This is apparently another debris> site, which raises a number of questions. Why would debris from the plane –> and they identified it specifically as being from this plane – why would> debris be located six miles away? Could it have blown that far away? It seems> highly unlikely. Almost all the debris found at this site is within 100 yards,> 200 yards, so it raises some questions.” 58Which were subsequently never asked and never investigated.The mystery “white jet”Another aspect of the Flight 93 story that has conveniently been forgotten andignored is the small white jet seen by residents at the time of the crash. Inits edition of September 14th 2001, the Record in Bergen County, New Jersey,quoted five people who live and work less than four miles from the crash site.Susan Custer said she saw a small white jet streaking overhead and then “heardthe boom and saw the mushroom cloud”. Robin Doppstadt was working inside herfamily food-and-supply store when she heard the crash and when she went outsideshe saw a small white jet that “looked like it was making a single circle overthe crash site”. She said it climbed very quickly and took off. “It’s thedamndest darn thing,” said farmer Dale Browning. “Everybody’s seen this thing inthe sky, but no one can tell us what it is.” Susan Mcelwain of StonycreekTownship said a small white jet with rear engines and no discernible markingsswooped low over her minivan, almost clipped the tops of trees, and disappearedover a hilltop. Within a minute, she said, the ground shook and a white plume ofsmoke appeared over the ridge. “It was so close to me I ducked,” Mcelwainrecalled, “I heard it [Flight 93] hit and saw the smoke. All I could think ofwas how close I came to dying.” 59 Dennis Decker and Rick Chaney said they heardan explosion and ran outside to see a large mushroom cloud spreading over theridge. “As soon as we looked up, we saw a mid-sized jet flying low and fast,”Decker said. “It appeared to make a loop or part of a circle, and then it turnedfast and headed out.” They said the plane was something like a Learjet and waswhite with no markings that they could see. “If you were here to see it, you’dhave no doubt,” Decker said. “It was a jet plane, and it had to be flying realclose when that 757 went down. If I was the FBI, I’d find out who was drivingthat plane.” The FBI did not appear to want to, however, which will surprise noone.The FBI said it did not rule out a second plane, but then did exactly that. Anofficial at the Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center in Oberlin, Ohio, whichtracked Flight 93, said “no comment” when asked if there was any record of asecond plane over the crash site. “That’s something that the FBI is working onand I cannot talk about,” said Richard Kettel, head of tower operations at theCleveland Center.60 Small white jets like the one described are used by the USmilitary. One is the T-1A Jayhawk, a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer, anda military version of the Beech 400A. It is powered by twin rear engines capableof an operating speed of 539 miles per hour and has a range of 2,100 nauticalmiles.61 Clearly, as with every other aspect of the 9/11 story, there is a greatdeal we are not being told and I believe that knowing why Flight 93 crashed in afield while the others were left to complete the job unchallenged will tell usan enormous amount about how these atrocities were organised. A websitespecialising in the investigation of Flight 93 summarises the situation verywell:> “At this point, if a new story comes out – even if it comes with a recording –> that shows heroes in the cockpit, I think we all have a right to be skeptical> of its accuracy. I have a digital audio studio at home. I, and anyone else> familiar with audio these days, can tell you anything can be created. No> matter what information is released in the future, skeptics of the hero story> have been given all the ammo they need by the FBI to remain skeptical forever.> That ammo is silence, time and the failure to discuss witnessed events like> the mystery white jet at tree top level before the crash, the wide debris> field, the detached engine, the explosions heard by so many and the data> recorders.” 62My own feeling after many months of studying the background is that all theplanes were probably supposed to crash much closer in time to each other thanthey did. If the unexplained delay of 40 minutes between Flight 93 leaving thegate at Newark and actually taking off was not planned for some reason, thiscould well have scuppered the timeline. NORAD says that Flight 93 crashed atabout 10.03 and, if you look at a map, the location is less than 30 minutesflying time from Washington. In fact, at 500miles an hour the 124 miles would becompleted in little more than half that time. Let’s say it would have taken 20minutes. Even with its delayed departure that would put Flight 93 overWashington by about 10.25 if it had not crashed. Take away the 40-minute delaybefore departure at Newark and you would have Flight 93 arriving over Washingtonin the region of 9.45 to 9.50. Flight 77 (or something) struck the Pentagon at9.38 and both could easily have been scheduled to strike earlier. It is verypossible that Flight 93 and 77 were supposed to hit Washington quite close toeach other, as with the two planes in New York that crashed about 20 minutesapart. The target for 93 might have been Capitol Hill, both for its symbolismand because destroying the home of Congress and the Senate would have handedalmost complete control to President Bush in that crucial period. But, againstthat, General Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says he was onCapitol Hill that morning with Senator Max Cleland. If that’s true it makes itunlikely that this was the target. The White House is another obviouspossibility. If Flight 93 was heading for Washington, and it was genuinelydelayed before take off, it would explain why it was the only one not to strikeits target. Once Flight 77 hit the Pentagon, or we were told it did, there wasno longer a credible story left to explain how a fourth plane, Flight 93, couldhave arrived some considerable time after that to strike another target withouta response from the military. Therefore, it would follow that the best way tosolve the problem would be to shoot it down and concoct a cover story that heropassengers challenged the hijacker pilots. I am open to all possibility, butthat is certainly one, and I understand there were other events planned that daythat didn’t happen because of panic and incompetence. However, I think there issomething of great significance about Flight 93 that we don’t yet know and,until we do, its true background will remain speculation. Maybe Washington wasnot the target at all and it was following a very different agenda.“Investigations” you can trustWe cannot hope for the authorities to tell us the truth. That is not what theyare there for. The “investigations” into plane crashes, including the Lockerbiebombing quite wrongly blamed on Libya, are fixed to suit the official line andhide what really happened. When TWA Flight 800 crashed shortly after take offfrom New York on July 17th 1996, the official report by the NationalTransportation Safety Board claimed it was caused by an explosion in a fuel tankthat was traced to a fuel pump. Yes, that’s probably partly correct in one sensebecause fuel tanks do tend to explode when missiles hit them. Jim Sanders, aninvestigative journalist and the husband of a TWA flight attendant, workedtenaciously to expose the lies of the FBI. In retaliation, Sanders, his wife anda TWA captain were arrested by the FBI for impeding its “investigation”. Sanderswent to jail for his trouble, but produced a book and documentary after hisrelease.63 He acquired samples of seat covers from the plane, which were stainedby a reddish residue and when he sent them for analysis to Morton Thiokol andHughes Aerospace, the laboratories reported that the residue contained 15chemicals found in anti-aircraft missiles and only one of them – glue – is foundin aircraft seat covers.64 But even though pilots from the Air National Guardreported seeing a missile strike Flight 800, as did some 250 other people, andeven though pictures existed of the missile and the remote-controlled flyingdrone it was supposed to have hit, the FBI, the organisation telling you whathappened on September 11th, covered up the whole story with the help of the Navywho took control of the crash scene instead of the usual civilian crashinvestigators. Richard Russell, a retired airline pilot, acquired the FederalAviation Administration radar tapes of the incident, which revealed an objecttravelling at up to 2,000 miles an hour heading directly at the plane. WhenRussell said he would circulate the tape it was seized by the FBI.65 Somethingto ponder here. This means that the FAA knew that Flight 800 was struck by somesort of missile, but kept quiet about it and allowed the FBI cover story tobecome the official “history”. That is precisely what has happened in the 9/11case. The FAA knows the official version is nonsense, but it is keeping quietagain and helping the FBI concoct the Big Lie.Another interesting point about Flight 800 is the remotely controlled “drone”connection that has not been widely publicised. In the spring of 1997 theSouthampton Press told the story of Dede Muma, a resident of Riverhead, LongIsland, who was mistakenly sent faxes of official documents related to thefederal TWA Flight 800 investigation. Her fax number was very close to the onebeing used for faxes related to the investigation by the FBI and other personnelon Long Island. The cover sheet Dede Muma received indicated it was from aworker at Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical in San Diego to a co-worker helping the FBIon Long Island. Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical is operated by theIlluminati-controlled Northrop Grumman. This is the company behind the GlobalHawk remote control aircraft technology. The multiple fax pages detailed therear structures of the “Firebee” drone aircraft that Teledyne Ryan manufacturesfor the US military. The FBI claims it was told by the US Coast Guard that thebright orange debris that was found with the debris of Flight 800 was fromfishing and boating floats. But here was a fax in May 1997 that revealed how theFBI was asking experts from Teledyne Ryan – makers of a bright orange-redremotely controlled plane for the US military – to identify this mysterydebris.66 Again these official “investigations” are designed to hide the truth,not reveal it.Controlled demolition?The major Illuminati player David Rockefeller and his brother Nelson, the fourtimes governor of New York, were the men behind the building of the World TradeCenter through the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Rockefellerswanted to name the towers after themselves, but Mayor John Lindsay apparentlyinsisted on the World Trade Center. The twin towers were massive structures.They were 1,368 feet (417 metres) tall and had 110 storeys. Each floor wasapproximately 210 feet by 210 feet in size. Architect Minoru Yamasaki built theWTC to a revolutionary design with its main supports on the outside. Work beganin 1965 and the towers were opened in the early 1970s. Only seven weeks beforethe 9/11 attacks, the World Trade Center changed hands for the first time whenbusinessman Larry Silverstein, who already owned Building Seven on the site, leda consortium that finalised and celebrated a deal for a 99-year lease on thewhole complex, worth $3.2 billion. The deal included new insurance policies withthe added benefit of a pay-out in the event of a terrorist attack, andSilverstein will therefore have the money to rebuild on the same site.One of the most traumatic and defining images of September 11th was the collapseof the twin towers. It led to the biggest loss of firefighters at one incident;the second biggest loss of life on American soil; the first total collapse of ahigh-rise during a fire in United States history; and the largest structuralcollapse in recorded history. As Fire Engineering magazine said, you would thinkthat this would lead to the biggest fire investigation in world history. But no.Francis L. Brannigan, Glenn P. Corbett and Deputy Chief (Ret.) Vincent Dunn,published an article calling for a proper investigation. All we had been given,they said, is a “series of unconnected and uncoordinated superficialinquiries”.67 There has been no comprehensive “Presidential Blue RibbonCommission,” they wrote, “no top-notch National Transportation Safety Board-likeresponse”. Ironically, they went on, we will probably gain more detailedinformation about the destruction of the planes than we will about thedestruction of the towers. “We are literally treating the steel removed from thesite like garbage, not like crucial fire scene evidence,” said the writers. Thisis, of course, precisely what happened with the Oklahoma bomb and police evensaid that some scrap metal from the WTC had been diverted to businessescontrolled by the Mob. Fire Engineering magazine called on FEMA (you must bejoking) to immediately appoint a “World Trade Center Disaster Review Panel” tocoordinate a complete review of all aspects of the World Trade Center incidentand to produce …:> “… A comprehensive report that examines a variety of topics including> determining exactly how and why the towers collapsed, critiquing the building> evacuation procedures and the means of egress, assessing the buildings’ fire> protection features (steel “fireproofing,” fire protection systems) and> reviewing the valiant fire fighting procedures employed.” 68Another publication, Firefighters Magazine, also described the destruction andremoval of evidence from the World Trade Center site as “a half-baked farce” ofinvestigation.69 The editorial was written by Bill Manning, editor of themagazine, which often publishes technical studies of major fires. Manning saidquite rightly that steel from the site should be preserved to allow properinvestigations into the cause of the collapse. He asks:> “Did they throw away the locked doors from the Triangle Shirtwaist fire? Did> they throw away the gas can used at the Happy Land social club fire? … That’s> what they’re doing at the World Trade Center. The destruction and removal of> evidence must stop immediately.”Remember what Ben Partin said when they did the same with the Murrah Building inOklahoma using the same company, Controlled Demolition? Firefighters Magazinepoints out that a growing number of fire protection engineers have suggestedthat “the structural damage from the planes and the explosive ignition of jetfuel in themselves were not enough to bring down the towers.” The New York Timesreported the frustration of experts from the American Society of Civil Engineersappointed by FEMA to “investigate” the cause of the collapse.70 They said thedecision to immediately recycle the steel columns, beams, and trusses may havecost them some of their most direct evidence to explain what happened. DrFrederick W. Mowrer, an associate professor in the fire protection engineeringdepartment at the University of Maryland, said: “I find the speed with whichpotentially important evidence has been removed and recycled to be appalling.”71 The office of 9/11 “hero” Mayor Giuliani would apparently not respond torequests to explain why this was happening and instead put forward Matthew G.Monahan, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Design and Construction, whichwas in charge of debris removal at the site. He said: “The city considered itreasonable to have recovered structural steel recycled.” The New York Timesinterviewed some of the investigation team, among them some of America’s mostrespected engineers. They said they had at various times been “shackled withbureaucratic restrictions” that blocked them from interviewing witnesses,examining the site and requesting crucial information like recorded distresscalls to the police and fire departments. “This is almost the dream team ofengineers in the country working on this, and our hands are tied,” one teammember told the Times and they had been threatened with dismissal for speakingto the media. “FEMA is controlling everything,” the team member said,72 andreaders of this and my other books will well understand why. Here we go again,massive questions, but no open, public investigation. Wherever you look in everyaspect of 9/11 there is suppression of information, questioning and genuineinquiry. Everywhere there is something to hide.The response of most people as they watched those terrible images of the twintowers falling in on themselves is that they resembled the sort of controlleddemolitions that you see on television from time to time. Explosive charges areplaced so expertly that enormous buildings, like skyscrapers and footballstadiums, are collapsed downward and inward, and so protect the surrounding areafrom damage. It was not only the public that thought this. Van Romero, thePresident for Research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology(known as Tech), said after seeing the towers collapse on television that itappeared to be “too methodical” to be a chance result of airplanes collidingwith the structures. “My opinion is, based on the videotapes, that after theairplanes hit the World Trade Center there were some explosive devices insidethe buildings that caused the towers to collapse.” 73 Romero said the collapseresembled the controlled implosions used to demolish old structures and “itwould be difficult for something from the plane to trigger an event like that”.If explosions did cause the towers to collapse, he said, the detonations couldhave been caused by a small amount of explosive placed at strategic points. Hesaid the explosives would likely have been put in more than two points in eachof the towers. Why is my mind wandering back to Oklahoma? Romero should knowwhat he is talking about as a former Director of the Energetic MaterialsResearch and Testing Center in New Mexico, which studies the effects ofexplosions on buildings. Indeed the government must rate him and hisorganisation highly because on September 11th he and another Tech official wereon their way to a building near the Pentagon to discuss defence-funded research.But then, ten days later, after the official story announced that the collapseswere caused by heat softening the steel girders, Romero dramatically changed histune. Now it was the fire and not explosives that was responsible, he said.“Certainly the fire is what caused the building to fail,” he told theAlbuquerque Journal.74 The intense heat of the jet fuel fires weakened the steelstructural beams, which gave way under the weight of the floors above. This setoff a chain reaction, as upper floors pancaked on to lower ones. Romero said hestill believed it was possible that the final collapse of each building wastriggered by “a sudden pressure pulse caused when the fire reached an electricaltransformer or other source of combustion within the building”. I wonder whathappened to Romero in those ten days?The north tower of the World Trade Center was hit at 8.45 and collapsed at10.29, an impact-to-fail time of one hour and 44 minutes. The south tower wasstruck at 9.03 and collapsed at 9.50, an impact-to-fail time of 47 minutes. Thetower struck second collapsed first and took almost an hour less to fail thanthe other one. More than that, the south tower was struck a more glancing blowand, as the world saw, much of the fuel exploded away from the building and notinside. The official story says that this can be explained by the fact that thesouth tower was struck lower and the damaged section was subjected to greaterpressure from the floors above. It is claimed that steel “trusses” holding upthe floors failed as they were undermined by the heat, but for the buildings tohave virtually imploded like a controlled demolition these trusses would havehad to have failed almost simultaneously or one side would have fallen first andcaused a topple-over effect. A big topple over would have relieved the pressureon the floors below and they could not have collapsed as they did. With thesouth tower struck on one side, and thus the most intense fire in that area,would you not expect that this combination would have caused that side to failfirst and caused it to topple over much more than it did? It is true that it didtopple to a certain extent, but the north tower telescoped straight down andMark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, could not explain this.Loizeaux said the south tower, which was hit at about the 60th floor, failedmuch as you would fell a tree. That is what was expected, he said. But the northtower, struck at about the 96th floor, “telescoped” and failed vertically. Askedto explain this he said: “I don’t have a clue.” 75The official explanation of why the towers came down is that the fire was so hotthat the steel became too weak to hold up the weight of the concrete and steelabove it. The steel beams then buckled and/or the joints broke. Then theconcrete and steel crashed down on to the floor below it, turning the concreteinto powder. A chain reaction had started; each floor pulverised the one belowit. But we are told that the 47-storey Building Seven on the World Trade Centersite also collapsed around 6pm that day because of fire and yet this was notstruck by a plane or subjected to an aviation fuel explosion. Also, LeeRobertson, the structural engineer who designed the towers, told aninternational coalition on terrorism in Frankfurt, Germany, a week before theattacks that they were designed to withstand a hit by a Boeing 707 commercialjet and this carried about as much fuel as a 757 and 767.76 Another WTCarchitect, Aaron Swirski, lives in Israel and spoke to Jerusalem Post Radioafter the attack. He said the buildings were “designed around that eventualityto survive this kind of attack”.77 The melting point of steel is 1,538 degreesCelsius or 2,800 Fahrenheit, and although it would not have had to reach this tofail we are talking a serious temperature in a building of some 200,000 tons ofsteel. This is significant because when heat is applied it moves outward throughthe steel and this helps to cool down the source point by carrying heat away.Structural engineer G. Charles Clifton said: “In my opinion, based on availableevidence, there appears no indication that the fires were as severe as a fullydeveloped multi-story fire in an initially undamaged building would typicallybe.” 78 Scientist and researcher Brian Desborough makes the following commentson the official story:> “Unlike most high-rise buildings, which possess flimsy curtain walling> exterior panels, the outer walls of the twin towers contained a multiplicity> of very strong and closely-spaced square-sectioned steel beams. These vertical> structural box beams would have absorbed a great deal of the impact energy of> the collision.> “An aspect of the 9/11 disaster which I’m well qualified to comment on is the> claim that the burning fuel weakened the tower’s structural steelwork> sufficiently to cause subsequent building collapse. The structural steelwork> of a high-rise has to be either encapsulated with concrete or covered with a> fire retardant coating. When I was technical director of a chemical company, I> personally developed several such coatings. In general, the coating has to> prevent the steel from attaining a temperature of 1100 degrees Fahrenheit or> it will result in a catastrophic failure. Fire codes vary in different> localities, but in general it takes at least one hour for such structural> steelwork to attain an elevated temperature of 1100 F.> “Note that the south tower was impacted by the plane at a very oblique angle,> causing much of the fuel load to be dumped outside the tower, hence the huge> external fireball.

It is reasonable,> therefore, to have expected the Trade Center towers to have maintained> sufficient structural integrity to have withstood the aircraft impact and> resultant fires.” 79On August 4th 2002, almost a year after the towers collapsed, the New York Timesrevealed the existence of a tape recording of communications by firefighters whohad reached the 78th floor of the south tower. This was just two floors belowthe main impact and the 78th floor was actually struck by a wing of Flight 175.New York fire officials said they had “delayed listening” to the tape (what fornearly a year?) and had continued during that period to say that no firefighterwent higher than the 50th floor. The tape is devastating to the official storybecause the Times described how Battalion Chief Orio J. Palmer is heard calmlyorganising the evacuation of survivors with Fire Marshall Ronald P. Bucca andthe extinguishing of only “two pockets of fire” that they could see. Yet we aretold that just above them, at the very same time, the building was reachingfantastic temperatures that, the official tale claims, caused the building tocollapse shortly after these communications by Chief Palmer. It’s fairyland.We have already seen how expert Romero said that very little explosive would beneeded to bring down the towers so long as it was placed in the right locations.Many witnesses at the time reported hearing explosions before the buildingscollapsed. Firefighter Louie Cacchioli, who was assigned to Engine 47 in Harlem,said his crew were the first to enter the second tower after it was hit. He saidhe was taking firefighters in the elevator to the 24th floor to support theevacuation. On his last trip, he said, a bomb went off. “We think there werebombs set in the building,” he said. “I had just asked another firefighter tostay with me, which was a good thing because we were trapped inside the elevatorand he had the tools to get out.” 80 Six months after the attacks in March 2002,CBS broadcast a television documentary of what happened that day using thefootage of firefighters taken by two French brothers.81 They had been shootingtheir own documentary on September 11th near the World Trade Center featuringthe firefighters of the Engine 7, Ladder 1, of the New York Fire Departmentbased a few blocks away from the WTC. Suddenly the film-makers found themselvesinvolved in a very different documentary and it was they who caught the firstplane hitting the north tower, which George Bush claimed to have seen live, butcould not have done. When the fire crew and cameraman Jules Naudet arrived atthe north tower they were astonished to find that the lobby, 96 floors belowimpact, had suffered widespread damage. This was later explained away byofficials who said that burning jet fuel had poured down the elevator shafts andexploded in the lobby. But there was no evidence of burning or incendiaryexplosion in the lobby area. “The lobby looked like the plane hit the lobby!”one firefighter said.82 After the event the experts were wheeled out to explainwhy it was obvious the buildings would collapse because of the fire, but thiswas clearly not considered a potential problem by the New York fire chiefs whohave enormous experience of the potential dangers in the high-rise buildings inthat city, none of which have ever failed in this way. Far from clearing thetowers in case of collapse they set up their operations command post in thelobby of the north tower. Had that collapsed first they would all have beenkilled because it was only when the south tower came down that the possibilitywas even considered.83 Hundreds of firefighters were sent up the stairways totheir deaths because the collapse of the towers was not even taken intoconsideration. Why was this if, according to the “experts” afterwards, it was soobvious why they collapsed? Then there is the story of the security officer atthe World Trade Center, told to Peter Jennings on ABC television. The officersaid that after the south tower had collapsed he had received a call from theNew York Port Authority Command Center on the 22nd floor asking for a rescue inthe north tower.84 He went there himself with firefighters and they found thatthe offices were so devastated that they had to “tunnel through debris” to “digout” the trapped Port Authority employees. Remember these offices were some 70floors below the impact point of the aircraft. The 22nd, 23rd and 24th floorswere also said to contain offices leased to the FBI.85 It was here, it isclaimed, that they are said to have kept the files on the cases against MobilOil and James Giffen involving alleged illegal oil swaps between Iran andKazakhstan and against Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, Morgan and Company,and Goldman Sachs involving gold price fixing. The basements of the World TradeCenter contained vast vaults used by the COMEX metals trading division of theNew York Mercantile Exchange. Some 3,800 gold bars, weighing 12 tons and worthmore than $100 million, were buried under the mountains of rubble left after theattack. I asked the FBI if it had offices on those floors of the World TradeCenter, but my question was not answered.Beam weapons?It is possible that charges were placed in the buildings at crucial points andexploded by remote control, but we should remember that the Illuminati are notworking only with the technology we see in the public domain. They have accessto their secret science, and the development of weapons and other technologythat is far in advance of anything we see. One example is the energy-particle or“beam” weapon that fires an invisible laser or sound wave so powerful it canturn a building to dust. It has been noted by a number of observers that debriswas turning to dust as it fell through the air and not only when it struck theground. The television evangelist Dr Robert Schuller said after visiting thesite that there “was not a single block of concrete in that rubble” 86 Some425,000 cubic yards of concrete disintegrated, most of it into immense clouds ofdust. Dr Charles Hirsch, the Chief Medical Examiner, reportedly told grievingrelatives in December 2001 that many bodies had been “vaporized”.87 By then only500 of the estimated 3,000 had been identified and a report on the BBC in lateMay 2002 when the clear-up had been completed said only a third of the bodieshad been discovered. Dr Hirsch declined to be interviewed, but his spokeswomanEllen Borakove said he meant that bodies were consumed by blazing fuel or“rendered into dust” when the buildings collapsed. Dr Michael Baden, New York’sChief Forensic Pathologist, had said in September that most bodies should beidentifiable because the fires had not reached the 3,200 degrees for 30 minutesnecessary to incinerate an entire body. An eyewitness to the collapse told theAmerican Free Press that as he stood two blocks from the World Trade Center hehad seen “a number of brief light sources being emitted from inside the buildingbetween floors 10 and 15”. He saw about six of these brief flashes, accompaniedby a “crackling sound” immediately before the tower collapsed. This may or maynot be relevant. The point I am making is that we need to realise that thetechnology exists to undermine the buildings using the Illuminati’s secretscience.The American Free Press interviewed a German physicist who believes a laser beamweapon could have caused the collapse of the twin towers using infraredtechnology that was first developed in the Soviet Union.88 The physicist, whomthe American Free Press does not name, was described as a former East Germanphysicist who studied Soviet infrared technology and plasmoids during the 1960sand 1970s, and was directly involved in the demonstration of a Soviet laser beamweapon for the US Air Force in Weimar in 1991. He was quoted as saying there isevidence that a directed-energy weapon using “deep infrared” radiation was usedto bring down the World Trade Center. According to the physicist, the Sovietinfrared beam weapon was used during a Soviet dispute with China in 1969 todestroy “a wall” at the Ussuri River, which separates Manchuria from Russia.Infrared radiation employs invisible wavelengths between visible light andmicrowave on the electromagnetic spectrum and produces enormous heat. It createsa potentially devastating phenomenon called a plasmoid cloud of heated andionised gas, AFP reported. The rubble of the World Trade Center, which was asteel and concrete construction, burned for more than three months despitehaving been sprayed with a nearly constant jet of water.89 The United States hasbeen developing and deploying such weapons for many years, and one of itscentres of development has been the Brookhaven Laboratories on Long Island, NewYork. Lasers are the leading edge of directed-energy weapons. Author Jeff Hecht,wrote in his 1984 book Beam Weapons: The Next Arms Race: “The military‘destructor beam’ definitely is in our future tactical arsenal.” The advancedtechnology and plasma physics involved in directed-energy weapons give themunprecedented lethal power. They can unleash devastating beams of energy inseconds and less. The German physicist told the American Free Press:> “From my experience as a physicist and research scientist with the GRU> [Russia’s Central Intelligence Agency] I have enough experience to judge that> the World Trade towers have been burning too quickly, too hot, and too> completely to have been caused by the kerosene fires that resulted from the> crashes. Furthermore, the demolished buildings nearby are an indication that> there was a plasmoid cloud involved, which probably affected the buildings> nearby.”He said that in 1991 the GRU demonstrated for the US Air Force ElectronicSecurity Command (AFESC) the capabilities of its infrared beam weapon byreducing a ceramic plate to dust from a distance of one mile. He said thedemonstration was designed to show the US “how a stealth bomber could be turnedinto dust in the same way”. The plate had been turned into such fine dust, hesaid, that it was difficult to pick up with a vacuum cleaner. “The plate was notdestroyed suddenly as if hit by a bullet, rather it disintegrated in a processtaking about 15 minutes.” The physicist said that one of the transmittersinvolved in striking the World Trade Center with a beam weapon could have beenlocated in a high building nearby or on a satellite, plane, or ship.Keep taking the tablets, Mr PresidentSoon after the attacks we had the anthrax scare, which was designed to furtherspread fear and outrage among the people as Bush and Co sought to rally publicopinion behind a “war on terrorism”. A photo editor at The Sun newspaper in BocaRaton, Florida, died after inhaling anthrax and two other employees testedpositive. Letters containing anthrax were then sent to a number of prominentpeople, including Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and NBC News anchorman TomBrokaw. A total of 29 people were reported to have tested positive for exposureto anthrax in the Senate, including Daschle aides and two Capitol policeofficers. Capitol Hill was closed for a week – just as Bush was pushing aheadwith his Patriot Act and the “war on terrorism”. Some White House personnel weregiven Cipro, the anthrax antibiotic, six weeks before the letters began toappear and on the night of the September 11th attacks, the White House MedicalOffice dispensed Cipro to staff accompanying Vice President Dick Cheney.90 Thatclearly means that Cheney and Bush were given them also, but the White Houserefuses to discuss that. Spokesman Ari “We got a warning that Air Force One wasnext” Fleischer said: “If the White House were to start to reveal the securitymeasures including health protections that are in place for the president …people who would want to do harm to the president would know what protectionsare in place and therefore they could shift their tactics.” 91 Or, without thenewspeak: “If the White House were to start to reveal the security measuresincluding health protections that are in place for the president … people wouldknow the anthrax scare was a sham.”American Media Inc., the owner of The Sun where the photo editor died fromcontact with anthrax, has reported connections to the CIA. Boca Raton,headquarters of the Sun, is a major Illuminati enclave and home to a plant ownedby Product Ingredient Technology, a company with links to Father George Bushthat, it is claimed, manufactured chemical warfare agents exported to Iraq withUS government approval in the late 1980s ahead of the Gulf War.92 A man calledPeter Kawaja said in an American radio interview that he was involved at onetime with Product Ingredient Technology in Boca Raton and with Ishan BarboutiInternational (IBI), the builder of Pharma 150, the chemical and biologicalweapons complex in Rabta, Libya.93 His experiences led him to investigate whatwas going on. He said he went to the CIA and FBI, and operated for the USgovernment under a code name. They told him the people he was investigating wereinternational terrorists and they were going to prosecute them. Kawaja said thathe continued with his own investigation, however, which included “buggingtelephone lines, buildings, and certain other locations throughout the UnitedStates.” 94 This was when, as I mentioned earlier, he says he interceptedcommunications to the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Banca Nazionale delLavorro (BNL), which was publicly exposed as a vehicle for funding SaddamHussein from the United States. Kawaja said he saw the letters of credit of theBNL, which came from Switzerland, and “a lot of other communications regardingthe Gulf War that was to come”. He said he recorded calls going to and comingfrom Baghdad, to and from the United States and London, CIA, FBI, FBIcounter-intelligence, US Customs, certain politicians and numerous otherindividuals. “This is my information,” he said in the radio interview. “It isnot second-hand.” He said that what he found at the Product IngredientTechnology in Boca Raton was “very heinous”. He said he found that a strain ofhydrogen cyanide called Prussian Blue was being tested on gas mask filters morethan a year before the Gulf War and that this information was known to the thenPresident of the United States, Father George Bush. He said that the Gulf Warillnesses are actually communicable diseases and they are on gas masks,clothing, weapons and any of the materials that came back from the Gulf War. Hesaid he had reports from several states where civilians have bought some of theclothing and now their entire family are in wheelchairs. Quite a coincidence,therefore, that the anthrax scare should start in Boca Raton.Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle told reporters that tests found the lettersent to him contained a very potent form of anthrax that was clearly produced bysomeone who knew what he or she was doing. It was found to be of the Ames strainof anthrax and the US Army Laboratory was revealed to be the main source of thisstrain. It was distributed to a handful of laboratories in the United States,Canada and the UK.95 These included the Defence Research Establishment Suffield,a Canadian biodefence institute; the US Army Dugway Proving Ground in the Utahdesert and the Pentagon’s leading chemical and biological testing center; theChemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down, a biodefence institute nearSalisbury, England; University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, aPentagon-funded Albuquerque research institute; Martin E. Hugh-Jones, an anthraxresearcher at Louisiana State University; Northern Arizona University inFlagstaff; and the Battelle Memorial Institute, a major government contractor inColumbus, Ohio. Colonel Arthur Friedlander, senior military research scientistat the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at FortDetrick, Maryland, said the Ames strain was distributed by the military forresearch purposes under strict controls to “legitimate workers in the field”.96So, yet another coincidence. The strain used in the anthrax scare was the oneused by the Pentagon and a few Pentagon-connected laboratories. Funnily enough,after this was revealed, the anthrax scare suddenly ended as fast as it hadbegun. Oh yes, two other coincidences. Cipro, the drug taken after possiblecontact with anthrax or as a precaution, is made by the German Illuminaticompany, Bayer, which was once part of Hitler’s I.G. Farben, the chemical giantthat ran the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Sales of Cipro obviously soaredduring the “scare”. BioPort, the exclusive producer of anthrax vaccine for theUS government, is reported to be closely connected with the Carlyle Group ofFather George Bush and its investors, the bin Laden family. In June 2002, BoyGeorge Bush signed new “bio-terrorism” laws that devote $4.3 billion tostockpiling vaccines, food inspections and security for water supplies. Oneguess whose pockets that is heading for.Weaving the webObviously I can’t say in precise detail how the events of September 11th andtheir aftermath were pulled off. Were there hijackers on the planes? Were theyon some and not others? Were they on all of them? Was the Pentagon crash evencaused by a plane? Were the aircraft remotely controlled? Were they flown byhijacker-pilots? Were they flown by hijackers who reprogrammed the route via theFlight Management System? At this stage it cannot be said for sure because toknow the exact details we need to have someone on the inside who knows the fullstory and has the courage to speak out. But what we do know is that if hijackersflew those planes they were brilliant pilots and certainly not the ones named bythe FBI who attended flying schools in the US. That is a total diversion to takepeople off the path and has been orchestrated by those who are reallyresponsible. We also know that the official story is a monumental lie at almostevery turn and I have identified the structure through which apparentlyunconnected countries and agencies can be coordinated to work to the same goal,the same “terrorist” attacks and their subsequent “response”. That structure isthe compartmentalised pyramids I highlighted at the start of this book.The Illuminati manipulate through these “need to know” compartments to ensurethat those necessary for the plan to work are only allowed to know enough forthem to make their individual contribution. They have no idea what is happeningin the other “compartments”. Only the very few at the top, the peak of theIlluminati hierarchy, know how it all fits together. Even people like PresidentBush will be locked in their particular compartment and won’t know the fullstory. A radio interviewer once asked me: “So you’re saying that President Bushorganised the whole thing?” I think it was about a week before I stoppedlaughing. The structure of pyramids inside bigger pyramids, inside still biggerpyramids, makes the coordination possible. The CIA, for example, is acompartmentalised pyramid; so is the FBI; the State Department; the JusticeDepartment; the US Military; al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups; Pakistanintelligence; British intelligence; the UK government; the media; and so on. Atiny few people within these organisations will know what really happened onSeptember 11th and what the Illuminati agenda really involves. Most will have noidea that the Illuminati agenda even exists. They will follow orders from abovewithout knowing where those orders truly originate and why. Only those in thekey positions of power and control within those organisations and countries willknow anything like the real story.However, if you go high enough in the CIA pyramid and those of the FBI, USmilitary, government and media, these pyramids are encompassed by a biggerpyramid. At that level a coordinated plan can be operated through all of themwhile the vast majority of those involved lower down have no idea what they arebeing used for. At this level, the CIA is the FBI is the US government is thecontrolling level of the US media, etc. This means that the CIA, FBI, USgovernment, military and the media can be coordinated to achieve a common goal.They can hatch and organise the attacks, allow them to happen by thwartinginvestigations and exposure and then cover up what happened, again by thwartinginvestigations, destroying evidence and ignoring, jailing or killing witnesses.This is why those genuine FBI agents had their investigations blocked as theyalways do if they threaten to get in the way of a covert operation by theIlluminati and the FBI leadership. In the same way the Pakistan government andintelligence operation are compartmentalised pyramids, as are al-Qaeda and otherterrorist networks; so are German intelligence, Mossad and Saudi Arabia. Again,if you go high enough they are all encompassed by a bigger pyramid, from whichone plan can be coordinated through them. Go still higher and there is a pyramidthat encompasses the one involving Pakistan, al-Qaeda, and the rest, and the oneinvolving the CIA, FBI, US and UK governments, the US and UK military and themedia (Figure 24). From this exalted capstone, or master pyramid, it is possibleto coordinate actions taken by al-Qaeda, Pakistan and German intelligence, etc.and those governments and agencies in the US and UK. A superb symbolic pictureof this hidden hand can be found Michael Mott’s book, Caverns, Cauldrons, andConcealed Creatures97 (Figure 25). The scene happening on the stage is the“movie” I talk about, the version of events given to us hour by hour by themainstream media. But the force holding the strings of both “sides” is neverexposed and, apart from books like this one, the people are never told where thereal power lies and to what end. They keep watching the movie and believing itto be real. This is how it was possible to coordinate and cover up the 9/11atrocities and the main focus of this operation was not in a cave inAfghanistan, but among shadowy groups in the United States and the Britain whocontrol puppets and lackeys like President Bush.image [../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 24: The Russian doll, pyramid-within-pyramid system that allows one forceto manipulate all “sides” Some observationsThe Illuminati’s method of operation would have ensured that the would-behijackers operated in a compartment of knowledge that led them to believe onething while a very different scenario was being planned behind the scenes. Oncethe “hijack” was under way they would have realised that they were not incontrol of the planes at all, but some external force was – remote control. Theexternal control of the planes from the ground is something virtually everycontact I have spoken with is agreed upon. This scenario allowed those reallyresponsible for 9/11 to have Arab men in the right place at the right time tobuild the cover story of “al-Qaeda did it” while behind this compartmentalisedsmoke screen a very different operation unfolded. People like ZacariasMoussaoui, if he was truly involved, may genuinely believe that they wereplanning attacks on behalf of al-Qaeda, but all the while a hidden hand wouldhave been using them as a cover for the real deal. I believe the FBI agents whonow complain that their investigations were blocked before 9/11 were in dangerof exposing, and therefore destroying, the “al-Qaeda” cover story and that iswhy the higher-ups stepped in. The same with the actions of President Bush tostop FBI agents investigating Osama bin Laden and his family in the monthsbefore the attacks. We should not forget either that we still don’t know whothese “hijackers” really were because many of those named by the FBI are stillalive and we have still not been presented with any credible evidence that therest of them were on the planes either.image [../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 25: The Movie. On the stage is what we see every day in the media. Abovethe stage is what is really going on. Control both “sides” and you control thegame I contacted Monnica Sepulveda, a professional psychic in the United States, whohas a very impressive reputation for contacting loved ones that have died.98Making this contact is not mumbo-jumbo, it is basic physics. When consciousnessleaves the body at “death” it leaves this five-sense frequency range, that’sall, because it no longer has a body to operate in this realm of frequency. Itsimply moves its focus to another frequency state and can therefore be accessedand communicated with by those with the ability to move their psychic “radiodial” to attune with it. I asked Monnica if she could make any contact withthose who died on September 11th. She had not followed the 9/11 story muchbeyond the mainstream media and she was very surprised by much of what she wasreceiving – including the fact, she said, that she could see an explosion at thePentagon, but no plane. She said she had made contact with Mohamed Atta, who shewas sure was on the “other side”:> “Wow, you know what, he’s not at all happy with what’s happening with him. He> doesn’t seem to be a happy man about his crossing. There’s something about> lies. OK, he’s making it a little clearer to me … I’m going to use an example> because I know you’ll understand it. You know how you have members of> Freemasons and they have different degrees? That’s how he’s explaining it to> me. It’s like people at the bottom don’t know everything and they’re not privy> to knowing what’s on the top. That’s how I’m getting it from him. God my> stomach. And I think that’s what bothered him. He thought it was under the> guise of one thing, but it’s actually something else. So it’s big. He says you> are already on the right track about knowing the answer. You already know the> answer. You just need it validated and you already know the answer. It has to> do with a reduction of population, an excuse. He says it’s an excuse, whatever> that means. It’s an excuse. Let me see if I can get clearer than that.> Control. Excuse for control. But reduction of population, I wonder why that> would be?”The population reduction policies of the Illuminati have been detailed in myprevious books and those of other researchers. I am not saying that thisinformation from the “other side” is right or wrong, that’s for everyone todecide for themselves, but what Monnica said certainly fits with the techniquesof compartmentalisation at the heart of Illuminati operations. We can see howthese people operate from the Operation Northwoods documents, as described byauthor James Bamford:> “… the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member> of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on> American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the> high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, DC,> Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit;> planes would be hijacked. Using phoney evidence, all of it would be blamed on> Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer [the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and> his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they> needed to launch their war.”The other 9/11 scenario, which some contacts close to the Illuminati haveclaimed to have happened, is even more challenging to our credulity – that therewere no “hijackers” on the planes at all. They were simply taken over by remotecontrol and flown to their destinations, end of story. This would mean, ofcourse, that all the “phone calls” from the planes had to have been faked. Iwould have to see a great deal more evidence to support this before it couldeven begin to be credibly considered and I certainly have not seen that up tothis point. The technology to fake voices apparently exists and falsecommunications of various kinds are frequently used by intelligence agencies.The technology is available to do amazing things with audio and visual, and wemust keep this in mind when considering the options. Victor Ostrovsky, adefector from Mossad, Israel’s Intelligence Agency, said that a transmitterloaded with pre-recorded messages was planted in Tripoli, Libya, by a Mossadteam to beam out fake communications about bombings and attacks planned byColonel Gaddafi. These were immediately intercepted by the US monitoring networkand convinced officials that Libya was behind the 1986 bombing of a Berlin discoin which a US soldier died.99 In response, President Reagan ordered air attackson Libya and tried to assassinate Gaddafi. 100 Libyan civilians were killed,including Gaddafi’s daughter. Faking phone calls to families is going to be afar more serious challenge, however, and I am not saying for a moment that thisis what happened because the logical reaction is that it did not. It would seemto be a very complicated task and, like I say, I would want to see some seriousevidence before going there. I pass this on for your information only, as withMonnica’s communications. I would, however, add that from my experience“logical” reactions are often not the way to uncover the Illuminati’s method ofoperation. After all, how more fantastic can you get than to convince the worldthat the US went to the moon in 1969 when it was all faked and the “giant stepfor mankind” took place on a movie set on Earth? Staggering, yes, but that’swhat happened, as expert analysis has shown. “Logic” comes from assessing eventsfrom the knowledge base that we have. The Illuminati are coming from a muchhigher level of technological know-how and what may be illogical and far-fetchedto us is perfectly “logical” and straightforward to them. What we can say withcertainty is that the official story is nonsense and “pilots” who struggled tocope with Cessnas at US flying schools did not fly those aircraft into thosebuildings. Another point is that many researchers have been looking for a singleexplanation to cover all four aircraft, but my own feeling is that this was notnecessarily the case.Hide and no seekWherever you look in the 9/11 story there are cover-ups, half-truths and,mostly, blatant lies. This is not the behaviour of people who are telling youwhat really happened on September 11th. It is the behaviour of people who wantto sell you a fairytale and make sure you never know the truth. It is for thisreason that Bush, Cheney and those who control them, have done everything theycan to thwart a legitimate investigation into all elements of 9/11 by whateversource: the CIA, FBI, Congress, everyone. Bush told the United Nations: “Let usnever tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks ofSeptember the 11th.” What he should have said, more accurately, is: “Let usnever tolerate anyone who wants to tell the people the truth of what reallyhappened.” Bush and Cheney personally asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschleto “limit the congressional investigation into the events of Sept. 11,”according to CNN. Cheney met Daschle and “expressed the concern that a review ofwhat happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from theeffort in the war on terrorism”. Daschle confirmed this on the NBC programmeMeet the Press. Democrat Daschle said Cheney called him on January 24th 2002 tourge that there be no inquiry into September 11th and Bush had made a similarrequest on January 28th during a breakfast meeting at the White House. Some3,000 dead people on American soil and they don’t want an inquiry? Bush alsocalled a private meeting with congressional leaders on January 29th 2002 andasked that the House and Senate intelligence committees only look into “thepotential breakdowns among federal agencies that could have allowed theterrorist attacks to occur”, and not to investigate what actually happened. USNational Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, appearing on Fox News Sunday, saidthe administration opposed any probe outside the congressional intelligencecommittees because a war against terrorism was still under way. “We worry aboutanything that would take place outside of the intelligence committees, andindeed, we think the intelligence committees are the proper venue for this kindof review.” Yes, and they’ll keep the lid on, darlin’, eh? As the InternationalHerald Tribune put it: “More than seven months into the world’s largest criminalinvestigation, huge uncertainties persist about the most basic aspects of theplot.” 100The media vilifies individuals who ask the most basic of questions, like theGeorgia Democrat representative Cynthia McKinney. She had only asked for aninvestigation into what the Bush administration knew before September 11th andpointed out that people elected to serve the people were keeping quiet in fearthat their “patriotism” be questioned. She wanted an inquiry into reports thatwarnings by foreign governments to the highest levels of the US government werenot acted upon; the profits made in pre-9/11 trading that revealed priorknowledge; the connections between the Unocal oil company and the Taliban rulersof Afghanistan; the connections between the present government and the CarlyleGroup of Father George Bush; the suggestion by Bush and Cheney thatcongressional investigations into 9/11 should not be a full, in-depth inquiry;the enormous profits made by those close to Bush from the vastly increasedspending on the military. All highly relevant and legitimate questions in aso-called free country, but she was attacked from all sides and accused of being“crazy” and “treacherous”. Bush spokesman Scott McLellan told the WashingtonPost: “The American people know the facts, and they dismiss such ludicrous,baseless views.” No they don’t, and neither statement is true. A Carlyle Groupspokesman called Chris Ullman asked: “Did she say these things while standing ona grassy knoll in Roswell, New Mexico?” No, Mr Ullman, she said them whilehaving the courage to say what her colleagues on Capitol Hill are too gutless tosay. Ari Fleischer, the President’s Press Secretary, used the same “grassyknoll” (Kennedy assassination) line in seeking to dismiss McKinney. Obviouslythat was the agreed song sheet. The Democrat Senator for Georgia, Zell Miller,said McKinney’s comments were “dangerous and irresponsible”. Asking for a properinquiry into the murder of 3,000 people is “dangerous” and “irresponsible”? Onlyfor Bush and the gang. The orchestrated attacks on McKinney’s comments and hercharacter were outrageous, but pathetically predictable. This is how theyoperate. They reward those who serve them (until they have outlived theirusefulness) and seek to destroy those who question. You can judge the right orwrong of your own position by those who oppose you. The National Review wasfounded by the massive Illuminati insider, William F. Buckley, and in theNational Review Online of April 12th 2002, McKinney was labelled “RepresentativeAwful”. Writer Jonah Goldberg said she was suffering from “paranoid,America-hating, crypto-Marxist conspiratorial delusions”. Wow, they really aredesperate to keep the lid on aren’t they?Blueprints of the mindThe Illuminati know that if they keep telling the people the same thing over andover that most will come to believe it. They also know that even most of thosewho question parts of the official story will still find it hard to let go ofthe idea that the foundations of it are true. Adolf Hitler described thistechnique very well when he wrote:> “The masses indulge in petty falsehoods every day, but it would never come> into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths and they are not able to> believe in the possibility of such monstrous effrontery … The bigger the lie,> therefore, the more likely it is to be believed … Besides, even the most> insolent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed> down.” 101Observing the reaction to 9/11, even among many conspiracy researchers, thatlast sentence has come back to me many times: “Even the most insolent lie alwaysleaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down.” It is for thisreason that some people, even many, are open to the fact that Bush and hiscronies were incompetent in their lack of response to warnings of possibleattacks, but they cannot get their minds around the idea that those attacks wereactually planned by elements within the United States and the “response” to themwas already prepared and waiting before they happened. It is too much to handleand, importantly, too much to bear. The thought that people are being ruled andcontrolled by a force of such malevolence is such an assault on their basicsense of security that they would rather close their minds to it. They don’twant to go there. But it is time to have the courage to clear the mind ofpreconceived ideas and emotional defences and look at the evidence. If we don’tdo that the global fascist state is staring us in the face. Victor Hugo oncesaid that there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. It isequally true that there is nothing more imprisoning than an idea we won’t letgo.An excellent Internet article was sent to me that was written by Stephen Gowans,a political activist who lives in Ottawa, Canada, in which he applied all thisto September 11th. He points out, and I have found this myself over and over inmy research, how people take the official story to be basically correct and seekto explain the contractions and anomalies within that story. Gowans gives anexample of “muslim extremists” drinking in bars and strip clubs, and hownewspapers sought to explain this away by the “hijackers seeking cover” andusing the Islamic principle of “taqyya” which “permits Muslims to use allnecessary subterfuge to throw suspicion off their real goals”. The idea thatthese men were not “Islamic fanatics” involved in 9/11 is not even explored.Cowans writes: “The underlying thinking goes, ‘These were the bad guys, noquestion, so if they were doing something that’s inconsistent with what the badguys are supposed to do, there must be some reason.’” He also highlights theunexplored inconsistencies between a “brilliantly executed” terrorist attack andthe obvious incompetence of those who were supposed to have been involved:> “The same characteristic of being at once both brilliant and crafty but stupid> and blundering was attributed to Washington’s last hobgoblins – the Serbs. The> Serbs were said to be crafty and cunning enough to hide the bodies of the> ethnic Albanian Kosovars alleged to have been murdered in the tens of> thousands – a story that began circulating when forensic pathologists couldn’t> find the bodies Washington warned were strewn across Kosovo.

But how were we to> know they were actually the bodies of ethnic Albanians?” 102I offer some advice for people faced with the daily bombardment of conditionedthought spewed out by the system in all its forms. Instead of getting caught inthe irrelevant debates and diversions, take a deep breath, take a step back andlook at it again with an open mind free of preconceived thought. Then you willsee it in a very different light. “My God, it’s all a piece a shit!” Exactly,that’s all it is. The 9/11 story is not just partly a piece a shit. Not evenmostly. It is all a piece a shit. It’s time to get a blank piece of paper andlook at it again without being influenced by anything the official sources sayhappened. They’re lying to us – lying, lying, lying.

In the case of September 11th,we can expect to find evidence that the invasion of Afghanistan was planned longbefore those four planes were hijacked. And, of course, we can. On September18th, before the plan to attack Afghanistan was made public, the former PakistanForeign Secretary Niaz Naik told the BBC’s George Arney that he had beeninformed by American officials at a meeting in Germany two months before, inmid-July, that they planned to invade Afghanistan and remove the Taliban beforethe snows came in mid-October. Arney reported:> “Mr Naik said US officials told him of the plan at a UN-sponsored> international contact group on Afghanistan which took place in Berlin. Mr Naik> told the BBC that at the meeting the US representatives told him that unless> Bin Laden was handed over swiftly America would take military action to kill> or capture both bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar.> “The wider objective, according to Mr Naik, would be to topple the Taliban> regime and install a transitional government of moderate Afghans in its place> – possibly under the leadership of the former Afghan King Zahir Shah. Mr Naik> was told that Washington would launch its operation from bases in Tajikistan,> where American advisers were already in place.” 1Naik also said he was told that Uzbekistan would participate in the operation.The UK Guardian newspaper followed up the story, confirming its substance andadding more detail on September 22nd. The four-day meeting in Berlin hadinvolved senior officials from the United States, Russia, Pakistan and Iran andwas the third in a series of conferences dubbed “brainstorming on Afghanistan”.2Among the participants besides Naik were Tom Simons, the former US Ambassador toPakistan; Lee Coldren, who ran Pakistan, Afghan and Bangladesh Affairs in theState Department until 1997; Karl Inderfurth, a former Assistant Secretary ofState for South Asian Affairs; Abdullah Abdullah, the Foreign Minister of theNorthern Alliance, the Taliban opposition in Afghanistan; Nikolai Kozyrev, theformer Russian Special Envoy to Afghanistan; and Saeed Rajai Khorassani, theformer Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations. Francesc Vendrell, the SpanishDeputy Chief UN representative for Afghanistan, convened the meeting, which theTaliban had refused to attend.Niaz Naik said that an American official had told him that an attack onAfghanistan was imminent. “This time they were very sure,” he said. “They hadall the intelligence and would not miss him this time. It would be aerialaction, maybe helicopter gunships, and not only overt, but from very closeproximity to Afghanistan.” 3 Lee Coldren, head of Pakistan, Afghan andBangladesh Affairs at the State Department up to 1997, admitted: “There was somediscussion of the fact that the United States was so disgusted with the Talibanthat they might be considering some military action”.4 This was a rather sudden“disgust”, as we shall see, and “considering” military action was hardly theword. Military action was a certainty long before any planes were hijacked. TheGuardian quoted “senior diplomatic sources” as saying that these threats ofinvasion were passed to the Taliban by the Pakistan government with the warningthat Osama bin Laden must be handed over if war was to be avoided. Naik saysthat the Taliban had been offered a deal in July 2001 in which they would sharepower in a government of national unity (i.e. suitable to US oil interests). Ifthey had accepted that, he said, they would have received immediateinternational aid. Jean-Charles Brisard, the author of a report for Frenchintelligence on the bin Laden network, put the offer in rather starker terms:“At one moment during the negotiations, the U. S. representatives told theTaliban, ‘either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you undera carpet of bombs’.” 5 What followed these news stories soon after 9/11 was thevery invasion of Afghanistan that Naik said he had been informed about inmid-July. NBC also reported that two days before September 11th, President Bushwas given a “detailed war plan” to dismantle bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network. NBCreported that Bush was given a national security directive to sign for a planthat was “pretty much” the same as the one the United States followed after theattacks. The directive was on Bush’s desk on September 9th, but he did not havea chance to sign it before the attacks, the report said.In their own words …The idea that the “war on terrorism” is about terrorism or that the invasion ofAfghanistan was a reaction to September 11th is cuckoo land. It is part of along-planned strategy that was laid out by Illuminati strategist ZbigniewBrzezinski in his 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard.6 He said that America was“too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad”. This limited the use of USpower, especially its “capacity for military intimidation”. Never before, hesaid, had a populist democracy attained international supremacy, but the pursuitof power was not a goal that commanded popular passion … “except in conditionsof a sudden threat or challenge to the public’s sense of domestic well-being.”(i.e. September 11th). Brzezinski calls Eurasia the centre of world power forsome 500 years. This region spans a vast area from the borders of Germany andPoland across to China and down through India and the Middle East. Brzezinskiwrites that the power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’sthree most advanced and economically productive regions and this would also leadautomatically to Africa’s subordination. He points out that about 75 % of theworld population lives in Eurasia and most of the planet’s “physical wealth” isthere as well. Brzezinski goes on to say that the strategy for control of thisregion would lead to a new world order in which nation states would becontrolled solely by economic interests as dictated by banks, corporations andruling elites who would be solely concerned with the maintenance of their power.The Brzezinski (Illuminati) strategy is clear:> “… To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of> ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to> prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep> tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming> together.” 7Murder on demandAfghanistan’s new “transitional government” after the Taliban were defeated alsofitted the scenario that Niaz Naik said the American officials had presented tohim in mid-July. The post-Taliban interim regime was headed by Hamid Karzai, aformer Unocal adviser. He has since become head of the new Afghan government.Karsai is the representative of the exiled King Mohammed Zahir Shah, the mannamed to Naik by American officials months earlier as the possible leader of thecountry after the Taliban had been violently removed. Zahir Shah reigned from1933 to 1973 and was living in exile in Rome. He returned to Afghanistan inApril 2002 for the first time in 29 years and now lives in the PresidentialPalace. Hamid Karzai’s interim leadership on behalf of the king was madepossible by the highly convenient assassination of Ahmad Shah Massood (alsoMassoud) who, in late 1999, founded the United Front, later known as theNorthern Alliance. Massood led the Mujahadin forces that recaptured Kabul fromthe pro-Moscow government in 1992. He was assassinated by an “al-Qaeda” suicidebomber on September 9th, just two days before the attacks in America and, verysignificantly, had he lived he, and not Karzai, would have been the most likelyleader of the post-Taliban regime. The Northern Alliance blamed his death onPakistan’s Interservices Intelligence agency (ISI), which is little more thanthe Pakistan branch of the CIA. Abdul Haq, another Northern Alliance leader, hadbeen talking with American officials in the months before September 11th, but hewas apparently not considered “reliable” in pursuing their interests. TheTaliban murdered Haq in October 2001 when he returned to Afghanistan fromPakistan with at least one American in his party. The CIA and Pakistan’s ISI,which was extremely close to the Taliban, would have known where he was goingand when. Haq’s death was reported as a “devastating blow” to American effortsto create a post-Taliban regime and he was presented by the American governmentas “one of us”. In fact he was anything but. It emerged after his murder that hewas opposing the US invasion of Afghanistan. The Washington Post reported thatHaq had, in fact, “clashed with the CIA” and that the CIA and the US militaryhad been doubtful about Haq as an Afghan opposition leader.8 The CIA, said thePost article, did not like Haq’s independence and felt that he was “not alwayson message.” The real reason why Abdul Haq was manipulated into the hands of theTaliban before the US invasion began was made clear when the UK Guardianpublished the last interview he gave before his death to Anatol Lieven of the(Illuminati) Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Haq said:> “Military action by itself in the present circumstances is only making things> more difficult – especially if the war goes on a long time and many civilians> are killed. The best thing would be for the US to work for a united political> solution involving all Afghan groups … We have been trying to create a revolt> within the Taliban, but the US hasn’t given us the chance. They seem to have> been determined to attack, even if someone came up with the best proposal in> the world to avoid this.”The Illuminati network controlling the governments of the United States andBritain had a plan to invade Afghanistan and that was that. Nothing was going tostop them, whatever was suggested and September 11th was going to be the excusethey needed. Abdul Haq’s threat to this plan is obvious from his interview:> “… the US is trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in> the world. They don’t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many> people we will lose. And we don’t like that. Because Afghans are now being> made to suffer for these Arab fanatics, but all know who brought these Arabs> to Afghanistan in the 1980s, armed them, and gave them a base. It was the> Americans and the CIA. And the Americans who did this got medals and good> careers, while all these years Afghans suffered from these Arabs and their> allies. Now when America is attacked, instead of punishing the Americans who> did this, it punishes the Afghans.” 9Is anyone still in any doubt why Haq was killed and who was really behind it?The Times of India reported that Haq’s fatal expedition was financed by “wealthyAmerican brothers with US intelligence connections”, but that “the CIA and otherwestern agencies declined to provide Haq with the arms and air support he askedfor”.10 Robert McFarlane, the former National Security Adviser to theReagan-Bush administration, who was indicted for his role in Iran-Contra, hadheld meetings with Haq. McFarlane blamed the CIA for its part in Haq’s death. Hesaid the CIA had “betrayed” Haq by failing to support his operation intoAfghanistan, and leaving him to be captured and killed by the Taliban.11 WhenHamid Karsai was under threat from the Taliban a US helicopter was sent to hisrescue.The set-upWhen you put the pieces together it is a clear as can be that the wholeAfghanistan operation was planned long before the attacks in the United States.Richard Armitage, the US Deputy Secretary of State and the Illuminati-Bush-CIAoperative involved in drug running and political scandals like Iran-Contra,visited India in May 2001. In the same month George Tenet, the head of the CIA,went to Pakistan for “an unusually long meeting” with President Musharraf andalso met Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad, the head of Pakistan military intelligence,the ISI.12 Then you had US officials in mid-July saying they planned to attackAfghanistan by mid-October and that’s exactly what happened. They said theywanted a regime to replace the Taliban involving the exiled king, Zahir Shah. OnSeptember 9th the Northern Alliance leader, Ahmad Shah Massood, was assassinatedin a plot blamed on Pakistan’s ISI, a CIA front. The Northern Alliance statementsaid that: “… a Pakistani ISI-Osama-Taliban axis [was responsible for] plottingthe assassination by two Arab suicide bombers … We believe that this is atriangle between Osama bin Laden, ISI, which is the intelligence section of thePakistani army, and the Taliban.” 13 In October, Abdul Haq, another of theanti-Taliban leaders, was killed, “betrayed” by the CIA, said Robert McFarlane,Reagan’s National Security Adviser. Through these events the way was opened forthe king’s representative, Hamid Karzai, the former Unocal adviser, to lead theAfghan government when September 11th had been used to justify the removal ofthe Taliban.The Pakistan connectionMahmud Ahmad, the head of Pakistan military intelligence, or ISI, had arrived inWashington on September 4th for talks with CIA chief George Tenet and otherintelligence, Pentagon and government officials and remained there throughSeptember 11th. In the wake of the attacks, on September 12th and 13th, he metwith Richard Armitage and Senator Joseph Biden, the chairman of the powerfulSenate Committee on Foreign Relations that is dominated by the Rockefeller’sCouncil on Foreign Relations. Armitage was fundamentally involved in organisingthe US government-CIA funding of the bin Laden-Mujahadin networks in Afghanistanvia the ISI in Pakistan and was awarded the highest civil honour by Pakistan.After the Armitage-General Mahmoud “discussions”, Pakistan, a military statewith a long history of sponsoring terrorism (often for the CIA), then joined the“war on terrorism”. The US State Department itself, in a document calledPatterns of Global Terrorism,14 confirms the connections between terrorism andthe Pakistan military government of President Pervez Musharraf. Secretary ofState Colin Powell said in a news conference on September 13th:> “The United States remains concerned about reports of continued Pakistani> support for the Taliban’s military operations in Afghanistan. Credible> reporting indicates that Pakistan is providing the Taliban with material,> fuel, funding, technical assistance, and military advisers. Pakistan has not> prevented large numbers of Pakistani nationals from moving into Afghanistan to> fight for the Taliban. Islamabad also failed to take effective steps to curb> the activities of certain madrassas, or religious schools, that serve as> recruiting grounds for terrorism.” 15What he didn’t say, of course, is that the madrassas were funded by the CIA andSaudi Arabia, and supervised by CIA assets like Sheikh Omar who was laterconvicted of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center thanks to a bomb builtby an asset of the FBI. As Powell spoke these words, his deputy Richard Armitagewas meeting with the head of Pakistan intelligence at the State Department. Thiswas a staggering piece of mental gymnastics in which a sponsor of terrorism wasasked to join the “war on terrorism”. This was explained away as US officialsseeking cooperation from Pakistan because it was the original backer of theTaliban. Well, on that basis, seek support from the CIA then. To an outsiderwith no knowledge of the Illuminati, their agenda and methods, this would allappear absurd, but from the Illuminati perspective it’s not. They are simplyplaying their game of global manipulation and control, and that is not played onthe basis of logic, as publicly perceived, but on the basis of whatever isnecessary at the time to advance the agenda. One day you’ll condemn a person,country or organisation to achieve a certain outcome and the next you’ll do theopposite. Pakistan and Osama bin Laden are but two examples. The Pakistanintelligence chief Mahmud Ahmad was sent by the CIA and the Pakistan government(same thing) to “negotiate” with the Taliban for the extradition of Osama binLaden. The “mission” failed, of course, because that is the last thing theIlluminati wanted. If bin Laden was handed over there could be no bombing ofAfghanistan and there would never be enough evidence to convict him in a publiccourt anyway. “Go negotiate, Mahmud, so we can claim to be trying to avoidconflict, but for God’s sake don’t succeed, OK?” “Yes, sir.” Just as the bombingof Afghanistan began, the Pakistan government sacked Mahmud Ahmad under theguise of “early retirement” when the Times of India reported an allegedconnection with Mohamed Atta. This included, said the Times, the transfer toAtta of $100,000. The Agence France Press also reported that:> “A highly-placed government source told AFP that the ‘damning link’ between> the General and the transfer of funds to Atta was part of evidence which India> has officially sent to the US. ‘The evidence we have supplied to the US is of> a much wider range and depth than just one piece of paper linking a rogue> general to some misplaced act of terrorism,’ the source said.” 16The Times of India claimed that a guy called Ahmad Umar Sheikh made the transferto Atta on the orders of the General Mahmud. Ahmad Umar Sayeed Sheikh is aBritish national and a London School of Economics graduate who was arrested bythe police in Delhi following the bungled 1994 kidnapping of four westerners,including an American citizen.17 The Times said its information was based on anofficial intelligence report sent by the Indian government to the United States.The US indictment against alleged conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui in December2001 also claims that Atta was involved with a Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, or“Mustafa Ahmed”, from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who was based in the months before9/11 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The indictment says that on September 11thMustafa Ahmed left the United Arab Emirates for … Pakistan. The names ofPakistan and Saudi Arabia continually recur in this story.The killer questionThe US had clearly long planned to launch a war against Afghanistan bymid-October. But here’s the key question: how on earth would they ever havejustified such a sudden invasion if the September 11th attacks on America hadnot happened when they did? They would have had no chance of gathering togetherpublic and political support for such an invasion, especially in the few monthsthey had between the Niaz Naik meeting with American officials in mid-July andwhen the attacks were launched on October 7th. Why would they be so confidentthat they could pull it off, unless they knew that the public justification todo so was going to happen at precisely the right time? Instead of investigatingsuch matters, the Guardian turned the revelation that the USA was planning toinvade Afghanistan long before September 11th into further support for theofficial story. The paper suggested that this information meant that Osama binLaden “far from launching the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York andthe Pentagon out of the blue 10 days ago, was launching a pre-emptive strike inresponse to what he saw as US threats.” 18 As I said earlier, there is nothingmore imprisoning than an idea you will not let go. In this case, the idea thatthe official story of 9/11 is basically true and that Osama bin Laden did it.Until people let that go and look at the evidence dispassionately, they will goon trying to make the blatant anomalies and contradictions fit into the officialstory. I spoke to reporters on the Boston Globe and the New York Post and sawexactly the same reaction. The Globe reporter had seen for himself the clearcontradictions in the NORAD story that jets were/were not scrambled. But thesuggestion that government involvement in the attacks should be consideredsimply blew his mind and he would not even begin to go there. The New York Postreporter had written a lengthy article about 9/11, but it turned out to be a“clips job”. In other words, he took his information from other media articlesand had no idea of the sources. When I pointed out contradictions in thegovernment’s story he continually tried (and failed) to explain them away withinthe official version.Elephant in the living roomThe British forces used in the attacks on Afghanistan were based in Oman andhere again we have a highly convenient “coincidence”. Those forces did not leaveBritain for Oman after September 11th, but a week earlier. On Monday, September3rd, the biggest deployment of Royal Navy and Royal Marines since the FalklandsWar left the UK for long-planned (like the 9/11 attacks) “exercises” in Omanknown as Operation Swift Sword II led by the aircraft carrier Illustrious. Thismeant that by the time those planes struck the World Trade Center these UKforces were closing in on the very place they needed to be to take part in thesubsequent attacks on Afghanistan. Put this together with everything else andred flags abound. I hear people saying “Oh no, these exercises were planned forfour years.” But as I have been saying in book after book, the major Illuminatiproblem-reaction-solutions are also planned years, even decades, in advance witha specific date in mind. The “task group” to Oman was led by Rear Admiral JamesBurnell-Nugent, Commander of the UK Maritime Forces, who said:> “This is a significant display of maritime power – we are sending 8,500> sailors, airmen and Royal Marines to the Gulf Region. In total the Argonaut> task group consists of 40 separate commands, brought together into an> integrated, self sustaining joint fighting force.” 19This is precisely what you need for an attack on Afghanistan and the ongoing waragainst sanity in the Middle/Near East. Some 23,000 British troops were involvedin these “exercises”, and also “on station” before September 11th were 17,000 UStroops and 23,000 from NATO taking part in Operation Bright Star. These weremore “exercises”, this time in Egypt. Another location used for the attacks onAfghanistan was the US base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. This was“given” to the American government in the 1960s by the British Illuminati PrimeMinister and Bilderberger, Harold Wilson. The entire population was forced toleave the island by the UK government to allow the US military to move in. Nicepeople. Stan Goff, a retired Master Sergeant in US Special Forces, studied andtaught military science and doctrine. He was a tactics instructor at the JungleOperations Training Center in Panama and taught military science at the USmilitary academy at West Point, New York. Writing soon after September 11th, hesaid that, based on his experience in eight conflicts from Vietnam to Haiti, thestory he was hearing from the media about the invasion of Afghanistan was simplynot believable. “The most cursory glance at the verifiable facts, before,during, and after September 11th, does not support the official line or conformto the current actions of the United States government,” Goff wrote. He saidthat an “elephant in the living room is being studiously ignored”. He concludedon October 10th:> “Given this evidence that a military operation to secure at least a portion of> Afghanistan has been on the table, possibly as early as five years ago, I> can’t help but conclude that the actions we are seeing put into motion now are> part of a pre-September 11th agenda.

Which also leads me> to wonder – just for the sake of knowing – what actually did happen on> September 11th, and who actually is responsible.” 20Who is bin Laden?To understand the real background to Osama bin Laden, the CIA asset and stooge,we need to go back more than a decade to the Soviet Union’s occupation ofAfghanistan between 1979 and early 1989. The major funding for the Mujahadin,the forces in Afghanistan resisting the occupation, came from the CIA and SaudiArabia, and the channel for this support was Pakistan InterservicesIntelligence, or ISI. Not only did the United States fund the resistance to theSoviet occupation, they had worked to make it happen in the first place. It isworth stressing that the Soviet Union did not invade as such because it wasasked for help by the then Afghanistan government. Nur Mohammad Taraki, theleader of the ruling Marxist party, had introduced a regime in which women weretreated with respect, farming debt had been abolished, there was a minimum wage,and plans were underway for major land reform. These policies were destroyedwhen the Mujahadin rebels, supported by the CIA, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,launched a coup in September 1979 in which Taraki was murdered. The Marxistseventually removed the Mujahadin and returned to power, and that was when theyasked the Soviet Union for help, and the tanks rolled in. No doubt the SovietUnion had oil and other interests in mind as well. In a 1998 interview with theFrench publication Le Nouvel Observateur, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the big-timeIlluminati insider, said that the US had enticed the Soviet Union to invadeAfghanistan. Brzezinski was National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carterand a founder, with David Rockefeller, of the Illuminati’s TrilateralCommission. This manipulates the global agenda into being along with otherorganisations in its network, like the Council on Foreign Relations, RoyalInstitute of International Affairs, Bilderberg Group, and other far more elitegroupings and secret societies (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free).Brzezinski was also a founding force behind FEMA, the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, which is a 100% Illuminati-controlled operation in the UnitedStates. He said:> “According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadin began> during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan,> December 24, 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely> otherwise. Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first> directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.> And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him> that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military> intervention.”Brzezinski said that they “knowingly increased the probability” that the SovietUnion would invade, yet at the time the United States government vehementlydenied the Soviet claims that they had invaded to challenge the secretinvolvement of the US in Afghanistan, which had a pro-Soviet regime in power atthe time. Brzezinski was asked if he regretted what he did:> “Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect> of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The> day the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We> now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War …”The interviewer asked Brzezinski if regretted the support for Islamicfundamentalism and giving arms and advice to future terrorists:> “What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the> collapse of the Soviet Empire? Some stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of> Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?” 21The truth is that both the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the creation ofa terrorist network by funding the Afghan resistance were part of the Illuminatistrategy. Their agenda is not regulated by national borders or nationalinterest, but by the simple law of cause and effect. It is like a chessboard onwhich, largely, they have controlled both sides. To hear Brzezinski say he has“no regrets” about goading the Soviet Union into a war that led to the deaths ofone and half million Afghans and, through the Taliban, condemned the country andits women to the dark ages, is to understand the regard the Illuminati have forhuman life. I can’t stress enough that if you judge what these guys will do onthe basis of what you would do, you will never see what is really going on. TheIlluminati do not have the same emotional responses that most of the globalpopulation do and they will do things that the rest of us could hardlycomprehend. I will elaborate on the reasons for this in the final chapter.Remember, too, that while Jimmy Carter may have signed the first order forcovert support of the anti-Soviet Mujahadin in 1979, this was his last year inoffice. Ronald Reagan and Father George Bush won the November 1979 election andthey (Bush) were in power throughout the war between the Soviet Union and theMujahadin in Afghanistan from the end of 1979 until 1989. During that time, Bushwas unofficial president in the Reagan years and became official president in1988.Father George funded bin LadenThe funding of the Osama bin Laden terrorist network in Afghanistan during theSoviet occupation was arranged by George Bush, the close friend of the bin Ladenfamily and father of the current President. One of the many reasons forIlluminati interest in Afghanistan has been the enormous opium production overthe years. I can see the Bush family drooling from here. This was anothermotivation behind the CIA involvement in the country and it was through theagency’s supply network that the opium was exported to be sold as heroin anddestroy still more lives. After the American-backed Mujahadin had ousted theSoviet Union they forced farmers to plant opium in such quantities thatAfghanistan became the biggest producer of heroin on the planet and much of itended up on American streets. Two others involved in the funding of the terrornetwork were the Illuminati operatives George Shultz, Secretary of State underReagan-Bush, and Richard Armitage, the CIA drug runner who is now DeputySecretary of State in the “war on terrorism”! For the final years of theinvasion, the Soviet Union was led by Rockefeller place man Mikhail Gorbachev,who now runs a “foundation” in the United States calling for a world government,world army, etc., etc. (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free). You get thepicture.Al-Qaeda – courtesy of the CIAOne of the foremost authorities on recent Afghanistan history is Ahmed Rashid,the author of Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia.22He doesn’t just write about what happened, he lived through it. In 1978 he wasin Kabul when a palace coup ousted King Zahir Shah and booked him a ticket toRome. A year later Rashid was in Kandahar in the south of Afghanistan when theSoviet tanks arrived. He says that the resistance army, the Mujahadin, had theirroots in Afghanistan, but as the war continued others were brought in fromoutside by the CIA and the Saudis. These included Osama bin Laden and those whowere to form the foundations of al-Qaeda and later the Taliban. Al-Qaeda emergedfrom an organisation called Maktab al-Khidamar, or MAK, which bin Laden wasrunning by 1984 for the United States. It was funded and armed by the Americangovernment through Pakistan intelligence, the ISI. Rashid says that between 1986and 1987 the CIA Director William “Iran-Contra” Casey provided 900 Stingermissiles to the Mujahadin along with US advisers. Casey planned, with Britishand Pakistan intelligence, guerrilla attacks by the Mujahadin in the then Soviet“republics” of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Most significantly, given subsequentevents, this trio began to support plans by Pakistan intelligence (ISI) andPakistan’s President Zia to bring Muslims from all over the world to join theSoviet resistance groups in Afghanistan. Some 35,000 Islamic militants weretrained to fight in Afghanistan. These were the non-Saudis that MichaelSpringman, the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah from 1987 to1989, talks about. He said he was ordered to provide US visas for such peopleduring the Reagan-Bush and Bush presidencies, and he revealed that they went tothe United States for terrorist training by the CIA.Terrorist training camps in the USAThere are many centres in the USA where foreign terrorists are trained. Amongthem is the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. Al Martin, a retired NavyLt Commander, says that one of the Iranians involved in the bombing of the WorldTrade Center in 1993 was trained there and completed an explosives course in theguise of a Pakistan officer. The Pakistan connection to 9/11 is extremelyimportant. Martin, author of The Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran-ContraInsider,23 says he was head of accounting for the drug-running operationorchestrated by the Reagan-Bush administration and involving Oliver North.Another CIA terrorist training centre is Fort Benning in Georgia where theSchool of the Americas has been producing terrorists and dictators to serve USinterests in Latin America for decades. Literally hundreds of mass-murderingdictators, military leaders, death squad members, terrorists and human rightsabusers have been through the ranks at the School of the Americas or “The Schoolof the Assassins”, where training manuals uncovered by the US IntelligenceOversight Board supported terrorism, torture, and human rights abuses. WilliamThomas writes in his book, All Fall Down:> “In training more than 60,000 Latin American and Caribbean government forces,> the School of the Americas has spawned the region’s most murderous tyrants.> Graduates include Manuel Noriega, El Salvador death squad leader Roberto> D’Aubuisson, and the former dictators of Argentina, Peru, Ecuador and> Bolivia.” 24There is indeed no shortage of training facilities for the terrorists created bythe American and British governments now fighting the “war on terrorism”. TheSaudi royal family also became heavily involved in the recruitment of non-Afghanfighters and they funded new Islamic fundamentalist schools, or madrassas, inAfghanistan and Pakistan that would spawn the imprisoned, conditioned minds thatbecame the Taliban. Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the man convicted with associatesof the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, ran an operation called theService Office in Peshawar, Pakistan, which recruited Muslim fighters for theCIA, Osama bin Laden, and the Mujahadin in Afghanistan.25 The name Talibanliterally means “students”. Afghan writer Ahmed Rashid says that the Saudis tookthe opportunity to advance the influence of Wahabbism, their preferred form ofIslam, which, as I know from my months in Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s, is asick form of fascism. The Mujahadin were dominated by the Shia expression ofIslam, while the Taliban, for the reasons described, would follow the extremeSaudi variety with its violent imposition of Islamic “law” (their version) andthe utterly unimaginable abuse of women. Girls were not allowed in schools andwomen could not work. Public executions happened all the time for “crimes” likehomosexuality and adultery. These guys were seriously deranged. While the UnitedStates and Britain wheeled out their “first ladies”, Laura Bush and CherieBlair, to condemn the Taliban’s treatment of women, the truth is that thishappened thanks to Saudi Arabia (which still treats women much the same way) andthe governments and intelligence arms of the United States, Britain andPakistan. The madrassas on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan were a verysignificant means of Taliban support. They were controlled by the Jamiat-e-UlemaIslam, a Pakistani-based Islamic extremist party. From here they supplied manyTaliban recruits and provided a link between the Taliban and PakistanInterservices Intelligence, the ISI.Ahmed Rashid says that the ISI wanted a member of the Saudi royal family to jointhe Islamic mercenaries from around the world in Afghanistan. But there was noway these pampered hypocrites would leave their Saudi palaces for theunforgiving mountains of Afghanistan. The closest they could get was Osama binLaden who came from an immensely wealthy Saudi family with extremely strongconnections to the “royals”. He joined forces with Prince Turki, the Saudiintelligence chief, and General Gul, the head of the ISI. Rashid says thesethree were in constant contact. In turn, Gul was close to the CIA as the ISIacted, together with the BCCI, as a channel through which billions of dollarsfrom the United States government found their way to bin Laden and theMujahadin. This CIA money paid Bin Laden Construction to build the very“al-Qaeda” tunnel complexes the US bombed in the “war on terrorism”! AhmedRashid wrote of bin Laden:> “He brought in engineers from his father’s company and heavy construction> equipment to build roads and warehouses for the Mujaheddin. In 1986, he helped> build a CIA-financed tunnel complex, to serve as a major arms storage depot,> training facility and medical center for the Mujaheddin, deep under the> mountains close to the Pakistan border.” 26With the end of the war with the Soviet Union in 1989, the battles began betweenAfghan factions for control of their now “free” country, and the Mujahadinenforced a policy for the mass production of opium and its processing intoheroin. This also involved Osama bin Laden according to Michael Ruppert, aformer drug investigator with the Los Angeles police. He says that bin Ladenworked with Gulbadin Hekmatyar who ran six heroin factories in Afghanistan andPakistan.27 We are told that bin Laden returned to construction in Saudi Arabiawhen the Soviet Union was ousted. But if he did, and I don’t believe it, thiswas only for a while.Enter the TalibanAs the generations grew up in Afghanistan who had no education except for theIslamic fundamentalism taught in the Saudi-funded “schools”, a very differentvision of religion, life and law began to dominate significant swathes of Afghansociety, especially in the south. These were generations, says Ahmed Rashid, whohad known only war, and many were orphans who had grown up without mothers orsisters, and had never known the unique gift of a woman’s company and influence.Life expectancy was only around 44 years and 25% of children died before the ageof five. The simple fundamental expression of their religion was the veryfoundation of their existence. It was all they had, and it was the United Statesand Britain, as well as the Saudis and the Soviet Union, who had created thecircumstances for this. More than that, the USA, Britain and Saudi Arabia alsosupported the Taliban’s campaign of war and terrorism against the NorthernAlliance, the consortium of Afghan warlords from the former Mujahadin who wereequally violent and dehumanised by the years of never-ending conflict. Mutualhate for the Taliban was pretty much all that held the Northern Alliancetogether. Ahmed Rashid points out that before the Taliban came to power, PrinceTurki, the head of Saudi intelligence and close associate of Osama bin Laden,visited the Pakistan capital Islamabad, the home of the bin Laden-supportingISI, and the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.28 After this visit, the Saudis gavemoney and arms to support the Taliban’s attack on the capital, Kabul. This gavethe Taliban control over most of the country in 1996 except for the region inthe north that was still held by the Northern Alliance.29 Far from opposing theTaliban, the United States government, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the US andSaudi oil cartel were delighted with their rise to power. Indeed they were allinvolved in providing the finance and weaponry that allowed it to happen. From aragbag of students, the Taliban had, in little more than a year, gatheredtogether an army of some 20,000 men supported by ground and air weaponry. Yousimply don’t do that without massive outside funding and supply. Newsweek alsoreported that Osama bin Laden provided $3 million to the Taliban that was usedto bribe opponents to defect and open the route to Kabul in 1996.30The Unocal and Delta-Nimir oil companies, which planned the pipelines acrossAfghanistan, were particularly pleased with events. Delta-Nimir was MohamedHussein Al-Amoudi and Khalid bin Mahfouz, both business associates of the Bushfamily and named by the US government in the Clinton years as funders of the binLaden network. The Taliban victory promised the “stability” that would allow thepipelines to carry lucrative oil and gas from the Caspian Sea region acrossAfghanistan to the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan. Chris Taggart, a Unocalexecutive, said that the Taliban victory would make the pipeline project“easier”.31 Ahmed Rashid writes that a US diplomat told him: “The Taliban willprobably develop like the Saudis did. There will be Aramco, pipelines, an emir,no parliament and lots of Sharia law. We can live with that.” 32 Glyn Davies,another State Department official, said the United States found ‘nothingobjectionable’ in the steps taken by the Taliban to impose Islamic law.33 Hesaid the Taliban were anti-modern, not anti-western. They were actuallyanti-life. The war criminal Henry Kissinger, an “adviser” to Unocal, alsopredictably supported a pipeline deal with the Taliban and it was because ofpeople like him that at no time before September 11th 2001 was Afghanistan namedby the US government on its list of states that sponsor terrorism. Mind you, itdoesn’t list itself or Britain either.So what if women would now be treated disgustingly and be denied even basicrights? So what if people would be beaten in the street or stoned to death bythe Taliban’s religious thought police who were nothing more than an “Islamic”SS? So what? We get our pipeline don’t we? There were no bleeding hearts inWashington or London, and no demand that the Taliban be removed. Far from beingcondemned, Taliban leaders were flown to Texas and Washington to be feted byUnocal, the US State Department, and senators like Hank Brown, as negotiationscontinued for the pipeline deal. The Taliban were even represented by a publicrelations adviser called Laili Helms, the niece by marriage of Richard Helms,the former head of the CIA. Laili Helms was the Taliban’s “unofficial ambassadorin the US and their most active and best-known advocate elsewhere in theWest”.34 Funny how the Taliban stopped Afghan women from taking careers, butwere quite happy to be represented by one in the United States. Richard Helms,by the way, was CIA director in the 1960s, the period of Cuba and Vietnam. Hewas accused of destroying most of the CIA’s secret documents that detailed theagency’s own crimes. It was Helms who, as ambassador to Iran, arranged for thetraining of the notorious secret police of the then Shah.35 The State Departmentalso lobbied heavily for the Unocal project with both the Taliban and thePakistan government when the rival offer by the Argentine company, Bridas,threatened to win their approval. Only when women’s groups mounted a fiercecampaign against the deal and the US government could see that the NorthernAlliance resistance to the Taliban made their rule potentially unstable, didUnocal and friends withdraw from the negotiations while announcing that theproject could only go ahead when a stable, internationally recognised, regimewas in place in Afghanistan. Now, thanks to the “war on terrorism” spawned by9/11, that’s exactly what they have and the pipeline plans have been pulled fromthe pending file.The US Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher exposed the real force behind theTaliban during Congressional hearings on July 12th 2000. Rohrabacher was anAfghanistan specialist who supported the former king, Zahir Shah. SinceSeptember 11th, and with the return to power of the king’s supporters,Rohrabacher has gone quiet. But the year before, he had said that he knew theUnited States only sent “humanitarian aid” to Taliban-controlled areas and theState Department had shown no interest in pursuing information about thelocation of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. This is a constant pattern, as wewill see. Rohrabacher said that while the State Department claimed to oppose binLaden and the Taliban, the US government had been covertly supporting them. Healso spoke of the way the United States had manipulated the Taliban into powerin Kabul:> “At a time when the Taliban were vulnerable, the top person of this [Clinton]> administration, Mr Inderfurth, and Bill Richardson, personally went to> Afghanistan and convinced the anti-Taliban forces not to go on the offensive> and, furthermore, convinced all of the anti-Taliban forces, their supporters,> to disarm them and to cease their flow of support for the anti-Taliban forces.> At that same moment, Pakistan initiated a major resupply effort, which> eventually saw the defeat, and caused the defeat, of almost all of the> anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan. [The very same forces the USA and Britain> then supported to remove the Taliban after September 11th!]> “Now, with a history like that, it’s very hard, Mr Ambassador, for me to sit> here and listen to someone say, ‘Our main goal is to drain the swamp’ – and> the swamp is Afghanistan – because the United States created that swamp in> Afghanistan. And the United States’ policies have undercut those efforts to> create a freer and more open society in Afghanistan, which is consistent with> the beliefs of the Afghan people.” 36Rohrabacher said that not only had the US government acted in a way that keptthe Taliban in power, they also showed no interest in acting upon information hehad offered the administration on at least three occasions of the preciselocation of bin Laden’s headquarters in Afghanistan. Even in 2001 the Bushadministration openly gave the Taliban $124.2 million, and one payment of $43million was authorised by Secretary of State Colin Powell as late as May.Bin Laden returnsThe official story goes that somehow Osama bin Laden suddenly developed a deephatred of the United States because of the attacks on Iraq in the Gulf War andtheir subsequent sanctions. His dramatic conversion to the “I Hate America”movement is supposed to have manifested even though bin Laden was funded andarmed during the Soviet occupation by the CIA through the Bank of Credit andCommerce International (BCCI), Pakistan Interservices Intelligence (ISI), andthe Saudi royal family; and despite the fact that he supported the victory ofthe Taliban, which was also funded by CIA-backed sources. I don’t buy it myself.Nor do I purchase the claim that he has been “ostracised” by his family. TheBushes are extremely close to the bin Ladens and the Saudi royals, and it wasFather George Bush who launched the attack on Iraq in 1991 that was supposed tohave made bin Laden hate the United States. It was also during Bush’s control ofthe White House that Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network were funded andarmed by the CIA. The “Osama supports Iraq” story doesn’t make sense. Asresearcher Jared Israel points out on his excellent website,37 there is anenormous difference between the harsh and extreme form of “Islam” that bin Ladenclaims to support and that of Iraq. The regime may be a dictatorship, but itdoes not impose Islam in anything like the same way as Saudi Arabia andAfghanistan under the Taliban. When bin Laden was backing the Taliban in theirbattle for control of Afghanistan, they were fighting a similar religious regimein Kabul to that in Iraq. Afghan writer Ahmed Rashid said of bin Laden: “AfterIraq’s invasion of Kuwait he lobbied the Saudi royal family to organise civildefense in the kingdom and to raise a force from among the Afghan war veteransto fight Iraq.” 38 How does that fit with “Osama supports Iraq and he developeda hatred of the United States because of the Gulf War”? He is supposed to hatethe American government because of the Gulf War and yet here he wanted to joinin, according to Rashid. Then there is the claim that bin Laden was alsoincensed by the American military presence in the Islamic “Holy Land” of SaudiArabia after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But hold on. As Jared Israelrecounts, the bases the US occupied were built in the 1980s at a cost of morethan $200 billion in the biggest US military construction project outside theUnited States.39 Scott Armstrong, an investigative reporter on the WashingtonPost, told the US television show Frontline on February 16th 1993, that theSaudis themselves had provided most of the money, some $156 billion, which, hesaid, he could document line by line.> “[The United States has] managed to create an interlocking system that has one> master control base, five sub-control bases, any one of which is capable of> operating the whole thing, that are in hardened bunkers, that are hard-wired,> that is to say, against nuclear blast or anything else. They created nine> major ports that weren’t there before, dozens of airfields all over the> kingdom. They have now hundreds of modern American fighter planes and the> capability of adding hundreds more. The Saudis alone have spent $156 billion> that I can document line by line, item by item, on weapon systems and> infrastructure to support this.” 40Guess who was a major contractor building these facilities in Saudi Arabia forthe “hated infidels” of the United States, the facilities where American troopswere located in the Islamic “Holy Land” when the Gulf War was launched? Yes, yes… Bin Laden Construction! This was happening at a time when Osama bin Laden wasin Afghanistan and Bin Laden Construction was building the “al-Qaeda” tunnelcomplexes supported by their family friend and the real power in the White Housein this period, Father George Bush.Bin Laden, Bill Clinton and KosovoWhile Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were using NATO to bomb Serbia and Kosovo for41 days in 1999, Osama bin Laden was also involved – on Clinton’s “side”. TheKosovo “Liberation” Army (KLA) and its offshoot, the National Liberation Army(NLA), were still more CIA fronts. They were fundamentally connected to, andfinanced by, the trafficking of drugs to the United States and throughoutEurope. Drug agents in five countries believed this drug cartel to be one of themost powerful heroin smuggling organisations in the world and their operationbecame known as the “Balkan Route”.41 Greek Interpol said that Kosovo’s ethnicAlbanians were the primary sources of supply for cocaine and heroin in thatcountry; France’s Geopolitical Observatory of Drugs said the Kosovo LiberationArmy was a key player in the drugs-for-arms business and was helping totransport $2 billion worth of drugs a year into western Europe; German drugagents said $1.5 billion in drug profits was laundered annually by Kosovosmugglers through as many as 200 private banks or currency exchange offices.42The company contracted to supply the US “peacekeeping” troops in the formerYugoslavia is Brown & Root, the drug-running subsidiary of Dick Cheney’sHaliburton.Despite this background, the drug-running, Osama bin Laden-supported KLA waspresented in a very different light by Clinton and Blair. They told us the KLAwere “freedom fighters” battling to save the ethnic Albanian Muslims in Kosovofrom Serbian oppression. Yet, as the Washington Times reported, quoting“intelligence documents”, members of the KLA were trained in Afghanistan and atTropoje, Albania, in the terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden.43 Britain’sSunday Times quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of Albanian intelligence, asconfirming that the network of Osama bin Laden sent units into the Serbianprovince of Kosovo.44 The Washington Times reported that members of the formerMujahadin in Afghanistan were recruited to fight for the KLA, who, I stress,were controlled by the CIA and the United States and British governments. At thesame time those same governments were blaming the 1998 US Embassy bombings inNairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Osama bin Laden. The StateDepartment offered a reward of $5 million for his capture (yawn). Clinton hadalso bombed Sudan and Afghanistan in “retaliation” for the bombings. The sameyear the US government had condemned the KLA as a terrorist organisation thatwas funded by the heroin trade and Osama bin Laden. Now here was “NATO” (the USand Britain) supporting this same terrorist organisation with 41 days of bombingagainst civilian targets in which it was claimed by Serbia that 1,200 peoplewere killed and 5,000 wounded. Once again manipulating behind the scenes in theBalkans on behalf of the Illuminati drug and oil interests was Richard Armitage,the current US Deputy Secretary of State.“This is Osama bin Laden, CIA, Afghanistan”The story of bin Laden turning against his former paymasters in America, theSaudi royal dictatorship, and being disinherited by his family, is completecrap. He was a CIA asset and he’s still a CIA asset – and stooge. That’s whyClinton refused to put him on trial when he had the chance in 1996, as I willexplain shortly. That’s why they refused a Taliban offer to hand over bin Laden,as French researcher Jean-Charles Brisard revealed in Bin Laden: The ForbiddenTruth. That’s why, as the BBC Newsnight programme reported, the present Bushadministration told the FBI to back off investigating the bin Laden connection.That’s why they didn’t “find” him when they invaded Afghanistan despite killingat least 5,000 civilians while “looking” for him. According to Jean-CharlesBrisard, the FBI’s Deputy Director and head of anti-terrorism John O’Neillresigned in July 2001 because the US State Department was blocking theinvestigation into the bombing of the USS Cole – an attack blamed on the binLaden network. Brisard said that O’Neill told him: “The main obstacles toinvestigate Islamic terrorism were US oil interests and the role played by SaudiArabia in it.” O’Neill became head of security at the World Trade Center anddied in the attacks of September 11th. Brisard writes that O’Neill told him theUS State Department (Powell and Armitage) “explicitly blocked” hisinvestigations into bin Laden’s activities. Brisard said: “We now know fromdifferent files that the FBI was starting investigations on different aspects ofSaudi Arabian support [of bin Laden], and those investigations were all stopped,even under Clinton.” 45 The Revolutionary Association of the Women ofAfghanistan, which challenged the Taliban’s horrific treatment of women, issueda statement on September 14th 2001 condemning the terrorist attacks against theUnited States. But they also summed up the real story of Osama bin Laden, the“pursuit” of whom, caused thousands of men, women and children, to be murderedby US and British bombing:> “… the people of Afghanistan have nothing to do with Osama and his> accomplices. But unfortunately we must say that it was the Government of the> United States who supported Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul-Haq in creating> thousands of religious schools from which the germs of Taliban emerged. In the> similar way, as is clear to all, Osama has been the blue-eyed boy of the CIA.”> 46You want bin Laden? Er, no thanksThe official bin Laden biography says that he fell out with his former alliesover the Gulf War and the US presence in Saudi Arabia, and he began to gatherhis terrorist reputation after being named as a conspirator in the 1993 bombingof the World Trade Center (the work of the FBI, the CIA and Mossad). In 1996 heheaded for Sudan, but what they don’t tell you in the official CV is that inMarch of that year the Sudan Minister for Defence, Major General Elfatih Erwa,offered to extradite bin Laden to Saudi Arabia or the United States. Both offerswere refused. The Washington Post reported the story, saying that Sudan hadoffered either to keep a close watch on him or arrest him for extradition.47Ironically, given more recent events, the Clinton administration said they couldnot put him on trial because they did not have enough evidence against him! Theyalso said they were concerned about a “fundamentalist backlash” if they executedhim. Anyway, why kill one of your own? The Washington Post said that USofficials had told Sudan: “Just ask him to leave the country. Just don’t let himgo to Somalia.” Major General Elfatih Erwa said he told the Americans that binLaden would go to Afghanistan. He said the American officials replied: “Lethim.” 48 Here was an opportunity to put bin Laden on trial without a shot beingfired, but it wasn’t part of the Illuminati strategy so it didn’t happen. That’sthe criteria for everything – is it part of the agenda or not? This is whyevents that seem so contradictory when you don’t know the background makeperfect sense when you do. On August 20th 1998, two years after the Sudaneseoffered to hand over bin Laden to the Clinton administration and were turneddown, the same President Clinton ordered the bombing of the El Shifapharmaceutical plant in Sudan producing 60% of the medicines for a desperate,starving, disease-ridden people. Clinton said the plant in Khartoum wasproducing chemical weapons and had links with Osama bin Laden, who was accusedof involvement in the bombings that year at the US embassies in Kenya andTanzania. But the United States government later had to admit its “mistake”. Theplant was not producing chemical weapons, just medicines. Goodness knows howmany died and suffered in Sudan as a result of this “mistake”. Clinton had beendesperate to avert public attention at the time of the bombing from therevelations of his antics with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Cindy’s storyStill more confirmation that the authorities had no desire to locate and arrestbin Laden comes with the story of a British couple, Alan and Cindy Thompson,which they told to me after being ignored by everyone they had contacted inofficialdom. They drove on their “honeymoon” through 18 countries to Kathmanduand back in a ten-year-old Sherpa van. They covered 22,366 miles over the periodof a year and by May 1999 they were in Pakistan on the way home. They had driventhrough the Khyber Pass with an armed guard and were skirting the border ofAfghanistan (Figure 26 overleaf). The main road from Dera Ismail Khan (DI Khan)to Quetta was blocked by flooding and they were directed by locals down a dirttrack, which turned out to be 80 miles of rough dry river bed. It took them thebest part of 11 hours to complete this part of the journey before they reachedtarmac at a very small checkpoint just outside the small town of Zhob (formerlyFort Sanderman) and “started to rejoice”. However, they found themselves facedwith “a rather shady group of armed men, who stood blocking the road ahead”. Themen turned out to be friendly, but when they reached Zhob, they were surroundedby locals. Cindy said that two policemen appeared from nowhere demanding to seetheir passports. They were allowed to go to a small hotel, but Cindy said, “thewhole of Zhob followed us and the police insisted that we fill in some forms”.She recalled to me:image [../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 26: The Pakistan/Afghanistan border towns where Alan and Cindy Thompsonfound evidence of a secret hideout of Osama bin Laden and visits by Americangovernment officials > “We parked our Sherpa in the hotel car park and asked to use one of the> showers. We were shown to a room and were followed in by two young men. When> we asked what they wanted they told us that they were security! We told them> that we didn’t need security and to leave us to have a shower. We then asked> if we could buy some food. The hotel didn’t have any food, but another young> man offered to take us somewhere in town who would be able to cook us> something to eat. He was calm and gentle natured, explaining that he wanted to> be a tourist guide and move out of Zhob.> “His friend who tagged along was very different and took control of the> conversation, making his views on politics and religion known to us in a very> forceful manner … ‘Osama bin Laden and Islam for the world.’ He told us:> ‘Osama is my hero.’ When I started asking him questions about Osama, why was> Osama his hero, and what had he done to be given the title hero, he> conveniently told us that he was illiterate and couldn’t speak English. In> fact, his English was very good.> “This guy wasn’t friendly and we wanted to leave and were feeling> uncomfortable. On the way back to our Sherpa, the second young man was joking> with passer’s by about our conversation, mentioning bin Laden a number of> times. We felt it obvious that he and others in the town knew Osama bin> Laden.”Cindy said they knew that bin Laden was a very wanted man and the reward for hiscapture or location was standing at $5 million. They slept in the van overnightat the hotel in case they needed to move quickly, and left very early thefollowing morning. When they arrived at Quetta, the last main town before theycrossed into Iran, they saw a copy of Dawn, the English national paper ofPakistan. Inside was an article headed “More Foreigners Visit Afghan BorderAreas” and they were shocked to find that they were mentioned, albeitinaccurately:> “Meanwhile, other foreign nationals were also in DI Khan … Mr Alan” [Cindy’s> husband Alan] “and Ms Cendy” “… passed the night in their vehicle No S176 ESU> [it was actually F176, not S] within the Rose Hotel’s premises.”The article went on to reveal how “… some intelligence agency people said thatsomehow the foreigners seem to have discovered the hide-out of Osama bin Ladenand a further probe was on.” What made this even more relevant is that thearticle revealed that this location had been visited on May 6th 1999 by “two USconsulate officers from Peshawar”, where they met the “commissioner and thepolitical agent, South Waziristan”. The newspaper also said that Australian HighCommissioner, Geoffrey Allen, and his wife, had visited the location at the sametime that Alan and Cindy Thompson were there. She said that an Afghani told themthat a Swiss Embassy official was also visiting the area. The Dawn newspaperreported:> “The Australians all the while stayed in DI Khan and the High Commissioner was> seen to [be] under strict surveillance of a secret agency. However, early> Friday morning Mr Geoffrey Allen rather surreptitiously left the Circuit House> in his car and returned after about 90 minutes … the political agent South> Waziristan, Arbab Mohammad Hanif, was also in DI Khan on Thursday and Friday.”Why all this activity by officials of the United States, Australian, and Swissgovernments in a remote location that just happened to be an alleged hideout ofOsama bin Laden? As the Dawn newspaper article said: “… The foreigners in thearea had the same destination, Zhob in Balochistan, which is situated near theAfghan border with Pakistan … It is for the first time that such activity hasbeen observed in this area [the road from Zhob to DI Khan], which had virtuallyremained out of bounds even for the locals.” The paper reported official denialsof sightings of United States commandoes and a US base in northwestern parts ofPakistan, an area called Waziristan.Alan Thompson contacted the British Embassy in Islamabad, who did not at firstbelieve they were even in Pakistan. They were advised to take the first flightout, but they couldn’t because of their vehicle. Instead, Malcolm Bennett, theBritish Embassy Warden, was sent to collect them under armed guard and take themto a safe house. While they were there they were invited to a garden party forex-patriots, hosted by a friend of Malcolm Bennett. Some of the people at theparty were aid agency employees, from both America and the UK, who were workingon aid projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Cindy said that one of the Americanaid workers told her he had to “move his office in Kandahar because Osama binLaden had set up office next door”! When they arrived back in the UK, the couplesaw an article calling for the capture of bin Laden. They said they phoned theLondon police headquarters at New Scotland Yard and told their story to anofficer with the Anti-Terrorist Squad. Cindy said he told her they wouldprobably be interviewed. They never were. They wrote to the FBI, via theAmerican Embassy in London, but did not receive even an acknowledgement. Theyfollowed up with letters to the Pentagon, but it was the same story. Noresponse. They contacted the BBC and national newspapers, but no one wanted toknow. Cindy said that she contacted the foreign editor of the Observernewspaper, which was stating that bin Laden might be hiding in Pakistan. “Hetold me in a most rude manner that, ‘Bin Laden didn’t hide in Pakistan, butlived in Afghanistan in a cave!’ … then slammed the receiver down before I evenhad chance to ask when he last visited Pakistan to know such a thing for sure.”She said she then posted her story on the CBN news website bulletin board, underthe heading: “I found the secret hide out of Osama bin Laden, but no one wantsto know. Why?” She said her story “was censored and taken off the website within10 minutes, stating that it had been censored by the web master … I re-posted itand it was removed again”. After 9/11, the couple re-contacted New Scotland YardAnti-Terrorist Squad, but still they received no reply. This was CindyThompson’s summary of their whole experience:> “We were gobsmacked. We found it incredible that we were offering to give> first-hand true information about the most wanted man in the world and the US> Embassy couldn’t even be bothered to get off their butts and come and> interview us! … We feel that it is about time that this story is told to the> world to let the people know the truth to make up their own minds. I believe> the truth is: the hunt for bin Laden is a farce. Which makes the $5 billion> reward for his capture a farce. Which must make the war on terror a farce.> Which in turn makes the governments waging the phoney war a farce. Which of> course must make the system that puts the governments into power a farce. It’s> all such a farce.”That’s exactly what it is.Bin Laden and the TalibanBin Laden returned to Afghanistan from Sudan in 1996 and enjoyed great influencewith the Taliban and their leader Mullah Omar. Bin Laden ran his “terroristtraining camps” from the very caves and tunnel complexes built with Saudi andCIA funds by Bin Laden Construction, and these camps were populated by many ofthe fanatics brought from all over the world to Afghanistan during the Sovietinvasion by the CIA, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The United States government hadsupported these people to achieve one part of the agenda, now they would turnagainst them to achieve another – the “war on terrorism” that followed September11th. It is clear that bin Laden, while being accused of terrorism by the UnitedStates government and its agencies like the CIA, has, at the same time, beenfunded and protected by them. This may sound strange, but when people appreciatethe nature of the Illuminati agenda and its techniques of manipulation, it makesperfect sense. You need a “baddie” on which to focus public outrage and fear,and this allows you to go about your covert business behind the “baddie”smokescreen. Remember Colonel Gaddafi in Libya? He was a threat to the world atone stage, apparently, the Saddam Hussein of the time, and the “most wanted”terrorist mastermind on earth. Whatever happened to him? He’s just another“monster” who has been surpassed by others in the game – the game of mass mindmanipulation. Osama bin Laden has never ceased to be an asset and stooge of theCIA and the Saudi royal family. It was even reported by the French daily LeFigaro, among others, that bin Laden was visited by a CIA agent at the AmericanHospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, while being treated for a kidneyinfection between July 4th and 14th 2001, just weeks before September 11th, andmembers of his family (you know, the ones that ostracised him) were also amongthe visitors.49Air bin Laden?The question of how Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar escapedfrom Afghanistan might be answered by the news that in November 2001, soon afterthe US and British bombing began, leaders of the Taliban and members of al-Qaedawere flown out of the northern Afghan city of Kunduz to safety in Pakistan. Howmany other similar flights were made we don’t know. Seymour Hersh, DefenseCorrespondent for the New Yorker magazine, said a senior intelligence source hadconfirmed that members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda “accidentally” escaped duringthe United States-supported evacuation of Pakistan military officials from thetown.50 “Dirt got through the screen”, the source is quoted as saying. I thinkthe screen was covered in shit to start with and “Pakistan military officials”were hand in glove with the Taliban and bin Laden anyway. The US military “may”have directly cooperated in the airlifts, the article said, and US centralcommand was ordered to establish a special air corridor to ensure safe passagefor the “rescue flights”. Alleged targets of the US and British bombing wereflown to safety while the men, women and children of Afghanistan and the Talibanfoot soldiers were left to their fate. Defense Secretary Donald “aspartame”Rumsfeld had strenuously denied that the flights took place. While the flightswere happening in November 2001, Rumsfeld said in typical Illuminati reversespeech: “If we see them, we shoot them down. Any idea that those people shouldbe let loose on any basis at all to leave that country and destabilise othercountries is unacceptable.” More lies. Decoded, he said: “If we see them wedon’t shoot them down. Any idea that those people should be let loose on anybasis at all to leave that country and destabilise other countries is thoroughlyacceptable and suits us perfectly.” When faced with the New Yorker story,Rumsfeld still denied the airlift took place: “I do not believe it happened. Noone that I know connected with the United States in any way saw any such thingas a major air exodus out of Afghanistan into Pakistan.” (Because they werelooking the other way at the time.) Brajesh Mishra, the Indian National SecurityMinister, is quoted as saying that as many as 5,000 Pakistanis (Taliban andal-Qaeda among them) were rescued.Patsy bin LadenDespite all this funding and support of the Taliban and bin Laden from theUnited States, and their refusal to arrest or investigate him when the chancewas there, he was immediately named as the man behind September 11th. When aproblem-reaction-solution is being orchestrated you lay the false blame asquickly as possible to focus public attention on the diversion and ensure thatthose really responsible remain uninvestigated and unexposed. Bin Laden wasnamed for a number of reasons. These included the fact that as a “Mr Big”terrorist, so the story goes, he has his “network” all over the world. Anycountry in fact that the US and British Illuminati factions want to demonise,bomb and take over in their open-ended “war on terrorism”. More immediately itgave them the excuse to bomb the men, women and children of Afghanistan, removethe Taliban, and ensure that they can build and defend the pipelines that willgive them control of the Caspian Sea oil and gas. I don’t believe the al-Qaeda“network” is anything like as extensive as we’re told and nor that bin Laden isits ultimate controller. I have heard from two separate people with contactsinto the intelligence community in the United States that Osama bin Laden wasdead before September 11th and everything since relating to him has been aHollywood movie. What better way to ensure that you have complete control of thestory? Amazing, I grant you, but that’s what they say.If bin Laden was planning the brilliantly organised attacks that we saw onSeptember 11th, the idea that the CIA and connected agencies would not haveknown about it is ludicrous. Bin Laden has moved around Afghanistan with a hugeentourage and could have been located any time, just as David Koresh could havebeen arrested again and again when he left the Waco compound without the need tomurder men, women and children, as they did so coldly and deliberately in 1993.These guys can read your licence plate from space and yet they could not trackbin Laden, either in the years before 9/11 or since? What a laugh. The infamousEchelon surveillance network, operated by the United States from locations likeMenwith Hill in Yorkshire, England, constantly monitors telephone, fax, ande-mail communications around the world by using “key words” and voiceidentification technology to pick out those of most interest to the intelligenceagencies. Particular targets, like suspected terrorists, are directly monitoredthrough this system. Echelon appears to have been designed by the NationalSecurity Agency (NSA) based at Fort Meade, between Washington and Baltimore, andit is connected with “collecting” stations around the world that monitorInternet, fax, phone calls, databases, and e-mails, together with “all telexescarried over the world’s telecommunications networks, along with financialdealings: money transfers, airline destinations, stock information, data ondemonstrations or international conferences, and much more”.51 A former DefenseIntelligence Agency official told United Press International (UPI): “It’s apretty awesome capability.” Echelon can also intercept all the messages carriedby the communications satellites positioned above the equator and each of themcan process hundreds of thousands of e-mails, phone calls and telexes as well asmonitoring undersea cables. Days after September 11th the German dailynewspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported that US and Israeliintelligence agencies had received warning signals at least three months earlierthrough the Echelon system that Middle Eastern terrorists were planning tohijack commercial aircraft to use as weapons to attack important symbols ofAmerican and Israeli culture. British intelligence agencies also had advancewarning, the paper said, quoting German intelligence sources.52They knew exactly where bin Laden was, before and after, but they did nothingbecause that was not the idea. The Baltimore Sun reported five months before theattacks that National Security Agency officials “… have sometimes played tapesof bin Laden talking to his mother to impress members of Congress and selectvisitors to the agency”.53 Richard Sale, the UPI International TerrorismCorrespondent, reported seven months before September 11th how a US governmentcase against bin Laden in the United States District Court in Manhattan was“based mainly on National Security Agency (NSA) intercepts of phone callsbetween bin Laden and his operatives around the world – Afghanistan to London,from Kenya to the United States”.54 Khalid Al Fawwaz, who was on trial,allegedly ran bin Laden’s “media information office” in London and provided binLaden with a satellite phone, the indictment said, “to facilitatecommunications”. Instead, said the UPI report, it allowed the US and Britishauthorities to listen in on bin Laden’s conversations. Sale wrote that when UPIwanted to send information to a former CIA official about Ayman al-Zawahiri, asenior bin Laden military commander and organiser, the CIA man exclaimed: “MyGod, don’t put that in an e-mail,” and indicated that the worldwide listeningsystem would “light up”. “NSA has huge watch lists,” he said. Ben Venzke, theDirector of Intelligence, Special Projects, for iDefense, a Virginia informationwarfare firm, said that since 1995, bin Laden has tried to protect hiscommunications with a “full suite of tools”, but “the codes were broken”, USofficials said.55 I thought these 9/11 attacks were being planned by bin Ladenfor years? How did he do this without, it seems, mentioning it in any of thecommunications monitored by the national security apparatus of the United Stateswith an annual budget of more than $30 billion? Did he organise it by telepathyor what? Village Voice journalist Russ Kick in his article detailing the priorwarning of the 9/11 attacks described the situation perfectly:> “The US has the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of> Investigation, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency,> the National Reconnaissance Office, the Secret Service, and a host of other> intelligence and security agencies. These agencies employ Echelon, which> monitors the majority of electronic communication in the world; Carnivore,> which intercepts email; Tempest, a technology that can read a computer> monitor’s display from over a block away; Keyhole satellites that have a> resolution of four inches; and other spy technologies, probably most of which> we don’t know about. In 2001, the US spent $30 billion on intelligence> gathering and an additional $12 billion on counterterrorism. With all of these> resources, and more, we’re supposed to believe that the government didn’t have> the slightest inkling that terrorists were planning to attack the United> States, much less hijack planes and send them careering into major landmarks.”> 56Stan Goff, a former US Special Forces Master Sergeant, trained troops in the artof planning and warfare. This is his view:> “This cartoon heavy they’ve turned bin Laden into makes no sense, when you> begin to appreciate the complexity and synchronicity of the attacks. As a> former military person who’s been involved in the development of countless> operations orders over the years, I can tell you that this was a very> sophisticated and costly enterprise that would have left what we call a huge> ‘signature’. In other words, it would be very hard to effectively conceal.” 57Unless, of course, those who should have been defending America from suchattacks were the ones who were planning them. Bin Laden’s first reaction to thecoordinated and pre-arranged allegations against him was to deny involvement. Hetold the Karachi-based Ummat newspaper:> “I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the> United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no> knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women,> children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids> causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is> forbidden even in the course of battle. It is the United States which is> perpetrating every maltreatment on women, children and common people.” 58The latter is quite obviously true and it may well be correct that he knewnothing about the attacks, unless the CIA told him, but the rest of it does notfit the bin Laden profile in Afghanistan, Kosovo and elsewhere. I just can’t seehim going about his business never telling a lie or worrying about the effect on“innocent women, children, and other humans”. What about the torture and murderof innocent women by the Taliban regime that he helped to fund, arm, andmaintain in power? It’s bollocks Osama, absolute bollocks. But was he the“mastermind” behind the September 11th attacks? You must be joking. JournalistRobert Fisk has met bin Laden in both Sudan and Afghanistan, and he wrote in theUK Independent the day after the attacks: “If Mr bin Laden was really guilty ofall the things for which he has been blamed, he would need an army of 10,000.”59 Fisk went on:> “His supporters would gather round him with the awe of men listening to a> messiah. And the words they listened to were fearful in their implications.> American civilians would no more be spared than military targets. Yet I also> remember one night when Mr bin Laden saw a pile of newspapers in my bag and> seized them. By a sputtering oil lamp, he read them clearly unaware of the> world around him. Was this really a man who could damage America?”Bin Laden is a CIA stooge, manipulated to his bootstraps, should he wear them.He was used to front up the Afghanistan war with the Soviet Union and he’s beenused to front up the terrorist camps full of CIA-trained Islamic fanatics fromaround the world. These misguided, mind-controlled, pawns like bin Laden and hisfollowers, are used as diversions and convenient villains to hide those who arereally behind the terrorist attacks of the last decade. These attacks haveadvanced the Illuminati agenda of centralised control and the dismantling ofbasic freedoms, and never more so than since 9/11. It could well be that binLaden, if he’s still alive, is largely unaware that he is a carefully createdfall guy and it is far from impossible that he may actually believe thatoperatives connected to his network were responsible. It may be that he knowshe’s a patsy. He may even be a willing one and that is why he was allowed toescape from Afghanistan and the US and British governments suddenly lostinterest in finding him. It may be that he is already dead and that we have beentreated to a series of clones or look-alikes since September 11th. Nothing isworth dismissing in this high-tech Alice in Wonderland without investigating theevidence first. Personally, I would not trust for a second the Al-Jazeera TVstation in Qatar, the “Arabic CNN”, which has been the source of bin Laden’svideo statements about the attacks and their aftermath. Qatar is an Americanpuppet state and home to the biggest storage base for the US military outside ofAmerica.60 Al-Jazeera was launched in 1996 and financed by the Emir of Qatar,Sheikh Hamad Bin-Khalifah Al Thani. After an approach from Vice PresidentCheney, the Emir ensured that Al-Jazeera did not broadcast a video interviewwith bin Laden in October 2001. Are we really supposed to believe that an Emirand a state so close to the US government is going to be allowed to broadcastinformation that really harms the interests of those controlling the Americanadministration? Of course not. What they broadcast is largely what suits theBush crowd to broadcast – including the “video statements” by the man claimed tobe Osama bin Laden after September 11th. We don’t even know if it is, that isonly what we are told. How do we know? Through these Al-Jazeera statements bybin Laden he has sung a rather different tune to his initial claims of notwanting to harm innocent civilians. He has welcomed and gloried in the attacks,while never actually claiming responsibility for them. In one pre-recordedstatement, broadcast when the bombing of Afghanistan began, he said:> “God Almighty hit the United States at its most vulnerable spot … When> Almighty God rendered successful a convoy of Muslims, the vanguards of Islam,> He allowed them to destroy the United States. I ask God Almighty to elevate> their status and grant them Paradise.” 61Not coincidentally, these “statements” came at just the right time to boost theBush-Blair campaign that was seeking support for the bombing and invasion ofAfghanistan. Osama bin Laden was not the mastermind behind the attacks onSeptember 11th and so Bush, Blair and their criminal conspiracy have never beenable to produce the evidence that he was. Instead they have had to reply onlies, bluff and manipulation, and the knowledge that people have short memoriesand succumb very easily to the conditioned reality that results from simplerepetition.SOURCES > 1US ‘Planned Attack on Taleban’, BBC News Online, September 18th 2001> 2Guardian, September 22nd 2001> 3Ibid> 4Ibid> 5Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth> 6Zbigniew Brzezinski, The Grand Chessboard, American Primacy and it’s> Geostrategic Imperatives (Basic Books, 1997)> 7Ibid, p 40> 8How CIA Tried to Save Afghan Guerilla, Washington Post, October 29th 2001> 9Guardian, November 2nd 2001, full transcript at> http://www.ceip.org/files/Publications/lievendispatch-haq.asp?from=pubdate> [http://www.ceip.org/files/Publications/lievendispatch-haq.asp?from=pubdate]> 10Times of India, October 29th 2001> 11The Tragedy of Abdul Haq, How the CIA betrayed an Afghan freedom-fighter, by> Robert McFarlane, Wall Street Journal, November 2nd, 2001> http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001406> [http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001406]> 12The Indian SAPRA news agency, May 22nd 2001> 13Statement released on September 14th 2001> 14http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2000> [http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2000]> 15Answer to journalist’s question to Secretary of State Colin Powell, State> Department Briefing, September 13th 2001> 16Agence France Press, October 10th 2001> 17India Helped FBI Trace ISI-terrorist Links, Times of India, October 12th> 2001> 18Guardian, September 29th 2001> 19Royal Navy press release, September 2001> 20http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html [http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html]> 21Le Nouvel Observateur, January 15th – 21st 1998, p 76> 22Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central> Asia (Yale University Press, January 2000)> 23Al Martin, The Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran-Contra Insider (New Improved> Entertainment Corporation, August 2001)> 24All Fall Down, p 70> 25http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm> [http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1997/vo13no05/vo13no05_assets.htm]> 26How a Holy War Against the Soviets turned on US, by Ahmed Rashid, Pittsburgh> Post-Gazette, September 23rd 2001, Two Star edition, p A-12> 27The Truth and Lies of 9/11, video recording of Michael Ruppert speaking at> Portland State University, November 28th 2001> 28Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, p 166> 29Ibid, p 201> 30Newsweek, October 13th 1997> 31Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, p 166> 32Ibid, p 179> 33How America Courted the Taliban, by Ishtiaq Ahmad, Pakistan Observer,> October 20th 2001> 34Richard Helms’s Afghani Niece Leads Corps of Taliban Reps and the Accidental> Operative by Camelia Fard and James Ridgeway,> http://www.villagevoice.com/newsletter/popup.php> [http://www.villagevoice.com/newsletter/popup.php]> 35Ibid> 36Hearing of the House International Relations Committee on Global Terrorism> and South Asia, July 12th 2000> 37http://emperors-clothes.com> [http://emperors-clothes.com]http://emperors-clothes.com> [http://emperors-clothes.com]> 38How a Holy War against the Soviets Turned on US”, by Ahmed Rashid,> Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 23rd 2001, Two Star edition, p A-12> 39http://www.tenc.net/news/probestop-i.htm> [http://www.tenc.net/news/probestop-i.htm]> 40Frontline, show number 1112, The Arming of Saudi Arabia, February 16th 1993> 41KLA Rebels Train in Terrorist Camps, Washington Times, May 4th 1999> 42Ibid> 43Ibid> 44Reported in the Charleston Gazette, November 30th 1998, p 2A> 45http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2002/02/08/forbidden/print.html> [http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2002/02/08/forbidden/print.html]> 46Press statement, September 14th 2001> 47Washington Post, October 3rd 2001> 48Ibid> 49Le Figaro, November 1st 2001> 50New Yorker, January 21st 2002> 51NSA Listens to bin Laden, UPI, February 13th 2001> 52Echelon Gave Authorities 3 Month Warning Of Attacks – German Paper,> Newsbytes.com [http://www.newsbytes.com], September 13th 2001> 53Baltimore Sun, April 24th 2001> 54NSA listens to bin Laden, UPI, February 13th 2001> 55Ibid> 56Russ Kick, Village Voice, September 2001> 57http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html [http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html]> 58Ummat, September 28th 2001> 59Robert Fisk, Is the World’s Favourite Hate Figure to Blame?, Independent,> September 12th 2001> 60ArabicNews.com [http://www.arabicnews.com] Qatar-USA, Politics, November> 24th 1998> 61BBC News Online, October 7th 2001"},{"pageContent":"chapter 14“Bin Laden did it” “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence,clamorous to be led to safety, by menacing it with an endless series ofhobgoblins – all of them imaginary.”Henry Louis MenckenOsama bin Laden is not considered guilty of the September 11th attacks becauseof the evidence against him. How could he be? None worth a dime in a court ofjustice has been presented. He is, instead, guilty by repetition – therepetition of the claim that he is guilty. That’s it. But then, as we have seen,Adolf Hitler said:> “The masses indulge in petty falsehoods every day, but it would never come> into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths and they are not able to> believe in the possibility of such monstrous effrontery … The bigger the lie,> therefore, the more likely it is to be believed … Besides, even the most> insolent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed> down.” 1What a summary of September 11th and its aftermath. The Nazi techniques arebeing used today because the same mentality and network is in power. When theTaliban were told by Bush to hand over bin Laden (“please don’t, we want to bombyou”) they asked for important little details from the US, like the evidencethat he was responsible. President Bush’s reaction encapsulates the fasciststate unfolding before our eyes: “There’s no need to discuss innocence or guilt,we know he’s guilty.” 2 Secretary of State Colin Powell said that bin Laden wasdefinitely to blame and they would be producing compelling evidence to prove it.But they never did. When the time came to reveal this “evidence” Powell said hecould not make the information public because it was “classified”. Yes and filedunder “piece of crap”. But the Illuminati agenda demanded brutal attacks on theAfghan people and they had to generate public and political support for theinvasion. To do that they needed people to believe that the Afghanistan-basedbin Laden was responsible for 9/11 and it was left to Tony Blair, the UK’sIlluminati Prime Minister, to try to kid the public with the “evidence” thatnever was.The Blair “dossier”Blair read a “dossier” to a compliant House of Commons on October 3rd 2001,watched by the non-researching, unquestioning, “leaders of the opposition” inthe Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties. If either really thought it was ascam (no evidence that they did) they would not have had the guts to say sobecause of the perceived effect on their political prospects. The openingsentence of this “dossier of evidence” against bin Laden was a classic: “Thisdocument does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against Usama bin Ladenin a court of law.” No, Mr Blair, but it is more than enough to justify themurder of at least 5,000 Afghan men, women and children, who had nothingwhatsoever to do with bin Laden, isn’t it? Blair and Bush are war criminals andto a far greater extent than those they condemn and put on show trials like theformer Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who may not be a nice man to say theleast, but he is not in the class of Blair and the Bush family when it comes tothe slaughter of the innocent. The 21-page document that claimed to show thatbin Laden was responsible was summed up in an article by former US SpecialForces Master Sergeant Stan Goff:> “The so-called evidence is a farce. The US presented Tony Blair’s puppet> government with the evidence, and of the 70 so-called points of evidence, only> nine even referred to the attacks on the World Trade Center, and those points> were conjectural. This is a bullshit story from beginning to end. Presented> with the available facts, any 16-year old with a liking for courtroom dramas> could tear this story apart like a two-dollar shirt. But our corporate press> regurgitates it uncritically. But then, as we should know by now, their role> is to legitimize.” 3This Blair “report” was compiled by such trustworthy organisations as MI5 andMI6, with their drafts going to Washington and the CIA for approval. Would thesepeople lie to you? Surely not. As you would expect, the “report” is full of mindgames to hide the simple fact that the hard evidence it produced to support the“bin Laden did it” campaign was, er, zilch. Instead of that, we have lines like:“The clear conclusions reached by the government are: Osama bin Laden and AlQaida, the terrorist network which he heads, planned and carried out theatrocities on 11 September 2001.” The bigger the lie the more will believe itand the more you repeat the lie the more effective it will be. The Blair“evidence” document says that: “Usama Bin Laden [was] … linked to the attack onthe USS Cole on 12 October 2000, in which 17 crew members were killed and 40others injured”.4 What he doesn’t say is that the FBI was blocked by Bush frominvestigating that involvement. The document is page after page of oldinformation not related to the events of September 11th and the brief referencesto those attacks are unsubstantiated allegations with no sources presented. Atone point Blair said that three of the 19 hijackers had been “positivelyidentified as associates of Al Qaida” and one had been “identified as playingkey roles in both the East African embassy attacks and the USS Cole attack”.First of all what is meant by an “associate” and second, as we have seen, thehead of the FBI has admitted that he cannot prove who the “hijackers” reallywere. Look at how many the FBI named – and continues to name – who are stillalive. The man Blair links to the embassy and Cole attacks is supposed to beKhalid al-Midhar or Mihdhar. But, as the UK Guardian reported, this man’sidentity is the subject of much confusion because it was believed that he wasusing several aliases and, the paper said, American investigators “are not evencertain that his name is really Khalid al-Mihdhar.” 5 How can the FBI be socertain that Khalid al-Mihdhar was on Flight 77 and make a link between him andbin Laden? In fact, according to Arab News, a young Saudi computer programmercalled Khalid Al-Mihammadi had “the shock of his life when he saw that hispicture was among the suspects who had hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 thatcrashed into the Pentagon in Washington on Sept. 11”.6 The picture was claimedby the FBI to be al-Mihdhar, but it appears to have been Al-Mihammadi, who hadstudied English in the United States for nine months and returned to SaudiArabia earlier that year.Blair also said in his statement of “evidence” that they had learned sinceSeptember 11th that bin Laden “himself asserted shortly before 11 September thathe was preparing a major attack on America”. He gave no source as usual, butthis “evidence” would appear to be the claim that bin Laden telephoned hismother in Syria the day before the attacks to say there was going to be some“big news” and he might not be contactable for some time. Can you really imaginehim doing that on the day before the attacks were due to take place? Are we tobelieve that the CIA was not tapping the phones of bin Laden’s family andassociates if they really were trying to catch him? Why didn’t they know of thecall before the attacks, then? Bin Laden’s mother, Alia Ghanem, said in anewspaper interview that he had not called her in six years for the very reasonof preventing his location being traced.7 The get-out clause for Blair andPowell when they were asked for real evidence was always the same. Blair toldthe House of Commons: “There is evidence of a very specific nature relating tothe guilt of bin Laden and his associates that is too sensitive to release.” Oh,so we just have to trust you then, Tone? Don’t think so mate. This nonsense wassupported by Lord Robertson, the Secretary General of NATO, Bilderberger, andformer Defence Secretary in the Blair government. Perhaps the most laughablestatement by Blair, and it had plenty of competition, was when he claimed, “Noother organisation has both the motivation and the capability to carry outattacks like those of the 11 September – only the Al Qaida network under Usamabin Laden.” What about the United States national “security” network with its$30 billion a year official budget, plus all the profits from drugs and othercovert operations? This has fundamental connections with the vast US militaryand government machine and other intelligence networks like Britishintelligence, German intelligence and Mossad. It is a grouping with the power,money, and technology both to carry out the attacks and to block the normalsecurity response that allowed them to happen. Are they more likely to be ableto pull off such a highly professional operation, or a guy in a cave of whomjournalist Robert Fisk wrote: “… Mr bin Laden saw a pile of newspapers in my bagand seized them … By a sputtering oil lamp, he read them clearly unaware of theworld around him”? Three months before 9/11, Tony Karon took the same line inhis analysis of bin Laden in Time magazine:> “… The media’s picture of Bin Laden sitting in a high-tech Bat cave in the> mountains around Kandahar ordering up global mayhem at the click of a mouse is> more than a little ludicrous. Yes, the various networks of Islamist terror> have made full use of the possibilities presented by technology and> globalization. But few serious intelligence professionals believe Bin Laden is> the puppet-master atop a pyramid structure of terror cells. It’s really not> that simple, but personalizing the threat – while it distorts both the nature> of the problem and the remedy – is a time-honored tradition.

And does anyone even remember the chubby jowls of Carlos the Jackal,> whose image drawn from an old passport picture was once the icon of global> terror?”8Wag the “bin Laden” videoWith more and more questions being asked about the lack of evidence to justifyattacks on Afghanistan, a stone-age country in the middle of a famine, theBush-Blair terrorism network had an amazing piece of good luck. Just when theyneeded it, the bin Laden “confession” video turned up. Phew, what a relief. The“confession” is like a scene from the 1998 movie Wag The Dog,9 which is so closeto the truth. A US president is about to face an election for a second term whenhis aides realise that the story of a sexual affair is about to hit the press.They hire a Hollywood producer played by Dustin Hoffman to create a non-existentUS war with Albania to take news of the affair off the front pages. They pickAlbania because they figure no one in America would even know where it was orcertainly nothing about the place. There is no actual war; they just kid thepeople that there is. It all takes place in a movie studio where interviews and“war footage” are created and then handed to the television news networks as“footage from the front.” If you haven’t seen the movie, I would recommend yougive it a look. In the end, with the “war” won and the president re-elected, theHoffman character threatens to spill the beans. He is then led away by large mento a blacked-out car never to be seen again. It is so close to what reallyhappens even though it is portrayed as a comedy.Hollywood or “holy-warred”Hollywood and the Illuminati have always been hand in hand and the place of“magic” has been used from the start as a massive weapon in global propagandaand mind conditioning. Let’s be fair, it is from Hollywood that most people gettheir “history”, an outrageous distortion most of it, but extremely beneficialto the agenda. After September 11th, Bush dispatched Karl Rove, his chiefpolitical adviser, to meet 45 of Hollywood’s top players, including executivesfrom all the main studios, at the Peninsular Hotel in Beverly Hills. There theyformed the Hollywood 911 committee to tell the world the Gospel according toWashington. The movie-makers were told they could have access to military sites,aircraft carriers, almost anything they wanted, so long as their productions didnot criticise the government.10 Bush adviser Mark McKinnon told the BBC’sNewsnight programme without once bursting into laughter:> “We don’t want to, or intend to, turn Hollywood into a propaganda machine.> It’s not in the long-term interests for the effort, Hollywood, or this> administration. This administration is very first-amendment minded. This> President has no interest in telling people what to do, what to say, or how to> say it.” 11So they want to use Hollywood as a propaganda machine and tell people what todo, what to say and how to say it, then? Gotcha. Jack Valenti, President of theMotion Picture Association of America, said: “We are at war. If I was in theWhite House, I’d reach out to the most powerful persuaders on earth, the movieindustry, and ask, “What can you do to help?” What can they do? What Bush wantsthem to do, of course, is to tell lies like they have since Hollywood wasfounded, although there are honourable exceptions that have tried to turn thetide. Among them is Larry Gelbart, the creator of M*A*S*H, the brilliant seriesabout the Korean War. He said of the government’s overtures to Hollywood: “It iseasy to talk out of the other side of your mouth when you are two-faced. Youhave got this extra mouth. They want it all ways.” 12 Yes they do, and some bigplayers in Hollywood from studio owners and down through the various disciplinesare working to advance the Bush propaganda. All this brings me to the bin Laden“smoking gun” video.With the evidence non-existent to pin the rap on bin Laden, and with an invasionof Afghanistan to justify, it was no surprise that the bin Laden “confession”would drop from the heavens. It is said by official Pentagon statements to havebeen shot at a “guest house in Kandahar” and was “found in an abandoned privatehouse in Jalalabad”. By whom, pray? Well that depends on which officialspokesman you listen to. In fact most of the story of 9/11 depends on that. Wehave been variously told that the bin Laden tape was found by the US Navy, theUS Army, the “United Front” (Northern Alliance), the “military” and the CIA.More details, please? Er, sorry, classified. The video is claimed to have beenshot on November 9th 2001. President Bush is said to have viewed the tape onNovember 30th, the Washington Post “broke” (officially leaked) the story of itsexistence on December 9th, and the rest of us saw bits of it on December 13th.The tape is around 40 minutes long and of very poor quality, which suits themanipulation perfectly. It includes shots of a downed helicopter in Ghazniprovince and two sections of a man claimed to be bin Laden talking to a Saudicleric and others at a “dinner”. Strangely, the tape had the first part of the“bin Laden” conversation at the end of the tape, the end of the conversation atthe start, with the helicopter footage in between. Maybe Afghan video cameraswhirl the other way, like Chinese writing. Or perhaps they shot the end of theconversation last, then went out and filmed the helicopter, before returning toshoot the start of the conversation. Yep, that must be it. We were told that theUS government used the latest voice and face identification techniques (to checkit or make it?), and a team of Arabic translators, none of them familiar withthe Saudi language, spent days listening to the tape to make sure theconversations were accurately translated. Why didn’t they succeed then? It isnot accurately translated, as confirmed by State Department consultantChristopher Ross, and if that is the face of the “Osama bin Laden” we have beenseeing elsewhere then he must have placed a very large order with the KandaharCream Cake Company and been visited by a doctor from the Jalalabad Nose JobClinic – “cave visits a speciality” (Figure 27). But we shouldn’t mock, they aredoing their best, and after all President Bush said:> “This is bin Laden unedited. It’s preposterous for anybody to think that this> tape is doctored. That’s just a feeble excuse to provide weak support for an> incredibly evil man.”image [../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 27: “Fatty bin Laden” on the CIA home video Quite right, George, and I would ask your dad to pass that on next time hevisits the bin Laden family. British Foreign Secretary, Jack “straw man” Straw,said there was “no doubt it is the real thing” and this is perhaps the finalconfirmation that it isn’t. A German television programme called Monitor, on theDas Erste channel, asked two independent translators and an expert in orientalstudies to analyse the US government translation. They found it to be“inaccurate” and “manipulative”. One of the programme’s translators, Dr Abdel ElM. Husseini, said that he had carefully examined the Pentagon’s translation andfound many problems with it. “At the most important places where it is held toprove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic,” he said.13Oh goodness, I am surprised. He said that in Arabic the word “previous” does notappear in the sentence in which the official translation claims to say: “We hadnotification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place thatday.” Dr Murad Alami, another translator on the programme, said the allegedstatement that the attacks would take place “on that day” cannot be heard in theoriginal Arabic version. Garnet Ratter, professor of Islamic and Arabic Studiesat the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg, told the programme:“The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed themapparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot beheard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it.” Bin Laden’s motherwas quoted by Britain’s Mail on Sunday as saying the tape was a fake. “The voiceis unclear and uneven. There are too many gaps and the statements are veryunlike him”, she said.14 On the tape the “bin Laden” figure appears to say,according to the official translation, that most of the hijackers did not knowthe details of the operation until just before they boarded the planes:> “The brothers, who conducted the operation, all they knew was that they have a> martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to America but they didn’t> know anything about the operation, not even one letter. But they were trained> and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just> before they boarded the planes … (inaudible) … Those who were trained to fly> didn’t know the others.”Are we to believe that after “years of planning” most of those involved wereonly given the essential details in the few minutes before they boarded theplanes for a “brilliantly executed operation”? “Hey, Abdul, quick, we don’t havemuch time. You know those two big towers in New York? Well …” What trash. Whereis the video footage at Washington Dulles and Newark New Jersey of these“hijackers” being told the plan? Nowhere. It couldn’t have happened like thatand yet here is “bin Laden” saying that it did. The tape translation has the binLaden figure saying that he had been informed of the date of the attacks inadvance. Well I guess as the “mastermind” he would have to be told it washappening. The figure says it was 5.30pm when he heard the news on the radiothat the first plane had hit the World Trade Center and he had told the peoplewith him that they should be patient, the implication being that he knew therewould be others. The “bin Laden” figure then says that he continued to listen tothe radio. What happened to his satellite television that visiting journalistshave talked about? Would he not on that of all days have made sure CNN wasswitched on and ready? Or at least tuned to that when the events began? Insteadhe sits listening to the radio while the rest of the world watches live what heis supposed to have orchestrated.The translation also has “bin Laden” saying that he did not expect the twotowers to collapse as they did. He thought that the fire would undermine theiron structure of the building and that three or four storeys would collapse.Isn’t it strange that a man who comes from one of the biggest constructionfamilies in the Middle East should not think that three or four storeys fallingon those below would threaten the whole building if that was how it is supposedto have happened? Why would he “confess” on tape? Why take that chance? It hasbeen suggested that it was done as a recruitment video, but (a) that means the“confession” would have been widely circulated and a copy would eventually havefallen in the wrong hands, and (b) why would they record a “recruitment video”on such a crap camera with such crap quality when we are told he has limitlessfunds? None of this makes any sense because it isn’t true. By the time the videois said to have been shot on November 9th, the Taliban were in serious trouble.The country was being carpet-bombed by the US and Britain, and on that day theNorthern Alliance claimed to have won the battle for the strategic town ofMazar-e-Sharif. The capital, Kabul, would fall within days. Yet at no time inthe whole tape does bin Laden or anyone else mention the US invasion, thebombing, the Taliban’s retreat, or the alleged pursuit of the man himself. Onceagain – uh?“Bin Laden” is also claimed to say on the tape that Mohamed Atta was the leaderof the hijackers, but he does not say that at all. He speaks only of Mohamed,hardly a rare name among Muslims, and bin Laden would have said that name manytimes in recorded conversations. The name “Atta” did not leave his lips. The binLaden figure says: “Mohamed from the Egyptian family was in charge of thegroup.” The name “Atta” only comes in the translated subtitles on the broadcastversion, which says: “Muhammad (Atta) from the Egyptian family (meaning the AlQa’ida Egyptian group), was in charge of the group.” The translation is pepperedwith these in-bracket comments that are not on the soundtrack. The term“inaudible” appears over and over on the subtitles when they could notunderstand what was said even after playing the tape back dozens of times andlater another 50 times more. Significantly, many of these “inaudibles” come atthe start of sentences. It is all a manipulator’s dream. A skilled editor cantake someone’s words and change the order to make them say what they didn’t saybefore. An audiotape of George W. Bush was sent to my website in which he openlydeclares his intentions for a fascist state. What he said was true, but hedidn’t actually say it like that. His words from other speeches and statementshad been re-edited to make it sound as if he had said that. The result wasamazingly good, and imagine what Hollywood could do. In fact, Hani Al Sibaei, aspecialist in Islamic affairs, told Al-Jazeera television that thecongratulatory wishes on the tape and bin Laden’s happy expression were takenfrom a tape of bin Laden being congratulated on the marriage of one hischildren, which happened four years earlier. Al Sibaei described the “bin Ladenconfession” as “fabricated and a scandal for the greatest democratic country inthe world”.15 Not sure about the last bit, but you get his drift. With voicerecognition technology they would have another means of mimicking the sound ofthe voice and with the Arabic audio so poor and difficult to hear this would bevery straightforward for an expert. There are no close-ups of lips on the video,making it even easier to manipulate.Seeing is believing?I remember watching the movie Stuart Little with my son a few years ago. It is astory about a mouse living with a human family. The cats in the neighbourhood,real ones not animations, speak to each other like humans and it struck mewatching the mouths move so perfectly with the words that the days of believingwhat you are seeing, even with an apparent television interview or statement,are long over. If they can do that with cats, what could they do with humans?When the actor Oliver Reed died during the filming of the movie Gladiator he wasreplaced in the rest of the film by a computer-generated image of himself. Wehave also seen in advertisements and movies like Forrest Gump how actors todaycan be seen chatting and shaking hands with people long dead. Sean Broughton, adirector of Smoke and Mirrors, one of Britain’s top visual effects companies,said it would be relatively easy for a skilled professional to fake the video ofbin Laden. First they would transfer the original video images on to film tape,he said. The distortion, or “noise” and graininess, would be removed and a“morphing package” would be used to manipulate the image on a computer screen.It would be possible to change the person’s mouth and expressions to fitwhatever soundtrack they chose and finally the “noise” and graininess would bereturned and the whole thing transferred back to videotape.16 Smoke and Mirrorsused this technique to put Bill Clinton’s head on an actor for an advertisementfor a United States insurance company. Broughton said there were perhaps 20people in America who would be good enough to fool everybody, but “to findsomeone that good and make sure they kept quiet would probably be prettydifficult”.17 Not for the Illuminati it wouldn’t. Philip Taylor, Director of theInstitute of Communications at Leeds University in England and the author ofMunitions of the Mind, a History of Propaganda, said US military leaders hadonce suggested to him intercepting a live broadcast of Saddam Hussein “andmorphing a blonde on one arm and a bottle of scotch on the other”.18 Theydecided against doctoring the video, he said, because of its extraordinarypotential price – ruining US credibility forever if they were found out. GregStrause, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Pixel Envy, a company involved withspecial effects on the movie Titanic, said: “That’s how we make our money, kindof faking things to convince everyone else it’s real. We just did some Nikecommercials where half the people are digital. You wouldn’t be able to pick themout.” 19 Henry Hingson, a former President of the National Association ofCriminal Defence Lawyers, said that in this day and age of digital wizardry,many things could be done to alter the video.20 Bob Crabtree, Editor of themagazine Computer Video, said it was impossible to judge whether the video was afake without more details of its source. “The US seems simply to have asked theworld to trust them that it is genuine.” 21There are some other puzzling aspects of the tape. The Pentagon says it was shotin mid-November, although reports say it carries a date of November 9th. Thecleric with “bin Laden” says he journeyed to the location on a night of a fullmoon, but the full moons at that time were on October 31st and November 30th,long before and even longer after the tape was supposed to have been recorded.The cleric, who was a paraplegic, would have had to make his alleged journey ofsome five hours or more from Kabul to Kandahar while the intensive US bombingand the anti-Taliban forces of the Northern Alliance were sweeping the country.Pakistan Commander Ghamsharik apparently reported on November 23rd that binLaden dined with Pakistanis in Jalalabad on November 9th and stayed there untilthe 13th.22 If that is so, how could he also be in Kandahar on the 9th makinghis video “confession”? “Bin Laden” appears to have a ring on his right hand inthe video while in his other appearances he only wore a watch and theleft-handed bin Laden is seen to be gesturing a lot and making notes with hisright hand in the “confession”.A Daily Telegraph story two months after the attacks claimed the existence of avideo in which bin Laden “admitted that his al-Qa’eda group carried out theattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon”.23 In the alleged videointerview with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir, “shot in the Afghan mountains atthe end of October”, a “smiling bin Laden goes on to say that the World TradeCenter’s twin towers were a ‘legitimate target’ and the pilots who hijacked theplanes were ‘blessed by Allah’”. The deaths of thousands of people werejustified by bin Laden, the Telegraph claimed, because they were “not civilians”and were working for the American system. “If avenging the killing of our peopleis terrorism then history should be a witness that we are terrorists,” bin Ladenis quoted as saying. “Yes, we kill their innocents and this is legal religiouslyand logically.” The Telegraph report says that in the video bin Laden alsoclaims responsibility for an “unspecified terrorist outrage in Riyadh, SaudiArabia, which he claims was sparked by secret messages in one of his videos”. Headmits for the first time, said the Telegraph, that he was using publicstatements on video to “whip up terrorism” and this was “a danger about whichthe British and American governments have warned broadcasters.” A few thingscome to mind here. If this video is so damning, why haven’t we seen iteverywhere? How strange that bin Laden would be denying involvement in theattacks in one interview and then admitting them in another and allowing it allto be videoed. The Telegraph noted that bin Laden had publicly issued fourprevious videos since September 11th and always denied carrying out theatrocities. Why would he admit that he was using some kind of code on his videosto communicate to terrorist cells? What would be the point of making this publicand alerting people to what you were doing, thus preventing any further use ofthe technique? What a coincidence that he should “say” this after the US andBritish governments had used the claim that he was doing this to pressurebroadcasters into limiting the footage of bin Laden that the public is allowedto see.Then there was the September 11th “hijacker” “confessing” to the attacks in atirade to camera that is said to have been recorded on March 6th 2001, some sixmonths before 9/11. Guess who “released” the tape? Al-Jazeera television, the“Arab CNN”, based in US-controlled Qatar. The station claimed to have “received”the tape in April 2002, but would not say from what source. The “hijacker” wasnamed as Ahmad al-Haznawi al-Ghamdi. This “hijacker” speaks to camera ongood-quality footage as if he is sitting in a television studio and, mostbizarrely, behind him are images of the burning World Trade Center. This wassupposed to have been shot six months before the attacks! So, if that iscorrect, Al-Jazeera has electronically added the background of the burning WTC.Why? They claimed it was the “first proof” that al-Qaeda was behind the attacks,so why doctor this “proof” in such a bizarre manner? Why not give us theoriginal footage? Why would this guy record a video six months before theattacks warning that the fight against the United States would be taken toAmerican soil? “The time has come to prove to the whole world,” he says, “thatthe United States put on a garb that was not tailored for it when it had themere thought of resisting the Mujahadin.” The United States did not resist theMujahadin, it funded and armed them, and why would a carefully planned andsecret operation to attack targets in the United States be revealed by one ofthe hijackers on tape six months before the day? Crazy. But most people believeit and to the Illuminati that is all that matters. On the same Al-Jazeera tapeis claimed to be the al-Qaeda second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, and a silentOsama bin Laden. The alleged Zawahri calls the September 11th attacks a “a greatvictory” and adds: “This great victory was achieved only thanks to the grace ofGod the Almighty, not due to any skill or competence on our part.” At least thelast bit is true. There will, no doubt, be other “finds” when the Illuminatioperatives in government and the military want to manipulate the public mind tosupport the agenda, and there will certainly be other “terrorist attacks” forthe same reason, not least with chemicals and disease.Suffer the little children …It was on the non-existent “evidence” detailed here that the world allowed thementally disturbed leadership in the United States and Britain to launch theirmerciless attacks on Afghanistan civilians. What a statement about the humancondition and how easy it is for the few to control and dictate to the many.Richard Lloyd Parry wrote in the UK Independent of the death and suffering thathe witnessed in Afghanistan. He told of Sami Ullah who was asleep when the braveboys from the “war on terrorism” bombed a residential area of Tarin Kot. Parrywrote: “In the 11 hours between the explosion and the moment when he finallyregained consciousness, the bodies of Mr Ullah’s wife, his four children, hisparents, and five of his brothers and sisters had been lifted from the rubble oftheir home and buried.” 24 So it went on across the country. They even droppedwhat passed for “food aid” in yellow packets that were the same colour and shapeas the cluster bombs with which they were killing indiscriminately. How manydied because they thought a cluster bomb was the food they were so desperate forafter the normal supplies had been stopped by the bombing campaign? All this ina country that already had half a million widows and half a million orphans withlimbs lost to wars and the more than ten million landmines that pepper thelandscape. The people who are running your world and the stupid juveniles who dotheir bidding from the skies are deeply, deeply disturbed and require someserious mental, emotional and spiritual healing. Major General Smedley Butlerwas twice awarded the Medal of Honor while serving for more than 30 years in theUnited States Marine Corps. He encapsulated the real nature of war in a speechin July 1933 in which he said that war is just a racket conducted by the veryfew at the expense of masses and that only a small group on the inside knowswhat it is really all about. He went on:> “Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my> own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended> animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with> everyone in the military service. I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico,> safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent> place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the> raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall> Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown> Brothers in 1909–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American> sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went> its way unmolested.” 25It is sobering to consider as the military go about their deadly business withtheir “faculties in suspended animation”, the kind of weaponry and destructivepower they have at their fingertips whenever a drug-running, child-abusing,psychopathic family like the Bushes tells them to go slaughter some unarmedpopulation of men, women, and children, who are terrorising no-one and just wishto live in peace. These uniformed, unthinking, “Yes sir” pawns in a game theydon’t understand, have at their disposal, for instance, the fuel-air bombsdescribed earlier by Wade Frazier:> “The bomb works thus: there are two detonations; the first spreads a fine mist> of fuel into the air, turning the area [about the size of a football field]> into an explosive mix of vast proportion; then a second detonation ignites the> mixture, causing an awesome explosion. The explosion is about the most> powerful ‘conventional’ explosion we know of.> “At a pressure shock of up to 200 pounds per square inch (PSI), people in its> detonation zone are often killed by the sheer compression of the air around> them. Human beings can typically withstand up to about a 40-PSI shock. The> bomb sucks oxygen out of the air, and can apparently even suck the lungs out> through the mouths of people unfortunate enough to be in the detonation zone.> Our military used it on helpless people [in the 1991 Gulf Slaughter].” 26Yes, and they used it in Afghanistan and they will use it anywhere they chooseuntil the human herd puts a spiritual rocket up its collective arse. Instead weallow into power intellects like the UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw who said onSeptember 28th 2001 that “the most fundamental civil liberty is the right tolife and preserving that and sustaining that must come before others” (when hewas justifying the removal of basic freedoms); and then on October 8th heconfirmed that UK and US strikes against Afghanistan had caused “considerabledamage” and warned they could continue for weeks (when he was supporting theslaughter of men, women, and children). How this man remembers to breathe hasalways been beyond me, but look at him, look at Bush, and ask what having themas “leaders” says about the people they dictate to. These are the kind of“leaders” the people of this planet have allowed to take the world into a war –the mass murder of whoever they chose – that in the words of Dick Cheney may notend in our lifetimes. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines terrorism as: “Onewho favours or uses terror-inspiring methods of governing or coercing governmentor community, hence terrorism.” A United States army manual says that terrorismis: “The calculated use of violence or the threat of violence to attainpolitical or religious ideological goals through intimidation, coercion, orinstilling fear.” 27 Under either definition, George Bush and Tony Blair areclassic terrorists along with all those who support their insane campaign ofmass slaughter.The “war” gameThe word “war” slips from the lips of politicians so easily, yet the people whohave never experienced it forget what that word really means. As the Japaneseleader Shogun Tokugawa said: “If you have to go to war you have already lost.”War is not some sanitised news report about “smart bombs” and cities “falling”.It is about dead children, dead mothers and fathers. It is about kids seeing thedismembered limbs of their mums and dads splattered all around them; it is aboutmums and dads seeing their children in the same state. It is about waking up tofind every member of your family is dead. My father was in the medical corpsduring the Second World War and he told me of the endless times they filledcoffins with ballast to give loved ones the impression there was a body insidewhen it was just the bits and pieces that were left. He told me how youngsoldiers in agony and afraid to die would be brought to the makeshift medicalcentres screaming for their mothers thousands of miles away. Simon Weston, theBritish soldier who suffered horrendous burns in the Falklands War thanks to thestupidity of his commanders, presented an excellent BBC documentary about thatwar in 2002. In it he said that there was no glory in war. When they killed you,he said, they were killing some mother’s son. When you killed them you weredoing the same. In Afghanistan, which is only the start of the “War on Sanity”being waged by the disturbed minds of Bush, Blair and their masters, there weremany more dead mothers’ sons and daughters, and there were thousands of deadkids and their mums and dads. That’s the reality that Bush and Blair are seekingto sell the world as “fighting for freedom”. A point that should never be lostis that they both know that’s what they are really doing.I say this to those “journalists”, the intellectual prostitutes who sell theirsouls and their minds to the official line, refusing to investigate the lieswhile arrogantly dismissing as “wingnuts” those who do: look at all the dead andmaimed children, and their mums and dads in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia andelsewhere, the victims of the wars and agenda that you close your eyes tobecause you don’t have the guts or the desire to expose what is really going on.Then look in the mirror and face one of the people responsible for thesehorrors. Yeah, you. I say to all those in the global population who cheer, lookthe other way, or refuse to make their voices heard: do the same. You are all asresponsible in your own way as Bush, Blair and the Illuminati and those bravelittle boys in their flying machines playing virtual reality games with realpeople whenever their masters say “jump”.The big lieThe official fairy story has been compiled from blatant lies and “evidence” thatwas so obviously planted and manufactured. The bin Laden “confession” tape isbut one example. There was also the “hijacker’s passport” “found” near the WorldTrade Center; Mohamed Atta’s “letter” and “baggage” that somehow failed to makeit on to Flight 11; and a long, long list of other nonsensical “evidence”detailed throughout this book. The UK Guardian reported that journalists haddescribed how they were directed to buildings in Kabul and other locations inAfghanistan to “find” apparent proof of al-Qaeda’s involvement in thehijackings. This included, the paper said, new box cutters still in theirpackaging and a freshly torn page from an American magazine detailing Floridaflying schools.28 How juvenile and obvious. Yet the media still reported these“discoveries” as if they were genuine. A simple question comes from this. If theofficial story is true, why have they had to manufacture so much “evidence” andtell so many provable lies to hold it all together? How can you believe anythingthese guys say given their life-long commitment to lying by reflex action? ThePentagon even set up an “Office of Strategic Influence [Lies]” after September11th to “help the United States get its story over,” said Defense SecretaryRumsfeld.29 Why they thought they needed to do that when the mainstream mediaoverwhelmingly reports their story without question says something about theridiculous nature of their claims. The Office of Strategic Lies was closed whenit was revealed to be proposing to use the Internet and other sources to spreaddisinformation. They do that anyway without any need for a new organisation.The manipulators know that most people do not retain details of events andstatements, only an image, a feeling. They know that people are mostly short onmemory and long on retaining an image. They are well aware that they can getaway with contradictions so long as the drip, drip, drip, of false informationfeeds the image in people’s minds of what happened. They did not need tosubstantiate the authenticity of the bin Laden “confession” tape and that’s goodbecause they knew they couldn’t. It was just used for a few days to feed the“image” at a crucial time when they needed the propaganda to justify bombingAfghanistan. Note that after the initial release of the tape, nothing has beenheard of it or reported about it or investigated further. There is only silence.The same with the hijacker “passport”, the anthrax scare, and all the other liesand manipulations. Play them to feed the public’s image of events and thenforget they ever happened. It is only when they are listed in books like thisthat the scale of the contradictions can be seen because, understandably, mostpeople have forgotten most of the detail they have been told about 9/11 and theyretain only the image of what happened: bin Laden did it.It is quite a statement about the current mental, emotional and spiritual stateof the human family when you consider the basis on which those thousands ofAfghan men, women and children, were slaughtered by the mentally derangedterrorists and cowards running the United States and British governments andtheir military. No evidence worthy of a court of justice was produced to provethat Osama bin Laden and the Taliban were involved in the attacks of September11th; not one of the alleged “hijackers” was an Afghan or has been connected tothe Afghan people; and some seven of the “hijackers” named by the FBI were foundto be still alive anyway. With the United States and British governments havingno evidence to support their long-planned intention to bomb the shit out ofAfghanistan, their front men, Bush and Blair, merely repeated over and over thepre-rehearsed mantra of lies and unsourced allegations. Their “target”, binLaden, has been a CIA asset and stooge for 20 years and the Taliban were funded,armed and manipulated into power by the CIA, Pakistan intelligence and the Saudiroyal family, all of which suddenly claimed to oppose them. Afghanistan was inthe middle of a horrendous drought and famine with average life expectancylittle more than 40. For a child to make it to adulthood was a seriousachievement in itself and it was, and is still more so today, a country ofwidows and orphans after the seemingly endless external and internal conflicts.Ladies and gentlemen of planet earth, those were the circumstances in which thebrave boys and girls of the United States and British military flew overAfghanistan at heights well beyond the range of the pop-gun Afghan air defencesand unleashed state-of-art technology of mass destruction on a stone-age countryin the middle of a famine. Yet most people just sat around and watched withoutprotest, many even cheered. That is the level to which we have sunk, the cesspitin which we continue to drown. People sat there, even cheering, when the fascistbombs of America and Britain were wiping out desperately poor and hungry Afghanfamilies, and everyone who did that is responsible for what happened andcontinues to happen.Excuse me a moment, I need a fucking drink.SOURCES > 1Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, pp 180–1, p 231, of the Manheim translation> 2Statement at the White House, October 14th 2001> 3http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html [http://www.narconews.com/goff1.html]> 4http://www.newsmedianews.com/wtc.htm [http://www.newsmedianews.com/wtc.htm]> 5UK Guardian, October 7th 2002> 6Arab News, September 27th 2001> 7Interview by Saudi journalist and bin Laden family friend Khalid Batarfi, the> editor of the Saudi newspaper, Al Medina, reported in the UK Mail on Sunday,> December 23rd 2001> 8Time.com [http://www.time.com] June 20th 2001> 9Wag The Dog, New Line Cinema, released January 9th 1998> 10BBC Newsnight, January 30th 2002> 11Ibid> 12Ibid> 13http://www.rense.com/general18/inac.htm> [http://www.rense.com/general18/inac.htm]> 14Interview by Saudi journalist and bin Laden family friend Khalid Batarfi,> the editor of the Saudi newspaper, Al Medina, reported in the UK Mail on> Sunday, December 23rd 2001> 15http://www.americanfreepress.net/12_21_01/Bin_Laden_Video/bin_laden_video.html> [http://www.americanfreepress.net/12_21_01/Bin_Laden_Video/bin_laden_video.html]> 16UK Guardian, December 16th 2001.> 17Ibid> 18Knight Ridder Service, December 16th 2001> 19Ibid> 20UK Guardian, December 16th 2001> 21Ibid> 22http://www.worldmessenger.20m.com/video.html> [http://www.worldmessenger.20m.com/video.html]> 23Daily Telegraph, November 12th 2001> 24UK Independent, October 25th 2001> 25All Fall Down, p 113> 26Wade Frazier, http://home1.gte.net/res0k62m/iraq.htm> [http://home1.gte.net/res0k62m/iraq.htm] Highly recommended for Iraq> background> 27All Fall Down, p 66> 28UK Guardian, December 14th 2001> 29The Province, Vancouver, February 27th 2002> http://www.worldmessenger.20m.com/video.html> [http://www.worldmessenger.20m.com/video.html]"},{"pageContent":"chapter 15Behind the movie “The interests behind the Bush Administration, such as the CFR, the TrilateralCommission – founded by Brzezinski for David Rockefeller – and the BilderbergGroup have prepared for and are now moving to implement open world dictatorshipwithin the next five years.”Dr Johannes Koeppl, former official of the German Ministry for Defence andadviser to NATOWhat happened on September 11th, its consequences and cover-up, is not someisolated, one-off nightmare that will eventually pass from our lives as theyears progress and memories fade. The deaths of 3,000 people in the UnitedStates and thousands more already killed and maimed in the “war on terrorism”are part of a coldly calculated plan for a global fascist state in which peoplewill be no more than micro-chipped pawns for a tiny cabal in need of psychiatrichelp. This plan has been unfolding for at least thousands of years in ourversion of “time” and I will explain how that is possible in due course. Thehorror of 9/11 is not “it”, just another step on the road to “it” – a globalfascist state.I have been researching and communicating this information since the early 1990sand warning of the very society now unfolding before our eyes. Thousands ofothers have been doing the same and far-sighted researchers were revealing theagenda decades ago. Most people ignored the warnings and others just laughed.But slowly at first, and now rapidly, there is a gathering body of people acrossthe world from a vast diversity of backgrounds that are waking up to what is nowbecoming the obvious. My website alone attracts some million visits a week andthis number is growing all the time. The reason for this is not only that moreand more people have been researching the conspiracy and uncovering an enormouslibrary of evidence, it is also that when the time comes for secret manipulationto install its long-planned agenda, there is a point where it has to break thesurface, where it can be seen. It is one thing to predict the micro-chippedsociety, quite another when micro-chips are being introduced. We are now at thatstage when day after day the changes predicted years ago in my books and thoseof other researchers are becoming reality. As this has progressed, more of thosewho have witnessed the agenda on the “inside” are confirming the plan from theirown experience. One such man is Dr Johannes Koeppl who was an official of theGerman Ministry of Defence and worked at NATO in the late 1970s as an adviser toformer NATO Secretary General, the Bilderberger, Manfred Werner. He met many ofthe Illuminati’s important political players, people like Zbigniew Brzezinski,the founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller, and NationalSecurity Adviser to Jimmy Carter. Koeppl made presentations to meetings of theIlluminati’s Bilderberg Group and to different subsections of the TrilateralCommission. Eventually he had seen enough to realise that the conspiracy was nomere theory. These guys really did intend to take over the world and Brzezinskiwas right at the heart of it. Koeppl said:> “In 1983–4, I warned of a take-over of world governments being orchestrated by> these people. There was an obvious plan to subvert true democracies and> selected leaders were not being chosen based upon character but upon their> loyalty to an economic system run by the elites and dedicated to preserving> their power. All we have now are pseudo-democracies.” 1Bush and Blair are wonderful examples of this. Koeppl said he realised he wasdealing with a “criminal society”. His articles warning of the conspiracy wereeventually blocked by mainstream publications like Newsweek and his career inpolitics going back 30 years was destroyed.2 Like anyone with a brain on activeduty, Koeppl can see what September 11th and the “war on terrorism” are reallyabout. This was more than a war against terrorism, he said, it was a war againstthe citizens of all countries. The “current elites” were creating so much fearthat people didn’t know how to respond. But they must remember, he said, “Thisis a move to implement a world dictatorship within the next five years. Theremay not be another chance.” 3Different masks, same faceDivide and rule is obviously the basis of any attempt by the few to control themany and in the Illuminati strategy this happens at all levels. They operatethrough all races while playing those races off against each other. They operatethrough all religions and do the same. The technique is identical wherever youlook – keep them divided so they can be ruled. This extends even to those peopleand groups who are, in their different ways, challenging parts of the Illuminatiagenda. I mean those who campaign against globalisation; additives in food;genetically modified food; lethal chemicals sprayed on crops; fluoride in thewater; radiation from nuclear facilities; the dangers of vaccinations; theglobal drug-running network; the banking scam; “third world” debt and poverty;the destruction of rainforests; the explosion in surveillance and thedismantling of civil liberties; and a whole long list of other campaigns bypressure groups and “pressure people”. What 95% of them don’t realise, however,is that they are all challenging the same force. These apparently unconnectedexpressions of injustice and abuse are different strands in the same strategy –Illuminati control of the planet and its population (Figure 28).image [../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 28: Pyramids of Manipulation The human being in fully awakened consciousness is genius incarnate. That maysound funny when you look at the world today, but then you are not looking atfully awakened consciousness. You are often observing consciousness operating ata capacity only slightly beyond the point where it can remember to breathe. Butthat is not what we are, it is what we have allowed ourselves to become.Awakened, vibrant consciousness expressing itself through the physical body is anightmare to control and deceive, and the Illuminati know that. For this reasonthe human being is subjected to a second-by-second bombardment of conditioning,disconnection and “dumbing down” through an “education” system designed only toindoctrinate; a media that is there to do the same and put consciousness tosleep with an endless diet of soaps, game shows, and the official story;chemicals added to food (like Rumsfeld’s aspartame); chemicals in the water likefluoride; chemicals that fall from the sky with the chemtrails dispersed bymilitary aircraft all over the world, causing health effects on the population,as now widely documented;4 vaccinations that scramble the body’s naturalchemistry and assault the immune system;5 radiation released in the atmosphere;electromagnetic pollution and extremely low frequency (ELF) waves, and goodnessknows what is hitting us from space these days.I mentioned the mental effects of aspartame earlier and fluoride is anotherexample of the assault on humanity’s ability to think straight. Fluoride is amajor intellect suppressant that is being added to water supplies andtoothpaste. Sodium fluoride is a common ingredient in rat and cockroach poisons,anaesthetics, psychiatric drugs and military nerve gas. It is one of the basicingredients in the mind drug Prozac and the Sarin nerve gas used in the attackon the Japanese subway system. Independent scientific evidence says thatfluoride causes various mental disturbances and makes people stupid, docile, andsubservient. This is besides shortening life span and damaging bone structure.The first use of fluoridated drinking water was in the Nazi prison camps inGermany thanks to the Illuminati’s pharmaceutical giant I.G. Farben. This wasthe company that ran camps like Auschwitz and it still exists as its constituentparts like Bayer. Did the Nazis do this because they were concerned about theteeth of the inmates? This mass medication of water supplies with sodiumfluoride was to sterilise the prisoners and force them into quiet submission.Charles Perkins, a chemist, wrote the following to the Lee Foundation forNutritional Research, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on October 2nd 1954:> “… in the 1930s, Hitler and the German Nazis envisioned a world to be> dominated and controlled by a Nazi philosophy of pan-Germanism. The German> chemists worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass control,> which was submitted to, and adopted by, the German General Staff. This plan> was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of> drinking water supplies. By this method they could control the population in> whole areas, reduce population by water medication that would induce sterility> in women and so on. In this scheme of mass control sodium fluoride occupied a> prominent place.” 6That’s worth thinking about when you use fluoride toothpaste that is not evenbeneficial to your teeth (see Children Of The Matrix and the medical archives atdavidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com]). If you think you are safe becausefluoride is not added to your local drinking water, what about that beer you’redrinking or that can of soda? Where did that water come from? Just imagine theeffects of a daily intake of mind suppressants for someone eating and drinkingaspartame foods, drinking fluoride water, and cleaning their teeth with fluoridetoothpaste. The cumulative affect of all this could make people so stupid theywould vote for George Bush or Tony Blair. Or even vote at all. Or believe theofficial story of 9/11. That explains it then. Genetically modified food isdesigned to genetically modify the body, rewrite the DNA. So are vaccines, cropchemicals and food additives. The DNA rewrite is aimed at reducing the abilityof consciousness to manifest its genius through the brain and I’ll go into moreabout this later. GM food is being promoted by Monsanto, an Illuminaticorporation notorious among researchers and campaigners, and the company thatbought Rumsfeld’s Searle Pharmaceuticals, the producers of aspartame. The Bushadministration is awash with Monsanto placemen and women.The onslaught on body and mind is orchestrated by the same people who manipulatethe financial system and entice the population into ever greater debt. Thefinancial system is legalised theft, which lends people money that doesn’t existand charges them interest on it. It is designed to make us dependent and ensurethat we serve and obey the system if we are to survive, let alone prosper. Thegoal is the control of choice, control of the body, control of the mind, controlof the emotions, control of perception. It is important for those who challengethese apparently diverse problems and injustices to realise that they are allmanipulated by the same group to the same end: mass control. This, and the cabalbehind it all, is the thread that connects globalisation, additives in food,genetically modified food, lethal chemicals sprayed on crops, fluoride in thewater, radiation from nuclear facilities, the dangers of vaccinations, theglobal drug running network, the banking scam, “third world” debt and poverty,the destruction of rain forests, the explosion in surveillance, the dismantlingof civil liberties, and all the rest.No need for prophetsExposing the agenda is no longer about predicting what will be. It is here withus now. In my first book on these subjects in the early 1990s I wrote about thecoming of the human micro-chip and how the plan was for everyone to be chippedand connected to a global computer. The chipping of domestic animals, I wrote,was merely the forerunner to the human chip and this was preparing the publicmind to accept micro-chipping as part of everyday society. Most dismissed thisas nonsense and the ravings of a nutcase. Now all over the world people arebeing micro-chipped in “trials” for a micro-chipped population. In Children OfThe Matrix, I featured a chip-making company called Applied Digital SolutionsInc., and the chip technology it planned to introduce across American societyand around the world. Months after the book was published, the company announcedhuman trials for its “VeriChip”. It said it would soon have a prototype of a“much more complex device, one that is able to receive signals from GlobalPositioning System satellites and transmit a person’s location”.7 The chips makepeople “scannable just like a jar of peanut butter at the supermarket checkoutline”.8 Well, given this is all we are to the Illuminati, I guess that’sappropriate. A signal from the chip transmits a verification number to a scannerand this number is cross-referenced in a central computer with all the person’spersonal details. If you read And The Truth Shall Set You Free, the firstedition of which was written in 1994, you’ll find all of this predicted. Atfirst Applied Digital appeared to withdraw the technology in the face ofopposition, but after September 11th it began promoting the chip with renewedvigour and the “trials” began. Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of theElectronic Privacy Information Center, said: “Parents will decide that theirkids should be implanted, or maybe their own aging parents.” 9 The idea is thatgovernment agencies will eventually decide who gets chipped and they plan todecide, in the interests of “national security”, that everyone will. Thisincludes babies at birth.The “trials” of the VeriChip were given massive publicity in the American media,just as similar “trials” had been in the UK. Jeffrey and Leslie Jacobs and theirteenage son, Derek, from Boca Raton (that place again) in Florida, were giventheir chips on national television. They had accepted the whole manufacturedexcuse for the micro-chip and became unknowing pawns and promoters of an agendadesigned to imprison the human population. Leslie Jacobs hoped it would make herfeel more secure in an insecure world. The Illuminati hope that others feel thesame way because that’s the idea. The signs are certainly good. Applied Digitalsaid soon after the launch publicity that it had a waiting list of 4,000 to5,000 people for the VeriChip and planned to operate a “chipmobile” that willvisit Florida’s senior citizen’s centres.10 The company is charging $200 for thechips and a $10 monthly fee to store the information, but you watch the pricecome down to something like zero when the mass chipping is designed to start. Ilove the idea of the “chipmobile”. Good thinking. They could have them touringthe neighbourhoods playing catchy little tunes like ice cream vans. “Hey dad,can I have a micro-chip, oh pleeease, dad, my friends are all having one.” Ifyou want to be a good parent, if you really love your children, you will securetheir safety by connecting them to a global positioning satellite. Go on, youknow it makes sense.All the things they now say about parents who question the appalling effects ofvaccines on their children will be used with the imposition of the micro-chip.Schools run by idiots in the United States are refusing to allow children toattend if they are not vaccinated and parents are being told they will go tojail if they don’t let their kids be injected with vaccines that wage war ontheir bodies and immune systems. Yep, it’s the Land of Free for sure. Whatgreater definition of dictatorship can you have than losing the right to decidewhat is injected into your own body and those of your children? The chip is justthe next step. The opening emphasis in the VeriChip campaign was the “medicalbenefits” of having your health records and medicine details implanted on thechip – just as I predicted it would be years ago on the basis of informationfrom people who had been involved in meetings planning the chip. The campaignwas also especially targeting an estimated four million people in the UnitedStates who have Alzheimer’s disease and the idea was being sold as a caring,helpful way of ensuring they don’t get lost. Illuminati agendas always targetthe most vulnerable groups first to get people familiar with something, and thenthe plan is expanded to the rest of society. In the same way, such technology isintroduced as a “voluntary” free choice to start with and then made compulsoryonce it is established. Alzheimer’s patients are one of the fastest-growinggroups in the United States. Why? The Illuminati agenda is to introduce astep-by-step plan, which will mean that people will not be able to have schoolmeals, buy food, receive state benefits, board a plane, drive a car, etc., etc.,unless they are micro-chipped and/or subjected to eye scans, face scans,thumbprint scans, and all the other Big Brother technology now in circulation.In May 2002, the Bush government (the private “US” corporation) introducedlegislation that mandates drivers’ licences issued by the states to carry acomputer chip and include a “unique identifier” like a fingerprint. The Driver’sLicense Modernization Act, sponsored by Virginia Representatives Jim Moran(Democrat) and Tom Davis (Republican), also directs that the chip must becapable of accepting software for other applications, including those of privatecompanies. They claim the objective is to stop identity fraud and support“national security”. You know, I think there could just be another reasonmyself. The bill would release $315 million in “federal funds” (money from theAmerican people) to help to pay for the new licences and link up state computersystems, which is exactly what the agenda demands. There’s now also a toothimplant that has been developed to put micro-chip technology in our teeth.What they don’t tell youThat’s some of the bullshit behind the micro-chip campaign, but what’s thetruth? As I have been saying all these years, the technology the public areallowed to see is light years behind that which exists in the shadows, thesecret research projects funded by the Illuminati profits from the global drugtrade, banking scams and all the rest. I was invited in 1997 to meet a scientistwho was working against his will for the CIA. He had joined the agency believinghe was serving his country, but he soon realised they did not want his genius toserve or help anyone or anything. They wanted his knowledge to advance theIlluminati agenda for the Big Brother state that he soon understood was veryreal indeed. When I asked him why he continued to work for the CIA when he wasso sickened by how his work was being used, he told me the story of whathappened when he began to rebel and refuse to cooperate. He left his home oneday and remembers nothing until he woke up in a room. As he recovered hisfaculties he realised there was something attached to his chest. He opened hisshirt as he told me the story and I saw a sort of see-through shampoo-likesachet with an orangey-golden liquid inside. These are called “patches” in theCIA. He said that his body had been manipulated to need the drug in the sachetto survive and the “patch” had to be replaced every 72 hours. If he did not dowhat the CIA demanded, he was told, the patch would not be replaced and he wouldstart to die an agonising death. Later when he rebelled again he learned howtrue this was as they allowed his health to deteriorate painfully until heagreed to do what they wanted. The scientist said he was withholding knowledgethat he had from his CIA bosses because he knew that once they thought ascientist had contributed all he could to their plans the patches are notreplaced and they are allowed to die to ensure that their secrets die with them.He told me that large numbers of people in the secret projects are “patched” inthis way.The scientist said that the technology to cure cancer, provide pollution-freeand cost-free energy, and create abundant growth in deserts without water (bystimulating the energy field of the plants), had been known for a long time. Itwas kept secret because the Illuminati did not want the people to have thefreedom, choice, benefits and abundance this would provide. Instead they usedthe technology in a different way, to enhance their control. But he stressedmore than anything the Illuminati agenda for micro-chipping the population. Hesaid to me in 1997 that the micro-chips already developed and waiting to beintroduced were so small they could be inserted by hypodermic needle duringvaccination programmes. The question is therefore legitimately asked about howmany people are already micro-chipped without their knowledge. Look how easy itwould be. The only thing you would need to do is ensure that the chips were inthe vaccine dose. Once that was done the doctors and nurses all over the worldwould insert the chips without any idea that were doing so. What is happeningnow with the VeriChip and suchlike is just the beginning. The VeriChips are noteven nearly the state-of-the-art. The scientist told me that “electronictagging” and keeping people constantly monitored from satellite (one of the realreasons for the “Star Wars” space technology) was only a part of the micro-chipagenda and not even the most important. He said it was not the signals goingfrom the chip to the computer and satellite that was foremost in the agenda, butthe signals going the other way. He said that once people were micro-chipped thecomputer-satellite system could program the chips, either individually or enmasse, to make people docile or aggressive, sexually stimulated or sexuallysuppressed, kill them from a distance, give them diseases, scramble their mindsand emotions, anything at all. That’s the real agenda of the micro-chip. Iremember years ago when I had satellite television I called the provider’soffice at the opposite end of the United Kingdom to ask to take another channel.I thought they would send me another programmed card for my receiver equipment,but no. The guy asked me to watch my screen and tell him what was happening, andthe new channel came up before my eyes. I asked him the obvious question: “Howdid you do that?” He said he had just sent a signal to the card in the machinein front of me and reprogrammed it to accept the new channel. That’s the planfor micro-chipped people. It is the ultimate goal of the Illuminati because thenthey can create a situation in which every child born is micro-chipped and undertheir control mentally, emotionally and physically from the day they arrive inthis “world”.If you want to see the kind of technology available over the counter tomanipulate mind and body just search around the Internet. I came across a devicecalled Sonic Nausea, a small electronic device which can, says the websiteblurb, “really turn one’s stomach”.11 It “generates a unique combination ofultra-high frequency sound waves which soon leads most in its vicinity toqueasiness”. It can also cause headaches, intense irritation, sweating,imbalance, nausea or even vomiting, says the website. Hiding the device in yourneighbour’s house might put an end to their late-night parties or it could beused in a bureaucrat’s office, the executive lunchroom … “the possibilities areendless for that small portion of inventive payback”. The bigger version, theSuper Sonic Nausea, “provides serious, substantial capability to disrupt anddisperse gatherings … Speeches, demonstrations, crowd dynamics – this device hasbeen used to ‘influence’ more of these in recent years than you might suspect.”Also, according to the promotional blurb, “if planted near the podium, you mightjust have a case of a speaker with diminished clarity and concentration, orperhaps is even unable to complete his presentation ‘due to illness’”. This“illness”, says the blurb, “might even be contagious, as some of the VIPs upthere with him also seemed to have caught the same bug”. Imagine what they coulddo through a micro-chip in your body connected to a computer system.Freedom to exploitWherever you look, the centralisation of power is moving on at tremendous speedin all areas of society and, of course, the more you centralise power the morepower you have to centralise even quicker. Political power is moving further andfurther from the people. First national governments took over the centralcontrol of previously diverse, self-governing regions and peoples, and nowmassive superstates controlled by bureaucrats are dictating to nationalgovernments. We are only one step from the structure that has been theIlluminati goal for so long – world government, army, bank, and currency (Figure29). We have the European Union that passes laws and issues bureaucraticdictates that override and supersede anything decided by national parliaments.This was manipulated into being step by step from the European “free trade area”that the people were “sold” after the Second World War. (See And The Truth ShallSet You Free for how this was done and by whom.) The European Union has a singlecurrency, the euro, which is a stepping-stone to the world currency, and aEuropean Central Bank in Frankfurt dictates financial policy to the subservientnation-states. While I was writing this book, the President of the EuropeanCommission, the Bilderberger, Romano Prodi, was demanding a centralised EUpolicy on foreign affairs, defence and law, and the power to dictate to“nations” their tax and spending policies. He also called for a European tax tofund these increased powers. Using classic newspeak and reverse meaning, he saidthat the EU can be turned into a “grand political project” (turned into?) andpave the way for a “supranational democracy” (centralised dictatorship).12 Ipredicted all of this in my previous books because the agenda is so transparent.The same is planned in the Americas, Africa and Asia-Australia. In And The TruthShall Set You Free, I wrote that the NAFTA “free trade area” in the UnitedStates, Canada and Mexico would be extended to the whole of the Americas andthen turned into a mirror of the European Union. Soon after George W. Bush cameto power he attended the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, at which thiswas agreed. The Canadian dollar is being artificially suppressed to encourageCanadians to replace it with the US dollar, the preferred stepping-stonecurrency for the Americas. The pressure has also begun since September 11th toimpose a “common security zone” and the Massachusetts “Democrat” Ted Kennedy andKansas “Republican”, Sam Brown, have proposed the Enhanced Border Security Act.This seeks to “harmonise” US and Canadian immigration and Bush has called forthe same. “The secretary of state, in coordination with the secretary of thetreasury and the attorney general, shall promptly initiate negotiations withCanada and Mexico to assure maximum possible compatibility of immigration,customs, and visa policies,” Bush said.13 This is exactly what happened inEurope, as nations were drip, dripped into a centralised superstate. Africa nowhas an African Union and in Asia-Australia the Trojan horse “free trade” zone iscalled Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Control) or APEC. Nation states arebecoming administrative units for these centralised bureaucracies and we haveseen nothing yet.image [../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 29: The Illuminati world government structure that is planned to controlthe global fascist state In every facet of society the centralisation of power can be seen, as giantcorporations merge with giant corporations throughout business, banking andmedia ownership. What has been the case secretly for so long is now on publicdisplay as the Big Brother society becomes manifest. We have the orgasmicsituation for the Illuminati in which “free trade” (free for them) and thedropping of “trade barriers” (protecting your own people from exploitation)means that the Illuminati transnationals can make their products for next tonothing by abusing people in the poorest countries, often ruled by viciousdictatorships, and paying them a pittance for working horrendous hours. Thenthese companies ship their products to the rich countries and sell them at anenormous profit. The people in the poor countries lose because of their criminalexploitation and the people in the rich countries lose because they areexploited in another way, and these imports destroy companies and jobs at home.The only people who win are the Illuminati and their transnational network, butthen that’s the idea. The Illuminati, incidentally, want to destroy smallbusiness because it represents the diversity they despise so much and this iswhy business law is rigged in favour of the biggest corporations. The world armythat would enforce the decisions of the world government (currently known as the“war on terrorism”) has been forming before our eyes for decades. The idea is tofuse the powers of NATO and the UN forces into a world army in which foreigntroops would police other countries. This is because troops from one country arefar more likely to carry out orders to strike against a foreign populationrather than their own.Globalised fascismAs I keep stressing, if there are a few who want to impose total control on themany then power has to be centralised. The fewer people making decisionsaffecting the many, the more power the few will have, obviously. We have seenthe excuse of 9/11 constantly exploited to achieve this. One example in Americais the Office of Homeland Security, and in Europe we are seeing ever moreEurope-wide laws and policing. The European Union (EU) introduced a Europeanarrest warrant and people arrested in one country can be handed over to anotherwithout extradition procedures. The EU is setting up “joint investigation teams”(stepping-stone to the long-planned European police force, currently known asEuropol) and it has pledged to “improve cooperation and exchange of information”between the national intelligence agencies within the Union (stepping-stone tothe long-planned European intelligence agency). The EU also wants greatercooperation with agencies in the United States (stepping-stone to thelong-planned world intelligence agency to go with the world government, army,central bank and currency).A Europe-wide definition of a terrorist has also been introduced to underpin theEuropean arrest and extradition warrants. A terrorist group is defined as a“structured organisation … of more than two persons, acting in concert to committerrorist offences”. A better definition of the Bush family I have yet to see.But what constitutes a “terrorist” is so widely defined on both sides of theAtlantic that it could be used – and will be – to imprison, and worse, those whoare simply challenging and exposing the Illuminati agenda and corruption throughcirculating information and peaceful protest. The UK Home Secretary DavidBlunkett plans to introduce ID cards – a stepping-stone to the micro-chip – justas they are in the United States and they will be proposed eventually by theEuropean Union. British governments have been trying to introduce ID cards for along time, but the resistance from civil liberties groups has thwarted them. Nowthat they have 3,000 dead people to use to press their case, we are seeing IDcards proposed with renewed vigour along with the outrageous invasions of phoneand e-mail privacy I mentioned earlier. We are also having eye-readingtechnology introduced at airports and it is all designed to ensure that theglobal population is followed and tracked wherever they go 24 hours a day. JohnWadham, director of the civil rights organisation, Liberty, was correct when hesaid: “As with all governments, other illiberal measures are being smuggled inunder the cover of proposals to deal with the events of 11 September.” 14 Whatkind of mind uses the horrors of September 11th to advance its own agenda? Thevery minds behind 9/11 and the “war on terrorism”.Hitler revisitedPeople say they wonder how the concentration camps of Nazi Germany could havebeen allowed to happen. Why didn’t people see what was going on and do somethingabout it? It is an irony beyond belief to know that while they are asking thesequestions the very same situation is being introduced in their own society. Whathappened in Nazi Germany couldn’t happen again? It is happening. “CivilianHolding Areas” or “Internment Camps”, what we know as concentration camps, arein place across the United States, for instance. Congressman Henry Gonzales ofTexas confirmed years ago what researchers and local people had been claimingfor so long: these camps do exist. He said: “… the truth is yes – you do havethese stand-by provisions, and the plans are here … whereby you could, in thename of stopping terrorism … evoke the military and arrest Americans and putthem in detention camps.” 15 According to one report, the US Army’s Director ofResource Management confirmed the legitimacy of a memorandum which came to lightthat talked of the military’s inmate labour programme for civilians. The memosays: “Enclosed for your review and comment is the draft Army regulation oncivilian inmate labor utilization” and the procedure to “establish civilianprison camps on installations”.16 If you search the Internet you can see manyarticles and pictures of these camps, with lists and maps of their locationsaccording to researchers and local people. You will also see the ten regions ofthe United States planned to be introduced after the final takeover.17 Theconcentration camps are for the “dissidents” and those who seek to expose orresist the Illuminati global fascist state. The people arrested without chargeor public knowledge and jailed indefinitely since 9/11 are part of the policy ofpreparing the public to accept such things as a necessary step to win the “waron terrorism”. In the same way that countries are demonised when the Illuminatiwant to bomb their population, so people within the countries of the “West” aredemonised if they challenge that policy, expose the conspiracy and highlight itsinhuman insanity. This is what happened to those Germans who challenged Hitlerand the Nazis, and to Russians who would not bow to the Stalin dictatorship. Thevery same is being planned across the “West” today because this is due to happenon a large scale once the “war on terrorism” has been escalated still further.The Iran-Contra investigation revealed that there were plans to round updissidents and immigrants during a possible US invasion of Nicaragua and to holdthem in emergency prisons at US military bases and other locations. This was allclaimed to be lawful because of secret Executive Orders and National SecurityDecision Directives introduced in the name of “national security”. Thistechnique is being used to intern American civilians in their own country.The proposed Model State Emergency Health Powers Act gives “public healthofficials” the right to close roads and airports, herd people into stadiums, andquarantine entire cities in the event of a “bio warfare attack” or contagiousdisease. Such attacks are planned by the Illuminati. The proposed law originatesfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and was draftedby lawyers and public health professors at Georgetown University in Washingtonand Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. It would give states immense power tocontrol their populations. James Lee Witt, the former head of the Illuminati’sFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said that orders from the Centersfor Disease Control and a state’s Governor would be implemented by militaryunits of the National Guard. The bill’s leading author, Lawrence Gostin, saidthat Congress “should give public health authorities strong powers to be able toisolate or quarantine people if necessary for the public health,” 18 Asked ifthis would include a National Guardsman shooting a grandmother trying to evadesuch quarantine, he said: “You have to use all reasonable force. Sometimes thatcould mean lethal force.” 19 All the authorities need to invoke the powerscovered by the bill is a “bio attack” or contagious disease and that’s noproblem for them. Civilian internment camps have been law at least since thelate 1940s when J. Edgar Hoover, the notorious head of the FBI and a seriouslydisturbed being, developed a plan codenamed “Security Portfolio”. This allowedthe FBI to put up to 20,000 Americans in security detention camps at a time of“emergency” and these people would not have the right to a court hearing –exactly what has been happening since September 11th.20 Although these laws wereremoved in 1971, a new phase was about to start. In December 1975, Senatehearings produced “Intelligence Activities, Senate Resolution 21”, whichrevealed through documents, memos and government informants, that the governmenthad plans to intern a vast number of American people using so-called MasterSearch Warrants and Master Arrest Warrants. The latter give the FBI permissionfrom the Attorney General to:> “Arrest persons whom I deem dangerous to the public peace and safety. These> persons are to be detained and confined until further order. [The FBI also has> permission to] “… search certain premises where it is believed that there may> be found contraband, prohibited articles, or other materials in violation of> the Proclamation of the President of the United States.” 21These laws give the Attorney General, currently John Ashcroft, the right todecide who can be interned indefinitely and what constitutes, for instance,“prohibited articles”. The President only needs to impose the state of emergencyto activate these powers and plans, and Nazi Germany will be visited on America.We are already seeing this happen and similar plans will be in place in Europe,too. On August 2nd 1990, just ahead of the Gulf War, President Father GeorgeBush signed two executive orders, 12722 and 12723, that involved martial law inthe United States and suspending the Constitution. Professor Diana Reynolds ofthe Fletcher School of Diplomacy at Boston’s Tufts University said that whenBush announced a national emergency he “activated one part of a contingencynational security emergency plan”.22 This plan involves a series of laws passedsince the presidency of Richard Nixon, which Professor Reynolds says give thepresident boundless powers. She says that the Defense Industrial Revitalizationand Disaster Relief Acts of 1983 “would permit the president to do anything fromseizing the means of production, to conscripting a labor force, to relocatinggroups of citizens”, and the cumulative effect of these laws is to suspend theConstitution whenever the President decides to invoke them. She says that they“permit the stationing of the military in cities and towns, closing off the USborders, freezing all imports and exports, allocating all resources on anational security priority, monitoring and censoring the press, and warrantlesssearches and seizures”.23Heeere’s FEMA – againThe paramount agency at the heart of all this is the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA) of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Oliver North. ProfessorReynolds said that the stimulus for the centralisation of vast powers in FEMAcame from the actions of Father George Bush in 1976 when he was director of theCIA. She said that Bush assembled a group called Team B, which released a reportclaiming that the CIA had underestimated the dangers of a Soviet nuclear attack.The report advised the development of elaborate plans for “civil defence” and apost-nuclear government, and three years later FEMA was given overallresponsibility for these plans. Bush signed Executive Order 12681 on July 6th1989, which gave FEMA, a supposedly “emergency response” agency, the right tospy on Americans. Bush declared as law without Congressional debate that FEMA’sNational Preparedness Directorate would “have as a primary functionintelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work”.24Note the term “primary function”. When a “national emergency” or “martial law”is invoked by the President, FEMA already has the power to make people workwherever it dictates; have every person registered; commandeer their homes andmake them live where FEMA demands; take control of food and power supplies;radio and television stations and frequencies; health care, education, and alltransportation including aircraft and airports. The military takeover ofairports since September 11th is just the first step in the control by the USmilitary of its own people. Louis Guiffreda, a cousin to the Bush family, I amtold, was head of FEMA and became Deputy Attorney General of California. (SeeChildren Of The Matrix for a strange story about Guiffreda.)25 He was a closeassociate of the then Governor of California Ronald Reagan, who, as USPresident, appointed him head of FEMA. Guiffreda was the man who said thatanyone who attacks the state, even with words, becomes, by definition, arevolutionary and enemy. While he was head of FEMA he said “legitimate violenceis integral to our form of government, for it is from this source that we cancontinue to purge our weaknesses”.26 For “weakness” read those who know what isgoing on. Guiffreda has also written that “Martial Rule comes into existenceupon a ‘determination’ [note not a public declaration] by the senior militarycommander that the civil government must be replaced because it is no longerfunctioning anyway.” He adds: “Martial Rule is limited only by the principle ofnecessary force.” 27 According to Professor Diana Reynolds, it is possible forthe President to make declarations concerning a national emergency secretlythrough a National Security Decision Directive. Most such directives areclassified as so secret that “researchers don’t even know how many areenacted”.28Ben Bradlee Jr writes that FEMA’s 1984 REX 84-ALPHA exercises involving OliverNorth were designed to test its ability to take authority from the Department ofDefense, the National Guard in every state, and “a number of state defenseforces to be established by state legislatures”.29 REX 84 was similar to a plansecretly adopted by Reagan when he was governor of California together withEdwin Meese, who later became US Attorney General, and … Louis Guiffreda, theFEMA director in 1984 when the North “exercises” were happening.30 Part of theplan when FEMA assumes command in an “emergency” is that the military would thenbe “deputised” by FEMA to overcome the law forbidding military involvement indomestic law enforcement. The 1878 law of Possee Comitatus forbids the federalUS military to be involved in law enforcement on American soil that involvesarrests, searches, seizure of evidence and other activities performed by thepolice and civilian law enforcement. However, moves are being made to changethis so the military state can roll on. Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy DefenseSecretary, agreed during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee inOctober 2001 that it might be desirable to give federal troops more of a role indomestic policing to prevent terrorism. “In certain cases we can do more thananyone else in the country because of the special capabilities that we have,” hesaid. What did Clinton call for after Oklahoma? An easing of restrictions on themilitary’s involvement in domestic law enforcement.The Washington Post reported soon after 9/11 that top military authoritieswanted to appoint a four-star commander to “coordinate federal troops used inhomeland defense, part of a broad reorganization that Pentagon officials saycould change some forces’ primary mission from waging war overseas to patrollingat home”.31 The Post said that the attacks of September 11th and the “war onterrorism” have “… blurred the distinction between foreign wars and domesticcrimes and prompted a rethinking of the Pentagon’s command structure and forceassignments”. Problem-reaction,-solution. Boy George announced in April 2002 theformation of Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, headed by a four-star general, whichwill “coordinate” with the Office of Homeland “Defense”. The first head ofNORTHCOM was widely predicted in the media to be Ralph Eberhart, the head ofNORAD and Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain, which failed to react in time whenfour airliners were hijacked in North American airspace. NORTHCOM willcoordinate “homeland defence” for North America and for the first time Mexicocomes under a Pentagon command. Bush also called in June 2002 for a new cabinetdepartment to take control of “homeland defence” and make sure the failings ofintelligence before 9/11 did not happen again (problem-reaction-solution). Atthe same time, Britain announced plans to create a 6,000-strong military“rapid-reaction force” to react to “possible terror attacks”. Bush clone RobertMueller, who became head of the FBI just two weeks before 9/11 and has since“led” the “investigation”, also announced to the media on May 15th, 2002, a planfor an FBI “supersquad” that would lead all major “terrorism investigations”worldwide.32 This would involve hiring hundreds of agents and analysts, and thecreation of an Office of Intelligence, headed by a former CIA official. Wellthat fills me with confidence. This is an example of what I said about thepublicly exposed incompetence of an organisation, in this case the FBI, beingused to increase its power through problem-reaction-solution. The FBI “supersquad” is another organisation with centralised power designed to cover up thepeople behind the orchestrated terrorism that is planned in the future. We don’twant those naughty genuine agents actually investigating these atrocities, sowe’ll create our own operation and fill it with our guys. Job done. FBI specialagent Coleen Rowley said in her letter of complaint to Mueller in May 2002:> “Your plans for an FBI Headquarters’ ‘Super Squad’ simply fly in the face of> an honest appraisal of the FBI’s pre-September 11th failures. The Phoenix,> Minneapolis and Paris Legal Attache Offices reacted remarkably exhibiting keen> perception and prioritization skills regarding the terrorist threats they> uncovered or were made aware of pre-September 11th. The same cannot be said> for the FBI Headquarters’ bureaucracy and you want to expand that?!”The logic or otherwise of an action depends on where you are standing and whatyou wish to achieve. From Coleen Rowley’s point of observation, Mueller’sproposal is crazy, but from the Illuminati’s point of view it makes perfectsense in their desire for control. The Illuminati agenda is not hiding any more,such is the magnitude of the advances made as a result of September 11th. It isunfolding all around us and yet, as in Nazi Germany, if it doesn’t directlyaffect people immediately they don’t want to know and don’t want to speak outfor those who are being targeted. The Reverend Martin Niemöller, a pastor in theGerman Confessing Church, spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp andwhat he said about the progression to tyranny should hang on the wall in everyhome:> “First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out because I was not> a communist. Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out> because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the labour leaders, and I> did not speak out because I was not a labor leader. Then they came for the> Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me,> and there was no one left to speak out for me.”Human race, please note.FEMA and Hurricane AndrewI have spoken with survivors of Hurricane Andrew, which struck South DadeCounty, Florida, in 1992 and anyone who wants to know what the world will belike under organisations like FEMA and their masters should listen to what theysay. The horror stories they tell about the actions of FEMA beggar belief. Farfrom helping the hundreds of thousands of homeless and injured victims, FEMAcordoned off the area and left the people to fend for themselves. They weregiven no food, no water, no medical supplies, no shelter and no help whatsoeverwhen the disaster struck. One of the victims was K.T. Frankovich who sufferedserious injuries in the hurricane. She tells of her horrific experiences in herbook, Where Heavens Meet33 About three days after the hurricane had devastatedthe region, she said a long line of police cars, about 12 to 15, arrived in herarea. Each car was driven by a man dressed in a dark police uniform and they hadthree other plain-clothes men riding as passengers, she said. K.T. had a brokenjaw, eight teeth knocked out and huge pieces of glass were embedded in her bodythat only a scalpel could remove. She begged this FEMA convoy for help and thiswas the exchange that followed, as described by K.T. in Where Heavens Meet:> “‘Please, sir, I need medical help,’ I begged, barely able to speak. The> officer sitting behind the wheel sighed heavily. He turned his head away from> me and gazed out his windshield. The other three men in the car quietly looked> at me. ‘Sir, please, I need to get to a hospital,’ I begged frantically. The> officer took his time about reaching over to turn off the engine. With another> sigh, he slowly opened the door and climbed out. He then proceeded to close> the door and stood there with his legs spread astride.> “‘Lady, do me a favour,’ he answered. ‘Find yourself a piece of paper and a> pencil. Write down your name and social security number next to the telephone> number of your nearest living relative. Tuck the piece of paper in your pocket> so tomorrow, when I find your body, I’ll know who to contact.’> “‘No! No!’ I cried out. ‘You don’t understand. I need to get to a hospital.> I’ve been badly injured.’> “‘No! You’re the one who doesn’t understand,’ he hissed back.> “With that, he reached over to his holster and took out his gun. He grabbed> me, forcing me up against the side of the car, and proceeded to put the barrel> of the gun against my temple. I heard the hammer cock. From the position he> had pushed me into, I could see directly into the car. The man sitting in the> front passenger seat looked away from me immediately, glancing down at the> floor. The two passengers in the back seat turned their heads quickly, staring> out the window on the opposite side of the car. My son and the other survivor> watched as the officer had pulled back the hammer on the gun. So shocked out> of their minds by what they were witnessing, neither one could move!> “’You don’t belong here!’ the officer growled, pressing the barrel into the> side of my head. ‘Now you get the hell outta here before I blow away your> ass!’> “He shoved my face into the car window and then released me. Someone grabbed> me from behind and whirled me around so fast, I didn’t have time to think!> Before I knew it, I was being thrown over a shoulder. My rescuer took off> running as fast as he could! I caught a brief glimpse of my son running next> to me. With one gigantic leap, he and the survivor who carried me dove behind> a pile of debris. All three of us crashed on top of each other in one> tangled-up heap.> “‘I’ll shoot your damn asses!’, the officer’s voice rang out.” 34This is the mentality behind FEMA, the US military, the Office of Homeland“Security” and leaders of government. That mentality would not orchestrate whathappened on September 11th to advance its agenda? The official death toll inHurricane Andrew was 26,35 but K.T. Frankovich says she saw at least 71 bodiestaken away from one small area alone. She estimates the dead to have numberedthousands. But how many people know that? Only those involved and no one islistening to them. As always the media told us what the official sources toldthem and they had no inclination to investigate further because life’s easierthat way. When you consider how 8,230 mobile homes and 9,140 apartmentsdisappeared in the wake of 200–300 miles-an-hour winds, it is obvious that theofficial dead toll of 26 is insane. K.T. Frankovich recalls:> “The National Guard along with the Coast Guard, the Army, FEMA, Metro Dade> Police, state police and local police removed dead bodies and body parts as> quickly as possible during those first ten days of the aftermath. Horrified> survivors watched as both uniformed and civilian-clothed men searched the> rubble and filled body bags, which they then stacked in military vehicles or> huge refrigerator trucks normally used to transport food, only to drive off> and leave the stranded injured to fend for themselves.> “Not until I managed to escape the aftermath did I discover that the> ‘thermo-king’ sections of these same refrigerator trucks, jam-packed with> wall-to-wall body bags, ended up being stored at Card Sound Navy Base, located> in an isolated area just above the Florida Keys. The inside temperature was> kept cool by portable generators until the bodies were either incinerated or> just plain dumped into huge open grave pits.> “Those working on the body pick-up operation were forced to take what is known> as the Oath of Sworn Secrecy, which is strictly enforced by the government.> Many of them plunged into shock, once exposed to the ghastly devastation and> countless mutilated bodies. The horrors were way beyond human comprehension. I> can vouch for this, as I accidentally stepped on the severed hand of a young> child when I initially crawled out of the debris, only to witness shortly> thereafter two dead teenagers and the decapitated body of a baby girl.” 36K.T. says that when she lectured at the Clearwater Convention in Florida in1999, a man in the audience introduced himself as Chief Petty Officer Roy Howardand said he had spent nine weeks on active duty working in South Dade Countyamid the devastation. He said he learned that at least 5,280 people had died andthat the bodies had been “confiscated” by the National Guard and secretlydisposed of in incinerators in a joint operation with FEMA. At least another1,500 bodies were “confiscated” from lakes and other water.37 This is theAmerica that the population doesn’t see, but it soon will if people don’t wakeup fast. FEMA, the organisation behind all this and with all those fascistpowers to takeover America, is a 100% Illuminati creation funded by the profitsfrom the CIA-Bush family drug operation. It is no surprise to learn, then, thatit was during Father George’s time at the CIA and in the White House between1980 and 1992 that this “emergency management” network was established in thename of fighting terrorism and … drug trafficking!38 You have got to admiretheir cheek if nothing else.“We will not tolerate civil disobedience …”The training of troops for the planned military coup on the United States, andthe conditioning of the population to accept it for their own safety, is wellunder way in the form of “urban warfare exercises” known as “Urban Warrior”.These have been happening all over America and often involve foreign troops forthe reasons outlined earlier. They are coordinated by the US Marine CorpsWarfighting Laboratory, based in Quantico, Virginia. One of these “exercises”was at Monterrey Bay on Saturday, March 13th 1999, when hundreds of marineslanded in amphibious landing craft from ships five miles offshore. They swarmedinto the city of Monterrey, patrolling the streets to “practise”counterterrorist operations among American people. It was planned and agreed bylocal and federal authorities, and local people were given no choice. S. BrianWillson, who challenged the decision, wrote:> “It seems that this “Urban Warrior” exercise is part of a national effort,> still virtually under wraps after years of preparation, to utilize the armed> forces to counter the much talked about increased threat of “terrorist”> activities in the United States. It is conceivable that this Urban Warrior> exercise, as a counter-“terrorist” operation, will have as suspects and> adversaries US residents considered unpopular or undesirable based on> convenient political demonizing.” 39That was written in 1999 and the attacks of September 11th have given thosebehind Urban Warrior the perfect excuse to expand what has been happening foryears already. Footage I saw of one these Urban Warrior invasions in Oakland,northern California, included soldiers pointing guns at civilians in their ownstreets and one shouted “attention, attention, attention, American forces arehere to help, keep calm, we will not tolerate civil disobedience”.40 InKingsville, Texas, the black helicopters (which are not supposed to exist) ofthe elite Delta Force suddenly descended on the population for an “exercise” inthe streets of their town. Delta Force was created during the Carteradministration as a counterterrorist unit within the US military. These are theguys preparing to be used in the military coup on America and they were presentat Waco. Delta Force took over San Antonio in Texas for an “exercise” despiteopposition for two years by local law enforcement against them doing so. Marinestook control of the city hall at Swanboro, North Carolina, and set up acheckpoint directly in front of the police station where they posted a sign thatread, “Military Checkpoint Ahead”.41 Deli owner Marty Proctor had Marinesoutside his shop and he concluded: “This is training for urban warfare againstthe American people … they’re just preparing for when people get pissed offenough to start saying ‘enough’s enough.’” He said that a man and woman pulledup outside his deli and were too afraid to get out of their car:> “They had little kids. Of course they don’t want the kids walking up and down> the street with people in camouflage gear carrying M-16 machine guns. We saw a> guy today that was carrying an M-60. One guy was there with an M-60 in the> prone position aiming it down the street.” 42Proctor said that some residents told him the Marines at checkpoints had pointedautomatic weapons at them, though the soldiers claimed they were not loaded.Marines lay behind sandbags pointing machine guns at cars approaching thecheckpoint and there were military vehicles mounted with automatic weapons. OneMarine questioned by reporters from the WorldNet Daily website told them: “Mostpeople see police officers on a day to day basis and think nothing of it.They’re not intimidated, as they should be. When we’re seen, it’s anintimidation thing more than anything.” He was asked if residents should beconcerned about the military acting as a police force and he said: “It’s a newworld. It’s a new world.” 43 That’s for sure. Some of these “exercises”, likeone in Austin, Texas, have not told the population what is happening until it isover because the idea is to observe the reaction of people who believe themilitary have taken over their town.You can trust me children, I have a nice car …These “exercises” have also included using children to find out where the legalgun owners live. The targeting of children and young people, and the general useof the people to spy on each other on behalf of the state is at the heart of thepolicy, as it is in any fascist society. You see many references to high-techsurveillance in children’s television programmes as the conditioning continues.A plan called Capital Area Campus Crime Stoppers in Austin, Texas, offersrewards for those reporting fellow students to the authorities. “The mission ofthe Campus Crime Stoppers program is to assist the AISD Police Department andthe Travis County Sheriff’s Office in the fight against crime on schoolcampuses,” says its website.44 Students are urged to call the number 499-TIPSand if their report leads to an arrest they will qualify for a reward of $200.Each year since it was launched in 1995, says the website, student participationhas increased. Students can also become members and get discounts at HighlandLanes, Showplace Lanes, Westgate Lanes, Dart Bowl, Fiesta Texas, Music Mania,and Chaparral Ice. Hey, and don’t miss the exciting fundraising events ofCapital Area Crime Stoppers, Inc., including Crime Stoppers: Fight Back Austinand the annual jail-a-thon. A few can only control the many if the many controleach other. Children and young people are being especially targeted so that theycome to accept the constant surveillance and control as part of life becausethey have known no different. Schools are becoming fortresses with cameraseverywhere and in the United States fingerprint scanners are being introducedfor children to pay for school lunch. Walter Curfman, Superintendent of theTussey Mountain School District in western Pennsylvania, said: “You always haveyour finger with you, unless you cut it off.” 45 How observant. The scanningsystem was developed in response to a federal regulation requiring thatcafeterias hide who is getting free or reduced-price lunches, Curfman said(problem-reaction-solution). The company behind the scheme now wants to expandthe system for use in recording attendance and on school door locks. Thumbprintsare now also being introduced for rental car hire and even buying food in thelocal store – exactly as predicted in my books in the mid-1990s.46 The reasonthat most people are accepting Big Brother schools is to protect their childrenfrom harm. Fear, the big F, is the Illuminati’s prime vehicle for manipulation.This has been fuelled by students going crazy with guns, as in the mass killingat the Columbine (Columba, Semiramis) School on April 20th 1999. Note the dateagain – April 19th and 20th are the Satanic days dedicated to the god Baal anddemand blood sacrifice. Same as Waco, same as Oklahoma. See also the informationin my books on mind control.Good job it’s only a theory, eh?There remain billions of people today who still say there is no evidence of theconspiracy and it’s just a theory. There are many reasons for this. Among themare a lack of research; not wishing to admit they have been duped all theirlives; and solid, virtually impenetrable denial because they don’t want to facethe situation we are in. Head in the sand, as it is known. Meanwhile themilitary fascist state rolls on with tracking systems for cars and cellphonesconnected to global positioning satellites that can spot them, the authoritiesclaim, down to a few feet. (So why did they not find bin Laden then?) There areproposals to implant electronic devices into “non-violent” offenders to ensurethey don’t go outside a designated area and the devices can be programmed totrigger shocks until the person goes back to where the authorities have told himhe must be. The United Nations continues to take control of enormous tracts ofland in the United States and elsewhere in the name of “protecting theenvironment” when the forces behind the UN are the ones behind the pollution andenvironmental degradation. Now, thanks to September 11th, the explosion oflegislation I detailed earlier has demolished what was left of civil libertiesand basic freedoms. Watch also for the China connection. Insiders, including theCIA scientist with the “patch” on his chest, have told me for many years thatChina is planned to play a major role at some point in this agenda.Back to Iraq? They’ve never been awayAs I complete this book, the Bush and Blair governments are trying to persuadepeople it is a good idea, and perfectly legitimate, to invade and mass bomb Iraqin the “war on terrorism”. This is not for any alleged connection between SaddamHussein, the attack on America and Osama bin Laden, because they do not want tofocus any attention on the members of the Iraqi Republican Guard that weresettled in Oklahoma and elsewhere in the United States by Father George Bushafter the Gulf War. Perhaps it was with this in mind that the CIA said inFebruary 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq has engaged in any terrorismdirected at the United States or its allies. Instead they want to invade Iraqbecause of Saddam’s “threat to the world with his weapons of mass destruction”.National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told New Yorker reporter NicholasLemann that the policy was not just to stop terrorism, but to prevent theaccumulation of weapons of mass destruction in “the hands of irresponsiblestates.”47 What, like the US and Britain? The weapons they said were owned byIraq are those that Scott Ritter, one of the weapons inspectors in Iraq, saiddid not exist. He told Arms Control Today that the threat from Iraq wasbasically zero. He said: “Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities ofchemical or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrialmeans to produce these agents had either been eliminated or were subject tostringent monitoring.” 48 The same was true of Iraq’s nuclear and ballisticmissile capabilities and Ritter said it was possible as early as 1997 todetermine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed. MeanwhilePakistan, a country with deep connections to 9/11, was allowed to possessnuclear weapons with no consequences from the United States once it agreed tojoin the “war on terrorism”. As always, the Illuminati change the rules to fitthe desired goal. If the agenda is threatened by the agreement of the Taliban tohand over bin Laden or Iraq allows new weapons inspections, the very actions youdemand to avoid an invasion, you just say sorry, changed our mind, and think ofanother excuse. Asked if it would make a difference to US invasion plans if Iraqgave in to US demands, Secretary of State Colin Powell told CNN that “even thenthe United States believes the Iraqi people would be better served with a newkind of leadership”.49 Not to mention America. Or, as Bernard Lewis of PrincetonUniversity said in his Middle East briefing of senior White House staff: “… inthat part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute force and will”.50The Iraqi people have lost some one million children to bombing, hunger anddisease caused by sanctions demanded by the United States and Britain since1991. This is a country in which babies are being born with unbelievabledeformities because of the radioactive material contained in the bombs that havedevastated the lives of the people. Cancer rates have soared and Iraq hasdeveloped the world’s highest rate of childhood leukaemia. Some 70% of Iraqiwomen are now anaemic, and two coordinators of the so-called “oil-for-food”programme, which provides the oil cartel with cheap Iraqi oil, have resigned andspoken out against the genocidal affects of the sanctions. Now, as I write, Bushand Blair are trying to overcome opposition around the world, and justify themass bombing of these people and the occupation of their country. Why? I willlet President Bush answer in his own reversed and coded message:> “The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a> cult of evil that seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.> Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by> tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice while daring to claim> the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of> evil; it is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in the> terrorists evil has found a willing servant.”This is why those in power spend trillions of dollars on war and destructionwhen a fraction of that would bring an end to hunger and avoidable diseaseacross the world. It doesn’t have to be like this, it is just a choice. Theworld is the way it is because the forces behind those in political, militaryand media power want it to be this way and the rest of the people allow it to bethis way. While the planet is being taken over more and more every day by theIlluminati military state, the mainstream media creates a diversion for thepublic mind with its game shows, its obsession with sport and celebrity gossip,and “news” programmes that are largely propaganda arms of the official versionof life. The agenda is introduced virtually without challenge while the peoplefocus on the latest football game for Manchester United or the Miami Dolphins,drool over the Oscar ceremony, or speculate on the father of a movie star’s“love child”. Having served the Illuminati by producing the diversion (largely,at the lower levels, through ignorance) the media completes its crucialcontribution by seeking to ridicule or discredit those who do have the foresightand passion to investigate and expose the conspiracy. As Andreas von Bulow, theformer German Defence Minister, said: “Journalists don’t even raise the simplestquestions and those who differ are labelled crazy.” 51 There’s a guy on Britishtelevision called Jon Ronson who produced a book called Them: Adventures WithExtremists52 that purported to offer insight into people like conspiracyresearchers. Note the implication in the title that if you talk about theconspiracy you are an “extremist”. What does that make those who orchestrate themass murder of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq then –“moderates”? I found Ronson depressingly, though predictably, uninformed and Iwas not alone. You have seen how much information is presented in this singlebook, never mind the thousands of pages in my previous publications and the5,000 pages on my website. Yet in an interview promoting his book in 2002,Ronson said of my information: “I think he made it up.” 53 I would like to saythat Ronson is an exception, but sadly he is not. If we are going to bring anend to the Illuminati agenda, and we are, everyone has to take responsibilityfor researching and communicating what is happening. If people expect themainstream media to do it for them, they may as well put their hands in the airnow, get in line for a micro-chip, and prepare for a global version of NaziGermany.But then all this is only a theory, so no worries; and those of us who expose itare just crazy nutters, right?Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctorsdestroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religionsdestroy spirituality”Michael EllnerThroughout most of this book I have been referring to the world as perceived bythe five senses. Therefore, although the information has been very challengingand fundamentally contradicts the conditioned view of life, the overwhelmingmajority of readers will no doubt be persuaded by the vast body ofinterconnected evidence and “coincidences” that, at the very least, there isanother agenda going on that they are never told about. Others will havedismissed the whole idea of a conspiracy from the start, but then the price ofsand is quite cheap at the moment, apparently, and those people will have longput the book down to catch the latest from CNN.At this point, however, I am about to part company with the credulity of anumber of those who have been with me thus far. Nothing like as many as youwould think, given where I am going from here, but a good number for sure.That’s fine and as it should be. I am not trying to persuade or convince anyoneof anything. My only desire is to see that all people have access to allinformation and, that done, they should be free to make up their own minds aboutwhat to make of it. But I would stress that in our five-sense prison we aredenied an infinity of knowledge about the nature of life and to considerpossibility only from the five-sense perspective, especially one constantly andmassively conditioned and programmed by Illuminati propaganda, is an exercise infundamental self-delusion. What we are not being told about 9/11 isinfinitesimal compared with what we are not being told about life itself – whowe are, where we come from, and the nature of reality. For the vast majority ofthe six billion incarnate spirits on this planet the ability to see and feel and“know” beyond the five senses is the land of the cuckoos and fairies. They livein the “real world”. They have no truck with that airy-fairy nonsense. Can I seeit, hear it, touch it, smell it, and taste it? Oh, it exists then. But in facttheir “real world” is the world of the Illuminati illusion.I am me – and shall always beI am guided by information and intuition, and I will go wherever that takes me,no matter what anyone else may think. What people make of my information is noneof my business, but what I make of it is very much my business and no oneelse’s. I will decide how I view reality because I have that infinite divineright and nothing and no one is going to deflect me from that, not by ridicule,condemnation, nor any other means. I make this point because most research intothe global conspiracy is compiled and written from the five-sense perspective.It is about names, dates, places, agendas and connections. That’s fine andnecessary. I do the same myself, as you can see, but that’s only part of thestory, the point where the conspiracy interacts with the physical senses and theworld that we see, hear, touch, smell and taste. The conspiracy, however, ismuch bigger than that; we are much bigger than that. But when I go beyond thefive-sense prison, beyond the conditioned reality, most conspiracy researchersdismiss me because I am “not credible”. What they mean is that I am prepared togo in my search for truth far beyond where their minds are prepared to explore.Often this is because they cannot comprehend of phenomena at work beyond therange of the five senses, but in other cases it is because they fear that ifthey do venture outside the accepted “norms” their “credibility” will bethreatened. They are still allowing the conditioning of others to dictate wherethey will go and what they will say. They are still controlled by the fear ofwhat other people think, still operating in the five-sense prison, and so stillunder the control of the Illuminati agenda, albeit much less so than themajority of the population.Tent pitchingWhen we arrive in this five-sense “world” we begin to walk our journey ofexperience. I have likened it to carrying a tent in a backpack, walking down theroad and looking for somewhere to pitch it, settle down, and find our comfortzone. Where we choose to stop decides the way we see the world because this isthe point, the perspective, from which we observe people and events. Here aresome of the “camp sites”.> •Base Camp: Most people don’t choose to walk very far. A few strides and out> come the pegs at a point where they believe what the media tells them and> accept that they are ordinary and powerless or that they know all they need to> know (same thing). They are happy to drift through life guided by accepted> “norms” and conditioned “thought”. They include the atheists and the fanatical> religious believers, those who think this world is all that exists and those> who think that if they do whatever their religion tells them they might get a> ticket to the afterlife in paradise. I will call these the “Base-Campers” and> they represent by far the greatest number of humankind.> •Radical Camp: Others walk a bit further until they find an acceptable spot.> These are the “Radical-Campers”, and they have begun to see that there is more> to know than we are told. They may be “greens” and “environmentalists” or> campaigners against the arms trade, “third world” debt, globalisation and> other five-sense injustices. The Base-Campers who pitched their tents back> down the road see these Radical-Campers as extreme and “loony” because we> judge everything and everyone from our own point of observation – where our> tent is pitched. What is perfectly sensible to one person or group will be> extreme or crazy to another. In the same way, our conditioning, background and> accumulated “knowledge” lead us to see the same event from very different> perspectives. If a guy came out of the sea with a crab clinging to his bum> someone might shout, “Hey, there’s a crab’s claw stuck to your bum.” But a> fellow crab might say, “Hey, you’ve got a man’s bum stuck to your claw.”> Depends on your point of observation.> •Conspiracy Camp: Those who are still not satisfied with the perspectives and> beliefs of the Radical Camp decide to walk some more before they pitch the> tent. These “Conspiracy-Campers” realise that the injustices the> Radical-Campers acknowledge are not random, but part of a coldly calculated> global injustice, the Illuminati conspiracy. They will see the connections and> the game plan within the five-sense reality – the names, dates, coordination> and so on. The Radical-Campers see these Conspiracy-Campers as extreme in the> same way that Base Campers see them. The Radical-Campers may, and indeed many> do, condemn the Conspiracy-Campers as “racist” and “Nazis”. Did you know that> a global fascist state is unfolding all around you? What? You’re a Nazi –> condemn him, ban his meetings, ban his books. You think I’m joking? If only I> was. Back down the road in the tent city of the Base Camp, they see the> Conspiracy-Campers as crazy, loony “conspiracy theorists” akin to members of> the Flat Earth Society.> •Infinity Camp: There are others, the “Infinity-Campers” I will call them, who> continue to walk on past the point where the five-sense conspiracy researchers> are banging in their pegs. They have no desire to pitch a tent and they don’t> even carry one because there is never enough time to put it down before> something draws them further down the road of inner and outer discovery. By> now the road is quiet with not many people about, but those who venture this> far start to realise that the world we see, hear, touch, smell and taste, is> an illusion and only a very tiny frequency range that those senses can> perceive. Beyond its vibrational walls is infinity, where all possibility> exists. They see that the five-sense “human bodies” of the Illuminati leaders> are only a physical vehicle for entities operating beyond the five senses to> control the “physical” world and turn humanity into a giant battery, an energy> source.

Their points of observation are so different, and this> puts them, literally, on different “wavelengths”.Of course, this is a simplistic outline of what happens and there are manysubgroups and cross-matches, but the theme I have laid out here is very true andcan be observed every day. My friend Guylaine Lanctot, a former Canadian doctorand author of two brilliant books, The Medical Mafia and What The Hell Are WeDoing Here Anyway?,1 refers to the Base-Campers as the white sheep and theRadical and Conspiracy-Campers as the black sheep. The white sheep are themasses that blindly accept the official version of reality while the black sheeprebel against that to a larger or lesser extent. But they are all still sheep,still caught in the five-sense “fly trap”. What they think they see is what theythink they get. I can understand, given this situation, why many people willfind this last chapter challenging to their sense of reality, but so be it. It’sjust a choice and we should not be looking at differing perspectives as right orwrong. I would say “different” is a far more appropriate description. Anyway, ifyou are new to this information, I should strap in.“World” of illusionWe don’t live in a “world” at all. We live in a frequency range, the one thatour five senses can access and perceive, and the five-sense range of perceptionis tiny. Infinite creation is not structured like a tower block. “Heaven” is notin the sky. The sky is in the sky. Infinity consists of infinite frequenciessharing the same space in the same way as all the radio and televisionfrequencies broadcasting to your area now are sharing the same space that yourbody is occupying. Those broadcast frequencies are not just around your body,they are sharing the same space. They can do this because they are operating ona different frequency range or wavelength to your body and to each other. Onlywhen the frequencies are really close do we get “interference”, otherwise allare oblivious to each other’s existence because they literally operate indifferent frequencies, different “realities” or “worlds”. When you tune yourradio to a station, say Radio 1, that is what you get. You don’t hear Radio 2,3, or 4 because they are not broadcasting on the wavelength to which your radiois tuned. Move the dial from the frequency of Radio 1 to Radio 2 and now,obviously, you hear Radio 2. But Radio 1 did not cease to broadcast when youmoved the dial from its wavelength. It goes on broadcasting – existing – whileyour focus, your consciousness, is tuned to something else. This is preciselythe principle on which infinite creation operates. When people say that infinityis within you or, symbolically, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, that iscorrect. All infinity is within us because all of infinity shares all space. Thepoint is, however, that we cannot see all of infinity with our five senses, justas you cannot hear all the radio stations available by tuning to one of them. Wesee only that tiny part of infinity that is vibrating to the frequency of thosesenses – what we see, hear, touch, smell and taste. This is what I call thefive-sense prison because most people are so trapped in its manufactured andmanipulated illusions that they believe that this is all that exists. It istheir only reality. This is further ingrained and conditioned by the “education”system, the media and “science”, all of which are dominated by the belief thatthe “world” of the five senses is all that there is. Why is this? Because that’swhat the Illuminati want us to believe for reasons I will explain shortly.Vibrations in the mind of “God”Everything is vibrating energy. When energy is vibrating slowly it appears to usto be “dense” and “solid”, but look at it under a microscope and no matter how“solid” something seems to be it is still vibrating energy. If it were notvibrating it could not exist. As the speed of vibration increases the energybecomes less and less dense, just as ice becomes water becomes steam, becomes“invisible”. Heat raises the speed of vibration, as with this ice-water-steamexample. When something gets hotter its vibration increases and it becomes less“solid”. Apply enough heat to a “solid” substance like metal and it meltsbecause its vibrational state has dramatically changed. In the same way, when avibration increases so does the temperature. As I have been writing in my bookssince 1991, the vibration of this planet is getting faster and look at what hashappened to the temperature. We have the phenomenon of “global warming”, whichhas been wrongly blamed on industrial pollution. I am not, I stress, saying thatpollution is a good thing, only that it is not the cause of the risingtemperature. That is down to the quickening frequency or vibration of theplanetary energy field, and it has hardly started yet.Another dimensionIf you change the vibration of something its physical expression will change. Anopera singer can break a wine glass merely from the sound of her voice becauseof the vibrational connection between the sound vibration of the voice and thevibrational field of the glass. For a split second the voice vibration becomesthe same frequency as the glass, it tunes into it, you might say, and dismantlesits vibrational stability. So it smashes. Our five senses can perceive only thedenser vibrational fields that reflect light. As the vibration increases iteventually reaches a point where we can no longer see it because it has gonebeyond the frequency range of the five senses. At this stage, to our five-sensereality, it “disappears”. It has done no such thing; it has merely left thefrequency range of our five-sense prison. It hasn’t “disappeared” any more thanRadio 1 “disappears” when you retune to Radio 2.Bands of frequencies have become known as dimensions. For simplicity I willrefer to the frequency range accessible by the five senses as the “ThirdDimension” or “Physical Dimension”. But even then we cannot perceive most ofwhat exists in this one universe alone. According to the latest research,apparently, some 99.5% of it we cannot see. Our eyes can only see matter thatreflects light, what science calls luminous matter. This is why, when you are incomplete darkness, you can’t see anything. Only when you introduce light toreflect from the objects around you can they be seen. Some 99.5% of mass in thisuniverse is called “dark matter” because it does not reflect light. Therefore wecan’t see it. A friend of mine, the Italian physicist Giuliana Conforto,explains all this in simple terms in her superb books, Man’s Cosmic Game andGiordano Bruno’s Future Science.2 In the first book she gave the figure of lessthan 10% of mass can be seen, but new evidence now suggests that we can see only0.5%. We have people making definite judgements and proclaiming certaintiesabout the nature of life and creation when we can’t even see 99.5% of our ownuniverse! It is like spending your entire life in a tiny prison cell on somelittle isolated island and then telling everyone there what the rest of theworld is like. We would say that was the height of stupidity, arrogance andself-delusion, but that is precisely what official “education”, “science” and“media” etc., (and those who accept that version of reality) are doing everyday. So are those conspiracy researchers who say that I must either be crazy orworking for the Illuminati when I take the conspiracy beyond the five-senselevel and into the unseen realms. Well if such people want to stay in jail, theyshould be my guest, but I ain’t keeping them company.When people find it hard to comprehend or understand each other we say they arenot on the same wavelength. That is exactly the case. People stuck at “tentcamps” one, two, or three, are not on the same wavelength as each other and so,as with radio stations, never their minds shall meet. The Infinity Camp is onsuch a different wavelength to those groups still tuned to the various levels ofthe five-sense prison that most people simply cannot comprehend where they arecoming from or what they’re saying. I remember being “interviewed” by a BBCradio host in England called Steve Wright and two others whose reason for beingthere I never did work out. Anyway, it was hilarious to watch them. Their faces,particularly Wright’s, were a picture of total incredulity. It was so funny.Afterwards I had letters from listeners to the programme who understood clearlythe information that Wright and friends could not even begin to fathom. Why?Different wavelengths, different point of observation, different reality. But mymost memorable encounter with a different wavelength was a lady called ChristineSmith from the UK Daily Mirror. After five minutes of talking with this lady andhearing her constant repetition of “yeeaahhh” whenever I completed a sentence, Irealised that nothing was going in, not least because I could see no evidencethat there was anything for it to go in to. Not even the simple suggestion thatthe five senses can’t see everything produced a glimmer of discernable neuronactivity, and it all sailed way over her head. Mind you, it didn’t have to bevery high to do that. I decided that if I had a conversation with the wallbehind her I would definitely glean a more intelligent response. I couldn’t workout if we were actually on different wavelengths or if, in fact, she was not onone at all. Then the stunning realisation hit me. She was a feature writer onthe second biggest selling newspaper in the UK, and sitting at that crucialpoint between what is happening in the world and what the people are told ishappening. Wow. Deep intake of breath, move on.Parallel universesThe official scientific explanations of life are so blatantly absurd that theyhave left the scientific establishment in a maze of dead-end streets. When itcame to the big questions, the contradictions and anomalies, they have nowhereto go unless they change their foundation beliefs and misconceptions.Thankfully, at last, this is beginning to happen among more and more scientists.An edition of the BBC science series Horizon in 2002 was devoted to thegathering acceptance among scientists of the existence of parallel universes orparallel realities, as I prefer to call them. The opening narrative to theprogramme said:> “For almost a hundred years science has been haunted by a dark secret, that> there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond our human senses. Mystics have> long claimed there were such places. They were, they said, full of ghosts and> spirits … but ever since the 19th century physicists have been trying to make> sense of an uncomfortable discovery. When they tried to pin point the exact> location of atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly> impossible. They had no single location … The only explanation that anyone> could come up with is that the particles don’t just exist in our universe.> They slip into existence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite> number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different. In effect,> there’s a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in> another the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in one you were> never born … they are even stranger than Elvis being alive.”Although this was not mentioned in the programme, the reason the particles“appear” and “disappear” is because they are changing frequencies. One scientisttold Horizon that different “universes” had different laws of physics, and AlanGuth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: “… one found that thereality was far stranger than anybody would have invented in the form offiction. Particles really do have the possibility in some sense of being in twodifferent places at the same time.” This may be a scientific “revelation” today,but mystics and their like have known it for thousands of years, and they havebeen ridiculed and burned at the stake for having the audacity to share whatthey know. When I made these points years ago I was labelled a “nutcase”. TheIlluminati have had this knowledge since their creation and they have doneeverything they could to suppress this understanding among the people whileusing it themselves to manipulate, control and delude. They have used both theirreligions and their “science” to do this, but the dam is now collapsing. Sciencestill has a long way to go, however, to match the understandings that existed inwhat we call ancient history, and the parallel universe theory will have toencompass one day an even more amazing fact: we are all “parallel universes” –every single one of us.The great illusionWhat is reality? It is whatever we decide to make it. We all live in our ownindividual, unique, universe. There are points of agreement where our universesmeet and we may, for instance, look out of the window and all agree that we seetrees, houses and cars. Beyond that, however, we see the world in subtlydifferent, or even completely different, ways. We may agree that we see a car,but one person may think it’s lovely and another may think it’s horrible. We mayagree that we are looking at a man or a woman, but one will think the person tobe beautiful while another thinks otherwise. This is because we are on differentwavelengths, observing from a different universe. You could gather together athousand people to consider a topic of debate and you would have, in variousforms, a thousand different perceptions of that subject. They would see the samething in a thousand different ways because they are observing from a thousanddifferent universes … universes of the mind and spirit. Billions of incarnateuniverses on this planet believe that what the five senses perceive is all thatexists. To others that range of perception is such a fraction of all that existsthat it would be impossible to measure. Like I say, we are not talking right andwrong here, just different. What arrogance and delusion it is for one person,one universe, to seek to impose its reality on another. It is psychologicalfascism.What we call reality is simply the wavelength or wavelengths to which we areconnected. Those who can only perceive possibility within the five senses willhave a dramatically different reality to those that can perceive beyond and intothe Great Infinity. One who can accept only the illusions of the five senseswill believe that what they see is all there is; that we are born as some kindof random accident; and that we have anything from a few seconds or 100 years insome kind of chemically created “consciousness” before we cease to exist. Othersmay believe that after “death” they go to some other part of this five-sensereality, some eternal paradise or eternal hell. But those that can perceivebeyond the five-sense prison, however, can see that we are all one infiniteconsciousness; that all energy is consciousness; and that therefore all thatexists in whatever form is part of one unified whole, one infinite mind-spirit.We are all one; we are each other. While the five senses present us with theillusion of division and “empty” space between us, beyond the walls of thisprison of perception is all consciousness and, by definition, all energy. Thereis no “empty” space, between us or anything else; it is energy vibrating to afrequency outside the range of the five senses. Those who have retained orregained their higher senses, their “psychic sensitivities” you might say, canfeel this energy. We sense it as “atmosphere”, good and bad “vibes”, and asfeeling, not thought. Those who have expanded beyond the five senses will beginto understand that divine infinity is an ocean of consciousness vibrating todifferent wavelengths and that we are a droplet within that ocean. Our dropletmanifests itself as our own unique universe within the infinite. We can chooseto disconnect from the infinite and become an isolated droplet and this is whathappens when we accept the five-sense illusion. Our incarnate consciousnessbecomes so mesmerised by the illusions of the five senses that it disconnectsfrom the ocean and lives within an infinitesimal fraction of its infinitepotential. But we can choose to open our hearts and minds to reconnect with allthat we are and then we realise that we not only a droplet in the infiniteocean, we are that ocean. You can pick up a droplet of water in your hand on theseashore and you can look at it in isolation. When we do so we are looking at asymbol, a profound symbol, of most people on planet earth today and for a longtime “past”. They are isolated, disconnected, and with no idea that the oceanexists never mind that they are part of it, indeed they are it. These are thepeople manipulated to believe in the five-sense reality and that alone. If youturn your hand and let the droplet fall back into the water, it is no longerpart of the ocean, it is the ocean, for it is connected to every other droplet.That is our true state. We are infinity. We are all that exists, has existed,and ever will exist. When we break free of the five-sense prison, we begin toaccess greater and greater levels of infinity and our point of observationchanges dramatically.In the world, but not of itAs we progress through the process of deconditioning from the programmedillusions of a lifetime or lifetimes we start to move the focus of ourconsciousness from within the five-sense prison to beyond it. At this point weare observing the prison from outside of its walls. We begin to see what we havebeen part of and deluded by in our five-sense state. We can see the symbolicbars, warders, fences, surveillance cameras and the tiny little cell we havebeen sitting in while thinking we were free. We can see the “electric chairs” –all the manipulated abuses of our mind and body that lead us to kill thephysical vehicle that allows us to experience this “world”. When we connect withthis level of our consciousness beyond the physical illusion we are in this“world” in a physical sense, but we are no longer of it. The vast majority atthis time who remain imprisoned by the five senses are so deeply deluded bytheir constantly conditioned reality that they believe that spending a lifetimein a mental, emotional and, increasingly, physical prison cell is living in afree world. They are so caught in the illusion that they cannot see the bars.They sit there, unquestioning, unchallenging and oblivious of their plight. Ifyou were the Illuminati and your desire was to control the people of this planetand manipulate them to build a world in your image in line with your agenda fora global dictatorship, what state of being would you like your targets toexpress? Would it be easier to control people mesmerised by the five-senseillusion? Or would it be easier to try to control incarnate consciousness stillconnected to levels beyond this “world” – consciousness that could look intothis prison from outside and see it for what it is? The question answers itself.Curse of ignoranceIt is for this reason that throughout what we call history there has been anonslaught against the knowledge that reveals the nature of reality and those whocommunicate it. This is what the inquisitions were really all about, taking theknowledge out of circulation. Hundreds of thousands of “witches” were hung andburned because they carried knowledge of life beyond the five-sense prison, andhow to communicate with it. As the Illuminati manipulated over thousands ofyears, especially through the Roman Empire and those that followed in Europe,they used the cover of Christianity to destroy the knowledge of who we are,where we come from and the nature of life. When these empires went into Asia,Africa, the Americas and elsewhere they sought to destroy the knowledge held inthose ancient societies. They slaughtered the shamen and others who were thecarriers and communicators of the knowledge across the generations. This is whythe esoteric, the “occult”, or “paranormal” is dismissed as either crazy orevil. As I have detailed in previous books, the Illuminati not only infiltratedwhat we call the “scientific establishment”, they created it. They introducedthe very version of the this-world-is-all-there-is “science” that is taught asunquestionable fact in the schools and universities. To progress in science isvirtually impossible unless you promote, or at least do not expose, thisludicrous vision of the world and creation. “Science” is policed by this mindsetbecause official science is not overwhelmingly about discovery; it is aboutselling a lie to hide the truth from the people. Ask a scientist who haschallenged the official version, and let him or her tell you what happens totheir career. When Galileo had the audacity to say that the earth was a sphereand not flat he was put under house arrest for the last eight years of his life.The same happens today, it’s just a little more subtle that’s all. Well, most ofthe time it is. Control of science and scientists is essential to the Illuminatiagenda because if we had free-thinking science the human race would have beenaware long ago of the nature of reality. In fact without the suppression itwould never have forgotten.The Illuminati have used two apparent “opposites” to control the reality ofpeople: official science and the greatest form of mind control ever invented –religion. These are seen as opposites, as polarities, but they are oppo-sames.They are the same outcome by a different route. “Science” has basically told usthat the world that we see is all that exists and that what happens to us in ourfew years of consciousness is as random as life itself. Religion tells us thatif we do as it says we will go to paradise as a chosen one. If we do not do asit says we shall spend our eternity in the fires of hell. Both “opposites” havea common theme. You are not in control of your life; you are either a randomaccident or the pawn in the game of some dictator god who is so loving he willcondemn you to an eternity of suffering for having the nerve not to do what themen in frocks tell you. The common theme is that you are ordinary and powerless,and you must look outside of yourself, to others, to tell you what you shouldthink, do and say.The five-sense prisonIt is clear why the Illuminati have spent so much time and effort destroying andsuppressing the knowledge of reality, consciousness and creation that would setus free of the five-sense illusion. The last thing they want us to have is theknowledge that we are all that exists and that whenever we choose we can accessan infinity of love, wisdom, understanding and intuitive “knowing” from ourhigher levels of consciousness. The foundation of the Illuminati control of thisplanet is the control of our reality and our imagination of ourselves. It isdesigned to so disconnect incarnate consciousness from its multi-dimensional,infinite self that it becomes an isolated droplet in a five-sense prison. Whenwe concede to that conditioning we cease to be the ocean. This disconnecteddroplet, imprisoned in a physical body, then looks to the five senses for a fixon itself and reality. And from what sources do those five senses gather their“information” and “guidance”? From the eyes and the ears – the “information”that bombards those senses minute by minute through the “education” system,politics, “science” and the media. All these sources are controlled and createdby the Illuminati to condition the population to believe in a five-sensereality. The technique is so simple. You thought-police the five-sense prisonand you destroy, suppress, ridicule or demonise the knowledge of who we reallyare and the infinity beyond the lower senses. You say that psychics who areconnecting with some of these other levels of consciousness are mad, deluded orin league with the “Devil”. People who have experiences that cannot be explainedby the laughable limitations of five-sense reality are similarly dismissed anddiscarded. Once you have created this structure, anyone born into it isimmediately subjected to a lifetime of constant conditioning to mould a realitythat suits the agenda and maintains the target in mental, emotional andspiritual enslavement. Only a few in these circumstances have the wisdom anddetermination to seek their own truth and not the one dictated to them by thosethat control the flow of what is bravely called “information”. It is to hold ourfocus in the five senses that we are subjected to a minute-by-minute onslaughtof five-sense stimulation through advertising, the media, movies, food, drinkand sex. There is nothing wrong with such stimulation because it is one level ofexperience, but the aim is to so addict the five senses that this becomes ouronly level of experience and perception. I must say they have done a bloody goodjob so far, but we are now entering a very different era.We can talk about secret societies and Bilderberg Groups and all these othername, date, people, expressions of the conspiracy, and we should because thatawareness is important. But all the countless aspects of this conspiracy aredesigned to one end: the manipulation of humanity’s imagination of itself andthe conditioning of our reality. How we see ourselves and the world dictates ourbehaviour and our perception of others. Control the sense of reality and youcontrol the person completely. A brilliant American comedian called Bill Hicksused to say:> “Matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. We are all one> consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There’s no such thing as> death, life is just a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.”The Illuminati conspiracy can be summed up in one sentence: the manipulation ofhumanity’s imagination of itself. The events of September 11th have had amassive effect on the human perception and sense of reality – exactly asplanned.Mirror, mirror, on the wall …The five-sense realm does not really exist as a physical “world”. It is amirror, a reflection, of our inner state of being. If you stand in front of amirror you see a reflection of yourself. It’s not you, it’s not real, it’s areflection. You are in control of that reflection because the image in themirror cannot move, open and close its eyes, or wave its arms around unless youchoose to do that. If you imagine your consciousness to be you looking in themirror and you imagine the reflection to be the world that you see through youreyes and experience as your “life”, then perhaps you can appreciate what I meanwhen I say that five-sense reality is an illusion. As Albert Einstein put it:“Reality is just an illusion, albeit a persistent one.” When we look through oureyes at the five-sense mirror we are looking at a reflection of ourselves, bothindividually and collectively. We cannot hide from ourselves, much as we wouldlike to, because we are looking ourselves in the face every waking second ofevery day. Indeed that is the very point in being here – so consciousness canobserve itself. If we are consumed by inner conflict and insecurity, if we arefull of fear, anger and frustration with no love for ourselves, this willreflect in the “mirror” I call the five-sense “world”. A war is the outerconflict reflecting the inner conflict. The Illuminati know that if they canmanipulate and stimulate inner conflict, the outer one will be easy to manifest.If we feel ourselves to be insignificant, powerless and ordinary that willreflect in the five-sense mirror as a life experience that is without power. Wewill be just another sheep in the pen considered by ourselves and others to beinsignificant and expendable. In truth we are none of those things. We aregenius incarnate, infinity incarnate, if we choose to be. But when our isolated,disconnected, droplet of consciousness is programmed to believe that negativeversion of ourselves, we reflect that state of being into the five-sense mirrorand “live” that imagination of ourselves, that reality. We are what we believeourselves to be and the Illuminati’s most important goal is to tell us what tobelieve ourselves to be. Once you reconnect to the infinite ocean you begin tounderstand that nothing and no one is powerless, ordinary or insignificant. Toclaim so is to say that divine infinity is all of those things. You start torealise that if we change our imagination of ourselves we can live our lives asthe incarnate ocean and not as a disconnected droplet; as infinity and not onlyas far as our eyes can see. Then we can tap into and express the full magnitudeof who we really are and the Illuminati’s juvenile game will be over.Seeing is believingThe Illuminati are desperate for us to believe that the mirror is real. That waywe will spend our lives trying to change the reflection from inside thereflection. Impossible. The only way to change a reflection is to change what isbeing reflected – our inner state of being. When we change, the world mustchange, but not until. The Illuminati know this and they have no problem withthe Far Left attacking the Far Right and so on. For goodness sake, they aremanipulating that division and conflict. They want people believing that toaffect the five-sense prison you have to take action with the five senses –condemn, protest, “fight” for what you believe in. But unless the inner changes,the outer cannot. It doesn’t matter if you are a Far Right fascist who wants toimpose his will and fight the hated Left; or if you are a Far Left Communist whowants to impose his will on others and fight the hated Right; or if you are fromthe Extreme Centre and wants to impose your will on others and fight the FarRight and the Far Left. There is a common theme that unites them all and theyneed each other to go on “fighting”. If the inner wants to “fight” for anything– for control, for dictatorship, for freedom, for justice and all the otherendless things that people “fight for” – what are they all doing? They areadding their contribution to the “fight”, the conflict. We don’t have to fightfor freedom, we just have to be free. If the inner decides to be free, the outerexpression will reflect that freedom. If the inner decides that it needs to“fight” for freedom, it’s outer reflection will be the experience of “fighting.”Don’t fight for it. Don’t hope for it. Don’t campaign for it. Just be it.Billions of people are spending their lives thrashing around in a reflection andgetting more and more frightened, angry, stressed and frustrated that nothing ischanging and things are only getting worse. But of course nothing is changing asthey would wish. How can it? It’s getting worse because the more frightened,angry, stressed, and frustrated people become at aimlessly thrashing around in areflection while thinking it’s real, the more their mental and emotional state“gets worse” and so must reflect in the mirror as the world “getting worse”. Itis a vicious circle that can only be broken when we realise that five-sensereality is an illusion and we are creating it. We can have a five-sense illusionthat is a prison because inner prisons must become outer prisons; or we can havean illusion that is a paradise. It’s our choice, our decision, but whatever wechoose, the five-sense “world” will still be an illusion, a reflection, becausethat is what it is meant to be: a mirror through which consciousness can observeitself.Playing with our mindsThis knowledge of consciousness held in the secret society networks forthousands of years has allowed the Illuminati to manipulate the minds of anignorant humanity and never more so than today. I feel for people who live inthe United States because they are subjected to some of the fiercest realityconditioning anywhere on the planet. I would suggest that there is a reason forthis – the United States (a private corporation) was set up from the start as amind-control experiment. Americans are seen as the most powerful nation on earthand technologically the most advanced. It is even believed, shock of shocks,that the USA is the home of freedom. I remember my own experience in 1996 when Itravelled the United States for three months and found it to be one of the mostcontrolled, dictatorial societies I had ever seen. But because of the mantra of“this is the land of the free” most people don’t realise what a dictatorshipthey live in. People complain that “American culture” is taking over the worldbecause McDonald’s, Burger King and all the other symbols of American societyare everywhere. Hollywood, television and advertising are dominated by Americansettings and influences. But this is not “American culture” that we are seeingexported to every corner of the world, it is those experiments to suppress thehuman body, mind and emotions that have been seen to have the desired effectwithin the experimental human laboratory known as the United States. When it hasbeen shown to work there, the rest of us get it. From America has come thefast-food onslaught on human physiology; “soundbite” journalism in whichsubstance is sacrificed to the superficial; the obsession with material symbolsand trinkets as a measure of human “success” and achievement. Americanisation isIlluminatisation. That’s why I feel for Americans because they are at thesharpest end of all of this conditioning of human perception. What applies toindividuals in the Illuminati mind-control programmes also applies to thepopulation as a whole. In the UK the psychologists, social workers and police,glean their knowledge of Multiple Personality Disorder or Dissociative IdentityDisorder (used to create mind-controlled slaves) from the Illuminati TavistockGroup (see The Biggest Secret). Dr William Sargant, a psychiatrist withTavistock, wrote in his 1957 book, The Battle For The Mind:> “Various types of belief can be implanted in people after brain function has> been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear,> anger, or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances the most> common one is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility.> Its various group manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of> “herd instinct”, and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe> epidemics, and all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety> and so individual and mass suggestibility.> “… We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective> psyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authorities to ‘protect people’> from that fear.” 3When the Illuminati unleash their wars, Wacos, Oklahoma bombs and 9/11s, theyare using trauma-based mind control on the population because they know that atraumatised mind is a suggestible one. This fits the goals ofproblem-reaction-solution perfectly because once you have created the event andgleaned the reaction of fear, the minds of the people are suggestible to the“solutions” the perpetrators offer. Proposing the slaughter of thousands ofcivilians and their children in Afghanistan would have caused outrage among manyif it had been suggested without September 11th. But after those attacks in NewYork and Washington there was no problem. For this reason we are going to seemore “terrorist attacks”, not least involving chemicals and disease, to keep thepeople traumatised and open to future stages of the “war on terrorism”. Onceagain we have the common theme here – the control and manipulation of reality.Who controls the controllers?Only by understanding the nature of reality can we answer the obvious questionthat comes from the information I present about the bloodlines and how long theyhave been manipulating this five-sense reality. The question of why would peoplededicate their lives to the plan for global domination when they knew they wouldbe dead long before the goal was reached. How about if the entities controllingthe bodies of those in power through the ages have largely been the same onesall along? What if they operate just beyond the frequency range of the fivesenses and use apparently “human” physical bodies to manipulate the five-senseworld? What if when one body gives up on them at “death” they just move intoanother and continue the manipulation, the long-term agenda, for another periodof “time”? The area of my research that people find most difficult to comprehendis that the bloodlines placed in the positions of power throughout the world arenot “human” in the sense that we understand that term. I appreciate why peoplefind that so difficult because being caught in the five-sense illusion includesbeing subconsciously programmed to believe that if you can’t see it, it doesn’texist. I have revealed in considerable detail in my last two books, The BiggestSecret and Children Of The Matrix, the staggering number of people, both ancientand modern, who have told of the same experience – seeing an apparently humanbeing, often people in power, transform in front of their eyes from a human bodyto that of a reptilian entity. Others have seen the same transformation, aphenomenon known as “shape-shifting”, involving other non-human entities and notonly reptilian. But the reptilian form is by far the most common theme among theendless people I have spoken with around the world. This also appears to be thecase with the ancient accounts from all over the planet detailing the sameexperience. I am not going into all that again here because I have covered thisat great length already in previous books. But I want to emphasise why thisphenomenon is possible. To the conditioned five-sense reality the idea is crazy,bizarre and ludicrous. If people wish to believe that, go ahead, it makes nodifference to me either way. But are those people saying that only that whichthey have seen with their eyes or has been accepted as real by official sourcescan exist?People will just have to believe what they want to believe and I have no desirewhatsoever to convince anyone of anything. It really doesn’t matter to me eitherway if people accept what I say or not. But after all these years of full-timeresearch, which has taken me to 40 countries, thousands of people and countlessancient and modern accounts, it is clear that this “world” or frequency range,the five-sense prison, is manipulated from outside by non-human entities thattake over or “possess” the apparently “human” bodies of the Illuminatibloodlines. You can read the detailed background in The Biggest Secret andChildren Of The Matrix, but in summary this is the situation we face. Betweendimensions, in this case between the third dimension (the five-sense prison) andthe next one, the fourth dimension, are little “crevices” of frequency. TheItalian physicist Giuliana Conforto, author of Man’s Cosmic Game, calls them“inter-space planes” and they lie between the dimensions or, as the scientistscalled them in the Horizon programme, parallel universes. It is in theinter-space plane, Giuliana suggested to me, that these reptilian and otherentities reside. This is the realm of the “demons” of folklore that have beenfrightening and manipulating humans for as long as ancient accounts go back. InChildren Of The Matrix I quote the work of Maurice Doreal who says that in 1925he recovered ancient tablets tens of thousands of years old that had been placedunder a Mayan Temple of the Sun God in the Yucatan, Mexico, and it is said thatthe tablets originated in the continent known as Atlantis that was lost toenormous geological cataclysm a long time ago. They have become known as theEmerald Tablets of Thoth, and Doreal’s translations refer to the inter-spaceplanes of Giuliana Conforto as “spaces and planes unknown to man”.4 Thetranslations also say that in these spaces and planes are the serpent beingsthat manipulate this world. In South Africa, Credo Mutwa, the famous Zulu Sanusi(shaman) and official historian of the Zulu nation, recounts the same story. Hetold me that in ancient African accounts passed down through the ages, theycalled the inter-space planes the “heavens between heavens” and this, he said,was where the reptilian beings reside that manipulate our world. In frequencyterms, the inter-space plane is very close to the range of the five senses, butjust outside, just beyond the range that our eyes can see. However, if someonewith psychic sight can extend their vibrational range a little they can connectwith that frequency range and see some of these entities – and they do. Peoplewho have taken mind-altering drugs that break through the vibrational walls ofthe five senses and allow consciousness to see beyond it have had the sameexperience. Also, if these entities lower their vibration only slightly to enterthe five-sense range they become visible to us here and people from all walks oflife all over the world have told me a stream of accounts detailing this veryexperience (see Children Of The Matrix and The Biggest Secret). Those who haveexperienced Illuminati blood and sacrifice rituals have also told me manystories of seeing this “shape-shifting” transformation from “human” to reptilianamong the participants. As the Horizon science programme about paralleluniverses said:> “The only explanation that anyone could come up with is that the particles> don’t just exist in our universe. They slip into existence in other universes,> too, and there are an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them> slightly different.”It is possible for particles to move between “universes” or “realities” and“dimensions” and so it is possible for entities, consisting of particles, to dothe same. This is a major reason why the Illuminati bloodlines have taken partin these rituals from ancient times to the present day. The rituals allow themto connect with their masters in the inter-space planes, not least because humanblood and the vibrational fields created by the rituals produce the frequencyenvironment in which the reptilian and other entities can manifest in thefive-sense frequency range. Credo Mutwa has described to me how he witnessedrituals decades ago at which people in the room shifted from a human to areptilian form, but there have been countless other people from very differentcultures and backgrounds who have described the same experience of what happensonce the blood begins to flow. Maurice Doreal’s translations of the ancientEmerald Tablets reveal:> “Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved into> darkness, using dark magic, calling up beings from the great below us. Forth> came they into this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existing> unseen by the children of earth-men. Only through blood could they form being,> only through man could they live in the world.> “In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the place> whence they came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces and> planes unknown to man. Lived they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times they> appeared among men. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth they came to dwell> among men.”This brings us to the reason why the Illuminati are obsessed with bloodline.The bloodlinesThousands of years ago, indeed aeons probably, a non-human race interbred withhumans to create hybrid bloodlines and this story is told in every nativeculture. Such sources retain far more of the true history of human existencethan the manipulated and mendacious “history” taught in today’s schools anduniversities. We even see an expression of these accounts in that amalgamationof ancient writings, some real, some added much later, that we know as the OldTestament. This tells of the Sons of God (sons of the gods in the truetranslation) who interbred with the daughters of men to create the hybrid race,the Nefilim. The accounts say that the Nefilim caused mayhem wherever they went.Different versions of the Nefilim story with the same common theme can be foundall over the world and South African shamen like Credo Mutwa, for example, referto the Nefilim as the Chitauri – the “Children of the Serpent” or “Children ofthe Python” because this non-human race takes a reptilian form. Such accountsare featured in detail in Children Of The Matrix and The Biggest Secret, as arethe modern accounts of insiders who have confirmed to me that the world isindeed controlled by bloodlines that are not in fact “human”, butreptilian-human hybrids. By “insiders” I mean those who work for this networkagainst their will; those who have experienced its privileges and diabolicalrituals before turning against it; and those who have been victims of itsgrotesque agenda and mind-control projects. The ancient idea of the Divine Rightto Rule, the right to rule because of your bloodline, originates from thisinterbreeding. The “divine” does not relate to “God”, the Infinite Spirit, butto the “gods”, the non-human entities involved in the interbreeding. They becameknown as the “dragon bloodlines” and the symbol of the dragon comes from thesereptilian “gods”. Chinese emperors claimed the right to rule through theirgenetic connection to the serpent gods and still today we have “royal” familiesaround the world who come to the throne only because of their DNA and for noother reason. In more recent times these bloodlines have moved out of the overtpositions of “royal” power and dictatorship because people would no longer standfor that form of rule. Now they dominate the population in another way, throughpolitics, banking, business and media ownership.The bloodlines that manipulate the world today are genetically connected throughthis hybrid DNA, a genetic fusion caused by the interbreeding of humans with the“gods”, as the ancients perceived this non-human race. This interbreedingcontinues to the present day as thousands of accounts around the world confirm.If you are hearing this for the first time, I know how bizarre and crazy itsounds to the conditioned view of reality. But you will see in my other booksthe scale of the evidence to support this apparently ridiculous story and how itexplains a stream of ancient and modern ‘mysteries’. So many things that laterturn out to be true appear at first hearing to be impossible and insane. That’sbecause people only hear the opening line and don’t read on to see the detailedevidence to support it, and also because most people are conditioned to believethat anything beyond their perception cannot, by definition, be true. Whenpeople first suggested the earth was round, they were called crazy because itwas thought that those living on the bottom would have fallen off. The criticsdismissed the idea at this point and walked away convinced that the earth had tobe flat. Yet when you introduce the law of gravity, what seemed at first to becrazy suddenly became far more credible. So it is with the fact that a non-humanrace is controlling and manipulating humanity through hybrid bloodlines – thesame bloodlines that have been placed in positions of power since ancient times.The supporting evidence is there if only people are prepared to open their mindsand remove their backside from the furniture.These bloodlines have what has been described to me by insiders as a “corruptedDNA”, corrupted by the interbreeding, and you find similar stories among theancient accounts also. The DNA is the body’s genetic blueprint and can have amassive effect on behaviour. One consequence of this corruption is that thesebloodlines do not have the same emotional responses as the rest of the earthpeople. We have an emotional “fail-safe” mechanism in which the consequences ofknowing what our actions would do to others act, most of the time, as a defenceagainst extreme behaviour like torture, mass murder, abusing children and so on.However, when, as in the case of these bloodlines, you are not subject to suchemotional responses then you can do anything to any number of people withoutexperiencing the emotional fall-out. Killing thousands in the World Trade Centeror Afghanistan is no emotional challenge for you. It is just another day’s“work”, another step on the road to global domination. To you the humanpopulation is seen in the same way as most humans see cattle. We see constantexamples of this “cold-blooded” DNA in action among today’s world leaders. Thecorrupted DNA has a vibrational sympathy with the reptilian entities of theinter-space plane. This allows them to possess these bodies far more easily thanthose with non-corrupted DNA. The Emerald Tablets, as translated by MauriceDoreal, describe how the serpent entities of another frequency possessed thebodies of those in power in this five-sense reality:> “In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as are> men. Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as men> among men. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.> Slaying by their arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and ruling> o’er man. Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their> faces be seen. Sought they from the kingdom of shadows to destroy man and rule> in his place.”The five-sense “world” has been manipulated by these inter-space reptilian andother entities for at least thousands of years and it is done by possessing thehybrid bloodlines and taking over their mental processes. This means that if theIlluminati, the reptilian network in human form, can manipulate these bloodlinesor bodies with the corrupted DNA into the positions of power they are puttingthe reptilian entities into those positions. Here you have the reason why UnitedStates presidents are so genetically connected and why they go back to the royaland aristocratic families of Europe who, in turn, descend from the ruling royalfamilies of the ancient world going back to when the interbreeding began. Youalso have the reason why the Illuminati families are obsessed withinterbreeding: it is to protect the corrupted DNA that can be quickly diluted ifit is bred with DNA that is not corrupted. The Illuminati have arrangedmarriages on the basis of genetics and most of them are sham relationships toproduce the children. They also use artificial breeding programmes to pass onthe genetic “purity” they so desperately desire to maintain. To them the “humanbody” is only a vehicle for them to operate in this five-sense frequency range.What you see is their five-sense human body. What you don’t see is what islooking through its eyes from the inter-space plane. If you saw the movie, TheMatrix, you will recall how the “agents”, who were manipulating the masses andcontrolling the computer-generated illusion, could come in and out of that“world” by moving in and out of different “human” bodies. The same principleapplies to the reptilians and other entities in the five-sense reality that welive in. According to the translations of the Emerald Tablets the reptilianinfluence was acknowledged and dealt with in the distant past, but the tabletswarned:> “Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open at times to the> world. Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been said;> again as time passes onward shall they take the semblance of men.”And they have. The major players in the Illuminati and those behind 9/11 and the“war on terrorism” are reptilian inter-space entities occupying human formwithin the five-sense world and they are not “American” or “British” or“Chinese”, they are entities manipulating through those physical forms and haveno allegiance to the people they “lead”. They could not care less if an Americandies for their cause or a Chinese because they identify with neither. Thereptilian connection is the reason for the explosion of reptilian symbolismamong Illuminati organisations. (See The Biggest Secret and the symbolismarchive at davidicke.com [http://www.davidicke.com] for more.) The inter-spacereptilians have an undeveloped emotional level, which allows them to cause deathand destruction while feeling no emotional consequence for the suffering theycause. They are beings of thought and ritualistic instinct, not feeling. Morethan that, their whole aim is to cause slaughter and pain because of the energythat this generates.Reptilians Inc.Physicist Giuliana Conforto tells me that inter-space planes do not have anatural energy source like a dimension. Any entities operating there would needto create an energy source for themselves and they have – fear. When we feelfear it generates a vibration, an energy field. Every time we think and feel, nomatter what our state of being may be, we are sending out “broadcast” waves thatvibrate to the frequency of the particular thought or emotion. We feel thesefrequencies coming from people in what we call “vibes”. The low vibration offear and its associated emotions like anger, aggression, stress and guiltproduce frequencies that pour into the inter-space plane and this has become theenergy source of these reptilian and other entities. The more humanity feelsfear in all its forms the more energy – power – the reptilians have to sustainthem and use back against us. The entire Illuminati system has been designed togenerate the energy of fear and turn the human population into an inter-spaceenergy source. Appropriately, in the movie, The Matrix, the character calledMorpheus holds up a battery and says: “The Matrix is a computer-generated dreamworld built to keep us under control in order to change the human being intothis.” The recent major children’s movie called Monsters Inc. had the sametheme. The “monster” world did not have an energy source and so they walkedthrough “doors” (interdimensional gateways) into children’s bedrooms in thehuman world. There they would frighten children and when the kids screamed withfear the monsters would capture that energy and take it back through the door topower their world. This is one major aspect of September 11th and its aftermaththat is not acknowledged because it is so far from conditioned reality. Butimagine the fear generated as a result of 9/11. Imagine how much has beengenerated by two world wars, the “war on terrorism”, and a political, financial,business, military, and media system that is specifically designed to maintainhumanity in a constant state of fear, worry, stress, and anger. Take anotherlook at the micro-chipping programme from this perspective. Once people aremicro-chipped they can be externally triggered through the chip to produce fearon demand. Get a micro-chip and be a battery, you know it makes sense. In thelight of all this, take another look at that coded speech by George W. Bushafter 9/11:> “The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a> cult of evil that seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.> Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by> tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice while daring to claim> the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of> evil; it is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in the> terrorists evil has found a willing servant.”image [../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 30: The reptilian brain or “R-complex” is an ancient part of the humanbrain. From here we get the character traits of cold-blooded behaviour, thedesire for top-down hierarchy, and an obsession with ritual. These are balancedby other parts of the brain in humans, but not in the full-blown reptilians,which manipulate this planet The cruelty that is “fed, not weakened, by tears”. Exactly.Reptilian brainThe more we understand the reptilian mind the more we can understand both thebehaviour of the Illuminati across the centuries and the global society they arecreating. They have distinct character traits and they are seeking to makehumans the same.These reptilian characteristics and their connection to the human brain arefundamental to the perpetuation of the illusions of the five-sense world that Icall the Matrix. The most ancient part of the human brain is known by scientistsas the R-complex or “reptilian brain” (Figure 30). It is the most obviousremnant of our reptilian genetic history, along with those people around theworld still being born with tails (see Children Of The Matrix). This reptilianbrain is vital to understanding the ways in which the Illuminati manipulatehuman thinking and perception. Most people have no idea of the reptilianheritage of the human body and its influence on our behaviour. Scientists saythat the reptilian brain represents a core of the nervous system, and look atthe character traits of the reptilian brain as agreed by scientists. I quotehere from an Internet article by Skip Largent:> “At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain … Without> defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find> expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and> superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things;> ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as in legal, religious,> cultural, and other matters … and all manner of deceptions.” 5Add other traits of the reptilian brain such as “territoriality” (this is mine,keep out); an obsession with hierarchical structures of rule and control;aggression; and the idea that might is right, winner takes all, and you have thevery characteristics displayed by the Illuminati and their agents for thousandsof years. You simply could not describe them better than to list the traits ofthe reptilian brain. Racism comes from the reptilian brain, also, and theaggressive, violent sex that the Illuminati bloodlines indulge in big time – askFather Bush, Cheney, President Gerald Ford, and other Illuminati names I exposein my books. Can it really be a coincidence that the Illuminati manifest theclassic traits of the reptilian brain while, at the same time, the evidencemounts that they are reptilian bloodlines? Cosmologist Carl Sagan, who knew farmore than he was telling, wrote a book called The Dragons of Eden6 to highlightthe reptilian influences on humanity. He said: “… It does no good whatsoever toignore the reptilian component of human nature, particularly our ritualistic andhierarchical behaviour. On the contrary, the model may help us understand whathuman beings are really about.” Other areas of the human brain balance theextremes of the reptilian characteristics in most people, but they can still beseen, for example, in those who live their lives as a daily ritual, such asgoing to the same supermarket at the same time every week and having the samemeals on the same days. The Illuminati have sought to turn society into aclock-watching, ever repeating daily cycle, because that locks the people whosuccumb to this into their reptilian level of perception and further activatesthe reptilian brain. They have also created a society in which most people arefocused on physical or financial survival, and the survival mentality is areptilian instinct. The whole Illuminati agenda is based on the terror of notsurviving and they equate control with survival. Their survival where theycurrently reside in the inter-space plane is also dependent on humans continuingto be their energy source. Their horrific agenda is based on survival in theirreptilian minds. Those with the most dominant reptilian genetics, theIlluminati, obviously express more of the characteristics associated with thereptilian brain and this is why, as detailed at length in my other books, theIlluminati are utterly obsessed with ritual.They also know better than anyone how to manipulate the reptilian brain orR-complex of humans and it is through that part of the brain that humanity ismost controlled and directed. The human brain is in two parts, or hemispheres,the right brain and the left-brain, connected by a mass of nerve fibres. Theleft side is rational, logical, and “intellectual”. It works closely with thephysical senses and can be summed up by can I touch it, see it, hear it, smellit or taste it? It communicates through spoken and written words. The rightbrain is where we manifest imagination, intuition, instincts, dream-states, thesubconscious. It is the artist, musician, creative inspiration. It communicatesthrough images and symbols, not words. This right side is closely related to thereptilian part of the brain. Reptilians communicate through imagery and symbols– just like the Illuminati secret society network. They have an entire secretlanguage based on symbols. This brings us to the most effective form of humanconditioning by the Illuminati – movies and television. As Skip Largent writes:> “All movies and television are a projection of the reptilian brain. How so?> Movies and television (video games etc.) are all undeniably dreamlike, not> only in their presentation of symbolic-reality, but also in that humans> experiencing movies, etc., have the same brain wave patterns as when they are> dreaming. And guess where dreaming originates in your head? In the reptilian> brain (although other parts of our brain are involved) … The “language” of the> reptilian brain is visual imagery. All communications transferred by reptiles> are done so by visual symbolic representations, each having specific meaning.”> 7This is precisely what the Illuminati do through their symbolism. The movie andtelevision industries are not only owned by the Illuminati – they created them.They understand how visual images can be used to condition the population. Innormal circumstances, the reptilian-dominated right brain receives imagesthrough the eyes or the imagination, and the left brain decodes those imagesinto thoughts and conclusions. The Illuminati have intervened in this process,however, to control human perception. Their aim is to disconnect the functionsof these two distinct parts of the brain so we can be manipulated through theright brain while only being conscious of the left. They plant images into theright brain (the dream-state, the non-conscious) using symbolism, subliminalimagery and pictures, while often telling the left-brain how it should interpretthose images. This is done through “education”, “science” and the media.Television news is a classic. The right brain is shown pictures and thereporter’s voiceover tells the left brain what they mean. During the Kosovoconflict we were shown pictures of refugees fleeing across the border and thevoiceover said they were actually fleeing Serbian atrocities. This “explanation”(this sense of reality) increased public support for NATO bombing of the Serbs.What later emerged is that many of the refugees were fleeing the effects of NATObombing. Same images, but a very different reality. What is happening all thetime is that the left brain is being told by external sources how to decoderight-brain images. What we urgently need to do is regain control of our leftbrains and decide for ourselves what we are seeing.You will find that words like imagination, imagine, dream and suchlike are usedconstantly in advertising. They know that if they can use those trigger wordsthat encourage the right-brain, non-conscious, daydream state, they can accessyour mind with imagery and then tell your left brain how to decode that intoconscious language – “I want that car”; “I think the police should be given morepowers to stop crime”; “I need Viagra to be a real man again”; “We need a worldgovernment to solve our problems”. Television and movies are producing a fantasyworld of make-believe to open up the unconscious right brain and allow theIlluminati secret access through that to the conscious mind. Children are mostat risk from this and they are being bombarded by fantasy images to this end. Inearly childhood the mental state is controlled almost exclusively by thereptilian brain and the purveyors of children’s “entertainment”, like Disney,exploit this knowledge. I was also interested to find an article in the LosAngeles Times while writing this chapter that highlighted another trait of thereptilian brain – greed and excess. The article was headed “Living Ever Larger;How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in Southern California”. Frenchanthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille is quoted as saying:> “… the desire for excess comes from the ‘reptilian brain,’ the earliest, most> primitive structures in our mental evolution. The reptilian wants to grab as> much food as possible, to be as big and powerful as possible, because it’s> focused on survival. When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the> reptilian, the reptilian always wins.> “Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have> left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago, and> more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and diabetes. We’re racking up> mountains of debt (the late fees we pay on credit cards have more than tripled> since 1996, to $7.3 billion a year) and burning up fossil fuels like crazy. We> demand things that, deep down, we don’t really want or even use …” 8The “American culture” that is being exported across the world by the day is theculture of the reptilian brain and that’s exactly what it was designed to befrom the start when the Illuminati based in Britain and other European centresconfiscated the lands of the Native Americans and set up their “New Atlantis”,as the initiate Francis Bacon called it. I am convinced the “Old Atlantis” wentthe same way before it collapsed amid cataclysmic events. Readers of my otherbooks will know the emphasis I place on the Illuminati’s obsession with bloodrituals and human sacrifice. Stories like that of Bram Stoker’s shape-shifting,blood-drinking Dracula, are not just fantasies. They are based on what isactually going on in the world every day (see The Biggest Secret and Children OfThe Matrix). I was interested to come across an article in a 1999 Bram StokerSociety Newsletter about the reptilian nature of the Dracula character:> “… even writers of the century that has seen Dracula’s redemption are not> blind to the old creature’s inhuman, threatening nature. Valdine Clemens> writes of ‘Dracula: The Reptilian Brain at the Fin de Siecle,’ contrasting the> novel’s extensive use of modern technological devices (typewriter, phonograph,> telephone, hypodermic injection, blood transfusion) with Dracula’s reliance on> a literally ‘reptilian’ way of thinking. Vampires and reptiles share not only> the traits of not caring for their young, lack of sexual bonds, and lack of> the mammalian capacity for play, but the primitive ‘reptile brain’s’ reliance> on instinct and habit. Amanda Fernbach, in ‘Dracula’s Decadent Fetish,’> explicates another of … Dracula’s … threats: ‘[Dracula] offers a decadent> deconstruction of gender, presenting images of feminized men and masculinized> women under the sign of vampirism.’ In ‘Corruption Becomes Itself Corrupt’> Marion Muirhead shows Dracula as a vehicle of entropy, a Victorian-era answer> to the late twentieth century phenomenon of the serial killer.” 9Again, all the traits you find in the Illuminati are there. As the article says:“vampires and reptiles share not only the traits of not caring for their young,lack of sexual bonds, and lack of the mammalian capacity for play, but theprimitive ‘reptile brain’s’ reliance on instinct and habit”. This lack of caringfor their young is how the Illuminati families can put their children throughhorrendous rituals to bring them into line. Look at the British royal family,the reptilian Windsors, and consider how they have brought up their children insuch an emotionless way. So many families of the aristocracy are the same. Thereare many more evolved reptilians that have moved beyond these base reptilianinstincts, but they are not the ones behind the Illuminati.Activating the bloodlineThe major and ancient Illuminati families know who they are and their hybridnature, but there are many other offshoots within societies all over the worldwho have no idea that they carry the hybrid corruption. Nor are they trying tomanipulate anyone. From what I have learned over the years the DNA corruptionlies dormant unless it is activated and until that point it has no effect on theperson. Such people go through life oblivious of their bloodline. However, ifthey come into contact with the vibrational code that activates the corruptionthen that is a very different story. They become seriously open to possession bythe inter-space entities. This vibrational code or key is generated at thesecret society rituals of the Illuminati network and this is another reason whythey have performed the same basic rituals since ancient times. They aredesigned to produce the vibrational code that activates the DNA corruption andopens the vibrational door to the inter-space entities. The children ofIlluminati families are put through the rituals by their parents in the fullknowledge that they are being opened to possession so the baton can be passed onto the next generation. Talk to anyone who has been involved in Satanism andthey will tell you that its hierarchy is decided by the power of the demonicentities that you allow to possess your body during the rituals designed forthis end. The theme of “selling your soul to the Devil” is a valid one in thesense that Satanists allow their bodies to be possessed in return for power inthe five-sense world. The same applies to the Illuminati and in fact Satanism isone of the strands in their web.The story for those who are not born into the Illuminati families and have noidea of their bloodline is rather different. The Illuminati keep detailedrecords of who has the dormant DNA corruption. They have used genealogicallibraries like the one at the Illuminati-controlled Mormon Church in Salt LakeCity, Utah, to do this in the past, but the preferred method today is a globalDNA database that they are now manipulating into being under the guise ofstopping crime and terrorism. What happens to these unknowing “corruptioncarriers” is that they are targeted by the Illuminati in the knowledge of whothey are. They might be making a career in politics, the law, the military, themedia and so on, and they will find that their careers suddenly take off andsome powerful people begin to support them. At this stage they are under theimpression that this sponsorship by influential people is because of theirability or, in the case of politics, because the supporters believe in what thetarget stands for. But in truth it is because of their DNA. At some point thetarget is invited to join the secret society network as a good career move andthey are put through the rituals that activate the DNA corruption. Still theywill have no idea of what is going on, just as 99% of Freemasons have no ideawhat their bizarre initiation rituals really mean and are structured to achieve.Once the target’s DNA possession code is triggered by the rituals the process ofpossession by the inter-space entities begins to unfold. The person’s thoughts,emotions and attitudes begin to change until they are a fully possessed being.How many times do we hear former friends and colleagues of those in power saythat they are not the same people they once knew? We are led to believe thatthese changes of personality are due to the influences of power – “powercorrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. Of course, there is somevalidity in this, but the main reason for the personality change is quite simplythat are no longer the same being, let alone the same character.With this knowledge, the apparently complex, mysterious and contradictory beginsto come into clear focus. People think that Americans would not slaughterAmericans, for example, and government agencies could not have been involved inthe planning of 9/11. But the leaders are not American; they are reptilianentities possessing a “human body” that was born in America. It is the same withthe leaders in Britain, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Germany and all the rest.These “leaders” have no allegiance to the people of these nations, their onlyallegiance is to themselves as reptilians that have been manipulating this worldfor aeons to create a global centralised fascist state through which they cancontrol a micro-chipped, constantly monitored, population. Their allegiance isto a long-planned conspiracy to create a structure in which every child borninto this five-sense world is immediately micro-chipped and turned into anexternally manipulated and controlled battery to provide an energy source forthe inter-space entities that are running the show by occupying physical bodies.If you look at Figure 31 (overleaf) I have symbolised the structure of reptiliancontrol. The Illuminati manipulate their bloodlines (in other words theinter-space entities) into the positions of power across the world through theirsecret society web in each country. Most of these leaders in the variouscountries are working to the same goal and they only appear to be in conflictfor the purposes of deluding the people into a false reality. There is alsogreat rivalry on one level between different elements of the Illuminati becauseas one researcher told me years ago: “They are like a gang of bank robbers. Theyall agree on the job, but then argue about how the spoils are shared out”. Thosewho are so consumed by the desire for power and control are not going to switchthat off when it comes to having power over those on the same side. But they alldepend on the agenda for their collective power over humanity and that is thecement that holds the warring factions together. The reptilian leaders of thevarious countries play out a pre-arranged plan that appears to the public to bethe random result of random events. But in fact, as the Illuminati puppetFranklin Delano Roosevelt said: “Whatever happens in politics you can bet it wasmeant to happen.” The leaders of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,Russia, China etc., are not American, Arab, Pakistani, Russian, and Chineseexcept in their outer five-sense form. They are reptilian-possessed beingsworking to the same agenda. The interaction between them is just the movie. TheLi bloodline in China, for example, is one of the major Illuminati bloodlines onthe planet and this has been bred into other races over thousands of years tothe point where it does not manifest as a “Chinese” body, but still maintainsthe corrupted DNA. As I was writing this book, a fellow researcher contacted meto say that he had an excellent Chinese source that claimed to have seen theIlluminati Li family “tree” and saw that it connected to Bill Clinton and theBush family. The reptilian bloodlines do not relate to an earth race, they haveinfiltrated all races and cultures. These reptilian leaders manipulate “their”nations to fight with other nations to advance their collective agenda, but ofcourse they rarely if ever see a gun fired in anger. George W. Bush ordered aninvasion of Afghanistan, but he didn’t go there and fight, he sent pawns fromthe people. His father ordered the war against Iraq, but he didn’t go there andfight, he sent pawns from the people. The reptilian entities in the positions ofpower manipulate the peoples of the world to fight each other in the five-senseprison and in doing so advance their structure of global centralisation whileproducing vast quantities of fear to feed their own “world”. The human race hasbeen duped all this time and never more so than now. The conditioned realitythey are programmed to accept prevents them from seeing the malevolent game thatis being played out all around them. The idea of reptilian entities controllingtheir lives by hiding within human form is beyond most people’s comprehensionbecause it is so far from their conditioned sense of possibility. They havenever been told the vibrational truths or had access to the ancient and modernevidence and information that would tell them a very different version ofreality. Because of this, even when most people are presented with the truththey laugh in its face.image [../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 31: While those in power in different countries appear to be different“races” with an allegiance to their “nation”, they are mostlyreptilian-possessed entities working to the same goal – a global fascist state.Many of them may not like each other and there may be much infighting, but theiroverall agenda is the same. Operation infinite freedomWhat we call “life” on this planet – the “three score years and ten” between“birth” and “death” – is only a short experience within the five-sense frequencyrange. It is a short and challenging experience of the dense vibrations of thisfive-sense reality to allow our consciousness to look itself in the face. Thebody is the five-sense vehicle for our consciousness to do that. Unfortunatelythis “world” has become so manipulated that humans now identify who they are andwhat they can do by the nature of their physical bodies. Racism is just oneexpression of this ludicrous misunderstanding. It is like an astronaut judgingwho and what he is by the nature of his space suit. We would think that wasstupid. “You are not your spacesuit”, we would say, “you are what is inside yourspacesuit”. Exactly. But that’s how most humans judge themselves and the worldevery single waking second. I have a body, therefore I am. Is my body black,white, yellow, brown, male, female, fit, fat, tall, small, old, bald, souped upor fucked up? These are judgements we make about ourselves and others inrelation to who we are, and who and what other people are. These judgements areadded to those made on the basis of what we do for a “living” and how much moneyor fame we may or may not have. If you observe the world, those two criteria –the body and the bank balance – are the foundations on which most people judgethemselves and others in terms of success and failure. You can have a fat bodyand lots of money, and the money tips the balance when the judgements are made.You are successful. But if you are fat and broke, wow, what a friggin’ failure.If you are broke and beautiful, then beauty tips the balance when the judgementsare made. He’s got no money, but he’s gorgeous. If you are beautiful and wealthyyou’ve hit the jackpot and the paparazzi will follow your every move so thefailures can see what they’re missing. All the time we are judging success inthese ways, and the Illuminati love that and have worked so hard to achieve it.The more we make judgements on success and failure based on five-sense reality –beauty and the bank – the more we become entranced by the illusions anddelusions of this “world”. We become trapped in the web and forget who we are –infinite consciousness having a physical experience. That’s the last thing theIlluminati want us to know and they have created a society based on stimulatingthe five senses, making them objects of addiction and worship, and suppressingthe connections between our incarnate self and our infinite self: the ocean. AsJohn Lennon used to sing:> Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV.> And you think you’re so clever and classless and free.> But you’re still fucking peasants as far as I can see.We face a daily onslaught of stimulation and manipulation of the five senses tokeep us imprisoned in five-sense reality and to hold the focus of ourconsciousness and perception at that level of our infinite self. They want tokeep us in the eggshell, or the egg cell. “Would you like to open your mind toinfinite possibility?” “No thanks, I’d rather have me dick rubbed.” Foodadditives, vaccines and the explosion of chemicals that are consumed every dayas “food”, “drink” and “medicine” are also designed to disconnect the pathwaysfrom five-sense reality to infinite self. So are the wars, conflicts, terroristoutrages and financial manipulations. They want us so focused on power andsurvival (reptilian brain) and fear in all its forms that we never even considerthe basic questions of life: who are we and what the hell are we doing here?“Look mate, I can’t think about all that stuff, I have a living to earn and afamily to feed.” “Look mate, I can’t think about all that stuff, I have a careerto build.” Hello? Knock, knock, anyone in there? You are infinite consciousnessand you are in control of your reality whenever you choose to be. You can livelife or, like most people, let life live you. It’s your call. Do you wantsuppression and control, or infinite freedom? You have the power to choose anddon’t let anyone kid you otherwise.What is reality? Whatever you want it to beIf you sit in a room with a group of people and you all choose to attack andcondemn each other you will have a deeply unpleasant experience and so willthey. The responsibility for that experience is not down to some outside force.It is you and the others choosing to attack and condemn each other. You willhave created your own reality and while you may blame this person or that personfor “starting it”, the truth is that you are all responsible for what happenedbecause you all took part. This is what is happening to the human racecollectively every day. We are all responsible for what is happening in theworld and in our lives, but we blame each other for it. That same group ofpeople could sit in that same room and make a different choice, so creating adifferent reality. They could love each other, be nice to each other, andrespect everyone’s different opinion. In doing so they would create a pleasantexperience, a pleasant reality. We are in control of what we experience. Thedifference between the “world” being a prison or a paradise is merely thechoices we make. The world we see though our eyes in people, places and events,is just a mirror of our inner self. The “outer” world we see is the reflectionof the “inner” self that we don’t see and don’t wish to acknowledge isresponsible. Change that and we change the reflection in the mirror – our lives,the “world”. If we don’t change ourselves the reflection can’t change no matterhow much we may cuss and blame, pass “laws” and thrash around in five-sensereality. Stage one, the first step in bringing down the vibrational walls builtby the Illuminati, is to start, from this moment, to take responsibility forwhat is happening in our lives and the world in general. The Illuminati may bethe driving force behind the global fascist state, but we are just asresponsible if we sit on our arses and let them do it. I am not advocating massprotest or stockpiling weapons. That approach cannot change anything because itis operating on the same vibrational level as the Illuminati – five-sensereality – and they are experts at controlling those realms of perception. Youshoot at them with a rifle, they’ll shoot at you with a tank. You mass protestat their meetings and they’ll put agents provocateurs in the crowd to justifysending in the helmets to knock the living shit out of you. If we try to changefive-sense reality with the weapons and illusions of five-sense reality we arejust adding still further to the control of perception by five-sense reality.Round and round and round we go in an ever-descending spiral, deeper and deeperinto five-sense illusion. We are bigger than that.Five-sense reality, the Illuminati’s home ground, is an energy field, a denseenergy field, currently ablaze with low-vibrational disharmony and chaos. Theevents of 9/11, and those that have followed, have added massively to that,exactly as planned. Symbolically we are living our daily lives in a raging seaof energy, whipped up into vast hurricanes, whirlwinds, and waves by the fear,anger, frustration, and hatred that, second by second, spew from humanconsciousness across the world. Each one has its own disharmonious wavelengthand the sum total has created the reality we experience – disharmony. Imaginetrying to think straight if you were stood in a raging torrent, and you wereusing all your strength just to remain standing and survive. That is what ourminds and emotions are coping with every minute as we move through the energyfield of planet earth – the violent, turbulent sea of energy that human thoughthas manifested, and the Illuminati has constantly encouraged and manipulated.This makes it almost impossible for most people to hold a connection with theirinfinite self on the other side of this turbulence, and generates the very fearand disharmony that feeds the reptilians and other entities in the inter-spaceplane. To turn machine guns on the Illuminati and to hurl bile and hatred atthem would not change anything. It would just add to the disharmony thatdisconnects and imprisons us. There is another way. When faced with a problemyou can either find a “solution” or remove the cause. Solutions are usually notsolutions at all and lead only to more problems. For instance, going to waragainst the Illuminati might be seen as a “solution”, but all it does is createanother war, more death, conflict and disharmony, and the world would be in aworse state than it was before. It is the same with our health. Stress-relatedillness is treated with pills that use chemicals to target the symptoms of thestress. These cause other chemical reactions in the body – known as“side-effects” – and another chain reaction of consequences begins. The only wayto cure stress-related illness is to remove the cause of the stress. The matureand sensible way to remove a problem is to remove the cause. When you observethe problems of the world, you are not, in general, looking at causes, butsymptoms. Starving children in a world of plenty is not a cause, it’s a symptom.War is the same and all the other problems we so wish would be no more. Theircauses, I would suggest, are the following:> 1.We have given our power and responsibility away (same thing) and so allowed> a few to dictate events in the world.> 2.We have made judgements based on “What’s in it for me, how does this affect> me?” rather than “What is the right and decent thing to do?”> 3.Most people have become so entranced by the addictions of the five senses> that they can perceive no other reality and judge all possibility by the world> that we see, hear, touch, taste and smell.> 4.We have, as a result, become disconnected from our infinite self, the ocean> of love, wisdom and knowing that is waiting to rejoin us whenever we choose to> broadcast the invitation.> 5.We have become mesmerised by five-sense reality and allowed the Illuminati’s> manipulated wars and divisions to cause us to project the wavelengths and> vibrations of so much fear, conflict, hatred and disharmony that we have> turned the energy field in which we live into a raging torrent of chaotic and> conflicting energy. This holds us in five-sense disconnection.What’s the answer? We love ourselves and we love each other.From that will come all things. When we love ourselves and respect ourselves forwhat we are, infinite consciousness having a physical experience, our wholesense of perspective changes. The irrelevant details and petty conflicts, fearsand frustrations of five-sense reality become meaningless to a spirit that knowsit is all that exists. There is no we, just one infinite “I”. We are not part of“God”, together we are “God”. Now, still worried about the price of beer or whatthe boss thinks of you? Still concerned about getting that promotion or what the“future” might bring? You are the beer; you are the boss; you are everyone inevery job; you are the “future”; the “past”; the “present”; the infinite Now;you are all that is, ever has been or ever will be. Yeah, you sweeping thestreets and picking up the garbage, you considered a “failure” by conditionedminds – you, too. Yes, and George Bush, father and son; and Cheney, Powell,Kissinger, Blair and all the rest of them. They are “God” also. They are justobserving reality from a different place and a different perspective, onedominated by fear and the survival mentality. Their desire to control everythingand everyone is founded on that very survival instinct: “If I controleverything, I will control my survival.” Relax guys; you will survive becauseconsciousness cannot be destroyed, only transformed into another state. TheIlluminati need to be loved more than any of us, and to change this world from aprison to a paradise we need to love them as much as we need to love ourselves.Indeed by loving ourselves, we are loving them and vice versa.I can hear the macho men with the surplus-store uniforms and the gun-showweaponry screaming from here. “Fucking love ’em? You New Age wanker. We need toblow their fucking asses into the fires of fucking hell.” Mmmm. That’ll make ita better world; I’ll look forward to that with those guys in charge. On secondthoughts, when does the next spaceship leave for a faraway galaxy? Get me aticket, quick. It is not the physical body in the positions of power thatmatters, except to the Illuminati, it is the consciousness that is deciding itsbehaviour. Minds controlled by the belief in some angry, vicious, fire andbrimstone “God” are actually the same mentality as the Illuminati they say theyoppose. The only difference is how they manifest that mentality. The Christiangun-toters are also full of fear, and also express the survival mentality.That’s why they stockpile guns, food and water for when their version ofArmageddon comes. They say they believe in freedom, but listen for long enoughand that’s the last thing they want. They don’t want freedom for all, they wantthe freedom to replace a system of control that they don’t like with a system ofcontrol that they do – theirs. They want to replace rule by the Illuminati withrule by the conflicting “laws” of a book that out-contradicts and out-fairytaleseven the official story of 9/11. That’s not freedom, that’s just another prison.The fact is, I would suggest, that most people who talk about freedom don’t wantthat in truth. They couldn’t cope with its responsibilities and the thought thatthe days of imposing their will and beliefs on others, including their children,were over. Freedom is to freely express your uniqueness while respecting thefreedom of others to do the same. “Are you saying people should be free to killeach other then?”, I hear the sceptics cry. Of course not. How can youdisrespect another’s freedom more than to destroy their ability to freelyexperience this world by taking their means to do so away from them? Freedom ofself and respect for the freedom of others are one and the same. Withoutrespecting another’s right to freedom we cannot be free. This is why to look theother way at the treatment of people at Guantanamo Bay and in the exploitedlands of Africa, South America, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere, is to denyour own right to be free. While one person on this planet is not truly free toexpress his or her uniqueness of thought, view, and lifestyle, none of us can betruly free. How come? Because they are us and we are them. We are each other.When we love ourselves and love all things the causes of our plight in thisfive-sense reality will disappear without a gun being fired. This is why:> 1.When you love yourself and respect yourself you will never give away to> anyone your power and responsibility to perceive and act. You will not be told> what to do and what to think.> 2.When you love and respect all things, you will not make judgements based on> “How does this affect me?”, but only on the basis of what you believe to be> right.> 3.When you open your heart to love of self and all things, you immediately> connect with the infinite ocean that is also love. If you express the> vibration, the frequency of love, in its true, unconditional sense, you must> connect with that same frequency out in the infinite, beyond the five-sense> illusion. The infinite will then become your point of observation, and not> five-sense reality. You will be in this “world” physically, but your> consciousness will not be of it. Addiction over.> 4.When you express love for self and others you no longer project the> disharmonious, chaotic vibrations, of fear, conflict, hatred and aggression,> and instead broadcast harmony – love – into the raging sea around us. We> become the vehicle to bring love out of the infinite and into the energy field> of five-sense reality. When we do so, and more and more do the same, we> transform the chaos into harmony, the raging sea into a pool of tranquillity.> As this process begins to unfold it becomes easier and easier for incarnate> consciousness in five-sense reality to reconnect with infinite self as the> chaotic vibrations around us subside and allow the connection with the> infinite to be received unpolluted once again.With people thinking for themselves and taking responsibility for their thoughtsand actions; with people doing what they believe to be right without thinking ofthe consequences for themselves; with people reconnecting with infinite self anddisconnecting from the illusions of five-sense reality; with people living in aharmonious energy field that is not constantly undermining their mental andemotional state; with all of these things, all manifesting from love, theIlluminati game will be over, their energy source will be gone, and they willhave to wake up and move forward in their infinite journey also. The prison willbe a paradise.Love is the answer.Love is seen by so many as a weakness when it is the ultimate power. Love in itstrue expression is without fear. Love does not lie down in the face of threatsand fear of the consequences; it always does what it believes to be right. Itknows there are no consequences, only infinite experience. Enlightened peoplefor thousands of years have talked of “thinking” from the heart. This is not thephysical heart, but the spiritual one, the heart vortex, or “chakra”, in thecentre of the chest that connects us from the five-sense frequencies through tothe infinite ocean of love. You know where it is because when you feel lovethat’s where you feel the physical and emotional sensation. The symbol of thephysical heart became associated with love when this truth was lost. Throughthis same vortex point comes our inspiration and intuition because that alsooriginates at higher levels of ourselves, out in the infinite.What changed my life in the late 1980s/early 1990s was when I decided that if myhead and intuition (heart) were ever in conflict I would always go with theintuition. It can appear to get you into trouble in the short term and the headscreams “I told you so – see what happens when you don’t listen to me?” Butstick with it and wonders manifest. Eventually the head observes this andrealises that following your heart is the way. At that point what you think andwhat you feel become the same, and the internal war between thoughts andfeelings that ravages the lives of so many comes to an end. The Illuminati wantus to close our hearts and they work constantly to make this happen. They knowthat when we close our heart vortex, our connection with the infinite alsocloses. They want us to be dominated by the five-sense head, not the infiniteheart. A physicist friend told me that the ingredients of some vaccines affectthe para-thyroid gland in the throat in a way that suppresses the connectionbetween the heart vortex and the throat vortex through which we communicate withlanguage. Communication then becomes dominated by the flow of thought from thefive-sense brain and lower mind. I know this may sound far-fetched to many, butthis is the level of detail to which the Illuminati go to hold us in five-sensereality. More than that, they have to go to these levels of detail because beingimprisoned by the five-senses is not our natural state. Humans are like a ballin a tank of water – its natural place is floating on the top. If you want tochange that you have to hold the ball on the bottom of the tank and keep holdingit there. The moment you let go, whoosh, it’s floating on the top again. Ournatural state is multidimensional connection and so the Illuminati have to workconstantly to hold us in disconnection through an onslaught of mental,emotional, and physical means – mind manipulation, stress and fear, and foodadditives, vaccines, etc. But all of these are useless if we “think” and feelfrom the heart and view the world from that perspective. It overrides allattempts to disconnect us and we make very different decisions to those dictatedfrom the conditioned, five-sense head. Love is the answer. It always has been,is, and ever will be.I love you George BushAny other “solution” is avoiding the point and kidding ourselves that theanswers and the blame lie “out there”. The human race as a whole is asresponsible for 9/11 in its own way as those who actually did it. For if peoplehad made different choices earlier and had not given away their minds andresponsibility, it would never have happened. While we go on cooperating withour own imprisonment there will be more manufactured outrages until we decide towake up and grow up, and start manifesting the true infinite magnitude of whoand what we really are. I have exposed the actions of those in power in relationto September 11th and so many other horrors, but to focus all responsibility onthose people is to deny our own. Despite appearances, the aim of this book hasnot been to apportion blame, either to the Illuminati or the human race ingeneral. It may appear to be about that in the earlier chapters as I detailedthe events of 9/11 from the perspective of five-sense reality and it isimportant that those directly responsible are identified or these horrors willgo on. But as I have indicated from the start, that is only one level ofobserving that day and its aftermath. The one highlighted in this chapter is farmore relevant, I would suggest, because it offers a way home, a way to turn backfrom the vibrational abyss. This book is primarily about offering another visionof reality and possibility, not apportioning blame; for blame is a five-senseperspective. From this higher point of observation, those responsible for 9/11are not to “blame” any more than humanity’s dereliction of responsibility is to“blame”. These were choices that led to consequences and those consequences canlead to learning and enlightenment if only we choose to observe from that levelof maturity. But will we? Some 3,000 dead civilians in America are met by atleast 5,000 dead civilians in Afghanistan. How the hell does that move the worldon? On that basis, only when we are all “dead” and the world is a wasteland,will we have peace. What nonsense, what utter bollocks. As Gandhi said: “An eyefor an eye makes the whole world blind.” In the same way, the answer to theIlluminati is not to blow them away or inflict the “justice” of capitalpunishment because that will only add to the mental state that leads them tocontinue the manipulation of this reality to feed their own desperation to“survive”. Yes, they need to be removed from the positions of power andprevented from continuing their genocide, but until they can see the nonsense oftheir actions, not least for the effect on themselves, they will continue inwhat we call the future to manipulate this “world” by taking over other“bodies”. At some point we have to talk.The only way to dismantle the Illuminati web of control is to think and feel itout of existence – to love it into a higher state of reality, beyond survivaland into the infinite. As scientist and philosopher Buckminster Fuller put it:“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something,build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” When the Illuminatilet go of the fear of survival they will see what they have been missing andthey will be seriously pissed off to realise how long they have been missing it.So I say to them, I am not a threat to your survival. No one is. You areinfinite consciousness that has nothing and no one to survive. I love you GeorgeBush, father and son; I love you Cheney and Powell and Kissinger and Carlucciand the Illuminati High Council and the reptilian hierarchy in the inter-spaceplane. I love you. If I don’t love you I don’t love myself. Everything iseverything and so if I don’t love you I can’t love myself. This is a verydifferent perspective to the one you have read throughout most of this book, butboth perspectives are true. They are just different levels of looking at thesame events. September 11th was a terrible day, one of endless such days on thisplanet over thousands of years. But the greatest opportunities are oftenbrilliantly disguised as your worst nightmare. This one has presented anopportunity to wake up and see beyond the illusion. September 11th can add tothe nightmare or it can help to free us from it.Many people across the planet, far more than the Illuminati could have believed,are not buying the fairytale and they are asking questions about what happenedthat day and what is happening in the world in general. More and more are goingthrough this process of awakening to a new reality and amid the apparentdarkness the light is beginning to shine. This book is the end of an era for meand the start of a new one. I think we have enough publications now about theconspiracy from the five-sense perspective. My books on these subjects alone runto thousands of pages and in them and other works there is enough informationabout the names, dates, places and techniques of manipulation. It is importantto know these facts to be streetwise within five-sense reality, but that’s onlyone level of the game. Changing reality from “I can’t” to “I am”, from smallhorizon to no horizon, is where my journey takes me now. From exposing theconspiracy, to thinking and feeling it out of existence. As the Morpheuscharacter says in the movie, The Matrix: “You have to let it all go, Neo; fear,doubt, disbelief. Free your mind.”If you remember only one thing from this book, I would rather it not be aboutNORAD or Bush or Mohamed Atta. I would prefer it to be simply this. You havecreated your “life” and we have created the “world” we collectively experience.That means we can change it anytime we want. It’s a just choice right nowbetween fear and love. You are not your body or your family or your job or yourreligion or your bank balance. You are all that has been, is, or ever will be.You are all love, all hate, all fear, all freedom. You are everyone andeverything.Don’t think you are. Know you are.SOURCES > 1Guylaine Lanctot, The Medical Mafia and What The Hell Are We Doing Here> Anyway?
