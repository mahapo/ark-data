When Digital Angel publicly began to promote their human implantable chip, Christians the world over gasped in excitement that an implantable chip was http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (1 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 now on the world scene, being promoted for all the medical, financial, and personal benefits it could provide the human host. When Digital Angel went public on Wall Street, and when they began to get large orders, we all felt that the prophetic time table was moving ever faster forward. However, behind the scene and very quietly, that superscret DARPA \"Anti- terrorist\" organization headed by Admiral John Poindexter began to pump significant dollars of research behind a new implantable chip called MMEA , Multiple Micro Electrode Array. This chip is so far ahead of the Digital Angel Veri-Chip product, it took my breath away. Once you fully understand its capability, you will realize its probable full prophetic significance, and will realize that we may have probably been pointed to Digital Angel simply so we would not be aware of MMEA. We shall present this information in a four-part series, as follows: Part 1 -- The Science of MMEA and of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) Part 2 -- DARPA Funding Part 3 -- Possible Prophecy Implications -- Blending religion with science, spiritual applications already being discussed Part 4 -- MMEA - Is The Mark of the Beast Just Another \"Satanic Insert\" So Commonly Used In Covens For Centuries? DEFINITION OF TERMS Always, when discussing a matter that is both complex and ill-understood by the reader, we need to properly identify key terms. There are two key terms we must properly and clearly understand if we are to comprehend the importance of this implantable chip coming upon mankind at this point in history. These two terms are: * BMI - Brain Machine Interface : Technically, this term defines the project on which scientists are working, or the type of Hardware and Software used to connect the Brain or Nervous system to a computer. Please understand that this chip is designed to work within the nerves and soft tissue of the body in order to gather electrical signals from the body and/or transmit electrical signals received from the outside to the body through the nerves! Brain Machine Interface is simply the computer software that will send out the signal to the chip; therefore, BMI is the software that will interact with the chip, to control the chip and the person in whom the chip is inserted! * MMEA , Multiple Micro Electrode Array : Multiple Micro Electrode Array, this is the actual Chip. This chip will be surgically implanted directly into a human nerve or into specific area of the brain . The Chip at the moment is a little smaller than a Tic Tac breath mint. The chip implanted into the pioneer, a Professor Kevin Warwick, had 100 Electrodes; each electrode looks like a small needle and is capable of detecting electric signals traveling through the nervous system and also sending electrical signals to the nervous system, this was http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (2 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 all performed via a RF (Radio Frequency) device connected to the MMEA . As you can see already, this implantable chip is far ahead of anything Digital Angel has on the market; further, MMEA is light-years ahead of the RFID technology which retailers like Wal-Mart are racing into production. As we unfold the science of this chip, you will see that it offers a repressive global government the capability of controlling entire captive populations with a sophisticated software program! You will clearly see how an entire population of the earth might actually fulfill these prophetic verses: \"... the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration.\" [Revelation 13:3; Parallel Bible, KJV/Amplified Bible Commentary] \"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\" [Rev 13:16-17] Recording From Biological Tissue \"The essential requirements for a working multiple-microelectrode to record from biological tissue include: 1. A conductor forming the active electrode and the tracks, e.g. indium-tin oxide (ITO), titanium nitride; 2. An electrical insulation layer, e.g. polysiloxane, polyimide, or silicon nitride; 3. The microelectrode must be biocompatible, resistant to a physiological saline environment and sterilisation, and easily maintained in cell culture conditions for many days or weeks.\"[ Neuronal Networks Electrophysiology Laboratory , School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham Medical School] Carefully contemplate the basic requirement listed above for an MMEA: \"to record from biological tissue\" One of the fundamental goals of the MMEA is to intercept and record electrical impulses from biological tissue. Currently, extensive tests are being carried out on human subjects to discover the exact electrical frequency of a wide variety of human emotions, feelings, and various mechanical actions. Each different emotion and/or feeling has a slightly different radio frequency! Therefore, by intercepting and recording the exact frequency of each emotion and/or feeling from their human test subjects, the exact frequency of each feeling can be identified and then stored into the BMI -- Brain Machine Interface software! At some future point, a person may be sent a signal from an RF transmitter that will give that person pleasure or pain, with the exact frequency coming from the BMI software! Or, the exact frequency of various mechanical orders the brain is continuously giving the muscles can be recorded and stored in the Brain Machine Interface Software; this type of software capability seems to have great promise for people suffering neural damage that prevents them from walking, for example. How scientists plan on doing this in theory is very simple. A person's body functions by small amounts of electrical energy sent in patterns that determines what a person wants to do, operating much like the Binary Code of a Personal Computer. The Brain acts a processor, sending electrical signals in proper sequence throughout the nervous system to tell the specific parts of our body what to do. These signals also travel back to our brains to tell us what we Feel, See, Hear and Smell. If we have a device implanted into a specific area of our nervous system which has the ability to detect these electrical patterns and then transmit to a computer with http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (3 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 special software to record and analyze this data, we can, for example, determine what types of electrical patterns make us move our leg up or down. If this data was transferred to a central computer for analyzing and storage then it could be transferred back to the nervous system. This data from one person can even be transmitted to another person, or to many other persons, making them move their leg up or down, or making them feel a great variety of emotions and feelings, and/or do a variety of actions that the controller wants them to do. Instilling Thoughts In A Person's Brain NEWS BRIEF: \"Defense Department funding brain-machine work\", Tuesday, August 5, 2003, BY GARETH COOK, The Boston Globe, reprinted in The Post and Courier, Chareleston.net, http://www.charleston.net/ stories/080503/wor_05darpa.shtml \"What most people don't know is that the Department of Defense is already funding a research program with far creepier implications. The $24 million enterprise called Brain Machine Interfaces is developing technology that promises to directly read thoughts from a living brain -- and even instill thoughts as well. The research, some of which is being done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is already surprisingly advanced. Monkeys in a laboratory can control the movement of a robotic arm using only their thoughts. And last year scientists in New York announced they could control the skittering motions of a rat by implanting electrodes in its brain, steering it around the lab floor as if it were a radio-controlled toy car.\" \"It does not take much imagination to see in this the makings of a 'Matrix'-like cyberpunk dystopia: chips that impose false memories, machines that scan for wayward thoughts, cognitively augmented government security forces that impose a ruthless order on a recalcitrant population. It is one thing to propose a tasteless market for gambling on terrorism. It is quite another to set some of the nation's top neuroscientists to work on mind control.\" As you can see, this research is getting to be quite advanced. However, we must not lose sight of the original brains behind this technology -- Professor Kevin Warwick -- and how he and his wife are currently conducting very specific research. Brief Bio of The Professor The leading scientist in this entire field is Professor Kevin Warwick: \"Professor of Cybernetics at the University of Reading, UK where he carries out research in artificial intelligence, control and robotics. Kevin has published over 300 research papers and his latest paperback In the Mind of the Machines gives a warning of a future in which machines are more intelligent than humans ... In 1998 he shocked the international scientific community by having a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his left arm. A series of further implant experiments have taken place in which Kevin’s nervous system was linked to a computer ... Kevin's new implant experiment called 'Project Cyborg' got underway in March 2002 and is providing exciting results.\" [ http://www.kevinwarwick.com/] The In/Out Principle NEWS BRIEF: \"Brain-Machine Interfaces: Current and Future Applications\", CHI Labs, , http://personal.bgsu. edu/~nberg/chilabs/bmi.htm \"The purpose of Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) research is to create outputs from or inputs to http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (4 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 the brain that are additional to those that occur naturally. There are two possible directions of data flow (data from the brain to outside machinery and data to the brain from outside machinery). In whole, this research suggests that the brain is a much more adaptable organ than it is commonly thought to be.\" Did you catch the extremely important phrase? \"create outputs from or inputs to the brain that are additional to those that occur naturally \". In computer language, if there is a way out then there is a way in. Kevin Warwick has already started work on this principle in experiments with his wife; there is nothing mysterious here about their manner of exchanging feelings. Basically, what is happening is simply understood; the electrical signals that are detected by the MMEA in one person -- Kevin, for example, touching his arm -- are transferred via RF from the Chips transceiver to a RF receiver. This sends the signal to a remote computer for analysis and storage. Then, if the command is given, the data can be forwarded to another person -- his wife in this current round of experiments -- who will have the same MMEA Chip with I/O capability and an RF link. This chip will then be told by the RF signal to send the same patterns of electrical signals to the nerve via the electrodes which should in theory reproduce the same action and or feeling that was originally performed and felt by Kevin. In other words, if Keven touches his arm, his wife should feel a touching sensation in her arm, in the same place and to the same degree that Kevin felt it when he touched his arm. Theoretically, Kevin could touch his arm in London and his wife could feel a touch in her arm in the same place and to the same degree, even if she were in New York City! Now, if this device will allow that type of activity, then the possibilities are many, if not endless. For example, Kevin has the idea that pain such as the type that comes from headaches have a specific electrical signal; we could manipulate the nervous system to where we would no longer feel headaches. By altering the electric current, we could also sedate people or reduce the affects of stress by recording our emotional feelings on days that we are happy and simply replay them on days we are feeling depressed. This is just the beginning of possibilities that are being discussed. If there is the possibility of manipulating people's mental and physical feelings and actions, this MMEA tool would have many practical uses by the medical community, by the individual, but most of all, by the government. Imagine having the ability to direct much needed medicines via this technology to a tumor deep in the brain and have these medicines eradicate a once-fatal condition. Scientists at the University of Michigan are working on, this very possibility right now. But, we must also seriously consider the huge potential for tight control over entire populations! It may be possible to sedate an entire population, or to make them think the same thoughts at the same time! Can you imagine this kind of weapon in the hands of the Illuminati, as they press toward their goal of tightly controlling the whole world? The Wireless Cloud Experiment What government wouldn't want the ability to tranquilize a entire city during a Riot, or better yet keep all of its citizens content or happy by continually feeding them prerecorded emotions! Imagine how small Police Forces might become if we could be controlled in this manner. Imagine how thrilled tyrants like Adolf Hitler , Josef Stalin, or Saddam Hussein would have been had they had devices like this, which could control the feelings http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (5 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 and emotions of entire populations! Our government evidently understands the potential of control over entire populations, as evidenced by their recent \"Wireless Cloud Experiment\"! NEWS BRIEF: \"How can people tap into a wireless 'cloud'?\", By Marsha Walton, CNN Sci-Tech, July 31, 2002. \"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- Applications for a wireless \"cloud\" may not seem obvious at first, but organizers of the high-tech project in Athens, Georgia, say there are many ways in which it can be used. The University of Georgia has joined with local government to create WAG, the Wireless Athens Group. They're building a cloud over several blocks of the downtown area where anyone with the right equipment can have free Internet access. The cloud now covers about three blocks, and it will soon expand to 24. CNN's Marsha Walton looks into how users can tap into it. * Sports -- University of Georgia students already have successfully tested some options ... They used wireless technology to provide instant replays on personal digital assistants (PDAs) at a recent college baseball game. for the really devoted (or lazy) fan, students have come up with a prototype for this possibility: Beam your beer and snack order directly to a computer at the concession stand, punch in your seat number, and the food will be delivered. You never have to miss a pitch, a hit, or an argument with the umpire. * Music -- On any given night in this college town, 40 bands might be taking the stage at local bars and coffee houses. For a student unfamiliar with most of the performers, and unwilling to part with a $3 cover charge for music he or she doesn't like, the wireless \"cloud\" could provide a chance to sample a song or two from some of these bands. * Retail -- People walking out of class or an office and in a rush for lunch could pull up a menu from a local restaurant, place an order, even pay online via their PDA. By the time they walked a few blocks to the cafe, their food would be ready to go. * World market -- A wireless cloud in central or south America could empower people who have little access to telecommunications infrastructure now ... (customers will) be able to communicate at a very cheap rate.\" However, this technology has a very dark lining. This same \"Wireless Cloud\" hovering over a city can also communicate with, and control, MMEA chips implanted in people! Conceivably, RF transmissions from this cloud could cause everyone in whom this chip is implanted to feel euphoria, depression, or any other emotion at the same time, totally at the will of the people controlling the BMI software. If the controllers wanted to sedate the entire population, they could easily do so. If they wanted to implant thoughts in the minds of the people, they conceivably can implant them. Therefore, when New Age writings say that thoughts will be implanted in people's minds when \"The Christ\" arises, is this the technology which will produce those implanted thoughts? Cheap Technology Even Third World Nations Can Deploy The Reason that wireless transmission is so cheap is that there is very little hardware to install. All the hardware that is needed is a telecom link to a city; this can be done via Satellite or Land Line Links. From this, all you need to install is an RF transmitter and receiver on the tallest building in the City. Anyone with the http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (6 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 proper RF equipment would have constant internet access. Most remote locations in the Third World are all currently running via RF and Satellite uplinks; in most of these areas, existing phone lines are turn-of-the Century Era Pulse. There are no Coin Digital Lines in many of these places, so most people are using RF in some form for internet access and mobile phones for voice communication; it is very doubtful they will ever run land lines again. In this manner, Third World Nations seem further along in this particular area than people in more advanced nations. RF is becoming popular world-wide, and it won't be much longer before we see it more and more in day-to-day use throughout the entire world. Future Uses of the Social security Number and RF BMI Before any person who wants to use this implantable MMEA chip in such a manner that they can communicate via RF over the Internet, each MMEA chip must contain a unique I.P. Address , especially if its intention is data transfer and receiving. The person programming the MMEA chip for an individual would only need to know that person's Social Security number; they could then program this number in as an IP Address ; they could even add that person's birthday as a gateway address. At this juncture, I remembered an understanding given a Methodist minister in 1798 that may have great bearing on this issue of an IP address . Listen: \"In 1798, a Methodist Minister, Adam Clarke, wrote: 'The Mark of the Beast will be an 18-digit number, 6+6+6' (Adam Clarke Unabridged Bible Commentary; as quoted in \"The New Money System: When Your Money Fails\" , by Mary Stewart, Ph.D., 1983, p. 152). Interestingly, this concept is being implemented by the European Union, planning to use it on every person in the world! Listen: http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875.cfm (7 of 9)12/15/2003 6:20:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DARPA IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR M...E IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18. Part 1 of 4 \"In 1977, Dr. Hanrick Eldeman, Chief Analyst for the European Economic Community, announced that he was ready to begin assigning a number to every person in the world; and that he plans to use a three six-digit unit, 18 Numbers.\" [Ibid.] Is the ultimate personal IP Address -- implanted in an MMEA chip in every person on earth -- going to be this 18-digit number? In the occult, the number '18' is a hidden \"666\", because '6+6+6 = 18'. Isn't it interesting that each American citizen is currently given a 9-digit Social Security Number, plus a 9-digit Zip Code? Have Americans already been assigned our '18-digit IP Address \"? Imagine the up-to-date statistics the government would have also at any given time. They would know how many people of a certain age group are alive without even having to go any extra effort. This chip would again make law enforcement a \"piece of cake\" as officers could know at any time, day or night, where a person was located because of RF Positioning software plugged into the 18-digit IP Address . The average person would consider all this loss of privacy to be only be a small inconvenience compared to all of the Medical and Personal benefits of the BMI Chips. Because of the inferior education people have received since World War II, the average citizen will not realize that a loss of individual privacy equals the loss of individual freedoms. Since the inherent heart of man is terribly wicked (Jeremiah 17:9), rulers in charge of governments at the time this technology is in place will not take long to begin to scheme how to use this second-by-second knowledge of every citizen's whereabouts as the means by which to enslave them. In fact, rulers in charge when this technology was beginning to be developed will immediately begin to scheme as to how they can manipulate their citizenry to where they can take their freedoms away, and then use this technology to keep them enslaved. To work this plan to perfection, rulers need to make their plans as the technology is maturing, while keeping their citizenry ignorant as to the ultimate role the technology will play in enslaving them. The people will only be told how \"beneficial\" this new technology will be and how it will enhance their life. This fact is the reason it is so important that D.A.R.P.A. is heavily funding this MMEA project! D.A.R.P.A . is part of Homeland Security, the agency taking the lead in fomenting fear of the global terrorist threat that is planned to sow the chaos and terror, out of which the order of the New World Order -- Kingdom of Antichrist -- can be established. The fact they are funding MMEA research shows the ultimate end for which this implantable chip is planned! We shall fully cover D.A.R.P.A. funding in Part 2 of this series. Our Founding Fathers knew that personal privacy was critical to maintaining freedoms; therefore, they placed a high degree of emphasis on privacy in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Today, using the manufactured threat of global terrorism as an excuse, President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have demanded, and have received, the most dictatorial authority imaginable, authority which allows government to take away our rights to privacy. Once this new authority is coupled with this new RF technology using the MMEA chip, the absolute, effective repression of an entire people is very possible. In fact, this is the New World Order Plan! Are you spiritually ready? Is your family? Are you adequately protecting your loved ones? This is the reason for this ministry, to enable you to first understand the peril facing you, and then help you develop strategies to warn and protect your loved ones. Once you have been thoroughly trained, you can also use your knowledge as a means to open the door of discussion with an unsaved person. I have been able to use it many times, and have seen people come to Jesus Christ as a result.

If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, but have been very lukewarm in your spiritual walk with Him, you need to immediately ask Him for forgiveness and for renewal. He will instantly forgive you, and fill your heart with the joy of the Holy Spirit. Then, you need to begin a daily walk of prayer and personal Bible Study. If you have never accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, but have come to realize His reality and the approaching End of the Age, and want to accept His FREE Gift of Eternal Life, you can also do so now, in the privacy of your home. Once you accept Him as Savior, you are spiritually Born Again, and are as assured of Heaven as if you were already there. Then, you can rest assured that the Kingdom of Antichrist will not touch you spiritually. If you would like to become Born Again, turn to our Salvation Page now. We hope you have been blessed by this ministry, which seeks to educate and warn people, so that they can see the coming New World Order -- Kingdom of Antichrist -- in their daily news.
