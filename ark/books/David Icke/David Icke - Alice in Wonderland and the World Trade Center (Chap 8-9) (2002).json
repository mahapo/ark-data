[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"House of cards \"Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th.\" George W. Bush T he official story of what happened on that horrific day in the autumn of 2001 is an obvious and transparent fantasy, and the atrocities of September 11th were yet another version of Oklahoma and Pearl Harbor. All of these attacks (and so, so, many more) were not only made to happen they were allowed to happen and this is the combination you see in all these Illuminati stings. They arrange for their agents in government, the intelligence network, the military, and terrorist groups to execute the plan. At the same time they ensure that the plan is allowed to happened through lax security, and that those who are truly responsible are never named, let alone caught. Ideally you want both the execution of the plan and the \"failed security\" to involve the same organisation because that provides optimum efficiency and potential for cover-up. So, often, you find that the perpetrators and those protecting the perpetrators are actually the same people. The evidence is clear that the attacks of September 11th were allowed to happen. Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty spent a long career in the US Air Force and special operations in which he was heavily involved with the CIA, then led by its notorious first director Allen Dulles. Prouty later wrote and lectured about some of these clandestine operations and authored the book, JFK, The CIA, Vietnam And The Plot To Assassinate John F. Kennedy.' The Donald Sutherland character called \"X\" in the Oliver Stone movie JFK was apparently based to an extent on Prouty. This guy operated for decades in the shadowy world from which came the real orchestrators of 9/11. Fletcher Prouty said: \"No one has to direct an assassination - it happens. The active role is played secretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions?\" 2 If you look at the evidence detailed in books by myself and others, Fletcher Prouty's words are true in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, his brother Bobby, 210"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 211 Martin Luther King, Princess Diana, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme ... the list could go on for pages. The same is also true of September 11th. NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain The organisation charged with the task of protecting North American airspace in both the United States and Canada is NORAD, the North American Areospace Defense Command, headquartered at the Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado with its operational centre in the nearby Rocky Mountains. This was the organisation that did nothing to prevent the attacks while all hell was happening in the skies over America on September 11th, and it is important to look in some depth at its background and capabilities. NORAD was created by an agreement signed by the US and Canadian governments on May 12th 1958. NORAD's brief, to quote its own website, involves: \"... the monitoring of man-made objects in space, and the detection, validation, and warning of attack against North America whether by aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles, utilizing mutual support arrangements with other commands. Aerospace control includes ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace of Canada and the United States.\" 3 NORAD has an agreement with the civilian Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to respond to civil aviation emergencies when commercial aircraft are hijacked, lose contact with air traffic controllers, or stray off-course. What happened on 9/11, therefore, was exactly what NORAD is there to deal with. The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada officially appoint NORAD's commander. This means, of course, that the President of the United States appoints him. Again quoting the NORAD website: \"Cheyenne Mountain serves as a central collection and coordination facility for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide ... the leadership of Canada and the US with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat.\"' Ah yes, Cheyenne Mountain. It was not long into my research of the global conspiracy in 1992 that I first came across Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. There have been many mysterious animal mutilations in that area, including some at the nearby Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and researchers into \"UFO\" activity have long had their eyes on the Cheyenne Mountain complex. What we do know for sure is that this is the vast super-secret headquarters for the \"defence\" of North America and was the early warning and response centre during the ( manufactured) \"Cold War\" with the Soviet Union. It is also the location of so much more that we are not told about. The complex is mounted on more than 1,300 half-ton springs that allow it to sway up to a foot horizontally in any direction should it be struck by an earthquake or nuclear attack. The two main doors consist of 25 tons of baffled steel, three feet thick, and the complex is located 2,000 feet inside the granite mountain. In the same region are other major military and technology centres like Ent Air Force Base, Fort"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"212 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Carson Army Base, Peterson Airfield, Lowry Air Force bombing range, the US Air Force Academy, the Buckley Air National Guard and Naval Air Station, and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. A Scripps Howard News Service survey reported in 1998 that about 7,000 people were employed within Cheyenne Mountain and that spending on the facility was substantially increased by the best part of $2 billion after the \"Cold War\" was over.' This would seem to be a strange contradiction if you didn't know that the massive network of underground bases and the tunnel systems that connect them across the United States are not there primarily to protect the population at all. Their role is to control the population. Inside Cheyenne Mountain are some of the most brilliant technological minds in the world using and developing technology that is light years ahead of anything you will see in the public arena. It is a big mistake to judge what is possible only on the basis of technology you know about. These guys aren't working with that. The following information comes from the official Cheyenne Mountain website 6 and represents only a fraction of what really goes on there. The excavation of Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs began in May 1961 and was completed in around a year, according to the official story. The NORAD command centre was located here and became fully operational on April 20th 1966 when its duties were transferred from Ent Air Force Base, also in Colorado. NORAD has since been joined inside Cheyenne Mountain by other \"early warning and response\" organisations with the responsibility for defending North America from air attack. One is the Air Force Space Command that is supposed to provide protection from space and missile attack, and this operates the Space Defense Operations Center. Personnel at the Space Defense Operations Center and \"their worldwide sensors, under the direction of Air Defense Command\", supported the first flight of the space shuttle in April 1981.' Cheyenne Mountain has continued to support every shuttle mission since. General Ralph E. Eberhart, the commander of NORAD at the ti me of 9/11, was also commander of Space Command and he took over on February 18th 2000 from General Richard B. Myers who became Deputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, and Chairman immediately after 9/11. Eberhart and Myers also both served at the \"CIA\" Air Force Base at Langley, Virginia, from where, it is claimed, jets were scrambled (far too late) to intercept Flight 77 as it headed for Washington. Eberhart was Commander, Air Combat Command, from June 1999 to February 2000 when he replaced Myers at NORAD. More about Myers' behaviour on September 11th in due course. I am going to detail at some length the capabilities of the Cheyenne Mountain complex for reasons that will become very clear. This is what its official website says about the NORAD operations today, and the information is highly revealing in the light of the events - or non-events - of September 11th: \"The Air Defense Operations Center uses its air defense network to provide surveillance and control of air operations to North America and unknown traffic. Today the NORAD Combat Operations Center has evolved into the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center that collects data from a worldwide system of satellites, radars, and other sensors and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 213 processes that information on sophisticated computer systems to support critical NORAD and US Space Command missions. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center provides warning of ballistic missile or air attacks against North America, assists the air sovereignty mission for the United States and Canada, and, if necessary, is the focal point for air defense operations to counter enemy bombers or cruise missiles. \"In support of the US Space Command mission, the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center provides a day-to-day picture of precisely what is in space and where it is l ocated. The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center also supports space operations, providing critical information such as collision avoidance data for space shuttle flights and troubleshooting satellite interference problems. Since the Persian Gulf War, the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center has continued to play a vital and expanding role i n supporting our deployed forces with warning for short-range ballistic missiles such as the Iraqi Scuds. Cheyenne Mountain operations are conducted by six centers manned 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The centers are: Command Center, Air Defense Operations Center, Missile Warning Center, Space Control Center, Combined I ntelligence Watch Center, and the Systems Center.\" And it goes on: \"The Command Center is the heart of operations in Cheyenne Mountain. In this center, the Command Director and his crew serve as the NORAD and US Space Command Commander in Chief's direct representatives for monitoring, processing, and i nterpreting missile, space or air events which could have operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could be potential threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas. The Command Center is linked directly to the National Command Authorities of both the US and Canada as well as to regional command centers overseas. When required, the Command Director must consult directly with the NORAD and US Space Command Commander in Chief for time-critical assessments of missile, air, and space events; he takes action to ensure the Commander in Chief's response and direction are properly conveyed and executed ... .. The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the air surveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they monitored over 700 'unknown' radar tracks entering North American airspace. Many of these were subsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred from flight plans or used i mproper procedures. Yet nearly 100 were identified as illegal drug-carrying aircraft that were subsequently prosecuted by the US and Canadian Drug Enforcement Agencies.\" 8 The technology located within Cheyenne Mountain is the state of the state of the state of the art. Its website explains how the Missile Warning Center employs a \"worldwide sensor and communications network to provide warning of missile attacks, either long or short range, launched against North America or our forces overseas\". So much so that its technology provides information \"regarding missile"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"214 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. launches anywhere on earth which are detected by the strategic missile warning system and which could be a potential threat to Canada or the US\". The Space Control Center at Cheyenne Mountain, opened in March 1994, has the highly sophisticated technology that \"supports the space control missions of space surveillance and protection of our assets in space\" and its primary objective is to perform \"the surveillance mission ... to detect, track, identify, and catalog all man- made objects in space\". The Center has a computerised catalogue of \"all orbiting space objects, charts objects, charts present position, plots future orbital paths, and forecasts times and general locations for significant objects re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.\" The website tells us that the Space Control Center is currently tracking some 8,000 \"on-orbit objects\", and this information is used to provide NASA with collision avoidance information during space flights. Cheyenne Mountain is also home to the Combined Intelligence Watch, which serves as North America's \"indications and warning center for worldwide threats from space, missile, and strategic air activity, as well as geopolitical unrest that could affect North America and US forces/interests abroad\". 9 Put another way, they have a satellite surveillance network that could read your licence plate from space wherever you may be. The Combined Intelligence Watch \"gathers intelligence information to assist all the Cheyenne Mountain work centers in correlating and analyzing events to support NORAD and US Space Command decision makers\".\" There is a Systems Center that \"ensures continuity of operations throughout the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center by providing communications and computer systems management for over 100 computer systems and 600 communications circuits in support of NORAD and US Space Command missile warning, space control, and air defense missions\".\" \"Most unique installation\" Cheyenne Mountain calls itself one of the most unique installations in the world and is the likely command centre for the \"Star Wars\" satellite network so beloved of both the Bushes and Reagan (the Bushes). The complex has the potential for massive cooperation and coordination between apparently unconnected organisations because it employs staff from the Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force and Canadian Forces. Cheyenne Mountain operates military communication and navigation satellites that direct and guide \"western\" armies during their bombardments of Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Major Mike Birmingham, an Army spokesman for the Colorado base, said: \"Space support basically allowed US forces to perform that famous 'left hook' operation [employed during the Gulf War]. The Iraqis assumed no one could navigate that well in the desert.\"\" But, despite all of this amazing technology and response capability, four commercial airliners hijacked in American airspace proved too much for them on September 11th. Why? If anyone is still in any doubt about the technological and coordination capability we are talking about here and its instant communications network throughout the United States government, military and air traffic surveillance, the official Cheyenne Mountain website says:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 215 \"The Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center comprises the largest and most complex command and control network in the world. The system uses satellites, microwave radio routes, and fiber optic links to transmit and receive vital communications. Two blast-hardened microwave antennas and two underground coaxial cables transmit the bulk of electronic information. Most of this information is data sent from the worldwide space surveillance and warning network directly to computers inside the Mountain. Redundant and survivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers around the world.\" 13 Now take a deep breath and consider the following. This was the very organisation that failed to respond in time to the hijacking of four commercial airliners in American airspace over densely populated areas between 8.13am, when communication was lost with Flight 11, and at least 9.38 when Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. That's around an hour and a half and not one NORAD plane was able (so they tell us) to intercept any of the hijacked aircraft in the very airspace its fantastic technology is specifically there to monitor and protect. Flight 77 alone, the one that hit the Pentagon, was in the air for 80 minutes and is officially reported to have performed a U-turn from its authorised course more than 40 minutes before impact. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Another point to emphasise is that the civilian (US government) Federal Aviation Administration, which has a joint response procedure with NORAD to respond to hijackings, is a monumentally corrupt organisation steeped in the culture of the cover-up. I am not referring to most of the employees, nor even those who tell the media what the high-ups tell them to say. I am speaking of the controlling core of the FAA. Rodney Stich, a former navy and airline pilot and crash investigator with the FAA, has widely documented some of the corruption that he experienced directly and through his own investigations. He is the author of the book Unfriendly Skies 14 and he reveals the following: • \t FAA management personnel have refused to take action when faced with major air safety and criminal violations reported by air safety inspectors. • \t FAA management warns federal air safety inspectors not to report air safety problems or air safety violations. • \t Official government air sa y reports of major air safety problems and air safety violations filed by federal air safety inspectors are destroyed. • \t FAA management harass, threaten and retaliate against federal air safety inspectors who try to report or carry out the federal government's air safety responsibilities. • \t Key federal air safety inspectors are removed from their government air safety duties to stop them from reporting and taking actions on serious air safety problems or air safety violations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"216 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love.  \t FAA management encourages inspectors to ignore major air safety problems by providing outstanding performance ratings, financial bonuses and promotions to those inspectors who don't report these problems, while doing the opposite to those i nspectors who do report the problems and try to address them.  \t FAA management has covered up crash-causing air safety misconduct exposed by FAA inspectors who have produced official government reports of corruption within the FAA in relation to a series of fatal airline crashes. More than 4,000 pages of hearing transcript exist supporting charges of corrupt and criminal activities within the FAA with regard to a series of fatal airline crashes. 15  \t An FAA administrator covered up testimony and dozens of government documents supporting charges of corruption within the FAA relating to fatal airline crashes, i ncluding a United Airlines DC-8 crash into New York City. Stich is also particularly scathing about the management of United Airlines. He says that the information about FAA corruption has repeatedly been given to the \"politically appointed\" National Transportation Safety Board, but it had been covered up and \"fraud-related\" air disasters were allowed to continue. He accused the Board of \"falsifying accident reports that covered up for their own duplicity in the crashes and deaths\".\" Stich cites the FBI, US attorneys and \"the main justice Department personnel\" as other people and government agencies who have been given the facts about FAA corruption involving major aircraft disasters, but ignored it and even retaliated against him and other former federal agents who tried to expose what was happening. He names the federal judges he says have blocked his efforts to expose FAA corruption through the courts.\" He tells the same story about members of Congress who, he says, ignored the documented evidence of \"hard- core corruption\" within the FAA: \"These are the same members of Congress, and the secretary of the Department of Transportation, whose crocodile tears cover up for the fact that they were repeatedly offered evidence of the corruption that resulted in a series of fatal airline crashes, fatal hijackings, and who helped insure the success of the September 11, 2001, terrorist hijackers. The cover-up of these matters by members of Congress following the September 11 tragedies will insure the protection of the guilty and continuation of the tragic consequences, as documented for the past 40 years in the books described at this site.\" 18 This is the same corrupt network that is telling you what happened when those planes were hijacked on September 11th. It is also the organisation that, with NORAD and the Pentagon, was responsible for responding to what happened that day. The case of Payne Stewart An example of the FAA-NORAD reaction procedure can be seen in the case of the private Learjet carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and his friends on October 25th 1999. Air traffic controllers lost contact with Stewart's plane after it took off from"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 217 Orlando in Florida heading for Dallas. When air traffic controllers realised all was not well, the FAA contacted NORAD and fighter jets were scrambled to check out what was happening. The Learjet had suffered a pressurisation failure and was flying on autopilot while the real pilot and passengers were unconscious. An ABC News report, quoting the Air Force but differing slightly from the findings of the official investigation, said that after contact was initially lost, two F-15s from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida were sent to track the Learjet. The F-15s pulled back and two F-16s in the air from Florida's Eglin Air Force Base took over. When the Learjet reached the Midwest, the Eglin F-16s withdrew and four F-16s and a mid-air refuelling tanker from the Tulsa National Guard replaced them. Finally, two F-16s from Fargo, North Dakota, moved in close to look into the windows to see if the pilot was slumped over and to help clear airspace. \"Officials hoped that the F- 16s could provide assistance to anyone on board who might have helped land the plane safely\", said ABC. 19 When the Learjet ran out of fuel, the F-16 pilots said they saw the plane fall to the ground. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the National Security Council monitored the doomed flight, fearing the jet might crash in a populated area. President Bill Clinton could have ordered fighters to shoot down the Learjet to avoid that potential tragedy, but Lockhart said no such recommendation had been made. Clinton told reporters at the time: \"I am very grateful for the work the FAA did, and for the two Air Force pilots, and the others in the Air Force that monitored this plane and made every effort to try to make contact with it.\" ; ' Another important point to note. If you were \"highly trained\" Arab terrorists from this \"brilliantly organised\" network of Osama bin Laden, a network we are told was capable of hijacking four commercial aircraft at the same time in American airspace, one of your obvious and fundamental calculations would be the possible NORAD reaction time once it was known that the planes had been seized. So why did they choose to hijack the planes that hit the World Trade Center in Boston with a flight time to New York well in excess of possible NORAD reaction time and why would they have Flight 77 and 93 fly way out towards the Midwest before turning around and going all the way back? In the case of Flight 77 it meant that they had to fly for 45 minutes from the time the plane was known to be hijacked to the moment it struck the Pentagon. By any criteria, and the most minimal study of NORAD and FAA procedures on the Internet, they would have known that Air Force jets would be scrambled. They would also have known that these procedures involved the possible shooting down of aircraft that threaten US cities. Any idiot putting this plan together, with the aim of crashing planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, would have known that under NORAD's normal, every-other-day, reaction times, they would have to complete the mission as soon as possible. Taking off from New York and Washington, and crashing them immediately into those buildings would have been the ideal plan for them, surely? Instead, Flight 77, which actually took off from Washington, was allowed to fly away from the city for around three quarters of an hour before the hijack happened and then had to be flown all the way back! This is clearly ridiculous. But, of course, if those behind the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"218 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. attacks knew that NORAD would not be reacting that day, these details would no longer be a problem or have to be taken into account when planning the operation. NORAD's no-show With the fantastic technology available to NORAD and the Cheyenne Mountain operation in general, reacting to what happened on September 11th should not have been a problem. In the past 20 years the technology has been introduced that allows aircraft to be safely navigated and communicated with from almost anywhere on or above the earth, thanks to the satellite network known as the Global Positioning System (GPS). This was created for use by the US military and, says one article, provides \"incredibly accurate position information to end users\" . 21 I'll just give you that again: it provides \"incredibly accurate position information to end users\". Who controls this system? NORAD and the rest of the gang at Cheyenne Mountain. Yet they could not track those hijacked planes and follow what was going on? Besides all the ground-based and satellite based sensors and surveillance, NORAD also directs the AWACS aircraft which are in the air 24 hours a day, refuelling from flying tankers. AWACS (airborne warning and control system) are a modified Boeing airframe from a 707/320 with the 30-foot rotating radar dome on the top. They are the premier \"air battle command and control\" aircraft in the world today. They provide surveillance to NORAD from the earth's surface to the stratosphere over land and water, and one was involved in the Payne Stewart case.' The AWACS radar has a range of more than 250 miles (375.5 kilometres) for low-flying targets and further for those at higher altitudes. It has a \"friend or foe\" identification system that can detect, identify and track friendly or \"enemy\" low-flying aircraft by eliminating \"ground clutter\" that can confuse other radar systems . 23 There is, to put it mildly, no credible excuse imaginable for what happened - or rather didn't - on 9 / 11. What should have happened The system for what should have happened is made very clear in the official regulations and procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) . 24 Chapter 7 of the procedures deals with the \"escort of hijacked aircraft\". It says that an FAA \"hijack coordinator\" on duty at the Washington DC headquarters will request the military to provide an escort aircraft for a confirmed hijacked plane to: (a) assure positive flight following (that's staying on the authorised course to you and me); (b) report unusual observances; and (c) aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency. The escort service, say the regulations, will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center ( NMCC) at the Pentagon. Normally NORAD escort aircraft will take the required action, it says. \"The center/control tower shall coordinate with the designated NORAD ... military unit advising of the hijack aircraft's location, direction of flight, altitude, type of aircraft and recommended flight plan to intercept the hijack aircraft\", the document instructs. Escort aircraft are told to position themselves five miles directly behind the hijacked plane and to approach it from the rear to avoid the possibility of being observed. The escort plane should take the same altitude, speed"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 219 and heading as the hijacked aircraft. When a hijacking happens within the continental United States, say the procedures, the \"appropriate NORAD ... Senior Director\" is forwarded reports of the aircraft's call sign of position of latitude and longitude, heading, speed and altitude. An escort mission can be terminated by FAA headquarters, the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon or major military command authority - in other words NORAD. 25 Air traffic controllers can, through the Federal Aviation Administration, call for military planes to escort or \"intercept\" a commercial aircraft if contact is lost with the pilot, the plane strays from its designated course or anything inexplicable is happening. In 2000, NORAD scrambled jets 125 times in such circumstances. An intercept does not require the approval of the President or some high-up government official. It is a routine response to check what is going on and who is flying the plane. The intention is not to blow the plane from the sky, which would have needed presidential approval or, since 9/11, the approval of the head of NORAD and other designated military chiefs. There is an agreed procedure and code for communicating between intercepting NORAD jets and the commercial aircraft. For example: \"Rocking wings from a position slightly above and ahead of, and normally to the left of, the i ntercepted aircraft and, after acknowledgement, a slow level turn, normally to the left, on to the desired heading = You have been intercepted, follow me; circling aerodrome, lowering l anding gear and over flying runway in direction of landing ... = Land at this aerodrome.\" 26 There is, likewise, a series of coded replies for the other aircraft. If the hijacked plane does not follow these orders, the interceptor can \"make a pass in front of the aircraft\" and eventually \"fire tracer rounds in the airplane's path\" or \"down it with a missile\", according to Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, a NORAD spokesman quoted in the Boston Globe . 27 He also confirmed that fighters' intercepting aircraft was \"routine\". For example, after 9 / 11 when a small private Cessna flew near to President Bush's ranch at Crawford, Texas, the Federal Aviation Administration activated a response through NORAD and two jets were dispatched immediately. They tuned to the pilot's frequency and ordered him to land. Another similar incident was reported in Wood County, Texas, where Rodney Mize, the Sheriff's senior Dispatcher, confirmed that a private plane carrying four reporters from the Houston Chronicle was forced down by two military pilots in A-10 Warthog jets. They flew above and below the plane and it landed at Wisener Field near Mineola. 28 Bush's ranch, it seems, is far more important than the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Such incidents are happening week after week as the Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD activate the response system. The hijack procedure If a problem with an aircraft is considered a possible hijack by the air traffic controller a much higher level of command is activated. FAA spokeswoman, Alison Duquette, explained: \"The air traffic controller would notify the supervisor on the floor, who would then immediately notify the FAA's regional operation center who"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"220 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. would notify NORAD, as well as others.\" 29 In these cases, according the regulations: \"The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC) [based at the Pentagon].\" 30 The Defense Department (DOD) manual covering plane hijackings says: \"In the event of a hijacking, the NMCC will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ... forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\" 31 It was because of this procedure that, according to CNN \"... officers on [sic] the Joint Chiefs were monitoring the [Payne Stewart] Learjet on radar screens inside the Pentagon's National Military Command Center\". 32 Federal Aviation Administration regulations leave air traffic controllers in no doubt that they must never take chances. They are told that if there is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communication they must consider that \"an aircraft emergency exists\"... 33 and... \"If ... you are in doubt that a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though it were an emergency.\" 34 Within Cheyenne Mountain at the NORAD headquarters is the Air Defense Liaison Officer, a top FAA official, who is there to coordinate between the FAA and NORAD in these situations. All these personnel and procedures were in place on September 11th. Yet look at what happened. The NORAD timeline I asked both NORAD and the FAA for the sequence of events and the timeline for what occurred that morning. Both say that only at 8.40am did the FAA notify NORAD that American Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked. Yet contact was lost with the aircraft at 8.13 and at the very latest, by 8.20, it was clear that something serious was wrong. We should know why it took up to 27 minutes, according to the official story, for Air Traffic Control through the FAA to alert NORAD. The New York Times reported that Flight 11 maintained its authorised course for only 16 minutes after take-off and \"just past Worcester, Mass., instead of taking a southerly turn, the Boeing 767 swung to the north at 8.15. It had been taken over ...\" 35 Let's give the controllers another five minutes before they were sure the aircraft was in trouble. This still means that the FAA waited 20 minutes from the point of confirmed lost contact to report that a commercial airliner was not responding to instructions and had changed course with a deactivated transponder over an area of high population and in skies criss-crossed by intensive air traffic. I asked the FAA to confirm when exactly it was known that Flight 11 was in trouble and why it took so long to contact NORAD. The FAA spokesman would not answer. I repeat, the Federal Aviation Administration regulations instruct air traffic controllers that if there is an unexpected loss of radar or radio communication they must consider that \"an aircraft emergency exists\"... and ...\"If ... you are in doubt that a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though it were an emergency.\" This could not be clearer. For goodness sake, the official story says that at 8.24am the controller heard from the cockpit of Flight 11: \"We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport. Nobody move.\" That is said to have happened 16 minutes before we are told the FAA alerted"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 221 NORAD that the plane had been hijacked! The transponder was switched off at 8.20 - 20 minutes before NORAD was informed, we are asked to believe. Let us not forget that through all of this the Air Force was constantly monitoring the commercial air traffic system as it does 24 hours a day. This has to be done to prevent collisions between commercial and Air Force planes. Flight attendant Betty Ong is said to have used a seatback phone to call an American Airlines reservations agent, who contacted the system operations control centre in Fort Worth. Betty is said to have made that call at 8.27 - 13 minutes before NORAD says it was told of the hijack. Even five minutes before the first alleged contact with NORAD, controllers are claimed to have heard another cockpit transmission that said: \"Nobody move please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\" This FAA- NORAD timeline therefore is simply ridiculous. NORAD says it scrambled fighter jets from the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod in Massachusets at 8.46, six minutes after it says it was told of the hijack. At the very time they were taking off, according to the NORAD timeline, Flight 11 was crashing into the north tower. An F- 15 departing from Otis can reach New York City in 10 to 12 minutes, according to an Otis spokeswoman, and can fly three times the speed of a 767. 36 If you take it to be 10 minutes that means the jets would be flying at around 918 miles per hour, well within their top speed. A NORAD spokesman, however, quoted the speed of the scrambled F-15s to me at only between 603 and 675 miles per hour. Why not faster? One of the pilots, named only as \"Duff\", told the BBC \"documentary\" Clear The Skies on September 1st 2002 that they did fly supersonic and this statement added to the contradictions emerging from different spokesmen for the US military. But wait. It gets sillier. The Pentagon told CNN that NORAD was \"informed of the plane striking the World Trade Center at 8.47\". Informed? We are talking about the most sophisticated military surveillance operation on the planet which, in its own words, is \"the largest and most complex command and control network in the world\", utilising a vast network of satellites and cutting-edge-air tracking and surveillance technology. Cheyenne Mountain can tell you if a missile has been launched on the other side of the world and it has to be \"informed\" that a commercial airliner it claims it has already belatedly scrambled jets to intercept has hit the World Trade Center? It's insane. We are told that at 8.52, two F-15 Eagles took off from Otis base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 185 miles from New York, to intercept the second hijacked plane from Boston: Flight 175. About ten minutes later, at 9.03, Flight 175 smashed into the south tower with the F-15s still 70 miles away, so they tell us. One other point is that the World Trade Center is said by one of its first tenants to be a \"No Fly Zone\". If that is so, there has to be a system of air response very close to New York, otherwise the No Fly Zone would be unenforceable. What would be the point of it? Ken Smith, a tenant of the World Trade Center back in 1979, said on Radio Free America that when he was there it was well known by tenants that the WTC was a No Fly Zone. Smith said that any plane off-course within 12 miles of the WTC was given a warning to change direction and he added: \"If you came within five miles they would threaten to shoot you down. If you came within three miles, they could shoot you down.\" 37"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"222 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want.

The official timeline says that the FAA notified NORAD at 9.24am (usually reported as 9.25) that United Airlines Flight 77 from Dulles Airport at Washington DC to Los Angeles may have been hijacked. Yet it was known before 9 o'clock that there was a problem with the plane. As I've mentioned earlier, radar reports published by USA Today suggest that Flight 77 took a massive detour off-course in a north to west to south loop over West Virginia before returning to course for a short time (Figure 15). This course is very different from the routes published by the rest of the media and could, I guess, be a mistake. If it was, however, it was a massive one. USA Today source their route to Flight Explorer, a company that tracks commercial aircraft in real time on the Internet using data supplied by the Federal Aviation Administration. I contacted Flight Explorer and asked for confirmation, or otherwise, of the USA Today graphic. Figure 15: The USA Today version of the route of \t Figure 16: The other version of Flight 77 published Flight 77 \t elsewhere in the media They sent me a course that did not include such a blatant detour (Figure 16), so take your pick. If the \"USA Today\" detour did happen, it would have been at around 8.36 going by the Flight Explorer timeline. This was at least 16 minutes after it was known that Flight 11 had been hijacked, but no action was taken about Flight 77 deviating wildly from its course, if that is what occurred. This continued to be the case even after Flight 11 had smashed into the World Trade Center and it was known that Flight 175 had also been hijacked and crashed into the other tower. I asked the FAA what happened when, according to USA Today, Flight 77 looped off course before returning to the scheduled route because, obviously, I wanted to establish the truth about the course taken by the plane. Did it loop or did it not? If it did, what action had been taken at that time? What communications were made with the cockpit to establish what was going on? The FAA would not answer me, saying I had all the information it could give. The New York Times published what it claimed was a partial transcript of the communication tapes between Flight 77 and air traffic controllers. Air traffic controllers failed to make contact with Flight 77 from 8.56 according the transcript and at 8.58 Jim McDonnell, a representative of American Airlines (AAL), is on the line.

It is worth emphasising that during this exchange, if it is genuine, they acknowledged that two flights bound for Los Angeles had crashed into the World Trade Center and that contact with Flight 77, another Los Angeles-bound plane, had been lost for some 29 minutes by that point. But it would be another ten minutes before NORAD was informed, according to the timeline agreed by both NORAD and the FAA. Staggering. On air safety grounds alone there should have been an immediate response to Flight 77 because of the lethal dangers to other aircraft of flying off-course. Then soon after the \"USA Today loop\" was completed, if that was the case, and it returned to its course the transponder signal"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"226 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. disappeared from the screens of air traffic control and yet still NORAD was not alerted according to the official story agreed by both NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane then did a 180-degree turn near the Ohio border and headed back towards Washington, but still no alert even with two hijacked planes buried in the World Trade Center and with controllers apparently unable to locate Flight 77 on their radar screens for ten minutes. Only at 9.24 was NORAD told by the FAA that Flight 77 was in serious trouble, both organisations told me. As a New York Times report said: \"By 9.25am the FAA, in consultation with the Pentagon, had taken the radical step of banning all take-offs around the country, but fighters still had not been dispatched.\" 39 This was some 40 minutes after Flight 77 dramatically changed course and Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center; it was at least 35 minutes after air traffic controllers knew that Flight 77 had been hijacked; 24 minutes after the transponder signal was lost; 22 minutes after Flight 175 hit the World Trade Center; and 18 minutes after air traffic control facilities throughout the country knew that Flight 77 had likely been hijacked. Yet look at the FAA regulations again for air traffic controllers: \"Consider that an aircraft emergency exists ... when: ... There is unexpected loss of radar contact and radio communications with any ... aircraft \"4° and \"If ... you are in doubt that a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency, handle it as though it were an emergency.\" 41 MSNBC reported the day after 9/11 on how seriously air traffic controllers and their bosses at the FAA are supposed to take aircraft that deviate from their agreed route: \"If a plane deviates by 15 degrees, or two miles from that course, the flight controllers will hit the panic button. They'll call the plane, saying 'American 11, you're deviating from course.' It's considered a real emergency, like a police car screeching down a highway at 100 miles an hour. When golfer Payne Stewart's incapacitated Learjet missed a turn at a fix, heading north instead of west to Texas, F-16 interceptors were quickly dispatched.\" 42 It was at 8.50am that contact was lost with the cockpit of Flight 77. At that moment the flight would have been under the control of the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center, one of 20 regional centres that track flights between airports.\" At 9.02, still 40 minutes before impact with the Pentagon, a controller is reported to have told American Airlines the latest news on Flight 77: \"We lost track control of the guy, he's in coast track but we haven't - we don't really know where his target is and we can't get a hold of him.\" 44 Yet it was only at 9.24 that NORAD was told that Flight 77 \"may\" have been hijacked? Oh do come on, this is the land of clouds and cuckoos. As a Newsday report pointed out: \"The record suggests that teenagers on instant-message networks communicate faster than some federal officials did during the crisis.\" 45 Or as the New York Times put it: . . despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation's airspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners' having already hit the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 227 World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes that scrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.\"\" But even beyond all this, there is a more fundamental question that needs to be answered. Why, when two hijacked airliners had been crashed into the World Trade Center weren't fighter jets deployed immediately to guard the skies over Washington? Surely the first thing you would do after what happened in New York is to instigate air defence for your other most likely targets - Washington being the most obvious. Air traffic controllers mystified The Miami Herald talked to air traffic controllers who said they could not understand why there was no reaction to what was happening in the skies that morning.\" Why no reaction from the FAA and the military? \"That's a question that more and more people are going to ask,\" one controller in Miami told the Herald. \"What the hell went on here? Was anyone doing anything about it? Just as a national defense thing, how are they able to fly around and no one go after them?\"\" The Herald quoted controllers who said that even with the transponder silent, the plane would have been visible on radar both to controllers who handle cross-continent air traffic and to a Federal Aviation Administration command centre outside of Washington. The FAA would not discuss with the Miami Herald the track of Flight 77 or what happened in air-control centres while it was in flight, and nor would American Airlines. Air traffic controllers told the Herald that the trouble should have been instantly noticeable. Flight 77, like all such planes, would have first showed up on radar screens as a short solid line, the Herald reported, with a readout that identifies the plane and gives its altitude and speed. When the transponder shuts down, the short line vanishes. The speed number goes away too. \"It's just something that catches your eye\", one controller said.\" The first move when a transponder goes down would be to contact the pilot and tell him the transponder wasn't working. But even if the plane remained silent, controllers could still find it - by switching their screen display to the old- fashioned radar that bounces a signal off the plane's metal skin, the Herald said. The report went on: \" Military jets are routinely scrambled in the case of hijackings and \"runners,\" planes that do not answer or do not heed air traffic controllers. But FAA officials would not say when controllers detected the errant Flight 77 or whether any fighter jets were able to get into the air to confront it. Fighter jets are based nearby, in Virginia, and could have reached the White House within minutes, aviation sources say ... \"... The FAA has a detailed hijacking manual: Supervisors are notified. The FAA command center near Washington and the FBI are put on alert. Military jets are scrambled to follow the plane. Air-traffic controllers try to figure out where the hijacker wants to go and, if necessary, clear an air space of other traffic.\" 50"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"228 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Big Dick reveals all Vice President Dick Cheney told NBC's Meet the Press 51 that from the time that Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center the secret service travelling with President Bush in Florida had \"open lines\" with the Federal Aviation Administration. He said: \"The secret service has an arrangement with the FAA. They had open lines after the World Trade Center was ...\" He didn't finish the sentence, no doubt because he realised he had said too much, and it is worth pondering the wider implications of that statement. The FAA had open lines with the secret service after the World Trade Center was hit? That happened at 8.46, about the time that Flight 77 was known to be in trouble, and yet the FAA said they did not tell NORAD and the Pentagon Command Center about Flight 77 until 9.24 when they had already established open lines to the secret service. Are we being told that the Pentagon and NORAD did not have open lines also with the FAA and were able to follow in real time the communications and non- communications from the cockpits long before a single fighter jet was deployed? Indeed the FAA and NORAD have both confirmed to me that they had open lines to discuss Flights 77 and 93, the one that crashed in Pennsylvania. I asked the FAA when exactly these open lines were established, but its spokesman would not say. Surely in any sane system these would have been established, as Cheney indicated, at least from the moment the first plane struck the World Trade Center. So, again, why the delay in responding? We are told that after contact was lost with Flight 77 and its transponder was deactivated, an \"unidentified\" aircraft was eventually picked up on radar heading for Washington at some 500 miles an hour and this turned out to be Flight 77. Unidentified? Have you seen the tracking technology available to NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain? Even when a transponder is turned off the plane can still be tracked by conventional radar, let alone by the technology those guys have. At around 9.27, NORAD says it ordered jets scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (the base of the CIA's own fleet of military aircraft) to intercept Flight 77. Before becoming head of NORAD, General Ralph Eberhart was Commander, Air Combat Command, at Langley. At 9.35, it is said, three F-16 Fighting Falcons took off from Langley for Washington. Note the approximately eight minutes' response time before they were in the air in this official story when the Air Force apparently claims response times of scramble to 29,000 feet in two and a half minutes. 52 An F-16 has a top speed of some 1,800 miles an hour, twice the speed of sound. At 9.37, Flight 77 was \"lost from radar screens\", the story goes, and a minute later hit the Pentagon, precisely 60 years to the day since construction of that building began on September 11th 1941, the year of Pearl Harbor. The NORAD jets arrived at 9.49, so we are told. Shucks, just missed again. What terrible bad luck. These jets flew at speeds of about \".9 mach\" or just below the speed of sound, according to information given to me by NORAD spokesman Barry Venable, who, I must say, was extremely thorough and efficient in his dealings with me .53 He said that .9 mach is between 603 and 675 miles per hour"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 229 depending on the altitude the planes were flying. The higher they fly the faster they go. Of course, their top speed of 1,800 miles an hour is not possible over land at lower altitudes, but less than the speed of sound for aircraft capable of twice the speed of sound might legitimately be questioned here when they were pursuing a hijacked airliner heading for the US capital after two others had been crashed into the World Trade Center. Barry Venable quoted similar speeds for the planes NORAD says were scrambled from Otis Air Force Base, but an Otis spokesman quoted by the local Cape Cod Times said the 153 miles from there to New York can be made by an F-15 in as little as ten minutes - that's around 918 miles per hour. At that speed the 130 miles from Langley to Washington would be completed in around eight minutes. This speed would have put jets from Langley over the Pentagon at about 9.38/39 - just as Flight 77 was turning in to crash and not \"12 minutes [or] 105 miles\" away as the NORAD timelines says they were at the time of impact. A commercial airliner can fly from Washington to Ohio, turn back and fly all the way from the Midwest to cross a No Fly Zone and crash into the headquarters of the most powerful military force on earth without a military response worth the name? Vice President Dick Cheney even told the NBC Meet the Press programmes' that: \"It doesn't do any good to put up a combat air patrol if you don't give them instructions to act, if, in fact, they feel it's appropriate.\" He says this to divert attention from the fact that this is precisely what is happening every week in the skies of North America. You can check out and intercept (\"stop, deflect, or interrupt the progress or intended course of\")\" an aircraft without shooting it down, for goodness sake. Again this was Cheney's attempt to mislead people from the central questions that will unleash the genie. Why not Andrews? Langley is around 130 miles from Washington so why did NORAD say it scrambled jets from that far away when Andrews Air Force Base, the one designated to defend Washington DC, is only a little over ten miles from the capital and pilots from there could have had breakfast and still intercepted Flight 77 with time to spare? This is even allowing for the fact that NORAD only activated interception procedures some 34 minutes after contact with the plane was lost. Andrews Air Force Base is a minute or so by fighter jet from Washington DC and that's why it is the capital's first line of air defence (see map, Figure 17 overleaf ). In the name of sanity, the airspace above the Pentagon and the White House is a No Fly Zone and of course there are going to be squadrons on standby at the nearest Air Force base to defend that. Andrews is one of the most famous bases in America because it is the home of Air Force One, the President's plane, and foreign heads of state often pass through there. Again, are you going to locate the presidential plane at a base that does not have fighters that are ready to move at a moment's notice? Andrews, in fact, has two major squadrons on what are officially termed the highest possible state of readiness. These are the 121st Fighter Squadron of the 113th Fighter Wing and the 321st Marine Fighter Attack Squadron of the 49th Marine Air Group.

The sidewinder missiles carried by F-16s have a range of 18 miles and they would only have to get off the ground, lock in and fire to stop a plane crashing into the Pentagon. The fact that these planes were not scrambled from Andrews at any time before impact with the Pentagon is stunning. The Andrews AFB website went down immediately after September 11th and did not reappear until around mid - November. 56 When it came back online it no longer had a link to the Air Force web pages describing the capabilities and mission of 113th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard at Andrews - the capability of reacting immediately to any threat by air to Washington .57 A website called dcmiltary.com is authorised to supply information to those employed by US forces. It reported before 9/11 (although I haven't been able to find the web page since) that Andrews is the base for the 121st Fighter Squadron, 113th Fighter Wing, and it confirmed its role: \"... as part of its dual mission, the 113th provides capable and ready response forces for the District of Columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency.

Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 321, a Marine Corps Reserve squadron, flies the sophisticated F/A-18 Hornet. Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 49, Detachment A, provides maintenance and supply functions necessary to maintain a force in readiness.\" 59 These units are operated by the District of Colombia National Guard, headquartered at Andrews, and its official website has this to say about its capabilities: \"The DC Air National Guard is located on Andrews Air Force Base, in Camp Springs, Maryland. We are home to the 113th Wing: the 121 Fighter Squadron (including the F- 16 Fighting Falcons) and the 201 Air Lift Squadron; the 121 Weather Squadron; and the 231 Combat Communications Squadron. \"The DC Air National Guard has called Andrews AFB home since the unit's post-war reorganization in 1946. We draw our members from throughout the District of Columbia metropolitan area, as well as from more distant points in Maryland, Virginia, and neighboring states. \"The unit has about 1,400 people, most of whom spend one weekend each month at Andrews for scheduled training.

The F16 is the ninth different type of fighter in the wing's 44- year history.\" And look at how it completes this piece of self-congratulation: \"Throughout its existence, the men and women of the DC Air National Guard have been and will continue to be a vital part of the community and the total force. They stand ready to respond to the needs of the District of Columbia - and the nation - should the need arise.\" [Except on September 11th] 60 The DC Air National Guard even calls itself the \"Capital Guardians\"! Before 9/11, although not it seems afterwards, they made their mission crystal clear when they claimed to ...\"provide combat units in the highest possible state of readiness\". So where on earth were they on September 11th when a commercial airliner flew back towards Washington, for 45 minutes after Air Traffic Control lost contact, to crash a minute's flying time from Andrews AFB? It was not the fault of the pilots who, I'm sure, are utterly bewildered at what happened. It is the highest level of the military and government that we have to focus on - those with the power to decide not to deploy from Andrews. NORAD spokesman Barry Venable told me that NORAD fighters were \"not standing alert, nor even stationed, at Andrews AFB on"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"232 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want.

The USAF did indeed have fighters stationed at Andrews AFB on 11 September, but not for the purpose of standing air sovereignty alert - a role NORAD performs.\" 61 Then how come fighters from Andrews were in the sky over Washington immediately after the Pentagon was hit? USA Today, America's national newspaper, also sought to explain away the \"Andrews mystery\" by reporting that \"Andrews Air Force Base, home to Air Force One, is only 15 miles [sic] away from the Pentagon, but it had no fighters assigned to it. Defense officials won't say whether that has changed.\" 62 Not even NORAD claims there were no fighters at Andrews, and what kind of journalism is it that prints this story when the truth is only a \"Netfind\" away? The same USA Today edition also said in direct contradiction: \"The District of Columbia National Guard maintained fighter planes at Andrews Air Force Base, only about 15 miles [sic] from the Pentagon, but those planes were not on alert and not deployed.\" 63 The San Diego Union-Tribune, however, told the truth about Andrews when it reported: \"Air defense around Washington is provided mainly by fighter planes from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland near the District of Columbia border. The DC Air National Guard i s also based there and equipped with F-16 fighter planes, a National Guard spokesman said. But the fighters took to the skies over Washington only after the devastating attack on the Pentagon ...\" 64 Other media sources also reported that fighters from Andrews AFB were deployed over Washington. NBC Nightly News said: \"It was after the attack on the Pentagon that the Air Force then decided to scramble F-16s out of the DC National Guard Andrews Air Force Base to fly a protective cover over Washington, DC.\" 65 The UK Daily Telegraph said: \"Within minutes of the attack [on the Pentagon] American forces around the world were put on one of their highest states of alert - Defcon 3, just two notches short of all-out war - and F-16s from Andrews Air Force Base were in the air over Washington DC.\" 66 A \"former Pentagon Air Traffic Controller\" quoted, but not named, is said to have commented: \"All those years ago when I was in the Pentagon, this wouldn't have happened. Air Traffic Control Radar images were (and are) available in the understructures of the Pentagon, and any commercial flight within 300 miles of DC that made an abrupt course change toward Washington, turned off their transponder, and refused to communicate with ATC, would have been intercepted at supersonic speeds within a max of 9 minutes by a fighter out of Andrews. Period. Why these planes weren't, baffles me. I f we could get fighters off the ground in two minutes then, we could now.\" 67 And yet a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley, made this astonishing statement: \"Planes come up and down the Potomac all the time. You can hear them in the building. There was no warning.\"' John A. Koskinen, the Washington DC City Administrator, said the District was \"largely helpless\" to stop such attacks.' Utter garbage."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Alice in wonderland and the world Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 233 What happened to flight 93? United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco was, we are told, reported to NORAD as a possible hijack at 9.16am. This was about around 16 minutes after the aircraft is thought to have been taken over. At 9.35am Flight 93 filed a new flight plan and headed for Washington. I asked the FAA who in the cockpit filed that plan and what exchange took place between air traffic control, but the spokesman said he could give me no information on this. At 9.40, it is claimed, the transponder signal stopped and \"radar contact was lost\". This is nonsense. We are talking NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain here and, like the FAA system, they can still track a plane after the transponder has been switched off. At approximately 10.03 according to the NORAD timeline (anything up to 10.37 according to others), Flight 93 \"crashed\" near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and the NORAD timeline says that no fighter jet was within 100 miles of the plane when it went down. By 10.03, if we take the NORAD version, it was an hour and 11 minutes since fighters are said to have been scrambled from Otis AFB to New York and 50 minutes since Flight 93 was reported to NORAD as a possible hijack. My own feeling is that at least one jet did get to Flight 93 on this occasion and may well have shot down the aircraft. I will elaborate on the background later. What a shambles The FAA-NORAD-Pentagon response procedure in these circumstances could not be clearer in the official regulations. Equally clear is that on September 11th, on that day of all days, that response was a disgrace. I do not believe for a second that this is unconnected to the fact that the Illuminati, working through US government agencies, wanted the attacks of September 11th to happen as they did. Somewhere in that normal line of response from the FAA's air traffic control through to the Pentagon and the scrambling of NORAD jets a spanner was thrown in the works to slow down the reaction times. If you accept that the FAA and NORAD timelines are correct, the FAA is an organisation that has some serious questions to answer, but won't. I asked the FAA media spokesman Fraser Jones the following questions: 1. I have been going through the timeline you sent to me and I have some questions. I asked when there was first known to be a problem with the four flights and in answer to that you gave me the times that the FAA informed NORAD. These are not the same times as when a problem was first identified. Could I have the times when problems were first identified? 2. Flight 11 failed to respond to the air traffic controller at 8.13 and yet both the FAA and NORAD say that the FAA did not inform NORAD of a problem until 8.40. Why a delay of 27 minutes? 3. Flight 77 failed to respond to air traffic control at 8.50am and six minutes later the transponder was turned off ... yet both NORAD and the FAA say that the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"234 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. FAA did not inform NORAD of a problem until 9.24. Why the delay of 34 minutes, especially when, by 9.03am, two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center? 4. Before Flight 77 turned around it made a detour off course in a north-west- south loop over West Virginia [according to USA Today] before returning briefly to its agreed route. Why was this ignored? 5. At what time exactly did the FAA and NORAD establish open lines to discuss Flight 77 and Flight 93? 6. NORAD has told me that the FAA is responsible for policing No Fly Zones like the one over Washington and New York. What is the procedure the FAA has for doing this, what aircraft does it use and where are they based, and. what happened on September 11th when there was no response? If the FAA doesn't have planes, then who does? What is the point of a No Fly Zone if there is nothing to defend it? Mr Jones replied that he had already provided \"all the info\" he had for questions one to five (none of which gave me an answer to any of them). For question six he said: \"The FAA monitors prohibited airspace and would be aware if a pilot blundered into such an area. Our mission is not civil defense. We would help coordinate the appropriate response given the circumstances\".\" What on earth does that mean? NORAD told me that it is not responsible for policing the No Fly Zone over Washington and it was a matter for the civilian FAA. The FAA tells me it \"monitors prohibited airspace\" and would be aware if a pilot blundered into such an area and would then help to coordinate the appropriate response in the circumstances. Oh really well take your time, no rush. How long does it take for a plane to enter restricted airspace over Washington before it parks itself in the White House, Capitol Hill, or the Pentagon? Seconds. So where would the immediate air or ground-to-air response come from? Langley AFB 130 miles away? What the hell use would that be? Now the FAA and NORAD are either not telling me the truth or there is no system for protecting No Fly Zones. One or the other must be the case given what they have both said. I asked Fraser Jones whom the FAA would contact when the No Fly Zone threatened to be breached and they \"coordinate the appropriate response in the circumstances\", but I received no reply. Couldn't be Andrews AFB and the DC Air National Guard could it? Military special operations commander was head of FAA \"security\" The head of security for the FAA on September 11th was Michael Canavan, who resigned after only 10 months in the job shortly after the attacks. Canavan is a retired US Army lieutenant general, who had been Chief of Staff of the US European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. Canavan has a considerable background in US Special Operations, which, according to the Department of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • House of cards \t 235 Defense's Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, are defined as: \"Operations conducted by specially organized, trained, and equipped military and paramilitary forces to achieve military, political, economic or psychological objectives by unconventional means in hostile, denied or politically sensitive areas.\" In short: operations that are above the law and off the record. Canavan was Commanding General, Special Operations Command, Europe, and Commanding General, Joint Special Operations Command, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In July 2002, the military announced that four soldiers with Special Forces based at Fort Bragg had murdered their wives and three of the men had recently returned from Afghanistan. Two had also killed themselves and the other two had been charged with murder. The military said the murders were \"not stress related\". This is the same Fort Bragg that provided several officers from its US Army 4th Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Group to work in the news division at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta in the final days of the Kosovo War, according to media reports, and also staffed the National Security Council's Office of Public Diplomacy (OPD), a shadowy government propaganda agency that planted stories in the US media supporting the Reagan-Bush Administration's policies in Central America. The Miami Herald of July 19th 1987 quoted a \"senior US official\" as describing the OPD as a \"vast psychological warfare operation of the kind the military conducts to influence a population in enemy territory.\" These are the sorts of operations that Michael Canavan, the head of FAA security on September 11th, would have been involved with in his high positions in Special Operations Command. What is absolutely clear is that the FAA's response to the hijackings that morning was bizarre, and this happened in what must be the best-defended airspace in the world. Let us consider again the capabilities detailed in the official websites of the FAA's partners in policing US airspace, NORAD and Cheyenne Mountain:  \t The NORAD Command Center at Cheyenne Mountain is responsible for \"monitoring, processing, and interpreting missile, space or air events which could have operational impacts on our forces or capabilities, or could be potential threats to North America or US and allied forces overseas.\" So why not on September 11th?  \t Cheyenne Mountain serves as a central collection and coordination facility for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide ... the leadership of Canada and the US with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat.\" So why not on September 11th?  The Command Centre is linked directly to the National Command Authorities of both the US and Canada as well as to regional command centres overseas. When required, the Command Director must consult directly with the NORAD and US Space Command Commander in Chief for time-critical assessments of missile, air, and space events; he takes action to ensure the Commander in Chief's response and direction are properly conveyed and executed ... So why not on September 11th?"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"236 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. • \"... The Air Defense Operations Center provides command and control for the air surveillance and air defense network for North America. In 1994, they monitored over 700 'unknown' radar tracks entering North American airspace. Many of these were subsequently identified as friendly aircraft that had erred from flight plans or used improper procedures.\" So where was the monitoring on September 11th? • \t There is also a Systems Center that \"ensures continuity of operations throughout the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center by providing communications and computer systems management for over 100 computer systems and 600 communications circuits in support of NORAD and US Space Command missile warning, space control, and air defence missions. So why not on September 11th? • \t Cheyenne Mountain is responsible for \"... the monitoring of man-made objects in space, and the detection, validation, and warning of attack against North America whether by aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles, utilizing mutual support arrangements with other commands. Aerospace control includes ensuring air sovereignty and air defense of the airspace of Canada and the United States.\" So why not on September 11th? The standing rule of NORAD officals is to apparently give unknown airplanes approaching US airspace two minutes to identify themselves. If this does not happen fighter-intercepts are scrambled in two minutes without exception. The head of the Russian Air Force, Anatoli Kornukov, said: \"As soon as something like that [the hijackings] happens here, I am reported about that right away and in a minute we are all up.\"\" The response to what happened on September 11th was a total shambles, but what was it that Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty said? \"No one has to direct an assassination - it happens. The active role is played secretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who has the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions?\" He could not have put it better in relation to 9/11. The FAA and NORAD are not the only ones who have some serious questions to answer.

Without censorship, things can get terribly confused in the public mind. General William Westmoreland, Commander US forces in Vietnam T wo weeks after the attacks on America, General Richard B. Myers officially took over as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Before his appointment to the Pentagon as Deputy Chairman in 2000, he was the Commander of NORAD. Myers, therefore, knew precisely what the procedures were for reacting to unexplained happenings with planes in North American airspace. As we have seen, Federal Aviation Administration regulations say: \"The escort service will be requested by the FAA hijack coordinator by direct contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC)\". The NMCC is based at the Pentagon, headquarters of the Joint Chiefs, and the Department of Defense's own manual says that: \"In the event of a hijacking, the National Military Command Center will be notified by the most expeditious means by the Federal Aviation Administration. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ... forward requests for DOD [Department of Defense] assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\" This is the same National Military Command Center that claims it had no warning that an airliner was about to crash into its own building some 45 minutes after it deviated off course! Where was General Myers while all this was going on and what were the top brass in the Pentagon doing all this ti me? What was Defense Secretary Rumsfeld doing? Where was President Bush? Myers knew the response procedures. He knew that Andrews AFB around ten miles down the road had all that was necessary to respond to Flight 77 as it headed for Washington. Yet nothing was done. The New York Times tried to explain what was happening at the Pentagon that morning: \"During the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of hijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officials in a command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do.\" ( No, you didn't misread that.) 240"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 241 \"But despite elaborate plans that link civilian and military efforts to control the nation's airspace in defense of the country, and despite two other jetliners' having already hit the World Trade Center in New York, the fighter planes that scrambled into protective orbits around Washington did not arrive until 15 minutes after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.\" 1 What? Military chiefs in the Pentagon command centre were \"urgently talking about what to do?\" Uh? These are the guys who are supposed to protect the United States from nuclear attack! \"Er, now there's a missile heading for us gentlemen that will end life in America as we know it. This is due to land on this building in two minutes, now what do you think we should do?\" If they were talking to air traffic officials (FAA) during the hour in question why no response from NORAD? Why are we told that NORAD, which is under Pentagon command, was not alerted about Flight 77 until 9.24 when the Pentagon command centre was \"urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do\" for \"the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of the hijackers\"? Given what had happened in New York why weren't planes scrambled to patrol the skies over Washington as a matter of course anyway? General Myers told his Senate confirmation hearing when he became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he pledged \"...to keep our armed forces at that razor's edge\"! A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Vic Warzinski, even had the audacity to tell Newsday that: \"The Pentagon was simply not aware that this aircraft was coming our way ...\" 2 The Cheyenne Mountain official website says of the NORAD Command Center: \"Redundant and survivable communications hot lines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers around the world.\"' And the Pentagon didn't know that a hijacked plane heading for its own city for more than 45 minutes was coming its way?? CNN reported that while Payne Stewart's plane was flying on auto pilot \"... officers on [sic] the joint Chiefs were monitoring the Learjet on radar screens inside the Pentagon's National Military Command Center\".' Of course they were, that's what they are supposed to do. Why are we told they did not do this on September 11th when four planes were hijacked, and that they didn't know one was heading in their direction? It is an insult to the intelligence. CNN also quoted officials at the Pentagon as saying they were never made aware of the threat from hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 until after it crashed in Pennsylvania.' Reports say that the Federal Aviation Administration informed NORAD at 9.16am that Flight 93 may have been hijacked and the transponder was turned off at 9.40, although NORAD and the FAA both told me that open lines between them were established to discuss Flight 93. There is no way that the Pentagon's National Military Command Center with open lines to the FAA and NORAD was not told of the hijack of Flight 93 until it crashed after 10am. The Pentagon's entire story is nonsense, of course it is, and it is designed to hide the simple truth - at the highest levels of power within the US government and military these attacks were being allowed to happen."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"242 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon on the west side of what is the biggest office complex in the world. This is the opposite side of the building to where the main offices of Donald Rumsfeld and the military top brass and the National Military Command Center are located. The targeted section had been the first of five to undergo renovations and strengthening to protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. Yet this is the very section these \"highly trained, highly professional\" terrorists aimed for?? Such is the size and strength of the Pentagon that Rumsfeld said that he only felt a \"jarring thing\" when the plane hit. 6 If you were really a crazed Islamic fanatic dedicated to attacking the \"Great Satan America\", why would you aim the plane at the very opposite side of a 29-acre, six million-square- foot building to where your real targets are? The same reason why Timothy McVeigh parked the Ryder truck as far away as possible from his alleged target, the offices of the ATF, I guess. Where was Myers? General Myers was Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on September 11th in the absence abroad of the outgoing General Hugh Shelton. Myers would be confirmed as Shelton's successor at a Senate hearing only two days later. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the highest-ranking uniformed military post and third in command of US forces with only the president and the defense secretary above him in the line of command. Surely this is a man who would have been at the centre of events with America \"under attack\" from terrorists. Where was Myers while all hell was breaking loose in those two horrific hours? It turns out, and I'm not kidding, that he was having a meeting with Senator Max Cleland of Georgia on Capitol Hill. I think its best if you sit down while you read the following, and breathing deeply might help too. This is Myers' account of his movements that morning described in an interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service: \"I remember it was like watching a bad movie. I was on Capitol Hill. I was about ready to meet with Senator Cleland. I was meeting with him in preparation for my hearing, my confirmation hearing to be the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I remember before we walked in there was a TV that was playing and somebody has said, 'An airplane has hit one of the World Trade Center towers'. They thought it was an airplane, and they thought it was a small airplane or something like that. So we walked in and we did the office call with Senator Cleland.\" The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the US military on American soil that day hears that a plane has hit the World Trade Center and instead of checking it out he goes into a routine meeting with a senator about confirmation hearings? Come again? And it gets worse: \"Sometime during that office call the second tower was hit. Nobody informed us of that. But when we came out, that was obvious. Then right at that time somebody said the Pentagon has been hit.\"'"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 243 Hold on, let me sit down here and strap in. No one informs the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military man on American soil that day, that a second airliner has hit the World Trade Center when, down in Florida, the White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, is telling President Bush that \"America is under attack\", according to the official story? General Myers' account makes no rational sense whatsoever. Do they really think we are all so stupid that we would believe that the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not contactable at all times and that he would not have been told of the second plane - indeed the first also - as a matter of course by the Pentagon? If he wasn't, why the hell not? Myers then says that \"right at the time\" when he and Cleland came out of their meeting \"somebody said the Pentagon has been hit\". We can therefore add a timeline to his story. Myers' account puts him in the meeting with Cleland at no later than around gam before the second plane crashed and he did not come out until the Pentagon was struck, that's no earlier than 9.38 - 9.40. How amazing that this meeting took place across precisely the time that the attacks were happening. The New York Times tells us that \" during the hour or so that American Airlines Flight 77 was under the control of hijackers, up to the moment it struck the west side of the Pentagon, military officials in a command center on the east side of the building were urgently talking to law enforcement and air traffic control officials about what to do.\" 8 All this was happening and they didn't inform their ultimate boss that day who was in a meeting down the street on Capitol Hill? Smell a rat? I smell a whole species. General Myers says that when he emerged from the meeting to be told what most of the world already knew, he launched into action: \"I mmediately, somebody handed me a cell phone, and it was General Eberhart out at NORAD in Colorado Springs talking about what was happening and the actions he was going to take. We immediately, after talking to him, jumped in the car, ran back to the Pentagon.\" [How do you do both?] 9 I have detailed the fantastic technology and communications network at the disposal of NORAD and the Pentagon, and yet NORAD contacts the acting military head of US forces only after three planes have crashed over nearly an hour and when somebody handed him a cell phone? The NORAD commander General Eberhart - the man who replaced Myers at Cheyenne Mountain - is telling him \"the actions he is going to take\" after three airliners are embedded in three of America's biggest buildings and 3,000 people are dead? What in God's name had Eberhart and his NORAD operation been doing all this time? If you feel you can stand any more, General Myers also told Armed Forces Radio and Television: \"The Chairman [General Shelton] had left that morning to go to Europe, so he was somewhere over the Atlantic. As I got to the Pentagon I noticed a lot of people were coming out of the Pentagon. Of course they'd been told to evacuate. My concern was where can you best discharge your duties? ... [My] battle station was in the National Military Command Center. I asked if it was still running, they said it sure is, so I went"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"244 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. back in the building to the Command Center and was joined shortly thereafter by the Secretary of Defense. The Deputy Secretary actually went to another location at that point. We did what had to be done in terms of the command and control of the day ...\" The interviewer asked Myers if he could believe that it was actually a terrorist attack: \"I didn't know what to believe at the time. That was the problem. We had these events, and then subsequently the airplane went down in Pennsylvania. We were trying to tie this together, what does this mean? General Eberhart was working with the Federal Aviation Agency trying to figure out the logical steps at this point. We had some fighters airborne at that time in case we had some hijacked airplanes that were possibly a threat to other institutions or structures, but it was initially pretty confusing. You hate to admit it, but we hadn't thought about this.\" Given what is claimed to have happened, the voices said to have been heard from the cockpit radios, and reports by passengers and attendants on cellphones and airphones that morning, to say they didn't know this was a \"terrorist attack\" is an unbelievable misrepresentation of events. Only with three planes down, thousands dead, and a fourth soon to crash in Pennsylvania, did the top military officer on duty that day walk into the command centre at the Pentagon which, as we have seen, has clear and set procedures for reacting to hijackings or aircraft anomalies and would have had open lines to the Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD throughout. Only then did the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld appear and he was in the building from about the time that Flight 11, the first hijacked plane, was leaving its gate at Boston Logan. More about Rumsfeld shortly, but let us stay with General Myers because this guy really is something else. You may have seen him: a grey-haired chap in uniform giving news conferences at the Pentagon while his forces bombed innocent civilians in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Two days after 9/11 Myers appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that confirmed his appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Committee Chairman Senator Carl Levin questioned him about what had happened while the attacks were taking place: Levin: Was the Defense Department contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any other agency after the first two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center, prior to the time that the Pentagon was hit? Myers: Sir, I don't know the answer to that question. I can get that for you, for the record. Levin: Thank you. Did the Defense Department take - or was the Defense Department asked to take action against any specific aircraft? Myers: Sir, we were ..."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 245 Levin: ... And did you take action against - for instance, there have been statements that the aircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania was shot down. Those stories continue to exist. Myers: Mr Chairman, the armed forces did not shoot down any aircraft. When it became clear what the threat was, we did scramble fighter aircraft, AWACS, radar aircraft and tanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other aircraft showed up in the FAA system that were hijacked. But we never actually had to use force. Levin: Was that order that you just described given before or after the Pentagon was struck? Do you know? Myers: That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pentagon was struck. 10 Well, well, well. The highest-ranking military man in America, third only in military authority to the President and the Defense Secretary, and himself a former Commander of NORAD, does not know two days after 9/11 if his own Defense Department was contacted by the FAA or the FBI or any other agency after the first two hijacked aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center and before the Pentagon was hit? You mean he didn't ask at any time after he claims to have rushed to his \"battle station\", the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, where they would have known everything that had happened? What utter tripe. He knew exactly the procedure and lines of communications as both the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former head of NORAD. He knew that the Defense Department, NORAD, and the FAA work closely in hijack situations and that the Pentagon would have been notified before the first plane crashed, never mind after the first two had done so. He knew that fighters are deployed as a matter of course to seek out rogue aircraft. General Myers you are a liar and the question that follows is why are you lying? Myers says that \"to his knowledge\" no order was given to scramble jets in response to the attacks until after the Pentagon was hit. \"To his knowledge\"? You mean he didn't ask that question either when he \"ran\" to the Pentagon or for two days afterwards? In that ti me no one told him? This question of whether jets were indeed scrambled before the Pentagon was struck is interesting because not only did Myers say that to his knowledge this was the case, this appeared to be NORAD's position for several days also, although NORAD spokesman Barry Venable says this is not the case and sent me an Associated Press report of September 11th in which NORAD spokesman Colonel Mike Perini is quoted as saying \"NORAD controllers did track one of the hijacked planes, but it crashed into the World Trade Center even as fighters were scrambling.\" However, other NORAD spokesmen said the very opposite, as did General Myers. Two Cape Cod pilots, named only as Duff and Nasty, spoke to the BBC programme Clear The Skies, which slavishly and unquestioningly repeated the official story from start to finish. The pilots said they did scramble to New York, but could not get there in time."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"246 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Cue Dan The \"we did scramble planes\" story only began to circulate after a report by Dan Rather, the Council on Foreign Relations member and CBS News \"anchor\". Rather is the man who told talk show host David Letterman: \"George Bush is the President. He makes the decisions. Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me where.\" 11 It was Rather who announced to the nation on September 14th that jets had been scrambled while quoting no sources. From this \"Rather exclusive\" the \"we scrambled jets, but they were just too late\" story became the official history. In fact on September 12th, Rather himself had asked the CBS Military Consultant, Colonel Mitch Mitchell, why the Pentagon didn't have a system in which fighters were used to defend against attacks like 9/11. 12 Rather's revelations that jets were deployed on September 11th before the Pentagon was hit came the day after the disastrous testimony of General Myers to the Senate Armed Forces Committee in which he had made the shocking statement that no fighters had been ordered to intercept the first three hijacked airliners over a period of nearly an hour and a half. Myers made no mention of planes scrambling from Otis or Langley, the CIA Air Force base where he was stationed for three years in the late 1980s. Then, hey presto, the following day the scrambled fighter jets story suddenly appeared on CBS. Dan Rather said that night: \"CBS News has learned the FAA alerted US Air Defense units of a possible hijacking at 8.38 Tuesday morning, and six minutes later, at 8.44, two F -15s received a scramble order at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. But two minutes later, at 8.46, American Airlines Flight 11, the first hijacked jet, slammed into the World Trade Center. Six minutes later, at 8.52, the F -15s were airborne and began racing towards New York City, but the fighters were still 70 miles away when the second hijacked jet, United Airlines Flight 175, hit the second Trade Center tower. Shortly after that blast, the F -15s reached Manhattan and began flying air cover missions over the city. \"But to the south, a new danger and a new response. At 9.30, three F -16s were l aunched out of Langley Air Force base in Virginia, 150 miles [130] south of Washington. But just seven minutes later, at 9.37, American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. The F-16s arrived in Washington just before 10am and began flying cover over the nation's capital.\" 13 The contradictions can be clearly observed in two reports in the Boston Globe j ust four days apart. On Saturday, September 15th, reporter Glen Johnson highlighted the opposing accounts of CBS and NORAD. 14 After repeating Rather's CBS \"exclusive\" the night before, he writes that NORAD at this stage still denied scrambling any jets before the Pentagon was attacked, even though a NORAD spokesman, Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder, said they \"routinely\" intercept aircraft. Go figure. The Globe quoted Snyder as saying: \"We scramble aircraft to respond to any aircraft that we consider a potential threat. The hijacked aircraft"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 247 were normal, scheduled commercial aircraft on approved flight plans and we only had 10 minutes prior notice to the first attack, which unfortunately was not enough notice.\" 15 But he also confirmed that none were scrambled for the next hour either! The Globe story says: \" ... Snyder, the NORAD spokesman ... said the command did not immediately scramble any fighters even though it was alerted to a hijacking 10 minutes before the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles, slammed into the first World Trade Center tower at 8.45am Tuesday. \"Never before had a hijacked airliner been steered into a skyscraper, Snyder noted, in trying to explain the lack of immediate response. \"The spokesman said the fighters remained on the ground until after the Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77 at 9.40am, during which time the second trade center tower was struck by United Airlines Flight 175, which also originated in Boston and was destined for Los Angeles. \"By that time, military authorities realized the scope of the attack, Snyder said, and finally ordered the jets aloft.\" 16 Vice President Cheney was still telling this same story on September 16th on the NBC show Meet the Press when he said it was Bush who personally made the decision to send up interceptors and he suggested this was only done after the Pentagon was hit. 17 How does that square with having fighters in the air heading for hijacked airliners before that time? 18 But then suddenly the story changed, new song sheets all round at Cheyenne Mountain and the Pentagon. By September 19th, eight days after 9/11, Glen Johnson and the Boston Globe were now reporting a very different version of events from NORAD. Johnson wrote that: \"Two fighter jets dispatched from Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod had closed to within 71 miles of New York last week when the second of two hijacked airliners slammed into the World Trade Center towers, the military confirmed Tuesday. \"Similarly, two F16 fighters that had scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia streaked toward Washington as a third airliner bore in on the Pentagon, but both were still about 12 minutes away when the commandeered plane struck the nation's military headquarters.\" 19 This timeline, provided by NORAD, had miraculously changed. As Johnson rightly pointed out: \"The account contradicted earlier statements from a defense command spokesman and the incoming chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff [General Myers]. Both said the military did not launch its planes until after the Pentagon had been hit.\" Now a \"different defense command spokesman\", Army Major Barry"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"248 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Venable, said the previous statements were based on \"inaccurate information\". 20 I met Glen Johnson in Boston and he told me he had called the public affairs office at Otis Air Force Base to ask them to confirm that they did scramble planes that morning, but they refused to comment for reasons of \"operational security\" even though their bosses at NORAD had now issued a press release saying that they had. Johnson told me that eventually they would not return his calls. What goes on? I asked NORAD if I could speak with the pilots of the planes that were said to have been scrambled from Otis, but I was told they had \"elected not to speak with the media \" . 21 They had no problem, however, speaking with the BBC programme Clear The Skies that unquestioningly repeated the official line and enjoyed great cooperation and access to Cheyenne Mountain and other military establishments as a result. I am not saying that the Otis and Langley jets were not scrambled, albeit way too late, but the blatant contradictions in the official story are constant and obvious. Anyway, even according to this new timeline of NORAD and the Pentagon, no fighter jet got within 100 miles of even the fourth aircraft, Flight 93, before it crashed in Pennsylvania. Johnson highlights the obvious point that these \"scrambled\" jets flew to their targets at well below their potential speed. Why? We had the same contradictions with Flight 93 almost two hours after the problem was first identified with Flight 11. Major General Paul Weaver, director of the Air National Guard, said that \"No Air National Guard or other military planes were scrambled to chase the fourth hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 93.\" 22 This is a staggering statement in itself. But Rumsfeld's Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was quoted in the Boston Herald telling a very different story. He said that \"... the Air Force was tracking the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania on Tuesday after other airliners slammed into the Pentagon and World Trade Center and had been in a position to bring it down if necessary\" . 23 The whole official story is a mess. During his \"evidence\" to the Senate Committee on September 13th, General Myers was questioned by Senator Bill Nelson, who clearly exposed how ridiculous the earlier explanations had been: Nelson: The second World Trade tower was hit shortly after 9am. And the Pentagon was hit approximately 40 minutes later. That's approximately. You would know specifically what the timeline was. The crash that occurred in Pennsylvania after the Newark westbound flight was turned around 180 degrees and started heading back to Washington was approximately an hour after the World Trade Center second explosion. You said earlier in your testimony that we had not scrambled any military aircraft until after the Pentagon was hit. And so, my question would be: why? Myers: I think I had that right, that it was not until then. I'd have to go back and review the exact timelines. [He thinks that's right?] Nelson: Perhaps we want to do this in our session, in executive [secret] session. But my question is an obvious one for not only this committee, but for the executive branch and the military establishment. If we knew that there was a general threat on terrorist"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 249 activity, which we did, and we suddenly have two trade towers in New York being obviously hit by terrorist activity, of commercial airliners taken off course from Boston to Los Angeles, then what happened to the response of the defense establishment once we saw the diversion of the aircraft headed west from Dulles turning around 180 degrees and, likewise, in the aircraft taking off from Newark and, in flight, turning 180 degrees? That's the question. I leave it to you as to how you would like to answer it. But we would like an answer. Myers: You bet. I spoke, after the second tower was hit, I spoke to the commander of NORAD, General Eberhart. And at that point, I think [think?] the decision was at that point to start launching aircraft. [Pardon? In his interview with Armed Forces Radio and Television he said that when he came out of his meeting on Capitol Hill with Senator Max Cleland he was told of the second plane crashing into the WTC and that the Pentagon had just been hit. Only then, he said, did he talk to Eberhart. Myers is changing his accounts in response to Nelson's questions as they expose the inexplicable non-reaction of NORAD and the Pentagon. What Myers is therefore saying here again is that no planes were scrambled until after the Pentagon was hit.] Myers: One of the things you have to understand, senator, is that in our posture right now, that we have many fewer aircraft on alert than we did during the height of the Cold War. And so, we've got just a few bases around the perimeter of the United States. [What about the fighters a minute's flying time from Washington at Andrews AFB, which were deployed after the Pentagon was hit?] Myers: So it's not just a question of launching aircraft, it's launching to do what? You have to have a specific threat. We're pretty good if the threat's coming from outside. We're not so good if the threat's coming from inside. [Two planes have hit the WTC and another hijacked aircraft is heading for Washington and he says you have to have a \"specific threat\" before scrambling fighters? And \"launching to do what?\" Launching to do what they do every week of the year and as a former commander of NORAD he well knows that. Why were planes not deployed over Washington as soon as the World Trade Center was attacked? If it was felt right to do that after the Pentagon was hit why not before?] Myers: I n this case, if my memory serves me - and I'll have to get back to you for the record - my memory says that we had launched on the one that eventually crashed in Pennsylvania. I mean, we had gotten somebody close to it, as I recall. I'll have to check that out. [Remember this is the top-ranking uniformed military officer in America speaking.] I do not recall if that was the case for the one that had taken off from Dulles. But part of it is just where we are positioned around this country to do that kind of work because that was never - it goes back to Senator Collins' issue. Is this one of the things that we'll worry about. You know, what's next? But our posture today is not one of the many sites and the many tens of aircraft on alert. We just have a handful today."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"250 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Let us not forget that General Myers said that he headed straight for the command centre in the Pentagon after he came out of his meeting on Capitol Hill. The idea that he did not know that morning, never mind two days later, what fighter jets had been, or not been, scrambled is simply laughable. Of course he knew and what he said until he was faced with uncomfortable questions is that they did not scramble jets until the Pentagon was hit. When you have someone presenting such a travesty of the truth and dithering around unable to answer the most basic of questions - answers he would clearly have known - the alarm bells begin to explode. Later, Senator Nelson emphasises his point again to the committee: \" Mr Chairman, may I, just for the record? Commenting from CNN on the timeline, 9.03 i s the correct time that the United Airlines flight crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center; 9.43 is the time that American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. And 10.10am is the time that United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. So that was 40 minutes between the second tower being hit and the Pentagon crash. And it is an hour and seven minutes until the crash occurred in Pennsylvania.\" 24 NORAD or snorad? General Ralph Eberhart, Commander in Chief of NORAD and Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain, appeared on October 25th 2001 before the Senate Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing on the Role of Defense Department in Homeland Security. By now the new song sheets had been circulated all round. Eberhart said that the Federal Aviation Administration did not notify NORAD or the Department of Defense that Flight 77 was \"probably hijacked\" until 9.24am, even though it had changed course and turned back at about 8.55 - after the first plane had already crashed into the World Trade Center. So the plane was \"probably hijacked\"? Can it get any sillier? Eberhart said: \"I show it as 9.24 that we were notified, and that's the first notification that we received. I do not know, sir, why it took that amount of time for FAA. I hate to say it, but you'll have to ask FAA.\" He was asked if they had now improved the communication system: \"Sir, I assure you that we have, and we practice this daily now, and now it takes about one minute from the time that FAA sees some sort of discrepancy on their radar scope or detects a discrepancy in terms of their communication before they notify NORAD. So that certainly has been fixed. 1 think at that time, the FAA was still thinking that if they saw a problem it was a problem that was a result of a mechanical failure or some sort of crew deviation. They weren't thinking hijacking. Today, the first thing they think is hijacking, and we respond accordingly.\" 25"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 251 You can see from the evidence presented in the last chapter about the normal reaction procedures of the FAA and NORAD before September 11th that we are being seriously misled here. If you look at what happened to those planes it was clear to air traffic controllers that the aircraft were not suffering a \"mechanical failure or some sort of crew deviation\" and so why is Eberhart talking such nonsense? Senator Warner asked Eberhart if the FAA and NORAD had not rehearsed the possibilities of an aircraft being seized by terrorists. Eberhart replied: .. although we practice this, day in and day out, the FAA sees on their scopes scores of problems that are a result of mechanical problems, switch errors, pilot errors, et cetera, and that's what they think when they see this\". Oh do come on. Contact was lost with the cockpits, transponders were turned off, there were massive changes of course, and planes were crashing into buildings. Then we are told there were calls from passengers on the planes and \"terrorists\" heard in the cockpits. Nothing to worry about, Ralph, must be a mechanical fault. Note also that he says they \"practice this, day in and day out ... \" using the pre- September 11th tense if you read the sentence. Eberhart continued: \"Although we have exercised this, we have practiced it, in most cases it's a hijacking l i ke most of the hijackings, all of the hijackings I'm aware of, where we have plenty of ti me to react, we get on the wing, and we follow this airplane to where it lands and then the negotiations start. We were not thinking a missile - an airborne missile that was going to be used as a target - a manned missile if you will. \"And in most cases when we practice this, regrettably we practiced it - the origin of this flight was from overseas and we did not have the time-distance problems that we had on that morning. We had plenty of time to react. We were notified that for sure there was a hijacking and we were notified that they were holding a gun to the pilot's head and telling him to fly toward New York City or Washington, DC. So that's how we had practiced this, sir. \"I certainly wish we had practiced it differently, but I really think that, for sure in the first two instances, and probably in the third, the time and distance would not have allowed us to get an airplane to the right place at the right time.\" 26 What is this man saying? His operation has access to the most sophisticated tracking and surveillance technology on earth - and in space - known to man. Two planes hit the World Trade Center and he claims they don't have the time to intercept a plane that turned back 45 minutes before it struck the Pentagon? He says that they \"were not thinking a missile - an airborne missile that was going to be used as a target - a manned missile if you will\", but two such \"missiles\" had already crashed into the World Trade Center before the non-reaction to Flight 77 in Washington by the FAA-NORAD system. Then out came the song sheet when"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"252 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Senator Wayne Allard asked him if they had aircraft \"at least up in the air with the second plane to hit the twin towers\". Eberhart replied, \"Yes sir.\" The following exchange then took place: Allard: And so what I'm interested in knowing is, what was the process there and then, how was that followed-up with the other aircraft that you identified that were coming or heading toward Washington, and how you responded? And how was the FAA interacting with NORAD in that whole situation, starting with that first plane that you deployed heading toward New York City? Eberhart: Yes, sir. The first flight I think was American Flight 11. [He thinks?] The FAA, once they notified us and we issued a scramble order almost simultaneously to the first crash, tragically. That flight of two out of Otis Air Force Base, out of Cape Cod ... Allard: Let me understand - so right at the time the first aircraft was hitting the twin towers, you were being notified by FAA that you had another plane headed toward the towers, you just routinely brought another aircraft ... Eberhart: No, they notified us of the first hijacking just about the time that that airplane was hitting the tower. Allard: OK. Eberhart: And at that time, we issued a scramble order for the two F-15s out of Otis Air Force Base [even though NORAD was denying this for a week]. We continued to send those airplanes toward New York City because initially, as we worked with the FAA, we weren't sure if that was the hijacked airplane [a ludicrous statement]. I mean, I hate to admit this, but I'm sitting there hoping that someone has made a mistake; there has been an accident; that this isn't the hijacked airplane, because there is confusion. We were told it was a light commuter airplane. It didn't look like that was caused by a light commuter airplane. [With NORAD's technology they would have known exactly what it was, so why is he saying this?] So we were still trying to sort this out, so we're moving the two F-15s and we continue to move them. They're flying toward New York City. In fact, they are eight minutes away from New York City when the second crash occurs. We didn't turn around. We didn't send them back. Allard: They hadn't made a sighting of that ... Eberhart: Again, it's time and distance. It took them only six minutes to get airborne. [The US Air Force claims a potential response time of 2.5 minutes from scramble to 29,000 feet.] Once we told them to get airborne, it took them six minutes to get airborne. I think this talks about the professionalism and training of these individuals.

Eberhart: During that time, yes, we were notified, and again we'll provide the exact time li ne for the record. Allard: I' m not interested in exact time lines as much as I am just how the FAA reacted with NORAD during this time period. And then you had the other two planes heading out. Then FAA continued to notify NORAD that you had two other potential hijackings, these headed for Washington; is that correct? Eberhart: Yes, sir. The initial hijacking of the one, I think [think?] i t's 77 that crashed i nto the Pentagon, we were working that with the FAA and we launched the airplanes out of Langley Air Force Base as soon as they notified us about hijacking. At that time it took those airplanes, two F-16s, again, six minutes to get airborne. They were approximately 13 minutes away from Washington, DC, when that tragic crash occurred. Six minutes to get airborne, but still 13 minutes to it. I don't want to worry you, but this guy is the head of the operation that is supposed to protect the United States from attacks from air and space. Better get that shelter dug smartish. Eberhart also revealed that NORAD helped to provide the radars used by the FAA to track aircraft in US airspace and that NORAD has \"moved manpower on the order of about 200 people over the years to the FAA to operate these radars\". I wonder if any NORAD staff were on FAA duty that day? We can't know because no one is saying and if they did, would you believe them? Eberhart also said that he could not discuss in an open session who had the authority to order a commercial plane to be shot down, even though the White House had confirmed it was the President before 9 / 11 and that the head of NORAD and a list of other named military men could now issue such an order. Oh, by the way, at the end of Senator Allard's questioning in which Eberhart's answers were pathetic to anyone who has looked at what should have happened on 9/11, the Senator said: \"Well, I just want to thank you and your people for, I know, I think a tremendous effort in light of some totally unexpected circumstances. And at least, I, for one, appreciate, you know, the readiness that was displayed.\" I know, incredible isn't it? But these are the people running our world. Where was Rumsfeld? OK, we have established where General Myers was that morning - nowhere to be seen. But what about the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the number two in the United States military command structure? It turns out he was working on the east side of the Pentagon from before the time that Flight 11 took off from Boston. He told the CNN talk show Larry King Live on December 5th that he was in his office and was given no warning whatsoever that Flight 77 was heading for Washington before it crashed into the Pentagon. 27 Can the official story get any more"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"254 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. insane? Unfortunately it can. This is the headquarters of the US military with open lines to NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain with all its satellites, AWACS and ground- based surveillance, and with open lines by now with the FAA. Two planes had already crashed into the World Trade Center and the US Defence Secretary was given no warning that an aircraft was about to crash into the building he was in, albeit a long, long, way from impact? This is an extraordinary statement and more transparent tosh. Larry King failed to ask a single question about the Defense Secretary's ridiculous story, but that, of course, will surprise no one. Rumsfeld related to King that earlier that morning he had told a congressional delegation in his office at the Pentagon: \"Sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months, there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people, again, how important it is to have a strong, healthy Defense Department that contributes - that underpins peace and stability in our world. And that is what underpins peace and stability. \"28 How prophetic. Then came another outrageous statement that Rumsfeld made to King. He said that during this meeting in his office ... \"... someone walked in and handed me a note that said that a plane had just hit the World Trade Center. And we adjourned the meeting. And I went in to get my CIA briefing right next door here, and the whole building shook within 15 minutes. And it was a jarring thing.\" 29 Now hold on here. The first plane hit the World Trade Center at about 8.46. The Pentagon wasn't hit until around 9.38. Yet Rumsfeld tells King he was handed a note saying a plane had \"just\" hit the WTC and within 15 minutes Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon? Are we being asked to believe that the Defense Secretary wasn't told about the first plane hitting the WTC until some 40 minutes after it happened when he is sitting in his own office at the Pentagon all this time? This is the only way that the \"within 15 minutes\" can be explained. Most of America and hundreds of millions across the world were watching events unfold live on television before gam and yet the Defense Secretary, number two only to the President in the US military command, didn't know until about 9.20? Where does that leave the \"just\" hit the World Trade Center in the Rumsfeld story and why was he not told about the second hit on the WTC at the same time? Rumsfeld's own Department of Defense manual says: \"In the event of a hijacking, the [National Military Command Center at the Pentagon] will be notified by the most expeditious means by the FAA. The NMCC will, with the exception of immediate responses ... forward requests for DOD assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.\"\" Given this procedure alone the Secretary of Defense would surely have been told immediately the first plane hit the north tower - 50 to 55 minutes before the Pentagon was hit, not 15. In fact, he would have had to be told under the Pentagon's own procedures i mmediately it was known that the first plane had been hijacked. That would have been around 8.20 - an hour and 20 minutes before the Pentagon was hit. The lies are j ust so blatant."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 255 The Washington Post reported that after Rumsfeld was informed of the World Trade Center attack by his Chief of Staff he \"stayed in his office on the east side of the Pentagon for a scheduled CIA briefing\" - note \"scheduled\" - while \"several of his senior aides rushed to the Pentagon's command center deep within the five- sided complex, where a crisis action center [no-action center] was being set up.\" 31 If you only believe the ludicrous official version that Pentagon officials were given 12 minutes' warning of the plane heading their way, why would no one tell the Defense Secretary before he felt his \"jarring thing\"? And, according to the official story from Rumsfeld's own military, jets were dispatched from Langley at 9.30 to intercept the plane and yet Rumsfeld and others in the Pentagon had no warning that the building was likely to be hit? Nowhere, but nowhere, do their pieces fit and there is a very good reason for that. It's a pack of lies. I contacted the Pentagon with the following list of questions, but officials chose not to answer them. 1. With the capability of United States air defence, how can a hijacked airliner, Flight 77, be allowed to fly for 45 minutes towards Washington, with communication lost with air traffic control and the transponder turned off, approach a No Fly Zone and hit your headquarters without any challenge whatsoever? 2. Why was the Defense Secretary Mr Rumsfeld unaware that the plane was approaching until the Pentagon was actually struck? 3. Why was Secretary Rumsfeld not told of the first plane striking the WTC until around 15 minutes before Flight 77 struck the Pentagon (thus about 9.20am to 9.25am)? Why was he not told at this time that a second plane had struck the World Trade Center? 4. Why was Richard Myers, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not informed that two planes had struck the WTC and that another was heading for Washington while he was in a scheduled meeting on Capitol Hill and available throughout? Why did he only learn of what was happening when he emerged from the meeting to be told that the Pentagon had been hit? Is there not a constant communication link between the Chairman and the Pentagon? 5. Why were the ground to air defences at the Pentagon and the White House not activated when Flight 77 approached? 6. Why is there no survelliance camera footage of Flight 77 from much closer to the point of impact? The pictures released by the Pentagon seem to be a long way away for a building that must be guarded by a very large number of cameras, many of them looking outwards."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"256 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. Dan Philbin from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) Directorate for Public Inquiry and Analysis merely referred me to transcripts of Pentagon press briefings on the Internet that did not address these questions.\" I told him so and asked for direct answers, but he did not respond. Mind you, if I were the Pentagon I wouldn't want to be faced with answering these questions either because to do so credibly is simply not possible. Where was Bush? So to George W. Bush. Where was he when his country needed a decisive President? He was not in Washington that morning, which doesn't surprise me at all. Instead, as I have already mentioned, he was back in brother Jeb's state of Florida for a pre- publicised photo opportunity at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota. What he did that morning, and when and how he heard of Flight 11 striking the World Trade Center, depends very much on which official account you want to hear. There are several from people like Bush, Cheney and Ari Fleischer, the President's press secretary. Sonya Ross, an Associated Press reporter, said she knew of the first crash even before Bush had reached the school that morning: \" My cell phone rang as President Bush's motorcade coursed toward Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. A colleague reported that a plane had crashed i nto the World Trade Center in New York. No further information. \"I called the AP desk in Washington, seeking details. Same scant information. But I knew it had to be grim. I searched for a White House official to question, but none was on hand until 9.05am.\" 33 If her office knew and enough time had passed for them to call her on a cellphone, Bush must have known well before he arrived at the school that the aircraft had crashed into the WTC, and he must have known even earlier that there was a hijack in progress on Flight 11. Contact was lost with the aircraft at 8.13am and the President travels with a staff that is in instant contact with the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon, which coordinates with NORAD, the FAA and the government intelligence network. John Cochran, an ABC journalist, was reporting Bush's visit to Florida that day. He told Peter Jennings on ABC: \"Peter, as you know, the President's down in Florida talking about education. He got out of his hotel suite this morning, was about to leave, reporters saw the White House Chief of Staff, Andy Card, whisper into his ear. The reporter said to the President, `Do you know what's going on in New York?' He said he did, and he said he will have something about it l ater. His first event is about half an hour at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida.\" 34 How do you explain the report that when Card whispered in the President's ear outside his hotel that Bush \"did not respond\"? Would he not have been utterly shocked and insisted on cancelling the school visit to handle the situation? After all,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 257 at that time he was the only one who could give permission for a civilian airliner to be shot down. How could he be ready to react to events sitting in a classroom listening to children reading? One reason why someone would not be stunned to hear such information, of course, is if they already knew what was going to happen. At the very least from about 8.46am when Flight 11 crashed, the secret service that looks after the safety of the President had \"open lines\" with the Federal Aviation Administration. This was confirmed by Vice President Dick Cheney on NBC's Meet the Press. 35 In truth, the open lines would surely have been activated earlier than that when Flight 11 began to act very strangely and dramatically change course. The Bush team in Florida knew precisely what the FAA knew by that time - indeed suspected from about 8.20 - that Flight 11 had been hijacked. It would have been the most basic security response to keep the President away from a pre-arranged, publicised, event at a school, especially as it is only five miles from the Sarasota- Bradenton International Airport. Especially after Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center the thought that the President could be a target of a similar attack must have occurred to them, yet there appears to have been no discussion about the President's security given these circumstances and off he went to the school as planned. Did they know something we didn't? \"There's one terrible pilot\" Despite the eye-witness reports of when Bush must have known that Flight 11 was in trouble, he completely contradicted this - and the earlier accounts of his own officials - in an extraordinary performance on December 4th at a \"town meeting\" at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, where he was answering non-challenging questions from a sycophantic audience. I actually watched this happen live on CNN in a hotel bar. As I sipped my beer and despaired at the hero worship being enjoyed by a village idiot, Bush made a startling statement about September 11th. For the next two days I scanned the newspapers, the Internet \"news\" sites, including CNN, but there was no mention of the amazing statement he had made. Weeks later a Belgian visitor to my website sent me the words that Bush had said. They were posted on the White House website, hidden away in the full and long transcript of the meeting.\" Bush was talking about what happened on September 11th and how he heard of the atrocities in New York, in answer to a question from a young boy called Jordan: \" Well, Jordan, you're not going to believe what state I was in when I heard about the terrorist attack [well it didn't show]. I was in Florida. And my Chief of Staff, Andy Card - actually, I was in a classroom talking about a reading program that works. I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower - the TV was obviously on. And I used to fly, myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot. I said it must have been a horrible accident. But I was whisked off there; I didn't have much ti me to think about it. And I was sitting in the classroom, and Andy Card, my Chief of Staff, who is sitting over here, walked in and said, 'A second plane has hit the tower, America is under attack.\"'"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"A few facts. There was no live television coverage of the first plane hitting the tower - how could there be? The recorded footage of the first crash did not air until long after Bush went into the classroom where he was told of the second crash by Card (Figure 18). The l i ve pictures were of the second plane when the television networks were already broadcasting shots of the burning north tower. How could he, Figure 18: \" Mr President, America is under attack.\" therefore, claim to have seen the first \"OK Andy, as soon as I've heard what happens to this goat, 0/ be right out.\" \t plane strike? This is simply not possible, so what on earth is he talking about? What about his reaction of \"there's one terrible pilot\"? Uh? A passenger jet crashes into a 110-storey building full of people and all the President of the United States can say is \"there's one terrible pilot\"! We have already seen that Bush must have known about the first crash before he even arrived at the school and he wants us to believe that the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief of US forces and \"homeland\" defence, would not be told before that time how contact with Flight 11 had been lost, its transponder had been turned off, and that it had veered sharply off-course? Contact was lost at 8.13 and the plane did not hit the north tower until about 8.46. The Federal Aviation Administration, NORAD and the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon were tracking the plane from soon after contact ceased. Bush, remember, said before leaving his hotel for the school that he would \"have something\" later about what was happening in New York and the Associated Press reporter said she knew of the first crash before Bush had even arrived at the school. Yet he says that he saw the plane crash on a television at the school (not possible) and his reaction was: \"I used to fly myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot. I said it must have been a horrible accident.\" Lies, lies, lies again. Bush's story is also in direct contradiction to the earlier official version that he was told about Flight 11 in a call from his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice before he went into the classroom.\" This, in turn, contradicts the accounts of reporters who make it clear that Bush must have known what was happening before he arrived at the school. Then, knowing what had happened and knowing the plane had been hijacked, how does the President of the United States react to these monumental events? He walks into a classroom to read to children from the second grade and hear them read him a story about a pet goat! As the children read to him he said: \"Really good readers - whew!\" Bush interrupted at one point, saying, \"This must be Sixth Grade.\" God help us. There has just been a catastrophe in New York, Mr President, involving thousands of people and you know the cause is a hijacked airliner. Hello? When Andrew Card came into the classroom and whispered in his ear that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center and that \"America is under attack\", what"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11 ? \t 259 does the President do then? He continues to sit there listening to a story about a pet goat. If you were writing this as fiction they'd say it was a ridiculous story. Associated Press reported on September 12th: \"In Sarasota, Florida, Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9.05am when his chief of staff Andrew Card whispered into his ear. The president briefly turned somber before he resumed reading. He addressed the tragedy about a half-hour later.\" 38 He \"briefly\" remained somber, or sombre, as we spell it in Britain? He's just been told that a second commercial airliner has struck the World Trade Center. Death and destruction on a massive scale was already obvious and the President knew the first plane had been hijacked before he went into the classroom. Yet he turned \"briefly somber\" before continuing to focus on the adventures of a pet goat. Jenna Heath of Cox Newspapers' Washington Bureau reported that Bush \"did not appear preoccupied\" as he introduced Education Secretary Rod Paige inside the classroom and shook hands with teacher Sandra Kay Daniels. \"There was no sign that [ Condoleezza] Rice had just told Bush about the first attack on New York's World Trade Center during a telephone call,\" Heath wrote. 39 Look at his reaction when Card \"whispered in his ear\" before he left his hotel? \"He did not respond,\" said witnesses. Is this really a natural response from a man who has just been told of such events in the country he is supposed to be leading? Or is it the response of someone who knew full well what was going on and why? Bush told the Florida town meeting on December 4th: \"But I knew I needed to act. I knew that if the nation's under attack, the role of the Commander-in-Chief is to respond forcefully to prevent other attacks from happening. And so, I've talked to the Secretary of Defense; one of the first acts I did was to put our military on alert.\" 40 Bush says he knew he needed to act, but the indisputable truth is that he didn't. What's all this about calling Defense Secretary Rumsfeld? When did he do that? Rumsfeld told Larry King that even though he was in his office in the Pentagon he didn't know anything was happening until he was handed a note while meeting a congressional delegation in his office little more than 15 minutes before the Pentagon was struck at about 9.38. We are being told here that although the President knew well before gam, the Defense Secretary was not told until at least half an hour later even though he was in the Pentagon. Wherever you look there is a deluge of lies and contradictions. Bush says that he put the military on alert, but he could not have done this until he was finished with the goat story and left the classroom shortly before 9.30 - more than 40 minutes after the first plane hit. As I mentioned, the official tale (official version 99933/S11/666/update/triplicate) is that Bush was taken to a private room before he went into the classroom and spoke on the phone with his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who told him about Flight 11. We are told that at this point the crash of Flight 11 could have been"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"260 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. considered just a \"terrible accident\" - an obvious lie. If Bush talked to his National Security Adviser before gam, how come Defense Secretary Rumsfeld says he didn't know anything for another 25 minutes? Why was Rice not in immediate contact with Rumsfeld? Why wasn't the President? Why wasn't anyone? It was 9.30 - 26 minutes after hearing of the second crash - before Bush went into the school library to announce: \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center, in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I am going to conduct a full-scale investigation and hunt down and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand.\" No, Mr Bush, you were about to name the patsy and the target that suited the agenda of those who control you. The \"folks\" are much closer to home, as you well know. The lie about scare force one Bush was taken to Air Force One, the presidential plane, and even the official story says that he did not call Vice President Cheney and put the US military on high alert status until at least 10am, by which time the Pentagon had been hit. Bush headed for Barksdale Air Force base, Louisiana, and the US Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force base in Nebraska, and did not arrive at the White House, via the Andrews Air Force Base, until shortly before 7pm. This was more than ten hours after the first strike on the World Trade Center. When understandable questions were being asked about why Bush did not head straight for Washington to lead his country at such a terrible time, the White House said that they had received a phone call giving a secret code to say that Air Force One was the next target. No they didn't, that was yet another lie. John Ashcroft, the Attorney General and the man who delivers \"justice\" to others, also said the \"government has credible evidence that the White House and Air Force One were targets\". 41 Lie again. Reports were circulated through the news agencies on September 12th that quoted a White House spokesman as saying: \"There was real and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were targets of terrorist attacks and that the plane that hit the Pentagon was headed for the White House.\" Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, confirmed this the same afternoon. The Secret Service had \"specific and credible information\" that the White House and Air Force One were potential targets, he said. Bush's chief political strategist, the Enron shareholder Karl Rove, was quoted the following day as confirming that the threat came in language that proved the terrorists had knowledge of the President's \"procedures and whereabouts\". 42 So why did they allow him to attend a publicised appearance at a school in the circumstances of that morning and why, if there was a specific threat to Air Force One, was Bush taken straight to the airport to take off in that plane after he had finished with the pet goat story? Maureen Dowd wrote in the New York Times that Karl Rove had \"called around town, trying to sell reporters the story.\" 43"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11? \t 261 But two weeks later the White House was forced to back down on the whole fantasy and on September 25th the CBS Evening News reported that the call \"simply never happened\". 44 Most newspapers did not even report this fantastic exposure of the lies spewed out daily by the Bush administration, and the Washington Post only ran the story on an inside page. It was this same White House press spokesman, Ari Fleischer, who repeated the lies about Air Force One, which told us how Flight 77 was heading for the White House before it \"veered off\" and aimed at the Pentagon. Vice President Cheney said the same on NBC's Meet the Press. He confirmed that the plane was being tracked (so why no response?) and \"when it entered the danger zone and looked like it was headed for the White House was when they grabbed me and evacuated me to the basement...\" 45 They waited, he claims, until the aircraft was \"in the danger zone\" before evacuating the Vice President when they had been tracking a hijacked plane's progress towards Washington for some 40 minutes after two planes had already crashed into the World Trade Center. The CBS News Transportation Correspondent Bob Orr reported that the recorded flight path of Flight 77 does not support what Cheney and Fleischer claim: \"Eight minutes before the crash, at 9.30am EDT, radar tracked the plane as it closed to within 30 miles of Washington. Sources say the hijacked jet continued east at a high speed toward the city, but flew several miles south of the restricted airspace around the White House.\" Once again I sent a list of questions to the White House media office relating to these events. They were faxed in May 2002, but they chose not to answer. 1. When did the President know that Flight 11 was in trouble or there could be a problem? When did the FAA, NORAD, and the Pentagon communicate this information to the President's support team in Florida that morning? Would not respond. 2. Why, when he was told of the first plane striking the WTC, did the President continue with his engagement and go into a reading class at the Emma Booker School? Would not respond. 3. Why when told by Andrew Card in the classroom that a second plane had struck the WTC and that \"America is under attack\", did he continue to stay in the classroom for some time? Would not respond. 4. When did the President put the United States military on high alert? Would not respond."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"262 \t This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it any time we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. 5. Why did the President not go back to Washington immediately when we now know that the story of the telephone warning that Air Force One was the next target never happened? Would not respond. 6. Why did the President tell a public meeting that he saw the first plane strike the WTC and said \"There's one a terrible pilot\", when he could not possibly have seen that happen before he entered the classroom? That footage was not aired until much later. Would not respond. 7. Why was the President not considered to be in danger when the attacks began, and thus removed from the school and a pre-announced visit when the school was only a short distance from an airport? Would not respond. Why no evacuation? Another piece of criminal negligence - in truth more than that - was the failure to evacuate the Pentagon, the White House and other major Washington symbols until the Pentagon was struck. This was despite a warning apparently issued to the Pentagon by the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN, quoting \"Defense Department officials\", said that no action was taken for at least 12 minutes despite warnings that an airliner \"appeared\" to be heading towards Washington.\" (In fact the aircraft must have been tracked heading in that direction for more than 40 minutes.) American Forces Press Service reported that personnel at the Pentagon realised they could be a target long before they were hit: \"We were watching the World Trade Center on the television,\" said a Navy officer. \"When the second plane deliberately dove into the tower, someone said, 'The World Trade Center is one of the most recognizable symbols of America. We're sitting in a close second.\"' 47 The top people in the Pentagon, apparently, could not see what everyone else could. Or maybe, I would suggest, some of them could see very clearly, but did nothing. Retired General Wesley Clark, a former NATO Supreme Commander, said, \"We've known for some time that some group has been planning this, obviously, we didn't do enough to prepare for such an attack.\" 48 Officials at the Pentagon, quoted by CNN, said, \"no mechanism existed within the US government to notify various departments and agencies under such circumstances\". No mechanism to evacuate the Pentagon with a flying bomb heading in its direction?? In contradiction of this, Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said \"to call for a general evacuation, at that point, it would have been just guessing ... We evacuate when we know something is a real threat to us.\" 49 Clearly something is only considered a \"real threat\" when it smashes into the building. Oh, it was a real threat then; better evacuate, I guess. Newsday reported that many of the building's 20,000 workers were still sitting at their desks when the plane struck, and some said they heard the crash but didn't know the plane had hit the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Centre Disaster • Where were you on 9/11? \t 263 Pentagon until they saw it on TV! 50 \"The first thought everyone had was that it had been a bomb,\" said Victoria Clarke, a spokeswoman for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. 51 Only with a hole in the side of the building and 125 employees and workers dead was the building evacuated followed by the White House, Capitol Hill and elsewhere. None of the Pentagon top brass were killed or injured because they did not work in the part of the building that was struck. General Richard Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had the unbelievable nerve to say at a memorial ceremony for the victims that they were \"serving their country\" in the course of doing their jobs at the Pentagon, \"and on September 11 were called to make the ultimate sacrifice\". 52 Sacrifice, I think, was the only appropriate word. They were allowed to die, as the recorded facts make so plain. All this was coldly calculated by those running the 9/11 operation because the more death and destruction they could cause, the bigger would be the problem, the bigger the reaction and therefore the bigger the solution that could be offered - a war without end and the dismantling of basic freedoms. The families of those who died in the Pentagon have an open and shut case for a lawsuit against the US government for the gross negligence that cost the lives of their loved ones. It is, however, as I continue to stress, far more than \"negligence\" that is behind all this. And where was \"Big Dick\"? Representatives of government, \"security\" agencies and the military at the highest levels constantly lied over and over about what did and did not happen. Which brings me to Dick Cheney. Where was the Vice President all this time? He told the media on September 12th that a clerical secretary watching television in his Washington office alerted him to the attacks. 53 Oh really, Dick. The Cheyenne Mountain official website says of the NORAD Command Center: \"Redundant and survivable communications hotlines connect the Command Center to the Pentagon, White House, US Strategic Command, Canadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa, other aerospace defense system command posts, and major military centers around the world.\" 54 Yet Cheney, sitting in the White House, says he learned of the attacks when a clerical secretary comes in and says, \"Hey, you'll never guess what I've just seen on the telly.\" The whole story is a joke. But look at the common denominator here between Bush, Rumsfeld and Myers, the 1, 2, 3, in the military command structure, and Cheney. Their stories and actions all ensured that they were not in a position to react immediately to events until after the Pentagon was hit. Or rather they had an excuse not to do so. Bush was occupied with the goat story until shortly before the Pentagon was hit and then went straight into another room to make a statement to the media. Rumsfeld gave Larry King a tale that he knew nothing about the World Trade Center until 15 minutes before the Pentagon was hit, and claims no one told him that plane was coming. \"So how could I order a response?\" is the obvious implication. Myers says that he was in a pre-arranged meeting with a senator throughout the period between the first strike on the World Trade Center and the crash, almost an hour later, into the Pentagon. Isn't that all so terribly convenient? Another key question is where was Father George Bush, the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"264 This \"world\" is only an illusion and we can change it anytime we want. It's just a choice right now between fear and love. orchestrator, with Cheney, of the Boy George \"Presidency\"? He admits himself that he was at the White House the night before, but says he flew to St Paul, Minneapolis, the next morning. What time the next morning? The first plane to be hijacked was Flight 11 at about 8.15. Two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center by 9.03 and, if Flight 93 had not been delayed well over half an hour before take-off, it is highly probable that all four aircraft would have hit their targets by around 9.40. What were Father Bush and Cheney doing while all this was going on? Where were the ground-to-air defences? There is one other massive red flag also, which provides yet more confirmation, as if it were needed, that the attacks of September 11th were allowed to happen by the very authorities that are, in retaliation, waging a global war on terrorism. While I was on a speaking tour in Australia a few weeks after 9/11, I was told by a man who is involved with the computer systems of the Australian military that his country's forces were on full alert status immediately the World Trade Center was hit. That makes it more than an hour before America, the target of the attacks, was put on the same status by George Bush once he had finished with the pet goat and arrived at Air Force One. But the Australian contact told me something else. He said that the Australian Parliament building in Canberra is protected from air attack by hidden ground-to-air missiles. He said that the procedure is as follows: when an aircraft enters the protected airspace around the parliament building the pilot is contacted immediately by a computer system that demands he or she punch in a code authorising the plane to fly into that airspace. If this is not done in seconds, the contact told me, the computer launches a missile to blow the plane from the sky. Even at the G-8 Summit in Genoa, Italy, in July 2001 airspace was closed over the city and defended with ground-to-air missiles. My Australian contact said he knew for a fact that the Pentagon and Washington DC in general are defended by an even more sophisticated missile system than Canberra, but works in basically the same way. It is obvious that this would be the case and it has been openly accepted that a ground-to-air system is in place to defend the White House. The Globe and Mail newspaper in Canada provided one of the rare mentions of the Pentagon system. It reported: \"Meanwhile, there was no explanation of how four airliners could be hijacked and flown - in at least two cases hundreds of kilometres and for nearly an hour - without being successfully intercepted. That one ploughed into the Pentagon, supposedly protected by surface-to-air missiles, dramatically demonstrated US vulnerability.\" 55 Why weren't those missiles launched to stop the Pentagon crash? The same reason that the FAA, NORAD and the Defense Department did not scramble fighter jets, or at least not in time. They weren't meant to. An insider speaks After I had originally completed this chapter I came across an investigative website that claims to have conducted a phone interview on December 9th 2001 with a member of the US Air Force based in New York.

What he and others discovered, the website claims he told them, was that the standard response procedures were fully in effect that morning and were followed to the letter as usual by Air Traffic Control and that Air National Guard and Air Force units were alerted immediately it was clear that something was amiss with the four aircraft. But he said that after these alerts and requests for action were received from Air Traffic Control and the FAA, orders from the \"highest level of the executive branch of the federal government were received, demanding that the Air Force stand down and not follow through with established scramble-intercept procedures that morning until further notice\". 56 This Air Force contact was unnamed, but then, to be fair, how could he have been? People will just have to decide for themselves if what he is claimed to have said rings true. But it is a scenario that does fit what happened that morning and makes sense of the apparently nonsensical lack of response. No planes were scrambled to intercept the hijacked planes (either at all or in ti me) and no ground-to-air defences were activated to save the lives of those who died inside the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Some would call this incompetence. But staggering as that alone would be, what happened on September 11th is far more than that. It was calculated mass murder. The first position taken by the authorities is that there was nothing they could have done. That is what they really want you to believe. The second, when that doesn't work, is to let you think they were incompetent. Both positions are designed to hide the truth - the truth that what we are looking at here amid the explosion of lies and diversions is not incompetence at all. This was orchestrated incompetence in which forces at, and behind, the highest levels of the United States government and military were intervening to stop the system working as it normally would. To stop thousands of people going home to their families that September day because it suited the sick agenda for those people to die and for the world to watch it all live on television. But these same forces did not only allow the atrocities to happen. They made them happen, too.
