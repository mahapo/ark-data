Andthe premonitions of the learned beings.It is written in the hearts of our people, thus:We do not require churches - which would only lead us to argue over God. And thethought that white men should rule over nature and change its ways to hisliking, was never understood by the red man.Our belief is that the Great Spirit has created all things. Not just mankind,but all animals, all plants, all rocks, all on Earth and amongst the stars withtrue soul.For us, all life is holy.But. You do not understand our prayers when we address the Sun, Moon, and Winds.You have judged us without understanding, only because our prayers aredifferent.But we are able to live in harmony with all of nature.

But you’re still fucking peasants as far as I can see.John Lennon, Working Class Hero1The FreedomAll matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. We’re all oneconsciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There’s no such thing as death.Life is just a dream.And we are the imagination of ourselves.Bill HicksWorking Class Hero, Apple Records, 1970.Picture #7 [images/img_0007.png]1Chapter 1The Bewildered HerdSo who the hell are you, then? What lies behind those eyes? When you look in themirror, what do you see? Do you see the real you, or what you have beenconditioned to believe is you? The two are so, so, different. One is an infiniteconsciousness capable of being and creating whatever it chooses, the other is anillusion imprisoned by its own perceived and programmed limitations.Which of these “yous” is controlling your life? Infinity or limitation? Selflove or self disdain? Freedom of thought or a prison of the mind?Sadly for the overwhelming majority of people on this planet all but theprivileged few - it is the conditioned mind which prevails. They live theirlives within their programmed limitations of thought, view, and action. It is aworld of I can’ts and I daren’ts and I mustn’ts; of I shoulds and I musts and Iought tos; a world of conforming to what someone else says they must be orshould be. While the real them sees only solutions and opportunities to leam andevolve, the programmed them sees only problems and reasons not to do. They livelife behind bars in a cell of their own making. The world itself reflects thesum total of these billions of individual prisons. The Earth has become a globalAlcatraz, a spinning ball of control and imposition dictated by the few at theexpense of the many. Freedom? Free-what? How do you spell that again? The humanrace has not been free for a very, very long time, well before recorded history.But the trick is to persuade us that we are free - then we won’t do anythingabout the walls that surround us and the warders at the door. Walls? What walls?You’re free! Warders? What warders? You’re free!Yes you are free: you are free to watch television - thirty channels and more ofmindless crap which close down your sense of infinity and fred you illusions ofwhat you should do, be and think. You have the freedom to press the zappa buttonand choose any one of them.Picture #8 [images/img_0008.png]2Oh what a joy to live in the land of freedom. You are free to watch the news andsee journalists and correspondents telling you, mostly without question, theofficial explanation of events - explanations designed to ensure that you seethe world in the desired fashion and react in the desired way. Ladies andgentlemen, repeat after me... I am free... I am free. Yes! yes! yes! You arefree to do as we tell you; free to think as we tell you; free to live as we tellyou. And you are even free to die as we tell you in the wars coldly created todestroy, control and manipulate.The human race is free?No, no, no.The human race is a herd.Here we are, unique, eternal aspects of consciousness with an infinity ofpotential and we have allowed ourselves to become an unthinking, unquestioningblob of conformity and uniformity. A herd. Once we concede to the herd mentalitywe can be controlled and directed by a tiny few. And we are.I was standing in the sunshine one day surrounded by an enormous herd of sheep.The farmer arrived in his track, climbed out, and stood motionless, leaning onhis stick. Immediately a few of the sheep began to walk towards him and withinminutes it was like Exodus. Hundreds of sheep were following those few in front.Any stragglers who didn’t conform to this baa, baa mentality were given a doseof fear from the sheep dog and then they rushed into line also. In aridiculously short time this combination of the baa, baa, and the fear hadrounded up the whole vast herd. All it took was one man doing very little and asheep dog dispensing fear. As I observed this, I thought: “I’m looking at thehuman race here. This is how we are controlled”. We have stopped thinking forourselves and given our minds (power) away. Therefore we follow the one in frontin the most extraordinarily robotic fashion. And we are consumed by fear inevery fibre of our being. Once our fear responses are activated, we rash toconform even if we are aware enough to realise that what we are being asked tothink, do, and say, is a nonsense. These weapons, the baa, baa, and the fear,allow an astonishingly few people to mould and direct the world in their ownperverted image, a process that is leading, unless we wake up and growPicture #9 [images/img_0009.png]3up, towards a world government, army, central bank and currency, and amicrochipped population: in short, the total global control of every man womanand child.While it may appear at first to be incredibly difficult for a relative handfulof people to control the lives of nearly six billion, it is in factcomparatively easy, once you have control of education and the media - thesources of the “information” and mantra messages which bombard the conscious andsubconscious mind from cradle to grave. These messages are not designed toinform, but to direct and condition, to divide and rule. The religious,scientific, political and economic manipulators position themselves between thetruth and the human conscious mind. They are the middlemen and women who seek tokeep out of the public arena the knowledge that would open our minds to our realand infinite potential. We are fed a mental diet of pap and crap designed todiminish our sense of self and close down our consciousness until it becomes apale shadow of what it can be. It becomes a sheep and the sheep become a herd.As someone once said, there are three types of person in the world: a tiny fewwho make things happen; a slightly larger number who watch things happen; andall the rest who go around saying: what’s happening, what’s happening? The truthis denied to people because it will set them free. Instead, those at the peak ofthe religious, scientific, political, and economic empires (the same state ofmind in different clothes) hand down their version of “truth”, a version whichmeans that people must believe whatever they want them to believe. And, to befair, humanity does not have a great record for demanding the truth or searchingfor it. We have developed lazy minds. It’s appropriate that the word ignoranceis an extension of the word ignore. We ignore so much and so we becomeignore-ant.Once you have conditioned one generation to think in the way you require, itbecomes even easier to condition the next generation. You now have theprogrammed parents working unknowingly on your behal{ conditioning theirchildren to accept their own conditioned view of life. Such parents don’t dothis because they are bad people. They do it because they genuinely think theirview is best for their children. But the effect is the same: one programmedgeneration helps to programme the next one because it does not respect anyone’sright to be themselves. Each generation has a right to see life in a way thatmakes sense to them, not their parents, their teachers, or the guy reading thenews. But sadly, people accept without thinking so muchPicture #10 [images/img_0010.png]4that is passed down to them. They don’t ask the most liberating question it ispossible to ask: Why? Why do we do it this way? Why do we believe this or that?Who says? The question “why?” is the driving force behind evolution. When Ispoke in the United States, an American friend told me a story that brilliantlyhighlights what I mean. She said that when she was preparing dinner one day shecut the comers off the ham before putting it in the pan.“Why do you do that? ” her husband asked.“I don’t know - my mother always used to do it. ’’“Why did your mother cut the corners off the ham? ”“I don’t know, she just did - what’s it matter? ”“Ring your mother and ask her why she cut the corners off the ham. ”She rang her mother.“Mum, you know when I was a girl and you used to cut the corners off the ham?Why did you do that? ”“Because my pan was never big enough! ”If her husband had not asked the question “why?”, she would have continued tocut the comers off the ham and her children would quite possibly have done it,too. This is how one generation allows its sense of self to be conditioned byolder generations, parents, teachers and media people. They don’t question why.This sponge mentality and the desire to impose one’s thoughts and beliefs onothers has created an amazingly effective vehicle for the Elite to control thedirection of the world. It is what I have called the Hassle-Free Zone. Everydogma, belief-system, culture, and society has a Hassle-Free Zone. It works likethis: you set limits of acceptable thought, view and behaviour and anyone whosteps outside of those very narrow limits is immediately either ridiculed as“mad” or condemned as “bad”. In my case both! Some people stay within theHassle-Free Zone because they are persuaded that this desperately constrictedview is indeed how life should be lived. But there are very significant numbersof other peoplePicture #11 [images/img_0011.png]5who realise how ridiculous the limits of the Zone are, but the fear of facingridicule or condemnation ensures that they keep their mouths shut and theirheads down. As they say in Japan, the nail that stands out from the rest is thefirst one to be hit. Here again we have the Hassle-Free Zone policed by thosetwin weapons, the baa, baa (those who accept the limitation of conditionedthought and view as their reality) and the fear (those who think differently,but are frightened to say so). This means that great swathes of humanity areliving a lie and denying what they really believe and what they really want todo with their lives. They don the mask. Stand in a crowded street and watch allthose people walking by. You are not looking at the real, infinite them. You arelooking at the mask they project to the world. The mask they believe isacceptable enough to the rest of the prisoners to avoid being ridiculed orcondemned for thinking and acting differently to the demands of the Hassle-FreeZone. It is the fantastic tensions within the psyche caused by this denial whichlie at the heart of most mental, emotional, and therefore physical disease(dis-ease, disharmony) which manifests as illness, depression, suicide, a lackof fulfilment, and “what’s the point?”. This daily “war” in the psyche bringsinto conflict that part of us which recognises our infinity and uniqueness, andthe conscious level which seeks to deny such feelings because it fears theconsequences of expressing uniqueness in a world of programmed uniformity. Thesetwo levels of the psyche are what I term “I Am Me, I Am Free” and “Oh My God”.I Am Me, I Am Free, wishes to express and celebrate its uniqueness. Oh My God,is terrified of what that will mean in daily life. “Oh my God, what will myfamily think if I say what I believe? What about the fellahs at work? And theguys down the bar? They’ll think I’ve gone mad. Oh my God!”If you want to be free, stop living a lie. Stop denying yourself. You are aunique aspect of all that exists, the sum total of all your unique experiencessince you first became cCjnscious an infinity ago. That is a reason to bejoyous. There is no aspect of consciousness in all creation that is like you.You are special, as everyone is equally special. But instead of being joyous andproud of that specialness, we have allowed our uniqueness to become something tofear. Oh my God!Because we fear being ourselves, we are uncomfortable when anyone around usdecides to evacuate the Hassle-Free Zone and express their uniqueness. Theirdash for mental and emotional freedom makes a statement about us and our ownmental and emotional prison. PeoplePicture #12 [images/img_0012.png]6don’t like that and they react accordingly. “He’s mad” or “She’s bad” comes thereflex action, standard issue cry from the herd when it is faced with someonedetermined to be themselves and not a programmed clone. And do you know whatpeople are really saying when they shout “mad” or “bad”? They are really saying“different”. Such is the scale of the conditioning absorbed by the humancollective mind that people can’t cope with anyone who dares to be different.“If I’m in prison, mate, you have to be too. It’s only fair.” We also succumb tothe myth about the “ordinary man and woman in the street ‘ or the “commonpeople”, the idea that the masses are just “ordinary” and only the few who are“extra-ordinary” achieve anything in life. We are “ordinary”, so we must knowour place, this belief system contends. In truth, there is not an “ordinary”man, woman, child or blade of grass in the whole of creation, but people arepersuaded to believe the myth and so they play out the role of being “ordinary”.It’s an act which they are conditioned to perform, like an actor on a stage.Ordinary is not what we are, it is merely what we choose to believe we are. Butit is very powerful in diminishing our sense of worth; another motivation togive our minds away to those we believe to be our “betters”. It is part of theconditioning that includes the claptrap that we are all bom sinners, whateverthe hell that is supposed to mean.Think about the consequences for your life and the planet that result from thisfrar of being YOU. If we give our minds away to others and allow them to tell uswhat to think and do, and if we concede our uniqueness to the fear of beingdifferent, we give control of this world to a tiny Elite who use their power andmanipulation to dictate the limits of the Hassle-Free Zone. Whoever decides thepoint at which a view or lifestyle is inside or outside the Zone (the point atwhich you meet ridicule or condemnation), also dictates the limits within whichbillions of people live their lives because they are terrified of beingdifferent from the herd. Again and again people say they support what I amsaying and doing, but they dare not say so for fear of the consequences. Wellit’s time to summon the courage, because the consequences of keeping quiet aregoing to be far worse than speaking out and being proud of what you think andwhat you are. What’s happened to us, for goodness sake? We have taken on a massschizophrenia in which we have become both the prisoners of the Hassle-Free Zoneand its police force. Because we don’t respect our own right to be unique, weconfomi to the limits of the Zone andPicture #13 [images/img_0013.png]7become a slave. Because we don’t respect everyone else’s right to be unique, webecome the police force or the farmer hassling and herding the other slaves intoacquiescence. The ridicule and condemnation can only reach the levels requiredto frighten people into submission if the masses, the other slaves, play theirpart in dispensing it. We are not frightened by what the presidents, primeministers and global bankers think about us - it is the reaction of our friends,family, and workmates that concerns us and frightens us into conformity. Thereaction of the other slaves! The mental, emotional, and spiritual police forcewhich controls the masses is itself peopled by., .the masses. It is like havinga cell full of prisoners and whenever one of the prisoners finds a means ofescape, all the other prisoners mn to block the exit.Prejudice is the vital word here. People are conditioned to be prejudicedagainst other members and groups within each culture and society, and thesedifferent forms of prejudice are used to divide and rule the herd. The prejudicemay be racial, religious or political, or based on background, income, job orlifestyle. Either way you have different aspects of society conditioned toinstinctively ridicule, oppdse and condemn the views and life experiences ofeach other. And the prejudice is rarely only one way. Those who see themselvesas victims of prejudice are so often prejudiced themselves against other people,lifestyles and groups. This allows the manipulation of the mass consciousness toflourish and yet if we stopped seeking to impose our version of right and wrong,good and bad, moral and immoral upon each other, we would remove the means forsuch global manipulation. We need to let go of all prejudice - now!We have given up our own unique identities to such an extent that we judgeourselves and others by the Tobs” that we do and the dogmas we cling to. How weand they serve the system that controls us has become our sense of identity, thesymbol of who we are! What are you? Oh, I’m a Christian, a Muslim, a Socialist,a Republican, a Pagan. We have to be something instead of being someone -ourselves. We also ask people we meet what they “do” for a living because wethink this will give us a fix on “who” they are. “Oh you’re a stockbroker andyou’re a miner, and you’re a road sweeper. Right, got that - success, rough anddirty, complete failure. OK, I know you all now. Drink anyone?” We judge peopleand ourselves, not by what we are, but by what we own or by what we “do”. Thisjudgment corresponds with the system’s view of reality because we have concededthe right to express our own uniqueness. Someone who makes millions by abusingthePicture #14 [images/img_0014.png]planet and great swathes of humanity every day by decisions they make in theglobal stockmarkets (casinos) is deemed to have “made it” to be successful.While others who do no-one any harm, and indeed may strive to help people andgive love to the world, are considered a failure if they happen to work in alow-paid job or be “unemployed”. A friend at school was always being laughed atbecause his father emptied dustbins for a living. But those who laughedworshipped famous footballers. This is an example of our topsyturvy view of“success”. Who would we miss most if they did not work for a month, thefootballer or the garbage collector? The latter, of course, because the streetsand our homes would be full of rubbish and, eventually, disease. This attitude o(judging each other by our “jobs” is to ignore and deny who we really are.We are not “stockbrokers”, “miners”, or “road sweepers”. These are merely roleswe play on the stage of life. A stockbroker today could be a pauper tomorrow.Our “role” is not “us”, just as the character that an actor plays is not theactor’s real persona. Our jobs and “roles” are a temporary vehicle forexperience, that’s all. We are evolving consciousness on an eternal journeytowards greater love, knowledge and understanding, but we have forgotten thisand we have been encouraged to forget it. We are like actors who think the movieis real and we have taken on the personalities described in someone else’sscript. We think the role is “us”. It isn’t. But we have the actor playing thestockbroker looking down his nose at the actor who is playing the road sweeperwhen, in another life, another movie, those roles may be reversed. It’s only agame, but we think it’s real. That’s why it has degenerated into such a mess. Weare taking the game too seriously. It’s just a movie and it is supposed to befun.One enormous diversion that we have allowed to confuse us so effectively is theconcept of democracy. We have accepted en masse that democracy is another wordfor freedom. Like hell it is. Democracy is not freedom, it is a dictatorshipcamouflaged as freedom. The same force controls, directly or indirectly, everymajor political party and movement. It created most of them. When you vote at anelection, you are choosing between different aspects of the same force. Themoney and the media decide who becomes president of the United States and themoney and the media are owned and controlled by the same people. Let us writethe following in letters 20 feet high: Democracy Is Not Freedom. 30 peopletelling 49 what to do is not freedom. In fact, most governments are elected by aminority of the population and they stillPicture #15 [images/img_0015.png]9call it a “democratic” election. Freedom is the right of all people to expresswho they are, what they think, and how they wish to live their lives: free fromimposition or hassle from anyone. It is to be able to celebrate our individualuniqueness without rales, regulations, ridicule and condemnation from those whoseek to impose their view of life upon the rest of us.Until we respect our own, and everyone’s, right to be different, to make our ownchoices, and create our own conscious realities free from imposition andpressure to conform, we will remain in a prison of our own making. We willcontinue to be both the policeman and the prisoner. And a handful of people witha deeply unpleasant agenda will continue to ran the world. The choice, asalways, is ours. We can accept the prison or we can walk out to freedom. Andfreedom is but a thought away.Picture #16 [images/img_0016.png]10Chapter 2Defending The DogmaAlongside the illusion that we are free, is the illusion that we are different.Sound like a contradiction? Here I am saying we are unique and at the same timethat we have a misguided belief that we are different. There is nocontradiction.We are unique within our multidimensional consciousness, but within the limitedvision of the Hassle-Free Zone there are endless “differences” we call dogmaswhich are, in truth, not different at all. The devotees of Christian dogma thinkthey are different from those who are slaves ofjewish dogma. The fundamentalistrabbi believes he is different from the fundamentalist ayatollah. But they arenot. They are the same thought pattern with a slightly different dress on. Theyare all prisoners of a dogma who wish to convert other prisoners to accept thesame dogma. They all use fear, guilt and other forms of imposition to manipulateand frighten people into line. Their line. What is the difference between thenuns at a Roman Catholic convent using fear and guilt to control the thinking ofchildren and young people, and a rabbi or muslim cleric using the fear of helland damnation and enormous family pressures to do the same? Answer: nothing.They are different aspects of the same state of mind, but they think they aredifferent to the point where their dogmas come into physical conflict. They areall arrogant enough to claim they know the “will of God” and they claim to havebeen chosen to tell everyone what God insists they believe. Poor old God musthave a production line turning out His different “wills”. Either that, or He(it’s always a “He”) has great difficulty making up His mind. God used to beindecisive, but now He’s not so sure. Are we really being asked to accept thatsome God is sitting on a cloud selecting his chosen people and then orderingthem to control and manipulate everyone else? Indeed we are. We can now go over“live” to heaven where God is about to announce the panel’s verdict:Picture #17 [images/img_0017.png]11“OK, after much discussion and consideration of the various business plans, myangels and I have awarded the God Franchise (Earth Branch) to the RomanCatholics. My will is that the Pope should tell all people how to live theirlives and that he and the Vatican should be controlled by the upper levels ofthe secret society network like the Freemasons and the Knights ofMalta. If anyPope does not agree to this control, he should be murdered (as with Pope JohnPaul I in 1978). I also will that the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church shouldterrify little children to prepare them for a life of being told what to do andto ensure that they believe what the church wants them to believe. 1 will thatan inquisition should be formed by said Pope to burn everyone he and hishenchmen decide do riot believe in every single word of my bible, the King Jamesversion of which has been documented to have 36,191 errors in translation alone.I will that my son, the Prince of Peace (also biown quite wrongly as “Jesus ”)1,should be nailed to a cross and suffer unbelievable pain so that the rest ofhumanity shall be able to kill and plunder each other while having their sinsforgiven forever!Oh, my God! Sony, oh my Me! That doesn ’t sound right. It’s not veiy Godly and Iam God after all. Er, no, er I’ve changed my mind:My will now is that Jews are my chosen people, even though, contrary toworldwide indoctrination, there is no such thing as a Jewish “race ”, just asthere is no “Aiyan ” race, either. I will that the Jewish hierarchy shouldterrfiy their children to prepare them for a life of being told what to do andto ensure they conform to whatever the hierarchy tells them. This fear should beconstantly applied throughout their lives. They should be made to fear terroristattacks (for which their own hierarchy are often responsible) and made tobelieve that only by giving their minds and power away to the hierarchy willthey be protectedfrom their enemies. As I gave a strip of land to my chosenpeople thousands of years ago (or so the history books tell me, I don’t remembermyself), 1 will that the Palestinian Arabs should be terrorised out of theirhomes, that their land be called Israel, and that some of the terroristsinvolved such as Ben-Gurion, Begin, Rabin, and Shamir, should later become primeministers and display record-breaking hypocrisy by denouncing the terrorism ofothers. I thought about insisting that Jewish people be'Jesus is a Greek translation of a Jewish name, probably Y’shua ben Yosef(Joshua, son of Joseph).Picture #18 [images/img_0018.png]12told that they can speak to me by putting little bits of paper into the cracksbetween the stones in the Wailing Wall, but no-one would ever believe that. Tosum up, I will that the Jewish hierarchy are my chosen people and, as theirbook, the Talmud, says: ‘Just the Jews are humans, the non-Jews are no humans,but cattleOh my Me! That doesn ’t sound right, either. It’s not very Godly and I am Godafter all. Er, no, er, I’ve changed my mind again:This time I will that my real voice on Earth is the Muslim hierarchy and thatthey should terr([y their children to prepare them for a Ifte of being told whatto do and to ensure they conform to my rules. I told all this to a guy calledMohammed a long time ago and he was very good because he and his successors leda vast army of followers to kill and maim anyone who didn’t accept them as myrepresentatives on Earth. I will that the religion called Islam created in myname should be used to keep the people in fear, guilt, and order while myhierarchy use the oil money for their own benefit and keep the rest of thepeople in servitude and poverty in the name of my religion. I will that womenshould not be able to show more than their eyes in public because, although Icreated the physical body, I am terribly ashamed of it. Ifurther will that menshould always be in control and that women (one of my aberrations, oops!) shouldbe forced to do as they are told.Oh my Me! That doesn’t sound right, either. I'm terribly confused. 1 can’tdecide. Let the people choose. Go on, fight for it. Blow the living daylightsout of each other. Rape the planet., .yeeesssss.. .go for it. Last one alivewins and sits at my right hand next to the Prince of Peace. Deal? ”A bit disturbing that isn’t it? Some confused God looking down, searching forHis chosen ones by pulling straws and saying eeni-meenimini-mo? And tellingeveryone He’s on their side, so they slaughter each other in His name. Mind you,amid His confusion there is one common theme in “God’s” deliberations:frightening people to make them conform. It couldn’t just be, could it, thatthese variations on the same thought pattern have absolutely nothing to do with“God” and spirituality and everything to do with the desire of some humans todictate the lives of all the rest? Oh yes it could. ’Twas always so throughoutrecorded history and ‘twill always be so until we take ourPicture #19 [images/img_0019.png]13power back by making our own decisions and moulding our own, individual, senseof reality. No-one is “bom” a Christian, a Jew or a Muslim. People areconditioned to be Christians, Jews and Muslims after they are bom. When we takeon someone else’s beliefs, lock, stock and barrel, and especially when we needto be frightened into accepting them, we walk a very dark and dangerous road:for ourselves and for the world.But so few have learned this lesson of the centuries. We still believe too muchand think too little. We “feel” intuitively even less. The rigidity andmanipulation of “beliefs” (dogma and prejudice) is how we are controlled. Today,with the dawn of the 21st century almost upon us, we still have men in dogcollars and frocks sitting around a table decoding what we should or should notbelieve. Billions of people continue to be controlled and limited by theirdevotion to the false gods called Popes, priests, archbishops, rabbis,ayatollahs and their like across the spectrum of religious beliefs which havebeen peddled and poisoned over the centuries by those in pursuit of control.Even worse, the desire is to pressure others to believe the same and wheneveranyone asks an unanswerable question of religion (not difficult) out is wheeledthe trusty break-the-glass-and-use-in-allemergencies reply of “have faith”. Iremember being told on a Northern Ireland radio programme after I listed a fewreligious contradictions that these were things that God did not want us toknow! Have we learned nothing with the passage of time? And for those who haveevolved beyond the child-like state of off-the-peg religion, there are otherdogmas waiting to ensnare them. Political, scientific, environmental and “NewAge” dogma among them. As with religion, these “opposites” are merely aspects ofthe same state of mind. I am told that Communism (the far Left) is differentfrom Nazism (the far Right). The idea is ludicrous. The far Left, as symbolisedby Josef Stalin, believes in centralised control, military dictatorship, andconcentration camps. The far Right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler, believes incentralised control, military dictatorship, and concentration camps. Spot thedifference? Of course not. When you peel away the smoke-screen rhetoric, theyare the same. Yet these two “opposites” went to war with each other and acrossthe world the Communists go on “anti-Nazi” marches and Nazis protest against theCommunists. Conflict through the ages has not been between opposites, butversions of the same state of mind: the desire to control others. Communism andNazism did not fight for freedom in thePicture #20 [images/img_0020.png]14Second World War; it was a battle to decide which aspect of the same thoughtpattern would control the vast lands of Eastern Europe.I see “Socialists” claiming to be different from “Capitalists”. Not at theircore they are not. Socialism believes in taking more and more from the Earth andusing these “resources” to produce more and more “things” at the expense of theplanet. Capitalism believes in taking more and more from the Earth and usingthese “resources” to produce more and more “things” at the expense of theplanet. Socialism believes that this production should be controlled by the fewat the centre who dictate the economic pQlicy. Capitalism believes in thesurvival of the strongest which leads to control by the few at the centre, whodictate economic policy. On the fundamentals, they are two sides of the samethought wave and yet socialism and capitalism (cartelism) are portrayed asopposite dogmas offering an alternative view. On the Right, they wish to stopthe free flow of information which challenges their dogma. On the Left, theRobot Radicals, as I call them, wish to stop the free flow of information whichchallenges their dogma. The Right seek to assassinate the character of those whodisagree with them and to deny a public platform for their views. The Left, theRobot Radicals, seek to assassinate the character of those who disagree withthem and to deny a public platform for their views. Again, spot the difference?My own experience of “Nazi” behaviour has almost always come from those claimingto be “anti-Nazis”. The anti-fascist fascists are a wonder to behold. The mentalgymnastics and self delusion required for such a state of mind defies theimagination.Throughout the Hassle-Free Zones of religious, political, “scientific” andeconomic dogma you find these “oppo-sames” fighting and condemning each other.In the United States, the main opposition to the Global Conspiracy, which Iexpose in ... and the truth shall set you free and The Robots ’ Rebellion, isthe Christian Patriot Movement. You will find the same mindset within theIslamic Patriot Movement, the Jewish Patriot Movement, ad infinitum. I welcomethe efforts of the Christian Patriots to make public the plans to create acentralised global tyranny and a microchipped, robotic, population. But what istheir alternative? The return to an imposed Christian dogma and national flagwaving. Some call for the people behind the conspiracy to be hanged and forpeople to defend themselves with guns and violence. You don’t stop a tyrannywith another tyranny. You don’t stop violence with violence. And you don’teliminate hatred with more hatred. You just double the hatred. Nor do you removedivisions by waving your flag, putting the wants ofPicture #21 [images/img_0021.png]15your country above the needs of others on the planet, and claiming that yournation and people are the best in the world.You stop a tyranny with freedom for all; you end violence by being peaceful; youeliminate hatred with love; you end dogma with freedom of expression; and youremove divisions by realising that all of us are One - all aspects of the sameinfinite consciousness we call God.Within the Hassle-Free Zone there are so few differences between people in theirbasic attitudes and responses. They are aspects of the same herd. It is outsidethe Zone that we discover our true uniqueness. On the inside the “differences”have to be manufactured to present us with an illusion of choice and variety,otherwise we would soon realise that, yes indeed, humanity is a blob ofprogrammed, uniform thought. For this reason “sames” are portrayed as“opposites”. It’s all a con. Opposites don’t fight each other. Oppo-sames fighteach other. The opposite of the desire to fight and impose is the desire to loveand set free. These opposites cannot fight because one will always refuse to doso. It is not part of its belief system to fight. So when you see physical andverbal conflict it is always between aspects of the same state of mind -oppo-sames - and never between opposites. Here lies the whole basis of divideand mle: create divisions with manufactured, non-existent “differences” and thenplay them off against each other.Let us recap. Humanity is in prison because:a It gives its mind away and concedes its responsibility and power to think foritself.b It is consumed by fear, especially the fear of what other people think - thefear of being different and unique, c It seeks to impose its dogmas on everyoneand denies the right of each of us to be different and have our own, unique,view.In the light of this, the means of escape from the global Alcatraz isbreathtakingly obvious:a We think for ourselves and refuse to allow others to tell us what to do, beand say.b We let go of fear because fear is our creation. We don’t have to fear, wechoose to. We don’t have to hide our uniqueness, we choose to. We can makeanother choice just as easily.Picture #22 [images/img_0022.png]16c We respect our own right to believe what we choose and, crucially, we respecteveryone’s right to do the same, free from pressure, ridicule, condemnation andimposition of any kind.In those few short sentences you have the means to transform this world from aprison to a paradise. Not one gun needs to be fired, not one trench needs to bedug, nor one new political “ism” created. All it takes is for you to respectyour right to be different and to respect everyone’s right to that same freedom.Yes. It really is that simple.Picture #23 [images/img_0023.png]17Chapter 3The Global DictatorshipControl of the world over a very long period has been achieved by the means Ihave already outlined: mind manipulation, manufactured division, and mostimportant of all, fear. This is the emotion that has handed control of our livesto the manipulating clique which I call the Global Elite.Once you can make people fearful they will look to someone to protect them fromwhatever they have been conditioned to fear. This is why history, and the worldtoday, is full of hyped up “monsters” and “dangerous people” - a focus of fearfrom which we must look to our “leaders” to save us. The fact that these“monsters” and our “leaders” are both appointed and controlled by the same forceis kept from us. We are programmed to see two “sides”, largely projected as“good and evil”, when there are not two sides, but one. In ... and the truthshall set you free, I highlight hundreds of people, events and organisations,who in the public arena appear to be in opposition, but in truth are connectedto the same Global Elite. Among these connections, for example, are thosebetween George Bush and Saddam Hussein, the “opponents” in the Gulf War of 1991.The manufactured Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union was anotherclassic of this kind. Both populations were so filled with fear of each otherthat they gave still more power to their “leaders” and accepted grotesqueweapons expenditure in the misguided belief that they must be protected from the“enemy”. The make-believe, propaganda-created, enemy, as it turns out. Bothsides, including Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev; and other Sovietand American leaders were controlled by the same people. They were the sameside.The Global Elite, the few who decide the direction of the world and humanity,sit atop a pyramid of manipulation (Figure 1 overleaf). Almost everyorganisation today is structured as a pyramid. At the peak you have the tinyelite who know everything about the organisation. ~Picture #24 [images/img_0024.png]The Pyramid of ManipulationGIoImI f lltrPicture #25 [images/img_0025.png]Levels of knowledge .uid heirachy wiitiln •he Institutions. eg - ftom bankcashier •o chairman of (lie boardAll the major institutions and groups that affect our daily lives connect withthe Global Elite, which decides the coordinated policy throughout the pyramid.People in the lower compartments will have no idea what they are part of.Figure 1know its real agenda and what it really wants to achieve. As you come down fromthe peak, you are meeting more and more people who know less and less about thatagenda. This is called compartmentalisation. Those at the top ensure thateveryone lower down in the pyramid know only their own individual contributionto the organisation, company, secret society, whatever. As a result most of themthink their work is quite innocent because they are not allowed to know howtheir work fits in with the others in the pyramid to create a pattern that isanything but innocent. Only the elite at the top know how these individualcontributions fit together and in this way you have people throughout thepyramid working in ignorance of what they are really a part of. The Freemasonsand other secret societies are an obvious example of this method with theirlevels of initiation. Each level has no • idea of the knowledge held in thelevels above them. The vast majority of freemasons never progress higher thanthe third degree, but there are another 30 official levels above that in the socalled Scottish Rite and then another 13 unofficial levels, known as Illuminatilevels, which are not even acknowledged to exist. The majority of freemasons,downPicture #26 [images/img_0026.png]19there on the bottom three levels, are oblivious to what that organisation isreally there to do. They are a manipulated, largely unknowing smoke-screen forthe few who control the secret society. When the freemasonic network is named asa tool of the conspiracy, people think you are saying that every freemason isseeking to take over the world. That’s simply not true. It’s just ridiculous.Secret societies, like almost everything, consist of the leaders (the few) andthe led (the rest).So it is with the global pyramid within which you find all the organisationsthat control our lives - the banking system, political system, multinationalcorporation network, the media, “education”, intelligence agencies, military andso on. The peaks of their individual pyramids all fuse together into the peak ofthe global pyramid, controlled by the ridiculously few people I have called theGlobal Elite. From that peak, the same policy, methods and aims filter downthrough all these, apparently unconnected, aspects of society. At this Elitelevel all the banks, political parties, newspapers and broadcast media,intelligence agencies, multinational companies, and secret societies, are ownedor controlled by the SAME people. This is so important to grasp. The myth ofchoice is there to fool us into believing we are free. Look at how manycompanies the multinational corporations own. These “companies” each have adifferent trade name and appear at first glance to be independent of their“competitors”, but they are owned by the same people. Two of the biggestelectronics retailers in the UK, Dixons and Currys, are owned by the same groupand yet on the high street they appear to be in competition. It is the same withthe UK’s two leading roadside restaurants, Little Chef and Happy Eater. Theexamples of this all over the world are endless. The global food chain isoverwhelmingly controlled by three multinational corporations operating throughscores of different trade names string-pulled from the centre. Choice? What ajoke. Something like 99% of those working within these organisations have nocomprehension of how they are being used. The people who sit behind the counterin a bank won’t be aware of what is going on in their own manager’s office, letalone what is discussed at board level or above that by the Global Elite.They’re just pawns in someone else’s game. They keep their heads down, closetheir minds, and do as they are told just like the human race as a whole. Thissubmission to another’s view and the suppression of our own individuality allowsthe Global Elite to set the limits of the Hassle-Free Zones by filtering downthe same policy and attitudes throughout the pyramid. They do this through anetwork of organisations which include the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairsPicture #27 [images/img_0027.png]20in London, the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, the TrilateralCommission (US-Europe-Japan), and the most influential of them, the BilderbergGroup. There are many other offshoots of this network, like the Pinay Circle or“Le Cerde” which works to remove political leaders deemed unacceptable to theElite. These private organisations have in their membership the top people inpolitics, business, banking, the military, the media, education, etc., who thenpervade the pyramid with a single overall plan which has led to greatercentralisation of power every year. All these institutions which control thedirection of our lives are themselves controlled at the peak of the pyramid bythe same people. You can read about this network in great detail in ... and thetruth shall set you free.I was invited in 1995 to the memorial service for a great British comedian,Larry Grayson, and there a story was told which encapsulated our plight and themeans of escape. During this celebration of Larry’s life, one of his experienceswas told to the assembled throng by another comedian, Roy Hudd. It was a storyfrom the days when Larry used to travel the variety halls of the UK and on thisoccasion he was part of an all-male show which had one “woman” taking part - adressed up Larry Grayson. The producer was very patriotic, Larry had oncerecalled, and the show’s big finish was a rendition of the song. Rule Britannia.The rest of the cast came on wearing sailors uniforms and they climbed on eachothers shoulders to form a human pyramid on the stage. At this point, on walkedLarry dressed as Britannia with the long gown, the helmet, shield and sword, andhe was manhandled up the pyramid to the top for the finale of the show. Onenight, he said, things seemed to be going rather well. But then he noticed thatthe sailor in the bottom left hand comer of the pyramid had got rather a cough.“And as any ancient Egyptian will tell you” Larry had observed “That is a veryimportant part of the pyramid!”Anyway, this sailor’s cough became progressively worse until he had to step outof the pyramid. And what happened? The whole structure collapsed with sailorsgoing in all directions. Larry Grayson’s shield went one way, his sword another,and he finished up in someone’s lap in the second row. What had caused thepyramid to disintegrate? Not Larry Grayson at the top (symbolic of the GlobalElite), but one sailor at the bottom (symbolic of the “ordinary” man and womanin the street). The real power in a pyramid is at the bottom, not the top, butthe human race has been conditioned to believe the opposite. This is why it hasPicture #28 [images/img_0028.png]21been so important to divide and rale “the masses” into dogmas and factions - theElite know that is where the real power lies and they seek to diffuse that powerby turning “the masses” against each other. Humanity gives its power away tothose who are only up there because humanity holds them up there! The power usedby the Elite to control humanity is merely the power which humanity hands overto them every day. Let’s hear that one more time:The Global Elite are only up there because the rest of humanity holds them upthere. The power used by the Elite to control humanity is merely the power whichhumanity hands over to them every day.Hey, wake me up. This has got to be some crazy nightmare I’m involved in here.It’s not?But we wouldn’t be that stupid would we?We would?We would?I’m sorry, would you excuse me for a moment?Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!Thank you.Every Hassle-Free Zone is a pyramid with religious, political and economicdictators sitting at the peak imposing their will on the rest. They can onlyachieve that if those lower down the pyramid agree to do, unquestioningly,whatever the peak tells them, and believe, unquestioningly, whatever propagandathe peak sends down to condition their thinking and perceptions of life,themselves, and others. It is actually possible in the world our minds havecreated to go through an entire lifetime without having a single originalthought. There the prisoners stand in their Larry Grayson pyramid, their fellowprisonersPicture #29 [images/img_0029.png]22on their shoulders, each telling the other not to move or the whole thing willfall apart. There they stand with aching shoulders and silent minds, terrifiedof walking away from this pyramidic prison. They fear to let go of their(perceived) “security” or to face the ridicule or hostility of those stillmesmerised by the lights of the oncoming car. Security? I beg one’s pardon.Living in jail is security? Having your life controlled and your future dictatedis security? What delusions we weave. Anything based on fear and the suppressionof human potential is never secure. Anything that must be enforced is neversecure. Only freedom for all and by all is secure and can survive.The extent to which billions of people have given their minds away makes thecontrol of the world so simple. We might become robots? We are bloody robots!It’s no good denying that, because if we do we will do nothing about it. Thechildlike way in which we think what we are told to think never ceases to takemy breath away. For 48 hours after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995, it was anightmare to be an Arab in the United States. Why? Because the government(elements of which planted the bomb as we shall eventually realise) announcedthat there might be a Middle East connection. Arabs in America, and even thosewho only looked like Arabs, were harangued in the street in the wake of thisannouncement. Two days or so later the same government said there was not aMiddle East connection1 and suddenly it was OK to be an Arab again. Those whoresponded like this were “adults” acting like babes in arms, puppets on thestrings of official pronouncements, and fodder for the Global Elite.There is no limit to the examples every day of people playing the robot. When Istarted to reveal the background to the global conspiracy and name the names andorganisations involved, the campaign to discredit me began. I was dubbed“anti-Jewish” and a “neo-Nazi”. Now that was no surprise because everyone whogets close to the truth of who really controls the world is attacked in the sameway. The Global Elite has two main defence responses - assassinating those whoare lifting the veil or assassinating their character by branding themantiJewish and Nazi. What followed in the campaign to discredit me was the finalconfirmation that large tracts of the human race no longer have access to theirown minds. The people behind these attacks on me were'In fact I believe there was a Middic East conncetion to that bombing - theIsraeli intelligence agency, Mossad, via an organisation called theAnti-Defamation League, hut that’s another story. See ... and the truth shallset you free.Picture #30 [images/img_0030.png]23two “journalists” in London called Matthew Kalman and John Murray. There werepeople encouraging them too, I am sure, but they have been the public face ofthe campaign. They wrote an astonishing article full of untruths in their ownlittle known magazine and then, by their own admission, they began to hawk this“story” around the mainstream media. Some newspapers refused to print it, butothers like The Guardian and The New Statesman ran this nonsense. More thenfollowed. Over a period of a year, virtually every magazine article making theseaccusations was written by Matthew Kalman and John Murray and almost everynewspaper article was based on “information” supplied by Matthew Kalman and JohnMurray. A magazine called New Moon ran a stunning misrepresentation of my book,... and the truth shall set you free. I was called a Nazi and the front pageconsisted of a picture of me changed to resemble Adolf Hitler. The article waswritten by Matthew Kalman and John Murray and the magazine was edited by...Matthew Kalman. The New Age magazine. Kindred Spirit, also ran a long lettercalling me a Nazi and anti-Jewish. The letter writer was... Matthew Kalman.So the claims of me being an anti-Jewish Nazi were, overwhelmingly, put into thepublic arena by two people. Two people. But given the current state of humanconsciousness, that’s all it takes to mind-control millions. Amazing, but true.In fact you don’t even need two people, one is enough. Suddenly people who hadbelieved I was “mad” because of what the media had told them about my spiritualviews were now convinced that I was “bad” because they were reading innewspapers and magazines (the work of two people) that I was a Nazi. Those whoby their own admission had not read my books or heard me speak, began to protestat my public meetings on the strength of what they had read in the media (twopeople) or what their friends had told them after also reading it in the media(two people). The events at Brighton on the South Coast of England summed up thepoint I am making. The local Robot Radicals believed the untruths fed to them byKalman and Murray and they put so much pressure on Brighton University that theauthorities gave in to threats from a mob and cancelled my meeting at very shortnotice.Had the people at the university who made that decision read my books or heardme speak?Er, no.Picture #31 [images/img_0031.png]24Then where did they get their information about what I was supposed to besaying?The Anti-Nazi League.And where did they get their information from?Kalman and Murray.I booked a hotel in Brighton for the rescheduled talk. It was called TheBrighton Oak. They accepted the booking and things seemed to be going OK. Thenthey suddenly cancelled the booking because of my “far-Righf ’ views. Oh yes?Had the people at the hotel who made that decision read my books or heard mespeak?Er, no.Then where did they get their information from about what I was supposed to besaying?The Anti-Nazi League.And where did they get their information from?Kalman and Murray.We tried at Crawley, just north of Brighton at a theatre owned by CrawleyBorough Council. Forty-eight hours before the event we heard via the media, notthe Council, that the meeting was cancelled. This time the Council did know whatI was going to say because they had seen a video. After viewing that recordingthey wrote to confirm the meeting could go ahead. So why the cancellation? Theyhad been threatened by a phone call from the Robot Radicals in Brighton whichsaid that “the safety of the audience could not be guaranteed”. This from agroup of people who call themselves “anti-fascists”! Instead of standing up forfreedom of speech and against such intimidation, the Council immediatelysuccombed to the threat and stopped me speaking. One phone call and one threatwas all it took because people are soPicture #32 [images/img_0032.png]25easy to manipulate and to frighten. Once again we see the combination of the baabaa and the fear.In this way, we have the quite ludicrous situation in which ... and the truthshall set you free, a book funded by a Jewish man and edited by a woman borninto a Jewish family, is dubbed anti4ewish. And those Robot Radicals and othersbelieve this without one moment’s research or a single second’s thought. In theUnited States, the Kalman and Murray articles were used in an effort todiscredit me by the now infamous Anti Defamation League (ADL), the US front forthe Global Elite and the intelligence agency, Mossad. I highlight the backgroundto the ADL in .. and the truth shall set you free - including its involvement inthe assassination ofJohn F Kennedy. Articles seeking to discredit me, andtherefore my information, were also carefully placed in the “alternative” mediato target people who are naturally suspicious of authority. Unfortunately suchpeople have been conditioned to believe the alternative media as unquestioninglyas others believe the mainstream media. Do they really think the Elite would notseek to infiltrate these “alternatives” also for their own ends? The Brightonstory is a wonderful example of how the few can programme the many, but millionsof other examples are happening around the world every time the clock ticks.A tiny elite can’t control the world by conditioning the human mind? It’schild’s play.The human race is not evil. It has merely allowed itself to become amanipulator’s dream. It has given up thinking to such a degree that the GlobalElite can condition what passes for human brain-cell activity and thereforecontrol the direction of the world. This is the coup d’etat on the mind which Ihave written about in other books. It is not so much that the Global Elite wantto tell us what to think, it is more a case of conditioning people not to think.There are many methods, developed and honed by Elite-controlled organisationsaround the world, which are designed to do this. The key technique is somethingI call problem-reaction-solution (P-R-S). You create a problem, be it a war arun on a currency, a health “scare”, a government collapse, whatever suits yourplans at the time. You make sure, however, that someone else is blamed for this“problem” and not you. This is essential. You then use the global media, whichyou also own and control, to pressure public opinion into demanding action - the“something must be done” syndrome. In response to this manipulated “problem” andthe stimulated public “reaction”, you then openly offerPicture #33 [images/img_0033.png]26the “solution” to the problem you have created. This “solution” is what youplanned to do all along, but problem-reaction-solution means that not only doyou avoid serious opposition to your plans, you actually manipulate the peopleinto demanding that you do what you intended to do anyway!Some examples:The goal of the Elite is a world government to which nation states, evencontinents, would be subordinate. They call this the New World Order. Theconstant process of centralising economic and political power over hundreds ofyears has not just happened at random: it has been by manipulated design. Thecentralisation on a global level with a world government is only the naturaloutcome of this policy. Whoever controlled the world government (Global Elite)would control the world central bank and world currency, which are also part ofthe agenda known as the New World Order. In short, whoever controlled the worldgovernment would control the planet even more comprehensively than they do now.But world governments don’t just happen. They have to be manipulated intoexistence and at the heart of that strategy must be a plot to discredit thestatus quo, the community and the nation state. If that is working well andharmony reigns, people are not going to accept a world government telling themwhat to do. You have to create the perceived “need” and this is whereproblem-reaction-solution is so effective. As I and many others have documentedin their books, it is provable that the same global bankers and their networksfunded all sides in the First and Second World Wars, and indeed funded theRussian Revolution which brought us the tyranny known as “communism”. I know itsounds staggering at first, but those who financed Britain, Amerjca, and theAllies in those wars also funded the Germans and Adolf Hitler. Why on Earthwould they do that? To follow their long term agenda of total global control.The main aim of a manipulated war is to change the nature of post war society.The world became more centralised as a result of the First World War and evenmore so after the second global conflict. That was the idea (Figure 2). Thehorror and destruction of the First World War led to an understandable cry of“something must be done” and the Elite proposed their “solution”, the League ofNations, their first attempt at a global organisation which could be evolvedstep by step into the world government. They didn’t manage to do that on thisoccasion and thePicture #34 [images/img_0034.png]27Problem-Reaction-Solutlon(Second World War)funding&. political aobA) uhe I Funding &. political manipulation / I ft, >Kmanipulation> <\\r-—r—\\/I Conflict Second World WarFigure 2League of Nations eventually collapsed. But after the Second World War came twoother Elite creations (provable),the United Nations and the European Union. Thealleged reason for the UN’s existence was to prevent wars, but now, as alwaysplanned, we see the UN, and NATO, being used as mere vehicles for the creation,again step by step, of the world army under central control. A world army,which, far from stopping wars, actually fights them! The same principle appliesto the creation of communism and the Soviet Union which was achieved via fundingand political manipulation from the United States and the United Kingdom. Thecreation of two “sides” is an essential part of manipulating peoples’ fear. Tothe “West” the Soviet Union was portrayed as a dangerous monster, the “evilempire”, while in the Soviet Union, the “West” was portrayed in the same way.Fear, divide and rule, the old, old story.The world army scenario is another obvious example of ProblemReaction-Solution.If you want a world army and you want the people to accept it or even demand it,first of all you need a problem. If thePicture #35 [images/img_0035.png]Picture #36 [images/img_0036.png]Picture #37 [images/img_0037.png]Picture #38 [images/img_0038.png]Picture #39 [images/img_0039.png]Picture #40 [images/img_0040.png]28United Nations peacekeeping operation is effective, that is disastrous under therules of Problem-Reaction-Solution. No Problem No Reaction No Solution. Youtherefore manipulate events in places like Bosnia to ensure that the UNpeacekeeping force is not working. The more you can embarrass the UN operationthe better, because as horrific pictures came out of Bosnia day after day thecry of “something must be done” became, again understandably, louder and louder.This provided the opportunity for the solution - a 60,000 strong “NATO” (worldarmy), the biggest multinational force to be assembled since the Second WorldWar. Another mighty step towards the creation of the world army and thedismantling of nation state armies under the guise of “peace” had been achieved.That was the real reason for the Bosnian conflict, hard as I know it must be toaccept if you are new to this research. But if you read ... and the truth shallset you free you will appreciate from the evidence and background that such aconclusion is glaringly obvious. Virtually every major peace negotiator inBosnia, from the start of that conflict, was a member of a network of theBilderberg Group (Bil), the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the TrilateralCommission (TC), and the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA). Theseorganisations are controlled by the same Global Elite that manipulated theconflict into being and then funded and armed all sides in the horror thatensued. The European Union peace negotiators were Lord Carrington (Bil, TC,RIA), Lord David Owen (Bil, TC) and Carl Bildt (Bil). They worked with the UNnegotiators Cyrus Vance (Bil, TC, CFR) and Thorvald Stoltenberg (Bil, TC). Then,amid worldwide publicity, appeared the “independent” peace negotiator, JimmyCarter, the first Trilateral Commission President of the United States and CFRmember. After him came the group who negotiated the world army in Bosnia throughthe so called Dayton Agreement. These were Richard Holbrook (Bil, TC, CFR), whoanswered to the US Secretary of State Warren Christopher (CFR, TC), who in turnreported to President Bill Clinton (Bil, TC, CFR). The world army in the formerYugoslavia was headed from the start by US Admiral Leighton Smith (CFR) and thecivilian aspects of the operation are overseen by Carl Bildt (Bil).Lord Carrington, the former British cabinet minister, who became chairman of theBilderberg Group in 1991, works closely with Henry Kissinger, one of the world’smost prolific manipulators on behalf of the Elite. Interestingly, the horrificwar in Rwanda erupted three days after an undisclosed “diplomatic mission” tothat country led by LordPicture #41 [images/img_0041.png]29Carrington and Henry Kissinger. The former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin(a Kissinger frontman, later assassinated) also agreed arms shipments to Rwandain the ran up to the conflict. People think it must be difficult to start a war,but it isn’t you know. It’s easy, given the desire of so many to give theirminds away. To fight a war you need money and weapons. The Global Elite controlthe supply of both, so that’s never a problem. To start a war you need one“side” to attack another country or community and away we go. The other countryor community will defend itself and the war has begun. Many people are so fullof dogma and racial division and intolerance that finding a group who willattack another is hardly difficult. You are spoilt for choice. The Global Elitenormally ensure that their “employees” or puppets are leading all “sides”, aswith Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and Winston Churchill,in the Second World War. The Global Elite representatives (also known aspresidents and prime minsters) then sell a fairy story to the human herd aboutthe need to “fight for freedom” or “take our Godgiven right to this land” andsuddenly you have two herds knocking seven bells out of each other. Creating awar, even a world war, is not difficult. It’s a doddle. It shouldn’t be, I know,but until humanity wakes up and grows up, it will be so.When you look at the major posts around the world, like the Secretary General ofNATO, the heads of the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the EuropeanUnion Commission, or presidents, prime ministers and top politicians, bankersand industrialists, you find they are members Of or attendees of theorganisations I mention. That includes Bill Clinton, George Bush and virtuallyevery president of the United States since the 1920s. Being invited to join orattend these groups can be a great career move. Bill Clinton was a little knowngovemer for Arkansas until he attended the 1991 Bilderberg meeting in BadanBadan, Germany, at the invitation of his mentors, the Rockefellers. Within oneyear he was successfully campaigning to become president of the most powerfulcountry on Earth. In Britain, there is a similar tale of rapid progressinvolving Tony Blair. He was a Labour Party home affairs spokesman when he wasinvited to the Bilderberg meeting in Vouliagmeni, Greece, in 1993. The followingyear he became leader of the Labour Party and would-be prime minister just ashis opposition, the Conservative Party, began to suffer a stream of scandals andupsets. Blair’s desire to be viewed as a potential world leader was enhancedwhen he was received and supported by Bilderberg frontmen like Clinton andChancellor Kohl of Germany. When Blair visited thePicture #42 [images/img_0042.png]30United States in 1996, his welcoming party read like a Who’s Who of the Elite’sgofers and manipulators. These included Bill Clinton (Bil, CFR, TC), HenryKissinger (Bil, CFR, TC, RIA), Alan Greenspan, the head of the Elite-controlledFederal Reserve banking system (Bil, CFR, TC) and the global financialspeculator George Soros (Bil). So many of Blair’s views and policies, includingthose on the European Union, mirror those of the Elite. I can’t help thinkingthat he has the look of a “chosen one”, whether he knows it or not. These commonconnections between top politicians, peace negotiators, and the people in themajor global posts, are never revealed in the mainstream media. I wonder why?The hundreds of papers and magazines worldwide owned by the Hollinger Group,including Telegraph Newspapers in the UK, don’t mention this covert networkbecause the group is controlled by the Canadian Conrad Black, a core steeringcommittee member of the Bilderberg Group. He hosted their 1996 meeting inToronto and two of his Hollinger/Telegraph directors are Lord Carrington andHenry Kissinger, along with many other New World Order frontmen andmanipulators. Maybe the influence of another Bilderberg steering committeemember, Andrew Knight, on the board of Rupert Murdoch’s News International mightjust be a reason why its newspapers and other media outlets remain silent onthis subject. The Washington Post refuses to inform the public about theseorganisations and their membership because the Post is owned by Katherine Graham(Bil, CFR, TC). On and on it goes. Your mind is being stitched up and so,therefore, is the planet.Another highly effective conditioning technique is what I call thestepping-stones approach. The whole conspiracy is based on mind manipulation andthe Elite are very careful not to go too far too quickly. If they did, even thebewildered herd might see that something is going on. Instead, the Elite settheir goal and move towards it stage by stage. Each of these stages are promotedas independent of each other when, in fact, they are coordinated steps towards along agreed target. The stepping-stones technique changes the world before youreyes in a way which ensures that most people won’t see that anything is changingat all - until it’s too late. I have a three year old son called Jaymie andbecause I have seen quite a lot of him up to now, despite my travels, he doesn’tseem to change much. He’s changed slowly before my eyes every day and it mostlygoes unnoticed. But people who haven’t seen him for a few weeks or months lookat him and say: “My goodness, Jaymie, haven’t you grown, haven’t you changed!”This is the basis ofPicture #43 [images/img_0043.png]31the stepping-stones technique and it is being used to introduce the Elite agendaby stealth.Take the European Union. It was created, as I show in ... and the truth shallset you free, by the same people and organisations who introduced the League ofNations and the United Nations. The European Union, with its plan forcentralised political control, a European Central Bank and a European currency,the Euro, was plotted from the start to be the vehicle through which to imposethe centralised control of Europe, itself merely a stage on the road to theworld government, central bank, currency, army and a microchipped population.That, of course, is not what the people of Europe were told when we were askedto join. The “European Union” was then called the European Economic Community orCommon Market. We were told we were joining a “free trade” area and not acentralised European superstate which would eventually encompass the countriesof the former Soviet Union. Once we were in the web and the economies of Europewere intertwined enough to make withdrawal very difficult in the short term, theprocess began of changing the Common Market “free trade” area into theall-along-planned European tyranny, the European Union. Only now are more peoplebeginning to realise how far this transformation has already progressed. Thesame process is underway with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)which is planned to evolve into the North-Central-South American version of theEuropean Union and this applies to the Asia-Australia “free trade area” known asAPEC.This has all long been planned. It is no coincidence that one of the plans ofAdolf Hitler and the Nazis was the creation of what they called the EuropaischeWirtschaftsgemeinschaft. This translates as.. .The European Economic Community!After 1945, the Nazi mentality merely swapped its jackboots and tin helmets forsmart business suits. Appropriately, the introduction of the European singlecurrency will involve the transfer of the gold, currency and bond reserves ofall member states to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany. This bankwill be controlled by six unelected bankers with a guaranteed eight year periodin office and, as the Maastricht Treaty says, this “super six” cannot have theirdecisions overturned. They become a legal European dictatorship. My goodness,Adolf Hitler would have been delighted to see his plan unfold under the guidanceof another German leader, Chancellor Flelmet Kohl, a longtime and passionatefrontman for the Bilderberg Group.Picture #44 [images/img_0044.png]32The introduction of “voluntary” identity cards in the UK is a classic case ofthe stepping-stones principle. If the government (Global Elite) had made themcompulsory it would have triggered opposition from civil liberties groups andstarted a debate about the erosion of freedom. But by introducing them initiallyas “voluntary” that opposition was spiked. Then you ensure that it isincreasingly difficult to operate without the cards and you offer incentives tocarry them. In the end you achieve your goal but without the hassle of concertedopposition or public debate.The stepping-stones technique is also being used to phase out cash and move usever closer to the day when all money will be electronic and financialtransactions will be processed via computers and tiny microchips under the skinwhich will carry all financial and personal details. We are being conditioned tobelieve that the phasing out of notes and coins will make everything more“efficient” and the manipulators are appealing to human prejudice by emphasisinghow the end of cash will stop social security fraud and tax evasion. The realreason, however, is control. Once cash has gone we hand the power over our livesto a computer and its programmer. If you go into a shop now with a credit card(electronic money) and the computer refuses to accept it, at least you stillhave another means of purchase, you can pay cash. But what happens when there isno cash and the computer says no to your credit card or microchip? How do youpurchase? You can’t. The computer, and whoever programmes its responses,controls what, when, and if you buy More than that, as some electronicsengineers have warned, once we have a microchip inside us, messages can passfrom the computer to the chip which can create mass anger, hysteria, aggression,and a stream of other emotions. We will literally be robots then. And this is noscience fiction sometime-maybe prediction. It is desperately close and trialsinvolving microchipping are already in operation around the world. Thetechnology exists and the only thing left is to manipulate the human mind toaccept it. This conditioning has been underway for some time and themicrochipping of domestic animals is becoming routine. In the Autumn of 1995 Isaw an item on the BBC’s “science” programme. Tomorrow’s World, which lookedvery positively at a scheme to microchip people with their medical records. Awoman was featured with a microchip in her chest and along came the doctor witha bar-code reader like those they use in the supermarkets. As he ran thiscontraption down her front, up on the screen came her medical information. “Oh Ithink it’s a wonderful idea” the lady told the camera “It’s very convenient”.Picture #45 [images/img_0045.png]33I’m sorry, would you just excuse me once more?Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!Thank you.You can see the potential when you look at how satellite television operates.Each subscriber has a card programmed to accept the channels they have paid for.If later you wish to subscribe to another channel, you might think you wouldhave to send away for a new card. No, no. You ring the subscribers’ departmentand they ask you to put the television on the station you want. At this pointall you see is a scrambled fuzz. Then before your eyes, the scrambled channelappears in seconds. How did they do that?, I asked. They send out a signal whichreprogrammes your card and no-one else’s! They have the ability, even onsatellite television, to isolate one card in one television in one home. Andthey can’t do that with a microchip inside one person? Of course they can andthat’s the idea.If you do nothing else to stand up for freedom, I would at least ask you toconsider the consequences for you and your children of allowing the programme ofhuman microchipping to commence unchallenged. You will be hearing a stream of“justifications” for microchipping, including the microchipping of children atbirth (“You’ll never lose your child again”), the storing of financialinformation to make credit cards redundant (“We can end credit card theft andfraud”), and the means to prove identity (“It will help to end crime, remove theneed for passports, and stop illegal immigration and social security fraud”).All these claims and more are designed to manipulate your mind into acceptingthe microchip which will turn you into a fully fledged robot.The microchip and the cashless society are part of that fundamental tool in thecontrol of human existence., .the world financial system. Ask most people whythey are not doing or saying what they really believe is right and the reasonwill be fear. A major expression of that fear is the need to earn money to live.Again, that’s the idea. If you can artificially inflate the cost of the basicsof life, food, warmth, clothing, and shelter, you pressure people to serve yoursystem to earn the money to buy those basics. The less you need to earn, themore choice you have to live your life as you see fit. The more you need toearn, the fewer the choices. This scam is founded on the greatest con trick ofthem all - the paying of interest on money that doesn’t exist. The factPicture #46 [images/img_0046.png]34that we stand for this as a human race, reveals so much about the scale of thecollective mind-cloning that has unfolded on this planet.The Elite-controlled banks are legally lending as a matter of course tenthousand pounds for every thousand pounds they actually own. It is like youowning a hundred pounds, but lending a thousand pounds to your friends andcharging them interest. Should each of your friends demand cash in their hands,you couldn’t work this scam, but the banks have no such problem because most oftheir transactions do not involve cash. They work mostly with theoretical“money” - cheques and credit cards. If everyone went to the bank to ask fortheir money back at the same time, the banks would be bankrupt many times overbecause they are lending far more than they have deposited with them. All but afraction of the money that the banks “loan” doesn’t physically exist. Mostpeople believe that banks lend only the money that customers have deposited withthem. This is simply not true. What the banks lend is, in effect... nothing.When you go to a bank for a loan your account is “credited” with that amount.All the bank has done is to type the amount of your loan, say £10,000, onto acomputer disk. If the bank was lending you its customers money, their accountswould have to be reduced by £10,000 to allow you to have the loan. But they’renot. They remain the same. So where has this mysterious £10,000 suddenlyappeared from? Your “loan”, as with every “loan”, is conjured out of nothing asmerely figures on a computer screen! And from that moment you begin to payinterest on that non-existent money. More than that, this phantom “money” iseven counted in the bank’s accounts as an “asset” and this allows it to make yetmore loans of the same kind. With every loan, the borrower goes into debt andthe bank’s official assets increase, and yet not one new coin has been mintedand ‘not one new note has been printed. It’s all an illusion. Banking is themost profitable and most destructive criminal activity on the planet. People whogrow food and produce the necessities of life are up to their eyes in debt, andoften pushed into bankruptcy and rain by people who do nothing more than typefigures onto a computer screen and charge interest on them. Fantastic amounts of“money” are in circulation in the form of cheques and credit of various kinds,but less than ten per cent of it is in the form of coins and notes. More thanninety per cent of it doesn’t exist. The system is massively bankrupt and itonly survives because people are conditioned into accepting cheques and creditcards as “money” when, in fact, it is nothing more than an entry on a computerprogram with nothing whatsoever to back it up.Picture #47 [images/img_0047.png]35Staggeringly, this is how the vast majority of “money” is put into circulation -not by governments printing cash, but by private banks lending money thatdoesn’t exist and charging interest on it. By credit in other words. This meansthat all but a fraction of the “money” used to exchange for goods and servicesis created, right at the start, as a debt. We hear that inflation is caused bygovernments printing too much money. No it’s not. Governments don’t printenough! Ninety per cent of “money” released into circulation is “created” in theform of debt by the private banking network controlled by the Global Elite. Itis utterly insane and no wonder the mountain of debt increases by the minute. Aneconomic “boom” when production and consumption increases, simply leads to moreborrowing from the banks to increase spending. So in the economic “good times”,the amount of debt increases by colossal amounts and this eventually leads tothe bad times known as depression. As the banks have control over the creationof “money” through loans, they decide if there is to be an economic boom ordepression by increasing or decreasing the amount of “money” they allow peopleto borrow. The difference between a boom and a bust is only the amount of moneyavailable through cash or credit to make purchases. As the banking system iscontrolled by the Global Elite, this tiny clique therefore have control over theeconomy of every country and the decisions of the political and economic“leaders” who either don’t understand how the banking system and money creationreally works (the majority) or are knowingly working with those who run thesystem. By this sleight of hand, the debts of people, businesses, and countrieshave soared into never-never-land and the need to pay the interest is reflectedin the money we pay for taxation, food, warmth, clothing and shelter. TheBritish Government spends far more on interest charges per year than it does oneducation and once you realise how the system works it is no longer surprisingthat the United States is trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.Look at what happens in one transaction alone. Say the US government wants toborrow a billion dollars to cover its short fall in income. It issues a Treasurynote or bill, an IOU in other words, and delivers it to the Federal Reserve, acartel of private banks controlled by the Global Elite. The bankers then“create” a billion dollars at negligible cost to them. At this point the banksbegin to charge the government (the people) interest on a billion dollars. Notonly that, the piece of paper, the IOU, is now counted as an “asset” of thebanks and it appears in their accounts as if they actually own a billion dollarsinPicture #48 [images/img_0048.png]36their coffers. This means that they can lend another ten billion dollars (atleast) of non-existent “credit” to other customers!Everyone involved in a production process, be it the supplier of the materials,the producer, the transportation company, the shop, etc... are all adding extrato their prices to cover their need to pay interest on the non-existent moneythey have “borrowed”. By the time you buy a product in the shop, its price ismassively inflated compared with what it needs to be, because each stage in theprocess is servicing interest payments on money that doesn’t exist. We arebuying three houses for the right to live in one because two thirds, sometimesmore, of the money we pay on a mortgage is interest on money that doesn’t exist.If you take out a £50,000 loan to buy a house with Britain’s NationalWestminster Bank you will pay them back £152,000. You will buy three houses tolive in one. On the leaflet which revealed these figures, they had the nerve tosay: The National Westminster Bank - we re here to make life easier”. Thanks somuch. I’m really grateful. All over the planet are people doing things they haveno desire to do because they need to pay interest on money that doesn’t exist.The Third World Debt which is crucifying billions of people by the day, isoverwhelming debt on money that has never, does not, and will never exist. Andwe stand for this!It is a con trick. It is not necessary. It is there to control us. That is whythe system was created in the first place.Despite the obvious insanity of this legalised theft, our minds are stillconditioned to believe that charging interest on money is essential and withoutit the world economy would collapse. Not so. The global banking dictatorshiporchestrated by the Global Elite would collapse and that would be fantastic. Butpeople who are enslaved by paying interest on money that doesn’t exist, defendthe system and say it must continue! Hey, prison warder, don’t you dare openthat door, d’ya hear? The interest system is not a safeguard against economicsuffering. In truth the interest system creates poverty and inequality andallows the accumulation of global power. Tell me this: what would happen if,instead of borrowing non-existent money from the private banking network, ourgovernments printed their own money interest-free and lent it to the peopleinterest-free with perhaps a very small one-off fee to cover administrationcosts? Would we no longer be able to buy all we need? Yes, of course we would,and far more easily because the cost of everything would be less. The cost of amortgage would plummet by two-thirds if you no longer had to pay interest. ThePicture #49 [images/img_0049.png]37homeless could be housed and we would not have the grotesque sight of peoplesleeping rough in the streets because they cannot gather together enough piecesof paper or non-existent computer figures to pay for a proper shelter. Moneywould become what it was meant to be, a means of exchanging contributions to thecommunity which smooths out the limitations of barter. It is only when you haveinterest on money that it becomes the vehicle for control which is used withsuch devastating effect today. No-one gains from the payment of interest, exceptthe banks of the Global Elite. No-one would lose out if the system were changed,except for the banking nexus and those who use money to make money without anyproductive contribution to the world. The banks which have plundered and abusedhumanity for so long would go under and the role of their successors would beconstructive rather than destructive. Is the demise of interest-charging banksreally so terrible? I’m leaping for joy at the very thought. There is no reasonwhy we cannot have interest-free money. It is only the will that is missingbecause the politicians who could bring an end to interest on money arecontrolled and manipulated by the same people who own the global banking systemwhich wields its power over people’s lives by demanding interest on money thatdoesn’t exist. Look at the “different” political parties in your country. Howmany of them are proposing to end interest on money if they are voted intopower? None? Thank you. And now you know why.Two presidents of the United States have proposed to print interestfree moneyand begun in a small way to introduce it. One was Abraham Lincoln and the otherwas John F Kennedy. What else do they have in common?An important question to ask constantly is “who benefits?” Whenever apolitician, economist, church leader, journalist, or anyone is telling us whatto think it is worth asking that question: who benefits from me believing what Iam being asked to believe? The answer invariably leads you to the real reasonyou are being fed that line of “thinking”. For example, who benefits from peoplebelieving that “far-right militias” were behind the Oklahoma bomb? Those whowish to discredit the militias’ claims about the Global Conspiracy and those whowish to justify the introduction of more authoritarian laws in the United Statesand, as President Clinton put it within 24 hours of the bomb: “an easing ofrestrictions on the military’s involvement in domestic law enforcement”. Whobenefited from the bomb in Saudi Arabia in 1996 which killed 19 Americans?Those, like Bill Clinton,Picture #50 [images/img_0050.png]38who wanted a problem-reaction-solution situation to justify a greater erosion offreedom. The G7 meeting of industrialised countries which followed the bombingwas dominated by the need to “fight” terrorism. They then arranged for a G7summit on terrorism and measures (erosion of freedom) to stop it. What happenedin the days before that summit? A TWA airliner was blown from the sky shortlyafter leaving New York and a bomb exploded in Atlanta during the Olympic Games.Who benefited? Those who wanted to put terrorism at the top of the world agendaat the time of the G7 meeting. Witnesses report seeing a flash of light soaringtowards the TWA jet, seconds before it exploded.I’ve described in this chapter some of the consequences of conceding to othersour right to think for ourselves. When we do that, we:a allow a tiny Elite to decide our destiny, and that of our children; b allowthis Elite to so programme our sense of limitation that we live at a fraction ofour true potential; c allow our minds to be manipulated minute by minute to seeevents and people in precisely the way the Elite desire; d allow a relativehandful of bankers to control the finances of billions of people by charginginterest on money that doesn’t exist.When you give your mind away, you give your life away. When large numbers ofpeople do that, they give the world away. This is precisea’ what we have done.The state of the world and the shape of own lives is not someone else’s “fault”.There is no-one to blame for what happens to us and our fellow expressions ofGod. What I have briefly outlined here is of our doing. The manipulation andcontrol I have described is our creation, a reflection of the current state ofhuman thought or non-thought. We are responsible for what has occurred andcontinues to do so.If anyone is still in any doubt about the scale to which we have conceded ourdestiny to a tiny clique, or of the deeply unbalanced mentality that motivatesthat clique, the next chapter will blow your mind.Picture #51 [images/img_0051.png]39Chapter 4The Depths Of EvilI trust you’ll enjoy a few laughs as this book progresses because humour is soimportant. It is a wonderful antidote to fear and puts all those events andareas of ours lives that make us frightened, control our thinking, and cause usemotional pain into perspective. When subjected to humour, most things that wetake seriously are shown to be what they really are: utterly ludicrous.However, in this chapter there are no laughs. Some things are so grotesque, sobeyond the imagination of anyone within a thousand miles of mental and emotionalbalance, that humour does not and cannot apply. In my years of speaking andwriting about these spiritual and conspiratorial subjects I have resisted usingthe word evil. Even now I emphasise that what we call “evil” is an extremenegative imbalance in the consciousness and people in that mode can and dochange. “Evil” is not forever. It is for as long as those minds choose to stayin that state of being. But in the light, or rather the dark, of what I am aboutto outline, the feel of that word evil seems so appropriate. Indeed we aretalking the very depths of evil.People who desire to dominate the world and control the lives and thinking (samething) of billions are seriously imbalanced. Many of them are psychopaths. It isvital to understand this if we are to appreciate how it is possible to coldlysit down and organise the manipulation of wars, famine, and disease, which bringuntold suffering and misery to Planet Earth. Nor does such a mental statemanifest in only one aspect of their behaviour. It affects their entire being.Nothing confirms this more than the creation of human robots throughmind-control and the almost unimaginable torture to which they are subjected.Information about this began to come my way from a number of unconnected sourceswhile I was writing this book and I feel compelled to share it with you. Thenyou will see the scale of evil to which we, the human race, have concededcontrol over our lives and our children’s lives.Picture #52 [images/img_0052.png]40Knowledge is not positive or negative, it is always neutral. It is how knowledgeis used that is positive or negative. The same knowledge that can create weaponsof mass destruction can also be applied to produce free energy technology whichcan provide all the power and warmth we need at virtually no cost and no damageto the environment. So it is with what we call esoteric knowledge which somemisguided people dismiss and condemn as the “occult”, a word, incidentally,which merely means hidden. They brand this knowledge as the work of the devil.Others seem to believe, naively, that esoteric knowledge is by its naturespiritual and of “the light.” It is neither good or bad, it just is. It is onlythe knowledge of the nature of life and consciousness. It can be used to set theconsciousness free from its self imposed limitations of potential andperception, or it can be used to inspire that very sense of limitation andpowerlessness.This knowledge, the themes of which are revealed in this book, is as old ascreation and even in the desperately short period described by what we callrecorded “history” it can be charted back to thousands of years BC to thecivilisations of ancient Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and every other cultureacross the world. Variations of this basic core knowledge and its doctored andmanipulated versions formed the basis of all the religions. They just changedthe names, that’s all. The themes, claims, and ceremonies of Christianity, forexample, originate in the civilisations that long preceded the Christian dogma.The pre-Christian world abounded with stories of virgin-bom sons of God who diedso our sins could be forgiven. The founder of Christianity, Saint Paul, wasreally called Saul of Tarsus. He was brought up in Asia Minor where theyworshiped a “god” called Dionysus who was said to be virtually everything thatPaul later claimed for “Jesus”. Dionysus was said to be a son of God who died tosave the world. “Saint” Paul replaced the name Dionysus with “Jesus” and gavehim the same attributes and myths. So Christianity was bom and nearly twothousand years later it still controls the minds, directly or indirectly, ofbillions today. It’s a con trick and no-one is more conned than most of thepriests and churchmen who promote it. For more details see The Robots'Rebellion.Christianity was soon taken over by the forces of domination and turned into avehicle of mass control. Anyone who expressed views that challenged itsmanufactured nonsenses were systematically removed, not least through theinquisition which burned as heretics those who were not seen as “hue”Christians. The definition of “true” was to follow without question the doctrineimposed by the Pope. ThePicture #53 [images/img_0053.png]41esoteric knowledge, the basic truths of who we are, where we came from, and whatwe are doing here, has been hoarded by the few, in a twisted form, for at leastthousands of years to keep the masses in ignorance of these things. WhenChristianity was invented and condemned the “occult” so violently, the knowledgewas all but eliminated from the mass consciousness. As Christianity continued toexport its creed through death and destruction to the Americas, Africa,Australia, and so on, the esoteric knowledge was further lost as native cultureswere destroyed and “Christianised”. This was perfect for the manipulating forcebecause they could now have a virtual monopoly on the knowledge and itspotential to control and exploit because the people in general were either keptin ignorance or conditioned to see such knowledge as evil. One consequence ofthis was the mass torture and murder of “witches”.The advanced levels of this knowledge had been passed on through secretinitiation ceremonies to the chosen few in the Mystery Schools of Babylon,Egypt, Greece, etc, and certainly long before that in civilisations unrecordedby official history. As the centuries passed, and Christianity withdrew theknowledge from the public arena, the work of these Mystery Schools evolved intothe massive secret society network we see today which includes the Freemasonsand the Knights of Malta, both of which control the Pope and the Vatican. What awonderful way to direct and influence the behaviour of all those Roman Catholicsworldwide. If a Pope does not play the game, he is removed, as with the murderof Pope John Paul 1st, in 1978 (see ... and the truth shall set you free). Themodem Freemasonic network is only the ancient knowledge in the guise of agentlemen’s club. At the time of the Crusades, a number of “knights”organisations emerged, the most famous of which was the Knights Templar. Theywore the symbol of the red cross on the white background which symbolised bloodand semen and represented their knowledge of the power of sexual energy, thecreative force, be it positive or negative in its use. The Templars claimed tobe a Christian organisation - a mere smokescreen for their secret knowledge andbeliefs which originated in ancient Egypt and before. They were purged by thePope and the King of France, but they continued to operate as an undergroundnetwork until they re-emerged publicly as., .the Freemasons. This is the sameorganisation, the Knights Templar under another name, and a major tool for theGlobal Elite’s manipulation of the world. It is no coincidence that the flag ofEngland is the red cross on the whitePicture #54 [images/img_0054.png]42background, nor that this same flag was flown by Christopher Columbus when he“discovered” the islands of the Americas. He wasn’t looking for India only tofind the West Indies. He knew exactly where he was going because he had the mapsthat had been been passed on through the secret society network, of which he wasa member (see ... and the truth shall set you free). The existence of Americawas known about long before it was officially “discovered”. History has justbeen written to suppress this fact and all the questions that would emerge fromit. Those given the knowledge in the initiation ceremonies are said to be“illuminated” and this gave birth to the name of a leading force within theconspiracy, the Illuminati.So here we are in the modem world with a network of secret societies which, atthe peak of the pyramid, are all the same organisation working with the sameknowledge to the same end - control of the world. Of course, most of theirmembership have no idea that this is the case because they never progress beyondthe lowest levels of initiation and are therefore kept in ignorance of what theyare involved with. As I’ve already emphasised, the people who go to their localFreemasons lodge and roll up their trouser leg are the frontmen, the veil, forwhat is really going on at the top. The initiation ceremonies are pretty blackand bizarre even at the lower levels and they become more and more so the higheryou go. One infamous and sinister secret society within the network is the Skulland Bones Society based at Yale University in the United States. The skull andcrossbones flag was also a Templar flag. At the Skull and Bones Societyheadquarters known, appropriately, as the Tomb, carefully selected students areinitiated and, surprise, surprise, so many of them end up in positions of power.George Bush, the President of the United States for three terms of office(including the two officially credited to Ronald Reagan) is a Skull and Bonesmember. He, like all the rest, would have been initiated by lying naked in acoffin with a ribbon tied to his willy while he masturbated and shouted outdetails of his sexual exploits. 1 don’t have a problem with anyone doinganything so long as they don’t force it on other people. Everyone to their own.But this is not just a group of people choosing to stimulate themselves sexuallyin ways that turn them on. ft goes way, way beyond that.A question 1 am constantly, and understandably, asked is: “Who are these peoplewho control the top of the pyramid?” The answer is that they are the chosen fewwho are initiated into the highest levels of the secret society network throughwhich all the other areas of society,Picture #55 [images/img_0055.png]43Figure 3: The Dollar Billbanking, business, politics, media intelligence agencies, the military, and“education”, are controlled by ensuring that representatives of the network areappointed to the major posts or string-pull the people in those posts. TheBilderberg Group-Royal Institute of International Affairs-TrilateralCommission-Council on Foreign Relations conspiracy is supervised by a secretsociety called The Round Table which is, itself, part of the overall globalnetwork. Each generation of manipulators choose the next generation and handover the “keys to the Kingdom”. At the Elite levels there are also a number offamilies, induding the Rockefellers and the House of Rothschild, from whom manyof the Elite are selected in each generation. At the peak of the pyramid, andindeed at other levels, too, the mentality behind the manipulation is based onSatanism and black magic. I call it the Cult of the All Seeing Eye because itsbest known symbol is of a pyramid and all seeing eye - the very picture you willfind on the US dollar bill (Figure 3). The order to print the symbol of a globalblack magic cult on every dollar bill was made by that Elite frontman and 33rddegree Freemason, Franklin D. Roosevelt, while he was President of the UnitedStates in 1935. This same symbol is also the reverse of the Great Seal of theUnited States. How appropriate given that this cult of the All Seeing Eyecontrols the US and its banking and financial system. The symbol, like the cult,goes back to antiquity. We are just experiencing the modern version of it. Thecommon theme of the conspiracy across the centuries is a massively imbalancedconsciousnessPicture #56 [images/img_0056.png]Picture #57 [images/img_0057.png]44which operates in this world through the minds of people open to suchpossession. You might take a step back in amazement and incredulity when firstreading all this, but unfortunately it is true. This is the Satanic state ofmind which currently calls the shots on Planet Earth and that explains so muchabout what goes on here. The All Seeing Eye. at the peak of the pyramid issymbolic of this highly negative consciousness which is known under manydifferent names and guises throughout the world religions and ancient legends.The Egyptians, for instance, called this force “Set”.The knowledge of how to manipulate human consciousness, collectively andindividually, has been accumulated and passed on like a baton for thousands ofyears at the highest levels of the secret society network and so now thisknowledge is vast. It is used to manipulate us through information managementand advertising via the careful use of key words and phrases, sounds, colours,hypnosis, and symbols, the latter of which fundamentally affect the psyche. Thisis why the symbols used today by this network are exactly the same ones thatwere used and held sacred in the ancient world. The Nazi swastika is an ancientesoteric symbol which, in its original form, is positive. But the Nazis turnedit around to symbolise the negative. Just looking at symbols can have a powerfuleffect on the mind and the Nazis knew that. The whole Nazi movement was based onsinister secret societies and the abuse of esoteric knowledge. They wereSatanists because they, too, were connected to the cult of the All Seeing Eye.So were the hierarchy controlling the Americans, French, British, and Russians,who “opposed” them!As I have shown in other books, the ability to turn someone into a robot by mindprogramming has been understood for a very long time and it is becoming moresophisticated and advanced with every year. Much knowledge was taken to theUnited States after the Second World War by the Nazi mind-controllers andgeneticists who were spirited out of Germany after 1945 by a British-Americanintelligence operation known as Operation Paperdip. Like I say, the Nazimentality did not end in 1943, it merely donned white coats and business suits.People using the esoteric knowledge positively are able to “hear” psychicguidance and see other dimensions. Others are able to leave their bodies andexperience those dimensions in a non-physical state; to tune their consciousnessinto the “future”, as with Nostradamus; and to project powerful thought formswhich affect the world positively. Those using this knowledge negatively can doprecisely the same. What we callPicture #58 [images/img_0058.png]45voodoo is the ability to implant thought forms into another person’s energyfield, causing them illness, pain, or mental and emotional distress. The mindcontrols the body and so it is possible to programme someone’s mind to make thebody die. This is how some public figures die of “natural causes” at the mostconvenient times from the Elite’s point of view. This brings me to informationyou sure as hell ought to know about.All over the world are millions of mind-controlled zombie slaves under theconstant influence of those in the secret network who have programmed them orknow the means to activate that programming. These slaves include men, women,and children as young as two and three. Hundreds of thousands of people go“missing” every year in the United States never to be seen again. Still more doso in South America and elsewhere. What happens to these people? Some of themare abducted by the Elite-controlled “intelligence” agencies and their offshootsand used for Nazi-style genetic experimentation and mindcontrol projects. Many,yes at least many, of the people who talk of being abducted by “aliens” andtaken into spaceships for experimentation have actually been abducted by humans.Abducting someone, wiping their mind of that memory, and replacing it with ahypnotic suggestion that they were abducted by “aliens” is child’s play today tothese people working in the secret military and scientific establishments in theUnited States, the United Kingdom, and around the world. When those peoplebecome conscious they genuinely believe they were abducted by “aliens” when, infact, it was really a very powerful hypnotic suggestion. Many are also found tohave been impregnated with microchips. The fear of extraterrestrial “aliens” isanother aspect of the manipulation of human perception on the road to totalcontrol. They are planning to “reveal” details of an extraterrestrial “invasion”of the Earth to justify the immediate creation of a world government and army.Ahhh! Save us from the aliens! We are already being conditioned for this and theUFO investigation network is being used to spread this disinformation, as isHollywood through films like Independence Day. I can picture the scene now. TheUS President with stern face and ominous tone announces that knowledge ofextraterrestrial activity has been suppressed for decades to avoid global panic.But now the situation is so grave that the world has to be told of the imminentthreat of an extraterrestrial invasion. The only way to meet this threat, wewill be told, is to forget our differences and come together as “one” (worldgovernment and world army). That is not toPicture #59 [images/img_0059.png]46say that I reject the idea of abductions by extraterrestrials, nor that theyplay a significant part in the manipulation of this world. I believe they do.The point I wish to emphasise is that this situation can be used to dupe us intoaccepting things we would not normally accept so readily, such as a world army,government and so on. I am increasingly convinced that far from invading theEarth today, the extraterrestrials have been here for thousands of years atleast, and in many forms. My next book will include more details on this.One method of creating human robots is called Multiple Personality Disorder(MPD), also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This involvescompartmentalising a person’s mind into a series of programmed “personalities”,each of which is triggered by a word, sentence, sound or action. Eachcompartment of the mind is unconnected to the others. So one minute you areoperating in a certain “personality” and the next, after the trigger word oraction, you lock into another. It’s like moving a dial on the radio and pickingup another station. What’s more, unless you are skillfully deprogrammed, youdon’t remember anything as the “dial” keeps moving. It is exactly the sameprinciple as compartmentalising the global pyramid in the way I describedearlier. Even this technique is primitive compared with the latest methods.People, or rather zombies, in a programmed state are used for many things. Theyare activated to carry out assassinations, as with the killers ofJohn Lennon andRobert Kennedy. This is why so many assassinations are performed by people withthe same mental profile - the so called “lone nutters.” They are neither alonenor, in most cases, insane if they were allowed to live in their natural state.They are programmed beings, often, as we shall see, since childhood. By thismethod, you can, for instance, plant a terrorist bomb and ensure that the personyou want to be blamed for it is in the right place at the right time for him tobe accused and charged with the outrage. You can also programme that person’smind while in custody to ensure that he even thinks he was involved. Theinfamous CIA mind-controller called Dr Lewis Jolyn “Jolly” West, who featuresstrongly in ... and the truth shall set you free, has, it appears, been workingwith Timothy McVeigh, theThere is speculation about whether the mind-controlled Sirhan Sirhan actuallydelivered the fatal shots in the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the brother ofJFK, in 1968. But he was certainly there with a gun and this allowed him to bejailed for the murder while the real killer and those who arranged theprogramming got away with it. See ... and the truth shall set you free.Picture #60 [images/img_0060.png]47microchipped former US soldier who is accused of the Oklahoma bombing. West wasinvolved with the appalling US Government mindcontrol project known as MKUltraand one of his keenest supporters was the then Governor of California, laterPresident of the United States, Ronald Reagan.We have also seen a spate of “lone nutters” in a number of countries who commitmass murder by going apparently crazy with guns. In the United Kingdom we havehad horrific examples of this in the little towns of Hungerford in Berkshire andDunblane in Scotland. A “nutter” called Thomas Hamilton walked into a school inDunblane and opened fire on little children in the gymnasium. The affect on thecollective psyche of hundreds of millions of people across the world,especially, of course, in the UK, was devastating. Shortly after that came themassacre in Port Arthur, a small town in Tasmania, Australia, when another lonegunmen went “crazy.” This was followed in England by a guy attacking childrenand their teachers with a machete at a school in Wolverhampton. What goes onhere? Look at the profiles of such people. They have a “background” of being abit strange or “simple” - “not the full quid” as neighbours described the PortArthur killer, Martin Bryant. This is perfect when you want them and theirhorrors to be dismissed as the work of a lone nutter. In Bryant’s case he hadjust returned from a two week stay in the United States when he went beserk withhis gun. People close to him said his character had changed after he came backfrom the US. It has been shown that terrorist groups like the IRA have what theycall “sleepers”, people who lie low unused for years, even decades, untilcircumstances arrive in which they and their cover can be exploited for aparticular task. It is the same in this world of mindcontrol. There are peopleprogrammed to live in the community with a certain character profile until thetime comes when they can be used. They are known in the “trade” as “dead eyes”.They have no idea that they are being used in this way because they are not incontrol of their minds, their programmers are. There are so many unansweredquestions, interestingly, about why the Dunblane killer, Thomas Hamilton, wasallowed to legally keep guns when his strange behaviour should have ensured hislicence was refused. And why did the police in Port Arthur take an hour torespond when the scene of the massacre was close to the police station and theyhad been informed within minutes of Bryant’s first shots? Also, Bryant, Hamiltonand so many other people who go crazy in this way arePicture #61 [images/img_0061.png]48reportedly taking the drug Prozac, a widely prescribed anti-depressant producedby Eli Lilly, a company closely connected to George Bush. Side effects includenervousness, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, hypomania and violent behaviour whenthe drug is withdrawn. Doctors are warned not to prescribe Prozac to anyone witha history of “mania”.So what is the motivation behind such massacres? Answer: The manipulation of themind and emotions. Where did these mass murders take place? Not in the ganglandareas of London, Glasgow, or Sydney, but in quiet little communities whereeveryone felt perfectly safe. In the same way, the “McVeigh” bomb was notplanted in New York or Washington, but in Oklahoma. We would be advised not tounderestimate the effect on the collective psyche in terms of fear and a desirefor the authorities to “protect” people from that fear. That means more camerasin the streets and more security guards and cameras in schools so that childrenare brought up to accept the culture of being “protected” from danger by bigbrother authority. A front page headline in, I think, the London Daily Mailencompassed the very reaction the manipulators wanted to stimulate. It saidafter the Australia killings: Is nowhere in the world safe anymore? When thesethings happen in quiet communities, it encourages even more powerfully theresponse of “My God, this could happen to me and my children. Hey, we needprotection”. A traumatised mind is also far more susceptible to mindmanipulation. The Global Elite also want to remove all guns from the generalpopulation in preparation for their final coup d’etat. No-one wants to rid theworld of weapons more than me, but we need to ask about the motivation behindthe immense pressure for gun laws inspired by... Hungerford, Dunblane, Tasmania,Oklahoma, etc, etc. Problem-reaction-solution. Getting hold of illegal weaponsis so easy that gun laws would not stop anyone who really wanted to kill. Thegun used by Martin Bryant in Port Arthur was stolen and he had no licence. Gunlaws would, however, prevent the population from defending itself from the HIGs- the Hoodlums In Government, as the scientist Wilhelm Reich used to call them.I wouldn’t use a gun to save my life. I don’t see the point of using violence tooppose violence, but many people would and the Elite know that. Hence they wantan unarmed population. Adolf Hitler introduced gun laws shortly before he beganto transport people to his concentration camps. Similar camps or “holdingfacilities” have already been built in the United States by an organisationcalledPicture #62 [images/img_0062.png]49FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was set up by ZbigniewBrzezinski, the man who launched the Trilateral Commission with DavidRockefeller.Mind-controlled human robots are also used to pass messages between peopleoutside the normal channels. These include unofficial communications betweenworld leaders and between personnel within the Global Elite-CIA controlledillegal drags network which involves presidents of the United States and manyother world leaders and officials. People programmed through MultiplePersonality Disorder apparently develop a photographic memory. The words of thecommunication are dictated under a form of hypnosis and then compartmentalised,often using a high voltage stun gun which lowers blood sugar levels and makesthe person more open to suggestion. Later a trigger word, sentence, or action,activates that personality and the human robot repeats the message word for wordlike a recorded tape. I have no doubt that some world leaders are themselvesunder the influence of mind-control by their handlers and I am convinced that awell known politician in the UK, with his distant eyes and fixed smile, is undersome sort of mental influence and controlled by one of his most prominent “spindoctors”.Most sickeningly, the robots, including very small children, are used to providebizarre sex for presidents, foreign leaders, politicians, and businessmen whothe Elite either wish to encourage into their way of thinking or to compromiseand blackmail into doing as they are told. When I say bizarre, I mean it, and Idon’t find the information that follows easy to write or speak about. But it isso important that this veil is lifted, not least for those who are beingsubjected now, this minute, to some of the grotesque evil that I shall expose.For the most obvious of reasons these human robots are rarely able to talk aboutwhat has happened to them. They are either in zombie mode and can’t remember or,when they are passed their sell-by date from the manipulators’ perspective, theyare murdered and sometimes their body parts are used for the unspeakable blackmagic rituals often attended by some very famous people. You think you know thepersonalities of people you see on the television? Please read on. Fortunately,one very brave woman who was mind-controlled as a young child has now spoken outafter escaping from US government slavery. She was taken through long andpainstaking deprogramming sessions lasting more than a year which broke down thecompartments in her mind and allowed her to remember everything that happened toher - and whoPicture #63 [images/img_0063.png]50did it. She is Cathy O’Brien, an American of Irish decent, who has produced aself-published book about her experiences called TranceFormation Of America.2 Itis a stunning tale she has to tell. But there have been thousands, probablymillions, more like her - still are -and that will continue to be the case untilhumanity wakes up to its responsibilities. Because of her photographic memory,Cathy can describe in great detail the conversations she heard, the rooms anddecor in the White House, the Pentagon and top secret military establishmentsacross the US. She can also describe physical details of the people involvedwhich she could only know if she had seen them naked.Catlileen (Cathy) Ann O’Brien was born in 1957 in Muskegor Michigan. Her fatherEarl O’Brien is a paedophile and one of Cathy’s first memories was being unableto breathe because his t)enis was in her mouth. Such trauma automaticallytriggers Multiple Per onality Disorder without any need for programming becausethe child’s own mind wishes to shut out the horror. It compartmental’ses theexperience in the same way that people can’t remember road accidents they areinvolved in. Her father’s friends were also allowed to abuse and rape the youngCathy and her brothers, just as her father and mother had been abused aschildren. Her mother was sexually abused by Cathy’s grandfather, the leader of aMasonic Blue Lodge. Her nother’s brother, “Uncle Bob\" to Cathy, was a pilot inAirforce Intelligence who claimed that he worked for the Vatican. “Uncle Bob”who is also a commercial pornographer and Cathy’s father forced her and I rolder brother, Bill, to take part in pornographic films made for the localMichigan Mafia which was connected, she says, to the “Pom King\" Gerald Ford,then a US Representative. He would later be the Vice President of the UnitedStates under Richard Nixon and President when Nixon was ousted by Watergate, anoutcome inspired by the Washington Post, owned by Katherine Graham (BilderbergGroup, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations). Ford also served onthe Warren Commission “investigating\" the assassination of President Kennedy.While Cathy O’Brien was a little child at school, she says she was raped byGerald Ford in the office of Michigan State Senator, Guy VanderJagt, who alsoraped her. VanderJagt would become the chairman of the Republican2 Trance-Formation Of America is available from Brigadoon Books,1 The OldBakery, Mill Street, Aberfeldy, Perthshire PH15 2BT, Scotland or from Bridge ofLove, c/o 13553 Poway Road, #170 Poway, California 92064, USAPicture #64 [images/img_0064.png]51Party National Congressional Committee which supported George Bush, anotherchild rapist named in Cathy’s book, in his successful campaign to becomePresident of the United States.Eventually, Cathy’s father, it appears, was caught sending child pornographythrough the post - a film of young Cathy having sex with a boxer dog. To avoidprosecution Cathy was, in effect, handed over by her father to the United StatesGovernment and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Her father was delighted withthe deal because he was now immune from prosecution and could continue hispornography and paedophile activities while the authorities looked the otherway. The Agency was searching for sexually abused children with MultiplePersonality Disorder who came from families with a history of intergenerationalchild abuse. They wanted the children for their studies into geneticmind-control which operated under the title Project Monarch, an offshoot of thenotorious, MKUltra. (I understand that MK stands for Mind Kontrolle - the Germanspelling of K replacing the C in deference to the Nazis, formerly serving underHitler, who inspired the project.) The man who arrived at Cathy’s house to giveher father the ultimatum of hand over your daughter or be prosecuted was...Gerald Ford. Cathy’s father was sent to Harvard University near Boston to beinstructed in how to prepare his daughter for the mad professors of theGovernment agencies. Cathy says in her book:... in keeping with his government-provided instructions, my father beganworking me like the legendaiy Cinderella. I shovelled fireplace ashes, hauledand stacked firewood, raked leaves, shovelled snow chopped ice, and swept -‘because ’, my father said, ‘your little hands fit so nicely around the rake,mop, shovel, and broom handles... 'By this time my father's exploitation of meincluded prostitution to his friends, local mobsters and Masons, relatives,Satanists, strangers, and police officers...... Government researchers involved in MKUltra Project Monarch knew about thephotographic memory aspect of MPD/DID, of course, as well as other resultant‘5uper human ’ characteristics. Visual acuity of an MPD/DID is 44 times greaterthan that of the average person.My developed unusually high pain threshold, plus compartmentalisation of memory,were ‘necessary’ for military and covert operations applications. Additionally,my sexuality was primitively twisted from infancy. This programming wasappealing and useful to perversePicture #65 [images/img_0065.png]52politicians who believed they could bide their actions deep within my memorycompartments, which clinicians refer to as personalities. ” 3You think slavery exists Only in history? Slavery is happening all over theworld today, including, no especially, in the United States and other“civilised” countries like the United Kingdom. The paedophile rings make thenews from time to time, but they are the tiniest tip of a vast network that goesright to the top (sorry gutter) of “free” societies. The truth about the abuseof boys at the Kincora Home in Northern Ireland was suppressed because one ofthe abusers was an agent of British Intelligence. It also involved at least onefamous politician in Northern Ireland, but this fact has been covered up, notleast by a now retired official of British Intelligence called Ian Cameron. Suchchild abuse networks provide the perfect vehicle to satisfy the sexual desiresof those in control and for blackmailing those they wish to control. I want thenames of those involved in whatever country you live in. If you know something,please tell me. The information will be in the strictest confidence and if itcan be substantiated I will make it public. If you hesitate, just think aboutthe children.Cathy O’Brien says she was abused by Father James Thaylen when she soughtcomfort at a Roman Catholic Church called St. Francis de Sales in Muskegon andanother priest, a Father Don, was a paedophile who helped Gerald Ford’s friend,Guy Vanderjagt, to confuse and abuse her in line with the “requirements” ofProject Monarch. Later she was sent to a Roman Catholic School, one of many usedby the government to safely house their mind-controlled children under thestrict regime designed to increase the depth of their Multiple PersonalityDisorder. Her school was Muskegon Catholic Central High School where she wasraped by Father Vesbit many times, on one occasion during a Satanic ritualinvolving other mind-controlled boys and girls in his private chapel. The RomanCatholic Church is the epitome of hypocrisy and deeply, deeply sick. The “RomanCatholic” Jesuit movement is an important vehicle for the manipulation of theglobal conspiracy and, like the Knights of Malta who help to control theVatican, it does not even believe in Christianity! That’s just a front. Thewhole conspiracy is masks, smoke, and mirrors. The Jesuits, the Knights ofMalta, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy are part of the Illuminati - theIlluminated3 Trance-Formation Qf America, p83Picture #66 [images/img_0066.png]53Ones. They were, and are, keen supporters of mind-control outrages like ProjectMonarch and MKUltra. How appropriate given that the Roman Catholic Church hassurvived only by terrifying, brainwashing, and mind-controlling its globalcongregation. One Jesuit front for the conspiracy is the “charity”, WorldVision. Cathy was pressured and manipulated by the CIA’s Roman Catholic branchinto keeping secrets from a young age through a technique known as the kite toRemain Silent and there were so many secrets to keep locked away in hercompartmentalised mind. In the years that followed she says she was under thecontrol of the US “Democrat” Senator for West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, and herabuse by him and the government agencies expanded. Byrd is a “constitutional”expert working to undermine and destroy the American Constitution. She claimsthat Byrd controls a network of mind-controlled slaves and loves nothing morethan to whip them mercilessly until they are close to death.4 One of Byrd’sassociates, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would later torture Cathy byputting a needle in her eye while her daughter, Kelly, was forced to watch.Leahy was vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and served onByrd’s Senate Appropriations Committee. Leahy and Byrd played out a public gameof “opposing” each other while actually working together to the same goals. Thesame masquerade goes on in the parliaments of the world. Byrd, a cocaineaddict,5 often bragged to “safe” people of how he mind-controlled PresidentJimmy Carter while he was Carter’s “confidant and advisor”. The hypnotic voiceof Byrd became the “voice of God” to a praying and meditating Carter whofaithfully followed the “guidance” he believed was divine.6 Remember what I saidabout the mind-influenced UK politician?Cathy’s torture and mind-control was inflicted at many government establishmentsaround the States, including the NASA Space and Rocket Centre at Huntsville,Alabama, where she and, later, her daughter, Kelly, were used for pornographicfilms. Yes, “man-on-the moon”, “space shuttle”, NASA does all this. Religionsare used constantly to manipulate people and as a “respectable” cover fortorture and mind manipulation. One centre of Cathy’s mind programming was SaltLake City, Utah, the headquarters of the Mormon “Church”.4 Trance-Formation Of America, p 915 Contact newspaper, The Phoenix Project, February 7th 1995, pl7.6 Ibid p 18.Picture #67 [images/img_0067.png]54Another establishment for mind-controlling slaves is known as the “Charm School”at Youngstown, Ohio. This is a “sex slave” training “school” where Cathy, Kelly,and a stream of other women and children were (are) tortured and abused withelectric shocks, sleep deprivation, and sexual trauma. Cathy says an unnamedmember of the Mellon banking family was the “governor” of the Charm School andother well known people involved were US Representative, Jim Traficant, and DickThornburgh, then Governor for Pennsylvania and later US Attorney General andSecretary for the United Nations.7While still a child, Cathy was raped, abused, and tortured, by some very famouspeople. She says that she was raped by Pierre Trudeau, the long-time primeminister of Canada who, as a Jesuit, was working closely with the Vatican; rapedagain by Gerald Ford when he was actually President; raped by Ronald Reaganwhile he was President; and raped many times in the most brutal fashion by DickCheney, the White Fiouse Chief of Staff under Ford and the Defense Secretary ofthe United States under George Bush. Cathy is able to describe Cheney’s officein the Pentagon in great detail. If you accept Cathy’s highly detailed evidenceyou can only conclude that Cheney, like Bush, is an immensely imbalanced mindcapable of staggering violence and even murder. Cathy says that Cheney told heron one occasion: “I could kill you - kill you - with my bare hands. You’re notthe first and you won’t be the last.”8 These were the characters who launchedthe Gulf War to show that “violence does not pay”! Cheney, Bush, and others have“fun” playing something they call A Most Dangerous Game, Cathy documents. Itinvolves threatening government slaves like Cathy and other mind-controlledchildren and adults with appalling consequences if they are caught in the game.They are then allowed to “escape” into a forest, usually in some top secretmilitary area like Lampe, Missouri, and Mount Shasta, California, which aresurrounded by a high fence to prevent any escape. George Bush, the man whocalled for a “kinder, gentler, America”, Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton often goafter them with guns, Cathy writes in her book. When they are caught, they arebrutally raped, sometimes killed. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the people weallow to control the world. The Mount Shasta compound, where Bush and Cheneyshared an office, is, according to Cathy: “The largest, covert mind-controlslave camp of7 Trance-Formation Of America, pi 15.8 Ibid pi00.Picture #68 [images/img_0068.png]55which I am aware ”9There she saw an enormous fleet of unmarked blackhelicopters, which, as researchers have revealed, are part of the New WorldOrder’s private army which is being installed to instigate the coup d’etat whenthe moment is deemed right. These helicopters have often been reported near thescenes of “alien abductions” and cattle mutilations. Part of the cover for thesemilitary and mind-control operations at the Shasta Compound, Cathy says, is thecountry music scene at Lake Shasta.Cathy was forced to marry a mind-controlled Satanist called Wayne Cox, a memberof the Jack Greene country music band. Greene, a CIA operative, was also aSatanist.10 Cox’s job was to further traumatise her to create more compartmentswhich could be used to programme new “personalities:’ One night, Cox took Cathywith him to the mins of the Union Railway Station in Nashville and, using aflashlight, found a homeless man asleep. He ordered Cathy to “Kiss the railroadbum good-bye” and proceeded to shoot him in the head. That was horrific enough,but he then produced a machete and chopped off the man’s hands before puttingthem into a zipper bag.11 As Cathy has stated at public meetings many times,Wayne Cox is a serial killer who invariably chops off the hands of his prey. Inan interview published in the Contact newspaper, Cathy said:“By 1978, Wayne Cox, my first designated controller, was actively rituallymurdering and dismembering bums, children, and those who ‘wouldn't be missed’and blatantly distributing body parts from his Chatham, Louisiana home base tokey Satanic capitals of several states which included the Little Rock /Missouriroute. “12Government agencies know this, but he is immune from prosecution because heworks for them. Cox led Cathy to another spot on the Union Station site, a towerat the old railroad depot, and waiting in a room for them was Jack Greene,members of his band and others, dressed in black robes. They were standingaround a black leather altar. The room was draped in red velvet and lit bycandles. Cathy was laid on the alter and subjected to rape and torture while theSatanists performed a black9 Trance-Formation Of America, pi 94.10 Ibid plOl.\"Ibid.12 Contact newspaper, March 7th 1995, p33.Picture #69 [images/img_0069.png]56magic ritual that involved sex, blood, and cannibalism.13 Years later when“married” to another CIA asset, Alex Houston, she would be made pregnant andartificially aborted many times so the foetus could be used for Satanic rituals.My friends, this is going on all over the world and it involves some of the bestknown people on the planet. There is a sexual “playground” for leading Americanand foreign politicians, mobsters, etc, involved in the Cult of the All SeeingEye and the New World Order. It is called Bohemian Grove in Northern Californiaand here Cathy was forced to serve their perversions. These include Satanicrituals, torture, sacrifices, and drinking blood. No, I’m not kidding. Regularattenders of this Satanic centre are known as “Grovers” and people like Clinton,Bush and Ford are among them, Cathy says. Other researchers have linked HenryKissinger with Bohemian Grove. All that I am describing is founded on the abuseof esoteric knowledge - black magic - and the constant sexual theme relates tothe power of sexual energy, which I will explain in a later chapter. The globalSatanic network is also a pyramid with the Global Elite and the Cult of the AllSeeing Eye at the peak. These people are, in turn, under the domination of the“Lucifer”/”Satan” consciousness which controls its “personnel” through mind andemotional possession. The Satanic child abuse rings which are all too rarelyexposed are, in fact, part of a coordinated global network that goes to the topof the pyramid. This is why so many world leaders are involved in Satanic childabuse. The Cult of the All Seeing Eye is based on Satanism and the black use ofesoteric knowledge and this same cult controls the appointments to the majorpolitical, economic, and administrative posts in the world. Therefore you findthat a staggeringly high proportion of people in the top jobs are peopleconnected to this cult and its sexual abuses. The best actors are in Hollywood?No, no, they are in the parliaments and political parties.One of those who controlled Cathy O’Brien was Lt Colonel Michael Aquino of theUS Army, a top man in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Psychological WarfareDivision. I have named him in my last two books as the head of a “Satanicchurch”14 known as the Temple of Set, an organisation inspired, apparently, bythe leader of Hitler’s SS,13 Trance-Formation Of America, plOl14 Cathy says that Aquino does not himself believe in \"Satan”. He believes Satanis merely the ability to mind-control. But what is it that motivates his mind toact in such ways?Picture #70 [images/img_0070.png]57Heinrich Himmler. When it was exposed that America’s Psychological Warfare wasbeing headed by a Neo-Nazi from a “Satanic” church, the official response wasthat a man’s religion was his own business!! But, as Cathy soon found out,people like Aquino and the rest of this deeply disturbed and possessed bunch areabove the law, because their mentality controls the law right up to thepresident and beyond. Planet Earth is possessed by an extreme negativeconsciousness and these people are merely the physical expression of that.Again, later in the book, I will discuss the source of this consciousnessrepresented by the All Seeing Eye.Cathy conceived a child, Kelly, with her “husband”, Wayne Cox, and soon Kellywas being used in the same way as her mother. Cathy says that Kelly was rapedmany times by George Bush and Dick Cheney and both mother and daughter wereforced to have sex with animals for videos made on the orders of PresidentRonald Reagan. “Uncle Ron” liked nothing more than to watch these videos andthey were known as “Uncle Ronnie’s bedtime stories”.15 They were recorded andproduced, Cathy says, by his pornographer, Michael Dante’ (also known as MichaelViti). Dante’ had connections with the Mafia and the CIA (same thing, mostly),and was a close associate of politicians like Guy VanderJagt, Gerald Ford, DickThornburgh, then Governor of Pennsylvania, Jim Traficant, and Gary Ackerman.16It was Dant& who installed the tiny hidden cameras which recorded the sexualactivities of US and foreign politicians so they could be blackmailed intosupporting the New World Order. How many “leaders” today are following certainpolicies against the interests of the people because if they didn’t the evidenceof their sexual exploits would be revealed? Reagan’s leading pornographer was aman called Larry Flynt who ran the pornography magazine, Hustler.17 He, too, hadCIA, Mafia and Vatican connections.18Bill Clinton was compromised in this way on one occasion by his boss, oops,sorry, “opponent”, George Bush. It happened at the Lampe, Missouri, mind-controlfacility known as Swiss Villa. Bush ordered Kelly to perform oral sex on Clintonwhile Clinton was doing the same with Cathy. She recalls the following exchange:15 Trance-Formation Of America, pl27.16 Ibid, pl28.17 Ibid, pill.18 Ibid, pi 62.Picture #71 [images/img_0071.png]58“Clinton pushed his way out from urider me, and told Bush while he glancedaround for the camera: ‘You didn 't need to do that. I’m with you anyway. Myposition does not need to be compromised. ’ Clinton was apparently referring tothe blackmail tactics amongst the Order of the Rose [All Seeing Eye] Elite.World leaders were always compromised through covertly filmed bizarre sexualactivity as was my experience at the Bohemian Grove.After this encounter, Bush and Clinton discussed introducing Clinton’s daughter,Chelsea, to the child abuse scene. Bush offered to open her up”. Clinton said hewould have to discuss it with Hillary.20Cathy says that she and Kelly were also raped by another Canadian PrimeMinister, Brian Mulroney, who is addicted to sex with mindcontrolled slaves.21Mind-controlled mothers and young daughters were (are?) regularly transported toNiagara Falls just across the Canadian border for Mulroney to rape them.22 Itwas Mulroney in his period as prime minister who forced upon the Canadianpeople, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is set to becomethe American version of the European Union. The Agreement was manipulated intoexistence by his fellow child rapist, George Bush, and later by Bill Clinton.Under the orders of President Reagan’s personal attache’, Philip Habib, Cathysays she was forced to have sex on several occasions with the New World Orderstooge, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi “royal family” serve as puppets ofthe Global Elite while suppressing their people with a brutal religion whichthey, themselves, do not even begin to observe. American mind-controlled slavesare also “sold” to Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and other countries to help fund thecovert operations of the Cult of the All Seeing Eye.Cathy was so powerfully mind-controlled that she was “promoted” to become whatis known as a Presidential Model, a mind-controlled slave who is detailed tooperate with the top people in the White House. She was used to pass messagesbetween Reagan, Bush, and their foreign associates such as the dictators, BabyDoc Duvalier of Haiti, President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico, and ManuelNoriega of Panama, a paid CIA operative working for the US Government’s illegal19 Contact newspaper, September 12th 1995, pl5.20 Ibid.21 Trance-Formation Of America, pi 83.22 Ibid pi 78.Picture #72 [images/img_0072.png]59drag trade. As I have explained in detail in previous books, Bill Clinton andGeorge Bush are both drag addicts involved in running drags on a massive scale.Clinton is addicted to cocaine while Bush’s preferred drag is heroin. GeraldFord is another drag runner. These facts are confirmed by Cathy’s directexperiences. The world market in illegal drags is controlled by the White Houseand the US/global intelligence/ organised crime network to make vast amounts ofmoney for covert operations designed to implement the global domination of theNew World Order and to destabilise society to make people easier to control.Noriega was closely involved with this during the Reagan-Bush years and it wasonly when Noriega and Bush fell out that Bush sent US troops into Panama toremove him. Bush replaced him in Panama with another character connected to theSouth American drag trade and Noriega was taken to the United States to bejailed for drag offences!Cathy observed one “party” attended by Air Force officials and their wives, dragbarons like the Pueto Rican, Jose Busto, and the “hero” (I feel ill) of theIran-Contra drags-for-arms scandal, Oliver North. Large amounts of cocaine werelaid out for their use. Upstairs were Noriega, Michael Aquino, and Senator AllenSimpson, the “Republican” from Wyoming.23 While all this was going on, GeorgeBush was having a war on drags” to “save the American children”. Cocaine addict.Bill Clinton, would later do the same. In the midst of Clinton’s “war of drags”,he ended drags tests for White House staff because so many of his associatesrunning the country were also addicts! I’m going to wake up in a minute, I’msure of it. Cathy met Clinton a few times and on one occasion in Arkansas he wastrying (successfully) to persuade a supporter, Bill Hall, to become involved inthe drag trade. Hall need not worry, Clinton said, because it was “Reagan’soperation”. Clinton told Hall in Cathy’s then mind-controlled presence:“Bottom line is, we’ve got control of the (drug) industry, therefore we’ve gotcontrol of them (suppliers and buyers). You control the guy underneath you andUncle (Uncle Sam, the United States Government) has you covered. What have yougot to lose? No risk. No-one’s going to hang you out to diy. And whatever spillsoff the truck as it passes through (Clinton laughed here and snorted anothernoseful of cocaine) you get to clean up. ”2423 Trance-Formation Of America, p 15024 Ibid pl55.Picture #73 [images/img_0073.png]60Later that night Cathy says she was taken by Bill Hall’s wife to meet HillaryClinton at the Hall’s guest villa. There Mrs Clinton, another cocaine user,25performed oral sex on Cathy and then insisted it was done to her.26 BothPresident Clinton and his “first” lady knew Cathy was a mind-controlled slaveand they know what is going on. They keep quiet because they are part of what isgoing on. Cathy acted as a robotic messenger for Clinton who was very adept attriggering her programming, as she has stated publicly many times. Bob Doleknows what is going on, too, and yet nothing is done.Clinton and Bush may seem to be opponents in “different” political parties, butthey are part of the same scam, the New World Order. Cathy O’Brien has confirmedfrom her own direct experience what researchers have been suggesting for years:Bush was President during the “Reagan” years, President through his own“official” period in the Oval Office, and pulled the strings again during the“Clinton” regime. Bush was bom into the Cult of the All Seeing Eye. His father,Prescott Bush, helped to fund Adolf Hitler.27 These two “opponents”, George Bush(CFR, TC, 33rd degree Freemason, All Seeing Eye) and Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil,33rd degree Freemason, All Seeing Eye) are on the same side, involved in thesame rackets. At the 4992 election the two “opposed” each other to present theillusion of a “democratic” society. Cathy met Bush and Clinton together yearsbefore Clinton was even considered a presidential possible. She once observedthem at Swiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri. The “infirmary” on the site is home to aCIA near-death trauma centre. Cathy, under her mind-control, had delivered alarge amount of cocaine there in a motorhome when she saw the two futurepresidents:1 noticed then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at a comertable with Hillary talking to the then Vice-President George Bush, and their twospecial forces “toy soldiers” (mind-controlled) who had transferred the cocaineto the infirmary building. (My mind-control owner US Senator Robert Byrd, toldme that Bush and others had been grooming Bill Clinton for the presidency ‘inthe event that the American public becomes disillusioned with republicans andbelieve that electing a democrat would make a difference’. Clinton obedientlyfollowed25 Contact newspaper, September 12th 1995.26 Trance-Formation Of America, p 155.27 This is all doenmented in great detail in ... and the truth shall set youfree.Picture #74 [images/img_0074.png]61Bush’s orders. Since the implementation of what Hitler termed New World Orderknew no party lines, the question should be raised as to the agenda of Clinton’s1992 presidential campaign manager James Carville, and his wife Mary Matalin,who was Bush’s campaign manager.) ” 28Another Clinton-Bush connection is their love of hunting mindcontrolled men,women and children, in The Most Dangerous Game. Cathy O’Brien told the Contactnewspaper in the US about one of her experiences at Swiss Villa when Clinton andBush went “hunting” with dogs for hersel { her daughter Kelly and twomind-controlled “toy soldiers”, one of whom had Italian-looking features:“Swiss Villa appeared deserted, except for Bill Clinton and George Bush, whostood at the edge of the woods with their hunting dogs at the ready to embark on‘The Most Dangerous Game ’ of human hunting.(Clinton shared Bush’s passion for traumatising and hunting humans.)... Bush and Clinton were dressed alike in camouflage pants, army boots and windbreakers. The two also shared the trademark of wearing a cap of cryptic meaning.This time, Bush’s camouflage cap had an orange insignia that said ‘Dear Hunter’.Clinton’s blue cap read ‘Aim High ' and had a picture of a rifle on it. Clintonappeared awkward with his hunting rifle, while Bush looked like an expertmarksman with his black rifle with elaborate scope.“ ‘The rules of the game are simple ’ Bush began, triggering me by using thesame words that always preceded a Most Dangerous Game.“Clinton interrupted ‘You run. We hunt. ’“Bush continued: 'This will be called “Hunt for a virgin ” (Clinton chuckled)and she’s it. ’ He pointed to Kelly who was still in my arms. 1 catch you, she’smine.“Clinton spoke up: ‘You ’ll have plenty of time to play with the dogs becausethey’ll have you pinned down while we... ’ (he slid a bullet in the chamber foremphasis) ‘...hunt down the bigger game. ’ Clinton glared at the “toy soldier ”with the waxy face. (Toy soldier was a term2S Contact newspaper, September 12th 1995, pl2.Picture #75 [images/img_0075.png]621 often heard referring to the mind-controlled robotic ‘5pecial forces ’ youngmen who operated wider the New World Order.)\"The two guys ran for the woods. Carrying Kelly, 1 began running too. Judgingfrom the close proximity of the dog barks, I had not gone far when they wereturned loose. The five barking dogs caught me right away and surrounded me.Kelly screamed as one snapped at her leg and I automatically slapped at itsface. I was convinced the dogs were going to tear us up by the time Bush andClinton walked into the clearing. They seemed to be engaged in a seriousconversation until Bush looked up and smiled.“ ‘She’s mine ’ he claimed (referring to Kelly) ‘But then, she always has been.Let go. ’\"As 1 walked past Clinton, who was still deep in thought, he mumbled: 7 thoughtyou ’d be fucking a dog or something. ’ We walked the short way back in silencewith Clinton veering off to the right as Bush directed me toward the twohelicopters...\"The door (of the helicopter) next to me slid open and Clinton pushed theItalian into the helicopter. 7 caught this one. He's going to ride jumpseat. ’Bush motionedfor him to sit in the leather chair marked for death by the blackrose, while I rode in the actual jumpseat”.‘ ‘ ‘Come here, little one ’ Bush coaxed Kelly. ‘You can sit on Uncle George'slap. ’ He lifted her onto his lap as Clinton got in front with the pilot, whowas starting the engines. ‘Over the lake, Jake 'Bush told the pilot.\"Flying over Swiss Villa’s deep, remote lake, Bush set Kelly aside, stood up asfar as he was able in the helicopter and slid the door open. The powerful windblew Bush’s greasy strands from his face as he gestured for the man (theItalian) to stand up.‘Freefall'Bush instructed ‘That’s an order. ’“‘Yes, sir’ he replied as he stepped out of the door fully clad in hiscamouflage uniform and military boots - with no parachute. I watched in horroras he fell to his death in the water below, splatter and submerge.. “2929 Contact newspaper, September 12th 1995, pl3.Picture #76 [images/img_0076.png]63This is just one incident, one murder, in the lives of Bill Clinton and GeorgeBush, the men the people of the United States voted to be their presidents.Please tell me it can’t be true! The United States might lose its freedom? MyGod. America ceased to be free a long, long time ago if indeed it ever was.America is a one party fascist dictatorship while millions of Americans go onbelieving it is the land of the free.When the slaves outlive their usefulness or their programming begins to breakdown, they are murdered. The so called Presidential Models like Cathy O’Brienare not allowed to live beyond their 30th year and when that came for Cathy in1987/88, she was told it was her last year of life. Fortunately, she and thethen eight-year-old Kelly would be rescued from death by a businessman calledMark Phillips. Fie had a considerable knowledge of advanced mind-controltechniques from his time working for the Ampex Corporation and the US Departmentof Defense as a civilian subcontractor. This allowed him contact with theleading research scientists in this field and gave him access to knowledge thatis denied to the mainstream psychiatric profession. Psychiatrists, like doctorsand scientists, are also mind manipulated by the suppression of informationwhich gives them a distorted picture of what is possible. Mark Phillips wasthought to be “safe” because of his background and security clearance, and hewas approached by a man called Alex Flouston for support with a business deal.Flouston was now the “handler” of Cathy and Kelly and he married Cathy at theinstruction of her controller, Senator Robert C. Byrd.30)Alex Flouston, a rapist, paedophile, and drug runner, was an “entertainer”, aventriloquist and stage hypnotist, who himself had his mind and mouth worked bysomeone else - the US Government’s mindcontrol network. It was his job tomaintain Cathy and Kelly in their programmed mode by following the instructionshe was given, which included food and water deprivation and constant trauma.Houston used his travelling to venues as a cover to transport Cathy and Kelly totheir “assignments” and this introduced Cathy to the truth about the UnitedStates country music industry, and, indeed, the “entertainment” industry ingeneral. Country music, she discovered, was used by the US Government agenciesto distribute massive amounts of drugs into American society and as a cover forits mind-control projects. It was these agencies, she says, which paid for thepromotion and hype that turned a singer called Boxcar Willie into a countrymusic “star.” Some30 Trance-Formation Of America, pill.Picture #77 [images/img_0077.png]64of this promotion, Cathy says, took the form of high tech television commercialsdesigned to have a hypnotic affect on the viewer. He became the leader, shewrites, of the country music segment of the “Freedom Train” - theinternationally recognised code name for the slave operations of ProjectMonarch. The name “Boxcar Willie” was not selected at random. It makes astatement about the man and his role. Cathy names Boxcar Willie as a paedophilerapist of mindcontrolled women and children, including Kelly whom, she says, heraped regularly in three different mental institutions.31 He is also heavilyinvolved in the cocaine operations controlled by the government agencies and hewas the man Bill Clinton’s friend. Bill Hall, began to work with after Clintonpersuaded him to become involved.32 It was Boxcar Willie who inspired the movingof the country music “capital” to Branson, Missouri, to be close to theCIAmind-control and drags operation based at Lampe, Missouri.33Many people in the entertainment industry are either connected with theconspiracy or mind-controlled by it. One of the latter was Marilyn Monroe, a“lover” of President John F Kennedy. Both were to be murdered by the same force.Another mind-controlled singer, according to Cathy, is Lorretta Lynn, a slave ofthe CIA. Her mental and emotional problems were caused by this. Lorretta’s “roadmanager”, Ken Riley, is a paedophile and best friend to Cathy’s handler, AlexHouston. Both were connected with US Congressman, Gary Ackerman, the “Democrat”from New York, who, Cathy reports, ran an elaborate drag operation through LongIsland Docks.34 Another mind-controlled woman rescued by Mark Phillips wasSeidina “Dma” Reed, the daughter of actor-singer, Jerry Reed, of the group,Smokey And The Bandits. Seidina had been used many times with Cathy inpornographic films under the control of her husband, the sadist, David Rorick(also known as Dave Rowe). Rorick was trained in mind-control by Alex Houstonand Seidina’s famous father, Jerry Reed, knew all about it, according to MarkPhillips. Seidina was a favourite sex slave of Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, theSaudi Arabian Ambassador to the US.35 The singer, Kris Kristopherson, adrag-addicted alcoholic bom into a CIA family, is also involved as a seriouslyimbalanced controller and mind31 Trance-Formation Of America, pl56.32 Ibid.33 Contact newspaper, March 7th 1995, pp33-34.34 Trance-Formation Of America, pi 24.35 Ibid p31.Picture #78 [images/img_0078.png]65manipulator of slaves, according to Cathy’s book and public statements.36 Shewrites that she was tortured by him and Michael Aquino, using high voltageelectric shocks.37 Kristopherson, a Jesuit, is an associate of Senator Robert C.Byrd, Cathy’s controller.38 hi that position, Byrd was, in mind-controlparlance, said to be “married” to Cathy even though she was officially marriedto Alex Houston. Cathy says of Kristopherson in her book:“...Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis, which had furthersexually excited him, late in the Summer of 1987 during another incident relatedto Byrd. ”39Another world famous psychopath and drug runner for the government is the rockand roll “legend”, Jerry Lee Lewis. Cathy says she was threatened on manyoccasions with the words: “we’ll sell you to Jerry Lee”. This was the backgroundto Cathy and Kelly’s lives when Mark Phillips came on the scene. He worked withAlex Houston on a big business deal involving Hong Kong and China, but then hewas told by a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Defence about Houston’sbackground and his involvement with the CIA, drags, money laundering, childprostitution, and... slavery. Phillips’s informant, who produced documentaryproo { said Houston was a “very bad man” and that his crimes were “of the WhiteHouse”. Mark Phillips writes in Trance-Formation Of America:“My first response to this “officer \" was that Houston was too stupid andcrooked to be connected with US “intelligence”. This comment was quicklycountered with a gut wrenching photograph of Houston. He was smiling a demonicgrin while apparently having anal sex with a small, very young, frightened blackboy. Later he was identfliied to me as being Haitian. ” 40Phillips made contact with an old friend, now dead, who had been an Air ForceGeneral in the intelligence division and maintained close connections with theupper levels of US and foreign intelligence. The36 Trance-Formation Of America, pi 17.37 Ibid pi 18.38 Ibid.39 Ibidpl20.40 Ibid pl2.Picture #79 [images/img_0079.png]66General told him about the CIA slave trade worldwide and that Cathy and Kellyhad been subjected to trauma-based mind-control. Mark Phillips recalls:“I was growing numb. The first words out of my dry mouth were: ‘How would youspring these people out of it? ’ ”“He smiled and said: ‘Iwouldn’t! What are you going to do with them if you getthem out? ’ Before I could answer he interrupted and said: “Look. You ’re stillthe same, but nothing else is with Uncle (the USA). Now most of the CIA, FBI,and the MOB (Mafia) are the same, and they ’re making moves on the military. ”41Phillips was insistent that he wanted to attempt a rescue and his friend gavehim the mind-controlling codes (based on Christianity and God) that wouldactivate Cathy to go with him. The full and detailed story is told in their bookwhich I urge you most strongly to read. Phillips took them to Alaska whileleaving messages for the authorities that he had no intention of exposing thetmth. He said he would ... take them to Alaska and play like a voicelesschameleon”. This, as he hoped, probably spared their lives at this stage. Theyhave also been helped by many good people in intelligence who want to root outthe evil. There is an internal “war” unfolding. In Alaska, Mark Phillips usedhis knowledge, with covert support from his contacts, to deprogramme Cathy’scompartmentalised mind. This immense task absorbed almost every spare wakingmoment month after month after month. But he was successful and Cathy’s mind andmemory returned. What a story she now had to tell as she remembered with crystalclarity all that happened to her and Kelly. Sadly Kelly’s deprogramming provedeven more difficult and she suffers from severe asthma caused by the constanttrauma she has suffered. Attempts were made by the CIA mindcontroller, Dr LewisJolyn West, and his associates to take Kelly from Cathy and Mark and eventuallythe authorities used the “law” to ensure the United Fascist States of Americahad control of her once again. At the time of writing Kelly, aged just 16, is apolitical prisoner under the custody of the State of Tennessee. The media andpublic have been banned from court cases involving Kelly and she is denied theright to an independent attorney. The court has also banned the words41 Trance-Formation Of America, pp!3-14.Picture #80 [images/img_0080.png]67“President”, “politics”, “New World Order”, “mind-control” and “George Bush”.42Kelly and Cathy are never allowed to talk alone and talking in any way about thepast is forbidden. Mark Phillips, who saved Kelly from her torture by the state,is banned from even seeing her. The authorities refuse to de-programme Kellyfrom her Project Monarch-MKUltra mind-control by invoking the National SecurityAct (amended by Reagan in 1984) which allows them to use the excuse of “nationalsecurity”. They are terrified of what Kelly would remember. Whenever you seegovernments using the guise of “national security” to deny justice andinformation, what they really mean is the security of their own criminalbehaviour.Cathy and Mark have had their lives threatened many times, but they have senttheir information, with documented and sometimes audio tape support, to a streamof US politicians, government agencies, and pressure groups, including Bob Dole.Why no reaction, Mr Dole? They have also produced their astonishing book,Trance-Formation Of America, and spoken extensively at public meetings all overthe country. This has probably kept them alive because to kill them would merelyconfirm that what they say is true. And if Cathy’s claims are not true, where isthe legal action against her and the book? Most of the names involved are sowealthy that the cost of such an action would be no trouble. Why the silence inthe face of allegations as grave and extreme as these? If you wish to supportCathy and Mark in their campaign for justice you can write to them at P.0 Box158352, Nashville, Tennessee 37215.With her mind cleared of its compartments, Cathy was able to remember all thatshe had heard about the global conspiracy. Because she was thought to be “safe”,she witnessed many conversations about the New World Order which support thethemes that I and scores of others have written about, including the plans for amilitary coup on the United States.43 As Cathy’s experiences confirm, theattempt to complete the takeover of the world is not a theory it is REAL. It’shappening now. She says she heard both Reagan and Bush insist that the only wayto “world peace” is the “mind control of the masses”. She was able to observethe planning of the New World Order project, Education 2000, while under thecontrol of another of her and Kelly’s programmers and sexual abusers, BillBennett, a Jesuit-trained42 Trance-Formation Of America, p223.43 For more on this see .. and the truth shall set you free mdThe Robots’Rebellion.Picture #81 [images/img_0081.png]68mind-controller, who became US Education Secretary under ReaganBush.44 Analleged paedophile is named Education Secretary of the United States? Give mestrength. Ele was eventually replaced as Education Secretary by his associate,Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, with whom Cathy says she hadbeen forced to take part in a Satanic ritual in an affluent area of Nashville.45Bill Bennett’s brother, Bob, who is also alleged to have raped Kelly at theBohemian Grove in 1986, later became “legal counsel” to Bill Clinton.46 Anotherof Bill Bennett’s roles was to head a “war of drugs” for George Bush! Well atleast Bennett could not be accused of a lack of experience in the subject. Cathywas used to compromise and provide “favours” for key politicians to ensuresupport for Education 2000. She learned that this project, also known as America2000 and Global 2000, is designed to increase children’s “learning” capacitywhile destroying their ability to critically think for themselves.47 Yes,mothers and fathers, our children are being mind-controlled every day at schooland most of the teachers don’t even know they are doing it! A friend who worksin education research in the United Kingdom has had access to suppressed surveyswhich show that children are asking fewer and fewer questions about the “facts”they are told at school particularly after they move to the senior schools.Cathy witnessed how the United Nations is just a vehicle for the Global Elite ofthe All Seeing Eye. George Bush referred to the New World Order as his“Neighbourhood” and talked of how he simply told many other world “leaders”,like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, what to do and say. No doubt the same applies toSaddam Hussein. The US Ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, is knowinglypart of the New World Order conspiracy and George Bush once described her inCathy’s presence as the reverend mother of all sisters (slaves).”48Albright knows about the US Government’s mind-controlled slaves and supportsthat policy. Yet there she is in front of the television cameras at the UnitedNations lecturing other countries on “human rights.” Brian Mulroney, theCanadian Prime Minister and child rapist, talked about the plan for the NewWorld Order while with Cathy and Reagan at the same White House cocktail partyat which she met Albright. Cathy says44 Trance-Formation Of America, pl79.45 Ibid pi 72.46 Ibid.47 Ibid pi 75.48 Ibid pi 76.Picture #82 [images/img_0082.png]69she was subsequently taken to a White House bedroom with other slaves, includingone controlled by the US Senator, Arlen Spector. Mulroney then arrived to rapethem after activating their sex slave programming.49 Cathy noticed that one ofthe slaves had a red rose tattooed on her left wrist and other people she metover the years, including Mulroney, wore the symbol of the red rose. This is thesign of the New World Order cult known as the Order of the Rose, possiblyinspired by the Elite-controlled secret society called the Rosecrucians, and itis part of the All Seeing Eye Cult. Other people connected to the Order of theRose include Clinton, Bush, Byrd, Bennett, and Trudeau. How fascinating, then,that the United Kingdom Labour Party should change it’s party symbol in the1980s to... the red rose. Isn’t life just full of amazing coincidences?Another vital area which Cathy O’Brien’s experiences highlight is that of the“alien” threat. Some of her mind compartments were programmed with “alien”themes and many of her abusers, including Bush, claimed to be “aliens” from “farof{ deep space” who had taken over the planet. Cathy believes that holographicprojections were used to give the appearance to her of people transforming into“lizard-like” aliens. This relates to the theme in some UFO and extraterrestrialresearch of a race known as “Reptilians” operating on the planet. What if it wasnot a hologram that Cathy saw? What if these reptile-like extraterrestrials canmanifest in human form? I know it sounds fantastic, but with each month thatpasses I am more convinced by the weight of evidence that this is the case. Iwill expand on this in my next book.However, I emphasise again that we need to treat claims about the threat of an“alien” invasion of this planet with enormous care. If you have “flying saucer”- type technology developed in the secret underground bases and you have theability to project highly detailed holographic images, you can easily dupepeople who do not know what is happening into believing they are witnessing suchan invasion or a “sign” in the sky from “God”, whichever God you may choose tofollow. That doesn’t mean that what appears to be happening is actuallyhappening. The extraterrestrials known as Reptilians and their offshoots do notneed to invade the planet. They are already here!The events described by Cathy are not limited to the United States. The Cult ofthe All Seeing Eye is a global operation and so its Satanic, black magic,rituals are going on all over the world. Shortly after I came49 Trance-Formation Of America, p!77.Picture #83 [images/img_0083.png]70across the Cathy O'Brien material, I met another immensely brave woman, now aged40, in England. I will leave her unnamed at this time. The stories she told meabout her experiences mirrored so many of those described by Cathy O'Brien. Soonafter she was bom in Darlington in the 1 930s, she was sold by her father to twoSatanists. She knew them only as Thomas and Helena. She was “brought up” in themost horrific circumstances at a children’s home in Hull, which was ran by twoother child abusers. At night a torch light would be shone into their bedroomsand if it was held on you for a minute for so, you knew it was your turn to godownstairs and be sexually abused. People think this sort of thing is rare. Likehell it is. It’s rampant. The Satanic ritual network connects into thechildren’s home, runaways’ hostel, network to ensure a constant supply ofchildren. Please tell me what you know.Ted Gunderson, a man of 28 years experience with the FBI, told a mind-controlconference in the United States that after long and detailed research, heestimates there are 3.75 million practicing Satanists in the US and between 50and 60,000 human sacrifices a year. Therapists at the conference said that theirclients had pointed to a mass Satanic grave site in open land outside Lancaster,California.50 Another exists, apparently, at Matamoros, Mexico.During holidays back in Darlington, from the age of just seven and eight, myEnglish informant met her father, who connected her with the two Satanists,Thomas and Helena. She would be given drags via orange juice and ice cream andtaken at night in a van to country churches in the Darlington area. The dragswere designed to make her easier to mind-control and compartmentalise to preventher from remembering what she saw. However, as is often the case when peopleenter their 30s and 40s, the compartments gradually break down and their mindsstart to relive flashbacks of their ordeals. They experience them again likewatching a movie screen. It is for this reason that so many are murdered beforethey reach that age. Others are subjected to the “snatchback” when they areabducted to undergo “booster” mind programming to keep the compartments in placeand the memories secret. Increasing numbers of people who survived theirhorrendous young lives are now beginning to remember and they are telling thesame basic tale. If you are one of them, please contact me.In the ordeals at the country churches which she now remembers, she and otherchildren would be used in Satanic rituals involving sex,50 Contact newspaper, April 4th 1995, p23.Picture #84 [images/img_0084.png]71torture and murder. The windows of the church were covered over with blackdrapes and the inside was laid out according to Satanic law with differentcolours used for different ceremonies, depending on the time of year. Sometimesthey would use the churches in secret, but don’t underestimate how many peoplein the “Christian” clergy are also members of the Satanic network. TheSatanists, she remembers, were dressed in robes and a number wore masks,including the face of a goat. In the UK, as in America, some of the best knownnames in the country are involved. She remembers vividly (God, the thought ofit) being laid on her back on the floor of a church as a screaming boy, no morethan six, was being held by the hair above her while a man who would laterbecome a top politician in Northern Ireland had anal sex with him. When it wasover, a knife was produced to cut the boy’s throat and the blood poured overher. “I remember this man’s eyes” she told me “The coldness of his eyes I willnever forget”. He prefers boys to girls, she said. Why am I thinking of theKincora Boys Home in Belfast as I write this? On more than one occasion, shesays, she was brutally raped by another man who has been a big name in UnitedKingdom politics for decades. This man, she says, used to hold her naked body tohim by using hooks inserted into her flesh at the hips. She was just a littlegirl when this was happening. I know this is hard to read and I was numb fordays when I heard all this, but it’s time to be adult and know what is reallygoing on in the world, because if we don’t this will continue.Within days of speaking to me, the woman was grabbed off the street and bungledinto a van by six Satanists. A syringe was held to her throat as she was warnedto stop talking to that “dangerous prat” Icke and to stop naming names. Theythreatened her life and those of her children if she continued. She was alsotold that if she didn’t keep quiet, the family dog would be taken and “postedback to you in pieces”. Nice people. These Satanists had better understand thefollowing: I know the names of the two famous politicians and I have the woman’stestimony on tape. Copies of this are in the possession of many different peopleand if anyone even breathes heavily on her, myself, or any person connected withus, those tapes will be sent to scores of different people in the media andelsewhere immediately, and I will name them publicly myself. I am waiting for afew more confirmations from others abused by these men and, if I get them, Iwill name the names anyway. If you know anything, contact me.What this woman and others have told me would defy belief if it were not comingfrom so many different, unconnected, sources and were notPicture #85 [images/img_0085.png]72the stories across the world telling the same basic tale, even down to thedetail of the rituals and mind programming techniques. The children and thetraumatised adults they become have nowhere to turn. Their stories are sofantastic that few believe them and they are frightened of going to the policebecause they know that the Satanic network includes top police officers, judges,civil servants, media people, politicians, and many others who control our“free” society. Questions like “Who are you going to tell” and “Where are yougoing to run are used to break the spirit of people. Their sense of hopelessnessmakes them think there is nothing they can do to seek justice, so they give upand stop trying. Also, as so many of them have said, they are dragged andprogrammed to take part themselves in the ritual murder and torture of otherchildren. This is videoed and played to them when they are back in a consciousstate. They are so horrified at what they have done and so terrified of theconsequences that they dare not speak to the authorities. The stories of thepeople five talked to and the accounts of others I have read tell of events thatare beyond comprehension, or, at least, they would be if they were not actuallyhappening. Drinking blood, eating the flesh of dead bodies, thousands of adultsand children buried in deep graves, the murder of people on camera for the socalled “snuff’ videos, the story is just appalling. One mother told a televisiondocumentary in the Dispatches series on Channel Four in Britain of how she wasforced to place her new bom baby on a Satanic altar and push a knife through itsheart. A Satanist then had sex with the baby’s dead body. This is happening inyour country now!The Cult of the All Seeing Eye can continue with its global dictatorship in allits grotesque forms because most people can’t be bothered about what is going onin the world and who is controlling their lives and those of their children.They are so pressured by debt and fear that they keep their heads down and theireyes closed; or they are more concerned about the price of beer, the latest“scandal” on the television soaps, or how their soccer team is doing. MichaelAquino, the All Seeing Eye representative at the heart of the US Government’spsychological warfare against its own population, once told Cathy O’Brien: “95%of the people want to be led by the other 5% and the 95% do not want to knowwhat is really going on in government”. How sad that this is actually true.Anyone who still believes that the outcome of soccer matches or the price ofbeer is really important in the wider picture of life on this planet mightbenefit from reading the following.Picture #86 [images/img_0086.png]73It is an account in Cathy’s own words of what happened to her child, Kelly,again and again:“Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s“Neighborhood ” and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter. Sheran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilising headaches for anaverage of three days (as is consistent with high voltage trauma). These werethe only tell-tale evidences aside from the scarring burns left on her skin.Houston forbade me to call a doctor and Kelly forbade me to comfort herpitifully complaining that her head “hurt too bad even to move. ” And she didnot move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain, and herrectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My ownmind-control victimisation rendered me unable to help or protect her. Seeing mychild in such horrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in deeperperpetuating my total inability to affect her needs until our rescue by MarkPhillips in 1988.“Kelly’s bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators of GeorgeBush’s paedophile perversions. 1 have overheard him speak blatantly of hissexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to‘pull my strings' and control me. The psychological ramifications of being rapedby a paedophile president are mind-shattering enough, but reportedly Bushfurther reinforced his traumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASAelectronic and drug mind-control devices. Bush also instilled the ‘Whova gonnacall? ’ and ‘1 'll be watching you ’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing hersense of helplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a childnow seem trite in comparison to the brutal physical and psychologicaldevastation that George Bush inflicted on my daughter”51While I was reading that and putting together the other information in thischapter, do you know what was happening in the United Kingdom? The collectivepsyche of England was mesmerised by a soccer match in the European footballchampionship known as Euro ’96. The newspapers, radio, and television, wereablaze with stories about the England football team. The tabloid papers,particularly the Daily Mirror, were full of pathetic pictures of Englishplayers, including some wearing tin helmets as the Mirror declared “footballwar” on Germany.41 Trance-Formation Of America, p!58.Picture #87 [images/img_0087.png]74Meanwhile, these “journalists” were allowing all that I have described and somuch more to continue uninvestigated, unexposed. England lost to Germany in thatmatch (good) and it was seen as a time for national mourning. Some people criedbecause eleven Englishmen in grey shirts had failed to kick a ball into a netmore times than eleven Germans in white shirts. Still others went on the rampagein towns and cities. One Russian man was stabbed because he “sounded” like aGerman. And a few people can’t control the world and keep all this stuff quiet?It’s a doddle. I am not knocking football. Played well it is a beautiful game,but it’s just that - a game. It isn’t important. If it’s not soccer, it’s soapson the television, lotteries, and game shows which focus the collective psycheon total crap and therefore divert our minds from what the tiny few are doing tous and our world. Also at the time I was compiling this chapter, I wasapproached in the street by two Mormon “missionaries” seeking to convert me totheir “faith”. These two young clones of the mind manipulators of Salt Lake Cityhad no idea of the horrors being perpetrated in that place, nor that the truecontrollers of their “church” are the Satanists and child abusers of the UnitedStates Government. The human race has allowed itself to become little more thana mushroom which is constantly kept in the dark and fed bullshit.Cathy O’Brien and my contact in England both agree that despite all the horrorsand mind-control they suffered, their core spirituality could not be broken.That spiritual core is the unbreakable spark of light within us. It is theSource Consciousness. Pure love. That is far more powerful than any scale ofnegativity. It is the spark which will lead us out of here if only we will setit free.What are the emotions within you now as you read of those names and the actionsI’ve described? For most, I have no doubt, it will be a combination of hatred,anger and fear. All of them understandable. But what emotions also consume thepeople who do these things and those who control the Cult of the All Seeing Eye?Hatred, anger, and fear. We surely don’t need any more of that. Those who havesuffered and continue to suffer from these people, or rather the consciousnessthat possesses them, clearly need our love in enormous abundance. But so, too,do those responsible. It is the absence of love in their hearts that allows themto do it. Of course, what they do must be exposed and they must take the karmicconsequences of their actions. We’re all subject to that and the time for themto face their actions is here. But please, send them love, not hatred. They arepossessed people. Forgive them, they know not what they do.Picture #88 [images/img_0088.png]75To simply hurl abuse and hatred at those involved would be an easy way to passour responsibility for all this to someone else, to externalise thatresponsibility instead of looking at ourselves. It is no good anyone abdicatingtheir responsibility for what has happened to Cathy O’Brien and is stillhappening to her daughter, Kelly, and millions of others all over this planet.People like Bush, Clinton, Reagan, Ford, Trudeau, Mulroney, and Cheney may beamong the physical perpetrators of these horrors, but they can only go oncontrolling this world and treating our fellow men, women, and children, in thisastonishing manner because humanity has given its mind away and allowed the fewto ran the show. YOU are responsible, also, and so is everyone, particularlythose who have handed over their own infinite power to such an extent that theyhave become two-legged sheep in the bewildered herd. If humanity will learn thelessons of all this and take their power back, then the people I name in mybooks will, in terms of collective human evolution, have done everyone a favourby showing so, so clearly, what happens when you concede your right to be you.You control your reality; we all do, and collectively we have created the globalreality exposed here. We can create a new reality. It’s just a thought, achoice, a change of attitude away. There is not a moment to lose. The time tomake that choice is.. NOW We, and only we, hold the key which, with one turn,one change of perception, can transform this world from a prison to a paradise.Picture #89 [images/img_0089.png]76Chapter 5Here’s Looking At You, KidHow are you feeling after reading all that? I'm not surprised. I thought I'dnever be shocked again, but nothing prepares you for the scale of blacknesswhich currently controls Planet Earth. Such control, however, is only possiblebecause we have conceded our inner power. Indescribable as those events may be,the people involved are telling us something about ourselves. Nothing happens inisolation. Everything has a consequence. When you give your mind andresponsibility away, you allow the few to control the mass. Given the staggeringextremes described in the last chapter, you can appreciate the scale to whichthe human race has handed its infinite power to this Global Elite. The Elite, infact, is a mirror of us and our inner state of being. The information presentedin the rest of this book is fundamental to the dismantling of the global pyramidand the unimaginable suffering it constantly manifests.The definition of the word Mirror: polished surface; reflecting image; thatwhich gives faithful reflection. So says the Oxford Concise Dictionary. Liftyour eyes from this page. Look around you. Look at your life, your family, yourjob, your friends and surroundings. You are looking at a mirror. A mirror ofyou.If you don’t like your life, then change it. You’re in control. You have createdthe life you don’t like, so now create one that you do. Crazy? Too simple? Notat all. You are in control of your destiny and so is everyone. We have just beenconditioned to believe that someone else is in control, so we create thatreality. If we can be duped into believing that we are powerless to control ourlives, we look to others for guidance and answers instead of trusting ourselves.People hand their power to priests, gurus, politicians, economists, and scoresof others. Tell me what to think, Mr Pope, Mr Rabbi, Mr New Age “teacher”.Hey, YOU are in control of you. YOU know what is best for you. Nobody else. Youdon’t need anyone to tell you what to do and think.Picture #90 [images/img_0090.png]77How dare anyone tell you how to live your life? And what are you doing allowingit to happen? You can take your power back. It is infinite.Every second of every day in every breath of your life, you are creating yourown reality. Our lives reflect precisely our imagination of ourselves. If wethink we are a “common man and woman” and that the good things and greatachievements happen only to others, that is the way it will be. Our lives willreflect that imagination and perception of ourselves. If we desire to give ourpower away to others, to hand over our responsibility for the world and our owndestiny; then our lives, and the world, will reflect that imagination andperception. Those thoughts will manifest themselves physically as a Global Eliterunning the show. And they have. What we call the world is a second-by-secondphysical replica of human thought, the human imagination, or lack of it. We arewhat we think and feel. Bill Hicks, the American comedian, was very funny andvery perceptive. He was making powerful statements about life and the way we arecontrolled before he died in 1994 at the age of only 33. He described life inthis way:“It’s like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go on it you thinkit’s real because that’s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down,round and round, it has thrills and chills, and it’s very brightly coloured andvery loud. And it’s fun for a while. Some have been on the ride for a long timeand they begin to question: Is this real or is this just a ride? And otherpeople have remembered and they come back to us and they say: Hey, don't worry,don’t be afraid, ever because this is just a ride.“And we kill those people.“Shut him up! We’ve got a lot invested in this ride. Shut him up! Look at myfurrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to bereal.“It’s just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try to tell us that.Have you ever noticed that? And we let the demons run amok. But it doesn ’tmatter because it’s just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It’s justa choice. No effort, no job ’ no savings of money. A choice right now betweenfear and love. ”Picture #91 [images/img_0091.png]78The difference between fear and love is the difference between a prison and aparadise. Both are the physical reflections of thoughts. Our thoughts.The suppression of knowledge over these centuries of psychological fascism (alsoknown as religion, education, “science” and the media) has sought to deny usinformation that would open our eyes and our minds to who we really are.Knowledge about our own identity has been systematically kept from us. This hasbeen done because within this knowledge lies the understanding that would set usfree. Religion, and more latterly “science”, have been the major players in thissuppression. For a long time, and still today in many parts of the world, toreject what religions demand we believe has been a death sentence. More widelytoday, to reject that which society and “science” demands we believe is toattract ridicule and condemnation. Merely to investigate beliefs outside themainstream Flassle-Free Zone is often to be dubbed strange, mad or dangerous.Yet it is those beliefs that have stood the passage of time, not thoseindoctrinated into us these past few thousand, and in the case of “science” thelast few hundred, years. As ever mounting evidence has forced “science” to openits eyes, oh so slowly, to the desperate limitations of its childlike beliefsystem, so the evidence gathers by the day that the so called “alternative”beliefs have held in their core an eternal truth that has survived the darkyears of inquisition and suppression. It is time for that knowledge to step outof the shadows and be open for all to see. Through the ages it has been usedsecretly by the manipulating few the cult of the All Seeing Eye, to imprisonhumanity. Now it can be used with love to set us free.The manufactured, manipulated, versions of life called religion and “science”,may seem to be in opposition. But again, on closer reflection, they areoppo-sames. Both survive only by the suppression of knowledge and both havefostered a fear, even terror, of death. On the one side we are told of some Godwho will judge us after our one life on Earth, a life that will last anythingfrom a few seconds to a hundred years or more. As a result of this one life inwhich we are all bom into vastly different circumstances, this loving, judging,often merciless and vindictive God, will decide if it is heaven or hell foreverand a day. Apparently, unless we believe that His son, Jesus Christ, is oursaviour. I’m afraid we are doomed to stoke the fires for you-know-who. Of coursewe could always make sure of our place upstairs if we allowed the priests totell us what to say, think, and do, because as His representatives on Earth,they know what He wants. Fine, I don’t havePicture #92 [images/img_0092.png]79to think for myself then? Phew, that’s a relief. Thank you vicar. And what if Imake big donations to the church while poverty abounds around me or I go off andkill a few thousand people who refuse to believe what I am told to believe? Ohmy son, the Lord shall look upon you with gratitude (He says the cheque shouldbe made out to me, by the way). You see how simple life is when you don’t haveto think? This mentality has dominated human evolution into the modem world and,amazing as it is to me, it still controls the minds of countless millions as weenter the 21 st century. Because people are not keen on being judged by “God”(what if I don’t pass?) they put off that dreadful day for as long as they can.Thus, anything that might possibly bring that day forward is immediately avoidedand the fear of death becomes a wonderful means of keeping people quiet andunder the iron fist. Nothing has been more successful in controlling the humanmind than religion and that control has depended for its survival on thesuppression of knowledge, not least the knowledge that life is forever, foreveryone, and that we are not apart from God, we are God. Oops, I’ve blasphemed.Slap my wrist. Throw us that shovel, this fire needs a stoke.The word science comes from a word meaning knowledge which is why I always writeit as “science”. For mainstream “science” is not the pursuit of knowledgeoverwhelmingly, it is about defending a rigid belief system and repelling allinformation that would demolish the foundations of those rigid beliefs. In thatsense, “science” and religion are at one. This form of “science” is just anotherreligion with the priests in white coats instead of long gowns. “Scientists”have become the new priesthood. “Science” is stuck in the five senses of touch,smell, hearing, taste and sight. If something can’t be measured by one of thoseit cannot possibly exist. Really? What about thought? Thought cannot be touched,smelled, heard, tasted or seen, except as its physical expression. Does thatmean thought does not exist? Of course it exists. Or at least I think it does!So what is thought? According to mainstream “science”, thought is a physicalbrain function. But what about near death experiences when the person isphysically dead for a short time? Tens of millions have experienced theirconsciousness leaving their body and observing their own physical form from someother dimension or state of being. Often they describe what the doctors andnurses were doing while they were “dead”. What about those who recall under deephypnosis the fine details, checkable and provable, of previous lives on theEarth? They were then in a different body with aPicture #93 [images/img_0093.png]80different brain, so how can their thoughts and memories be a function of thebrain they have now? Instead of looking at the endless evidence of people’sexperiences and evolving scientific understanding in the light of that, themainstream “scientists” seek to discredit and dismiss the experiences ofmultimillions all over the world to preserve the “scientific” status quo: Whatpeople have experienced could not happen unless our view of physics is wrong”comes the “scientific” response “and as our physics cannot possibly be wrong,those people must have been mistaken”. Oh, good. Thank you very much, Mr“Expert”, we can all go back to sleep now. And there was me thinking that the“scientists” didn’t know it all.As the foundations of scientific certainties see their credibility crumble underthe avalanche of information now emerging, their explanations of “unexplainable”phenomena become more and more silly and hysterical. In Britain we have auniversity lecturer who is wheeled out onto virtually every television and radioprogramme about these subjects. Her role is to debunk alternative informationwith often ridiculous “explanations” and to defend the “scientific” status quountil her knuckles turn white. I wonder what it is within the psyche of those inthe “scientific” establishment which makes them so desperate to persuade peoplethat only oblivion awaits us at the end of our physical life. When the braindies, we cease to exist, they cry. They have every right to believe that if theywish. The reason I challenge the “science” establishment is not for what theybelieve, but for the way they indoctrinate others into believing the same andsuppress the alternative explanations.The fear of oblivion fostered by “science” is also a big incentive to put offthe moment of death as long as possible, so people keep their heads down andtheir mouths shut in case they bring forward that terrible day when the lightsgo out forever. The cosmic accident-life’s-abitch-and-then-oblivion scenario isalso a massive blow to human self worth. What’s the point in life, it’s all someaningless isn’t it? There is one other vital connection between the views ofmost religion and mainstream “science”. They both believe our lives and ourdestiny are in the hands of others. Religion says God is in control of our lifeand that He is constantly judging our every thought and action. My goodness oldGod must have a big note book. And all those pens. “Science” says that randomaccidents are in control of our life and only the strongest and fittest survivethe journey. I’d better trample on everyone in my way, then. It’s no good beingsoft - get out of my way.Picture #94 [images/img_0094.png]81It’s the law of nature, you know. “Scientists” have proved it. Yes, my friends,take your pick. Is God in control of your life or a series of random accidents?Neither. YOU are.Persuading us that we are not in control and cannot be in control is the perfectway to prevent us from taking control - the last thing you want to happen ifyour aim is to create a human herd, all desperate for others to tell them whereto go, what to do, and what to think. What better means can there be to preventus from expressing our true power than to kid us that we have no power toexpress? Which is why the knowledge I am about to outline is so dangerous tothose few who control the world. People celebrating their uniqueness andcontrolling their own lives will bring the Larry Grayson pyramid and its GlobalElite crashing to the ground. Game over.Open-minded real science is now beginning to support the beliefs of the ancientcultures and civilisations that have long gone. Ancient Greece, Egypt, Sumer,Babylon, Central and South America, Asia, China, and thousands of other culturesacross the world were based on this knowledge. So were, and are, the beliefs ofthe native peoples like the Aborigines and the Native Americans. Ironically,Christianity, which has so condemned these cultures, was founded on the sameknowledge and its ceremonies derive from the so called “Pagan” ceremonies whichChristians dismiss as “evil”. You’ve got to chueme really. These beliefs, oftenpassed on in legend, myth, and symbolism to avoid the religious hit squads, saythat the mind and the body are not the same thing. The body is an expression ofour consciousness during a physical life and so the body, too, reflects ourstate of mind. Disharmony in the consciousness reflects itself as disharmony(dis-ease) in the body. We become ill. In the same way we can think ourselvesback to health by finding harmony within our consciousness. But the body is notthe “real” self, it is the temporary physical shell for the real self. I callthe body a genetic spacesuit, the physical vehicle through which the eternalpart of us - the soul - can experience this dense physical world. Ourconsciousness is eternal while the body has a finite life and returns to thesoil and the energy pool when we “die”. But we don’t “die”. Our consciousness,the thinking, feeling, emotional us, withdraws from the spacesuit and moves onto another world, another time-space reality or frequency. This is happeningduring the near-death experience. It’sPicture #95 [images/img_0095.png]82interesting that when we talk of God or heaven, most people still look up to thesky. It is a reflex response to the religious belief that God and heaven aresomehow “up there”. If you look at the enormous evidence that extraterrestriallife has played a major role in human evolution and how they landed hereregularly in ancient times, I believe that we still look up for God and heavenbecause the “gods” of the ancient texts, including the Old Testament, wereextraterrestrials in their anti-gravity (flying saucer) craft. The “gods”literally came from the sky. The word from which the biblical “Lord” wastranslated really means Lords, the plural. It is the same with the biblical“God”. It was translated from a word meaning “gods.” Read the Old Testament andreplace every Lord and God with the word extraterrestrials and what appears tobe biblical nonsense starts to make some kind of sense. You will find much moreabout this in ... and the truth shall set you free and The Robots’ Rebellion. Bythe way, those who dismiss the idea of extraterrestrial life might remember thatthere are estimated to be four billion stars in this galaxy and four billiongalaxies in this universe. And we are alone? Sure we are.This diversion of God being “up there” and somehow physical in nature has led tothe idea that creation is a spiritual chest of drawers or high-rise office blockwith heaven at the top and hell at the bottom. This has obscured theunderstanding that heaven, hell and God are everywhere. Heaven and hell arestates of mind which we can experience anytime. We can have hell on Earth orheaven on Earth. It is our choice, our state of mind, which decides that. God isliterally everywhere because “God” is a gigantic energy field/consciousnesswhich is everything. It is your body, your mind, the grass, the trees, the sky,the rain. Everything. If it exists, it is an expression of the same ocean ofenergy/consciousness that we call God and Creation. Just as water, clouds, andice (liquid, gas, solid) are the same substance in different states of being, soeverything in Creation is the same energy/ consciousness in different states ofbeing. We are like droplets of consciousness in this ocean of consciousness. Weare individual, yes, in that we are the sum total of all our experiences andthey will be different from all the other droplets. But together with theenergy/ consciousness of the animals, insects, trees, flowers,extraterrestrials, everything, we form the ocean called “God”. It is the sameprinciple as individual droplets of water joining together to form the sea. Thewaves that break on the shores of Australia are part of the same mass of waterwhich crashes against the harbour walls of Ireland or New York, hi thePicture #96 [images/img_0096.png]83same way, the animals are not apart from you. They are you. So are the trees,the grass, the water. Everything is you and you are everything. If you hurtanother expression of God, you are only hurting yourself, another aspect ofyourself.Far from being “up there”, the infinite consciousness we call God is everythingand everywhere. It is you and everything around you, including all the other“worlds” that we cannot see. The energy field/ consciousness we call God is nota chest of drawers. It consists of endless time-space realities (worlds) allsharing the same space and interpenetrating each other. There are differentfrequencies or dimensions, just as the frequencies of radio and televisionstations share the same space that your body is occupying now. To access one ofthose stations, all you do is tune your television or radio to a particularfrequency and bingo there it is. Move the dial and one station “disappears” andyou tune to another. When you move the dial from a particular station, thatstation doesn’t cease to exist, it goes on broadcasting, even though you are nolonger tuned to it and you are not aware of what it is transmitting. So it iswith the infinite frequencies of Creation. At this moment, your consciousness istuned to this “station”, the one we call the dense physical universe. But allthe other frequencies of Creation continue to exist in the same space we areoccupying, even though we are not aware of them. The physical body and brainscreen out of our perception far, far more than we actually feel and see. Thewhole of Creation exists within the same “empty” space that you are occupyingnow - “The kingdom of heaven is within you”. But all except a fraction of thatinfinity operates outside of the frequency range of our physical senses.Therefore we don’t see it or hear it, although you can tune to some of these“hidden” levels by using your psychic senses which operate on a much higherfrequency range than the physical body. The space around and within you now,which appears to be “empty” to your physical senses, is in fact ablaze withelectrical and magnetic energy operating on an infinite number of wavelengthsand states of being. When we “die”, our consciousness leaves the physical bodyand this dense physical wavelength, and tunes to another “station” to continueour eternal evolution elsewhere. During sleep our consciousness journeys throughsome of these other wavelengths, hence we have “strange” dreams. It is sosimple.Energy and consciousness are the same, which is why all things are alive andhave an awareness, the ability to hold information. Everything has its ownpersonal vibratory “fingerprint”. When a psychic holds aPicture #97 [images/img_0097.png]84stone or an old ring or object, they can tune their consciousness to its energyfield and “read” the information it has absorbed. This could relate to theperson who once owned the object or an event that happened near the object.Whatever the case, it will retain that knowledge within a magnetic field, justlike a magnetic computer disk. Rocks and stones hold information within theirmagnetic fields which goes back millions of years and changes now unfolding inthe Earth’s energy fields will release this information into the minds of thosewho are open to it. An aspect of this re-emerging knowledge will be amazingdiscoveries that demolish the official version of history and confirm, forexample, the existence of ancient civilisations like Atlantis. Obviously, someexpressions of the God consciousness/energy have evolved to a point where theirawareness and ability to retain and process information is much further alongthe road than others. But the principle is the same for all that exists.Magnetic energy absorbs information and everything is magnetic-electricalenergy, albeit often forms of magnetism not yet understood on this planet. Onephysical world expression of this energy is what we call electromagnetism. Sometrue scientists have suggested that water has a memory and they have performedexperiments to prove it. There is no mystery in this at all, much as mairistreamscience is aghast at the suggestion. Water exists, it is magneticenergy/consciousness, therefore it has a memory. Everything does. It is thismagnetism, a vibratory resonance and attraction, that allows us to create ourown reality in every moment of our lives. Like vibrations attract likevibrations and like energy fields attract like energy fields. What we think ofourselves is reflected in the experiences we attract. Til explain what I mean.When our eternal consciousness incarnates into a dense physical body, theconsciousness reflects the sum total of our experience going back to infinity.From the moment of birth we see the world differently to each other because oureternal journey has been different, although it may take two or three years forthis to become observable. Even from an early age, however, children manifestthese differences of perception. They become frightened by different things,even without direct experience of them in this life. They reveal differentpersonalities, likes and dislikes, and abilities. Some people say these traitsare created from the genes of their parents a view which reveals a desperationto see everything as physical. But take my experience as just one example. Icould not be more different from the rest of my family. For as long as I canremember I felt those differences. I was soon interested in sportPicture #98 [images/img_0098.png]85and became a professional soccer player. No-one in my family for as far back asanyone can trace has ever been interested in playing professional sport, noreven, most of them, playing or watching sport at all. My fascination with natureand the protection of the planet is not shared by anyone in my family. Myinterest in the spiritual and the research into who controls the world is uniqueto me in my family. The differences in attitude, belief, and view between myparents, brothers, and myself are vast and endless. I am me and they are thembecause we are the sum total of our eternal experiences, not because of somegenetic accident. I am not saying that genetic inheritance does not affect us,but it certainly does not determine our personalities and abilities.Contained within our subconscious self from the moment of birth are all thememories, knowledge, and experiences, that we have absorbed on our eternaljourney. The subconscious is also constantly adding to its memory bank with eachnew event we experience. The observations that result from experience passthrough the eyes, ears, and brain, and are added to the spiritual library ofknowledge and understanding that we call our evolution. It also adds to theevolution of creation as a whole. No experience is ever wasted. Also in thesubconscious library will be astrological influences that are unique to us.There is a great deal of nonsense talked about astrology, I feel, both by thosewho dismiss it as mumbojumbo and those who treat it like a cratch which guidestheir every decision. Astrological influences are an important contribution toour sense of self, but they are still only part of the picture, not the entirecanvas. Our consciousness is a series of vibrating energy fields operating in asea of electromagnetic energy. Other vibrations, like those broadcast by theplanets, affect these energy fields we call consciousness and can enhance orimbalance them. Here you have the answer to the “mystery” of why so many peopleliving close to electrical power lines suffer from rare illnesses. “Science”says there is no connection between power lines and illness because “science”has such an incredibly blinkered view of life and, no doubt, because to identifya link would prove very costly to the power companies. Such unusual illness iscaused by the electromagnetic fields projected from the power lines. Thiselectromagnetism destabilises the magnetic fields of the human body and theconsciousness. In turn, this vibrational disharmony is reflected as physicaldisharmony disease. I am convinced that the rise in cancer and the correspondingrise in electromagnetic technology in our homes, work places, and cities, arefundamentally connected.Picture #99 [images/img_0099.png]86This basic process of vibrational interaction between electromagnetic energyfields is similar in astrology. When we are bom, we absorb a unique energypattern for that particular physical life. The nature of this energy pattern isdecided by when and where we are bom1 - the information an astrologer alwayswants to know before a reading. Planets, as with everything that exists, arevibrating magnetic energy fields. Extremely powerful ones, too, of course. Asthey orbit the Sun, their relationship to the Earth and the power of theirenergy fields to effect the Earth, constantly changes. Sometimes theelectromagnetic vibrations of one planet, or combination of planets, will bemost powerfully affecting the Earth, while on other occasions it will be otherplanets or combinations of them. So someone bom in Leicester, England, at 6.15pm on April 29th 1952 will absorb a different electromagnetic energy field froma person bom in Los Angeles, California, at 10.15 am on October 9th 1985.Because of this, the way people react to the vibrations of the planets as theymove through the “heavens” will differ because our vibratory energy fields aredifferent. One person might be lifted by a particular astrological movementwhile another may feel depressed. These planetary energies also containknowledge and inspirations, and our consciousness aims to be bom in a place andat a time when we will absorb the planetary energy combination that will help usmost effectively to complete our plan of experience in this physical life.Research has shown how often people in particular jobs or with particularabilities are bom at the same time of year.So within our subconscious self is a cocktail of thought and perception thatincludes the knowledge and emotional debris of our eternal experiences or “pastlives”, the astrological pattern that we absorb at birth, and the experiences ofthis life. Together they produce our state of being, our sense of self, ourimagination of ourselves. It is our imagination of ourselves that creates ourphysical reality. Everything is an electromagnetic, vibrating, unique, energyfield and all the time we are broadcasting our own unique magnetic energypattern. These are the “vibes” people speak of when they say that someone hasgood or bad “vibes”. The vibes we broadcast affect the energy field around us.When we talk of “atmosphere”, we are describing the energy field at a certainlocation, an energy field created by the thoughts, the vibes, of people.Battlefields can still remain1 Some researchers believe that the moment of conception decides the nature ofthe energy field, not birth.Picture #100 [images/img_0100.png]87“eerie” hundreds of years after the event because the vibrations created by thepain, aggression, and suffering of battle are still there until other thoughtpatterns replace them. We walk into a room where there has been a major argumentand we say “You can cut the atmosphere with a knife in there”. We go intoanother house where very positive events have happened and we talk of the“lovely atmosphere” or a “happy house”. Such examples are all the result of thevibrations, the thoughts, broadcast by people affecting the magnetic energyfield. These vibrations mirror exactly the person’s state of being at aparticular moment and, it is most important to remember, what we give out iswhat we get back. What we broadcast as a magnetic pattern returns to us as aphysical reality. As Bill Hicks said: “All matter is merely energy condensed toa slow vibration; we’re all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively;there’s no such thing as death; life is just a dream; and we are the imaginationof ourselves.” That’s the vital point: we are the imagination of ourselves.Our magnetic pattern reflects our inner sense of self. Our inner reality thenbecomes our physical reality because our magnetic pattern attracts towards usother magnetic thought fields - people, places, ways of life, experiences, whichmirror precisely the pattern we are broadcasting. This is why, for example,people are attracted to certain locations to make a home or have a holiday. Theattraction is not only visual, but vibrational. Magnetic. We feel drawn or“pulled” there. This is also how we set up our “coincidences” - the “fancyseeing you here” situations. These are not random accidents, but magnetic energyfields being drawn subconsciously together. It is not a “small world”, but theinteraction of magnetic fields can make it appear so! By this process ofvibrational magnetism, our subconscious mind creates an exact physical replicaof itself before our eyes in the people, places, ways of life, and experiences,that come our way. As I said at the start of this chapter, when you look throughyour eyes you are looking at a mirror of your inner self. Everything will bereflecting part of you, or your need to leam or experience something. Changeyour inner self and you change its physical replica - your life. The reality younow experience is the result of what you think of you. It is the imagination youhave of yourself within your conscious and subconscious mind. We create with ourthoughts and experience those creations through our emotions and feelings.Whatever you experience it is the result of what you are broadcasting because of(a) the thoughts and actions from the past or present which you need to face foryour evolution or (b) yourPicture #101 [images/img_0101.png]88astrological pattern (chosen by you before birth) which is attracting to youexperiences that are part of your life plan this time or (c) the experiences youneed to face to help you achieve what you have come to do in this lifetime onEarth.One extreme example of the latter, I believe, is Cathy O’Brien who, as a resultof suffering those appalling experiences as a mind-controlled slave, is now ableto expose what is happening. Without those experiences she could not have donethat. She is a magnificent servant to humanity. It’s important to appreciatethat our perception of life while outside the physical body is so different tothe perception we have while encased in this dense physical space suit.Therefore the decisions we make and the lives we choose before incarnation,often seem ridiculous to us when we are experiencing the physical consequencesof those decisions. This certainly applies to the parents we choose. There isnoone on another level forcing us to incarnate into those situations, so insteadof hurling the blame for an unpleasant childhood onto the parents, we might morepositively ask why we chose to experience that situation and what we were hopingto learn and achieve by it. This allows the destructive resentment to disperseand the constructive learning to emerge. That includes the children who sufferso dreadfully from the events in chapter four.Like I say, our perceptions when we choose a life are very different from thosewe have when we are actually experiencing it. It is easy to observe peoplecreating their own reality. I knew a woman who had no self worth at all. “I’museless” she would say “I am a useless mother, a useless wife, and I havenothing to contribute”. In the same breath she would complain that everyone wasputting her down! “My husband puts me down, my children put me down, myhusband’s parents put me down” she would say. In fact, the reason for thatexperience was that she was putting herself down. That sense of her own self wasbeing transmitted as a magnetic vibratory pattern and it was attracting otherpatterns - the people in that woman’s life who were mirroring back her own senseof reality, her own imagination of herself.We are doing this in every moment of every day. When I was a television reporterI visited a hostel for physically abused women and I was amazed to find thatmost had been with at least two violent partners and some had been through threeor four. Why did they keep going around with such characters?, I thought. Itmade no sense. But now it does. The common theme of those women was their lackof self worth, self love, and self respect, and that had clearly been theirreality wellPicture #102 [images/img_0102.png]89before they began to attract violent partners. At some deep level they feelthemselves to be so useless and inadequate that they deserve to be punished.When that vibe is broadcast it will attract that sense of reality in the form ofan energy field (man) who desires to punish another. The sense of reality istherefore physically fulfilled and until the woman’s sense of self changes shewill go on attracting partner after partner who will treat her in the way thatwill create the reality, the imagination, she has of herself. The violent man isanother expression of the lack of self worth and self love that has bred like acancer in the collective human mind. Violent people are those who hatethemselves and instead of looking inside to find the cause of that self dislike,they thrash out at someone else. Their victim is a convenient mirror. In fact,if we all had big mirrors around our necks the world would change in an hourbecause we would all see ourselves as other people see us. It is fascinating tosee how the way we react to others is merely an expression of what we think ofourselves and violent people are a perfect example of this. As I look back on myown life I see how my sense of self at certain times attracted an exact physicalreplica. As a child I was terrified of dogs and wherever I went I was pursuedand chased by them. This never happened to my friends who were not afraid. Ithought I was just unlucky. I wasn’t. I was creating it by attracting to me whatI feared. We need to do this to overcome our fears, otherwise our potential isseverely limited and, in the area related to the fear, our evolution comes to ahalt. I remember too, that when I began to love and respect myself for what Iam, I began to attract around me more and more people who love and respect mefor what I am and not for what they would like me to be. You don’t like yourfriends? Change yourself and your friends will either change in their attitudetowards you or they will move out of your life and others will emerge to reflectyour new sense of you. Everything that happens in your life you are creating. Somany people have told me stories of how they have walked into a book shop and abook has “miraculously” fallen from the self at their feet. It is not a miracle.They have done it themselves. Their subconscious has connected magnetically withthe magnetic energy field of the book and pulled it off the shelf. Thesubconscious considers the book helpful to the reawakening of its consciouslevel and so it drops the hint in a physical way. Whatever we need, we draw tous.We also create the reality we call illness. Every ailment, whether minor orlife-threatening, we trigger ourselves. We either choose beforePicture #103 [images/img_0103.png]90incarnation to experience it on the journey to greater understanding or oursubconscious sewer of past life and present life emotional garbage manifestsitself physically as a dis-ease. The nature of the physical illness is relatedto the mental and emotional state which is creating the illness. The body is aconstant barometer of our emotions. I can recommend an excellent book on thissubject called You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay (Hay House Inc, USA, andEden Grove Publications, London). We store emotions we don’t want to deal within our bodies. I remember in the 1970s and 80s whenever I was wound up (most ofthe time) I would feel a pain in my back about half way down my left lung. In1995 when I was going through an emotional trough I was having an aromatherapymassage by a close friend of mine. When she ran her hands over that spot, I feltthe pain again. She said she would symbolically push that emotion out of thebody and I could deal with it. As she did so, very painfully, I started to cry.I had no idea why I was crying and I still don’t. But afterwards I felt twostones lighter emotionally. Something, whatever it was, had been let go. Cryingis actually good for us, it releases pent up, suppressed, emotions. I have criedmore in the last year than I have in the previous 35! But we are told that “bigboys don’t cry” and so the big boys die of heart attacks which result from thestress of unreleased energies within them. No-one has an unlucky illness andthat includes me with my arthritis from an early age. We create it and so we canuncreate it. Our bodies are an expression of our minds, emotions, and spirit.You can see this clearly when you observe people who, sometimes with very littlepreparation, walk barefoot across hot coals without pain or even discomfort.Their minds have told their bodies that they won’t bum or feel pain and theirbodies do as they are told. The same principle is also apparent when a childfalls over, but recovers miraculously when mum or dad has “kissed it better”.The child thinks it is possible to kiss it better and so the pain goes. Yourmind is in control of your body at all times.It is important, however, to appreciate that we all create our own reality. Ihave observed people who accept the principle, but then seek to deny it whensomething they don’t like happens to them. Instead of looking positively at whatthey are meant to leam from that situation, they look for someone to blame. Itis the same when people follow their intuition and “go with the flow”, but thencondemn others for following theirs. You can’t have it both ways here. There isnot one law for one and another for the rest of humanity. There is one law forPicture #104 [images/img_0104.png]91all of us: we create our own reality and our physical experience. Look at allthe events in your life, those you like and those you don’t, and you will see ifyou are honest with yourself that you have created them by what you think ofyou. There’s no-one to blame or to hand responsibility over to for what happensin your life. You are responsible. You are in control and you can changewhatever you wish by changing your imagination of yourself. I came across aphrase which captures this concept brilliantly:If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you ‘ve alwaysgot.The word “karma” is for me, another way of saying we create our own reality.Karma is interpreted by many to mean that what we do to others will be done tous. I feel there’s more to it than that. If we act negatively towards someone,that action reflects our state of being at that moment and this will bebroadcast as a vibratory pattern. Should we not learn from seeing the effects ofour action, we will go on transmitting that same state of being. This willattract to us a like vibration, someone who will do to us what we have done toanother: a mirror of our own sense of self which can also be described as ourkarma. If, however, we learn from seeing the effects of our actions, our senseof self changes and so does our pattern. We have learned from the experience(the reason for “karma”) and there is no need for us to attract some gratuitouspunishment when the learning has already been achieved. As our pattern has beenchanged by the experience we will not attract to us the karma, someone who willdo to us what we have done to another. When our sense of self changes, so doesour pattern, and so does the physical experience it attracts. The way the Hindureligion has used the idea of karma to justify a rigid hierarchy or castesystem, is an abuse of the word spiritual. You name it and someone somewherewill try to use it as a means of control. Karma is no different in that.Everything, but everything, in our lives comes back to the same point. Our livesare the imagination of ourselves. This applies even to children. We see childrenas physical bodies and that, understandably, affects the way we perceive them.In fact, a child is a multidimensional, eternal consciousness that could quiteeasily be further along the road of evolution than his or her parents. The sumtotal of the experiences and astrological influences within that child’sconsciousness will alsoPicture #105 [images/img_0105.png]92be creating his or her physical reality from the moment of birth. Thedifference, I feel, is that a child is operating on a more limited level ofconsciousness until the body has grown to match the potential of the mind.Imagine having access to the full range of your consciousness and knowledgewhile trapped in a child’s body. The frustration would be fantastic. But thesame principles that apply to adults also apply to children and all otherexpressions of God throughout creation. We choose when, where and with whom weincarnate, and we create our own reality. The loss and suppression of thisunderstanding is the very foundation of the ills that have been visited on theEarth for so long. This knowledge reveals that we are in control of our owndestiny while the versions of “life” that are indoctrinated into us by religionand science” insist that another force is in control, either a judgmental God orrandom accident. You can see why this suppressed knowledge is considered sodangerous by those who wish to control us and why it has been ridiculed orcondemned throughout known “history” as either “mad” or the work of the “Devil”.It is the knowledge that will set us free from the prisons of our own making.I saw a badge made in America which said: “The Tmth will set you free., .butfirst it will piss you off’. Very true. When you first realise how the humanrace has been so massively duped, it is not nice to hear. Nor, for many, is it awelcome thought that everything that happens in our lives is down to ourselves.What? I can’t blame anyone else? Eeeek! But I’m a victim of circumstance... I’munlucky.. .1 had a bad childhood... I’m always ill... I was deprived...abused... misled...Er, sorry. There’s no escape. Stop pointing the finger and get this:Your life, all of it, has been down to.. YOU.Why do some people think that news is so terrible? I’m ecstatic. If my life sofar has been all down to me, the rest of my eternal existence will be in my owncontrol, also. Yippeeeeeeee! No-one controls me. I’m not a victim, I’m me. I’mme in control of me. Zipper-dee-do-dahzipper-dee-ay! Mine’s a double, easy onthe ice. The trick is to seize that control and live it instead of looking forcountless ways to deny our own responsibility. To do that we need to detoxifyourselves from our emotional addictions. Emotions like fear, guilt, resentment,anger, worry, depression and so on, are every bit as addictive as drugs andbooze. People who are addicted to worry, for instance, are always searching forsomething to worry about because their system hasPicture #106 [images/img_0106.png]93become so dependent on feeling that energy that it needs its constant “fix”. Mymother used to say about some people: “It’s being so miserable that keeps themgoing”. In a way that is true. Being miserable and depressed is anotheremotional addiction that people find so hard to break. It becomes theirvibrational state.Poor MeThe “poor me” mentality is the most destructive state of mind it is possible toexperience. It is the means through which we create unhappy, unfulfilled lives,and the state of mind that allows a tiny few to control the direction of theworld. Poor Me The Victim. And the victim mentality creates the victim reality.The spiral of despair. The Poor Me mentality is always searching for excuses forits suffering, failure, and lack of action to change its circumstances. The PoorMe prison is the most tightly guarded, has the biggest walls, and the prisonersshow the greatest reluctance to escape. At times in our lives when we are facedwith challenging circumstances, we all experience the Poor Me mentality. Formany, however, it becomes their home, their permanent mental and emotionalresidence. This world is awash with victims because the world is awash withpeople conditioned to see themselves as victims. Poor home, no money, bad luck,bad parents, prejudice. The Poor Me, victim mentality has no shortage of excusesfor its situation, nor people to blame for its plight. The worst thing we can doin these circumstances is to feed the Poor Me by sympathising with their“misfortune” and “bad luck”. We can have empathy with their pain, but the lastthing they need is someone confirming their Poor Me sense of self. Love takesmany forms and telling people what will create further “misfortune” and pain iscertainly not one of them. There are no victims. We just think we are and so wecreate that physical reality. We are persuaded that life is not for living, itis for surviving. We are so indoctrinated by this that any new vision in whichpeople are happy, prosperous and fulfilled, is dismissed as “idealistic” and notliving in the “real world”. In the “real world”, you see, people have to sufferand battle for survival. Anything else is “idealistic”. The survival mentalityabounds on planet Earth.“How are you today?”“Oh, you know, surviving, but there’s a lot worse off than me, I guess.Picture #107 [images/img_0107.png]94We are not here to simply survive or exist, nor to judge our own lives on thebasis that others suffer more and so we must be grateful for our lot. But if wethink we are - and so many do - that will be the nature of our life. Throughouthistory we have been sold the idea that you have to suffer and sacrifice now tocreate the good things we desire in the “future”. What we really want to have inour lives are always in the future, never the now. Religions have told us weneed to suffer and sacrifice in this life to qualify for paradise... tomorrow.Politicians and economists tell us we need to make sacrifices now to createeconomic prosperity... tomorrow. The jam is always tomorrow It is what I callthe “one day” syndrome. One day I’ll have what I want, but not now. If that isour reality, our imagination of self, we will never have what we desire becausethat energy is always projected into the future and not into the now. Hope isanother example of living in the future. Hope is a future experience, not a nowexperience. As the Cretan writer, Nikos Kazantzakhs once wrote: “I am withouthope. I am without fear. I am free.”No-one feeds the victim mentality more than people on the “left” of politics,the Robot Radical mentality as I call it. This state of mind occupies a mentalworld of “us and them”, of victimiser and victim. The masses are victims becauseof the victimising few, this mentality believes. They see life in terms of thebosses and the bossed, the leaders and the led. The Robot Radicals’ sense ofreality, their imagination of themselves, is the fighter for freedom and justicefor the victims. The way to do this, they believe, is to constantly tell peoplethey are victims of circumstance, victims of someone else, and that only whenthat someone else is changed or removed will they cease to be victims ofcircumstance. The Robot Radical state of being actually needs victims to feedits sense of self. Without perceived victims, it would lose its sense ofidentity. If victims did not exist, this mentality would have to invent them.They also have so much anger within themselves that they are constantlysearching for people and circumstances to get angry about. This is why you oftensee the same faces at every protest march and also why those of the RobotRadical mentality have protested against me without reading my books or hearingme speak. They want to believe that what is said about me is true. It allowsthem to get angry with someone to avoid looking at the source of that anger -themselves.It is appropriate that the Robot Radical organisations often have “anti” intheir names like the Anti-Nazi League, Green Anti-Fascists, etc. They are stuckin the negative and their view of life would changePicture #108 [images/img_0108.png]95dramatically if they started to be “for” things. Most of the Robot Radicals dowhat they do out of the best of intention. I was on the fringes of thatmentality at one time. I saw myself in the British Green Party as a “fighter”for justice for those less “privileged”. But you don’t “fight” for freedom, you“peace” for freedom. I am not challenging the Robot Radical mentality from aholier than thou position. Robot Radicals are not “bad” people and that includesthose who have sought to give me a hard time personally. But, I would suggest,they are actually defeating their objective because they are feeding andfuelling the very mentality which is creating the ills they say they want toeliminate. Robot Radicals won’t like what I am about to say, but I want to seepeople take back their own power. That’s my motivation for what I do. I am nottrying to win a popularity contest. Robot Radicals had better sit down, have astiff drink, and, ideally, a whiff of oxygen...Single parent families, those in poor housing and no housing, and the endlessstream of other “victims” trotted out by the Robot Radicals are not the resultof bad luck or misfortune. They are the creation of their own thoughts, theirown imagination of themselves, or their own choices made before incarnation.They don’t need people telling them how unlucky and victimised they are. They’realready convinced of that. They need a new vision of themselves which willcreate a new and positive physical reality. They have thought theircircumstances into existence and they can just as easily think them out again.“Get off your ass and stop feeling sorry for yourself’ is often the most lovingadvice you can give to someone. They won’t thank you for it at first and theymight even become abusive. But true love is to say what people need to hear, notnecessarily what they want to hear to confirm their sense of Poor Me. Whatevercircumstances we are bom into, we choose them before birth. The alternatives tothis are that life is a random accident or that the consciousness is createdwith the body, neither of which stand up to serious discussion. That leaves aneternal consciousness deciding its own experience by choosing when, where, andwith whom to incarnate. You didn’t like your childhood? Then why did you chooseit? What were you hoping to learn from those circumstances? Fine, so leam andmove on. Look at things in that positive way and you can let go of the guilt andresentment from the past that does so much to destroy our present. You don’tlike your life now? Ok, what is it about your sense of self, your imagination ofyourself, that is creating it? You don’t deserve to live in poverty or pain.No-one does. We are all of equal worth, value, and potential. So whyPicture #109 [images/img_0109.png]96are you creating poverty and pain? I don’t care who you are, you are anincredible, astonishing, aspect of God. Express that infinity and your life willreflect that. See yourself as small, insignificant, an “ordinary” man and womanin the street, and you will be. You can see life as a series of problems or aseries of solutions. It’s a choice and the lives those states of mind createwill be very different.Ironically, few states of mind need to understand this more than the RobotRadicals who set themselves up as freedom fighters for victims. In troth, theyoften create victims instead of freeing them. We can only free ourselves. No-onecan do it for us. Robot Radicals see themselves as victims and they feed thevictim mentality with almost every word and pronouncement. “You were bom on acouncil estate in bad housing or in poverty in a New York slum? You are avictim. It’s the bosses, you know. They’re to blame for your situation. Wevictims must stand together in victimised solidarity. Raise the victims’ flagbrothers and sisters.” I was brought up on a vast council housing estate inLeicester in a poor family and I remember the “us and them” indoctrination thatwent on. All it did was condition me to see myself as a victim of circumstanceand someone who would always struggle financially because I was an “us” and nota “them”. That is exactly what happened to me until I realised what a load ofold tosh that is and I began to create another reality. How often have I heardthis: “I was bom working class and I’ll always be working class.”? Oh really?Not planning to evolve then? It’s got so silly that where you stand in the RobotRadical league table of political purity depends on how badly off you are. It isthe Robot Radical version of suffer little children to come unto me. Pain, whichshould only be a warning signal that something is out of balance, has beenintegrated into our minute by minute existence. Feeling pain is now “normal” inthis crazy world our minds have created and to a Robot Radical, and many in theNew Age too, pain has taken on the role of a medal, a symbol of your credibilityas a fully fledged, official, mentioned-in-dispatches, victim. Ahh, poor soul.To win the championship in the Robot Radical league table you have to suffermore than anyone else! If you are a black, lesbian, single-parent, on socialsecurity, squatting in a derelict house, you go straight to the top of the RobotRadical league table of human victims. “It’s not fair. That woman is so unlucky.She’s just a victim of her own bad luck, poverty, colour, and sexuality.”No she’s not. She is an incredible, amazing, aspect of all that exists and shecan be whatever she wants to be. She chose to be black, just asPicture #110 [images/img_0110.png]97people choose to be white, Arabs, Jews, and so on. She is not a victim. She hasonly been persuaded that she is a victim and so her life reflects that sense ofreality. She needs a new vision of herself, not crocodile tears. Victims don’tdo anything about their circumstances because they believe they are powerless todo anything and so nothing gets done. It’s someone else’s fault so someone elsewill have to get me out of this mess. What are they going to do about it?, comesthe victims’ cry. Don’t get me wrong here. I am not saying that we should ignorethe circumstances of others, nor am I belittling the plight of some blackpeople, lesbians, single-parent families, and the homeless. Quite the opposite.But I want to get to the real solution to the circumstances they are facing andthat means wading waist high through generations of bullshit from self-styled“radicals” who have massaged their own sense of purity while avoiding the wholepoint: if we want our lives to change, we have to change them.When people change their sense of self, when they stop seeing themselves as avictim, their energy pattern changes. It begins to magnetically attract to themthe people, places, experiences, “coincidences” and “luck” which change theircircumstances from the negative (a reflection of the old self) to positive (thenew self). It is then, and only then, that people in trouble can be helped.While they retain the Poor Me mentality there is nothing anyone can do. Nothingwill work no matter how hard you try, because their magnetic consciousness willcontinue to create the physical life that befits a victim. Throughout thiscentury and before, we have seen a stream of people and politicians all over theworld offering their physical solutions to what are, in truth, mental andemotional problems. This is why these “solutions” never work. All they do iscreate structures of dependency (control) and dependency diminishes our selfworth, our imagination of ourselves, so creating the very circumstances thestructures are supposed to be alleviating. The structure itself becomes avehicle of control, not freedom.You can’t change a mental state with a penny offincome tax or another pound on social security.Throughout this same period the number of “victims” world-wide has grown becausethose who say they wish to remove the problem go on feeding it. If you are bomblack or Jewish, for example, you are likely to be conditioned to expectprejudice. So that is what you get. If you are walking down the street, you willmagnetically attract the racist mentality because you will be fulfilling yourown sense of reality. The same with a homosexual. If you expect prejudice, if itis part of yourPicture #111 [images/img_0111.png]98imagination of yourself, you will not be disappointed. The mentality thatimagines itself as a victim of prejudice helps to create prejudice becausewithout it that sense of self, that imagination of self, could not be fulfilled.Attracting prejudice is no different to me attracting barking, aggressive dogsas a child while my friends had no such problems. Yet what do we see? “Communityleaders” representing groups of collective “victims” like blacks, Jews andhomosexuals, who tell their version of “the masses” that they are victims ofcircumstances created by others. Yeah, just what they need, that is, eh? It isall so self perpetuating and avoids the only solution changing our sense ofself.If we love and respect ourselves and stop seeing ourselves as victims, thatsense of self is broadcast in our magnetic vibration. That will attract to uspeople and circumstances that mirror back that love and respect. When thoseblacks, Jews and homosexuals, stop seeing themselves as victims of prejudice andlet go of any prejudices they may have against other groups, the prejudice andvictimisation against them will end. But not until.Let us look at this from the global perspective. The sum total of individualhuman reality becomes the collective reality - the world. You can see that ashuman consciousness has become more globally uniform, this has been reflectedphysically in the way cities all over the planet, which once expressed theirunique culture, are increasingly looking the same. As consciousness becomes moreuniform, so does the physical environment it creates. Politics is anotherexample of this principle. People condemn politicians for thinking only in termsof self interest and what’s in it for me. But what is in the hearts and minds ofmost voters when they are deciding which party to support? Yes, precisely: selfinterest and what’s in it for me. If that is our motivation when we vote, wewill, and do, create that reality by electing politicians who reflect in theiractions the very state of mind that we used to give them their power. If youwant to change the kind of politicians that represent us, change yourself. Ifpeople still think it is worth voting in today’s rigged system (I don’t), thenlet us vote for what we believe is right and not only for what we believe isright for us, materially, in the short term. Then, if this is done by enoughpeople, we will have politicians that manifest that state of mind.The same principle applies to the pyramid of global control I described earlier.We created that too, without realising it. If we give our minds away and stopthinking for ourselves, we are allowing others, governments. Elite families,community leaders, priests, teachers, thePicture #112 [images/img_0112.png]99media, and pseudo-gurus of all shades, to tell us what we are and how we shouldsee ourselves. They are programmed to programme the rest of us. We are allowingthem to condition our imagination of ourselves and the world and so allowingthem to create our physical reality. When we concede our right to be unique andwe accept another’s version of what we should be, we allow others to control ourphysical experience. That is precisely what the human race as a whole has doneand continues to do. The Hassle-Free Zone is populated by those who areprojecting a programmed sense of self as a physical reality which wecollectively call the “world” or “society”. There are so few real differences inthe basic mentality within the Hassle-Free Zone because people are getting theirprogrammed sense of self from the same basic source, the pyramid of conformity,the Global Elite which controls the sources of “information” and indoctrinationthat hypnotise our consciousness. Today even more subtle forms of realityprogramming go on thanks to subliminal messages, often via the television, whichspeak directly to the subconscious in ways the conscious mind cannot see orhear. Make no mistake, those who work to programme human reality know exactlyhow to do it, because they are working with knowledge passed on secretly overthousands of years via the upper levels of the global secret society network,the origins of which go back to Atlantis and beyond. This is the same knowledgethat has been kept out of the public arena by the twin responses of “mad” and“bad”.We can remove the means of this control by ceasing to conform and by using ourown immense power to effect positive change. This can be done in very simpleways. You can sit quietly and visualise whatever you want to create foryourself. See it happening to you now in that moment. Thought creates exactlywhat you think, so if you visualise something happening in the future it willalways be happening in the future and never in the now. You can use this sametechnique, perhaps with a group, to visualise and project the thought form ofpeace, love, harmony and the end of conflict. These visualisations do workbecause thev are concentrated thought and thought creates everything. Only ifwhat you desire is not appropriate to your life experience will a higher levelof yourself block it. Also, it is important to remember the chain reaction ofwords and behaviour. What we say and do is like throwing a pebble into a pond.The waves continue to affect the water long after the pebble has gone. If youwalk into a shop and you are nasty and unpleasant to the shop keeper, it willmake him angry and wound up. After you leave he will be less than pleasant tohis next customer orPicture #113 [images/img_0113.png]100his wife and family. This will upset them and so it goes on. But this chainreaction can be used positively. If we knock on the door of the boss no-onelikes and say we think he is doing a great job and what a pleasure it is to workwith him, it is likely to make his day. Nobody will have said that to himbefore. He will be lifted by the compliment and this is likely to be reflectedin the way he treats his staff. In turn, they will feel happier and enjoy theirwork, thus they are more likely to be pleasant to their families when they gohome. It’s only a choice and we constantly underestimate the effect on the worldof the so called “little” things that we say and do. Every time we think or feelwe affect the sea of electromagnetic energy and affect everything that exists.And, of course, if we are loving and pleasant to others because we feel happyand loving inside, that state of being will attract the same reaction to us. Howwe treat each other in the supermarket or the office may not appear to berevolutionary, but it is. If we are loving and pleasant to each other in ourdaily lives and if we use the power of our minds to think love, peace, andharmony, we break the very foundations that hold the pyramid of control together- fear, guilt, resentment, judgment2, competition and aggression.Today our generations are being offered an opportunity unprecedented for atleast twelve thousand years and probably far, far longer. It is the opportunityfor a mass evacuation of the human prison. If we choose to grasp it, we can bepart of the Great Cleansing of Planet Earth and the human mind which so many arenow experiencing. It is the moment we have prepared for over many lifetimes.This opportunity is not only for some “chosen people” or chosen few No-one ischosen. We make the choices ourselves. This gathering transformation is foranyone and everyone. Once again, YOU are in control. You always were and youalways are.2 I think it is worth defining what I mean by judgment, and therefore beingnonjudgmental. I do not mean looking the other way when we see things we don'tlike because to say anything would be “judgmental”. That form ofnon-judgmentalism denies the right to have opinions and express them. Bynon-judgment, I mean to say what we think about attitudes and behaviour whilerealising that we are not challenging the people involved, but the thoughtpatterns and states of mind which control those people.Picture #114 [images/img_0114.png]101Chapter 6Set The Genie FreeI imagine a wine bottle standing on a light. Inside is a moth. The top of thebottle is open and the moth can escape any time. But the moth does not escape.It can’t see the opening at the top because it stays at the bottom, mesmerisedby the light. So eventually it dies, still unaware that the door was open toinfinity ah along.For moth, read human race.Our “light”, the hypnosis that holds us at the bottom of an open bottle, is theinvasion of the psyche by mantra messages of dos and don’ts, wills and won’ts,shalls and shan’ts, couldn’ts and can’ts. It also includes all those who acceptand feed the victim mentality and the ‘’scientists” who tell us that not only isthe bottle tightly closed, there is nowhere outside to escape to even if wecould. The bottle is ah that exists. These messages constantly increase theenergy which powers the light and disempowers the people. We are the genie inthe bottle and it is time to escape. The cork was never there, we were justduped into believing it was.The symbolism of the bottle is very appropriate because we exist, at this levelof ourselves, anyway, in a vortex of energy which is shaped not unlike a bottle(Figure 4 overleaf). This spiral of multidimensional energy is like a cinemascreen on which the game, the ride, we call physical life is played out. Youcould imagine this vortex of experience as a pyramid with a circle at its peak(Figure 5 - see page 104). You can see in a cinema how the projection of thepicture is like a pyramid. When it leaves the projector the picture is verysmall, but by the time it reaches the screen, it has expanded massively. Look ata spotlight in a theatre and you will see the same principle. The beam of lightwidens the further it travels. The circle at the top of the pyramid in Figure 4represents the Oneness of where we come from. It is a “heaven” of 5'Picture #115 [images/img_0115.png]Picture #116 [images/img_0116.png]103balance and harmony between what are, at this physical level, “opposing” forcesof positive and negative, male and female. The Global Elite and the cult of theAll Seeing Eye are the physical responsibilities of the negative extreme in thispositive-negative, malefemale duality, but they are still part of the whole andtherefore part of us. Oneness is the collective mind that created a vortex whichseparated the elements within the Oneness. It was designed as a spiritualuniversity and a very tough school. It is within that vortex that our densephysical world exists. It is one of perhaps nine time-space planes or dimensions- “worlds” - within the vortex. These planes are the many mansions in myfather’s house” which Y’shua (lesus) is reputed to have talked about. All theselevels are connected vibrationally and what happens to one affects them all.They each vibrate to a different “note” (wavelength), but all the notes are partof the same tune. Each higher dimension is responsible for guiding the one belowwhich, again, is where the ancient idea of the guiding “gods” originates - fromthe dimension above ours. We are in a three dimensional world or the ThirdDimension which is near the bottom of the pyramid. Each dimension has a“physical” level (gradually becoming less dense the closer they are to Oneness)and a non-physical level to where consciousness returns between physicalincarnations. The diagram is very simple and there are many more wavelengths,worlds, and subtleties involved, of course, but it summarises the general theme.When I say that we are God and that all is God, I don’t mean that we are all atthe same level of understanding. Within this infinite mind/ energy that iseverything, are infinite levels of love, knowledge, and wisdom. At the highestvibration, at the heart of God, is what I call the Source Consciousness. This isthe mind from which all else has come. What is the Source? The Source is Love.And Love is Oneness, the balance of all. How do we return to the Source? We loveourselves and we love every other expression of God. We love and become love.Loving God means loving everything because everything is God. That includes theGlobal Elite and those exposed in chapter four. No-one needs love more than theydo.Understanding Oneness in the deepest sense comes from experiencing the divisionof Oneness. You only understand the balance between hot and cold by experiencingboth hot and cold. You only know when you have achieved balance because you haveexperienced imbalance. This spiritual journey is like a pair of scales leapingfrom one side to the other until, with the passage of experience, the ThePicture #117 [images/img_0117.png]104The Multiscreen CinemaONENESS/ / Ninth Dimension \\ \\Male / / \\ \\ FemaleenerSV j Eighth Dimension \\ Viner®'j j Seventh Dimension \\ 'Sixth DimensionFifth DimensionPicture #118 [images/img_0118.png]Fourth DimensionThree dimensional universe The Third Dimension (here!)Picture #119 [images/img_0119.png]Second DimensionFirst DimensionThe virtual reality vortex/pyramid. Levels of our consciousness exist on allthese planes of existence, including Oneness.Figure 5Picture #120 [images/img_0120.png]Picture #121 [images/img_0121.png]Picture #122 [images/img_0122.png]Picture #123 [images/img_0123.png]Picture #124 [images/img_0124.png]105movement slows and slows and the balance point, Oneness, is found. This is whythe ride can feel bumpy when the scales are flying around. The vortex, the moviepicture projected from the level of Oneness, is symbolised by the concept of Godbreathing out, which you find in some Eastern religions and elsewhere. Thatsymbolic “outbreath” was the projection of the vortex from the Oneness thatcaused the separation of male and female, positive and negative, which, when inharmony, make One. The “outbreath” of separation and creation is the male energyand the “inbreath”, the nurturing back to Oneness is the female energy nowre-emerging on Planet Earth. As with the cinema projector, the further away fromOneness the vortex travelled, the wider it expanded and the greater theseparation of “opposites”. The wider that separation the slower the energyvibrated and so at the bottom levels of the vortex (that symbolic bottle) thedense physical world formed. What we call “matter” is only energy condensed to aslow vibration.You can see this expressed in the world around us. The rocks operate on a longerwavelength, a very slow vibration, and so their matter is very “solid”. Ourbodies vibrate to a shorter, quicker, frequency and so they are less “solid”than a rock. Our consciousness vibrates on an even quicker wavelength and is,therefore, out of range of the body’s physical senses. We have to expand ourminds, increase our vibratory rate, and use our psychic “third eye” sight if wewish to see such levels. The task of those who chose to take part in thislearning experiment was, and still is, to experience division and through thatto bring those “opposites” back into balance within us. As that balance isachieved, our vibratory rate quickens and we ascend up the frequency levelswithin the pyramid/vortex towards our real home - Oneness. Symbolically, theProdigal Son returns home to “the Father”.Let us get this straight. People talk about living in the “real world” as if thedivisions, pain, and control of this dense physical planet were the “realworld”. That is the last thing it is. The “real world”, if you want to put itlike that, is the level of highly evolved existence called Oneness. The worldyou see through your eyes is a holographic, three dimensional, virtual realitygame created by Oneness as a vast learning experience. When you look throughyour eyes it is like donning one of those virtual reality helmets you get withcomputer games. We are looking at a cinema screen, that’s all. This world is notreal, it is a spiritual Hollywood. A movie set. A hologram is a threedimensional image created by the manipulation of light. You can buy holograms inPicture #125 [images/img_0125.png]106gift shops and holographic images of people can be projected onto the stage intheatre productions. Creating a hologram is very straight forward. Also, everypart of a hologram is an image of the whole. The only thing you lose, thesmaller you go, is detail. That is exactly what we are, a part of the gigantichologram we call the universe and we are a smaller image of the whole of thathologram - the universe. We just don’t manifest all of the detail. In the sameway, every cell in our body holds the information contained in the whole body.As above so below, as they say. Everything is a reflection of everything, nomatter how small. There is actually no here or there, only everywhere. The hereand there are merely the section of everywhere that our senses are perceiving atany moment. If you walk around a department store you are only seeing onedepartment at a time. But go outside (symbolic of expanding our consciousness tohigher levels) and you can see the whole building which contains all thedepartments.Oneness created the foundations of this time space reality, the thought form andvibrational interaction which built the “movie set”. But it is we who make thefilm. It is we who decide which parts we will play, who with, and in whatsetting. It is we who write the script and create a physical reality to matchthe imagination we have of ourselves and our part in the picture. It can be anice family film full of love and respect or it can be a horror movie. We, you,all of us, decide that. Noone else. No “God”, no “random accidents”, we do it.You think your life is a horror movie? It will be. You think of yourself as theguy who gets shot early in the film? You will be. You think of yourself as oneof those who end up laughing and happy in the last scene? You will be. What partdo you want to play? Then think it and live it. Great, you got the job. Cuecamera - action!Now, let’s stop fighting each other and condemning each other. Let us insteadlove ourselves, love each other, find balance, and get out of here! Let’s go!The opportunity to do just that is being presented to us like never before sincethe vortex was created. “God” is breathing in. We are being pulled back towardsOneness - if we choose to go. The effects of dividing Oneness so comprehensivelywere possibly underestimated. The division has become a prison within which theprisoners are so mesmerised by the cell that they can conceive of no otherreality. Symbolically, I see people existing in an eggshell (Figure 6). Insidethe shell is our conscious level, that part of us that looks through the eyesand experiences the conditioning of this dense physical world.Picture #126 [images/img_0126.png]Picture #127 [images/img_0127.png]Figure 6: The Eggshell of programmed thought and response -the self-imposedbarrier to our infinity.Picture #128 [images/img_0128.png]108Outside the shell is the rest of creation, the sea of electromagnetic energy andour multidimensional consciousness expanding into infinity. Keeping the twoapart is the eggshell which is the veneer of programmed thought and response,created by lifetimes of fear, guilt and resentment, and of: you must, youshould, you won’t and you can’t. The eggshell is our personal Hassle-Free Zone.We don’t have to “seek” enlightenment, it is sitting there patiently waiting forus. It has always been there. Ignorance and enlightenment share the same spaceas each other. We simply need to remove the barrier, the shell of conditionedthought, which has caused the disconnection from our infinite self and theSource Of All That Is. Crack the eggshell, shatter it into a thousand pieces bychanging the way you see yourself, open your heart and mind, and all levels ofyou will be reunited. A little help is required to speed this process and thathelp is here, not least in the form of “extraterrestrial” activity which willexpand enormously in the years ahead until we eventually interact with peoplefrom other time-space dimensions in the same way that we mix with people ofdifferent countries on Earth. But, once again, within this free-will virtualreality, it is we who must decide if we wish to accept such support.Each time-space dimension within the vortex/pyramid is sharing the same space asall the others, just as radio and television frequencies share the same space.They operate in different “worlds” unaware of the other’s existence. However,frequencies very close on the radio band can interfere with each other. So it iswithin the vortex. On the dimension next to ours, what I will call the FourthDimension, are two opposing forces, male-female, positive-negative, which havefought over hundreds of thousands of our years for control of this densephysical world. Two of their manifestations on Earth were the civilisationsknown as Lemuria and Atlantis. This battle on the Fourth Dimension has beensymbolised in ancient texts as the “battle in the heavens” and the “battle ofthe Gods”. We see it symbolised by Hollywood in films like Star Wars and TheEmpire Strikes Back. It is a tussle between two elements of Oneness separatedwithin the vortex. Light and Dark is the way that some people describe it, butit is really two shades of imbalance at war with each other. And it is thissometimes turbulent fourth dimension which has the role in the movie of guidingour third dimension back to Oneness! Someone there lost the script and if twosides involved in an enormous spiritual tussle have been guiding this dimensionit does explain rather well how humanity lost its way. That does not mean thatall of the fourth dimensional reality is inPicture #129 [images/img_0129.png]109trauma, only some significant elements within it. Wonderful gifts of love,understanding, and discovery have been transmitted to us from that dimensionwhich have enriched human life and there is a tremendous amount of supportcoming to us from that dimension today. On the Fourth Dimension is knowledge oftechnology beyond our dreams, but because of the divisions this has been abusedat times. Knowledge without wisdom, technological invention without love, can bevery unpleasant combinations. It is from this fourth dimension and higher thatat least most of the “UFOs” come, both positive and negative. The scale of theUFO-extraterrestrial cover up is extraordinary and so is the manipulation ofthis phenomenon by the Global Elite. The fear of extraterrestrial “invasion” isbeing used to justify a world government and army. Hollywood films are beingproduced with this theme as part of the conditioning. The genuine space crafthave the ability to change their vibratory state and “switch” dimensions. Whenthey do, they disappear to our physical senses. They have not actuallydisappeared, they have merely left our time-space reality - the frequency rangein which our physical sight and other senses operate. It’s like moving the radiodial. Many of these craft and beings might even be thought forms transmittedfrom the Fourth Dimension which only manifest as “craft”.The Earth, the solar system, and the universe, exist on all the timespacedimensions within the pyramid. While the Moon and the planets of the solarsystem may seem to be lifeless to our physical senses, we are only seeing themfrom our dimension. On other dimensions those same planets are teeming havens oflife. The same with the stars. We see the Earth from the perspective of ourphysical frequency range, but the Earth exists on all of these other dimensions,too, and it may look very different on some of them to the one we experiencehere. But it is still the same multidimensional Earth. Our consciousness is alsomultidimensional and levels of us exist on these other dimensions, too! We arelike those Russian dolls, one inside the other, but we have become disconnectedfrom most of them which is why our perspective has been so limited. I rememberhow a very sensitive psychic friend once had a vision of me addressing what shecalled millions of people. “It is you” she said “But it is you on another level,not this one”. It seemed a strange idea at the time, but not anymore. What shesaw was not the physical “me” which is tapping the keys of this word processor,it was that part of my multidimensional consciousness which is experiencing thatother dimension. A level of us is experiencing everyPicture #130 [images/img_0130.png]110dimension within the vortex right up to Oneness. Each is another actor playingits chosen part on this multiscreen “cinema” within the vortex, learning andevolving with each new experience. Not only did the pyramidic movie projectionseparate into “worlds” of experience, it separated the Oneness of those whochose to take part in the experiment. As the pyramid rolls back into Oneness andwe rise up the dimensions, we become One with each of our separated levels inturn until we are “whole” again. At that moment, we will be back to our state ofOneness and we will have access to the experience and learning that every levelof us has absorbed. And, come to that, what every level of everyone else hasabsorbed within the vortex. The learning will be incredible and all of creationwill evolve as a result. It is like one student separating into many studentswho then go off to different universities, studying different subjects, andexperiencing different lifestyles, attitudes, and ways of hating and loving.Then they all return to each other and swap notes and stories. So while we maybe experiencing a positive life here, another aspect of us may be a “villain”somewhere else. It’s just an experience and it makes the judgment of others soludicrous. While I challenge states of mind like the “farRight”, ChristianPatriotism, and the Robot Radicals, the people tuned to those mental andemotional states are having an experience from which they, and all of us, willleam. It’s a game, a ride. We are each other, no matter what any of those“others” may be doing. The extraterrestrials who are dubbed “aliens” areactually other aspects of ourselves. They are not “alien” at all. They are partof us. These vortexes of learning in specific, artificially created, conditionscan be found throughout the infinite mind we call God. They are vortexes,eddies, within the river of consciousness that flows to infinity. These vortexesof experience allow God (us) to experience His/Her self and understand theextent of His/Her potential: we are all One consciousness experiencing itselfsubjectively.If we are to evolve, to balance and raise ourselves back up the levels toOneness, we need to remember who and what we are. Without that, we will remainlike the moth in the bottle, unaware of the means of escape. And the pyramid ofexperience cannot roll back into Oneness again until the dense physical levelmoves. It will continue to be a lead weight holding down all the rest and thetime has arrived for the experiment to move on. It is time to become One againwith our multidimensional selves and “God” in general. This could not happenwithout support and guidance from the level of Oneness because wePicture #131 [images/img_0131.png]Illhave created such illusion within ourselves that we have forgotten who we are,where we came from, and what we are part of. We are the prodigal son who left“the Father” (Oneness) to experience and then lost his way. But, just as theprodigal son returned to a welcoming “father”, so we have the opportunity now todo the same. It is my strong belief that a “team” of “volunteers” came out ofthe Oneness to help with the transition from separation and division to balanceand harmony. These multidimensional volunteers (consciousness) are operating onall dimensions within the vortex offering information which will help people toremember that they are taking part in a game. It is not real. The toughest taskis faced by those operating in this dense physical world because the density hasadded to the spiritual amnesia which has disconnected people from their eternalmemory. They have forgotten who they are, where they came from, and what thehell they are doing here. I think that even some of this volunteer consciousnesshas become so hypnotised by the light at the bottom of the bottle that it, too,has forgotten what it is here to do! Many are called, but few serve. Enough havestayed awake, however, to do the job. Examples of this volunteer consciousnesscan be found throughout history and they include some, though most certainly notall, of the figures which later had religions founded in their names. Y’shua(lesus) was possibly among them and the difficulties he encountered were causedby interference from the Fourth Dimension. When he left this world, his wordswere turned on their head and used as the foundations for a religion, inspiredfrom the Fourth Dimension, which has been the epitome of everything he came tochallenge.Life on this dense physical dimension has been made more difficult by theinterference from the Fourth Dimension. It is from there, as I have indicated,that the so called “gods” of ancient legend originate. Elements of thisconsciousness have manipulated this world throughout known history and before.It is the “Prison Warder” consciousness, as I call it in ... and the truth shallset you free, and I believe it has a physical extraterrestrial expression on,and under, the Earth today. What is the common theme that connects the thoughtcontrol of religion going back thousands of years and the thought control oftoday’s politicaleconomic-military-media-industrial complex? The manipulation byelements in the Fourth Dimension via the minds of those here in the Third andmaybe even more directly as a physical form. The negative consciousnessoperating on the Fourth Dimension created, either though direct incarnation orthought manipulation, the religions andPicture #132 [images/img_0132.png]112various creeds which have controlled, divided, and ruled this world forthousands of years. It was also the source of the belief inthis-world-isall-there-is “science”. It was behind the creation of the educationsystem, the legal (in)justice system, the wars, the interest-on-money bankingcartels, and it is the force that is pressing, via its physical puppets ordirect, incarnate, representatives, for a world government, central bank,currency, and army, together with a microchipped population.The Global Elite are either incarnations or physical projections of this extremenegative consciousness which people call Satanic, or, in other cases, they arepossessed by it. So it has been for thousands of years going back to ancientEgypt, Babylon, etc. These Fourth Dimensional “Satanic” manipulators have theirsymbolism in all areas of society because they created all the vehicles ofcontrol. One of the main channels of interaction between the Fourth Dimensionand its Third Dimensional representatives and puppets is the upper levels of theglobal secret society network in which the initiation ceremonies can create avibrational connection between the initiate (puppet) and the Fourth Dimensionalmanipulators. Symbols like the Pyramid, All Seeing Eye and many others which goback into ancient times are still those of the secret society network todaybecause they are the Satanic symbols of this highly imbalanced element of theFourth Dimension. The Satanic rites and grotesque human sacrifices still goingon today are designed to create huge amounts of extreme negative energy on whichthis consciousness feeds. This “Satanic” consciousness is extreme negativeenergy and so the more of this energy that can be produced in the threedimensional world, the more power the consciousness has to manipulate thisplanet. Humanity is then operating on a negative vibrational playing fieldwithin the vibrational range of the “Satanic” consciousness. This is why animaland human sacrifices which abound throughout human history still continue today.Some of this even goes on openly. What is a slaughterhouse if not a place forthe sacrifice of animals, thus creating enormous terror and pain extremenegative energy? The spilling of blood is very important to this consciousnessand its Global Elite/extraterrestrial puppets on Earth. The United Nationsbuilding in New York is built on land given free by the Rockefellers. It is thesite of a former slaughterhouse. The Satanic force is symbolised by the AllSeeing Eye of Lucifer at the peak of the pyramid and it operates through theGlobal Elite. The same force has been controlling and manipulating the planetfor at least hundredsPicture #133 [images/img_0133.png]113of thousands of years, probably a lot longer. But it is vital that we don’treact to this consciousness with hatred, fear and aggression. It needs our lovebecause it is the absence of love that has led to its current imbalanced state.Hatred, fear and aggression are the emotions it wants to stimulate. They are itspower.At their highest levels those who control the secret society network knowinglyserve their Fourth Dimensional and extraterrestrial “masters”. Nor is itcoincidence that the Pyramid and All Seeing Eye are on the reverse of the GreatSeal of the United States and on the dollar bill. Representatives and puppetsfor the negative elements of the Fourth Dimension were behind the creation ofthe United States and control it to this day, as they do the global bankingsystem, the intelligence agencies, political system, the media, and so on. Somepeople believe that another symbol of the Fourth Dimensional manipulators is theblack gown. What is the attire worn by Christian clergy and representatives ofmany other religions? A black gown. What is the colour of the legal profession,barristers, many judges and such like? Black. What is the symbol of success inthe education system or the top of the teaching profession? A black gown. TheFourth Dimensional thought manipulators inspired all of these institutions ofcontrol. In Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back what was the colour worn bythe “baddie”, Darth Vader? Black with a Nazi helmet, appropriately, because theFourth Dimensional manipulators were the force behind the Nazis, too. If youread . . .and the truth shall set you free, you will appreciate how and why theNazis were created. Darth Vader was the symbol of what I have called theLuciferic or Satanic Consciousness, the Fourth Dimensional source which hasmanipulated our three dimensional world. Hollywood, especially the films bySteven Spielberg like Raiders Of The Lost Ark, are full of symbolism whichbetrays a wide knowledge of the true story behind the manipulation of thisworld.The mentality known as the Illuminati or Global Elite, the few who control thedirection of the world by conditioning the mass consciousness, have theirorigin, guidance and motivation in the Fourth Dimension and its extraterrestrialexpression. This is how the same force that was responsible for the creation ofreligion is also the force behind the plan to microchip everyone and link themto a global computer. Ironically, those Christians who rightly oppose themicrochipping of people and the other plans of the New World Order, arefollowing a religious belief system manipulated into being by thePicture #134 [images/img_0134.png]114same Fourth Dimensional consciousness which is behind the microchipping!Look at the common objective between all of these apparently “separate”, even“opposite” creations of the Fourth Dimensional manipulators: control of thehuman mind. It does not matter to them if we are mind-controlled by a religion,a political “ism”, an economic theory, the “education” system or a “scientific”belief in some after-life nothingness. You want your mind-controlled, sir? Good,come in, look around, I’m sure you’ll find something that’s just right for yourstate of being. We don’t care which one you choose. All you do is pick your formof designer thought control, hand over your mind to us, and away you go.Couldn’t be simpler. Oh, you fancy the Jesus-died-so-our-sinscould-be-forgivenmodel? Wise choice, if I may say so, and it also comes with an optionalwave-the-flag-for-America, God-is-on-our-side, attachment and today’s specialgiveaway, George Washington singing Land Of The Free. Thank you, sir, that willcost you only one mind and a thousand self-delusions. Next time you come, youcan pay by microchip.Those imbalanced elements within the Fourth Dimension can only control anddirect events in this one if we give our minds away. That is why all thecreations df these manipulators, be it religion, finance, politics or \"science”,involve the hijacking of the human psyche. In this way they also hijackhumanity’s sense of self, its sense of reality, and its physical experience.When we take our power back and stop accepting another’s belief of what weshould be, we remove the ability of the few to mind-control the “masses”, themass human consciousness. Beliefs are limitations of vision and prisons of themind. We believe too much and feel too little. Only when we follow our feelings,instead of denying them, will we break the grip the manipulators have on so manypsyches. Go with the flow without fear of what others will think. The mostpowerful way to set ourselves free of the thinking, believing, fearing,intellect, is to celebrate our own uniqueness, allow everyone else to do thesame, and never seek to impose what we believe on another. I say anything goesunless there is imposition or pressure of any kind on anyone to do the same.That’s freedom.Part of the vibratory transformation now unfolding on this planet and thistime-space reality in general, is to cleanse the negative energies in the FourthDimension and remove their abuse of human free will. The whole vortex/pyramid isbeing transformed and that includes the Fourth Dimension. The ability of thisFourth Dimensional “Illuminati” toPicture #135 [images/img_0135.png]115impose its design on this world via the human “Illuminati” is being curtailed bythe day. We are in the last years of this control and with its interdimensionalpower source rapidly on the wane, if not already withdrawn, the Global Elitewill find it ever more difficult to achieve its end of global, political,economic and spiritual power over a microchipped, robotic population. The GlobalElite have reached their peak of power because the human population have reachedthe depths of giving their power away. From now, the only way is up. This isalready apparent to gathering millions who are awakening to a new vision ofthemselves and their destiny as their eggshells crack and they are reunited withhigher dimensions of themselves.Energies are being transmitted down from Oneness throughout the pyramid. Theseenergies, thought forms, are designed to harmonise and balance the separation.As this happens the movie sets created by the interaction of separatedpolarities begin to change because the circumstances which created them arechanging. If the dense physical world is created by the separation of negativeand positive, female and male, which slow the vibrations and form dense matter,then as the scale of that separation is reduced, the vibrations will quicken andthe dense physical world ceases to be. The movie sets manifest an ever closerconnection with Oneness as the energies move closer to that state of being.Conflict becomes less, love and understanding becomes more prevalent, and so onuntil we are back at the balance point we came from: Oneness. Game over. Whatshall we play now?This change is already well advanced. It has been creeping upon us unnoticed,just as the cracks in a dam can go unnoticed until just before the wholestructure is about to give way. For those with eyes that can see beyond thephysical illusions, the cracks are now very wide indeed and the dam is beginningto sway. A tidal wave of change is upon us and we can swim with that tide oragainst it. That is our choice, but the consequences of this choice will bevery, very different. We can let go of the rigidity and limitations of ourreality and potential, unload the emotional sewage in our subconscious, and fly,vibrationally, out through the top of the bottle and home. Or we can continue tobe mesmerised by the light at the bottom and wage war against the vibrationalchange the entire bottle is experiencing. In my view; the consequences of thatchoice will be deeply unpleasant, but it’s a choice we all have every right tomake. These high vibrational energies have travelled down the pyramid fromOneness, affecting and transforming the other dimensions within the vortex.Hence, the imbalances and divisions on the FourthPicture #136 [images/img_0136.png]116Dimension are being healed, and now that process is filtering down to this densephysical world of ours. These energies are having a gathering effect on theconsciousness of humanity and life on Earth. Again we are back toelectromagnetic energy fields and the sea of energy with which we constantlyinteract. As higher energies are introduced which raise the vibrational state ofthe global energy fields, everything is being affected, not least human thoughtand emotions.It may not seem to be obvious when you watch the TV news that we are in theprocess of transforming this planet from division and conflict to peace andharmony. There seems to be more unrest than ever. There is a reason for that.Whatever your state of being, it will usually settle into a sort of equilibrium.Put something on only one side of the scales and after a while the scales willsettle down into what you might call a balanced imbalance. The scales will bepushed down much further on one side, but they will eventually stop moving upand down and come to rest in that position. If you then put something of equalweight on the other side to balance the scales, the balance does not comeimmediately. Once again, the scales jump around for a while until they settledown into the new situation, in this case, balance. So whenever the scaleschange, it involves a rather chaotic period of readjustment. But in truth it isnot chaos at all, it is a natural, and essential, prerequisite to change. If youtake the symbolism of the scales to be the energy fields of the Earth andourselves, it expresses very well what we are experiencing now. The oldstructures (balanced imbalance) have reached the end of the line and they arecrumbling in the face of the energies ushering in the new world and new Earth(balance). I will talk about the effects on humanity a little later, but theeffects on the planet and the systems of nature are already apparent. Theincreasingly obvious changes in world weather patterns are not the result of theso called Greenhouse Effect in my view. They are being caused by the vibrationalchanges affecting the Earth’s energy fields. The scales are moving. The effectson the weather will continue to grow in the transitional period until, possibly,a pole shift completes the transformation from old energy field (time-spacedimension) to new. These high powered energies, which manifest in part as aphenomena known as the Photon Belt,1 2 are now being measured even by1 It is also important to note, however, that the Elite now have technology tomanipulate the weather for their own ends.2 See .. and the truth shall set you free and The Robots’ Rebellion.Picture #137 [images/img_0137.png]117conventional “science”. According to the London Daily Telegraph of July 5th1995, energies have been measured that have shattered popular “scientific”belief. The article said:“Something out there - no-one knows what - is hurling high energy particlesaround the universe, in this case the most energetic ever observed byscientists... Not even the power released by the most powerful exploding starscould account for them. Indeed conventional theory says such particles shouldnot exist...These energies, known by “science” as cosmic rays, are normally measured in therange of millions of electron volts power. Since 1992, the article said, theyhave been measured in a range of up to 320 billion billion electron volts. Andthese are only the energies that human “science” has so far developed thetechnology to measure. Most of the change is happening on vibrational levelsunknown and unmeasured by ‘’science”. But the human mind, heart, and emotionscan feel them far more sensitively than any technology. The Photon Belt, a fieldof highly, highly charged energy, is, 1 believe, responsible in part for thisincredible difference in the gathering power of the energies being measured.Many people believe that the solar system is now moving into the Photon Belt andthe effect of these energies will be felt more and more in terms of physicalchanges (weather, geological unrest) and, the root of all change, the awakeninghuman mind. Another enormous source of change is the spiritual and physicalheart of the solar system, the Sun. I was interested to read about the work ofthe researcher and writer, Maurice Cotterell, who studied the cycles of sun spotactivity the times when the Sun is emitting very powerful magnetic energieswhich travel to the Earth on what is known as the solar wind.3 He later cameacross the amazing mathematical system of numbers and symbols left by theancient Mayan people in Central America which claimed to measure the cycles ofhuman and Earth evolution. He was fascinated to realise that his cycles of sunspot (magnetic) activity corresponded very closely with the Mayan cycles ofhuman evolution, even those projected over thousands of years. This was no“coincidence”. Life is the interaction of magnetic energy fields. Change themagnetism and you change the nature of the energy field. Change the energy fieldand1 See The Mayan Prophecies by Adrian G. Gilbert and Maurice M. Cotterell,(Element Books, Shaftsbury, England, 1995).Picture #138 [images/img_0138.png]118you change the nature of “life”. That is happening now to Planet Earth. Look atso many of the ancient prophecies about great changes on Earth, be it nativepeoples like the Elopi tribe in the United States, the Maya, or psychics likeEdgar Cayce or Nostradamus, and they point to enormous change in the time periodwe are living through today. According to the Maya, the last Great Cycle of theEarth’s evolution began in 3114 BC and it is due to end in 2012 when another,very different, period of evolution will begin. Again same story, same basictimescale. The incoming energies have already awakened very large numbers ofpeople to see the world and themselves through far more open and perceptive eyesby helping them reconnect with higher levels of themselves which, up to thispoint, they had shut out. Those numbers are growing rapidly by the day. Everyonecan begin that same journey. It’s only a choice.No matter what the scale of change unfolding, this is not a time to panic. It isnever a time to panic! Life is forever and we are going through a cycle withinthe vortex which will allow us to begin the journey home to Oneness. Just as the“death” of Autumn and Winter is followed by the “birth” and “life” of Spring andSummer, so in the greater cycles of evolution, whole dimensions go through thissequence of “death” and “rebirth”. Spring, new birth and abundance, will followthis period of breakdown and change. No worries. How bumpy or spirituallyorgasmic the transition will be depends upon you and me and our imagination ofourselves and the “future”. If we think it will be catastrophic, so it will be.But it doesn’t have to be. We can imagine something different and create thatreality.We are what we think and the world is what we all think.Picture #139 [images/img_0139.png]119Chapter 7It’s A Piece A Shit, Walk AwayIf we are to complete our transition from ignorance to infinity, we need tofloat to the surface of the vibrational pyramid. That is easier than it maysound because our consciousness naturally gravitates towards Oneness, just asthe deep sea diver would float to the surface without the weights to hold himdown.Our “weights” are the emotional gunge in our subconscious, our programmed senseof self and reality, and the endless mind-numbing claptrap that assaults oureyes and ears via the media, the education (indoctrination) system, politicians,economists, and all the other mind doctors selling us their view of what ourreality should be. In short, the eggshell. Without those influences, that weighton our mind and emotions, the bird would have flown a long time ago. These arethe influences that create the light at the bottom of the bottle, hypuotising usand keeping us in ignorance of our true and infinite self. I remember listeningto a tape of the late Bill Hicks, the American comedian I mentioned before. Hewas talking about a film called Basic Instinct. His summary of the film: “Piecea shit”. However, great debate ensued about the picture. Was it too this or toothat? Much of this “debate” was hyped to promote the movie and Bill Hicksoffered the following advice:It’s a piece a shit, walk away.If humanity did that more often, it would not waste its energy day after day onirrelevant debate and argument over “issues” that are only there to divert usfrom what really matters - our own evolution out of ignorance and our ownability to love and be loved. But we get hooked in by these manufactured debatesand diversions. We see irrelevant events and statements as vitally important,instead of walking away and seeing them for what they are: irrelevantdiversions. It’s fascinating toPicture #140 [images/img_0140.png]120observe, as your mind expands and the cell door creaks open, how the issues andconcerns that occupy our minds, screw us up, and give us a bad sense of self,simply don’t matter. We are just conditioned to think they matter and so weexpend our energies and wind up our emotions worrying about things that othersprogramme us to believe are important. Are we too fat? Are we too thin? Are wetoo tall? Are we too small? Are our breasts big enough? Are our willies bigenough? Are we losing the hair on our heads? Do we have too much hair on ourbodies? Are we wearing the latest uniform (sorry fashion) that someone we havenever met has decided is “in”? We are deluged by advertisers and the television“programmes” funded by advertisers which tell us how we should be, look, andfeel. You’ve got a wrinkle on your face? Oh, my dear, your life is over. It’sthe end of the road. Unless, that is, you buy this super-duper face oil namedafter somewhere that sounds exotic. It will save your life. Hey, look at thiscurvy, sun-tanned, blonde we paid vast sums to show her bum on a beach. Buy ouroil and that could be you. (Author leaves word processor in order to vomit.)In Hollywood, the home of self and mass delusion, there are more face lifts andhair transplants per square mile than probably anywhere else on the planet. Itis no wonder. The Hollywood mentality is the ultimate illusion and it isobsessed with the physical senses. Its industry, its very reason for being, isbased on illusion, with false backdrops, false sunlight, and plastic, artificialemotions, as two actors who can’t stand each other come together for a warmcaress. My darling, I love you (cut!)... you asshole. Hollywood is a wonder toobserve and symbolises magnificently the illusions that keep the human mindenslaved. It sells to the mass psyche its version of history and of what isbeautiful, successful, and important. This invariably relates to archetypalimages of butch men with firm faces and plenty of hair (real or otherwise) andideally shaped women straight out of wardrobe and make up. Some actors know allthis isn’t real, but many forget to leave the illusions on the set. They livethem and take on that celluloid world as their reality. It is a world of fear,insincerity and insecurity: you were brilliant darling, what was I like? OhDorothy darling, I’m so glad you won the Oscar (lucky bitch). Their sense ofself comes not from what they are, but from how they are perceived by those whocontrol the illusion machine and by an audience conditioned by the illusionmachine. So plastic surgeons (why don’t they melt?) and hair transplanters havea licence to print money in this never-never-land. Yes folks, this is what youcan aspire to. These are the stars, the imagePicture #141 [images/img_0141.png]121of what you ought to be, but aren’t. Ainteha just so sad?A few questions for those who buy this idea that there is somehow an idealshape, height, weight, hairstyle, age or willy size. Who says? Who decided that?Did you decide that because it was your original thought or because that is whatyou have been conditioned to believe? The latter, almost certainly. What’s moreif your friends and family have been conditioned to believe the same (and mostof them have) you feel an even greater pressure to aspire to that manufacturedimage of physical perfection. I saw a documentary about Hollywood men in whichthis guy’s sex life had been destroyed by an operation that went wrong... anoperation to fill his willy with fat from another part of his body to make itlook bigger.Uhhhhhh! I know, I know, my eyes are watering too. My God, what’s happened tous? What happened to our infinity of understanding, Oneness and self love? Ithink it bought a movie ticket.Is it just me? I mean what does it matter if someone has a larger or smallerbody than the “ideal”. Does it make them a bad person? No. Does it make themless intelligent? No. Does it make them less able to give and receive love? No.So what does it make them, then, what’s the big deal? It makes them different tothe conditioned version of “normality”, that’s all. And what is this “norm”? Isit normal to be a suntanned blonde with a polished smile showing her bum to acamera? I’ve just come back from town and I didn’t see one of them anywhere. Iwould have noticed. I’m sure. All I saw were people of different shapes, coloursand sizes adding to the variety of life and experience. Not a bare bum or suntan in sight. And what’s this terror that men have of losing their hair? Oh mylife’s over, women won’t be attracted to me., save my hair, take it from myarmpits, anywhere, Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh ! !! Let’s just go through this again:when you lose your hair does it make you a bad person? No. Does it make you lessintelligent? No. Does it make you less able to give and receive love? No. What’smore, it doesn’t even make you different. Look around you, most men lose theirhair. And get this: what would be our reaction if we lived on a planet in whichthe physical body had no hair on its head and suddenly it started to grow? Oh mylife’s over, women won’t be attracted to me., remove my hair, stick it under myarmpits, anywhere, Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! Exactly. It’s just conditioning,that’s all it is.It’s a piece a shit, walk away.Picture #142 [images/img_0142.png]122The irony of all this, and the knowledge that will end the manipulation of humanemotions by the multibillion-dollar-hate-your-body industry, is that there is noneed for all these potions and creams and willy surgeons. Our bodies are areflection of our sense of self. They are a physical expression of our mind andemotions. You can see in the faces of people if they have been through extremeemotional pain. It is written in their features. People who eat a lot and createbigger bodies for themselves are invariably manifesting in their eating habitsan emotional torment of some kind. For them it’s food, for others its drink ordrugs, just a means to escape temporarily from the emotion they wish to shutout. Our minds control our bodies and our bodies will reflect our state of mind.I have a close friend who has an astonishing connection between mind and bodyHer whole face changes with her changing emotions. It’s remarkable to see. Thefaces of the mind-controlled human robots often change as they switch“personalities”. If we feel good about ourselves we will transmit the sameenergy to our bodies. If we feel unloved and unwanted, our bodies will manifestthat, also. The same goes for aging. We don’t have to age as we do. We expect toage because that is our reality and so we age. As we evolve towards Oneness, theaging process will slow down and we will live for what appears to us now to beincredible lengths of time. Impossible? Nothing, NOTHING, is impossible.Incidentally, returning to that Hollywood theme, those actors who fear losingtheir looks or their hair are far more likely to lose them. We attract to uswhat we most fear because overcoming fear is essential to our evolution. Relax.Whatever you are is OK. It’s your role in the movie at this moment. You are whatyou are and you can change what you are by changing what you think you are.That, too, applies to our bodies. Anyway, you chose your body before incarnationin the knowledge of what that would mean in terms of size, shape and length ofappendage. You did that for an experience that you believed would speed yourunderstanding and evolution. It is just a temporary body you are eternal mindand spirit. But if we get caught into the trap of accepting the manipulatorsversion of what is normal and “sexy”, we will have a lifetime of diminished selfworth if we don’t have a body that confomis to that.Fundamentally related to the desire for some physical “perfection” or “norm” isthe great myth that happiness can be pursued. The pursuit of happiness is evenpart of the United States Constitution and it is a system-serving device whichencourages people to run around like terrified chickens chasing something thatsimply cannot be caught.Picture #143 [images/img_0143.png]123People are duped into pursuing happiness with a bigger fridge, or the latestcar, or a bigger house. “If I just had this or that,” they say “I’d be happy.”But when they get it, they’re still not happy. Most people go through theirentire lives without being truely happy. Of course there may be moments whenthey feel blissful, but those moments are so fleeting. Their “happiness” isnormally measured by levels of uDhappiness. The harder you try to findhappiness, the more elusive it becomes. The reason is simple: if you are in aconstant state of pursuing happiness you can never be happy. Your “now”experience is always the pursuing of happiness, never happiness itself. Yourhappiness is always in the future and not in your now. Its like sitting on oneof those horses on the fairground rides. It doesn’t matter how fast the carouselis turning, you never get any closer to the horse in front. John Lemion oncewrote that life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans. Inthe same way, happiness is constantly passing us by because we are spending allour time pursuing it instead of “being” it. The only way to be happy is to behappy. That is a state of mind within your control whatever you are doing. Itdoesn’t require a new Ferrari or an extension to your dangly bits. Happiness isnot a pursuing, it is a being. The harder you chase it, the further you push itaway. It can be likened to chasing a butterfly. The more desperately you chargeat it, the more it will elude you. But if you stop trying so hard, lay down onthe grass and relax, there is a chance it will just come and land on yourshoulder. A similar example is the swimmer trying to reach a ball in the water.The harder and more desperately he swims, the more he disturbs the water and theball gets further and further away. If, however, he is patient and relaxes, hewill reach the ball using a lot less effort and emotion. We are called humanbeings and yet we have become human “doings”. We are conditioned to chaseeverything, including, most significantly happiness. This constant state ofpursuit obscures the truth that life is a lot easier than we are conditioned tobelieve and does not require the enormous expenditure of physical and emotionalenergy that we observe every-day. Instead of chasing our dreams, we can use ourmultidimensional powers to attract our dreams to us. Flowing with our intuitionis a great deal more effective than living our lives as if someone hadjustshouted “fire”.Another thing that hooks us in emotionally and seeps our energy for no goodreason is the way we are offended by what others say or do. People are offendedby different things because they are programmed by different Hassle-Free Zones(a religion, a political “ism”, what wePicture #144 [images/img_0144.png]124were told was “right and “wrong” by our parents). What offends one person won’toffend another because they will have been conditioned to be offended bydifferent things. Tell a Christian that Jesus was an asshole and they will bemortally offended. A Muslim will not. Tell the Muslim that Mohammed was anasshole and he’ll be offended, but not the Christian. It’s all in the mind.There are, however, some universal taboos which seem to offend vast numbers ofpeople of all beliefs because society as a whole, the main Hassle-Free Zone, hasdecided that we should be offended by them. So we are. We do as we are told likefully paid up robots. There may be some people reading this book who have beenoffended by my use of the word shit. If you have, it might be worth askingyourself why you are offended. Shit is merely the one syllable sound which hasbeen accepted to mean a substance we all produce and if we didn’t produce it wewould eventually explode. Very messy. I use the word shit because the nature ofthe substance it describes is brilliantly symbolic of the propaganda we arepressured to accept as our reality on this planet. If anyone is offended by theword shit, it is not because I am being offensive because that is not myintention. It is because you have chosen to be offended. It is all taking placein your mind, not mine. Even if I was trying to be offensive, you still don’thave to take it on and be affected by it. You have a choice. Well now I’veoffended you, I might as well go all the way In for a penny in for a pound - youknow me. How about the word fuck?My GOD! Did you hear what he just said?Youknow.. .ffff. ,.the”F”word.Disgusting! Outrageous! What an awful man!I said the “F” word? Oh, you mean fuck? Yes, that’s right, I did. So? It’s funnythat the same people who do not get offended by American warplanes bombing thecrap out of people in the Middle East, Vietnam, and elsewhere, killing childrenby the score, will be breathless in their indignation when someone says the word“fuck”. The end of the world is not ushered in by warplanes and atomic bombs,but by people saying “fuck”. “The moral fibre of society is crumbling. Bringback hanging and conscription, that’ll sort it. Put ‘em in the army, make bomberpilots of them.” What a hoot it is, all this plastic moral hypocrisy You have“news”papers selling themselves by using naked women and sexual titillation andthat’s OK, it seems. But when the word fuck comes into a story, it is alwayswritten as “f***” because this is a “family”Picture #145 [images/img_0145.png]125newspaper as you can see by the lady showing her tits on the inside page. What’swith this f* * * business? When you see f***, what word goes through your mind?Fuck, exactly So what’s the difference? Ah, I get it now. It’s fine to think theword fuck, but not to say it or write it in full. Gotcha. F*** that. See, itseasyGive me strength.I was thinking: what if the slang word for sexual intercourse had turned out tobe something else? It could quite easily have been so. We call two pieces ofbread placed together a sandwich because a guy called Sandwich was supposed tohave “invented” them. What if his name had been Willie? Or Sidebottom? We’d nowbe eating willies or sidebottoms. It’s just a word, a sound. What if the slangword for sexual intercourse had been, by a quirk of fate, sandwich? And what ifthe word for two pieces of bread placed together had turned out to be fuck?Today if you go into a sandwich bar and ask for a cheese and tomato sandwichno-one turns a hair. But if you ask for a fucking sandwich, everyone is mortallyoffended. Imagine if the words were the other way round, as could quite possiblyhave happened. You would then go into a fucking bar and ask for a cheese andtomato fuck. No-one would turn a hair. But if you asked for a sandwiching fuck,everyone would be mortally offended.My GOD! Did you hear what he just said?You know., .ssss.. .the “S \"word.Disgusting! Outrageous! What an awful man!I’ve got a great idea. Let’s grow up shall we?I’m not advocating that everyone goes around using the word fuck or any otherjust for the sake of it. I actually think the word is a travesty of the trueexperience of sexual union, which at its peak, with the right person at theright time, is for me, the ultimate experience in this timespace reality. But itis also a very expressive word which conveys brilliantly your state of mind whenyou drop a hammer on your foot, or the car won’t start, or the events of the dayhave wound you up. A few more “fucks” and tears and a few less stiff upper lipsand a lot of people would occupy their bodies for a great deal longer. Theoverall point I am making here, however, is that if you are offended at anythingandPicture #146 [images/img_0146.png]126have your emotions stressed as a result, it is you who have chosen to beoffended. It’s a thought form, a state of mind, which you are in control of.People constantly get offended and wound up about things that don’t matter. Justwhisper slowly ...f...u...c...k... There, are you any better or worse a person?No. You have just shaped your mouth and lips to say a word, just as you do whenyou say sandwich. It is just a sound. It is the intent behind a word, not theword itself, that is positive or negative.The way so many are offended by the sight of the naked human body never ceasesto make me chuckle. Religion has conditioned the collective psyche to such adegree that to display what we were born with, live with, and die with - ourphysical body - is considered highly offensive and an arrestable offence! It isillegal to show your willy or fuzzy bits on a beach, but legal to blow the shitout of defenceless people in faraway countries under the banner of freedom andpeace. To say our “values” have become desperately confused is theunderstatement of eternity. This is one reason why I decided to appear naked onthe front cover and even then I had to hide my doo dah with a sticker to allowthe book to be displayed in the shops. Bookshops, it seems, have been designateddoo dah-free zones. It’s just a body for Christ’s sake and we all have one. Ifyou are offended by a naked body again you might ask why you are offendedbecause that’s your choice, your problem, and no-one else’s. The same applieswhen people attack us or hurl abuse at us. We can take on their problem or leavethem to deal with it. If they have a problem with us, that’s exactly thesituation. They have a problem. It only becomes our problem if we choose to gethooked in and be offended by what they say or do. When we react negatively tosomeone who offends or hurts us, we are making a twoway magnetic connection withthem. We become hooked into their vibe. Their problem is now ours. We areplaying on their negative playing field, on their terms, and by their rules.When we choose not to be offended or hurt, there is no magnetic connection andso we don’t take on another’s problem or create a problem that isn’t reallythere. You don’t have to be offended, it’s up to you. But for those who areeasily offended I can only say:It’s a human waste product, walk away.Another irrelevance we take terribly seriously is the so called “education”system. It is nothing of the kind. It is an indoctrinationPicture #147 [images/img_0147.png]127system, a key form of mind-control. Its job is to mould our consciousness intothe shape of a four-legged animal from which we obtain wool. Teachers passthrough the indoctrination system and they go off to schools and universities toindoctrinate the next generation. At the peak of the “education” pyramid, thisis done knowingly but the overwhelming majority of teachers and lecturers arejust programmed people programming their students. It is a self-perpetuatingcycle. Those teachers who know they are caught in a web of indoctrination andconditioning only go so far in pointing this out because if they say what theyreally think they are out of a job. In the United Kingdom, we have a “NationalCurriculum” which insists that all children and students are the same, or mustbe made to be so. Everyone is taught the same subjects in basically the same wayand the measurement of success of both system and student is based on how adeptthey are at transferring mental garbage from mind to paper. Sorry how adept theyare at passing “exams”. The education system is the mind-mould production linefor the Hassle-Free Zone. The curriculum is, in its themes and at its core,merely the view of life and ourselves which the Elite and their manipnlators onthe Fourth Dimension wish us to have. Students are taught about politics as ifdemocracy was freedom and choice actually existed; they are taught that thefinancial system is sane and sensible and not an enormous sleight of hand; theyare told that this world is “real” and not just an illusion created by thought -their thoughts; they are conditioned for the world of “work” and a mind numbinglife of serving the system. One slave reporting for duty, sir! One mind for theuse and abuse of, sir! Atteeen-tion.A most powerful form of reality conditioning is what is called “history”. Whatis really meant by that term is the official version of history How we see thepast has a massive impact on how we see the present and the future. Officialhistory tells a story of black and white events in which the good guys fight thebad and win victories for “freedom”. Hiding what really happened in the past isessential for the manipulators if they are to hide what is happening now.Nowhere are students taught, or even asked to consider the possibility, that thesame people might have been manipulating and funding all “sides” to createdivide and rule, start wars, and change the nature of the post-war society. Eventhough this is provable, children and students all over the world continue to betold a very different, manufactured, story. Teachers are told this version istrue when they go through the system and they tell their students it is truewhen they become an indoctrinatorPicture #148 [images/img_0148.png]128(teacher) for the system. No-one has to intervene to directly manipulate schoolsand teachers once this structure is up and running. It runs itself. In the sameway all the knowledge about an alternative view of life, consciousness, healingand creation, are kept out of the classroom unless a rare, enlightened anddetermined teacher finds a way of introducing these subjects outside of theofficial curriculum. This curriculum is, in the UK and doubtless elsewhere, sopacked with “information” which the system insists must be taught that there isno time in the day for an alternative to its imposed reality. The educationsystem is about teaching and tuning minds to see only the world of physicalnessor some religious “afterlife” that involves doing as you are told to avoid beinghanded the coal shovel.But, and here’s the point I am making in this chapter, billions of people havebought the idea that passing exams set by the system for the perpetuation of thesystem is a measurement of a child’s or student’s success. Young people worryand sweat and have their lives blighted by the fear of not passing this or thatexam and getting the grades the system has decided confirms your level ofintelligence. Some youngsters even commit suicide if they fail to achieve thisand they feel incredible guilt at “letting down” their parents. My friends, ifyour parents are going to feel let down or think you are a failure because youhave failed to recall the trash the system was asking you to recite, theydeserve to be disappointed. It’ll do them good. It’s time they grew up. Forgoodness sake what is an “exam”? It is the system saying “tell me what I want tohear, otherwise you fail. Do as I say or you’ll be a loser, kid”. Exams areactually a measurement of how indoctrinated you are! Exams are a colossalirrelevance, except where they relate to a specific job or task. They don’tmatter. Your personal learning, your understanding of yourself and yourpotential, is what matters and the education/indoctrination system suppresses,not caresses, that understanding. You’re not a clone, you are an amazing beingof light and love with an astonishing uniqueness to express. What are you doingworrying about examinations set by a system which wants to condition you, cloneyou and crush your sense of uniqueness?It’s a piece a shit, walk away.Still today, despite all the evidence from past and present, people continue toargue about party politics, even though the same Elite has funded andmanipulated virtually every major party in the world intoPicture #149 [images/img_0149.png]129existence. People turn out at the mass rallies waving their party flags,clapping and cheering as dictated by the spin doctors playing to the cameras,and then off trot their heroes to Downing Street, the White House or wherever,to pursue policies that are a virtual mirror-image of the “opponents” theyreplaced. What we call “democracies” are merely One Party States with the sameforce, a Global Elite, either controlling directly, or dictating by events, thedecisions of presidents and prime ministers who only appear to be in charge.They are not. They are puppets. Look at the background, for instance, to BillClinton and George Bush and you see that they are members of the sameorganisations and controlled by the same clique.1 Yet they appear to beopponents with one proclaiming to be a “Democrat” and the other a “Republican”.Again, it’s an illusion, some more special effects to dupe the audience watchingthe movie. We have to think we have choice otherwise we might realise we live ina dictatorship that is only decked out to look like freedom.In many ways I feel for politicians. They are pawns being moved around the boardby manipulation and events until they no longer know their arse from theirelbow. They become so focussed on the dream of power that they have no idea whatthey really think or stand for - if anything. The pursuit of power becomes thesole decider of policy and “opinion”. It is policy by yesterday’s headlines orthe latest, manipulated opinion poll - both of which are dictated by the Elite.In truth, politicians, even presidents and prime ministers, have no real power.They are at the mercy of events controlled by those much higher up the pyramid,those who manipulate public opinion - the very opinion the politicians seek topander to at election time. This means that all their “policies” and attitudesare basically the same (the One Party State), and this has turned politics intoa sickening farce in which insults are preferred to insight and discord todebate. Twice a week in the House of Commons in London, the Prime Minister hostssomething known as Question Time when he or she is questioned by the leader ofthe opposition. I will give you a flavour:Opposition Leader: “Will the Prime Munster please explain why his government isthe most useless, unfair administration, in the history of this parliament, andwhy he is such a jerk, incapable of running a whelk stall on Camden market?”1 See ... and the truth shall setyoafree.Picture #150 [images/img_0150.png]130(Sits down amid loud cheers from fellow party members who are waving bits ofpaper and shouting silly yah boo remarks.)Prime Minister: “What hypocrisy for that to come from the most useless,talentless opposition party in the history of this parliament, led by a man whois such a jerk that he couldn ’t run afish and chip shop on Brighton sea front.”(Sits down amid loud cheers from his fellow party members who are waving bits ofpaper and shouting silly yah boo, remarks)I don’t claim that to be verbatim, but you get my drift. Two people tradeinsults and it is seen as a virility contest for which one is best equipped torun the country I thought the Prime Minister looked more authoritative and incontrol today you know. The way he said “You’re just a lily-livered berk” rightat the end was a master stroke of timing. He’ll win some points in the ratingsfor that! Often these mutual insults are the lead story on the television newsthat night:(Fade loud, ominous music, and cue stern, concerned looking newsreader withstem, concerned sounding voice): “The Prime Minister and the Leader of theOpposition clashed in the Commons today over which one was the biggest jerk. Areport coming up.”ZZZzzzzzzzz!No, wake up. We’re supposed to take this seriously We are supposed to ponderlong and hard over which one we will vote for as the next puppet of the globaldictators and the manipulators on the Fourth Dimension. Come on, this isserious. We can’t just ignore elections because we know that whoever mns forpresident on both “sides” is funded, controlled and selected by the same cliquewho use the media, which they also control, to make sure the guy they reallywant wins. How can we call ourselves free if we don’t use our vote to decidewhich of these guys will be the next puppet of the Elite? My pappy died fightingfor the right to vote, y’hear? You can’t ignore “free” elections. No? I beg todiffer.We will only loosen the weights on our consciousness and rise towards Onenesswhen we let go of the irrelevant diversions that take our eyes off the ball. Itdoesn’t matter which party is in the White House or which one has a majority inCongress or the House of Commons, orPicture #151 [images/img_0151.png]131any other parliament. It’s all a con, anyway They are all of the same basicmentality, oppo-sames playing the game, a game which ignores who and what wereally are and the solutions that come from, and only come from, that knowledge.The party political system, like the financial system, is going to collapsebecause its structure is a physical expression of the old global energy field,the old imagination that humanity has had of itself. To support this system anylonger by voting at rigged elections (also known as democracy) is to give it anenergy which will prolong its death and the human prison it underpins. It iswasting energy which could be used to create another reality to replace the old.Let it die, its day is gone. We are growing up now. As the spiritualtransformation gathers pace and the sense of human reality changes, the oldstructures of party politics and interest-bearing debt are being thought out ofexistence. This will manifest on the physical level as people losing confidencein the system, refusing to play by its rales, and the edifice of control will bedenied the power (our power) which it needs to survive. It is already sprintingto stand still, or rather chasing its own tail. The time is approaching when itwill disappear up its own backside, like some giant black hole, never to be seenagain. Halleluyaaaah. How quickly that happens depends on how quickly wewithdraw our energy from it and stop taking seriously the sight of boys andgirls playing silly little games while trying to look important. Politics is anillusion of freedom, it is imposition parading as choice, and it only survivesbecause we give it our energy by playing the dummy at the one party ballot box.Those who get to the top in politics are the least qualified people for the jobbecause of what they need to do, and the attitudes they need to have, to reachthe summit of the greasy pole.In 1996 Bill Clinton said he supported a curfew for children and young people upto the age of 17. This was, he said, to reduce juvenile crime(problem-reaction-solution). In fact it was a stepping stone to the much wideruse of the curfew (control) in the adult population. Juvenile crime is obviQuslynot desirable, but it pales in the face of the violence and crime created andperpetrated by politicians and those who control them. A 16-year-old breakinginto a house is deeply unpleasant for those involved, of course. It hardlycompares, however, with the murder and maiming of thousands of people by US andNATO aircraft, or the death and misery of billions in the Third World caused byabuse and manipulation by governments in the “west”. Therefore if curfews aresuch an effective response to violence and crime, it is only rightPicture #152 [images/img_0152.png]132that we should have them for the President of the United States and hisequivalents across the planet. If they spent their days tidying their rooms anddoing their homework, the world would be a much safer place. Amazingly, that isactually true! Party politics should carry a health warning: Danger, not to betaken seriouslyIt’s a piece a shit, walk away.Two other areas I would raise in this context are economics and the media. Wecan get seriously hooked into sterile, diversionary, debates about economics andmoney Economists are wheeled on nightly to tell us how important some irrelevantfinancial development is to our lives and why this or that must happen tocompensate. It usually involves bigger taxation, holding down wages, or higherprices. We then worry about money and attract what we fear. It is a viciouscircle. We have a “can’t do” economic system which reflects the system as awhole. It’s designed as a prison. By “can’t do” I mean that anything that reallyneeds doing to fundamentally improve life on Earth cannot be done, according tothe mind doctors, because of its effect on “economic stability” - in other wordsit doesn’t suit the Global Elite and their controllers on the Fourth Dimension.“I know what you suggest would help people,” they say “but look at the effect oninflation or the public sector borrowing requirement”. You name it and thesystem will offer you a long word to justify why it can’t be done. There isnothing we can’t do. It is only that we choose not to do it and because theeconomic system is designed to prevent positive change. It is a prison becauseit is meant to be a prison. We have people in need and people who have theskills to help them, but the rigidity of the economic (Elite-created) structureseeks to stop the two getting together. When they tell you that something can’tbe done because it would harm the economy, they are lying to you or betrayingtheir own misunderstanding of what is going on. Economic-speak seeks to confuseus and diminish us because we don’t understand the Tanguage and what seems to besuch a complex web of figures and data. In fact, it’s dead simple. You lendpeople money that doesn’t exist and charge them interest on it. Everything overand above that is a smoke-screen which is built on the foundations of lendingpeople money that doesn’t exist and charging interest on it. Without that globalconjuring trick, it all comes tumbling down. And yet when we hear predictionsthat this system will collapse there is enormous fear among those who areenslaved by it. I can understandPicture #153 [images/img_0153.png]133that, given the way we are conditioned. But why are we desperately trying toshore up the walls of our own prison? Let it go, the quicker the better, andthen we can create a system of interest-free money and exchange that is based onabundance for all, and not, as today, on manufactured scarcity which leads todependency - control. If we think abundance, there will be abundance.Everything is made from energy and energy is infinite. There is no shortage ofanything. Scarcity only comes when we accept the conditioning that life is aboutstraggle, scarcity, and mere survival. Again, if that is our imagination ofourselves and the world, there will be scarcity but we can just as easily createabundance. There is nothing to fear about the imminent collapse of the globalfinancial prison. There’s no need to waste your energy and emotions worryingabout the consequences. You will always have whatever you need if that is yourimagination of yourself. And there’s no need to divert your attention from yourmultidimensional self by getting caught up in economic “debate” and argumentabout the best way to resuscitate a dinosaur. Trying to stop the collapse ofthis economic insanity would be like rearranging the deckchairs on a sinkingTitanic. A waste of time and energy. Much more sensible to climb in a lifeboat.This is your sinking prison we are talking about and it’s falling apart. Whyaren’t we rejoicing instead of searching for the glue? The economic structure isgoing to fall anyway because the energy field or “matrix” which created thestructure is imploding with changing human consciousness and the energies nowencircling this dimension. The economic system which we see as our security isreally a ball and chain. Let it go. Think it out of existence.It’s a piece a shit, walk away.I guess nothing powers the light at the bottom of the bottle more than theglobal media. I worked in newspapers, radio and television for many years and Ican honestly say that in all that time I never had a single conversation with afellow journalist that was not related to the version of life promoted by theHassle-Free Zone. I cannot recall those daily conversations producing oneoriginal thought. There are few more programmed, conditioned professions thanthe media. And yet it is this myopic mentality which writes and edits the “news”that you read and hear every day! You don’t have to control every journalistpersonally to force them to publish the Elite version of “truth”. It’s mucheasierPicture #154 [images/img_0154.png]134than that. You create the mentality and perspective from which the media seesthe world and from that point the manipulation virtually runs itself. Forinstance, the media judges everything from the perspective of the status quo,the “norm” accepted as reality within the Flassle-Free Zone. Whoever decideswhat that “norm” shall be at any point, effectively decides how the media willreport the world. The status quo - the accepted norm - a few centuries ago wasthat the Earth was flat. Today’s media, in line with the “scientific” andreligious status quo at that time, would have ridiculed or condemned anyone whodared to suggest it was round. But once the evidence became so overwhelming thatthe status quo reality had to change, suddenly it was those who said the Earthwas flat who were laughed at. So it is with the modern media and this is whyanyone who challenges the fundamentals of the accepted “norm” is immediatelyjumped upon by the media monster. In effect, the media is the police force ofthe HassleFree Zone. It frightens people into conforming to imposed norms.Meeting so many mainstream journalists and seeing their attitudes to life hasserved to confirm this to me more times than I care to recall. That is not tocondemn them as people. They, like all of us, are incredible beings of light intheir multidimensional form. But, in my view, they have switched off theirmultidimensional self and chosen to work on a fraction of their potential tounderstand and “see”. This makes them a manipulator’s dream and the idealmentality for a journalist within a system designed to control and misinform.The media is part of the game and reports the players in the game without everquestioning the game itself. The “big name correspondents and news presentersare nothing more than sports reporters. They report a different game, that’sall. They report on the ups and downs of teams in the game, the politicalparties, the banks and the financial exchanges, and they interview themanagers,’ the players and the pundits. They call this “reporting” or“investigative journalism”, but it only “investigates” those areas which willnot expose the game itself as the reason for our global plight. They neverquestion the game because the media is part of the game and owned by the game.It is fundamental to the game. Any journalist who sought to really expose thegame as rotten to the core or, God forbid, that it is controlled by a relativehandful of people, none of which are ever elected, would be looking for anotherjob. If anyone tried to explain that we create our own reality and that we livein a virtual reality vortex, they would be clearing their desk with arecommendation that they see a shrink. The mental andPicture #155 [images/img_0155.png]135emotional divide between the view of life expressed in this book and the mediamentality is not only a chasm, it’s a universe. The media is another example ofoppo-sames promoted as choice and diversity. The only real difference betweenthe so called “radical”, “intellectual” London Guardian and the tits and bumsLondon tabloid called The Sun is the size of the paper, the length of thestories, and the approach they use to defend the status quo. Oh yes, theGuardian and its like around the world will pontificate about poverty andfreedom and criticise players and teams in the game. But on the foundations thatshore up the game it is at one with The Sun. They are status quo protectionsheets.The same goes for the BBC, an organisation I used to work for. It sticks itsnose in the air and talks of pursuing truth, but it is really just another armof the Global Elite’s propaganda network. In December 1995, the BBC produced a“Review of the Year” in which the “reporter” proceeded to tell the story of theyear according to the official version of events. One section talked of the“enemy within” and opportioned blame for the Oklahoma bombing and the Japanunderground gas attack to groups and individuals who had yet to even standtrial! They simply took the government line of what had happened and who was toblame. No other view was reported. When I wrote to the Director General of theBBC asking how this could be justified, there was no denial of the points Imade, only that the whole story could not be told due to pressure of time. Thatwas a nonsense because in the time they gave to these items a balanced picturecould have been reported. But here we had the BBC, this so called legendarybroadcasting network, unable to deny that they gave only one version of events -the official one. The same is happening in newspapers and on radio andtelevision stafl 0 us the world over every day with all the television networkslike NBC, CBS and ABC in the United States owned by the Global Elite, as is theglobal cable news network, CNN. It is called news, but it is propaganda,designed at source to manipulate the mass consciousness. Only a comparativelyfew journalists knowingly manipulate. Most of those who report this propagandaare duped into thinking it is news and truth. The media is the myopic leadingthe partially sighted.But again, how often we allow ourselves to be sucked in by manufactured andmeaningless debates stimulated by news items designed to manipulate our view ofourselves and others. And we judge people and events on the basis of informationpresented to us by thisPicture #156 [images/img_0156.png]136controlled, closed minded naivete, we call the media. It’s lying to you minuteby minute, day after day and yet those lies are used by people to condemn andridicule others and pressure them to conform to the limitations of theHassle-Free Zone. “It must be true, I read it in the paper and saw it on thenews.” (In that case it is probably not true.) “No, no, all the papers andtelevision stations are saying it.” (In that case, it’s definitely not true). Iobserve the media because it is a major player in the game, but I don’t believea single word it says unless it is confirmed by other independent sources. Ifthe media in general wants us to believe something it is because those whomanipulate the world want us to believe it. Those who manipulate the worldcontrol the media and the global news agencies that provide much of itsinformation. The news programmes tell us what to think and the mental cancer ofgame shows and soaps urge us not to think. It is a telling combination and ithas created a resident hypnotist in the homes of billions of people. It may becalled a television and what it spews out may be called news and entertainment.But it is really a hypnotist whispering its thought control. It is after yourmind and its mantra messages tell us what we should think, be, and do. Of allthe elements that make up that light at the foot of the bottle, the media, andespecially television, are among the brightest and most seductive...Listen to meeeee. Look into my screeeeen. This is realiteeeee. Shut downyour psycheeeee. You are freeeee.It’s a piece a shit, walk away.You can find diversions everywhere to lead us away from the simplicity ofunderstanding. The so called New Age movement has done some excellent work inoffering people alternatives to the system’s view of life, but it, too, isbecoming a prison of the mind. Across the New Age you find endless pseudo-gurussetting themselves up as “teachers”. It is good that people are beginning tospeak out and offer a new vision as long as they don’t become another crutch forthose who follow them. Giving your mind away to some New Age “teacher” is nodifferent to handing it over to a priest, politician or economist. Surely we arelooking to take back our responsibility, not find a new home for it. Yet so manypeople I meet who talk of the need to think and feel for ourselves, still lookto someone else for answers. They move from guru to guru, teacher to teacher,seeking the veryPicture #157 [images/img_0157.png]137enlightenment that has been there within themselves all along. You don’t need tofind an “enlightened one” to tell you what to think - you are an enlightenedone. We ah are. We’ve simply forgotten and switched off our connection to thatenlightenment. Listening to all views, including those of the New Age“teachers”, is a good thing if we filter their information and take from it whatwe believe is right while leaving the rest. The danger comes when people takeeverything that someone says and, in effect, take on another’s belief system infull. I have found quite an arrogance among some in the New Age who insist thatwhat they say must be accepted by ah of us. There is even a New Age fashionwhich is nothing more than the uniform you find within other areas of thesystem. For me, the New Age has become bogged down with irrelevant ceremony,jargon, and bullshit masquerading as enlightenment. People give their power awayto Ashtar Commands and Maitreyas and a stream of other “masters”, so ignoringthe real master within. This is an example of how the pendulum or the scalesswing from one extreme to the other before settling down to balance. I feel alsothat the same Fourth Dimensional manipulators who created the religions, partypolitics and the global financial system, are manipulating parts of the New Ageand it is a warning of how the same old hierarchical structures can be dressedup as new. I have great sympathy with the view that the New Age movement isplanned to evolve into the World Religion, another global centralisation andimposition on the Elite’s agenda. There is a consciousness that has moved beyondthe New Age which has accepted the themes of reincarnation and the eternal,multidimensional nature of consciousness, but has rejected the complicatedexplanations and the New Age-speak. It has seen the simplicity of everything andrealises that much of the New Age is’ another diversion from that simplicity. Ifeel we need to be constantly selective and allow our own intuition to make thatselection. There is a great deal in the New Age which is highly commendable andmakes an important contribution to the awakening of the human heart and mind.But there is even more in New Age dogma to which the following would be highlyapplicable:It’s a piece a shit, walk away.When I use the term “walk away”, I don’t mean that we should never pamper ourbodies, observe the political scene, go to a school, listen to the view of NewAge “teachers”, or use the financial system as it standsPicture #158 [images/img_0158.png]138today I would not dream of telling you what to do, that’s up to you and no-oneelse. The thoughts in this book are mine, an expression of my reality. Theydon’t have to be yours. By “walk away”, I mean to walk away mentally andemotionally If you know the media is lying to you and seeking to manipulate yourthoughts, you watch the television or read a newspaper from that detachedperspective. You don’t get fooled into taking it seriously or seeing it asimportant or true. You know what the game is and you’re not playing. The samewith “education”. You can go to school, enjoy the parts that stimulate you andaccept the information that feels right to you, but still walk away mentally andemotionally from all the rest. You know it’s an indoctrination machine, so youcan observe it in the knowledge of what it is seeking to do. You can filtereverything you are told and not be indoctrinated. You take control of what youabsorb and accept, not the system. You can also see exams for what they are andrefuse to be emotionally affected by how the system judges you in that way Itdoesn’t matter. My boy Gareth is coming towards the end of his school life, buthe is not indoctrinated. He has taken the information that feels right andrejected the rest because he knows that schools and universities are primarilythere to condition, not to inform.I use the money system at the moment to live, travel, and do my work. But I knowit is all a big illusion, a joke. You take away its power by not taking itseriously or seeing it as “real”. The money system is hilarious. The moment youlet go of the fear of being without the means to provide warmth, food, shelterand clothing, the system loses its grip on your psyche and you cease to feed itwith your energy, your power. What’s more when you lose the fear of beingwithout, you will always have what you need. Once the twin emotions of fearingthe financial system and seeing it as important and real are removed, thestructure will naturally collapse because its energy source is gone. In themeantime, we can use it as necessary, without taking on its fear and “values”.We take control of it, not it of us. Again, if you want to have a hairtransplant, wear a wig, or have your face lifted, fine. So what? Good luck toyou. But who is making that decision? Is it society instilling fear andpressuring you to conform to “norms” or do you genuinely want to control the wayyou look because you, and only you, have decided that’s the way you want to be?You want to lose weight? Fine, good luck to you. But who is deciding that? Issociety telling you to conform to the “norm” or have you, and only you, decidedthat’s how you want to look?Picture #159 [images/img_0159.png]139This is what I mean by walking away Detaching emotionally and making our owndecisions from our own values and delinking from manufactured diversions thatkeep us in the spiritual dark and imprisoned in the illusions of physicalness. Irepeat: most of the things that cause us emotional pain, occupy our attentionand demolish our self esteem, simply don’t matter. We are only told they matterbecause that will keep us captivated by physical illusion and delinked from ourinfinite self. Here’s a little exercise. First remember that you are an infiniteaspect of eternal consciousness on an endless journey of evolution and thatother levels of you are playing different roles in the movie on other screens(dimensions) in the cinema. You are not just a body, you are consciousnessexperiencing various situations and emotions to speed your return to Oneness.Right, keep that in mind and take a deep breath. Now take another look atwhatever it is that is screwing you up at the moment, be it a relationship, yourbody fear of the future, whatever.See what I mean?It’s a piece a shit, walk away.Picture #160 [images/img_0160.png]140Chapter 8I Love MeWhat’s that you say? I love me? What are you, some kind of egomaniac? Who do youthink you are, for goodness sake? You need taking down a peg or two my lad orlady.You’re not supposed to say you love yourself. You are supposed to be humble andkeep putting yourself down. Then people won’t feel threatened by you or beforced to face their own self-imposed limitations. You tell me yourinadequacies. I’ll tell you mine, we’ll both agree on how self-righteouslyhumble we are and then go back to sleep. ZZZzzzzzzzz. It’s not yourself youshould be loving, it is others -the world. That’s the street cred approach. Youtell people how humble you are and that your desire is to love the world. Oh,what a lovely man. He’s ever so humble, always putting himself down, and heloves everyone.No he doesn’t. He doesn’t love everyone because he doesn’t love himself. And ifhe doesn’t love himself he doesn’t love anyone.How can we give out from within what we do not have within? Love, true love init’s widest sense, does not discriminate. It doesn’t say I love this person, butnot that one. It just loves. Sure, people can feel what they think is love inthe narrow view of that word on Planet Earth. They can say they love theirpartner or children and they can feel a powerful bond with them. But they can’tfeel true love - cosmic love, you might say - until they feel cosmic love forthemselves. What you don’t have within, you can’t give without. And continuingthe theme of creating your own reality, if you don’t love yourself in thattotal, unconditional way you will attract to you people who will see you in thesame light. They won’t love you unconditionally until you love yourselfunconditionally They will go on saying I love you as long as you conform to whatI think you should be. That’s not love, it’s possession and manipulation,dressed up as love. How many of us truly love another to the extent that wewould support them and love themPicture #161 [images/img_0161.png]141in whatever they need to do for their own learning and evolution? If what theyfeel they need to experience or what events lead them to experience happens toconflict with our view of what they should be and do, our “love” for them canstart to ran very thin. You can’t be you if you want my “love”. You have to bewhat I want you to be. That’s the deal, isn’t it? Welcome to my jail, lover,give us a kiss. We have the same conditional attitude to loving ourselves. If wefollow our hearts, that intuitive energy that expresses our uniqueness, we feelguilty and diminished when others react against us or appear hurt by ouractions. But if we don’t love ourselves and respect our right to be who we are,how can we expect others to love us for what we are? Self love is that balancepoint when we allow ourselves the freedom from fear and guilt to be who and whatwe are. In turn, tme love for others is to allow them, without resentment andjudgement, to be who they are, even if it differs from what we would like themto be. I love you because you are. I love me because I am. Now that’s love.When I look back at my life I can see so clearly how my journey towards selflove has been mirrored in my physical experience. For the first 42 years Ididn’t think much of myself at all. I was the classic angry man, my temperalways simmering just below the surface as my frustrations at the world I sawaround me bubbled like some steaming cauldron in my psyche. I didn’t like me andI didn’t like the world. Planet Earth was a shitty place, populated by too manyshitty people. This was a replica of how I saw myself. I lived life on anemotional knife edge, wishing to love, but so often feeling only anger and“pity” which I believed, quite wrongly to be an expression of love. Thatattracted into my life many people who mirrored back at me what was going oninside. My life was a stream of angry confrontations with people, bom of my owninner anger. I wasn’t angry with them, in truth, I was angry with myself andthey were the means through which I could express that anger outwardly insteadof dealing with the source within me. After my spiritual alarm clock went off atthe start of the 1990s, I began, slowly at first and then at great speed, to seemyself in a very different light. For the first time in this incarnation, Istarted to like myself. Crikey, call the police. That’s a crime, isn’t it? It’snot a case of looking in the mirror, brushing the eyebrows, and saying “Oooh,I’m a bit of alright”, although there’s nothing wrong with that, either. It wasmore that I began to respect who I was and what I was seeking to achieve. Iliked being me. I didn’t want to be anyone else. As this evolved into a muchwider appreciation of love - a never endingPicture #162 [images/img_0162.png]142journey - my whole sense of self was transformed. I saw the areas I needed toface and work on because, as always, they were manifesting before my eyes in thepeople and experiences I attracted. But I knew who I was - an ever evolvingconsciousness which, at its core, in its natural state of being, is love, purelove, an aspect of the Source of All That Is. So are you. We all are. I began tosee that whatever I was doing at any time, whatever I was experiencing orhelping others to experience, was what I needed to do at that moment to facemyself, help others face themselves, and so gain greater insight andunderstanding. When my sense of self changed, the people I attracted into mylife changed also. The angry confrontations with others (myself) began tosubside and along came people who loved me for what I am, not for what they wishme to be. I stopped trying to be what I thought others wanted me to be - themask - and I have found peace with what I am, a unique aspect of God making aunique contribution to the human tapestry of experience. I have changed my senseof inner reality and therefore I have changed my physical reality. I havestarted to love myself and that is mirrored by others back to me in return.What’s more, as I have loved myself unconditionally, I have found it easier tolove others without condition. One person in particular has challenged me inthis area of unconditional love and, as a result, helped me to travel furtheralong that road. Feeling these powerful emotions in my life like anger, fear,guilt, resentment, and a lack of self worth, has been vital to what I am doingnow. My lifeplan is very simple: experience, leam, communicate. I couldn’t writethese books unless I had lived and felt so deeply the emotions I am writingabout. Nothing happens to us by accident. All happens for a reason, although itmay be only years later that we realise why There is so much conflict in theouter world that we see on the television news because there is so much innerconflict within people. The physical world reflects exactly what is going onwithin the human psyche. The inner turmoil and conflict creates its outerreflection everything from a family row to muggings, rape, terrorism and war.Conflict will only end in the outer world when we find peace within our innerworld - our consciousness. There will be peace and love on Earth when there ispeace and love in our hearts. And that begins and ends with self. When we loveand respect ourselves, we will create a personal - and together, a collective -reality that will mirror that inner love and harmony as an outer love andharmony We will have thought and felt into being a new heaven and a new Earth.Not one gun willPicture #163 [images/img_0163.png]143have been fired, not one new political “ism” established, and there will not bean economist or banker in sight. It doesn’t need new economic systems orparliamentary legislation to change the world. They only reflect the world as itis. All we need to do is change ourselves and everything will flow from that.Heal yourself and you heal the world.But is it any surprise that we have such a lack of love and respect forourselves and why we find it so difficult to find the inner peace that willbring heaven to the Earth? From the time we are small children we are beingconditioned to judge ourselves harshly and to think of ourselves in negativeterms. We are being told what we should be, how we should be, what is right andwrong, sane and insane, good and bad. Our self esteem and our sense ofuniqueness are conditioned out of us under the onslaught of messages invadingour psyche from programmed parents, priests, teachers, journalists, politiciansand bankers. This is how we think you should think and if you don’t conform wewill brand you ... naughty, lazy stupid, mad, bad, a disruptive influence, adanger to society a sinner, or a threat to the economic stability of the world.You get back in that sheep pen, y’hear? Woof, woof, woof. Be a clone, yourcountry needs clones. What do you think you are, unique? My God, if we let youget away with having your own mind, where will it end? They’ll all want to doit.The foundations of our subservience and lack of self esteem were built a longtime ago. Most consciousness in the world today has been caught in a cycle ofincarnation and reincarnation., physical life, followed by a return to thenon-physical realms - “death” - and then reincarnation into a physical body. Inthis way, we have all had experience in different cultures, colours, creeds andlife situations on the journey of learning through experience. This makes racismridiculous. And as we attract to us what we need to find balance and return toOneness, the racists of today will be the racially persecuted of tomorrow. Weget what we give out until we leam and evolve. We have all been men and women inour various incarnations because consciousness, in its harmonious state, is abalance of male and female. Each of the planes of existence within the virtualreality pyramid/ vortex has a physical and non physical level. You could seethis as a sort of hour-glass shape (Figure 7 overleaf) with the realms of thespirit at the top and the dense physical world below. The narrow tube, the“gate” between the two levels, is a neutral point where the vibrationalfrequency of the spiritual merges with the physical. It’s like a black hole.This is represented as the tunnel with a light at the end whichPicture #164 [images/img_0164.png]144The Spiritual “Hour-glass”/ \\/ Spiritual \\realms ofconsciousness\\ / \\ /The vibrational/ \\*• iicuiicti puinithe “tunnel\"The dense \\ physical 1\\ world /\\ /Each time/space dimension has physical and spiritual levels.These can be likened symbolically to an hourglass or egg-timer.When a physical life is over, our consciousness returns through the “tunnel” tothe realms of spirit.Figure 7millions of people have described after a near death experience. When people“die” and leave the physical body they do not necessarily move on toenlightenment. Death is no cure for ignorance. Consciousness continues to createits own reality Many psychics have made contact with departed “souls” who arestill floating in a limbo land of their own creation waiting for God to judgethem, so programmed is their psyche to believe that will happen. If suchconfused souls are listening, I’ve got some good news for you. The priest wasspinning you a yam. God isn’t coming to judge you, gang. God doesn’t judgeanyone. Pure love (the Source) doesn’t understand judgment. He/She onlyunderstands love. So find that tunnel and get out of here! What we often call aghost is consciousness that is so confused or mesmerised by the physical worldand its conditioned sense of reality that it does not returnPicture #165 [images/img_0165.png]Picture #166 [images/img_0166.png]Picture #167 [images/img_0167.png]145through the “tunnel” to the realms of spirit. Some of the more imbalanced ofthem have manifested as the “demons” of legend. But these lost souls are not tobe feared, they are just confused minds.The point I am emphasising here is that our consciousness has experienced a longstream of physical lives in many different circumstances on the journey ofevolution and at the point of “death” our psyche departs with all its knowledge,misunderstandings, and emotional debris. When you look back through known humanhistory it is a story of people (inspired from the Fourth Dimension I would say)using fear and violence to impose their version of life on the masses. Religionplayed the major role in this to the point where nonbelievers were burned. Theimpact on the evolving psyche of this constant pressure to conform and do as itwas told - or else - has conditioned humanity over scores of Earth-lives tosubmit to a perceived “authority”. Today, the human race is so easy to herd intothe pen because it has been in the pen before; life after life. It is not justone lifetime of conditioning that we are addressing here - it is thousands ofyears of them. When I talk of letting go conditioned responses, I am talkingabout attitudes and fears ingrained over vast periods of what we call time. Theintense fear of expressing our uniqueness is not the result of only this lifeexperience. It results from the sum total of our human experience, includingthose times when to say what you really believed was tantamount to a deathsentence, as indeed it still is for many people. When we have intense fears andphobias that have no “rational” explanation, it is events in this life, oftenquite innocuous events on the face of it, trigg&ring memories of deep emotionaltrauma caused by a past life experience. We need to be kind to ourselves. It’sbeen a tough journey through this dense physical world, but now we have a goldenchance to complete it.Also, the misunderstandings and manipulation of the three dimensional world haveturned experience, without which we could not evolve, into a nightmare ofresentment, guilt and recrimination. Not only that, with each Earth “life”, theunresolved, unbalanced, emotions are carried over in the psyche to the next one.So by now, the human subconscious is a sewer of unresolved emotional turmoilwhich must be released if we are to achieve the vibrational leap that the Earthis currently embarked upon, the quantum jump to a whole new state ofconsciousness. These emotions are the weights on the feet of the diver whichstops him naturally floating upwards to the surface. For many they are more likea collar around the neck connected to ropes hookedPicture #168 [images/img_0168.png]146into concrete, so all consuming are the angers, resentments, fears, and guiltswhich have resulted from previous experience over many lives on Earth (Figure8). We will never release our psyche from its dense physical prison until werelease ourselves from our emotional prison. The two are actually the samething. It is vital to understand this because as we get closer to the bigswitch, the quantum jump, our inner self will be attracting to us more and moreexperiences to give us the opportunity to face our emotional turmoil and releaseit. This is already happening to vast numbers of people. Their status quo, theirfalse sense of personal security, is being challenged by business collapse, lossof employment, the break up of long term relationships, and so on. If we have afalse sense of programmed security, that will come under challenge from eventsthat we, repeat we, are attracting to us. On the face of it, from the physicalperspective, these seem to be very negative events and I can understand that.But we are not physical bodies at our core, we are timeless, eternal, evolvingconsciousness and these experiences and challenges are designed to help us reachthe vibrational state that can make the jump from physical prison to spiritualfreedom.If we don’t see our experiences in this light, the release of such longtime, bigtime, emotional trauma could turn the world into a swirling sea of turmoil andconflict in the transition period that has been winding itself up for many yearsand is now entering its critical stage. It doesn’t have to be like that if wetake a step back and view our emotions and our interaction with others from amuch wider perspective. Using the movie example again, we need to get off thescreen more often and into the audience. I’ll explain what I mean. The build upof emotional baggage through each Earth-life experience into what is by now anexplosive mass of negativity, is the result of believing that this world isreal. It is not. It is a three-dimensional, virtual reality, holographic, moviescreen designed to provide us with the opportunity to experience the separationof Oneness as an aid to our further exploration of ourselves. We have also beenunder the illusion that we are separate. We are not. We are all aspects of Oneconsciousness, God, experiencing itself subjectively through its constituentparts - all of us. In truth, one actor is playing all the parts and sometimesthis actor kicks the crap out of itself. Imagine standing in front of the mirrorshouting abuse at yourself or hitting yourself around the head with a baseballbat. Only a madman would do that? The last time you screamed abuse or wereviolent to someone, you were actually doing it to yourself! ThePicture #169 [images/img_0169.png]Figure 8: Without the weights of negative emotion, we have the freedom to fly.Picture #170 [images/img_0170.png]Picture #171 [images/img_0171.png]148separation of Oneness in the dense physical world has been so challenging, thatwe have forgotten that it’s a movie. This separation has manifested in theseparation of humanity into different relationships, groups, beliefs andlifestyles, each seeking to impose their version of right and wrong on everyone.Once you stop respecting your own right to be you, whatever you may be, and youstop respecting everyone’s right to be them, the circumstances are there foremotional warfare to unfold on the personal and collective level. You have inneremotional turmoil because you are suppressing who you really are and submitting,through fear, to another’s design; and/or you are seething with anger andresentment with people who won’t live their lives as you believe they should.There are two main types of people, it seems to me. Those in the movie and thosein the audience. The most effective approach, I would suggest, is to keepswitching between the two. Then you enjoy both perspectives. Those stuckentirely in the movie (the overwhelming majority) believe that the movie isreal. Learning experiences become enormous emotional catastrophes and the guiltand resentment this produces is held throughout that lifetime and into the nextone. Far from removing baggage and moving on, each Earth4ife simply collectsmore. Those stuck entirely in the audience (the few) realise that this is avirtual reality game, but they withdraw themselves so far from the intensity ofphysical experience that they don’t “feel” the emotions that lead to such agreater understanding of self and Creation. They cop out, you might say. Thereis a balance point here. It is to feel the emotion of physical, separatedinteraction in the moment it occurs and to react in whatever way seems right,but then to detach from that closein view (the movie) and observe why ithappened from the wider perspective (the audience). From this more detachedview, you can refocus on the understanding that you created the experience,whatever it was, because of something going on within you, or something fromwhich you were hoping to leam. It is so important to detach emotionally from themovie, but not so far that we lose the true power of the experiences it offers.I always find it more effective to scream “Aaaaaahhhh, bollocks to it” when Ihit my thumb with a hammer than to quietly whisper “Oh what a wonderful learningexperienceBut once I have hurled abuse at the hammer, I realise that while the hammer wasthe apparent cause of my pain, it was in my hand at the time. Experience themovie, then observe from the stalls. This approach can release emotional garbageand stop us taking on more. We can alsoPicture #172 [images/img_0172.png]149see those emotional cancers, fear, guilt and resentment in a very differentlight.Let us take guilt to start with. It’s incredible what makes us feel guilty. Ihave met people in their fifties and sixties who are still screwed up with theguilt of “failing” to achieve in their lives what their fathers or motherswanted them to achieve. I remember when my own soccer career ended witharthritis, how I felt worse about the effect this would have on my father than Idid for the loss of my own dreams. I felt guilty about getting an illness thatended the career I had dreamed about since childhood because of the pain itcaused my father. My own pain was far less important to me. Mind, I spent mostof my life feeling guilty about everything and anything. I could haverepresented England at feeling guilty. This creates a vicious cycle ofinterreaction. I remember that my own cycle, or rather downward spiral, wasgetting angry, feeling guilty about getting angry, and getting frustrated at theway I felt about myself as the guilt destroyed my self respect. This stimulatedfurther anger, which made me feel even more guilty... on and on it went yearafter year. How could I be me? I didn’t know who “me” was. “Me” was submergedand drowning in a sea of anger, guilt and plummeting self worth. As I look backit is clear that I hated myself, to be honest. There was this David Icke chap,the television linkman appearing on the screen smiling, confident and chummy.And yet behind those eyes and within that heart sat a little boy, lost andimprisoned by the turmoil of anger, guilt and self-disdain that swamped the loveat the core of my being, the love that is me. How can we love ourselves andtherefore love others unconditionally, cosmically, in the face of that deluge ofinner negative emotion? It is this emotion which is reacting and interreactingwith itself in what we call “life”, the world we see around us at home and onthe television news. Life on Planet Earth has become the interaction betweenprogrammed, emotional eggshells. The real us, love, hardly gets a look in. It isoften just a horrified spectator. True love rarely has the chance to communicateits wisdom, balance, and harmony and the world reflects precisely thatsituation.The people we meet are mirrors of ourselves or actors playing a role which canteach us something about ourselves and the world. We attract them to us becausethey mirror the vibes we are broadcasting from within or because their states ofbeing create an experience which can lead to greater understanding. When we seeconflict anywhere, be it an argument in a supermarket queue, a family upset, ora world war, wePicture #173 [images/img_0173.png]150are looking at inner turmoil being projected outwards and expressed as aphysical event. When we get angry with others, we are getting angry withourselves. It’s interesting how often you hear the comment: “It’s alright for soand so to do that, but when anyone else does the same he/ she goes crazy”. Thisresponse comes when we see a characteristic of ourselves which we don’t like,expressed by someone else. We often react to that person in a reallyover-the-top way because they are mirroring at us something we don’t wish toface about ourselves or their behaviour has pushed emotional buttons deep withinus that trigger memories of past life experiences or those from this life,especially from the emotional minefield we call childhood. I have seen peoplebecome vicious and violent when this happens to them. The focus of their angeris not the person involved, they are just the mirror. It is themselves they areattacking. But most people don’t realise that they are stuck in the movie andthe separation and they think it is real.But now look at guilt from the more detached view - the front row of the stalls.When we act negatively towards another person, that is a reflection of our ownsense of self, our own imagination of ourselves, at that moment. OK, if we aresensible, we learn from the consequences of what we did, evolve, and move on.That’s a positive experience for which we should be thankful. It has given usunderstanding. But, from the wider perspective, the person on the receiving endof that behaviour should be grateful too, once they have felt the initialemotional hurt. We create our own reality by attracting to us magnetically theenergy fields, people, experiences, which match the imagination of ourselvesthat we are broadcasting. Our behaviour is a reflection of our state of beingand that also applies to the experience of our “victim”. They attracted ourstate of being to them at that moment, and not another person who would havereacted very differently, because they needed to face what our state of beingcould give them. Instead of feeling guilty about what we have or have not doneto others, we need to leam from the experience, know that it was a gift, alearning experience for ourselves and for the other person or people. Theycreated it just as much as we did. Experience is how we evolve and we need thefull range of possible experiences for a balanced evolution. If we are going tohold on to guilt with every negative experience we have attracted, we are goingto be swamped with the stuff. And we have been. Look at us. Let us see guilt forwhat it really is - the unjustified emotional hand luggage that slows down ourjourney to Oneness because it destroys our sense of self. Guilt is merely thenegative side of experience. It isPicture #174 [images/img_0174.png]151valid in that it is an emotion we can feel and leam from. But it is not meant tobe in permanent residence, squatting in our psyche. Let it go. Let the weightsfall off. It’s time to fly. There is nothing to feel guilty about. No, not ever.A big movie star doesn’t feel guilty when he plays out the part of the “baddie”does he? Of course not. Then why do you? You’re a bigger star in a bigger movie.If you don’t like the part, change the script.The same applies to resentment. Just as we hold on to guilt for what we havedone to others, so we seethe with resentment, consciously and subconsciously,for what others have done to us. We seek revenge, sometimes conspiring to bringthat about, most often just wishing ills and “come-uppance” for those who dareto give us an experience that aids our evolution. How dare they help me toevolve? I am so angry. If the focus of our resentment does face a karmicreaction for their behaviour, the temptation is to laugh and feel that sense ofsatisfaction inside that says “they got what was coming to them”. We can hold onto resentment from childhood for an entire lifetime. And who suffers for that?Certainly not the people we are resentful about. They might be having a greattime while we suffer and seethe to an early grave through cancer, heart attacks,and other physical expressions of suppressed anger and resentment. Not veryclever is it, really? Resentment has multilevel consequences. It can mean thatchildren and parents don’t talk to each other for years, that neighbours ignoreeach other in the street, or that resentment passed on and indoctrinated fromparent to child perpetuates violence between communities for hundreds or eventhousands of years. There is nothing more destructive that a parent can do thanto bring up a child to resent other people or beliefs, because in that way theimbalances of the parents are visited on the children which are, in turn,collectively visited upon the community. Look at Northern Ireland, the Balkans,the Middle East, and other long term intergenerational trouble spots around theworld. When the parents grow up to the extent that they cease to see divisionsof race, colour, creed, religion or income bracket, the cycle of violence willend because the children will inherit that balanced view of life. If you nolonger wish to live amid violence and fear generation after generation, or youno longer want the anger and resentment to continue with your parents,neighbours, children, or friends, the answer is within you. Let go of your ownresentment. Go to the focus of your bitterness, look him, her, them, in the eyeand say how much you love them and you want the conflict to subside. How theywish to react to that offer is up to them,Picture #175 [images/img_0175.png]152but you have ended the conflict because conflict cannot exist without two sidesfull of bitterness for each other. If you no longer project bitterness theconflict must end because love and bitterness are never in conflict. They cannotbe because love is without judgment, bitterness, guilt or resentment - the veryfires that make conflict possible.It is the same with fear. It is our creation. Ask a group of people what mostfrightens them and you will get a stream of different answers. It may be boats,planes, small spaces, big spaces, spiders, snakes, speaking in public. The listis as long as human experience. What terrifies one person will have no effect onthe other. Why? Because fear, what we fear, whether we fear, is our individualchoice, our creation. It often has a past life origin and it is always anexpression of something within us that needs dealing with. This is why weattract to us what we most fear because we need to face those terrors and workthrough them, otherwise our evolution in the area of our lives related to thefear will come to a dead stop. Fear is like a cruise missile to our self esteem.It explodes it apart. We are embarrassed at being frightened of something and asthat leads to low self esteem and frustration, it creates an emotional cocktailthat often affects our whole lives. Fear can also become so panicked that itthrashes out first in violent confrontation, like some cornered rat. I seem tohave been frightened of everything as a child. I made room for the fear betweenall the guilt, you know. I should have organised a rota: 9.00am to 9.30am - feelguilty for not being what my father wants me to be; 9.30am to 10.30am - beterrified by the thought of the lesson with that horrible science teacher;10.30am to 12.30pm - feel guilty for how I treated my mate three years earlier;12.30pm to 1.30pm - lunch; you think I’m kidding? I was like an emotional roadtraffic accident. I could have feared for England, too.I guess the four biggest fears in my life were going to the dentist, flying,being ridiculed and speaking in public. My worst nightmare would have beenhaving a tooth out on a plane while making a speech to the laughing passengers.But I am the living proof that fear is our own individual creation. I don’t fearany of those things now. In fact I don’t fear anything on a scale that limits myactions and certainly nothing that is long term. Those fears, like all fears,were an expression of my sense of self. The dentist represented the fear of painand being out of control; flying was the fear of death and again, having mydestiny in the hands of another; ridicule related to my sense of inadequacy;Picture #176 [images/img_0176.png]153and the fear of speaking in public was the focus of my lack of self esteem, selflove and self respect. What we fear and how we fear is not some random accident,it reflects what is going on inside. I let go of the fear of pain after years ofagony from the arthritis, a condition that dramatically improved as I began toditch all this emotional baggage. My fear of death disappeared (and so offlying) when I realised that there is no death. My fear of having my destiny inthe hands of another dispersed when I knew that our destiny is never in thehands of anyone, but ourselves. It is our imagination of ourselves, our personalvibe, that decides if we are attracted to a plane that is going to crash orwhether we are attracted to andther flight that will get there safely. There areno accidents, only human creations within the universal law of what we think iswhat we create. My fear of ridicule was dealt with when I was a national figureof fun in the United Kingdom after going public with the story of what was anextraordinary and explosive spiritual awakening for me in the early 1990s. Andmy fear of speaking in public disappeared when I looked to myself forconfirmation that I am an OK person and not to an audience of people outside ofmyself. That is why so many people are frightened of speaking in public. Theyare looking for their self esteem outside of themselves in the reactions ofother people to what they say and do, instead of saying: I am what I am and Ihave a right to be what I am and express what I am. I am me, I am free. When youdo that, you respect the audiences’ right to be them, and to take whatever yousay as they see fit. But you are not nervous, frightened or intimidated, nomatter how big the attendance may be or even how hostile they may be to what youare saying. You know who you are, you have a right to be what you are, and toexpress that. When you get your power and self esteem from within, you don’tneed the audience to massage your sense of self. With that, the fear ofexpressing yourself publicly is gone. Experiencing these fears and eliminatingthem has given me so many gifts of understanding.These are not navel contemplating issues we are talking about here. This is notsome peripheral add-on or marginal subject we are addressing which can be putaside until the more important problems of the “real world” are sorted out. Thatisn’t the real world, it is a movie screen and the script is being written bythe emotional bilge within us. If we don’t let that go in a controlled way weare looking at a seriously unpleasant period of transition as the collectiveemotional build-up of thousands of years of Earth experience explodes in afrenzy of conflict and turmoil. But that doesn’t have to be. Everyone’s deeper,Picture #177 [images/img_0177.png]154unconscious self, is going to be attracting the experiences and triggersnecessary to remove the emotional anchors that are holding us back,vibrationally, from the level necessary to make the quantum jump to a new stateof consciousness. If we remain hypnotised by the movie and think it is real, theway we perceive these experiences will be very destructive. If we react to thepeople (mirrors) who provide these experiences for us from a perspective thatleads to resentment and the desire for revenge, all bloody hell will breakloose. Individuals, groups, countries, the world, will be tearing themselvesapart as the uncleansed emotions of centuries war and collide. The vibrationalstability of the planet will be severely imbalanced by such a scenario and theweather and geological consequences could indeed be catastrophic for those onthe three dimensional level of the Earth. What we do, in other words what wethink and feel, fundamentally affects the planet.You only have to look at how the Earth is abused by human activity to see howdeeply that understanding has been lost. This Earth exists on all levels withinthe virtual reality pyramid/vortex projected out of Oneness, just as we do. TheEarth consciousness, Gaia, the Earth Spirit, Mother Nature, whatever name youprefer, is the equivalent of our conscious level expressing itself through aphysical body. She feels what we individually and collectively feel. What statewould you be in if your physical body was being abused as hers continues to be?Or if your body was sucked clean of this liquid or raped for that mineral? Whatwould be your mental and emotional state if you lived among people whoconstantly bombarded your energy field with negativity, conflict, guilt,resentment, fear and ignorance? You would be in serious emotional turmoil. Well,so is the Earth consciousness and she also has a subconscious sewer of pent upemotions that need to be cleared and cleansed. Again, if they are released in anuncontrolled way, they will combine and conflict with the collective emotions ofhumanity and goodness knows what mayhem that will mean. Certainly geologicalactivity and weather extremes unprecedented in modern times. Our emotions have aphysical expression as tears, shaking, sweating, sickness, skin rashes, shoutingand violence. The Earth also has those expressions through rain, tidal waves,rising sea levels, earthquakes, diseased land, winds and volcanic activity.These we are going to see in vast extremes unless we emotionally step back fromthe movie and widen our understanding of who we are, what we are doing here, andhow we relate to the Earth and the rest of Creation. On top of all thisemotional release, the vibrational state of the planet is also beingPicture #178 [images/img_0178.png]155transformed by the quantum jump to another dimension of consciousness.There are two approaches here which can smooth this process along. First of all,we need to appreciate what is happening to us. The vibrations of the planet arerising. If we are to rise with them, up the neck of that bottle and out ofjail,we need to let go of the emotional baggage and the negative sense of self andothers that we have been conditioned to accept as reality. We can release theseemotions in the catastrophic way described above, or we can withdraw to thestalls and view this process very differently. We can see the people who pressour buttons and release our emotional sewage for what they really are teachersbearing the gifts of self understanding which will release us from the emotionalprisons which have blighted human existence for so ldng. Putting it another way,we can love our “enemies” and “forgive those who trespass against us”. This waywe release the emotions triggered by such experiences without adding yet furtherresentment to the sewer by resenting those who provide the experiences. We canalso see ourselves as teachers as we, too, act as triggers for the emotionalrelease of others. Again, we help them to cleanse their emotional burdenswithout adding to our own by feeling guilty at what we do to them. We can dealwith fear in a positive way by welcoming the opportunity to face our fears inthe knowledge that we are fantastic beings of light to which nothing isimpossible. There is nothing to fear. We live forever, whatever. Love is theenergy that will smooth the transition more than any other. Love is thetransition. There is no greater gift that we can give ourselves, our fellow menand women and the Earth, than love. The planet is feeling unloved because theplanet has been unloved. It is the same with humanity. You know how you benefitfrom love during your emotional crises and the Earth is no different. Send herlove whenever you can, just think it and she will feel it. And respect her bodyand her gifts. Make her feel loved, wanted and appreciated. You know how lovereduces anger, resentment, pain and frustration. Love her, love yourself, loveeveryone, and the journey into a dreamiand of balance and harmony need not be asbumpy as it will be if we stay asleep.Our emotions have been the means through which the fourth dimensionalmanipulation has been possible. The stimulation of fear has led to people givingtheir power away to those they believe will protect them from whatever they havebeen encouraged to fear; the stimulation of guilt has diminished self-love andself-respect, soPicture #179 [images/img_0179.png]156diminishing our sense of potential; the stimulation of envy and greed hasencouraged the few to monopolise wealth and power by violent acquisition; thestimulation of resentment has turned one violent or negative act into a cycle ofviolence and turmoil begetting more violence and turmoil in return; thestimulation of self-righteousness has created manufactured divisions andconflict between religions, kingdoms, political and economic systems, sexualpreferences, parents and children, bosses and bossed, men and women, as eachselfrighteous dogma seeks to kick and cuss its way to the point of domination atthe top of the greasy pole. How silly it all is. We are each other. We are thesame actor playing all the parts. It’s been an interesting movie and we now havethe chance in the final scene to leam the lesson we set out to teach ourselves:All you need is love.And love is boundless and infinite. There is no shortage of supply, no matterwhat the demand. You just think it and feel it and there it is. As much as youwant, whenever you want. Love is our golden key and it is under our control.Don’t tell me we can’t get out of here when we have in our possession all thatwe need for the great escape. The key, the ladder, and the getaway car, are justa state of being away. A state of being called love. You can love yourself orhate yourself. You can love others or hate others. You can love the Earth orabuse the Earth. You can race to the stars or stay in the stocks. These are justchoices choices that carry with them spiritual and physical consequences. Andthose choices are yours and mine.Picture #180 [images/img_0180.png]157Chapter 9By ‘Sin’ To The StarsWhen I began to realise that this world has been manipulated from the FourthDimension for thousands of years, it became clear that anything that would freeus from our three dimensional prison has either been suppressed or its truemeaning perverted and twisted.Nothing has been manipulated and twisted more than sex and so, I decided, thismust be at the very heart of our understanding of self and the reconnection withour multidimensional infinity. And so it is. Sex is not a quick bonk., .wham,bam, thank you ma’am. Nor is it sordid, dirty, and something to feel guiltyabout. In its highest expression, it is an ultimate spiritual experience betweentwo people in the dense physical world. It is a means through which we canconnect with the highest levels of ourselves and access our fantastic creativepower. We have been diverted from doing this by another group of oppo-samesreligion, the tabloid media, and the pornography industry. Religion, the tabloidpapers, and pornography on the same side? Yes, in their effect, certainly.To understand why, we need to look at the nature of physical experience and thegenetic spacesuit we call the body. What you see is only the physical level ofourselves, that face and body that stares back from the mirror. On levels unseenby the physical senses is our eternal consciousness, the aura, as some peoplecall it (Figure 9 overleaf). The aura 15 the amalgamation of the energy fieldswhich together make up the thinking, feeling, emotional us. Or at least thatpart of the eternal “I” which is working directly through the body. One of theselevels, the etheric, is the intelligence which organises the replacement ofcells, controls the electrical system of the body, and generally governs thebody’s activities. When the etheric energy field is imbalanced, as it is throughemotional disharmony, the emotional dis-ease becomes physical dis-ease. Someetheric imbalances, for example, disrupt the smooth replacement of cells andthis is known to us as cancer. WhatPicture #181 [images/img_0181.png]158Picture #182 [images/img_0182.png]we call cancer is cell replacement gone haywire. So called “modern medicine”continues to treat cancer by cutting away the rogue cells and dosing people withradiation. This reflects the “scientific” obsession with the physical level ofbeing and medicine’s obsession with treating symptoms rather than causes. Thecause of cancer is etheric disruption, usually stimulated by emotionaldisruption, although contact with electromagnetic energy fields, like powerlines and electrical equipment, can also trigger cancerous cell replacementbecause the electromagnetism destabilises the magnetic balance of the ethericenergy field. The immune system is also controlled from the etheric159and so emotional or electromagnetic influences can seriously damage our body’snatural defences and make us more prone to illness. Dying of a broken heart isto be so emotionally traumatised that the etheric is thrown out of balance andthe body reflects that in a terminal illness or heart failure. We literally diefrom emotional hurt and during the writing of this book I felt emotional painthat gave me an insight into how this is possible.The means through which our balances and imbalances are transferred through thelevels of being is the chakra system. “Chakra” is an ancient Sanskrit wordmeaning wheel of light. The chakras are vortexes of energy which intersect ourlevels of self, and therefore an imbalance in the emotional energy field will bepassed through the chakras to the mental level (we stop thinking straight), andvia the etheric to the physical (we become dis-eased). We have many of thesechakra vortexes, large and small, but there are seven main ones in the body, andothers outside the body which connect us with the higher realms of ourconsciousness. Each vibrates to the frequency of a particular colour and sound.The seven main body chakras are positioned at the bottom of the spine through tothe pubic bone (base or root chakra); just below the navel (sacral or splenicchakra); between the navel and the chest (solar plexus chakra); the centre ofthe chest (heart chakra); the throat (throat chakra); the centre of the forehead(third eye chakra); and the top of the head (crown chakra) (Figure 10 overleaf).I also believe there are major chakras in the feet which connect and “ground” uswith the Earth. Each of these chakra vortexes centres represents one level ofbeing. The lower three chakras are of the Earth, the top three are of thespirit, and the heart is the centre of balance between them. The root chakra(red) roots us into the physical and through the genitals creates physical life.The second chakra (orange) is closely related to the root chakra. It is oursexuality centre and has a powerful connection to the etheric body. The solarplexus chakra (yellow) is the seat of our emotions, hence we feel our emotionsin that area of the abdomen. The heart chakra (green) is from where we expressthe energy called love and this is how the ancient connection between the heartand love originates. Today, in our obsession with the physical, this link ismade to the physical heart, but its origin comes from knowledge of the spiritualheart, the heart chakra. The throat chakra (blue) governs our ability tocommunicate and express ourselves. The Third Eye chakra (indigo) on the foreheadis the centre for our psychic senses, the ability to see, perceive, and accessPicture #183 [images/img_0183.png]160Picture #184 [images/img_0184.png]Figure 10: the Chakra systeminformation from beyond the physical. The Crown chakra (violet) is ourconnection with the chakras outside of our body - the rest of the cosmos.The “halos” depicted around the head of “Jesus” and other figures portrayed inreligious art are in fact the light energy emitting from the crown chakra. Asyou become more psychically sensitive, you can see this light around the headsof people. It is the same, too, with the idea of angels with wings. The “wings”are energy pouring out of the crown chakra like a fountain. I have seen this insome people during a heightened sense of awareness and it can look like twowhite wings. They are not physical wings, they are energy wings which can liftus to the stars. The chakras transmit their state of being directly to thephysical through the glands of the endocrine system. The control centre161for this system is the pineal gland in the centre of the brain, which connectswith the “third eye” chakra, our psychic sight. The pineal is also closelyconnected with the physical eyes and it is true that indeed “the eyes are thewindow on the soul”. When we look into someone’s eyes we are looking deep intotheir multidimensional consciousness via the eyes-pineal gland-third eye-cosmosconnection. You can tell so much about a person by looking into their eyes. Thepineal and the other glands of the endocrine system release hormones into thebody in response to the changing state of the chakras and these hormones affectthe body in positive and negative ways. It is at this point that mainstreammedical science enters the scene, with the release of the hormones and theireffect on the body. They have closed their minds to what happens before that,the instructions transmitted from the chakras to the glands, because torecognise the existence of the chakras would lead to the acknowledgement of themultidimensional levels of being and their effect on the physical body In otherwords, the whole basis on which medical science operates (drags and scalpels)would tumble and so would the profits of the multinational drag companies whichcontrol the “medical” system. It is self interest which has created thedisinterest in seeing the human being as far more than a physical bodyAppreciating the existence of the chakra system is vital to understanding thereal significance of sex. The root chakra at the base of the spine draws inenergy from the Earth known as the kundalini, another Sanskrit word meaningserpent or sleeping snake. Throughout Eastern, and indeed many other religions,you will see the serpent used to symbolise the kundalini energy. Look at thestory of Adam and Eve as just one example and how funny that the symbol of themodern medical profession is an ancient serpent representation of the kundalini- an energy that profession does not even acknowledge to exist! The kundalini ispart of the lifeforce and it provides the sexual energy that triggers ourcreative potential. The energy people use to create an inspired painting, book,speech or piece of pottery is the same energy that stimulates sexual activityand explodes into orgasm. It is the creative force, the same creative force thatcreates new life. As a friend of mine says: we are walking, talking, sex bombs!This is why the Satanic sexual rituals involving the terrorising of adults andchildren are constantly performed by the All Seeing Eye and its Global Elite toaccess and trigger the creative force in its most negative form.If the creative energy is suppressed, by the suppression of sexual feelings andnatural talent, its power becomes imbalanced. This willPicture #185 [images/img_0185.png]162manifest in other ways - through violence, rape, crime, wars and depression.More spiritual sex less global violence! Also, when people are allowed andencouraged to express their own unique creativity, the kundalini flows inharmony, and the cQnflict, within and without, subsides. Dumping people inmind-numbing factories and office blocks creates the seeds for innerfrustration, and so outward disharmony and conflict because the creative energyis being denied and suppressed. Appropriately, the word “evil” is the word“live” in reverse! But when the suppression of the creative energy leads tocrime, violence and disharmony, what is society’s response? To impose stricterlaws and more restriction, so further suppressing the creative force and leadingto more crime, violence and disharmony. When the creative force is suppressed itbecomes destructive. That certainly applies to sex.Through our childhood, the kundalini trickles up the central channel (thespiritual spinal column) triggering and activating the other chakas at arelatively low level. This is why most children are not stirred sexually untiladolescence. It is also how their true potential to think and create issuppressed until their bodies are capable of manifesting what their minds knoware possible, a point I made earlier about why the consciousness of a child doesnot express its real self until many years into a physical life. An adult mindin a baby’s body would produce unbearable frustration. Around the time we callpuberty, however, the kundalini begins to unfurl from the root chakra in muchgreater quantities. It activates the genital areas and we begin to acknowledgeour sexuality. We start to see boys and girls in a rather different light. It isthe evolution from “come and play with my train set” to “Cor, I don’t half fancyher”. As we know, puberty triggers massive hormonal changes and this is thekundalini stimulating the chakras, which then cause the glands of the endocrinesystem to release the hormones.The unwinding of the kundalini affects us far more than just sexually. Itresonates to the colour red and is symbolised as fire. This is very appropriatebecause as it flows through all the chakras it sets them ablaze vibrationally.When the kundalini is flowing smoothly and powerfully, we become more sensitive,and our minds become more alert, inquiring and open. The kundalini stimulatesour memory and our ability to retain information. Our creative potential soars.A powerful kundalini gives us a strong magnetic connection with the Earth and asit shoots out through the crown chakra at the top of the head it connects uswith our other chakras at the higher levels of our being. We become both of theEarth and of the spirit, the perfectPicture #186 [images/img_0186.png]163balance. That’s the process as it is meant to happen, anyway. That’s what humanbeings are supposed to be, the balance of the physical and spiritual. Instead,we are dominated by one or the other, usually the physical, or we are out ofsync with both of them.What happens for most people is that the kundalini does not transform them in asmooth and balanced way. In fact it can be a nightmare. We are back to themanipulation of this world from the negative elements of the Fourth Dimensionwhere the effects of the awakening kundalini are well understood. If you want toturn the human race into prisoners of this three dimensional reality it isessential to stem, or massively imbalance, the flow of kundalini. You disconnectthem from both a powerful link with the Earth and the higher realms of spiritand themselves. To rise through the chakras and connect us with our higherlevels of spirit, the kundalini must pass through the sacral chakra, the centreof our sexuality, and the solar plexus chakra, the centre of our emotions. Thesecan be such a mass of denial, fear and negative emotion, that they act as avibratory dam, turning the kundalini back on itself and creating a lifetime ofturmoil in that lower abdomen area which often results in physical dis-ease.These “dams” also prevent a powerful flow of kundalini from activating thepotential of the higher chakras, the heart, throat, third eye and crown, somaking impossible a true connection with the higher spiritual dimensions ofourselves. We operate on the level of the spaceman in the spacesuit delinkedfrom Mission Control and we become a manipulator’s puppet. People in this state(the vast, vast majority) are neither of the Earth or of the spirit. They are ofthe limbo land somewhere between them. One means by which this is achievedbrings us back to sex.The same fourth dimensional force which created and used religion, particularlyChristianity, Judaism, and Islam, to destroy the truth about sex, also inspiredthe culture of pornography and the quick “bonk”. The common theme between theseoppo-sames is closing down the root chakra, imbalancing the sacral and emotionalchakras, and stemming the flow of kundalini, which if left alone would activateand connect all levels of being into wholeness. Religion has turned sex into afocus for an explosion of guilt of atomic proportions. The institution ofmarriage is at the heart of this, but it is not the only reason by any means.Marriage institutionalises separation. He’s mine, she’s mine. I marry you,therefore I own you. This is the spoken or unspoken reality of marriage andrelationships in general. It is the means through which people buy into amanufactured sense of security and a desperatelyPicture #187 [images/img_0187.png]164limited version of “love”. They buy the fairy stories about wedding days andhappy every afters. Most marriage is not about love, but possession and control.Only a tiny few marriages are fulfilling the partners. They may not realise whythey feel empty and unfulfilled, but it’s because their real potential to expandand create is being suppressed by this institutionalised prison. Theconsequences of walking away are too much for most people to contemplate andthat is the only reason why the divorce rate, already rising rapidly, is not atidal wave. Soon it will be.I am not suggesting that it is not right to live with someone for whom you havegreat affection, even love, or that there shouldn’t be some publicly spokencommitment to each other, if that’s what the couple desire. I am saying that toinstitutionalise that commitment, to bring the church and state into it, and tocreate penalties for withdrawing at a later stage, is utterly ridiculous. Howcan you turn a human relationship into something regulated by the state? How cansomeone be expected to commit themselves at the age of 20 or 25 to anotherperson for the rest of their lives? Who knows what lies ahead or how the twowill change in their attitude to life and each other? The whole idea is crazy.Yet for thousands of years that is the mockery of love and relationships whichreligion has visited upon the human race. It is considered better to suffer yourpain and stay in a marriage than to say you have grown apart and it’s time tomove on. In countries under the fiercest religious domination, like Ireland, ithas been against the law to end a marriage! And yet Ireland has still calleditself a free country. I don’t remember even Josef Stalin suggesting thatmarriage could never be ended. A referendum in 1995 voted by a very smallmajority to repeal that law in Ireland, but still people battle to retain theright of church and state to dictate to the population who they will and willnot have an official relationship with. According to this mental state, it isbetter to continue a marriage which both partners hate, than to bring it to anatural conclusion and free the partners to find love elsewhere. It also createsthe unbelievable situation in which children at the moment of birth are dubbed“illegitimate” because their parents are not officially connected by a piece ofheaded notepaper. There is no such thing as illegitimate life. It doesn’t existexcept in the padlocked human mind. I would suggest that anyone who sees life interms of legitimate and illegitimate, is in need of some serious help. Just asreligion has survived through hypocrisy of an Olympian scale, so I guess it isappropriate, that its institution of marriage should demand so often the samehypocrisy toPicture #188 [images/img_0188.png]165hold it together. Surely love should be the bond which holds two people in arelationship, not a piece of paper and a sense of duty. Most marriage is notbased on love. Its reason for being is companionship, financial security, habit,social conformity and fear of the alternative. What a basis on which to liveyour life with someone. Perhaps the most destructive element of the marriagegame is that it institutionalises and makes a part of the law of the land thebelief that you can only love one person at a time, preferably for life. Itmakes official the law of separation and denies the law of Oneness.This has fundamental effects on the flow of the kundalini. Sometimes you need tointeract sexually with more than one person in your life, even after marriage,because different people affect you in different ways. One person’sconsciousness - energy fields - will activate yours in a slightly, sometimesdramatically, different way to another. The kundalini is not just one blob ofenergy, it has many different elements which need to be stimulated and awakenedif we are going to enjoy our true and infinite creative potential. It is notonly sexual activity which opens the kundalini, but it is one very powerful andrapid way to trigger the serpent transformation. I had a very close relationshipwith my wife, Linda, after we met and married within a few weeks in 1971. I was19 and she was 21. She is an amazing woman and I don’t regret one second of theyears I spent with her. The fact that I married her is irrelevant. Gettingmarried was something people were supposed to do when they loved each other, sowe did. The bond which held between us through some experiences that would haveshattered most relationships into a thousand pieces is not marriage, it is love.You only know the true strength of a relationship when the bond is challenged byevents. So many “ideal” relationships fall at that point because they are builton conditional love and self delusion. The biggest challenge to my bond withLinda came in 1991 when I had a sexual relationship with another woman amidfront page headlines. I had no idea at the time why I did that or why ithappened. My life in the weeks before and after was lived in some dream-state. Ididn’t know where I was or what was happening to me. I reacted in the way we areprogrammed to react in such situations. I was consumed by guilt and remorse somassive I thought it would destroy me. It took me years to work it through andcope with the assault on my self-esteem and the self-love which I found so hardto feel. But I see things differently now.From the perspective of the kundalini, that situation can be viewed from a muchhigher level of understanding, the stalls, not the movie.Picture #189 [images/img_0189.png]166Within two weeks of that sexual relationship starting my whole consciousness haderupted into a new sense of self and reality. Every fibre of my being was goingthrough a transformation which opened my mind and my eyes to so much. As I wasstaggering, physically, emotionally and mentally, to cope with a mass of newknowledge and understanding pouring into my conscioustiess, I went public withwhat I was experiencing and began my period of immense public ridicule the“turquoise period” as I call it - when I was obsessed with that colour for morethan a month. I didn’t know what was going on and I didn’t for many years thatfollowed. But now I do. The sexual relationship with another consciousness had,in part, created the vibrational trigger which helped to open the root andsacral chakras and allowed the kundalini to flood my aura, activating myemotional, mental and spiritual chakra centres as it rose through my body.Suddenly each of those chakras was also opened, so flooding my aura with theirknowledge and connecting me with higher levels of myself from which my mind hadbeen delinked, at least consciously, until that moment. Is it any wonder I wasin such a spin at the time? It was like sitting in a room with 50 televisionsblaring out at once and all tuned to a different station offering differentinformation. The kundalini doesn’t have to affect you like that, it can happenmuch less traumatically, but it was an immense learning experience for me andthose around me. It also happened at exactly the right time. Had thattransformation happened any earlier, I would not have experienced life in theprogrammed world with all the delusions and emotions that come from that. It wasso important to live those experiences, given what I am doing now.Because of the abuse of sex by the church, state, and tabloid media, it hasbecome a ‘’sin” and a reason for enormous guilt and condemnation to have asexual relationship with more than one person at the same time. If you aremarried as well, aaaaaahhhh! String him up, put him in the stocks. He’s unfit tobe alive. While the church parrots the cliche’s about the world needing morelove, the moment you express that love physically for more than one person, itsuddenly becomes a terrible thing. Of course love does not have to take a sexualexpression, and in all but a few cases during our lives, it will not. But it canbe reflected physically if that is right for the evolution of the peopleinvolved and if we and society cannot accept this, we are revealing just howimmature we are as a human race - and how insecure. You can love more than oneperson at the same time. Many people, even those on the spiritual path, tell meit can’t be done - but itPicture #190 [images/img_0190.png]167can. It can. You love them in different ways, that’s all. The focus and natureof that love may change at different times, but it is still love. This is noteasy in the world today, I know. However, I believe it is possible. We are OneConsciousness. Are we really saying that we can only love, physically, mentally,emotionally and spiritually, one aspect of ourselves at one time? Are we really?My God. Many people who say they love someone unconditionally, later revealotherwise as the “league tables” start to appear: “You spend more time with thisperson than me” or “You do this for that person, but not for me”. Relationshipswhich begin (or think they do) on the basis of no-agenda love so oftendegenerate into league table love and their purity is lost. Unconditional lovedoes not have league tables, it just loves. Totally and always.Each person gives us something others cannot, because everyone is different. Ifwe celebrate the fact that we are unique, we can see how we can gain knowledge,understanding and a greater insight into love and ourselves, by experiencing andinteracting with different people in different ways. Our love for one does nothave to diminish our love for another; indeed that love can grow as we trulyunderstand what love is, and our power to express love expands. I know from myown journey these past few years that as the kundalini flows and opens us to ourmultidimensional wonder, parts of our personality emerge that we didn’t know wehad. It’s like pulling the cord on one of those automatic life rafts. Suddenlyour consciousness, locked and folded away for so long, unfurls and expands toproduce a structure so large that you would not believe it was achievable whenyou look at the small space (the closed mind) from whence it came. Thesenewly-freed parts of us need a focus of expression through people who arecompatible with them. Different parts of our eternal self sometimes needstimulation by different people. This way all elements of self are activated,stimulated and challenged to grow and not only those which relate to the stateof being of one person or partner. This goes both ways. One person can’t give meall that I need to grow multidimensionally and neither can I do that for them.No one person can provide everything another will need for their evolution toOneness, but - and this is the point - the manipulation from the FourthDimension over thousands of years has made society think this is possible andthis myth has even been institutionalised and made part of state law. This iscrazy. What are we doing to ourselves?The effects on human life and intelligence of this ignorance of sex has beenfundamental to our plight. It has created another vicious cyclePicture #191 [images/img_0191.png]168of fear, guilt and resentment. Here is just one scenario to make the point. If aman or woman feels the intuitive urge to become close with a person other thantheir marriage or regular partner, they can either suppress that urge becausethey fear the consequences in a society that doesn’t understand, or they can goahead and feel terribly guilty because they, too, have been conditioned tobelieve that this is seriously wrong. Either way their root, sacral andemotional chakras are thrown into vibratory turmoil and the flow of kundalinibecomes diminished and imbalanced. When the marriage partner finds out about therelationship, he or she will be overwhelmed with resentment and as thatresentment relates to sexuality, their root, sacral and emotional chakras closedown or imbalance the kundalini. This will not only affect the sexuality of thethree people, it will diminish them emotionally, intellectually and spirituallyas the other chakra centres lose their powerful connection with the energy thatfires them on the physical the kundalini. Yet it is not that these relationshipsituations are wrong, merely that society is conditioned to believe they arewrong. These situations are not right or wrong, they just are. They are part ofthe unique journey of learning and experience for all involved. Others won’tneed that experience and so it won’t happen to them. They’ll be challenged inother ways. If we were all bom into a world in which the wider understanding andopenness about sex were accepted, the pain caused by relationships and sex wouldplummet. As it is we are programmed to feel pain when certain circumstancesarise and so we do. This is why it is such a challenge for those seeking toexpose this imprisonment. We are doing it within a collective consciousness thathas been programmed to condemn, judge, and see the world and themselves througha microscopic tunnel vision. But this will change and it is changing. You watch.Religion has been the major force for the fourth dimensional manipulation todelink humanity from its true destiny and the abuse of sex has been at theforefront of this. They have gone so far in some religions as to make celibacy avirtue. How do you find the key to heaven? You cross your legs, bite your lip,and have buckets of cold water at the ready. Hello, is that the fire brigade?Bishop’s palace speaking. One of our erections is ablaze. How soon can you gethere? The legacy of fear and guilt which religion has passed across thegenerations in its arrogant, childish and manipulative view of sex beggarsbelief. Once again poor old God gets the blame for insisting we deny ourfeelings. But am I really supposed to believe that the GodPicture #192 [images/img_0192.png]169who made this incredible multidimensional universe, with its perfection down tothe last ant and blade of grass, is sitting somewhere in torment worrying aboutwhat I do with my dangly bits? If people choose to be celibate, that’s fine. Weshould all do what we feel is right for us and we don’t have to have sex toawaken the kundalini. It can be done through meditation and visualisation too,and it is also triggered by astrological influences. But if people practicecelibacy without understanding about the kundalini some very unpleasant eventscan ensue. If the kundalini is suppressed because of the sexual urges it isstimulating, this creates an energy “war” between the kundalini which wishes tounfurl and the person’s mind and emotions which are seeking to push it back.This vibrational conflict can manifest as severely imbalanced sexuality andother mental and emotional disharmony. It is no mystery why, as is now evident,the sexual abuse of children in the Roman Catholic Church has been so rife. Itis an expression of an imbalanced kundalini caused by suppressing a naturalprocess of human development and, on many occasions, the Satanic manipulation ofa child’s sexual energy in line with the black magic practices of the Cult ofthe All Seeing Eye. Nor is it a mystery why that church, from the Pope down, hassuch a limited vision of life, humanity and creation. Without the kundaliniflowing powerfully to activate and open the gateways to intellectual andspiritual infinity, the vision must always be barely one dimensional. Also, thatwhich feels fear will project fear. Most religions fear sex and therefore usethe fear of sex to manipulate and control.But what is true of the church is equally true of the tabloid media andpornography. If people want to pose naked for photographs doing things withtheir bits and bobs, that’s OK by me. And if others want to buy those papers andlook at those pictures, that’s equally OK. I’m not seeking to judge, merely topoint out what I believe are the consequences of certain actions. The hypocrisyof the tabloid media mirrors that of the church. They sell their papers throughsexual titillation, but then moralise about the sexual behaviour of the verypeople whose “exposure” sells their newspapers. When I was a journalist workingfor a news agency in the 1970s, I had a call from the London News Of The Worldto ask me if there had been any court cases in my area that week involving rape.The News Of The World did not, I was told, have enough rape cases for thatweek’s paper. This is the mentality that publicly judges the lives of others!The tabloid media seeks to arouse its customers sexually while, at the sametime, tellingPicture #193 [images/img_0193.png]170them that sex is outrageous and naughty. They want the erection, but condemn theconnection. They have turned sex, the most beautiful and ecstatic state aphysical form can produce, into the equivalent of artificial insemination. Thecosmic orgasm has descended into “Cor, Td give ‘er one”. This view of sex isequally destructive to that of the church if it doesn’t evolve into somethingmuch greater. Sex is not a series of quick gropes which momentarily satisfymerely physical desires. That is not of the spirit because it denies the spiritand diminishes the spirit. The sexual experience stays in the root and lowerc’hakras because it is operating overwhelmingly as a physical exchange. This,too, suppresses and perverts the kundalini with all the effects that has on theemotional, mental and spiritual development of that human being. The misuse andmanipulation of sex by these apparent “opposites”, religion and the media, hasled both to massive guilt, fear and resentment in our attitude to sex, and via asuppressed and imbalanced kundalini, to a disconnection from our higher mentaland spiritual potential. Put another way, root chakra sex, as promoted byreligion and the tabloids, can keep you in a mental and emotional prison whilecosmic sex can lift you to the stars. It is appropriate that tabloid newspaperswhich are obsessed with quickbonk sex also treat their readers like intellectualbuffoons. One is a consequence of the other.So what is sex at the cosmic level?Sex has become for so many a physical event when it really has the potential tobe a multidimensional ecstasy. There is root chakra sex, an overwhelminglyphysical experience, the goal of which is ejaculation the outward projection ofenergy, an energy loss. This leaves the partners tired and often with a sense ofanticlimax and emptiness. Was that it? This is the view of sex found in thetabloid newspapers and pornography. Then there is multichakra sex which takes ussoaring into the spiritual realms of being. This is when the energy stimulatedin the root chakra rises through all the chakras and explodes outwards into theaura as a spiritual orgasm rather than just physical ejaculation, although itcan be a combination of both. This is spiritual love rather than sex because itis predominantly spiritual, not physical. It is when both partners merge into amale-female wholeness which raises their collective consciousness to vibratorylevels which connect them with higher states of consciousness - Oneness. Sex atthat level of awareness takes us into timelessness when we are without thought,fear, guilt orPicture #194 [images/img_0194.png]171resentment. We just “are”. We are out of our bodies and into our deeper self,out of our heads and into our feelings, our spirit (Figure 11 overleaf). Wewithdraw from this programmed world and access levels of consciousness farbeyond this physical planet. When I have experienced spiritual love in this way,I have felt a fantastic flow of information, love and insight, pouring into mymind in the minutes and hours that followed, because the multichakra orgasm haslifted my consciousness to the vibratory levels which hold that information andlove. It is like making love during an earthquake! Such an amazing level ofspiritual love and vibrational connection between two people is so rare. Mostlywe travel through many lifetimes without feeling that indescribable,multidimensional harmony with another human being which explodes as an immenselypowerful creative force - love in its purest expression. When you have felt thatwith someone you may no longer need or desire to express love physically withanother. You know instinctively that nothing could compare with the connectionyou have with that person. So you see I am not calling for a sexual free for allhere. Not least because when we have sex we merge to a larger or lesser extentwith the energies of the other person. We absorb, vibrationally, part of them,their very essence. Who we make love with, and on what level it is expressed,has consequences for both partners long after the actual event. All I am sayingis that, it is not right or wrong to make love with more than one person. It ismerely an experience along the road to finding that spiritual-sexual ecstacy.Once you have experienced that - and you’ll know when you have!you can often spend the rest of your life with that person and never need asexual union with anyone else. There are no norms, only experiences on the roadto Oneness. Everyone is different and needs to experience different things.Cosmic sex leaves you ablaze with energy, rather than tired, and this istransmitted to every cell in the body, stimulating them to vibrate quicker andso make us feel “alive”. There is an energy gain rather than a loss. Thisprovides us with more creative energy to express in other areas of our lives.There is nothing wrong with ejaculation, there’s nothing wrong with anything aslong as it is not imposed against another’s will, but there is a much greatermeaning to sex than the very narrow idea of sexual release and relief that weare conditioned to accept. A mixture of all possibilities offers the range ofall experience and potential. Children conceived in such high orgasmic statescan incarnate on a very high vibration, too.Picture #195 [images/img_0195.png]172Picture #196 [images/img_0196.png]Figure 11: “Cosmic” sex is an explosion of creative energy.173To reach these cosmic levels of sex we need to stop trying so hard. Sex, likeeverything, has become a competition, a contest, a symbol of our manhood andwomanhood. Is he any good in bed? Is she good between the sheets? Do I satisfymy man/woman? Am I good at it? This has brought yet more fear to the sexualexperience because each partner is trying to “perform” for the other. Sod that.It is not a performance. It is not a doing, it is a being. If you relax and just“be” without trying to do or achieve anything, you begin to let go of theprogrammed responses of what sex is or isn’t. If you don’t focus your mind onthe end goal (ejaculation and orgasm), you enter timeless, relaxed states ofhigher consciousness for far longer. You can only enjoy each moment to itsgreatest potential if you get your head out of the past and the future.Ejaculation and orgasm are in the future and if that is in your head from thestart, you lose the power of each moment. To do that, means simply to “be”without thoughts of what may or may not be to come, if you’ll pardon theexpression. Sex is not a stage show, it is a unique experience every time if youallow it to be unique instead of playing out the script provided by religion,the tabloid media, and the guys down the bar.The attempts to diminish us sexually even include the myth and manipulationcalled AIDS. The scare stories about AIDS have created tremendous fears oversex. We are told that the HIV virus causes the destruction of the immune systemknown as AIDS and that HIV is transmitted sexually. Both claims are simply alie. HIV is a weak virus and the last thing it does is destroy the immunesystem. Thousands of people die of “AIDS” who are not HIV positive and millionswho have been HIV positive for ten years and more are still perfectly healthy.The figures have been cooked! If you die of, say, tuberculosis and you are HIVpositive, you are said to have died of AIDS. If you die of tuberculosis and youare not HIV positive, you are said to have died of tuberculosis. The myths andlies are even built into the diagnosis.Dr Robert Gallo, the man who said HIV causes AIDS, has since been accused ofscientific misconduct and two of his assistants have been charged with criminaloffences. Gallo patented the test for HIV antibodies and he gets a royalty forevery one. And that’s another point. They don’t test for the HIV vims, only forthe antibodies which the immune system produces to fight the vims! AIDS has manycauses but not HIV Anything which breaks down the immune system causes AIDS andthat includes recreational drags and the drags, like AZT, used to “fight” HIY avirus which does not cause AIDS! It’s all a con and whatPicture #197 [images/img_0197.png]174a time bomb it has been for our attitude to sexuality.11 will go into thissubject in detail in my next book.The reason that humanity’s spiritual evolution has been much slower than itcould have been is that we have denied ourselves and each other the right toexperience. The course of evolution is very simple: experience, leam, evolve.The rules and regulations, the dos, don’ts, musts, and mustn’ts, imposed overthe centuries by religions and other thought controllers, have narroweddramatically the depth and breadth of experience that we are allowed to havebefore meeting the resistance of ridicule or condemnation. We have become afraidto experience and this has become ingrained as a fear of change because changeexperience. We cling to ways of life and attitudes which will not bring newexperience because we have been conditioned to fear experience. Life becomes aseries of tedious repetitions and it is this very repetition of thought andbehaviour that makes us so easy to control. Western society’s view of sex is amost potent example of this. Once you have a marriage certificate, you are nolonger supposed to have any sexual experience with anyone except your officialpartner. This seeks to deny a massive area of experience, therefore learning,therefore evolution. Many people are so insecure within themselves that theyhold their partner in emotional handcuffs and go crazy if they even talk toanother man or woman. Others are more open and don’t so much mind anintellectual interaction between their partner and a member of another sex. Butall, except a tiny, tiny few highly enlightened beings have a major emotionalblock with the thought of their partner making love physically with another. Itis the physical experience that stimulates all the pain, guilt and resentment. Iunderstand this and I’m not saying that sex with other partners is good or bad,nor right or wrong, only that it is a choice that people have a right to makewithout condemnation. The body is the outward expression of themind-emotions-spirit, the mind made physical. It is a way for two human beingsto express love for each other and share their energy if that is what theychoose to do. Again I ask: what the hell is the big deal? Let’s remember herethat all is one and one is all. When we make love to another human being we are,in effect, making11 strongly recommend a book called AIDS, The Good News Is That HIVDoesn ’tCause It. The Bad News Is Recreational Drugs And Medical Treatments Like AZT Do.It’s written and researched by Peter Duesberg PhD and John Yiamooyiannis PhD,and published by Health Action Press. 6439 Taggart Road. Delaware, Ohio 43015,in 1995.Picture #198 [images/img_0198.png]175love to part of ourselves. When we reach the stage of cosmic, multichakraorgasm, we are making love to the universe, to Creation, to all that exists, andwe are making available more creative energy for all to use and benefit from.And that is a crime? That is immoral? That is a reason for guilt, resentment andcondemnation?What on Earth have we come to? Rock bloody bottom,that’s where we’ve come to - and the only way is up.Morality always means limitation and hypocrisy. Morality you can’t. It denies abasic human right - the right to experience and to be who and what we uniquelyare. Morality sets out someone else’s view of the perfect human being anddemands that everyone conforms to that. Such morality requires an arrogance ofgenuine world class. Because no-one matches the blueprint of this “perfect”human (including, often especially, the moralist who makes the blueprint),everyone goes around denying their real feelings or feeling guilty for notconforming to the blueprint. Because society gives a hard time to anyone fallingbelow the standards set by the moralists, people put up the masks and try to kideveryone that they are living “moral” lives even when they are not. It is aworld of denial, fear, lies, hypocrisy and secrecy. It need not be. It onlyhappens because we fear what other people think of us and what other peoplethink of us is conditioned by the few who decide the so called “standards”.We are back to the Hassle-Free Zones again. Yet who are these moralists who tellus what we can and can’t experience? From my observations, they are seriouslyscrewed up emotionally and, ironically, screwed up about the very issue they aremoralising about. When you suppress something, it takes on a much greaterimportance. When you want to lose weight, food is on your mind far more thanwhen you are eating what you choose. Denial always stimulates an obsession withwhatever you are denying. Instead of the energy flowing through you in aharmonious, natural way, as it does when you allow yourself to go with thatflow, it recycles itself around your energy fields, so staying at the centre ofyour thoughts. If you seek to deny your sexual feelings, you will be thinking ofsex far more than if you flow with your feelings. The moralists who seek tosuppress their own sexual feelings because of fear and guilt, then becomeobsessed with the sexual activity of others. You recognise the type: “This sexmovie is a moral outrage andPicture #199 [images/img_0199.png]176I should know - I’ve seen it five times”. Their denial of their own sexualitymakes them obsessed with sex. These are the moral guardians who tell us what tothink and seek to dictate what we can and can’t do, watch and say!Never be afraid to experience if your intuitive self, the flow of energy withinyou, is leading you in that direction. We live forever. What is one experience?If you don’t like it and it doesn’t work out, you learn from the experience andevolve. If you do like it and it does work out, you also leam from theexperience and evolve. Again, experience is not good or bad, it just is. Onething is for sure, the more you deny yourself the experiences your inner self isleading you into, the more turmoil you feel as the conflict ensues in yourpsyche and the longer it will take for you to reach higher levels ofunderstanding. I feel we need to let go of the absolutes which deny us so much.These absolutes show themselves in phrases like “right, that’s it, it’s overforever” or “I’ll never talk to that person again” or “I would never do that,not ever”. Apart from life itself, nothing is forever and nothing is for never.All is there to experience on the road to Oneness. Everything in Creation isconstantly moving, every expression of energy is dancing to the changing rhythmof life. If we seek to stand still and to turn our lives and attitudes intoconcrete thought patterns and rigid predictability, we are in fact trying tostand still in a fast flowing river and soon it will be a tidal wave as thevibes continue to quicken. We seek to be static eggshells while surrounded by avibrational sea of movement and flow. No wonder that life is such a mental,emotional and physical battle in those circumstances. You are literally usingall your energy just to stand still! But whether you welcome and celebrateexperience or whether you deny it, doesn’t really matter. Either way you willget there in the end. Denial just means it takes longer and causes you a greatdeal of emotional turmoil which you could avoid if you allow rather than denyyour feelings. The point I am making is that we should have the right, withoutpressure, ridicule or condemnation, to make our own choice about what weexperience without some moralising know-it-all dictating what we can and can’tdo. For instance, what is homosexuality? It is an experience, that’s all it is,a way of expressing love for another human being, another aspect of ourselves.Two men or women loving each other deeply and sexually is considered a moraloutrage, while a man and a woman hating each other and living together in amarriage they are both too frightened to end, is considered acceptable. Myphilosophy is to allow all experience as long as thePicture #200 [images/img_0200.png]Illpeople involved have made that decision from their own free-will withoutpressure or imposition of any kind.(I guess becoming a member of the Christian Moral Crusade is now out of thequestion? It is? Phew, thank goodness for that.)Creation consists of a sea of relationships. Creation is relationships therelationships between atoms, electrons, vibrational states, people, communities,countries, stars, planets, galaxies, and so on. There are also therelationships, often forgotten, between people and the rest of the Earth familylike the trees, flowers, air, water, animals, insects and the spirit of MotherEarth. So many of these relationships have become based on domination ratherthan love. Whether it is a man dominating his wife or partner (or vice versa) toimpose his views and beliefs on the relationship, or humankind seeking todominate the animals and the natural world, the picture we see is of one “side”of a relationship seeking to change and mould the other to fit in with theirview of how things should be. Of course this is not always the case, there areno absolutes, but it is overwhelmingly what I see happening. You cannot divorcethe way we view our relationships with other lifeforms on the planet from theway we view our relationships with each other. All are manifestations of thesame state of mind - a wish to impose rather than to respect and love. When westop abusing ourselves, we’ll stop abusing the planet. Marriage and partnershipsin general have become a prison of imposition and denial. The insecurity of onepartner, sometimes both, wishes to preserve its misguided sense of security bydictating the terms of the relationship with another. This leads to a “love”which says: I love you if you conform to what I believe you should be. This islight years away from: I love you whatever you say, do or think. Love in itspurest, most magical form, has no ifs or huts or maybes. Love is to desire whatis best for another, even if it is not what we wish to happen from our ownstandpoint. Love in its purest form can also step back emotionally and allowsomeone to go through a negative experience rather than protect them from alearning opportunity that will speed their understanding of life and themselves.The greatest love anyone can have for another is to let them go, if that is whatis best for them, on their journey of evolution through experience. It iscertainly to allow them, without judgement or withdrawal of love, to experiencewhatever they need to experience to speed their journey to Oneness. Love is notonly to say: I love being with you or I love to go to bed with you. Love is tolove someone so completely that nothing they can ever do could destroy the wayyouPicture #201 [images/img_0201.png]178feel about them. How many people on this planet love each other by thatdefinition of love? Exactly. We want to impose our blueprint on others and onlyif people conform to that do we love them, or rather think we love them. Needingsomeone and loving someone are not the same thing.As the consciousness of humanity continues to awaken to its full and gloriouspotential, these relationships will fade and die They reflect our old, narrowsense of self and reality, not the one we are moving into. Relationships havebeen replicas of the fear and insecurity that has swamped the human psyche forthousands of years. This insecurity has led to the prison cell marriage and thesubmission to another’s will for fear of losing them. Marriage and relationshipshave also become HassleFree Zones. We fear being alone if we express ouruniqueness because we lack self esteem and inner security. We have lost our“wholeness” because we have switched off our multidimensional selves.Relationships, like marriage, have consisted of two “halves” seeking to make awhole. The male seeks to balance himself in a relationship with a female ratherthan balancing his male-female hamiony by accessing the female within his ownpsyche. Macho man denies his female polarity and searches for that polarity in awoman. This has created relationships which suffocate and imprison rather thanset free (Figure 12a) because the partnership becomes one entity in which twohalves struggle for dominance or submit to dominance. The same applies to thewoman searching for her male polarity in a man instead of in herself. This isabout to change dramatically and, indeed, is already doing so. People who areevacuating the Hassle-Free Zones and opening themselves to theirmultidimensional wholeness do not need to secure their “other half’ in arelationship with a man or a woman. They are already whole or moving that way,thank you very much.In the face of this, relationships are going to experience a colossaltransformation. Suddenly two “wholes” will be relating to each other and once weevolve towards wholeness, balance, and completeness, there is no way we willaccept the imposition upon us of another’s blueprint. Wholeness celebrates itsuniqueness and refuses to be a clone of someone else. These new relationshipslook, symbolically, very different to those we see today (Figure 12b). Insteadof one partner dominating, both respect the other’s right to be unique. Thisrespect and acknowledgement of another’s right to be themselves and to followthe experiences that come their way creates a fantastic bond between two people.The love between them is so great, so total in its widest sense, that eachwishes the other to experience whatever they requirePicture #202 [images/img_0202.png]The Old RelationshipsPicture #203 [images/img_0203.png]One partner dominating and suffocating the uniqueness and potential of the otherOften both partners suppress each other.Figure 12aThe New RelationshipsPicture #204 [images/img_0204.png]Two whole people enjoy a tremendous bond, but both respect and encourage theother’s right to express their uniqueness and experience whatever they need toexperience.Figure 12bPicture #205 [images/img_0205.png]Picture #206 [images/img_0206.png]Picture #207 [images/img_0207.png]Picture #208 [images/img_0208.png]Picture #209 [images/img_0209.png]180to speed the journey to enlightenment, understanding and evolution. The point atwhich they meet, symbolised by the two circles in the illustration, holds amagnetic connection which is unbreakable, but they both have vast areas of theirlives in which they can express and explore their unique path and individuality.Many people will not live together and even those who do will insist on theirown “space”. This might also mean relationships, even sexual ones, with otherpeople. I’m not saying that it has to mean that, only that it can. But becausesuch people have accessed the real meaning of love and the bond between themgrows rather than diminishes, with the passage of time and experience, whateverit is. As I said earlier, I hear people talk about the need for unconditionallove and they even lecture others on how important it is. But they don’t live itthemselves. Their own love is still conditional on another person conforming totheir blueprint. My partner for 25 years, Linda, is one of the small number ofpeople I have met in my life who understands the meaning of unconditional love.She is living it, not bullshitting about it, and that makes her an astonishingwoman. Our relationship is in the process of great change and maybe we won’t betogether as we have been in the past. But the bond of love between us remainsand will always do so because the love is without condition. Whatever happens toeither of us on our journey to Oneness, that love and connection will be there,no matter what the distance between us in either miles or attitudes. People maychange, even partners may change, but unconditional love lives on, no matterwhat. Unconditional love is not some trite phrase, it is a state of being thatwill transform the world. But only if we stop just talking about it and startmeaning what we say and living what we say. Equally vital, it will only happenif we allow everyone to live unconditional love without moralising or seeking tofrighten and hassle them into conforming to the blueprint of another.GREAT EXPECTATIONSThis brings me to the greatest destroyer of relationships and a prime creator ofemotional distress: expectations. We go through our lives thinking we are livingin the present when in truth we are living in the past and the future. There arethose who believe that the past, present and future are happening at the sametime and I agree with that, but they are happening on different vibrations. Weneed to decide which of those vibrations we wish to occupy. We live in the pastbecause of the guilt and resentment we hold onto and we live in the futurebecausePicture #210 [images/img_0210.png]181we fear what is to come. Expectations also keep us, mentally and emotionally, inthe future. All the time we have expectations of what will happen, how a personwill behave, what they will do and say. Then, when that person does not react inthe way we expected, we are disappointed. We may lose our temper with them orsulk or tell our friends how disappointed we were with someone’s behaviour. Heor she was nothing like I expected, we say. But hold on just a second. It’s notthat person’s fault that they did not “come up to expectations”. They had noinput in deciding what those expectations were going to be. They were just beingthemselves, which is all anyone can be. It was the person who created theexpectations who created the subsequent disappointment. This disappointment iscaused by someone not conforming to the expectations created by someone else. Ifthere were no expectations, there would be no disappointment. And withoutexpectations we live in the present, not the future, and we enjoy each moment asit happens without destroying that enjoyment with the disappointment ofunfulfilled expectations. You go to a soccer match expecting your team to winand they don’t. You are disappointed. You go to the same soccer match just toenjoy the game with no expectations of who will win, nor any great emotionalattachment to either team, and you are not disappointed, whichever team loses.You just enjoy the game as it happens. So it is with life. Expectations =disappointment. No expectations = living each moment in that moment.Expectations also focus our minds on a very narrow area of potential experience- what we expect the experience to be. Once we let go of expectations, our mindwalks free from that limited vision of possible experience and opens itself toall possible experience. We see this phenomena in action when people go to afilm expecting not to like it and, because of that state of mind, they usuallydon’t. If, however, they had gone to the cinema with no expectations they wouldhave allowed that openness of mind to enjoy the picture because there were noexpections of unenjoyment which they were trying so hard to fulfill.If you enter a relationship with expectations, sexual or otherwise, you arealmost certainly going to be disappointed because people are not clones of ourexpectations of them. Why should they be? What arrogauce that we should demandof people that they be what we expect them to be rather than to express whatthey really are. If we love someone unconditionally, without demanding that theymeet our expectations, the relationship takes on a whole new dimension andPicture #211 [images/img_0211.png]182becomes much more stable and permanent. My symbolic representation of the newrelationships, the two circles connected at the centre, is the figure of eight -the symbol of infinity. This is appropriate because relationships founded onunconditional love with no expectations of each other are the only ones capableof infinity. The others either collapse because of unfulfilled expectations orthe suffocation of individuality, or both partners accept the suppression ofindividuality and constant disappointment because they are too frightened towalk away from their perceived “security”. Fear of the alternative is what keepsmost, yes I would say most, relationships together. However, fear diminishes onthe road to wholeness and Oneness and we are going to see an explosion ofpartnership break downs as we evolve from relationships based on conditions andexpectations to those based on unconditional love and respect for another’sright to individuality and uniqueness of experience. When we do this, we willlive each moment as it happens without determining beforehand what we expectthat moment to be and then being disappointed. We will live in the NOW not thepast or the future, and we will accept people for what they are and not for whatwe expect them to be. In the words of a Chris de Burgh song: Live every momentbefore the moment’s gone.I have realised from experience that one of the greatest obstacles to expressingour true selves is the desire not to hurt someone. We suppress our feelingsbecause we want to avoid the emotional hurt that we know our actions may bring.This is particularly applicable to relationships of all kinds. People stay inmarriages because they wish to protect their partner and children from the painof divorce, or they worry that their parents will be upset if they follow theirheart. But all this does, in the end, is to cause even more pain and distressbecause a person suppressing their real feelings and desires is at war withthemselves. Part of the psyche wants to go with the flow while another part isdesperately trying to dam the flow. The frustration and damage this createsoften manifests as simmering anger and resentment, which destroys therelationship in a much more long term and painful way than simply being honestfrom the start and saying: “It’s time to go”. At its most extreme, thesuppression of our uniqueness and the urgings within us can cause so much pentup frustration that it explodes as violence, crime, depression, illness and evensuicide. Suppressing uniqueness with a stream of rules, regulations and “moral”absolutes is supposed to protect society from violence and crime when, in fact,it isPicture #212 [images/img_0212.png]183causing them. In a world in which people are conditioned to accept such a narrowversion of “life”, there are bound to be people who are hurt and upset when weexpress our real, unconditioned selves. The alternative to that is to stay injail forever and a day. The point is this: is it your intention to hurt someone?No, of course not. You are just being you and going where your heart leads you.If you suppress that you are allowing your life to be controlled by theattitudes of another and not your own. You become a puppet on the strings ofanother person’s emotions and beliefs. It is hard to say and do things that youknow will cause hurt to someone you care for, but often you are also creating anexperience which sets them free, too. In the process of expressing your realself, you are helping to shatter their status quo prison of the mind and givethem the opportunity to regain and express their true and infinite power. Howoften do we hear people say that an experience which was traumatic in the momenthas turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to them? In this era ofchange and self re-appraisal, it is time to be honest with ourselves and honestwith others about the way we feel.For all this to happen in a harmonious way, it is necessary to let go of ouremotional dependency on each other. By that I don’t mean that we cease to lovepeople and feel wonderful when they are around. That is an incredible andblissful feeling. I mean to still be OK within ourselves when they are notaround. That is not easy in a world conditioned by theguilt-resentment-fear-expectation view of relationships, but it is possible ifyou are prepared to work through the initial and understandable pain in thetransition period. And as we attract to us what we most fear, if we don’t let goof the fear of losing another, we will lose them. Only in that way can weexperience that loss, find our own inner strength and self esteem to stand aloneif necessary, and let go of that fear. When we release the fear of being alone,we will no longer be alone because the lesson will have been learned and theevolution achieved. That’s the idea behind creating our own reality growth, notpunishment. The only person who punishes us is ourselves. Untying our emotionaldependency on another person or lifestyle, is to stop taking on other people’sproblems. We tend to lock into the emotional ups and downs of each other. Whenone partner is depressed or wound up, the other starts to feel the same. But allthat creates is two people feeling depressed rather than one. What good is that?What is making one person feel down is their own problem and it is for them tosort out. Also, people emerge from their emotionalPicture #213 [images/img_0213.png]184traumas far more quickly when those close to them stay “up” instead of taking onthe emotions of their partners and loved ones. Other people’s emotional problemsare not yours, they are the creation of the person involved no matter what thecircumstances. That means only they can sort them out. If we take on theiremotional states, we actually hinder rather than help them to emerge throughthat emotional mire. If you stay independent from people emotionally you will bein a better position to give them what they most need in those circumstances.,love in its truest and widest sense. I am having some t-shirts produced whichsay:“Piss off. I’m having a bad day... don’t take it personally.”That’s a key to harmony in relationships of all kinds, whether it be a marriageor parents or people at work. When people act towards us in ways we don’t like,they are expressing their sense of self at that moment and they are mirroringback at us something that we can address and leam from. It’s a movie playing toan ever changing and evolving script. You can love all the other actors in themovie without taking over their parts or reading their lines. Don’t take itpersonally. It is never personal. It is always someone dealing with their ownemotional garbage which far from relating directly to you may go back thousandsof years. You are just the trigger for that suppressed emotion and others aretriggers for you. Let’s get out of the Earthly personality and into the eternityof it all. However people behave towards us or anyone else, just love them. Themore negatively they act, the more love they are crying out for. We don’t haveto approve of their actions to love them. Yet what do we do? We give our love tothose who conform to our blueprint, our expectations, and deny love to those whodon’t. As almost no-one conforms to that blueprint we truly love almost no-one,usually no-one. Because others are insisting that we conform to theirblueprints, almost no-one, usually no-one, truly loves us. This is why the worldis so short of love. Everyone is laying down the conditions for it. We’ll havelawyers producing contracts which say “I promise to love you in return for thefollowing...”. Love is about loving without conditions of any kind. Love isnever, never, never about the possession and ownership of another mind, body,emotion or spirit. Love is independent from emotional ties which diminish lovein its greatest and most unconditional form. Only without that emotionaldependence can love give us what we need to experience and notPicture #214 [images/img_0214.png]185necessarily what we want to experience. In my first book on these subjects, TheTruth Vibrations, I quoted a channelled2 message which sums up all that I havesaid here about love and relationships:“True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, butit will always give that which is best for it. So welcome everything you receivewhether you like it or not. Ponder on anything you do not like and see if youcan see why it was necessary. Acceptance will then be very much easier. ”Love is to become independent of someone emotionally to the point where you canhelp them experience what they need to experience to speed their evolution toOneness. What we have called “love” in this world has often been the veryopposite of that definition. It has sought to deny experience, not to encourageit; to possess, not to set free; to ex-pect, not to re-spect. A re-evaluation oflove is emerging to sweep away the limitations and launch us into limitlessness.After all, those limits are of our own making. If we didn’t create them, theycould not exist.What I have said in this chapter is fundamentally different to the views of sexand relationships which you will hear in what we call “society” - theHassle-Free Zone. Many will think that what I say is a moral outrage because thethought of people loving each other unconditionally, including sexuallysometimes, is outrageous to moralists and those who take their off-the-pegopinions from them. But that sense of outrage speaks volumes about the state ofbeing of the moralist, not my own. I believe in allowing people to be what theyare, to leam, and to evolve to something greater. I believe that people can lovemore than one person, even physically, at the same time and that the energycalled love is without limits. The flow of love can never run dry. Whether weexpress it or suppress it is merely a choice that we all make in every moment.The right to love and be loved is in our own minds and our own hearts. Love ison tap whenever we choose. It is2 Channelling is when someone tones their consciousness to another wavelength ofreality and becomes the vibrational bridge between that wavelength and this one.Thought fields are sent from a higher wavelength through the “medium” or“channeller” who turns those thought fields into spoken or written words. It isa means for one dimension to communicate with another. Some channelling producesinspired information, some a load of old nonsense. It depends on the levels withwhich the channeller is communicating and how skillfully they can suppress theirown personality and thoughts to allow the information to come through in theform that it was sent.Picture #215 [images/img_0215.png]186only a choice. If saying all that is an outrage, then I guess I must beoutrageous. Good.The abuse and denial of love and its physical expression have done seriousdamage to human evolution. It has suppressed and imbalanced the kundalini and indoing so it has delinked us from our true sexual, intellectual, emotional andspiritual potential. The imbalanced, uncontrolled power of the kundalini, causedby fear, guilt and denial, has also led to sexual abuse, aggression, hatred,suicide, inner conflict and global war. It has been like trying to stop a flowof water by pressing your thumb against the tap. The water spurts everywhere,out of control. So it is, symbolically, with the kundalini when you try to holdback its natural, God-given flow. This has scrambled the human psyche when, ifit is allowed to flow naturally and without emotional hindrance, the kundalinihas the potential to take us home to multidimensional Oneness. Relax. What youare and what you do needs no excuses. Only when we grow up as a human race, andstop dictating to each other what we should be, do, say and experience, willpeople begin to relax with themselves and have the inner peace to allow thekundalini to do its work without fear of the experiences that will bring.And we can grow up now, today, this second. Like everything else, it’s only achoice.Picture #216 [images/img_0216.png]187Chapter 10The Past Is Over - GoodbyeWe stand on the threshold of the most incredible change. Nothing and no-one willbe the same again. We can flow with it and go with it, or we can cling to oursense of programmed security. Either way, it’s going to happen. It is happening.The past is over. It’s time to move on.Most people have forgotten how long we have all worked for this. We have playedour parts as goodies and baddies, victors, victims and villains, and we havelearned so much about the consequences of separation. We crave once again for areturn to the Oneness we remember deep in our consciousness, a memory that makesso much more painful and frustrating the world we observe today. We turn todrugs and booze to shut out that pain and to escape all too briefly from theemotional turmoil that separation has created. Deep inside we know what ispossible and it hurts to see how far we have fallen into the pit of ignorance.Most don’t feel this consciously, of course, but that is the foundation of theemotional distress that plagues the human heart.Come on, gang. We can do better than this. What are we doing hanging aroundhere? We’ve got a home to go to and it’s called paradise.We have reached the point in the cycle of evolution within the multiscreencinema when a fantastic shift is taking place. The Third and Fourth Dimensionsof consciousness are merging into the Fifth Dimension. It is like a ladder beingpulled up until, eventually, the whole vortex/pyramid returns to Oneness. Thestructure which creates each of the dimensions is an energy “net” or “web”called a matrix (Figure 13 overleaf). You might think of it as the steelstructure of a building. The multiscreen cinema is a series of matrixesinterconnecting with each other. The whole “building” (vortex) is one matrix andso is each dimension, galaxy, solar system, universe, and planet within thatPicture #217 [images/img_0217.png]Picture #218 [images/img_0218.png]Picture #219 [images/img_0219.png]189overall structure. The human body is also a matrix and the energy lines of thebody matrix provide the basis of the ancient healing art of acupuncture. Againyou could relate this matrix structure to those Russian dolls, one inside theother, with the biggest one encompassing all of them. The matrix energy web setsthe format and nature of each dimension, universe, galaxy, solar system andplanet, and everything that exists within them. It is a gigantic thought formcreated by Oneness. It’s the movie screen, if you like. The matrix is theblueprint, the “computer program, which creates and holds together thisthreedimensional world and interconnects with all the other matrix levels. Whena matrix changes, everything within it changes, and our matrix is changing...now! In fact they all are, on every level of the vortex and we are heading for afantastic multidimensional galactic orgasm.A matrix is the collective mind of all that exists on each dimension and so itis with every level. The Earth matrix, for example, is the collective mind ofall that exists on this planet. It is the collective mind of humanity. Ourthoughts are absorbed by the matrix “computer” and at that level all that hashappened on the Earth is recorded and stored. This is one source of the socalled Akashic Records which many psychics access when they are recalling pastevents and past lives. They are tuning their consciousness to the vibratory“library”, the matrix, which holds that information. I guess this could be anorigin of the ancient idea of “God” recording our every move. Sure beats anotebook. The matrix is also a source of information for the “prophets” andpsychics, ancient and modem, who “see” the future. It is not the future thatwill definitely be. It is the future that will be if we don’t change. Eachmatrix mind takes all information available, including current human attitudesand behaviour, and projects forward how the future will turn out on currenttrends. This is the “future” which people like Nostradamus and others haveconnected with. It exists as a thought field created by a matrix mind. Thefuture is not set in concrete. If we change, it changes, because we create thefuture reality as we create our present reality. Our thoughts and attitudes areaffecting the Earth matrix and, through that, affecting the thoughts andattitudes of everyone connected to the matrix - all of us. You could see itsymbolically as everyone connected to a computer program and each of us slightlyrewriting that program with each thought, word, and action. Researchers havedocumented the “hundredth monkey syndrome” which very much relates to the matrixstructure. They have shown that once a certain number of a species has beentaughtPicture #220 [images/img_0220.png]190something new, suddenly all or most of that species can do the same purely by“inspiration” and without being shown. How does this happen? Simple. A fewmembers of a species leam something new until the critical mass point is reachedwhere the sum total of their knowledge is powerful enough within the matrix forthe rest of the species to access the information. As a result they “know” howto do something without being shown. This appears to be a mystery, but it isn’t.They are tuning into the matrix, the collective mind.This process can also affect us negatively of course and the Earth matrix hasbecome a prison of programmed, imbalanced thought. The Earth matrix has longbeen dominated by the herd mentality and other classic human reactions andresponses explored in this book, because so many “individual” minds have chosento think like that. This can be self-perpetuating because the matrix absorbsthis mentality and then feeds those attitudes back to the human race. It has setin motion a cycle of individual minds thinking limitation, which together createa sense of limitation in the collective mind, the Earth matrix, which then ffedslimitation of thought back to human minds, which then think in even more limitedterms, which then., you get the idea. The Earth matrix has become a globaleggshell which has closed down the channels to other levels and dimensions ofcreation. It has been like living in a vibrational box with the lid locked down.This is the process through which humanity has become stuck in a rut ofintergenerational non-thinking and desperately limited vision. Billions ofpeople who choose not to think for themselves become dominated by the deeplyingrained patterns held within the Earth matrix. In effect, the matrix mindthinks for them. They are its robots and they have been able to live out anentire physical lifetime without having a single thought that originated withthem. Patterns of fear, guilt, resentment, judgment and low self esteem arerepeated generation after generation in this way. It is the symbolic recordneedle stuck in the groove. This has been the consequence of the cycle oflimitation looping between human minds and the Earth matrix mind. That is thecycle we are now in the process of breaking. With every mind that opens and seeslife in a new way, the matrix mind is affected. Eventually there comes the pointof critical mass, the hundredth monkey, when enough people have changed theirattitudes and sense of reality to “switch” the Earth matrix reality fromlimitation to limitlessness, from can’t to can, from wanna-be to gonnabe. Atthat point the global reality is transformed and the vibrational rate begins toclimb rapidly up the octave scale. We evolve very, veryPicture #221 [images/img_0221.png]191quickly because the global eggshell has gone. Oneness here we come. How do wechange the world? We change ourselves.What has happened to the human race has happened to the Earth matrix. It hasclosed its mind and lost its most powerful connection with the solar systemmatrix centred on the Sun, and certainly with the galaxy matrix and the onegoverning the entire Third Dimension. This has been caused by all the mental andemotional gunge that has swamped the Earth matrix mind. As a result of this, ithas acted a little like a dam, holding back from most human consciousness allthat exists beyond the dense physical reality. Some people on the planet haveexpanded their consciousness to access levels beyond the Earth matrix and atthat point they see life with a totally different perspective. The prison dooropens. But for the overwhelming majority of people, they are accessing only theEarth matrix with all its limitation of thought and emotional sewage. Just asthe human subconscious needs to be cleansed of its emotional crap, so does theEarth matrix. Indeed the two are the same. The Earth will therefore be releasingher pent up emotions in the same way that humanity is now doing so. Strap in andhold tight! The shift is hitting the fan! It is the emotional imbalances in theEarth matrix which has made it so much more difficult to connect with ourmultidimensional selves. When all the matrix levels are in powerful connection,it means that to tune to one is to tune to all. Connecting with the Earth matrixoffers the potential for your consciousness to be as big as the Earth. But when,as will happen again, the Earth matrix is powerfully connected to the solarsystem matrix, and it with the galaxy matrix, and so on, we have the potentialfor our minds to be as big as Creation. In ... and the truth shall set you freeI spoke of the probability that the Earth was trapped in some sort of vibratoryprison which was detaching us from our infinity of knowledge, understanding andlove. That vibratory concentration camp is the Earth matrix and I feel thatmanipulation from elements in the Fourth Dimension have conspired to bring thisabout. When the present Earth matrix is replaced by a new grid during ourlifetimes, WOW! Our minds will expand so rapidly we will need a seat beltbecause we will then find it so much easier to connect with the higher matrixlevels, too. Symbolically the human mind and sense of perspective is expandingfrom the size of a pea to that of a hot air balloon - and then some.Across the planet today are millions of people working to change the thoughtpatterns in the present Earth matrix and to introduce the newPicture #222 [images/img_0222.png]192one for the next era of human evolution. Sometimes this involves going tocertain points on the Earth’s surface, many, though certainly not all, of whichare the places held sacred since ancient times. These include stone circles,mounds, hills, mountains and pre-Christian Earthworks which are sited at chakraand “acupuncture” points on the Earth matrix. Peoples of thousands of years agoknew far more about the cycles and structure of life than do theletters-after-your-name scientists of today. The sacred sites, as they are oftencalled, are points on the network of energy lines around and through the planetwhich have become known as ley lines or meridians. Acupuncture involves puttingtiny needles at certain points on the meridian lines of energy that circle thehuman body. This balances the flow of energy and so keeps us free fromdisharmony, dis-ease. The same basic principle applies to the Earth. She has agrid of energy lines, acupuncture, and chakra points, at which people can becomewalking, talking, “acupuncture needles” and affect enomious changes in thebalance and imbalance of the energy flow within the Earth matrix. The fourthdimensional manipulators have inspired the destruction of so many major pointson the grid with the siting of cities, power stations, roads and battlefields.The Cult of the All Seeing Eye systematically arranges black magic rituals onthese sites to fill them with negative energy. They know that if they can holddown the vibration of the grid and imbalance it negatively this will ensure thathumanity as a whole is operating within the “Satanic” frequency range. Thisdelinks people from their multidimensional selves and makes them so easy toclose down, control and manipulate. The Earth matrix has been reduced to tattersand as we constantly interact with this grid without realising it, the negative,imbalanced energy flows this has created have fundamentally affected humanthought. This is one reason for the mysterious crop fomiations or “circles”which increased dramatically after the end of the 1980s. Some have been hoaxedto divert our attention from the genuine patterns and the realisation that theyare harbingers of enormous change. The crop formations are created by a higherintelligence using magnetic energy and the symbols they represent can often becharted back to the ancient world. A symbol, a pattern, is also energy, as iseverything. These formations often appear on ley lines and on, or close to,Earth energy points. They are stimulating and winding up the power in the grid,the Earth matrix, and raising its vibration. Also they disperse blockages inthat flow.The positive elements of the Fourth Dimension and those even higher,particularly the Fifth, are working to coordinate and guide thePicture #223 [images/img_0223.png]193transformation of humanity and the Earth. The new grid has been created on ahigher dimension and it needs to be “grounded” in this one to replace the oldgrid controlled by the Cult of the All Seeing Eye. The transformation in fact,is the introduction of this new matrix. The new grid has been created with heartenergy - pure love - and it can only be grounded by human beings vibratingwithin this frequency range known as love. When people open their hearts andallow their unconditional love to flow, they lock in vibrationally to thisenergy field and “earth” it in this Third Dimension in much the same way aslightning is earthed by people and trees. More and more people are awakening totheir higher guidance, opening their hearts and following their intuition toenergy sites, the acupuncture points on the Earth’s surface. They then allowthemselves to be used as channels to ground the new love grid at those points.As this progresses - and it’s already well advanced - the Global Elite’s controlof the world will cease to be because their power to do it will be gone.Everything is electrical and magnetic energy. It is only that some things aremore powerfully electrical and magnetic than others. Quartz crystals, forinstance, are especially sensitive and powerful and this is why you findquartz-based stones used for stone circles around the world. The ancients,probably with extraterrestrial inspiration, knew what they were doing. Theydidn’t choose those stones at random, they understood at least the basis of whatthey could do. Quartz can store and transmit energy and act as a receiver forenergy frequencies. Research has also shown that at least the vast majority ofstanding stones and circles are built on or very close to faults on the Earth’ssurface which produce particular electrical and magnetic effects. Of the 286stone circles in Britain, 235 are built on rocks more than 250 million yearsold, the statistical chances of which are in excess of a million to one.1 MostUFO sightings are made on or very close to stone circles and other sacred sitesand ley lines. Many people believe that this is because of the electrical andmagnetic “fuel” they provide for these interdimensional craft, but it could alsobe that the electromagnetic effects of ley lines and power points increasepsychic awareness and make it easier to “see” what we call UFOs on otherdimensions and wavelengths. So you can see that the plundering of the1 Serena Roney-Dougal, Wlicee Science And Magic Meet, (Element Books,Shaftsbury, England, 1991) pi 56-157. This is an excellent book which shows how“paranormal” phenomena can be explained scientifically once scientists let go oftheir fundamentally flawed “laws” of physics and their obsession withthis-world-is-all-there-is.Picture #224 [images/img_0224.png]194Earth for rocks, crystals and minerals, is not only damaging physically, it isdisastrously rewiring the planet by moving and destroying the natural energystores, transmitters and receivers. These rocks, crystals and minerals are notwhere they are for their health - they are there to play their roles in theelectromagnetic balance of the Earth’s energy field, our energy field.The power of the energy waxes and wanes as the seasons and planetary influencesaffect the Earth’s magnetic field, thus the ancients had their ceremonies tocelebrate different points in nature’s cycle of birth and death, the ups anddowns of the energy field. Sun rise and Sun set are powerful times because oftheir effect on the energies. The Moon, especially full Moon, affects peoplebecause of its magnetic effect on the Earth’s energy field and humanconsciousness. This is how it draws the tides in and out. A friend used to havea migraine headache on every full Moon until she made the connection. Sheconcluded that her consciousness was being “pulled” out of her body by theeffect of the full Moon magnetism. She went outside in bare feet to make astrong magnetic connection with the Earth (no rubber soles) and the headacheimmediately disappeared. When you touch a standing stone or any rock, indeedanything, you are making an electrical and magnetic contact which allows the twoway exchange of energy to occur. This is what is happening with hands on healingand, of course, sex. Sick people have been shown to have diminished power intheir energy fields while the best healers have extremely powerful fields.Alternative healing methods, psychic phenomena, dreams, strange sounds or lightsin the sky, stone circles, crops circles, pyramids, and an endless list of other“mysteries” are all caused or inspired by electrical and magnetic energy fieldsand their relationship and interaction with each other across the dimensions ofconsciousness. People accept that lightning exists because they can see it. Butthat is merely an electromagnetic phenomena happening within the frequency rangeof our physical senses. “Paranormal” phenomena are only the same principle atwork on wavelengths that our physical senses often can’t see or feel, but ourhigher psychic senses can. The knowledge of how to access this infiniteelectromagnetic power for free energy is already available, but the technologyis being suppressed by the Global Elite who control the global fossil fuelindustry.The current transformation of human consciousness is being inspired by energiesintroduced to the Earth’s electrical and magnetic fields the Earth matrix. Theseare increasing the vibrational state of the globalPicture #225 [images/img_0225.png]195energy field. This must affect human consciousness because we are part of thatfield and it must affect weather patterns, etc, which are also an expression ofthat field. It is all very simple. The positive elements in the FourthDimension, and higher, are working with those millions of humans who have openedtheir minds to this knowledge to make the transformation of the global energyfield as smooth as possible. These people have been guided by higher dimensionsof themselves to repair the old energy grid and, at the same time, help to“ground” the new one in this dimension. The plan is to raise the vibrationalrate of the Earth to the limits of the old grid and then switch in the new. Itis the same principle as switching from one computer program to another. Ideallythis is a smooth process, like lock gates on a canal. The vibrational rate ofthe energy flowing through the ley line network is raised to the highest levelof the old grid; the symbolic lock gates then open; and the switch is made tothe lowest level of the new grid. From that point, the vibratory levels of thenew grid will be gradually wound up as human consciousness expands and is ableto take that power of energy without being mentally and physically blown away.However, because of what has happened, this is no ideal situation. The old gridhas been in such a state that there is a gap between the highest vibrations itis capable of taking and the lowest levels of the new one. At switchover timethere will be a sudden vibrational “jump” across this gap which could send shockwaves through the Earth, very much like a sudden surge of electricity throughyour electrical system at home. Fuses may blow! How big that vibrational leaphas to be depends once again upon us. Are we going to heal the grid with love orfurther diminish it with conflict? Are we going to speak our truth so thatothers may hear or are we going to stay in the shadows and hide how we feelthrough fear and insecurity? We are back to our old friend - choice.Speaking and thinking your tmth is vital to this transformation. Every time youthink in ways that challenge the limitations, you are transferring thatknowledge to the Earth matrix and making another step towards critical mass.When you speak in public, your words and thoughts are also absorbed by the Earthmatrix and, more than that, they offer the audience the chance to hear theinformation. This opens their minds to reject their sense of limitation andtheir thoughts also add to critical mass. It’s the same with books. The processgets quicker and quicker and this is happening today. For many years I have beentravelling Britain, and increasingly the world, talking of these thingsPicture #226 [images/img_0226.png]196and after a while I noticed how often my apparently “random” speaking venueswere positioned on, or very close to, acupuncture and chakra points on the leyline network of the Earth matrix. This is because, like an acupuncture needle,when words and thoughts are created at these points, they enter the matrix verypowerfully and they pass around the planet on the global energy network. In thisway, words spoken at a point in Scotland can affect someone living in China.That knowledge becomes available, via the matrix, to the guy living in Peking.Of course he won’t stand there accessing every word of the speech, likelistening to the radio. It will be more in the form of an “inspired” thought ora sudden questioning of the status quo. If you simply stand and project thoughtsof love, as a group or by yourself, the same effect applies. This is theprinciple which allows telepathy to happen - the reading of another person’sthought fields. You think love in New York, you think love to the world. We areall One.The global energy network has a central point, a heart, which pumps the energyaround the spiritual veins and arteries of the Earth. This is, obviously, thepoint where you can most effectively change planetary consciousness. That heartat the present time is, I believe, in the British Isles and the Republic ofIreland. I feel this heart centre will move to the United States when the newmatrix structure switches in. By then the US will be a very different place tothe one we see today. The system as we know it, the one typified by a culture ofmass consumption developed in the United States, will be rapidly collapsing.Within our generation we will reach critical mass, the moment when the Earthmatrix - the collective mind of humanity - switches from limitation to infinity,from fear to love. We are hurtling towards it now Not only are vastly more mindsand hearts opening, energies of unimaginable power are filtering down fromOneness into this timespace dimension to transform the nature of thought andreality here. These energies and changing human consciousness are affectingglobal weather patterns and will, quite probably, lead to unprecedented (inmodern times) geological activity. Vibrational codes are also being emitted fromthe Sun to challenge the limitations of the Earth consciousness. These codes arepicked up by the chakras of the Earth and the human body and they are makingsubtle changes to our thinking and our DNA, the body’s genetic library andcontrol centre. The Third and Fourth Dimensions of consciousness are merging andas the transformation proceeds, these will in turn merge with the FifthDimension. Three separated levels of us will become One and ourPicture #227 [images/img_0227.png]197perceptions of life and self are heading for an unbelievable change. People withthe most fixed and programmed attitudes will change in ways that would seemimpossible now. I have seen this trend so often in the people I meet on speakingtours and at workshops, and in the thousands of letters from around the world.This transformation of consciousness knows no boundaries of race, colour, creed,or income bracket. It recognises no “chosen ones” or “chosen peoples”. It isthere for everyone and everything. All it requires is for us to open our mindsand open our hearts. In other words, to open the door on our mental andemotional prison, to shatter the eggshell around us, and allow in the energiesthat will set us free. That means evacuating the HassleFree Zones, letting go offear, guilt, resentment and judgment, and celebrating our right, and everyone’sright, to be unique. This is a time to be joyous. We’re going home. We arereturning to multidimensional Oneness and we are being drawn to our vibrational“home” on Planet Earth. This will involve changes of location, even countries,for many people as the eggshell cracks.There is no need to allow the magnitude of it all to stimulate fear or panic.You are an incredible aspect of multidimensional consciousness. You are capableof anything. People talk about the time of the apocalypse as if it is all deathand destruction. But when you take the word apocalypse back to the Greeklanguage from whence it was translated, it means something very different: thedisclosure, the uncovering, the revealing. That is exactly what is happeningnow. What we are experiencing and will experience is part of the natural cycleof learning and evolution. We live forever and we leam forever. There’s nothingto fear. A friend of mine, Jack Watters, put it very well when he wrote:“Nobody panics when the Sun goes down at night. We know it comes up again in themorning. Nobody patties in the season of falling leaves, we know there’ll beanother Spring. If we didn’t know about Spring we ’d probably tty and supergluethe leaves back on the trees. If they should be green then better to paint outthe russet, copper, and gold of Autumn.“If we understand a game, we know where it starts and where it finishes. Byforgetting the point of the game - in the playing of it - we lose the how, whenand why offinishing it. By forgetting the point of the game we forget about thenatural transitions which end it, resolve it, and transform it. How and whenwere we going to finish this unusual,Picture #228 [images/img_0228.png]198planetary improvisation of ours? Whenever would we let one cycle go to replaceit with another? Or would we, in the depths of our misunderstanding, keepinventing bigger, better glue? ” 1 2And that’s what we have done. Humanity has had such a fear of new experience, ifthe experience is at odds with the view of the HassleFree Zone, that we haveclung to status quos of all kinds as our sense of personal security. We wouldrather expend massive amounts of emotion and energy supergluing together thesematchstick structures, than allowing them to collapse and using our energy tocreate something better. What’s that we say? Better the devil you know than thedevil you don’t. Nonsense. If our reality is devils, we will create them, but wedon’t have to. We can create paradise without if we can find paradise within.So how does all that I have outlined in this chapter affect us now as we headrapidly into the 21st century?To complete the immense consciousness shift now upon us, we are looking forbalance. Positive-negative balance, male-female balance, physical-spiritualbalance. Anything that makes us imbalanced we are being challenged to unload. Weare attracting to ourselves experiences which give us the opportunity to faceour imbalances and move through them to harmony. This will raise ourconsciousness, increase it’s vibratory rate, and allow us through the “QuantumGate”, the top of that symbolic bottle. Hello everyone. I’m home! The immenseemotional cleansing that is taking place, indeed has been taking placethroughout the 20th century, is potentially catastrophic for everyday life inthe short term - if we continue to believe this movie is “real”. If, however, wesee each other as actors playing parts which help us to face ourselves andunload emotional baggage, this period of emotional cleansing and consciousnessrebalancing will be far less traumatic, because we won’t take on yet more guiltand resentment with each new experience. It’s up to us. We need to remember thatwe are not our emotional crap. That is not “us”. We are the eternal vessel thathas become filled with emotional crap. We are emptying the vessel and giving ita polish. Look at it. It’s beautiful.The incredible population increases since the last century are due to theincarnation of billions of souls arriving to face the experiences in1 Jack Watters, Transformation: The Plan For A Quantum Shift Of Consciousness.Publishedas an information paper in 1996.Picture #229 [images/img_0229.png]199the three dimensional world, which they hope will clear their emotionalimbalances built up over countless incarnations, and set their consciousnessfree to fly through the Quantum Gate. To reach the vibrational levels necessaryto pass through that “gate”, we need to ditch the emotional weights that arevibrationally holding us down. If my own experience and that of so many othersis anything to go by, whatever we are attached to emotionally to the point whereit becomes a crutch, will be taken away until we let go of that attachment.People with a crutch walk with a limp and we don’t have time for that. We needto run. If you have an emotional attachment to money, if it is your sense ofsecurity, it is likely you will lose it. If you have an emotional attachment toa person to the extent that you are emotionally dependent on them, it is likelyyou will lose them. And remember it is higher levels of ourselves that aremaking this happen, because if our lower levels don’t shift, the higher levelscan’t either. You don’t have to lose anything or anyone you love so long as youlove them unconditionally and without emotional dependency. Be in balance and atpeace with yourself. Let go of emotional dependency and you won’t need to facethe experience of losing something or someone because you will already havelearned the lessons such an experience is designed to offer.The cleansing also includes dealing with each new imbalance as it happens. Thisis what you might call instant karma. It is no good ditching the imbalances ofcenturies and then adding new ones today. It would be like one person emptyingthe bowl while another continues to fill it up. So we will find that what we putout comes back to us very quickly to allow us to constantly face our imbalancesand disperse them. One of the interesting aspects of this dense, separated worldis that the process of cause and effect often happened quite slowly. The “karma”for an action may not have rebounded on that person until another incarnation.As the frequency quickens, the period between cause and effect is gettingshorter, until at some point it will literally be instant. Time itself isgetting faster as more people are noticing. If we don’t simplify our lives andtake periods to rest, we will be in danger of burning out. Time as we know it inthis three dimensional world moves at a certain speed. It is an energy likeeverything. How fast time appears to pass depends on how our vibratory raterelates to the vibratory rate of “time”. If you stand still in a 50 mile an hourwind, your hair is blown all over the place. But if you were moving at the samespeed as the wind, all around you would be calm. As thePicture #230 [images/img_0230.png]200vibrations of this dimension quicken, our relationship to “time” is changing andone aspect of this is that time appears to pass quicker. This will become moreobvious every year. The changes in our relation to “time” will help ussynchronise with its natural flow. For instance, our natural cosmic time keepersare cycles of the Moon, not the human clock. The manipulation andmisrepresentation of time has been crucial to the imbalancing of the humanpsyche and its imprisonmeent in the Third Dimensional reality. The cycle ofnature and the cosmos relates to the 13 cycles of the Moon, each lasting 28days. These 13 Moon cycles are the natural year. This is the true flow of timeand you can see this in the woman’s 28 day menstrual cycle. But then in 1572came the edict by Pope Gregory which introduced the Gregorian calendar with itsillogical year of 12 uneven months based on the Sun (male) and not the Moon(female). This 12 months, 60 minute, 60 second system goes back to the ancientEgyptians and Babylonians and it has become the accepted measurement of “time”throughout the world. The trouble is that it is out of sync with natural time,cosmic time, and because we have tuned our minds to this Gregorian system we areout of sync with the rhythm of nature. This has delinked us from nature andlocked us into the manufactured rhythm of materialism. No wonder we treat theenvironment as we do. We are delinked from it. We urgently need to retuneourselves to the 13 Moon, 28 day cycle, especially men who do not have themenstrual rhythm to help them. As we increase our vibratory speed during theconsciousness shift we will eventually pass through time as it is measured inthe three dimensional world and enter natural time or a sense of timelessness.This is a state that people access during meditation and other quiet,daydreaming moments when the conscious mind is still.Another aspect of the quantum jump is that more people are unlocking theirpsychic senses. For most people these have been closed down by fear and theconstant ridicule and condemnation of the centuries by religion and “science”with regard to psychic powers. The last thing the manipulators of the FourthDimension have desired is for humanity to be aware, en masse, of ourmultidimensional potential. Persuading us to switch off our psychic channels wasessential to this. Stories of evil spirits, demons and witches were designed tofrighten us into denying our ability to communicate with other levels anddimensions. It is true that some very misguided consciousness exists onfrequencies close to this one, which is why some “channelled” information bypsychics is so low grade or manipulating. Black magic,Picture #231 [images/img_0231.png]201voodoo, etc, have harnessed these highly imbalanced levels of negativelydominated energies. But those levels are also being cleansed by the quantumshift and if you can raise your consciousness to beyond that frequency, you canbegin to access knowledge and information that offers a far greater insight intothe nature of life and what is going on here. Dammit, we are supposed tocommunicate with other levels and dimensions. That is our natural state. It isas natural as the Sun and the stars, the air and sky. It was when we closed offthose channels that we entered the vibratory prison cell and the movement ofpopulations into vast cities of electromagnetic technology which pollute theEarth’s magnetic energy field has made a connection even more difficult. Eventhen, everyone continues to “channel” information from the Earth matrix withoutrealising it. Where does our inspired knowledge come from that leads us tocertain discoveries or inventions? We channel it from higher levels. We don’thave to close our eyes and go into “is anybody there?” mode - knock once foryes. We simply access an inspired thought which appears to be our own, but infact conies from a matrix consciousness or a higher dimension of ourselves. Weare psychic channels whether we know it or whether we don’t. The only questionis: what level of consciousness can our psychic senses access? The more we openour minds and hearts and let go of the emotional backpack, the higher that levelwill be.The consciousness shift will communicate itself in all kinds of psychic effectsand symbols of change. People will see, hear and sense other levels beyond thephysical; we will enjoy vivid dreams from our nightly journeys to otherdimensions of consciousness which we will clearly remember and we will sensewhat is going to happen before it does; we will see ever increasing UFO andextraterrestrial activity and amazing crop formations as our dimension mergeswith theirs. The vibrational barriers between other dimensions and this one arerapidly dispersing and so much knowledge is pouring into this three dimensionalreality through our psychic channels. But, as with everything, it is importantnot to accept any information, psychic or otherwise, on face value. Does it feelright and make sense to you? No? Then reject it, whatever the source, and thatincludes what you read in this book.The re-emergence of the feminine to balance the excesses of the masculine is atthe heart of the transformation and the establishment of balance. Thesuppression of the feminine energy has created a male gender, and many femalestoo, who are left brain dominated. That isPicture #232 [images/img_0232.png]202the part of the brain that manifests the masculine “rational” aspect of us. Itis the part that says: “I’ll only believe it when I can see, hear, taste, smelland touch it”. In contrast, the right brain manifests our feminine, intuitive,psychic levels. The right brain represents I Am Me, I Am Free, and the leftbrain is home to Oh My God. The brain is the computer which allows the eternalconsciousness to work through a dense physical body and so it reflects thedomination of the male over the female within the lower levels of our eternalself. In the same way, we only use a maximum of 20% of our brains because we areonly accessing a fraction of the potential of our multidimensionalconsciousness. As we use more of our consciousness, we will use more of ourbrains, and as we balance our inner self we will balance the brain between leftand right, rational and intuitive. It is the suppression of our female energywhich closed off our psychic channels from their true potential and without thebalance of the female polarity, the male energy has run amok. The return of thefemale, the nurturing, intuitive energy, will bring back into harmony andwholeness the separation caused by the extremes of the male. But its replacementwith the domination of female over male would be just another disharmony. It isbalance that we are searching for, within ourselves and the world in general.The freeing of the female energy will show itself in more women in positions ofinfluence and a very different kind of man. Macho man is going to become a relicof history, a museum piece. He will be put there by the emerging male-femaleman: whole person man. Without the macho aspect of the male energy (which youalso see in many females), the world created by extreme male energy must crumblebecause its foundations are disappearing. They are going to be balanced out ofexistence. For a while many men may feel lost and without a sense of identity asmacho man departs, but don’t worry and stick with it. A much better futureawaits you as a whole person. Different, yes, but better.The divisions in the world may seem to be growing rather than diminishing, butthis is the healing crisis - the break down of the old so the new can emerge.The old was created by a thought pattern which conceded its uniqueness to a herdmentality. As we take our power back, the thought form which held the old worldtogether is disappearing and its physical reflection must therefore disappear aswell. A new thought pattern is preparing to take over - one that believes infreedom, tme freedom, for all and by all. Its physical reflection will bedramatically different to what we observe today. I have heard people say that ifwe all expressed our uniqueness there would be chaos. I beg one’s pardonPicture #233 [images/img_0233.png]203here. Chaos? Have you seen the news or read the papers or seen the blank eyesand faces in the street? We have chaos now in this programmed dictatorship thatwe dare to call “life”. There may well be chaos, or apparently so, in thetransition period as the old falls apart and the new begins to emerge. But thisis only the natural consequence of any status quo being replaced very quickly.What will follow in a world of true freedom will be anything but chaos. Theworld we see today is the creation overwhelmingly of a tiny part of ourmultidimensional consciousness. We try to overcome the suppression of ourpsychic and intuitive levels by using phones and filofaxes, and sitting throughendless meetings to “organise” things. But this “organisation” is happening on avery shallow level. It relates to the conscious self which is constantlybattered by conditioning messages through the eyes and ears. Compared with ourmultidimensional self, the conscious self isn’t terribly bright. Yet this is theconsciousness that “organises” our lives and societies today. Explains a lot,eh?Look at the alternative. When we deprogram ourselves and shatter the eggshell ofconditioned thought, perception, and responses, we fly beyond the delusions ofthe Earth matrix and reconnect with our multidimensional self (Figure 14overleaf). This gives us access to knowledge and wisdom beyond our imaginationand it this multilevel self that will ensure that our lives are not ruled bychaos in the incredible future that awaits us. Already, for those who are opento greater possibilities, these levels speak powerfully to us through ourintuition. The intuition comes to us from levels of consciousness outside thelimitations of Oh My God. When we flow with our intuition, we move beyondthought and into feeling. We go beyond what we know as mind - we get out of ourheads and into our hearts. Unlike our thoughts, we can often find it impossibleto describe what we feel in mere words. It is a knowingness, a sensitivity fromoutside the realms of human language. It is said that as a rale women are moreintuitive than men. This is because women are working with the female energy,the intuitive energy, but as men balance themselves and connect with theirfeminine they, too, have an equal potential for intuition. It is not the shapeof the body, it is the nature of the energy which decides how intuitive we are.This intuition speaks to us in a sort of “knowingness”. It shows itself when wesay: “I don’t know why I have to be in London tomorrow, but I just know I’ve gotto be there”. When you arrive in London purely on intuition, something happens,a “coincidence” which makes it clear why your intuition (your higher levels)guided you to bePicture #234 [images/img_0234.png]Picture #235 [images/img_0235.png]Figure 14: As our Eggshells crack and shatter, we open ourselves tomultidimensional wholeness205there. I lose count how many times this happens to me every week and to all thepeople I know. Once you open yourself to your higher potential and refuse to bea robot, the most amazing things start to happen to you because you are thenconnected to the energy stream of guidance from the levels of you that can makethose things happen. As long as we follow our intuition and don’t succumb to “Ohmy God”, we are always, and I mean always, in precisely the right place atprecisely the right time with precisely the right people. I just follow myintuition and everything happens as it’s meant to. You, everyone, can do thesame - and more. The future will not be chaos, it will be amazingly ordered, butin an unpredictable way. Life will cease to be an ordeal and start to become adaily adventure.There was one occasion when I was at home in England watching a video of a stageshow called Riverdance which was performing at the time in Dublin, Ireland. Myintuition, that knowiugness, was urging me to go and see it live. I checked myschedule of talks and workshops and it allowed me only one free day to see theshow. A friend in Dublin bought the tickets and I arrived in the theatre a fewminutes before the start to find my friend looking very bemused and worried. Shesaid she had overheard a security guard say that the “security seats” were inrow S, numbers 25, 26, 27, and 28. Now I knew why she was bemused because shekuew that I had row S, numbers 25 and 26. Security seats? For me? No-one knewthat I even had those seats, so why the “security”. Somewhat bemused myself bynow, I went to the seats with another friend and sat down. Although the rest ofthe theatre was packed and the show was about to begin, row S was virtuallyempty. What was going on? At this point, heads were turning to the back of thetheatre and I saw someone walk in surrounded by a ring of security “heavies”. Afew seconds later I looked down the row to see Jimmy Carter, the firstTrilateral Commission President of the United States, walking towards me withhis wife. They sat next to me in the other two “security” seats! I couldn’t stoplaughing. I had written about Jimmy Carter in The Robots ’ Rebellion in thecourse oF highlighting how US presidents are merely puppets of the Global Elite.At that time I had just finished ... and the truth shall set you free in whichMr Carter featured once again. And here I was sitting next to him and his wifein “security” seats, just days after my intuition had said: “Go and see the showin Dublin - now”. As a result of that event, I was to leam more about thebackground to the Elite pyramid of manipulation. Now, imagine this. You aresitting around a boardroomPicture #236 [images/img_0236.png]206table with your mobile phone and filofax. The question is asked: “Ladies andgentlemen, we have to arrange for this guy to sit next to Jimmy Carter and hiswife in special security seats in a Dublin Theatre and it has to be on oneparticular night. We don’t know when Carter will be in Dublin or even if he willever be there and there’s no reason why our man would qualify for security seatsanyway. Any suggestions on how we do this?” The room would be full of glazedfaces and drooping jaws. Where on Earth would you start? It would be virtuallyimpossible. But follow your intuition and it happens perfectly without anyhassle or preparation at all. If we rid ourselves of the conditioned self, theeggshell, and allow our higher levels to connect powerfully with us, the worldto come will be the least chaotic in the modem history of this planet. We willalways be in the right place, at the right time, with the right people, doingwhatever we need to do at that moment. It may not always be what we want to do,but it will always be what we need to do. You could be put on precisely theright spot at precisely the right time in the middle of South America without amap or a compass. I know. I’ve done it and anyone can do it.There are some people who I’m sure will say that this book is simplistic, but itisn’t. All I am exposing here are the mental and emotional barriers that keepour conscious level from enjoying a natural and powerful connection with itsmultidimensional, infinite self. Once that connection is made, you no longerneed guidance or advice from those in the dense physical world. You get all youneed from the higher dimensions of yourself - dimensions that operate wellbeyond the delusions of the physical. I hear some in the New Age say that youwill only find enlightenment if you do this or do that. I don’t accept this viewfor a second. We are all unique, thank goodness. What I need is not necessarilywhat you need. We are all on our own path and the only person who knows what isright for us is... us, the higher, guiding, levels of us. Access those, followthat intuitive guidance, and away you go. It’s simple. If they tell you it’scomplicated, they’ve missed the point - in my opinion anyway.We are in the process of withdrawing from the illusions of that light at thebottom of the bottle and we are turning our eyes to the real light at the top:the one that is leading us out of here and back to the paradise ofmultidimensional infinity. We are evacuating the Hassle-Free Zones of dogma andimposition as we realise they are not really hassle free at all. We just thinkthey are. Conforming through fear to this imposedPicture #237 [images/img_0237.png]207thought and behaviour has caused us enormous hassle within our hearts and ourpsyche as we suffer the emotional pain and mental despair triggered by the dailybattle to suppress who and what we really are. Leap over the wall and there youwill find a truly Hassle-Free Zone, that glorious, magical place where you runwith the flow of intuitive energy, free from the nagging and the fear of Oh MyGod. Who cares what people may think of you when you first make that transitionfrom robot to rebel? It doesn’t matter what they think of you. What matters iswhat you think of you. Are you going to let your life be ruled by the views ofthe sheep who merely absorb the programmed opinions of the other sheep andaccept them as their own? Or are you going to set yourself free and escape fromthe herd altogether? That is the choice which infinity is challenging you tomake. For me, the way to achieve this is staring us in the face:Let us respect our own right to be unique and to express that uniqueness; let usrespect the right of others to express their uniqueness, free from ridicule orcondemnation; and let us never seek to impose what we believe on anyone else.That simple philosophy will transform your life and life on this planet.It will bring an end to the mass schizophrenia that underpins the Hassle-FreeZones. If we respect our own right to be unique we cease to be a slave toimposed thought and behaviour. If we respect everyone’s right to that samefreedom, we cease to be the police force of the other slaves. With that, theherd and the manipulation of the herd is no more. It is time to remember who weare and where we come from. You are not your job and you are not your race. Youare not a road sweeper, an airline pilot or a “housewife”. You are Dot an Arabor a Gentile or a Jew. You are not English or German or Asian. You are not yourreligion or your political “ism”. You are not your gender or your sexualpreference. You are not even your thoughts. You are the silence between them,the silence from which your thoughts are created. You are a unique aspect ofevolving consciousness on the threshold of a dream, a dream you have worked toachieve for so long. Pack your bag, open your heart, and let’s get out of here.Come on gang. We’re going home.Picture #238 [images/img_0238.png]Picture #239 [images/img_0239.png]Picture #240 [images/img_0240.png]9Picture #241 [images/img_0241.png]Picture #242 [images/img_0242.png]Picture #243 [images/img_0243.png]210Other books, videos and cassettes by David IckeThe Truth Vibrations £5.99 $10.95 GatewayThe remarkable story of his spiritual awakening and the psychic communicationshe was given about events over the next ten years and beyond, many of which arealready proving to be accurate.Days of Decision £5.99 $ 10.95 Jon Carpenter PublishingA read-it-in-two-hours summary of the themes behindDavid Icke’s view of life and the present transfonnation of Planet Earth.Days of Decision: The Speech £6.95 $9.95 .
