Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation Oscar Wilde n 1990,1 consciously began an incredible journey of se lf-discovery. I had no idea where it would lead, but I was going anyway. I'd had enough. This 'world' had never made sense to me: the injustice, the stupidity, the way the system turns people into little more than machines working th rough a spin cycle of repeating experience and behaviour they hysteric ally call life'. We don't li ve life - life lives us. There are exceptions and many will be reading this book, but most people are told what to think, where to go, what to do and how to do it. Not so? Well, where do you get your 'information' that leads you to reach conclusions about yourself and the world? Who decides what time you get up every workday? Who decides where you go and what you do when you get there? Who decides how you do it? If you are like the overwhelming majority of people currently resident in this dreamworld, those decisions are not made by you at a ll; they are imposed by the 'system', the spider's web of control that dictates its will upon your 'life'. You get your 'information' from the main stream media that sells you the daily falsehoods on which you decide what to th ink and believe. You have to get up at a certain time because you have to report for work and you can't be late. You go where your bosses tell you to go and you do wh at they say. If you rebel you get fired and if you don't get paid you can't a fford a home or enough to eat. And it's not only you. What about yo ur family and others depend ent upon you? If you don't serve the system what are the consequences for them? To meet all these perceived needs and responsibilities, you have to spend every day keeping other people happy. In turn, the bosses are also slavis hly following the impositions of those who control them and they dare not step out of line either. Bosses have bosses, too. Take a farmer supplying food to a supermarket; he dictates to his farmworkers and if they don't do as he tells them they 're sacked. But he also has to do whatever the supermarket tells him or he loses the contract and ca n go out of busi ness. At the 1 I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2.

Round and round it goes, this circle of dependen cy and imposition of will. One man's slave is another man's mast er; one man's sheep is another man's shepherd. This is the way the world is purposely structured. The system wants everyone controlling ever yone else and this is done in a billion different ways. What we call 'free societies' are Gulags by any other name. Th e system doesn't serve us - we serve it. We are slaves who delude ourse lves that we are free because we don't want to face the reality of our plight. I was on an American radio show one night when a call er made a great point. He likened humanity to the husband who knows his wife is being unfaithful, but is desperately trying to persuade himself it's not true. When she comes home he confronts her about where sh e's been and who she's been with. The husband knows the truth, but he is desperately hoping that his wife's explanation sounds credible enough for him to go on kidding himself that everything is fine. He'd rather hear a good lie than accept an unpleasant truth. In th e same way, most people don't want to face the conspiracy and corruption of governments or ask why the countries go to war against defenceless civilians, in cluding their own. When governments deliver the lies and excuses for their grot esque actions most people are ready to accept them because they want to believe th e lies are true. The al ternative is to face the fact that the government is not a beni gn servant of the people - it's the other way round. It is to face the reality that the forces which control the United States are capable of orchestrating th e horrors of 9/11 and blaming someone else; and that they can brazenly attend f uneral services for the victim s while knowing they helped to kill them. How many people are strong enough to face that and what it means for their lives? This is one major reason why th e official lies prevail as accepted truth. The alternative is too unthinkable, too unbe arable, to contemplate; so most people don't. Pass me a bucket , heavy on the sand. The same is true of the collective denial we have about our li ves: 'I've got a big house and a big car; ain't life great?' Well, the house and the car may be great, but life? How many people are do ing what they really want to do? How many are truly happy, fulfilled and at peac e with themselves? Hardly any, in truth. Isn't that in itself a profound condemnation of the insanity we call 'life'? Most people do what they think they have to do and that mean s serving the system on the system's terms. Why do we confuse 'life' w ith the world as it is curr ently experienced? What has life got to do with blowing up children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children and calling it 'liberation'? Where is the life in getting up at the same time every morning to sit in the same jam, or queue for the same train, on the way to the same job that leaves you bored, frustrated and unfulfilled, before returning through the same jam, or same queue, to wa tch the same nightly TV that treats you like a moron? Where is the life in sending our children to schools and universities designed to spit them out as the programmed cogs of the next generation? But, again, we'd rather conv ince ourselves that we have a 'good job', 'good career', 'good life', and give our ch ildren a 'good education', than face the "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"No Snowtlake in an Avalanche Ever Felt Responsible 3 horror of horror s that life is actually shit. Or sh it compared with what it could be and we would like it to be. In deed, it's not 'life' at all. It is a veil of tears disguised with heavy mascara and massi ve dabs of self-delusion. We judge our 'happiness' by our state of unhappiness, and our achievements by the symbols and trinkets that the system ha s decreed are the essent ials of 'success'. On the day I was writing this I saw the results of a study about the mental and emotional health of teenag ers in Britain, although th e same will a pply across the industrialised, computerised, world an d beyond. The study: 'Time Trends in Adolescent Mental Health', published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, revealed that the number of 15-year-old s suffering from anxiety and depression had increased by 70 per cent in less th an 20 years. Hey, we are talking 15-year-olds! The study concluded that a key cause of this dramatic increase in teenage emotional trauma was the pressure to 'succeed'. It should have added, more accurately, to succeed on the system's terms. The st udy said the 'pressures of succeeding academically and the prospect of debt are contributing to widespread unhappiness'. In Britain, thanks to the Blair govern ment, students face a mountain of debt when they leave university be cause of the loans they have had to take out to pay for their education (or what passes for it). Debt means control by the system and that's the real reason for student lo ans. The study also pointed out the imbalance in time spent at school compared with leisure acti vities, something I ha ve been highlighting for years. They keep the kids at school fo r hours on end five da ys a week and when the prison door opens they send them off with home work! When do children and young people have time to do what they wa nt to do? Answer: in between th e deluge of academic bullshit designed to turn out the mind-fodder that keeps the system rolling on like some runaway snowball, gath ering more and more of our freedoms and uniqueness in its daily wake. Another study: The Growing Pains Surve y, reported by the UK Press Association in October 2004, confirmed these trends wi th three quarters of parents interviewed saying their children were under far more pressure than th ey had been at the same age. A similar percentage said that peer pressure and stresses at school (such as bullying and exams) had the greatest impact on their child's emotional health and well-being. And exams for what, pray? To re veal the extent to which the system controls their minds and perception. Acco rding to the survey, seven out of ten parents said the government should be in vesting more in the provision of mental health services for children and young people. Oh my God, get me out of here! Never mind 'treating' the problem, how about removing th e cause? How about changing the way your children feel by tel ling them to relax and have fun because education and passing the system's exams is a pile of crap? 'Edu cation' is there to program, indoctrinate and implant a collect ive belief in a rea lity that suits the power structure. It is about subordination, limitation, and the 'I can't', 'you can't', mentality because that's what the system wants everyone to express in their journey to the grave or the hot box. What we call Educa tion doesn't open minds, it screws down the lid. As Albert Ei nstein put it: 'The only th ing that interferes with my "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4- Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion learning is my education'. He also said that education is 'what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school'. Why does it make parents proud to see their children getting certificates of 'achievement' for telling the system what it demands to hear? I'm not saying people shouldn't pursue knowledge but, if we are talking freedom here, that has to be done on our terms, not the system's. It is al so sobering to note that politicians, government officials, journa lists, scientists, doctors, lawyers, judges, business leaders and others who administer or se rve the system, are invariably those who have been through the same university (indoctrination) mind-machine. Sadly, intelligence and passing exams are so often be lieved to be the same thing. I was in a disco one night where the dance floor was empty beca use the DJ was playing music the people didn't want to hear . This ego from hell refused to change it a nd I asked if that was very intelligent in the circ umstances. He was outraged at such a suggestion. He had proof that he was intell igent - he had a degree!. Hilarious. Basic intelligence is to see that people aren't dancing because the music is shite and to change it for something they like; a degree is to tell the system what it has told you to tell it. What is intelligent about that? Most people kid themselves that they are free by never testing the theory for real. They are like flies caught in a web and so long as th ey don't try to move they can convince themselves that they could if they wanted to. It's just that they don't want to right now, you see (Figure l ) . I f they tried they would ha ve to face the fact that their arse is superglued to someone el se's control system with dinner about to be served - them. They keep doing what the government dictator ships tell them to do, without question or challenge, and perpet uate the illusion that they have free choice by never making one. 'Having my wings stuck to this web suits me fine because I am choosing not to fly.' I have met so many people over the years who thought they were free until they did something that wa s outside the 'norm'. A big reality check followed because, to quote th at great American comedian, Bill Hicks: 'You are free to do as we te ll you'. As the Orwellian global state emerges rapidly from the shadows, this self -deception about a 'free worl d' is becoming far more difficult to sustain. But instead of starin g their plight in the face, most just try harder to look the other way. Most peopl e are quick to complain about what is happening in their lives and the wider worl d, yet they are cast in stone when it comes to doing anything about it. Far better, it seems, to avoid your own responsibility by blaming some one else. The world is like it is because we have allowed the few to make it that way and just pointin g the finger at those few is not enough. We are all involved in this. Voltaire capt ured this theme brilliantly when he said: 'No snowflake in an aval anche ever felt responsible'. From the time I was seven or eight this 'world' seemed crazy to me and when I began to see what lay behind the illusion we call 'reality', I was an open door. There was no need to push; I was already swin ging. There had to be a reason why the world was so ludicrous and why so few appeared able to see it or, at least, admit it to themselves. My incredible experiences since 1990 have shown me th at there is indeed a reason, a met hod in the madness.

I explain how my journey be gan in Tales from the Ti me Loop but, in summary, I was told through a psychic that I would be given the 'spiritual riches' to, in effect, lift the veil of illusion that held humanity in servitude. Knowledge would be put into my mind and at other times I would be led to knowledge, the psychic told me. 'One man cannot change the world, but one man can commun icate the message that will change the world' , she said. Many other psyc hics repeated the same themes. There were secrets to be revealed - enormous secrets - and I would be led to this knowledge and comm unicate it on a global sc ale. One said: 'Arduous seeking is not necessary. The path is alre ady mapped out. You onl y have to follow the clues'. It sounded fantastic at the time , but how true it proved to be. From that point on, my life became an explosion of synchronicity and 'coincidence'.

The plan is for a world government dictatorship that includes a second tier of superstates like the European Union. What we now call 'countries' would be merely administrative subsidiaries controlled by the world government, central bank and army. This structure would allow a few to impose their will on the global population right order to most swiftly assimilate. I have been guided along a path that began with an understanding of th e manipulation in this 'world ', the reality we think is 'physical', and then took me into other r ealms that interpenetra te this one - what scientists call parallel universes. In the first two chapters I am going to summarise this information before moving to the next amazing stage in the unfolding revelation of who we are, where we are, and what we are doing here. Through the 1990s, thanks to unseen guidance and synchronised 'coincidence', I began to understand and communicate the 'f ive-sense' level of a global conspiracy for human control orchestrated throug h a network of secret societies and interbreeding families known as the Illuminati. These ar e the families that control governments, the banking system, tr ansnational corporations, oil and pharmaceutical cartels, world media, intelligence agenci es, police forces and even what is taught in the schools and univers ities. All these aspects of society, and so many more, are ultimately controlled by the same Illu minati families pursuing the same agenda of glob al tyranny. Their aim is a centralised fascist state headed by a world government, central bank, curre ncy, and army that will enslave a microchipped population connected to, and controlled by, a global computer network (Figure 2). People la ughed when I first suggested that this was the plan, but only the uninformed and concrete-minded are smirking now. The Orwellian 'Big Brother' nightmare unfurls by the day, especially since 9/11. This is not surprising when you realise that those attacks were engineered by the sa me force that now uses them as an excu se to impose its fascist agenda to 'save us' from terrorism (see 6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"h Sawllake in an Avalanche Ever Felt Responsible 7 Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster). We can clearly see the rapidly advancing centralisation of power and ownership in all areas of our lives and it has become known as globalisation. This is not just about big, greedy corporations, as so many of the 'Left' would have us believe. The major corporations are not the end, but a means to the e nd. They are part of a coordinated and long-planned agenda fo r global control which ta rgets every expression of human existence. In politics we have supers tates like the European Union, and its emerging mirrors: the African Union, Asia Pacifi c Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the planned 'Free Trade' Area of the Americas (FTAA). These are structured to align with a basic fact of life for would-be dictatorships - the mo re you centralise decision-making the more power the few have over the ma ny. Diversity is the worst nightmare of the dictator because he can't control all the points of decision-making. Uniformity and centralisation are essential to Fascism or Communism or whatever name you give to your dictat orship of choice. Thus, we see the centralisation of everything introduced with an ever-gathering pace. The world government is de signed to be the capstone on this pyramid of political tyranny and th e world army's role is to im pose its decisions on countries that want to govern themselves. It is for this reason that national armies are more and more subordinate to, and merely a part of, grouping s like NATO and the United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is an ex ample of what I call the 'Totalitarian Tiptoe' in which you go step by step to a long-decided goal instead of making colossal changes all at once. If the steps are t oo big many people would see what was going on and that's not the idea. Our ignorance is their bliss. In Europe, the EEC, or Common Market 'free trade' ar ea, became the centra lised fascist state known as the European Union thanks to the drip, drip, drip of change imposed through the Totalitarian Tiptoe, and the same is happening elsewhere. The Illuminati manipulate their placemen and women into the key positions in politics, and most of the rest who make up the political numbers are ignorant fodder. Intelligence never was an essential attribute of a politician and often it is a bad career move. Tim Collins, a Conserva tive Member of Parliament in the UK, was sent details by a constituent about flaws in the official story of the 'plane' that was supposed to have hit the Penta gon on 9/11. Mr Collins was offered the chance to see a DVD presentation detailing th is evidence, but he refused to even look at it. His 'executive assistant' wrote that Mr Collins '... does not believe in conspiracy theories, and regards it as particularly reprehensible that the creators of the DVD to which you refer should be seeking to play games with such a terrible tragedy'. This was without even bothering to see it, and the fact that people like Tim Collins become politicians might also be considered a terrible tragedy for those they are supposed to represent. When you have Members of Parliament or Congress with this mentality - and Collins is a norm, not a rarity - manipulating the political system is child's play. Politics always reminds me of Albert Einstein's adage that you can't solve problems with the same level of intelligence that created them. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Figure 3: The Russian doll dict atorship. Global society is structured as pyramids within bigger pyramids with one encompassing them all. At the top are the Illuminati families manipulating their agenda for global control through apparently unconnected organisations and institutions. 'Free societies' are a myth because the Hidden Hand is imposing its agenda behind this veil of deceit The control of banking and business is already in a few ha nds and the trend continues. The European currency - the euro - is part of the Illuminati agenda to replace all currencies with a single worl d currency controlled by the planned World Central Bank. As Mayer Amsc hel Rothschild, f ounder of the (Illuminati) banking dynasty, is reported to have said: 'Give me control of a nation's currency and I care not who makes the laws'. Take that a st age further and you have the plan for a world dictatorship in which they control the world currency a nd make the laws. The Illuminati families use their secret so ciety network and inte rlocking, proxy, gofer directors to control all the major banks and transnational corporations. There may appear to be different na mes on the major boards of directors, but they are answerable to the masters who put them there and dictate the policy they pursue. As detailed in my other books , the world is controlled on the five-sense level by a structure of pyramids within pyramids, like Russian dolls, one inside the other. At the top of these pyramids, especially the biggest one that enco mpasses all the rest, are the Illuminati families (Figure 3). Fr om there they manipul ate and impose their agenda for centralisation of global power right across society. Those involved with pressure groups, which challe nge the system on many and various issues, need to understand that they are all dealing with the same Illuminati families at the top of the pyramid. Through their transnational corporations , the Illuminati control, among much else, the world's oil, gas, electricity and water supplies, drug production and 'medicine', and food produc tion and distribution.

It is there for all to see on British banknotes charging interest on it. Wh at we call money is only de bt being pass ed around as cheques, wire transfers, credit and even 'cas h'. What we call cash is not money; it is debt. Money is created by issuing credit - a debt - and no matter what form this credit may subsequently take (cash, cheques, whatever) it is always recycling debt. The word credit is Latin for 'he trusts' or 'he believes', and that's exactly what 'money' really is: a belief that it is real. It is not. Even the debt bit is an illusion because how can you be in de bt if nothing has been give n to you in th e first place? When a bank makes a 'loan' it is loan ing nothing. They simp ly type into your account the figure they have agreed to 'l oan' you against your house, business or land. They don't create money, they create debt by tappi ng the keys of a computer program and from that moment you have to pay them back the non-existent 'money' they have 'loaned' you, plus inte rest! If you don't do that they can take your property - for loaning you nothing. Governments bo rrow 'money' in the same way and taxpayers become re sponsible for 'paying back' the banks the non-existent money that has been 'borrowed' on thei r behalf by governments controlled by the same forces that own the banks. If you wr ote this as fiction they would say it was too far-fetched to be credible, but this is the reality of the banking fraud. British banknotes 'promise to pay the bearer on de mand the sum of whatever the note is said to be worth (Figure 4) . How can this be? If I owe you ten pound s and I give you ten pounds I have gi ven you what I owe, right? Yes, if the ten pound note is money as we understand it to be. But it's not. It is nothing more than an IOU, a promise to pay - a debt. When you lend me ten pounds you lend me a debt and when I give you back the ten pounds I give you b ack the debt. How can we pay money to anyone when there isn't any? My wife, Pam, had a letter from the pol ice in Hampshire, England, claiming she had been caught on a speed camera doing six miles an hour ov er the limit on an empty road at midnigh t. They wanted £60 for this crime against humanity. I wrote to a guy at Hampshire Police , a debt collector for the government who went by the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is illusion title of 'Manager, Central Ticket Office'. I asked him how the 'money' could be paid when there was no money. Wa sn't it illegal to pay a debt with a debt and how, therefore, was it possible to pay them without committing fra ud? He refused to answer the question no matter how many times I asked him because he had no answer. The police document ev en suggested that the 'mon ey' be paid by credit card! I also asked the Chief Constable of Hampshire and the 'Justices' Chief Executive' how it was possible to pay when there was no money, only debt. They also gave me the silent treatment because they have nowhere to go except ignore the question. Yet billi ons go hungry, lose their homes, live in poverty and even die through lack of money when it is only il lusory figures on computer screens. A Rothschild family communique to associ ates in New York in 1863 summed up the situation perfectly: The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its favours, that there will be no opposition from that class; while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantages ... will bear its bur den without complaint, and perhaps without suspecting that the system is in imical to their best interests.' The whole banking system is based on a fraud of stunnin g proportions to control and suppress the people. There is nothi ng wrong with having a unit of exchange and calling it money. That is not my point. It is that once you have private banks owned by the same people creating the ex change out of nothi ng, and charging interest to do so, you have all you need fo r global tyranny. This is what we have and it has been installed because the same families that control the banks also control the politicians that pass the banki ng laws. Staggering as it may be to anyone new to this, banks are allowe d to lend ten times what they have on deposit. It is called fractional re serve lending. Every tim e you put a pound or dollar into a bank you are giving it the right to lend ten pounds or dollars it does not have. Many people think that banks are lending depos itors' money when they are actually lending fresh air, figures on a screen. Wh en you follow 'money' from bank to bank in cheques and transfers etc., you find th ey are creating more and more 'money' from your original deposit or loan because each time this is spent and ends up in a different bank, more credit is loaned agains t it. The amount of interest that banks accrue through this fraud is astonishi ng. The manipulation of the money/banking system is one of the most effective means of dictatorship by the Illuminati families and an example of the depth to which we are scammed. People work in jobs they hate to 'pay the mortgage'. But what is this mortgage? It is a debt paid by th e bank to you in exch ange for you paying th em back an even bigger debt. But you can't - in law - pay a debt with a debt! And they say I'm mad! See my other books for the detailed and extraordinary background to the global banking fraud. This Illumina ti network of interconnec ting banks and companies is using its influence (control) in government to destro y smaller non-Illuminati businesses and make everyone depend ent on the elite families to survive. Why is it "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"k tatwflake in an Avalanche Ever Felt Responsible 11 that governments continually pa ss laws that make life easi er and more profitable for big corporations, but more di fficult and costly for sma ll businesses? Here you have the answer and it is a simple equation: dependency = control; diversity = freedom. In the media, the power over what we s ee and hear is now in ridiculously few hands. There may appear to be ever-incr easing media 'divers ity' with more and more television channels, but the number of those who contro l them and their output continues to contract. When I beca me a television reporter/presenter in the 1970s it was unthinkable that the regional Independent Television (ITV) stations around the United Kingdom would not be ow ned independently of each other. This was thought essential for the free flow of unbiased informat ion. But today one company, Carlton-Granada, controls the whole of ITV throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 'I ndependent' radio is going the same way rapidly. Even that is not the end beca use the Illuminati ag enda demands total control, and all over the world the regulat ion of media ownershi p is being reduced or binned. The British government under Illuminati puppet, Tony Blai r, has done this to an outrageous extent and seeks to allow more foreign ownership of the media so that global corporations like Disney, and others, can move in. The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), headed by Colin Powell's son, Michael, is continually pressing for limi ts on ownership to be relaxe d still further. This is allowing a few Illuminati co rporations to own enormous swathes of the national and global media and destroy wh at is left of diversity of output and vi ew. The idea is to control informat ion to such an extent that peopl e will only see and hear what suits the Illuminati dictatorsh ip. This is exactly what Ge orge Orwell envisioned in his book, 1984. A media group called Clear Cha nnel, which has close connections to the Bush family, is one example. It ha s purchased a vast number of US radio stations and dictates the 'new s' output. In Detroit alone it owns seven of the city's most popular stations. Befo re and during the 2003 invasion of Ira q, Clear Channel was funding rallies aimed at gathering support for the war while suppressing alternative views on its airwaves. Major corporations like General Electric co ntrol the US televisi on networks from which most Americans get their 'news'. Ge neral Electric owns the NBC network, CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, Mun2TV, Sci-Fi channel, Trio, WNBC - New York, KNBC Los Angeles, WMAQ Chicago, WCAU Phila delphia, KNTV San Jose/San Francisco, KXAS - Dallas/Fort Worth, WRC Washingt on, WTVJ Miami, KNSD San Diego, WVIT Hartford, WNCN Raleigh, WCMH Columbus, WVTM Birmingham, WJAR Providence, KVEA/KWHY Los Angeles, WNJU New York, WSCV Miami, KTMD Houston, WSNS Chicago, KXTX Dallas/Fo rt Worth, KVDA San Antonio, KSTS San Jose/San Francisco, KDRX Phoenix, KNSO Fresno, KMAS Denver, WNEU Boston/Merrimack, KHRR Tucs on and WKAQ Puerto Rico. 1 They also own Universal Studios, NBC Universal Televisi on Studio and NBC Universal Television Distribution. Imagine the power that gives them to implant a false reality. Media tycoons like Rupert Murdoch head companies that control streams of television and radio stations and newspape rs worldwide, togeth er with the movie"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion studio Twentieth Century Fox, book publishers like Harp er Collins, and the Delphi Internet system. One Murdoch 'asset', Fox News, or Fix News to be more accurate, is the most biased television propaganda channel I have yet seen. Through conglomerates like General Electric, Murdoch's News Corporation, Disney and AOL-Time Warner, the Illuminati also co ntrol Hollywood and the music industry. You may see 'different' music labels and movie studios, but e ssentially the same force dominates th em and decides what will and w on't be seen and heard. You will appreciate when we get to the focus of this book just how vital this media domination is to the Illuminati agenda. It goes much further and far deeper than just telling lies and hiding truths about wo rld events. Without this imposition of what people largely see and hear the rest of the control structure would collapse. Two small examples of media manipulation and false reporting reveal the bigger story. A former BBC journalist told me how she was asked to take a camera into the streets and record what people thought ab out the Queen Mother when she died in 2002 at the age of 101. The repo rter found that '99 per cent ' of those she interviewed said they didn't like the Queen Mother and didn't care that she had died. As a journalist of integrity, she reported the truth of what had happened, but found herself severely reprimanded by her bosse s. The official BBC line was that the 'Queen Mum' (a really nasty piece of wo rk) was loved and admi red by the nation. The journalist asked her sycophant 'superior s' if they were saying she should have lied. 'In the circumstances you should have bent the truth', they said. She was horrified and resigned. Sadly, there are fe w like her and the truth is not only bent every day, it is massacred. While I was writing this book, I had my la test experience (one of many hundreds) that highlighted the media's extraordinary inabi lity to report the facts - and the public's naive belief in what they read and hear. I was approached by a television programme called Celebrity Big Brother, in which 'well-known' people live in a 'house' for up to two weeks while being f ilmed 24 hours a day. The viewers vote to eject the 'celebrities' until th ere is one left - the 'winner' . I met with representatives of the programme to see if, appalling as th e 'show' was, it might be an opportunity to get across information that the public wouldn't normally he ar. I quickly decided that it wasn't, and I neve r heard any further from them , nor them from me. But in the two months and more that followed, ne wspapers began to re port that I was going to be on the programme. Ri ght up to the day this was being repeated and one paper even sent a reporter to kn ock on my brother's door looking for quot es about my appearance. A Sunday paper said that I ha d been replaced at the last minute by someone else when I had never been schedu led to appear. In the ten weeks that the stories were running not once did any of these papers ev er ask ... me! Yet, nonsense as the reports were, the public believed them . I was constantly st opped in the street to be asked about my appearance on the s how and most people be lieved that it must be happening because they had read it in a newspaper. Radio programmes repeated the story and it became th e accepted truth ev en though it was 100 per cent wrong. What I have just described is how, minute by minute, people are sold a false reality by the media. The Big Brother expe rience, and the Queen mother story, may"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"13 be minor examples, but the same principles apply to the reporting of wars, politics, busi ness, finance, science and all the rest - as detailed in my other books like Tales from the Time Loop. People are constantly misled by a combination of incompetence, ignorance and calcula ted deceit. It may not matter if people wrongly believe that I am going to appear on some trash television show; but it does when they accept the offi cial story of 9/11 and the manufactured 'war on terror'. Then there are the microchips and surveillance came ras. You would need an honours degree in self- delusion not to see the monumental expansion of surveillance technology everywhere you go. This has been justified in response to terrorist outrages orchestrated by the very forces behind the introduction of the microchips and surveillance! This is the technique I have dubbed Problem- Reaction-Solution in which you secretly create a problem (like 9/11), tell the people a false story about the perpetrators and reasons behind it and, when the people say 'something must be done', you offer the solution to the problem you have created (Figure 5). As we ha ve seen since 9/11, these 'solutions' advance the Orwellian agenda. The technique is to put the people in fear so they will look to their leaders to protect them with new laws that suit the plan for human enslavem ent. Dr William Sargan t, a psychiatrist with the Illumina ti Tavistock Ins titute in Britain, wrote in his 1957 book, Battle for the Mind: 'Various types of belief can be implanted in people after brain function has been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear, anger or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbanc es the most common one is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility. Its various group manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of ' herd instinct', and appear most spectacularly"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Bse is Illusion in wartime, during severe epidemics, and all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety and so individual and mass suggestibility. '... We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collective psyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authoritie s to \"protect people\" from that fear.' Levels of surveillance have soared to 'protect' (con trol) the people since the attacks of 9/11. When you walk through towns or ci ties you are watched by one camera after another. Go into a store and it is invariably the same, as it is with airports, train statio ns and even, as I experienced r ecently, in some taxicabs. Sitting in that cab, with a camera recording my every move, wa s such a symbol of where we are, never mind where we are going. If you have a mobile phone you can be tracked to within a few feet and microchi ps in cars can do the same. Your credit card records your every purchase and ev erywhere you go to use it; and the interconnecting databases mean that an y government agenc y, and many others outside of government, can tell you your life story in intimate detail. We now have iris-recogn ition cameras being introd uced, voice-recognition technology and, oh yes, the microchipped human. How they la ughed when I first began to say that this is where we were heading, a system in which every child is chipped within moments of birth. 'You're a nutter', I was told. Do I still hear the sound of laughter? I think not, becaus e human microchipping is well under way. They have used the Totalitarian Tiptoe to make people familiar with chipping. They started with domestic and farm animals, went on to clothing and other products, and finally came the main ta rget - us. As always, they emphasise all the alleged benefits of being microchipp ed cattle while ignoring the true agenda. They say you would be able to track your child, have your medical re cords available if you are hit by a truck, and get rid of those awful cr edit cards. 'See ho w much we care?' Everything could be put on the chip under your skin and you c ould even fast-track through an airport or pay for your grocer ies without ever having to reach for your pocket. Now doesn't that ju stify being a tagged animal ? You know it makes sense. A United Press Internationa l (UPI) report I read in April 2004 said the US Department of Health and Human Services had announced a trial to 'more closely monitor and assist the natio n's homeless population'. Note the Orwellian use of the word 'assist' when they really mean contro l. Under the pilot pr ogramme, the report said that homeless people in participatin g cities would be impl anted with mandatory Radio Frequency Identificati on (RFID) chips so that so cial workers and the police could track their movements in real-time. 'Supporters of subdermal RFID tracking say the technology will discourage im planted homeless me n and women from committing crimes, while ma king it easier for governm ent workers to provide social services such as delivering food a nd medicine', the report concluded. When these people say they are launching 'trials', this is forked-tongue speak for: 'We are getting our foot in the door by targeting peopl e that most of the public don't give a shit about, and when chippi ng is an established meth od of identification we are coming for the rest of you'. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"15 One of the main companies behind all this is Applied Digital Solutions in Florida who produce the rice-sized 'VeriChip' (Figures 6 and 7 overleaf). I have seen media reports claiming that the idea of embedd ing chips in the human body remained 'largely theoretical' until 9/11 when a technology executive at Applied Digital Solutions saw firefighters writing their badge numbers on their arms as identification in case they were disfigured or trapped. This led to the idea of chipping people, it was claimed. What utter trash. I highlighted this company before the atta cks in a book called Children of the Matrix and its launch of a chip called Digital Angel. Dr Peter Zhou, the chief scientist behind the technology, said before 9/11: 'Digital Angel will be a connection from yourself to the electronic world. It will be your guardian, protector. It will brin g good things for you. We w ill be a hybrid of electronic intelligence and our own soul.' Electronic intelligence and our own brain and central nervous system more like. The idea of microchipped people was not well received by those concerned about privacy and civil liberties, and promotion of the chip was cooled for a time. But after 9/11, Applied Digital So lutions took the opportunity to strike with a sales pitch of Human Chip = Human Security. It now claims to have chipped thousands of people, but the aim is fo r everybody to be tagged. One of VeriChip's early clients included Mexico's attorney general to 'p rotect him from kidnap'; and a company called Solusat, the Mexican distributor of Ve riChip, has launched a 'service' to chip children as an 'anti-kidnapping device'. It doesn't mention that these 'VeriKids', as it calls them, are kidnapped electronically the moment the chip goes in. Applied Digital Solutions is planning to introduce the 'VeriKid' scheme in other countries, including the United States. ORBCOMM, a global satellite telecomm unications company, announced on its website in late 2004 that agreement had been reached with the VeriChip Corporation, a subsidiary of Applied Digital, to provid e 'satellite and tele communication services for applications to be deve loped for use with the worl d's first implantable radio frequency identification (RFID) microchi p ...'. Jerry Eisenberg, CEO of ORBCOMM, said the relationship with VeriChip provided yet anothe r new and important industry that will use their sa tellite system and its ground infr astructure network to transmit messages globally. Yes, to cont rol the people. If you have read my book, And The Truth Shall Set You Free, you will kn ow that all this wa s predicted a long time ago. I wrote in "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 1994 that the human microchip would be sold to the people as a means of protecting children, having medical records available for doctors, and as a more convenient and thief-proof way of replacing the credit card. Applied Digital Solutions is already using all three ruses in its marketing statements. In October 2004, the Illuminati-controlled Food and Drug Administration gave permission for the company to market the VeriChip (a decision never in doubt) and the US Department of Health and Human Services announced $139 million in grants to advance 'President Bush's' plan for electronic health records (microchipped people) within a decade. The people work to pay the taxes and the taxes are used to further imprison the people. I have even seen an article about a Barcelona nightclub offering people a faster entrance if they would agree to be chipped. Apparently, Tuesday night is now 'implant night' when guests can be ch ipped between drinki ng and dancing. How many chipping schemes are being introduc ed that never ma ke the newswires? We will see the chip being used and promoted ever mo re widely in countless ways because the Illuminati gl obal state demands it for th e ultimate control of the people. The British government, for exam ple, has announced plans to introduce compulsory ID cards, but this is only a st epping stone, a Tota litarian Tiptoe, to microchipping the population. The same is happening in the Un ited States. A CIA scientist told me in 1997 that the chip is far more than a mean s of electron ic tagging. The messages going from the chip to th e computer are one thing, but more important are the messages going the other way. He said they could communicate with the embedded chips, either isolating an individual or doing it en masse, and send frequencies that could cause seve re pain or illness, manipulate people "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"k SMWIIake in an Avalanche Ever Felt Responsible 17 mentally and emotionally, an d even kill. The chip coul d make people docile or aggressive, sexually high or suppressed, and affect thei r thought processes so they couldn't think straight or were influenced in their act ions by what the chip was receiving. This is the real story behind the microchipping of humans. The aim of the system is to keep us in survival mode, always looking to tomorrow instead of living in the moment. As John Le nnon wrote: 'Life is what Happens to you while you're busy making other plans'. If our heads are down and we are focused on surv ival or seeking 'su ccess' we won't look up and see the game that enslaves us. A document that came to light in 1986 brilliantly described the techniques at work in what we call 'socie ty'. It was called Silent Weapons for a Quiet War, and another vers ion is reported to have been in the hands of US Naval Intelligence in 1969. The one I have was apparent ly found inside an IBM photocopier bought at a second-hand sale in America. This lengthy and detailed document outlines a policy that has been im plemented since at le ast the 1950s. It says the 'quiet war was ... declared by the international elite at a meeting held in 1954'. A significant Illuminati organisation called the Bild erberg Group first met in 1954 (see And The Truth Shall Se t You Free) and this consists of the elite in global politics, banking, business, military, intelligence agencies, and so on. The background, however, is less important than the content because it encapsulates the quiet war on the human psyche: Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant of basic systems principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganised, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand. This is achieved by: 1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality programme of public education in mathem atics, system design and economics, and discouraging technical creativity. 2. engaging their emotions, increasing thei r self indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities by: a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by the way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the TV and the newspapers. b) giving them what they desire - in excess - 'junk food for thought' - and depriving them of what they really need. c) rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities. These preclude their interest in, and discovery of, the silent weapons of social automation technology. The general rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion In summary: Media: Keep the adult public attention divert ed away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance. Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of re al mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history. Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.' The document says of the 'quiet war': It shoots situations, instead of bullets; pr opelled by data processing, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious noises, causes no obvious physical injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable 'noise', causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehend the weapon, and therefore cannot believe they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefor e, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with ot hers to defend themselves against it. When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. Recognise that society? Of course, we live in it. The scale of the deceit is extraordinary - even down to your name . Have you noticed that when you receive correspondence relating to government, la w and anything to do with finance, including taxation, your name is always spelt out in all upper case, as in DAVID ICKE? This is because your upper case name is not you. It is a corporation/trust set up by the government through the treasury depa rtment at your birth. Every time a child is born a corporation/trust is created using his or her name in all upper case. They do this because governments are corporations and they operate under commercial law, the law of contracts. Th e laws passed by g overnments only apply to corporations and not to living, breathing, flesh a nd blood sovereign-free men and "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"k SMwilake in an Avalanche Ever Felt Responsible 19 women spelt in upper-lower or all lower case, as with David Icke, or david icke. The living, breathing sovereign man and wo man is subject to common law, not the commercial law introduced by governments through legislation. Using commercial law makes it much easier to install an 'elected' dictatorship because, unlike common law, you are not subject to precedents built up over centuries. You simply have to get a majority to vote for a bill in Parliament or Congress, or have the US President sign a document, an d the law is imposed. What you also have to do - clearly not diffic ult - is to keep from the people the knowledge that their name in upper case is not them. Th ey will then pay you taxes and be subject to your jurisdiction and control in all areas of their lives by unknowingly standing surety for the corpora tion - 'DAVID ICKE' - that they don't even know exists. In the Unit ed States you may notice th at the national flag always has a gold fringe wh en displayed in a court or federa l building and you see this also on the uniforms of US troops . This is because under the International Law of the Flags a gold fringe indica tes the jurisdiction of comm ercial law, also known as British Maritime Law and, in the U.S., the Uniform Co mmercial Code or UCC. Americans think that their go vernment and legal system is pegged in some way to the Constitution, but it is not. The United States, like Britain and else where, is ruled by commercial law to overcome the checks and balances of common law. It's another monumental fraud. When Pam received the speeding ticket from Hampshire Police, her name was spelt in the letter in all upper case. They could not have done it any other way or their traffic law would not apply because it is a commercial law applicable only to a corporation. I wrote to the police to point out that they had sent their threat of prosecution to a corporation and not to the lower-case living, breathing sovereign woman of the same name. I asked how a corporation could drive a car and challenged them to prove their juri sdiction over a live woman under their commercial law. All they would say is th at the law was passed by the government and there was nothin g more to discuss. The chief debt collector in the speed ca mera department said they spelt the names in all upper case for the benefit of clarity. Or, to be more accurate, he said that this is what he ha d been taught was the reason. We are back to the compartmentalised pyramids again. The fodder employed to enforce the system must also be ignorant of wh at they are really involved with and they are given a false explanation for why things are done as they are. At least this guy said he had been taught; everyone else in the system I have asked about the use of upper case names had never even thought about it before . I have spoken with clerks of court, lawyers and financial people, and they said they had no idea why they always had to use names in all upper case . 'Maybe it's just the way the system is set up', said one clerk of the court. Yes it is, but this has nothing to do with 'clarity'. It is because commercial law only applies to corporat ions and so they must use upper case names because governments are corporations. I wrote to the Hampshire police guy to say that if clarity was the only reason fo r the upper case name would he please resend their threat of prosecution with Pa m's name in lower cas e. After all, there "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion would be no problem with clarity because we all knew who we were. He refused. Of course he did. The system wouldn't let hi m and even if he had tried to type in a lower case name, the police computer system would have defaulted to upper case. Such is the scale of the fraud that people are being prosecuted by laws that don't apply to them and fined 'money' that doesn't exist. Amazing, but true. The detail and sources for what I have outline d, and so much more, can be found in my other books, like And The Truth Shall Set You Free, The Biggest Secret and Tales from the Time Loop. But just look around and you can clearly see what is happening once you know the agenda and the techniques used to achieve it; the world becomes an open book when you understan d the game. So much of the global dictatorship is in place alre ady. The Illuminati families control the money (debt) in your pocket or bank; they control the co mpanies that provide most of the food, drink and power supplies, including the fuel in your car; they control the drugs you take and doctors you see; and they dictate what is taught in the schools, colleges and universities. They also control what mainstream 's cience' researches through their choices of funding, an d they control the governme nts that pass laws which suit their agenda and undermine or dest roy their opposition. They are a few years from completion with 2012 apparently a target period for them, it would seem. Once they have the global government structure, and especially the mass microchipping of the people, th eir fascist dictatorship will be revealed on a scale of horror and sickness that few could currently imagine. But this doesn't have to be. Our destiny is in our own hands if only we will grasp it. The secret agenda explains the endless co ntractions in our so cieties. People ask why things are done a certain way when there are obviously better options, but they don't realise that the po wer structure is not there to make things better or more effective for the population; it has been cr eated to serve the Illuminati agenda for human enslavement. So, as writ er Michael Ellner has said: 'Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy informatio n and religions destroy spirituality.' Why? Because they're meant to.

From the latter years of the 1990s, th e synchronicity of my life was leading me into areas of knowledge an d awareness beyond the five senses. Understanding the nature of these other dimensions or r ealities was fundamental to identifying the force that was behi nd the Illuminati. Everything in what we call Creation is energy resonating at different frequencies. The slower it vibrates the denser it appears to be (like a wall); the faster it vibrates the less and less dense and 'solid' it appear s until the energy is vibrating so quickly that it leaves the frequency range percei vable by the five senses. What we call matter is energy resonating to a slow vibr ation. Albert Einstein 's famous equation E=mc 2 , written in 1905, says that mass/matter is a very concentrated form of energy, and concentrated is certainly the word. If you converted a ll the energy in one kilogram of sugar or wate r it would power a car non-s top for around 100,000 years. Other dimensions of reality, which some call the 'spirit world', are simply realms vibrating too fast for us to see. It is easier now to talk of multiple realities because many scientists have begun to catch up with the mystics, psychics and ot hers who have been saying all along that this 'physical' world is onl y one reality within an Infi nite Consciou sness. These scientists would say ot her realities are parall el universes and part of a single unified energy field. Quantum physics, which explores r eality beyond the 'physical' world of the atom, is saying basical ly the same as the mystics, and people like me, who talk of different dimensions and frequenc ies of existence inte rpenetrating our own. Spirituality and true science - in its open-minded, open-hearted form - are essentially at one. It is mainstream scie nce and mainstream religion that has caused the apparent rift because they are slaves to arrogance, ignoranc e and dogma. One is not science and the other is not spiritual. They are two polarities of the same falsehood. The open-minded quantum physicist would ha ve no problem with most of what I am going to say in this book, while the cap- touching, protecting-my- funding, mainstream 'scientis t' would roll his eyes in bewilderment. Such is the 21 A"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion chasm of view that exists in the so-cal led scientific community. But it is the mainstream 'safe' version of scientific 'fact' that has dominated the academic text books and university lecture-theatres becau se that suits the agenda for human control. The power structure wants us to believe that we are merely bodies being shuffled from a cradle to a grave and what happens on the conveyor belt in between is called 'life'. In mainstream so ciety we are given the choice of believing that at the end of this life we either ceas e to exist, or we become subject to some dictatorial God who loves us so much he is quite prepared to send us into the fires of hell if we don't bow the head and bend the knee. I rejected both choices from an early age. They seemed equa lly ridiculous to me and it was only after my journey consciously began after 1990 that I found an swers that made sens e. I realised - or remembered, more like - that what we call Creation is made up of infinite frequencies and dimensions all sharing the same spa ce. They are like the radio and television stations broadcasting to wh ere you are now. They are 'a round' you and inside your body, but they are not consciously interferi ng with you or each other because they are on different frequencies. Only when the frequencies are very close on the dial do we have interfer ence. If you tune to Radio A that is what you will hear. You don't hear the others because you are not tuned to th eir frequencies, but they still exist and other people will be listening to them . When you move your dial from Radio A to Radio B, you are now hearing Radio B, of course, but Radio A doesn't disappear when you move the dial. It goes on broadcasting - existing - it's just that you can't hear it any more. These simple principles describe the na ture of existence in our reality and other conn ected dimensions. These different 'worlds' can share the same space because they are resonati ng at different frequencies. When our consciou sness enters a 'physical' body so me time after conception, it becomes locked in, tuned in, to this frequency range; so when babies are born they see this 'world' and not another one. It is also quite possible to be tuned to one primary reality but sti ll be aware of others , through what we call the sixth sense of 'psychic' sight, intu ition or hearing. Psychics tune their consciousness to other frequencies and access a channel for inform ation to be communicated. Some of this can be fantastically adva nced, some utter nonsense. It depends on the communicator and the quality of the 'channel' or psyc hic. There are countless stories of babies clearly seeing things that others couldn't see, and of young children having 'friends' - spirit beings - who visit them. Young children are especially open to this because they arrive with their full range of psychic potential before ignorant parents, child psychologist s, and 'Education' cl ose them down. In these circumstances, children soon learn that switching off their inter-dimensional abilities is less hass le than using them. The Illuminati power structure wants th e population to perceive only the world of the five senses, and our societie s are almost entirely aimed at entrancing the senses of sight, sound, taste, touch and smell. People are so much easier to deceive and control when they are detached from higher sources of information, intuition and inspiration. This was the mo tivation behind the creation of the 'this "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"23 world is all there is' version of 'scien ce', the one that dominates the schools and universities to this day. The major religions are also used to defend the walls of this reality by labelling those who co mmunicate with other dimensions as servants of the Devil. Hundreds of t housands were killed during the Inquisition alone for having inter-dimensional gifts. Wh en you say you are 'hearing voices' or seeing spirit visions' they condemn or ridicule you; but when you say the Christian 'God' is on the line or you have seen a vision of 'Mother Mary', they want to build you a shrine. The difference is that one challenges the belief system, while the other sells it. Animals don't experience this shut-dow n process, watch television or go to school and university, and they retain their ability to see beyond the frequency range of human sight. You often see cats r eacting to what appears to be 'empty space'. 'What's wrong with the cat?' people ask. Nothing is 'wrong'. The cat is just seeing something you can't see in a freq uency range beyond your five senses. You must have heard stories over the years of dogs and cats that wouldn't enter a house or room that was said to be haunt ed. The people involved don't see or feel anything, but the animals do be cause they are using the na tural sensitiv ities that society has closed down in so many huma ns. Comparatively few animals died in the devastating tsunami that hit Asia in late 2004 becaus e of their ability to sense the vibrations of danger. H.D. Ratnayake, deputy director of Sri Lanka's Wildlife Department, said: 'No elephants are dead, no t even a dead hare or rabbit. I think animals can sense disaster. They have a sixth sense. They know when things are happening'. Yes, they do, but this poten tial is suppressed in humans. After my awakening in 1990,1 began to regain some of the abilities th at lie dormant in everyone until they are triggered, and these have continued to expand. One aspect of this is to know something. You don't know how you know, you just do. It is not an arrogance that says, 'I know everything and you don't'; nor are you asking anyone to believe that you know . It is a state beyond mind, thought or emotion. You just know from somewhere ve ry deep. When I have a know even my body resonates in a particular way. I have thought things that were not right, but thought is a much lower level of percepti on, as we shall see. A know has never let me down and this has proved invaluab le in charting a path through the misinformation (thought to be true, but is n't) and disinformation (purposely given to mislead) that was coming from all si des as I sought to uncover the truth of what was really happening behind the veil of public statements and the TV news. I began to realise that th e conspiracy was much bigge r than just a group of families seeking global cont rol. In my meetings with a stream of people with knowledge and experiences to share about the 'other world' co nnection, it was clear that the 'human' network of the Illumi nati was only one level of a multi- dimensional conspiracy. The ra bbit hole goes far deeper than even most conspiracy writers believe or are prepared to invest igate. The next level of manipulation beyond the 'human' Illuminati involves entit ies in another dimension or realm that is very close to this on e on the frequenc y spectrum. You could think of it as two radio stations close enough on the dial to interfere with each other. These entities "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Figure 8: Human sight can only perceive an almost immeasurable fraction of the matter/energy estimated to exist in the universe and yet still people ridicule the su ggestion that we are not alo ne because they've never seen an 'alien'! Hysterical take many forms, but the key one appears to be rep tilian in nature. I have met hundreds of people in more than 40 countries who have claimed to have seen these other-dimensional beings and they mostly describe their appe arance as reptilian. I outline in other books the reams of folk lore and ancient accounts throughout the world that refer to the same reptilian entities th at people report se eing today. Credo Mutwa, the Zulu shaman, or Sanusi, calls them the Chita uri - the 'Children of the Serpent' or 'Children of th e Python', and he talks about them at great length in the Bridge of Love video/DVD seri es called The Reptilian Agenda. A recurring theme of the ancient and mo dern accounts is the way these entities can 'shape-shift' between a human and reptilian form. This will sound fantastic to most people, but when you appreciate the illu sory nature of th e 'body', it will be much easier to unders tand how shape-shifting is possible. The body is not 'solid', it just appears that way to th e five senses, as we will pursue in mo re detail shortly. The body is a vibrating energy field a nd the shape-shifting is not between two 'solid' forms, the human and reptilian; it is a switch betw een fields of resonating energy. These other-d imensional reptilians 'wear' a human body like a spacesuit while manipulating from behind the vibrational veil. This veil is what we call the electromagnetic spectrum and human sight can 'see' a mere fract ion even of that (Figures 8 and 9). We can only see so-called 'luminous matt er', which reflects electromagnetic light; but 95 per cent - at least - of the mass in the universe is known as 'dark matter/energy'. This doesn't reflect light a nd therefore cannot be seen, although it can be measured by its aff ect on the 'seeable' universe. What is called 'ordinary matter' makes up some 4.5% of the ma ss. This can be potentially seen by technology, but on ly a minimal amount has be en observed so far. The 24"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"25 Figure 9: Even within the electromagnetic spectrum on ly a fraction - 'visible light' - can be accessed by human vision electromagnetic spectrum is only 0.005 per cent of th e estimated mass of the universe and yet human sight can see onl y a minute fractio n even of these electromagnetic frequencies. Imagine how in finitesimal must be the figure for how little of the known universe human sight can perceive! Our eyes can see only one tiny frequency range of the electromagne tic spectrum called 'v isible light' - the colours of the rainbow between red and vi olet. (Many animals ca n see further into the electromagnetic spectrum.) As one write r put it, humans are virtually blind. So our eyes can detect only a fraction of th e electromagnetic spec trum, which itself is only 0.005 per cent of kno wn energy/matter, and s till enormous numbers of comatose people (including 'scientists') ridicule the suggesti on that we are not alone or that other forms of life, very differe nt from humans, could possibly exist. How breathtakingly absurd and these are th e very ones who laugh at others! But because most people believe wh at the 'experts' say, this nonsense is perpetuated in the public mind. The Reptilians and other non-human entities operate in the realms unseen by human sight. When they do move in and out of our tiny frequency range they seem, to human witnesses, to suddenly 'app ear' and 'disappear', but, in fact, they have only entered our frequency range and then left. They have not disappeared, just exited the frequencies that our lim ited sense of sight can access. When our five senses look at these Illuminati families, like the British Royals, the Bushes, and so on, we see their five-sense form - apparently human. But behind that mask is the reptilian entity vibrating on a sli ghtly different frequency and controlling the thought processes and actions of the 'human' level. Put most simply, the human body is 'possessed' by the reptilia n, which is able to hide from public view, and the population has no idea who is really in control (Figures 10 and 11 overleaf)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Figures 10 and 11: We see the 'human' form of the Illuminati bloodlines vibr ating within the frequency of 'visible light', but they are 'possessed' by reptilian and other entities operating in the realms beyond human sight This explains why the I lluminati families have obse ssively interbred over thousands of years in our pe rspective of time. The motiv ation is not only snobbery, as some believe. DNA is a frequency field th at carries the data for what we call our genetic nature and inheritance. The closer the frequencies are on the dial, the more interference there will be. In other words, the more connection between them there will be. The reason fo r the interbreeding, an d why the upper levels of the Illuminati are the same bloodline, is because their DNA carries a frequency field extremely close to, and compatible with, the reptilia n entities operating ju st beyond the range of the five senses. This sympathetic re sonance allows the Reptilians and other entities to 'possess' - take over - these bodies (Illu minati families) far more effectively than the huma n population in general. All human bodies have a huge amount of reptilian genetics, including the R- complex or reptilian brain (Figure 12). Th is is the oldest part of the brain, according to scientists, and gives us character traits such as cold-bloodedness where there is no empathy with the victim s of our actions; 'territoriality' and a desire to control; an obsession with hierar chical structures of power; aggression, and the idea that might is right, winner ta kes all. These are the very characteristics always displayed by the Illuminati and their agents. This is no surprise because the more reptilian genetics we have th e more we are likely to display such 26"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"27 behaviour. Interestingly, the top of the Reptilian manipulating hierarchy has been connected by researchers to the Draco star constellation and certainly the word 'draconian' encapsulates their mindset. When we speak of beings from other planets and star systems, this does not necessarily refer to the 'physical' level of them within the visible light range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Everything is multi-dimensional and there are, for example, many frequency levels of the earth that we cannot see, where other civilisations exist. Wh en people talk of life on other planets they refer only to the 'physical' five-sense reality, but planets have multiple realities vibrating on other wavelengths. Just because other planets of the solar system appear 'lifeless' to our sight and technology doesn't mean they aren't teeming with life on other frequency levels. The whole focus of the rep tilian brain is survival an d the Illuminati seek to control us through this fundamental fear. The war on terror is blatantly manipulating the fear of not surviving, and George Bush 's entire 2004 American presidential campaign target ed the reptilian brain to co nnect survival (protection from terrorism) with a Bush presidency. Th is reptilian fear of not survivin g is so powerful that around half the voters in America gave an idiot a second term because the man who ha d killed tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, caused more than a thousand troops to die, triggered vi olence around the world, and took away their basic freedoms, was cons idered the best gu y to keep them sa fe! The reptilian brain is about fight-or -flight, attack-or-run, hu nger and fear , and reacts overwhelmingly to what is called 'visceral stimulus-response'. Th is is to respond with emotional reaction, rather than reason ed thought. Does that describe a Bush voter, or what? The reptilian brain also react s most powerfully to visual stimulus rather than verbal, an d this is why the political spinne rs take so much trouble over the presentation of political ev ents with the emphasis on vi sual image, rather than verbal substance. An article in the Los A ngeles Times highlighted another expression of the reptilian brain - greed and excess. It was headed: 'Living Ever Larger; How Wretched Excess Became a Way of Life in Southern California'. French anthropologist G. Clotaire Rapaille is quoted as saying: '... The desire for excess comes from the \"rep tilian brain,\" the earliest, most primitive structures in our mental evolution.

When it comes to a choice between the intellect and the reptilian, the reptilian always wins. 'Satisfying that inner lizard has its downsides. Our insatiable appetites have left Americans 9 pounds heavier, on average, than we were two decades ago, and more vulnerable than ever to heart disease and diabetes. We're racking up mountains of debt (the late fees we pay on credit cards have more than tripled since 1996, to $7.3 billion a year) and burning up fossil fuels like crazy. We demand things that, deep down, we don't really want or even use.' This is the mentality of th e Illuminati and they have structured society to target the reptilian brain in the population. The Illuminati secret society network manipulates its bloodlines into positions of power in politics, banking, business, media, military etc., and the reptilian entities possessing those bloodlines run the show while the rest of the population can only see thei r 'human' level (Figure 13) This is why American presidents have ha d such astonishing 'blue blood' genetic ancestry going back to the royal and aristocratic fami lies of Europe and further afield. I have highlighted in my books the si gnificance to the Illuminati of Charlemagne (742-814), also known as Charles the Great, the King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor (Figure 14 overleaf). It is no bizarre coincidence, therefore, that 35 of the 43 presidents from Washington to Bush descend from the German- born Charlemagne; nor is it coincidence that Adolf Hitler and th e Nazis were also obsessed with the guy. Hitler's home at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria look ed out at the Untersberg Mountains where it was belie ved the spirit of Charlemagne was residing until he rose to make Germany great again. The Nazis were a creation of the Illuminati and were especi ally influenced by a stra nd in the network known as the Bavarian Illuminati, officially created in 1776. This organisa tion also controlled prime players behind the formation of the United States. Presidents are not ejected by ballot; they are selected by blood - reptilian blood. On an other level this is better described as selected by resona nce - reptilian resonance. It actually goes even further than this, as I will explain later. The Bush family is descen ded from Vlad Dracul , or Vlad the Im paler, the 15th century ruler of a country ca lled Wallachia, not far from the Black Sea in what is now Romania (Figure 15 overlea f). This region was once calle d Transylvania, home of the vampire legends, and Vlad Dracul was the inspir ation for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Vlad the Impaler slaughtered tens of thousands of people and impaled many of them on stakes. He would sit down to eat amid this fore st of dead bodies, dipping his bread in their blood, and he usually had a horse attached to each of the victims' legs as a sharpened stake was grad ually forced into thei r bodies. The end of the stake was oiled and care was taken that the stake no t be too sharp because he didn't want the victim dying too quickly from shock. In fants were often impaled on the stake forced through their mothers' chests. Nice man. Vl ad Dracul was an initiate of the Roya l Court of the Dra gon, also known as th e Brotherhood of the Snake, formed in Egypt from around 2000 BC to advance the powe r of the reptilian"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" bloodline (see The Biggest Secr et and Children of the Matrix ). The British Royal Family is also related to Vlad Dracul's blood line through Mary of Tec k, the grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II. The 'royal' connection to the Illuminati bloodlines is simple to explain. Aeons ago in what we call time, interbreedi ng began between humans and these reptilian and other entities. This is the origin of the constantly recurring stories throughout the ancient world about the 'gods', as th ey were perceived, interbreeding with human women. The best-known version is in th e Bible, which tells in Genesis of the Sons of God who interbred wi th the daughters of men to create a hybrid race called the Nefilim. The texts from which the English version was translated referred to the sons of the gods, plural, not the sons of a singular God. Almo st every culture throughout the world has a similar story, in cluding the Sumerian s (4,000 to 2,000 BC) in what is now Iraq. Their accounts told of the interbreeding wi th a non-human race called the Annunaki, and the hybrid children this produced. In southern Africa the same tale was told about the Chitauri, the 'Children of the Serpent'. Everywhere the story recurs, as does the theme of shape- shifting. In Asia, they had ancient gods 30"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"31 they called the Nagas, whom they said could take eith er human or reptilian form. These hybrid human-reptilian bloodlines became the 'royal' families of the ancient world and the idea of the 'Divine Right to Rule' was born. In truth, this 'right' was claimed b ecause certain families had a ge netic link to the 'gods' and acted as hybrid middlemen or 'demi-gods '. It was they who became the kings, queens and emperors. In China, emperors cl aimed the right to rule as descendents of the 'serpent gods' and the foundation of Chines e culture, of course, is the dragon, an ancient symbol for the Reptilians. The an cient kings of Media, near what today is Iran, were known as the 'Dra gon Dynasty of Media', or the 'descendents of the dragon', and in Children of the Matrix I show how the theme of reptilian gods and their hybrid kings and quee ns is a global phenomenon. Th e same hybrid bloodlines are still in the positions of power today as political le aders and those who control the banking system, tr ansnational corporations, media etc., hence the 'royal' genetic background to the dynasty of United States presidents from Washington to Bush. Babylon, in modern-day Iraq, is a crucial part of the story of the Illuminati and their bloodlines because it was once one of their ancient stron gholds. The hybrid bloodlines expanded ou t of Babylon, Sumer, Egypt a nd elsewhere to rule not only Rome (thus the Roman Empire), but th e whole of Europe. They became the European royal and ar istocratic families and Brita in, France and Germany became major Illuminati operationa l centres, especial ly London or Baby lon-don. In the same way that the Illuminati were behind the Roman Empire, so they spawned the British Empire, the biggest ever known, or at least recorded. This, and other European empires, became the means through which the hybrid bloodline was placed in power across the world, including what became the United States of America. When the European empires apparently with drew from their former colonies it was only a slei ght of hand to deceive the pe ople. They left behind the bloodline and the secret society networks that manipulated the bloodline into power, and they have continued to contro l those countries ever since. The only difference is that they have more power now because at least un der colonial rule the people knew who their masters were. Toda y they think they are running their own countries when, in fact, a hi dden force has its hand on the tiller, and the politicians that the people think they have elected to lead them are only puppets. My other books have all the background and sources to support what I am describing here. As I have been exposing for years in considerable detail, the Illuminati families continue to practice the same blood drinking and human sa crifice rituals they have been performing since the ancient world - no t least Babylon. This includes some of the most famous families and people on th e planet, like the British Royal Family, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Bushes and a long list that I reveal in other works. Vlad the Impaler, an ancestor of the Bushes and Windsors, was an infamous example of the obsession with blood drinking and ritu al sacrifice. The Dr acula character he inspired was a shape-shifting vampire with the title of 'Count', symbolic of the way the Reptilian bloodlines have been carried by 'hum an' royalty and aristocracy. Dracula is not just make-believe. His like ex ist and they are in po sitions of national and global power. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion The rituals are designed to achieve many things, including the interbreeding I have described. I should stress that this does not have to happen only through physical sex between a huma n woman and a Rep tilian entity. I have been told by women who have been raped in satanic r ituals (several of th em under the Mormon temple at Salt Lake City) that whilst a 'human' man was having sex with them he was overshadowed by a non-physical entity channelling energy through the rapist at the time of orgasm. These energies - frequencies - recode the DNA of the resulting child into the freq uency pattern of th e Reptilian or othe r entity so making the child compatible for 'pos session'. You could think of it as rewriti ng a computer program or adding additional information to a disk. What holds the information on a computer disk? - a magnetic field. It is the same pr inciple with DNA and this theme will be develope d in the next few chapters. In fact, the more we understand about the nature of DNA, it is clear there are other ways to rewrite its program. The rituals performed by Illuminati initiates also create an energy environment that allows the Reptilians and others to cross from thei r dimension into this one. Many people who have participated in these ritu als against their will have told me of seeing Reptilians and othe r entities manifestin g during the ceremonies, and of 'human' participants shape-shifting into reptilian form. They are obsessed with blood drinking becaus e it carries the fre quency, DNA codes and life force of the victim. Just as electricity pa sses powerfully through water, so it is with the life essence energy carried in th e blood. (By the way, Roma n Polanski's 1968 movie, Rosemary's Baby, portrayed this interbre eding and involved a reptilian entity.) Another reason for the rituals, especially involving human sacrifice, is that other- dimensional Reptilians feed off human fear. That is their prime en ergy source because they appear to operate in an 'in-between' world that Giuliana Conforto, an Italian astrophysicist and esoteric resear cher, calls the 'interspaces' (Figure 16). These lie between this dimension and the ne xt one, at least from our perspective of reality, and they might even be like vibrational crevices within our dimension, too. Credo Mutwa, the South Afri can Sanusi and offi cial historian of the Zulu nation, told me that in his culture they call th e interspaces the 'heav en between heavens' and 'that's where the Reptilians are', he said. In the third of the Matrix movies they had a similar concept, the in-between world controlled by a computer program called the Train Man. Interspaces don't have an energy source like dimensions do. They are, by comparison, sort of neutral zones, ga ps in the fabric of our reality from which we can be manipulated mentally and emotionally. Anyo ne operating there would need to create an ener gy source, which they have - us. They are harvesting fear, and they have st ructured the world to generate as much as possible in the form of not only sheer terr or, but also fear of the future, worry, guilt, regret of the past, depression, frustration and stress in all its forms. These are th e very emotions and states of mind that the system I de scribed earlier is guaranteed to produce. The human sacrifices engaged in by these world famous Illuminati names, and others, are structured to induce maximum terror in the victim and trigger an adrenalin release that enters the bloodstream in moments of extreme fear and stress. This is like an elixir to the Reptilian Satanists and th ey drink the blood of the "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"33 victims as soon as they are killed, often before, when the adrenalin is at its most powerful. The concentrated fear and terror of the victim is also being absorbed by entities in the inte rspaces, which are extremely close vibrationally to our 'human' reality. This is the origin of the ancient theme of people making human sacrifices to the gods. The energy the entities want most is that of prepubescent children, especially young girls with blonde hair and blue eyes. Red hair is another trait they seek. It has nothing to do with how these girls look; it is what these genetic characteristics reveal about the frequency and make-up of their DNA field. The sacr ifice of young girls is, once again, the origin of the ancient theme of sacrificing a 'young virgin' to the gods. Almost everyone accepts that these things did happen, but what most people don't realise is that they still do and many of the milli ons of children who go missing every year end up on the satanic altars of the rich and famous, or their underlings. (While this book was at the production stage I received information and pictures from a therapist in Australia that yet again supports the satanic abuse/reptilian connection. See Appendix II.) As I entered what we call the 21st century, many pieces in the puzzle were coming togeth er. The world was controlle d by a network of secret societies manipulated by the Illuminati, who had structured the world to create maximum fear and stress. This was feedi ng the Reptilians and ot her entities in the interspaces, and the more wa rs, conflict, terror, despair and grief that could be generated by human events, the more power the Reptilians and company would have to recycle back agains t us, and speed the rate at which this energy-generator "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion called human 'life' would sp in. 'Life' is getting quicker and more stressful and fearful because they are uppin g the spin speed of the generator - human societies. The world government structur e I have describe d (microchi pping in particular) is designed to control us and ha rvest our energy ev en more effectively. But there is, you will be delighted to know, a way out of this , as I will come to later. Staggering as this informa tion will be to so many, ev en the Reptilians are only another level of the story. It is far, far bigger than that . The guiding force I have been aware of since my awakening experiences in 1990 is now leadi ng me to the next layer of the cosmic maze, beyond the Reptilia ns and even the r ealms of dimension and vibration. In short, the world we think we see is an illusion that we have been manipulated to believe is r eal. This is the foundation co nspiracy that has spawned all the others and this know ledge is the key to ending our enslavement. My focus has always been drifting into these areas be cause it is a prime interest of mine, but from the turn of 2003 it bega n to take centre stage and some incredible revelations have been communicated to me. Carol, a psychic friend of mi ne, told me some months before I started this book that I would now be dealing with informa tion that could not be proven, but that people needed to know. This has certainly turned out to be the case. While much of what I am going to say is supp ortable by even mainstream sc ience, a lot of it is not. Or, at least, not yet at this point in scient ific knowledge. But th at doesn't mean it's not true and it doesn't matter anyway because I'm not asking anyone to believe it. If it doesn't make sens e to you, bin the book. What you be lieve is your right and no business of mine. Proo f is only what someone accepts to be so, anyway. One man's proof can be another man's non sense. I know that the themes I am a bout to describe are correct, but I am not aski ng anyone to accept that th ey are. People must decide for themselves what they make of it. How deep does the rabbit hole go? Far d eeper than most pe ople can begin to imagine and certainly further than they ar e prepared to explore. I'm ready to go anywhere, no matter how appa rently bizarre, because I want to know the truth and the answer to the age-old question: What the fuck is it all about?

I'm not sitting in a darkened room coming to these conclusions while smoking a weed; this is main stream science. Our eyes only transform light into electrical signals that are constantly delivered to the brain for interpretation. This 'visible light' is conf ined to a tiny fraction of th e electromagnetic spectrum, which is, itself, only 0.005 per cent of th e matter/energy in the known universe. It is within this minuscule frequency range that we decode Tight' into 'physical' reality. The eyes don't send im ages to the brain of three- dimensional st reet scenes or forests or children playing in the park, or anything else that we think we are seeing outside of us. They send electrical signals. Only when the brain decodes these signals into an apparent 3D real ity does the world we believe is 'around' us actually exist (Figure 17). There is no world 'around' us as we perceive it; everything is all happening in our brains, or at least at one level of the illusion it is.

We only 'see' what the brain tells us that we see and, as experiments have shown, that is decided by what we believe we see. There is no such thing as 'the' universe because there's a universe inside every brain, each with a different perception (Figure 18). The electrical path of a single thought can now be tracked by the latest scanning technology, and what we believe dictates which path is taken. Note that word - believe. We can now begin to appreciate the deeper reasons behind the Illuminati control of 'education' and the media, especially television. If they can implant in human minds a set of programmed beliefs abou t the world and wh at is real, those beli efs will edit, via the brain, what people 'see'. This editing pr ocess will construct reality to match what they believe they should be seeing. In th is way we put in detail that supports the preconceived belief and take out that which is at odds with it . What we think we see is dictated by preconceived ideas a nd that's why the system is constantly seeking to implant them. What do we call the information that television presents to us? Television programmes. Television is tell-a-vision or, even more accurately, sell-a-vision. Political elections, not least in America, are not about di scussing issues and what the candidates would do in office; they are aimed at implanting an image to edit the reality of the voters. These are the simplis tic mantras and lies th at politicians and their spinners parrot by the hour. This is so effectiv e that in November 2004 they managed to convince around ha lf the American el ectorate that George W. Bush was the one to protect them from terrorism when (a) he is a terrorist of monumental proportions; (b) his decisions have led to the murder of tens of thousand of Iraqi "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"37 civilians and, at the time of writing, the deaths of we ll over a thousand American troops; and (c) he sends others to fight his manufactured wars while spending his life making sure that he neve r sees so much as a bullet fired in anger. But once the belief in 'John Wayne Bush' is implanted, the br ain edits reality to fit. Another example is to watch two pe ople talking who have prec onceived ideas about each other. Neither hears what the other says or how they say it because their entrenched belief is editing the words and tone to fit what they believe about the ot her person. We are doing this with every image that we think we see. I told a story in Tales from the Time Loop about a hypnotist who was hired to entertain guests at a pa rty. What happened was witn essed by Michael Talbot, author of an outstanding book called The Holographic Universe (HarperPerennial, New York, 1992). A guy calle d Tom was put into a hypnotic state and given a potato to eat while thinking it was an apple. To Tom, it looked and tasted like an apple because the belief implante d by the hypnotist wa s editing his rea lity as his brain decoded the electrical signals from his tongue. The hypnotic suggestion simply reinterprets the signals, in this case from a potato to an apple. This applies to all of the five senses. There is a condition called synaesthesia in which the senses become confused and signals are interpreted by the wrong sense. I saw a British television documentary in which a man called James Wannerton deco ded sound into taste. He had a different taste for ever y word. Each time he heard th e name 'Derek', he tasted earwax; and the name of another customer at his pub gave him the taste of wet nappies (how did he know??) . I'd find a friend who tasted like red wine myself. Other 'synaesthetes', as they are called, see colours wh en they hear or see words. A lady called Dorothy Latham told the prog ramme that when sh e hears words she also sees them as like a coloured ticker ta pe apparently in fron t of her. When she hears music she sees a riot of colour. Ev erything is a frequenc y in this reality, including colour, and what can be decoded as sound through one sense can be decoded as colour through another. With synaesthesia the senses get confused and this is what hypnotists (and the Illuminati) are doing - impl anting false beliefs that cau se the brain to decode electrical signals to fit the beliefs. It is like repr ogramming a comput er and I have seen demonstrations of how easy it is to do . This includes transforming atheists into religious believers in a matter of seconds and these are the mind-games played by those evangelical 'white-suits' at the mass 'conversion' a nd 'miracle healing' rallies. The stooges on stage, and the audience as a whole, are put into a trance-like state, open to hypnotic su ggestion. Suddenly, 'I give my life to Jesus' (and my money to the 'ministry') is their new re ality. They say 'Jesus is in my heart' when, in fact, the white-suit is in their head. Many fraudulent 'psychics' use the same techniques. When someone says a medium has been 100 per cent accurate, it is often because their implanted beli ef has filtered out all that was false. The hypnotist at the Michael Talbot party told Tom that when he returned to a waking state he would not be ab le to see his daughter.

The hypnotist asked if he could read the inscription on th e watch and Tom did so. All the time his daughter was standing between him and th e watch! Impossible? Fantastic? Not at all. The hypnotically implanted belief that his daughter wasn't there edited her from the information Tom's brain wa s receiving, and when his 'reality' was neurologically constructed she was no longer to be seen. With his daughter removed from his personal illusion - or movie - there was nothing to stop him seeing what was behind her. It is worth pondering on this story when you next believe without question in what you are seeing. When I asked the Zulu Sanusi, Credo Mutwa, why more people didn't see the reptilian entities, he said it was b ecause they are so at odds with human reality that the brain removes them from what it 's ees'. This is one reason why some people see ghosts and others don't. The my stic, Sri Aurobindo Ghose, said that most humans possess a 'mental screen' that keeps us from seeing behind 'the veil of matter'. Clearly this is correct and the 'veil of matter' is the visible light within the electromagnetic spectrum. So what is real? Whatever you believe it is or can be manipulated to believe it is. For instance, we are programmed to believe in scarcity of food , resources, water and all the rest. But how can there be scarcity in an illusion? Only if you believe in it. Albert Einstein said that we don't observe nature as it actually exists, but nature exposed to our methods of pe rception. The theories dete rmined what we could or could not observe. That's right, but he co uld have gone further a nd said that there z's no nature as it 'actually exis ts', except as illu sion. The human race is in a hypnotic trance every bit as much as any subject in a hypnotist's st age show; even more so, in fact, because the stooge on the stage only has one hypnotist wo rking on him for a short time. In everyday life we are all being bombarded with hypnotic implants. When we're young we have parents and te achers telling us what is real and possible, and throughout our lives we have the media and peer pressure doing the same. Just as the subject in the stage show is told there is an elephant in the audience, or that he's eating a banana when it's really a lemon, so we are told that Osama bin Laden orchestrated 9/11, and th at doctors and mainstream scientists know what they're talking about . He didn't and they don't, but if we believe such rubbish we will construc t our reality to fit. As a resu lt, we will support the war on terrorism; take prescription drugs that often do us even more damage than the ailment they are treating; and accept th at when a scientist says Infinite Consciousness does not exist then it must be true. Techniques like the Total itarian Tiptoe and Problem-Reaction-Solution are major examples of the way the Illu minati attempt to implant a be lief that we will edit into a reality that suits their agenda . The human race is in a tran ce, seeing what it is told to see, in precisely the way that Tom was at the party. We don't have to seek"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"39 enlightenment and truth, we are already en lightened. We just have to wake-the-fuck- up, break out of the trance, a nd remember who we are. As psychiatri st R. D. Laing said: 'If I do not know I know, I think I do not know'. An other comment of his also encapsulates the human pligh t: 'We forget something; th en we forget we have forgotten'. That sums up ho w consciousness beca me caught in the illusion, or what I will call the Matrix. On e aspect of the New Age 'movement' are the 'Workshop Groupies' who go from seminar to seminar, guru to guru, trying to find something they already have. They don't find it beca use they are too bus y looking. We think that enlightenment is like finding the needle in the haystack when, in fact, it is the realisation that there is no n eedle and there is no hay. It is the trance-state that keeps us from this truth. The illusion goes even deeper than our beliefs construc ting our reality. I guess I started to appreciate this a few years ago when I had my first experience of seeing the backdrop of the cosmic computer game. It was like looking at the world through those 3D viewer things they call Viewmasters. They give you two vers ions of the same picture, one for each eye, and the brain turns the flat photographs into an illusory three-dimensional s cene. If you've ever experi enced this you'll recall how the 3D effect is really pronounced, far more than normal. I began to see the world like that, briefly at fi rst, and then for longer periods. It looked li ke the 3D version of something you'd get from Nintendo. Today when I walk down a street it's like I'm in a scene from a Matrix movie. I am not in the world; I am detached from it - observing rather than participating. It's al ways a shock when a nyone speaks to me in this mode because I feel invisible to people. When I look at the apparently 'solid' buildings and cars, it's like I could put my hand through th em. That may sound weird to anyone new to this , but how can they be anyt hing but illusion when they are only electrical signals decoded by the brain? The 'world' is not solid at all, merely an illusion of solidi ty. In one of the books of Ca rlos Castaneda, he quotes his shaman source, 'Don Juan', as saying: 'We are perceivers. We are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity. We are boundless ... We, or rather our reason, forget [this] and thus we entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime.' Quantum physics explores and tries to understand the subatomic realm of reality or, put more simply, it is the study of energy in waveforms and particles operating beyond the 'physical' reality of atoms and 'matter'. In these realms, the 'laws' of conventional physics (which are illusions anyway) are seen not to apply and the idea that the physical world is solid is shown to be impossible. The physical realm is constructed, scientists say, from atoms. This name originates, we are told, with an ancient Greek called Democritus, who made the first known claim that matter was composed of tiny particles that he called atoms. But hold on. If atoms are the building blocks of our 'solid' world, how come atoms are about as least solid as you co uld possibly imagine? In fact , they ain't solid at all! (Fig ure 19 overleaf)"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 I know I didn't go to university (thank you, God), but even uneducated (thank you, God) me can see a little contradiction here. How can something that is not solid be the building blocks that construct this 'solid' wall I am looking at now? It can't - our brains do it. With the emergence of quantum physics, science has had to concede that atoms are not solid. It knows that they contain even smaller particles consisting of a nucleus (made of protons and neutrons) that appears to be circled by electrons. The atoms that comprise 'physical' matter are overwhelmingly 'empty' and even illustrations of this are misleading because there is not enough room in a book or science paper to accurately depict the proportions of particles to 'empty space'. As one writer put it: 'If an atom was the size of a cathedral, the nucleus would be about the size of a ten cent piece'. The rest is 'empty' to the perception of the five senses because it consists of energy vibratin g on wavelengths higher than the 'physical', and even the particles are found to be empty as you go deeper into the subatomic realm. If you magnify anything powerfully enough a nd go deeper than the atom, you will find that nothing has solidity. No, not ev en buildings, cars, mountains or the bones in your body. It's Iluuuuuuuusion! If you find this hard to accept, think of your dreams. You dream in three-dime nsional images and yet no one claims they are solid do they? This reality is the same - a dreamworld that we believe to be real. I don't go into my virtual reality 'V iewmaster' mode by taking drugs; it developed without me doing anything cons ciously to make it happen. But the three occasions that I have take n so-called psychoactive drug s confirmed in detail the same recurring theme. We are living in a collective dream that we have been manipulated to believe is soli d and 'real'. As I describe at length in Tales from the Time Loop, in 2003 I was invited to speak at a gathering in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and this included the opportunity for participants to experience the psychoactive effects of a pl ant called ayahuasca. This has been used for at least hundreds of years by South American shaman s to take people into other states of consciousness that the five senses can not access. It cont ains many powerful hallucinogenic properties including Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a naturally occurring component of the metabolism of mammals and plants. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"41 Ayahuasca is known as the 'teacher plant' and the 'plant of the gods' because it allows people to experien ce unseen realms or dimensio ns where so much can be learned about self, life an d reality, and where the ' gods' of myth reside on frequencies outside the range of the five se nses. Indeed, the organisers invited me to the event because of the number of times that previous participants had seen reptilian entities and imager y in their altered states of awareness. But again, all these realities are al so signals decoded by the fr equency fields we call the brain/body. The drug simply changes the na ture of the decoding process and plugs you in to another information source. Some people have great experiences with the plant while others go into really dark mental and emot ional states. It depends on the person and where their mind takes them. My two experiences were incredibly powerful and transformed my sense of reality. I had long been aware that the 'world' was an illusion, but now came some serious detail. I took the ayahuasca over two nights in th e form of a liquorice -tasting drink in a small glass and I lay back on a mattress amid the darkness of a big, round, wooden building in the rainforest. After about an hour I began to enter altered states of awareness. I saw swirling colours and images at first when I closed my eyes, and I went deeper and deeper through levels of consciousness until I reached a state of indescribable peace and bliss. It was beyond fear, doubt, guilt and regret; beyond time, and ev en vibration. All was stillness or sometimes like a slow- motion wave. In the first session only Zoe, the facilitator, and I were in the room. As the ayahua sca kicked in, I began to speak in a voice very unlike my own. The words were not preceded by thought; they just emerged slowly and powerfully without any help from me. It began with 'I am love', and then, 'I am everything and everything is me, I am infinite possibility '. With that I felt energy begin to stream from the centre of my chest and fill the room. The human energy field in this reality is interpenetrated by a series of vortices known as 'chakras', an ancient Sanskrit word meaning 'wheels of light' (Figure 20). The one in the centre of the chest is "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion called the heart chakra and this is the real origin of the idea of feeling love in your heart. It is symbolised toda y as the physical heart, but love is expressed through the heart chakra or vortex that connects us to the love of all that is, a connection the manipulators are desperate to suppress w ith their mind games and microchips. I would stress that all this relates to this reality because chakras are illusions, too. The power of the energy coming through me was fantastic. It was like someone was squeezing my chest at the point where the energy seemed to be pouring into the room. A strip light on the ceiling began to flicker on and off, and then three of the lights came on full power. I wondered why the lights had been turned on when the session was supposed to be in da rkness. But no one ha d touched the light switch and they came on without electric ity, empowered by another form of energy. The music player also turned on and off, but as I felt the energy streaming from me I could understand why the electrical circuits were going haywire. The flow changed and I felt it arch from my chest to my head like some unseen rain bow. With that I began to speak fluently in my alte red state. The words told of an Infinite Consciousness, referred to as 'The Infinite ', 'Oneness' and the 'One'. Everything was Infinite Consciousness, the words sai d. Division and polarity were illusions of the manufactured virtual reality that I call the Ma trix and beyond the veil of illusion everything was One. There was no me or we , just an Infinite T. Even within the virtual-reality game everything was the sa me Oneness and it was only the illusion that gave the impression of division. The difference was be tween Oneness in awareness of itself and Onen ess that had forgotten what it was. Whenever I talk about Oneness from now on I am referring to Oneness in awaren ess of itself, as opposed to that caught in th e illusion of divisi on. The ancient Vedi c works of India tell a similar story. The eighth century Hindu mystic, Shankara, said: 'Brahman [Infinite Consciousness] dw ells beyond the range of Ma ya [illusion]. There is nothing else'. On the second night in Brazil, the aya huasca experience was even deeper and, as my consciousness tossed and swirled through realities, I began to hear a loud, clear, female voice speaking wi th great dignity and clarity. This was not, of course, a woman in a body speaki ng through a voice box. It was consciousness communicating telepathically and my brain was decoding these frequency fields into words that I could understand. I heard the words in English, but had I been Italian or Pakistani I would have decode d the consciousness fields into those languages. 'David', the voice said, 'we are going to take you to where you come from, so you can remember who you are'. With that I was ta ken to a realm of indescribable bliss, even more profo und and wondrous than the night before. There were no divisions, no polarities, no black and white, no us and them. There was no time, no place, no vibration. Everythi ng just was and this is a state of being that has to be experienced to be understood. I was not my body; I was consciousness, all consciousness, all that exists in any expre ssion. Everything just was. I was Oneness, Is-ness, All Possibilit y. But I was still self-a ware, an 'individual' with my own point of observ ation within the w hole. I was here and I was there. I was everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing. I was and I wasn't, and I "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"43 was all 'in between'. It may sound mumbo-jum bo, but it will be clearer later why encompassing polarities is the door to Oneness, completene ss. 'This is the Infinite, David', the voice said. 'This is where you come from and this is where you shall \"return\".' I was told that there was really only on e thing I needed to know and these words began to repeat over and over in my head : 'Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion'. I began to form a question in my thoughts: 'You really mean everything?' But before the thought could fully em erge, the voice interrupted. 'Infinite Love is the only truth - everything else is illusion; no buts, no exceptions, that's it.' The existence of one Infinite Cons ciousness is the only truth; everything else is the imagination of that Consciousn ess - illusion. I should also define 'Love' as used in this book. It's not the, 'I love you darlin', fancy a quick one?' version, or any other misrepresentat ions along the same lines. Love in the context of Infinite Love is the balance of all. Infinite 'Love ' is also Infinite In telligence, Infinite Knowing, Infinite Ever ything. Thus, it is and it isn't; it is everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing. It is Al l Possibility in perfect balance. The 'voice' spoke to me for some five hours and another veil lifted for me that night. I have begun to understand new levels of the game thanks to what I learned in the ayahuasca experience , the ever-expanding insight s that have followed, the knowledge given to me by the synchronicity in my life and, increasing ly, the way I am seeing through the 'solid ' world of illusion. These new levels ar e centres of awareness, control and manipulation from which the 'Reptilians ' and Tlluminati' are made manifest. Thr oughout the rest of the book I am going to describe reality as I have come to understand it from all these sources of information and insight. Much of it is supportable by evidence emerging at th e forefront of science, especially what is known as quantum physics. But I go further than that and so much will not be 'provable' in the sense that the hu man mind demands proof and people will have to decide for themselves what they thin k or, better st ill, know about what they read. It is not my desire to conv ince anyone that this is true or to tell them what their reality sh ould be; the Matrix does that well enough already without any help from me. So, here we go: the illusory wool that has been pulled over our illusory eyes. Oneness is Infinite Possibility with a limitless imagination to manifest anything and everything. This 'physical' world is only one example. Given th is, how silly it is to dismiss by reflex action the accounts of shape-shifting Reptilians and other non- human entities just because they are so diffe rent to what is perc eived as the 'norm'. There is no norm within Infinite Possibility and such myopia is indicative of just how caught-in-the-box most people are. As a car sticker I saw in California said: 'You laugh at me because I'm different; I laugh at you because you're al l the same'. Seven months after the experience in Brazil, I came across an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness had begun as a ripple that decide d to leave the ocean of consciousness - the 'timeless, spaceless and eternal'. When it awakened to itself in this 'disconnected' state, the myth said, it fo rgot that it was part of the infinite ocean and felt isolated a nd separated. This was pretty much what the voice told me in "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The creation of the Matrix, as symbolised by Neil Hague. First came imagination into 'form'; with that came the illusion of separation; this led to the manifestation of f ear (the winged entity) that took on a life of its own; and consciousness was caught in an illusion it believed to be 'real'. As a Hindu myth says, human consciousness began as a ripple that decided to leave the ocean of consciousness - the timeless, spaceless and eternal. When it awakened to itself in this 'disconnected' state, it forgot that it was part of the infinite ocean and felt isolated and separated. another way. I am constrained by the use of words because feeling or knowing something is much more profound than d escribing it in language. But, basically, the imagination of Oneness created an illusory real m, one of infinite such 'worlds' within Infinite Possibility. This 'world' began to forget it was Oneness, like a dream forgetting it is the dreamer. With this amn esia came the phenomenon we call fear, an expression of All Possibility that cannot mani fest within the balan ce of Oneness. Fear only comes with the illusion of division and separation when consciousness perceives itself as a part and not the whole. Fear is the shadow of illusory disconnection. Neil Hague's superb pictures (see colour se ction) symbolise the progression from Oneness to division and fear (Figures 21 to 26). First came imagination into 'form'; then the illusion of separation, which was fo llowed by the manifestation of fear that took on a life of its own. The creation of the Matrix Dreamworld was not good or bad, right or wrong. It just was. It 's not the structure of the Ma trix that is the problem so much as the force that controls it.

The Matrix is just that, a fictional cons truct of collective mind. This 'physical' level of the Matrix, what I call the Time Loop, was created to prov ide familiarity that eased the fear of the unknown cause d by illusory separation and was a very much more pleasant experien ce than it is in our real ity. You could think of the Matrix as a thought projec tion, like a movie projecti ng on a cinema screen. The projection was dependent for its survival on th e projector. But th e projection, the act of imagination, took on a 'lif e' of its own when it gained ac cess to its own source of energy. This source, the voic e told me, was fear. Now it was that the dream took over the dreamer. The Matrix - self-aware fe ar as the voice desc ribed it - developed an agenda of its own and sought to genera te as much fear as possible to empower and expand itself. The reason the Matrix need s fear as an energy source is because it is fear. The more fear its manipulations generate through wars, conflict, stress, guilt and aggression, the greater its power to increase this cycle of fear -production. As the voice was describing all this, I wa s shown scenes from the Disney cartoon movie, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which th e sorcerer created an entity to do all the jobs he didn't want to do, but then th e entity took over and became the sorcerer's controller. The story of Frankenstein is also very symbolic of what happened. Entrapped consciousness became controlled by its own fear in a labyrinth of self- deceit and manipulate d illusion (Figure 27). (I should explain how I am defining cons ciousness for the pur poses of this book. Everything is consciousness, but there ar e different levels of awareness depending on how connected something is to Infinite Oneness. To compare the consciousness of Oneness in awareness of itself with what we call hum an 'mind' is to compare Einstein with a baked bean. Indeed, the difference is so fantastic that there is no comparison. So when I speak of conscious ness in this book I mean awareness beyond mind, beyond the Matrix.) When we forget that we are Infinite Consciousness experiencing an illusion, everything else loses perspective. I was on a catamaran ferry one afternoon with my son, Jaymie, making the 15-minute crossing from mainland England to our home on the Isle of Wight. As we left the harbour, a mist descended which denied us sight of land in any direction. Normal ly, the ferry follows the mainland coast for a few minutes and then turns sharp right and he ads for the Island. Independently of each other, both Jaymie and I began to wonder why we were not tu rning this time. We passed one of the big concrete 'forts' in the water which, even when the tide is low and the ferry takes the long way round, is th e last point at which the turn is made. But it still appeared to both of us that we were continui ng to go straight ahead and away from the Island. Just as we we re wondering what on earth was happening, the lights of the Island pier came into view and we realised that we had been going in the right direction all along. We had b ecome disorientated ('lost') by losing the key coordinate - sight of land. With th at it would have been obvious what was happening and the direction we were taki ng. But once that had gone, all other "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Figure 27: The virtual-reality game: entrapped consciousness, in a state of collective amnesia, became controlled by its own fear in a labyrinth of self-decei t and manipulated illusion that I call the Matrix 47"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" coordinates, like the fort, lost perspective. We had actua lly turned at the fort but, without having the land for reference, that wasn't obvious. This is what happens to us in the Matrix. Once we lose sight of the foundation c oordinate - we are Infinite Consciousness experiencing an illusion - we lose the point of reference from which to understand everything else . We think we are going in a certain direction (that we are humans in 'real' bodies experiencing a 'real' world) when, in fact, it's all a manipulated dream. One other point is that both Jaymie and I were caught in the same illusion and this meant that we we re confirming each other's reality and making it more 'real'. So it is with humanity - 'everyone knows that'! The Frankenstein Matrix is a super-hol ogram that feeds us the dreamworld. Dennis Gabor discovered holograms from the late 1940s and won the Nobel Prize for his work. He turned a three-dimensi onal object into a frequency pattern on photographic film and converted it back to a 3D hologra phic image. Holograms are made by directing a laser onto a piece of photographic film (Figure 28). The laser is 48"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Figures 30 and 31: This girl and soldier look 'real' and 's olid', but you are looking at holograms that you could pass your hand through.

For more see www.holography.ru) directed at the film through a semi-transpare nt mirror. Some of th e light is deflected away in another direction and onto the object you want to photograph. Now you have the laser light poi nting at the film (known as th e reference beam) and the part deflected away onto the object (known as the worki ng beam). This working beam, carrying the vibrational image of the object in question, is then also directed onto the photographic film. Wh en it hits the film it 'collides' with the reference beam - its 'other half' - and this creates what is known as an interference pattern between the two. You can liken the princi ple to throwing two stones into a pond and seeing how the two wave formatio ns collide and interfere with eac h other. They form a pattern that is a wave representati on of the two stones , where they fell and at what speed. The interference pattern imprinted on th e holographic film looks much like the waves in the pond. It is a series of lines that ap pear to be random and incomprehensible (Figure 29). But when you shine the same type of laser light upon this pattern, suddenly an apparently three-dimensional image of the photographed object comes into view (Figures 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34). The images can appear to be solid, but you can pass your hand through them; and immediately you turn off the light the hologram disappears because it is only an illusion. Lasers are used because they produce a stable, focused beam know n as 'coherent light' and project a single 49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 frequency. Coherent light is that which holds a narrow, even beam over long distances and does not expand and weaken like the light from a torch. The Matrix, the virtual- reality game, is a super- hologram projecting endless other holograms, including the human body and, they are all, by their very nature, illusions (Figure 35). One of the amazing characteristics of a hologram is that every part is a smaller version of the whole. No matter how much you may cut the film into smaller and smaller pieces, when you shine the laser on them they will all give you a smaller whole picture. If you cut a normal photo into four pieces each of them will obviously contain a quarter of the entire image, but not with the hologram. Any part of the film will always give you a smaller version of the whole. The hum an body is, therefore, a smaller version of the entire Matrix hologram and I suppose you could say the Matrix made 'man' in its own image. This means that because the human body hologram has a brain, which communicates to all parts of the body and decodes the information coming back, so the Matrix as a whole must have a version of this. It communicates to its 'cells' (human bodies and other life forms) and processes the information it receives from them. This is how we receive our collective realit y and also change it through the signals we unconsciously send ba ck to the Matrix 'brain' - the central computer (Figure 36 overleaf). Every part of the body is a smaller version of the whole body and this is why every cell contains all the in formation necessary to create an entire human form. I'll "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"51 explore the health implications of this later as it solves many scientific 'mysteries'. Mainstream science has been unable to locate the area of the brain that contains all the memory because what we ca ll memory exists throughout the brain and body. This must be the case becaus e it's a hologram. People with tumours, who have large parts of their brains removed, do not lo se specific memories. They might not remember, in genera l, quite as well because they have moved to a smaller level of the holographic memory where there is less clarity than in th e whole. But they don't lose one memory completely and retain another in crystal clarity as they would if memo ry was located in one area. The body hologram stores info rmation from all the senses and so when we smell something it can trigger a memory just as powerfully as sight or hearing. Even this is another level of the illusion because if the brain is a hologra m it must also be illusory. It is, like everything in this reality, the 'physical' expression of a frequency field or resonance. Incidentally, the holographic nature of the body means the whole brain/body is involved in decodi ng the five senses and not just the 'visual cortex' and othe r areas of the brain associated with these specific duties. This is a perfect time to desc ribe the structure controlling our reality because we have computers, the Internet, holographic photography and television, which mirror the Matrix in so many ways. But I stress that when I say the Matrix is like a computer or software program I am only using this term to symbolis e the theme of what I mean because today's computer techno logy helps me to describe these concepts. When it comes to the Matrix, even the most fantastic of today's comput ers and software is like comparing roller skates with the space shuttle, and even that gap does not tell the full story. By the way, if you know nothing about comput ers, and we tend to assume that everyone is aware of this stu ff now, software is a set of electronic instructions that the computer reads and responds to. Another bonus in describing our illusory world is the Matrix movies, which have provided a brilliant visual representation of the virtual reality we are experiencing. I couldn't believe it when the first one came out because it has been such a great tool in communicatin g what I was trying to explain with only words be fore.

One of the big questions people ask is why, if we are creating our own illusory reality, do we all see the same basic world in stre et scenes, people, cars, roads, forests and mountains? The answer is that we are being fed frequency signals by the force manipulating the Matrix and we decode them into the collective reality we call the world (Figure 37). We add our own spin to this in that we differ in our opinions of what we collectively 'see'; but we all share the same basic reality because we are decoding the same signals from the Matrix. This reality is not out there, it is 'in here' - inside our heads. Or, more accurately, it is in our genetic data bank, DNA. As the writer Edgar Allan Poe put it: 'All we see and seem is but a dream within a dream' ... a hologram with in a hologram. In the late summer of 2004,1 met a friend, Mike Lambert, from th e Shen Clinic on the Isle of Wight in England. Mike is a healer forever pushing back the bou ndaries of his profession in pursuit of greater understanding. As usual, this has not made him popular with the medical authorities and even those who seek to dictate the norms within so-called alternative or complementary therapies. I have yet to see a hierarchy of any kind that did not act out the same characteristics of control of events and defence of the status quo. What the hierarchy represents is irrelevant; it is the fact that it is a hierarchy that creates the replicated mindset. Even anti-hierarchy hierarchies behave the same - see the 'radical' and anarchist organisations for confirmation. 'Right, order, order, your anarchist comm ittee has decided what the rules will be.' To see this attitude controlling the altern ative-therapy arena is sickening. Anyway, in the 1980s Mike Lambert wrote a pape r well ahead of its time about DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. This is the body's genetic library found in every cell and we all have some 120 billion mile s of the stuff.

Holy shit, I thought. This is it! This is how they do it - this is what plugs us into the Matrix. It's the DNA! When you look at the graphic of DNA structure it is a double helix which, when unravelled, looks like two ladders (Figure 38), although some researchers believe there were once many more. The winding stairway in Freemasonic symbolism relate s to DNA because it is the key to human control and the same symbol can be found in the secret mystery schools of the ancient world. The sequences of A, G, C and T decide the genetic characteristics, what your body looks like or whether the form is a mouse, elephant or daffodil (Figure 39), and * Figures vary depending on the source and I have also seen the figure of 90% quoted. Whatever the precise figure, it is the overwhelming majority of DNA that science is yet to understand 54"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" there is another player in this that I'll come to shortly. The DNA differences between species are far less than their similar ities. Ninety per ce nt of the DNA in humans and mice is the same and there are enormous parallels between human DNA and that of a housefly. As an article in th e San Francisco Chronicle said:'... DNA is a universal software code. From bact eria to humans, the basic instructions for life are written with the same language'. And this language is the language of the Matrix. If you saw DNA massively magnified it woul d look like a snake (Figure 40) and, not by coincidence, a major symbol th roughout the ancient world was the double helix snake image known today as the caduceu s (Figure 41). This is the symbol of the medical professi on. DNA, the foundation of 'physical' form, has a reptilian-like appearance and the most ancient part of the human brain is known as the R- complex or reptilian brain. I' ll come to how the Reptilian s and Illuminati fit into all this in the next chapter. What we think of as 'physi cal' is actually a holographic illusion, and the base form of DNA, as with everything, is a frequency field, a sort of floppy disk or CD holdi ng the genetic program. We ne ed to think in computer terms to understand most simply how it all works. When we procreate we see the physical expression of this with sperm from the father fusing with an egg from the moth er, and the baby developing from this union. But on an energy level, beyond the holographic app earance of 3D, it is two software programs' being copi ed onto anot her disk. The DNA of father and mother are downloaded and the result is a 'disk' or program cont aining a fusion of both - the baby. This is how genetic characteri stics and defects ar e passed on. A download containing a computer virus or flaw will be passed on to the new 'disk', the 'next generation'. The body is created from one fertilised eg g (program) and this is copied 55"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"56 over and over until the adult human has between 50 and 100 trillion cells. Each one contains the same library of instructions that are read according to their function, just as a computer reads software. The reader of the body software is called RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which is usually found in the form of a single strand. To keep it simple, the DNA is like the disk or template and the RNA is like the laser that reads the information on the disk and communicates it to the cells (Figure 42). The RNA decides cell function by which information it chooses to transcribe from the DNA and deliver to a cell. Transcribe one set of DNA data or 'language' and it's a brain cell; select another sequence and it's a cell in the liver. One part of the RNA decodes the DNA information and another decides which information to decode. The understanding of RNA - how it works and what makes its decoding decisions - is still far from fully understood by mainstream science. But here is another massive key to the creation of reality. These RNA decisions can be made by the Matrix via the DNA or through the intervention of consciousness to override the body program. They are also affected by mental and emotional influences like stress and trauma, and electromagnetic and chemical pollution, including additives in our food and drink. These can destabilise the RNA reading process and cause translation mistakes that lead to disease. All of these factors, and more, can affect how the R NA reads the DNA and this is fundamental to both ph ysical and mental he alth, and our sense of reality. This is important to understand because, while the DNA stores the data, it is the RNA that chooses which data to select and manifest. The com puter may have the hard disk, but the computer operator decides which information on the disk to activate and use. RNA is the laser reader deciding which sense of reality we will experience - as with the example of the hypnotised Tom who could not see his daughter. The RNA read his reality through the DNA in line with his programmed belief that she was not in the room. How the R NA reads the DNA also decide s our physical and mental health. It can decide to read a genetic flaw or ignore it. So fro m now on when I talk "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"57 about DNA or the DNA network, I am includ ing in these terms the work of the RNA and its choices of what to transcribe and communicate. Incidentally, it is said that 'practice ma kes perfect' and this is true because the mind/body is like a computer reading software. When a soccer player practices a skill over and over the resulting data is do wnloaded onto the 'disk' and can be accessed later when he's playing a matc h. As the ball comes to him in a certain situation, the 'compute r' will react according to down loaded data. Pr actice well and you perform well, and vice versa. When I am coaching my son, Jaymie, at goalkeeping, I always say practice as you'd like to play because the computer doesn't distinguish between practice and match - it just reacts to the input it has recorded for a given situati on. It's the same with an y skill you want to develop although, no matter how much you practice, some will be have a greater 'natural' aptitude for certain things than others because of th e base program they have 'inherited' in the first place. What struck me most about Mike Lamb ert's paper was the relationship between DNA and the receiving and communication of information. DNA , he pointed out, was a crystal that emi tted light energy in the form of photons to such an extent that it had been compared, by so me, to an 'ultra weak laser' (the same with RNA). The cutting edge of scientific research is beginning to unde rstand that DNA is a perfect antenna/transmitter. One Internet article said: 'From the characteristic form of this giant molecule - a wound double helix - the DNA represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna. On one hand it is elongated and thus a blade antenna, which can take up very well electrical pulses. On the other hand, seen from above, it has the form of a ring and thus is a very good magnetical antenna.' It is through this receiver/transmitter that we are connected to the Matrix. I have been saying and writing for two years that our reality was like a holographic Internet. Our bodies are ak in to computers connecte d to the World Wide Web (Figure 43 overleaf). The computer can trav el through the collective reality that we call the Internet, visiting a news site, sports site, environmental site, porn site, whatever. It can also comm unicate with other computer s via the Web through what we call e-mail and networking, when computers link up and work together. All the computers in the world connected to the Inte rnet share the same collective reality, the same matrix. Humans also share a collec tive reality and we can surf our illusory web of holographic c ountries, people and interests. We can follow the news (news site), play sports (sports site), work for environmenta l groups (environmental site) or seek to roger ever y man or woman that takes our fa ncy (porn site). The principle is exactly the same. Our collective 'physical' reality is a like a holographic Internet and our bodies are bi ological computers. We unders tand how the World Wide Web is constructed through telephone lines and cable networks, but I wanted to know how our collective reality wa s generated. When I read the line abou t DNA being a crystal communicator and receiver of laser-type light, I had my answer. The Matrix was unveiled. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" Insights began to flood my mind as this realisation developed. The DNA was in effect, the computer terminal through whic h we logged into th e Matrix and were fed its collective reality - the illusions that hold us in slavery. Einstein said: 'Reality is an illusion, albeit a persiste nt one'. The persistent bit is the virtual-reality game transmitted by the Matrix super-hologram to the body holog ram via DNA The RNA then decides which of the program to re ad and manifest as 'reality', a decision made through a combinati on of programming, mental and emotional state belief and, for those who are awakening - consciousn ess. I had long said that most people were controlled in their thoughts, response s and reactions by the genetic traits of their bodies the software pr ogram that we inherit from our parents and the genetic line. I saw the body as a bu cking horse that ou r consciousness had to subdue and 58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"59 harmonise by expressing its reality over that inherite d genetically, or through society's programming, by th e body or 'horse'. I felt th at the 'horse' (DNA) was in control of their actions and reactions, and not the 'rider' (consciousness experiencing this world thr ough the body). In such people, an inherited genetic trait like alcoholism would be repeated in their own expe rience while those with consciousness more powe rful than the DNA progra mming would be able to override it and avoid the repetition (the RNA decides to read the program differently from the alcoholic parent). DNA /RNA is like a computer re acting to the data it rece ives. This data can come from the Matrix, our consci ousness, or through programs affecting other programs. The latter includes the way human society is manipulated to program the people with a false reality. I recalled in Tales from the Time Loop how I was walking in an altered state on the only other occasion I ha ve tried psychoactive substances , in this case 'magic mushrooms'. The voice was ta lking to me again as I came across a horsebox parked in the street with a horse and rider alon gside. The voice said that the analogy of th e horse and rider - b ody and consciousness - was valid. Imagine, it said, that the 'incoming' consciousness has to cope with all those inherited programs, beliefs, and assump tions of reality carried in the DNA. It said: 'Do you wonder any longer why people are so easy to manipulate when they inherit that genetic programming to start with?' Most people expe nded so much energy coping with the inherited responses, reactions, desires and demands of their DNA that they had little left to look up and see beyond the illusion . The DNA is decoding the signals from the Matrix into a holographi c illusory world and it also connects with the DNA of other people and life forms to create the human collective mind. This holographic Internet - the Matrix - is what we call 'Creation'. It is not only inherited genetic software th at is held in our DNA. This is continually being added to and rewritten by the messages it is receiving from the Matrix, consciousness and th e programming of 'society'. This is what is called 'evolution'! For example, it is the brain/DNA and its in formation loop with the Matrix central computer that leads to ch anges in animals to match their changing environments and circumstances. In the Be ginning was the Word - Microsoft Word - and the story is constantly changing in response to the information sent and received by the Matrix and other sources. The DNA/RNA is a biological computer, reading interactive software programs in the same way that the crystalline brain decodes electrical signals from the senses and turns them into sight, s ound, smell, taste and touch - the illusory holographic wo rld that exists only in our heads. The brain is to the body wh at the central processing unit, or CPU, is to a computer. The central processing unit , or central processor, is re sponsible for co ntrolling and reading all communication s traffic and it is the most im portant part of the computer system. One explanation of the CPU I sa w actually called it the 'brain of a computer' and the human brai n is the CPU of the body co mputer. The healing art of acupuncture is based on the lines of energy flowing aroun d the body called meridians. In Figure 44 (overleaf), you can see the meridian system picked out by a gamma camera after radioactive tracers ha d been injected into acupuncture points. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 This is a computer-enhanced version of an image produced in a study at the Necker Hospital in Paris held in conjunction with the Cytology Laboratory at the Military Hospital. I know what the meridians remind me of - a circuit board. This energy, known as chi in acupuncture, consists of photons carrying information around the body computer under the guidance of the ce ntral processing unit, the brain. The chakra system also conn ects into this network. After I had written this chapter I came across research at the University of Florida that confirmed still further the 'c omputer' nature of DNA. They grew a 'brain' in a laboratory from 25,000 neural cells extracted from a single rat embryo and taught it to fly an F-22 jet simulator! It was part of a research project to develop a new breed of 'living' computer that has th e ability to 'think'. It is possible for rat cells to fly a jet plane in the same way that you dow nload software on to a "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"immm Reality 61 This is what is happeni ng every day to humans. Our DNA computer cells are downloading data from the Ma trix and 'society', and th ey are taught to respond according to pr ogram, just like the ra t cells with th e simulator. Th e only way to override this DNA programming is through the interven tion of consciousness. When we do this, the resonance of the bod y hologram increases with the spin speed of the particles as they respond to th e higher consciousness we are accessing, Consciousness then dictates events thr ough the DNA and not the low-vibrational program. Incidentally, the development of bi ological computers that can 'think' is a dangerous road and the potential conseque nces were superbly portrayed in the Matrix movies when the world was taken over by machines that could think. (Indeed, has it already happened?) The takeover by the biological computer machines in those movies mirrors the way the Matrix has been hijacked by self- aware fear. Messages are co nstantly being passed betwee n the DNA computers of people, animals and all life, and this is a furthe r extension an d expression of the Matrix. This is how we can communic ate without words with animal s, trees and flowers, as experiments have shown, and how we pick up good or bad 'vibes' from people no matter what their outward demeanour might be. It is a bit like sending vibratory DNA e-mails, I guess, or 'd'-mails, you might say. You have d-ma il - the guy across the room is a con man. 'Hey, Ethel, I get bad vibes from that guy across the room.' These DNA computer-terminal connections ar e what we call the collective mind or, as the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, termed it, the 'collective unconscious'. I have written many times about the so -called 'hundredth monkey' syndrome. This was the discover y that when a few members of a species are ta ught something new, suddenly all, or most, of the species begin to do the same instinctively without being shown. They may tell us this phenom enon is mysterious, but it's very simple, even more so as we understand the nature of the DNA 'Interne t'. The monkeys, or whatever species, communica te the new knowle dge via their DNA by the very act of learning and realisation. It is like finding new information and posting it on the Web to make it available to everyone logged on. In this case, the 'everyone' is the rest of the species operating with the same DNA codes and the same broadcast frequency. This is how all species communicat e, and why they do so more efficiently with each other than with other species. They shar e the same DNA codes and transmit and receive on th e same wavelength. This happens between the human species, too, and the system seeks to keep us divided to undermine the power of the collective unconsciou s to rewrite reality. As I mentioned, we have 120 billion miles of DNA and our bodies are monumental computer terminals that can process unbelievable amounts of information both coming in and going out. In fact, more than enough for us to receive and hold manifest the collective ill usion we call the worl d, or the cosmos. The Matrix controls consciousness trappe d within its vibrator y walls by holding it in a false reality that it believes to be real. This is done by c onstantly broadcasting a 'world' as frequency, or wa ve, fields to the DNA com puter terminal s and the DNA, through the brain /RNA, decoding these br oadcasts into the holographic form that"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion we call the physical, or five -sense, universe. Some resear chers say that the synapses, which communicate information betw een nerve cells in the brain, are fundamentally involved in this process. The principle is similar to television, which decodes frequencies, or waveforms, broad cast from a transmitter into pictures on the screen. The only real difference is that DNA/RNA does this holographically to give the illusion of 3D - although hologra phic television is al ready being talked about. It was the discoveries of the Frenchman Jean B. J. Fourier in the 18th century that led to both television and the di scovery of holograms. He developed a process called Fourier transform, a math ematical method of converting patterns into simple waveforms and back again, so providing the potential for a television camera to convert pictures into electromagnetic frequencies and the television to convert them back again. Scientists have discovered that the human brain operates on the principles of Fourier transfor m - it is a frequency decoder. Precisely! At the end of the 1970s, research by Russell and Karen DeValois, two neurophysiologists at Berkeley Univers ity, revealed compelling evidence, since supported by countless other scientists across the world, that the brain is decoding frequency patterns and turning them into holographic images that we 'see' (or think we do). The brain cells in the visual cortex react to different frequency patterns and activate according to the types of frequency they receive. I would suggest that it is decoding the fr equency signals, the waveforms broadcast by the Matrix, into the illusory holograms of the 'physical' world, although I would say the whole brain is involved in this and not just the visual cortex. Indeed, it involves more than even the brain. The entire body, all 120 billion miles of DNA (along with RNA), is involved in the decoding process. For well over a century it has been known that the ear is a frequency decoder, and experiments by Georg von Bekesy, another Nobel Prize winn er, have long confirmed that the skin responds to frequencies. The voice in Br azil told me that all five senses are frequency decoders and now we can see why - the decoder is the brain and the DNA/RNA operating in every cell. As I said earlier, DNA (like RNA) emits light-energy in the form of photons to such an extent that it has been compared by some to an 'ultra weak laser'. They generate coherent light in the same way that our technological lasers do - the lasers that create holograms. The Matrix broadcas ts its signals in wave, or interference, patterns and it may be that the laser light emitted by the DNA/RNA is part of the process of turning them into holographi c representations of that waveform - people, animals, houses, streets, forests and landscapes. This is the computer-game scene that I increasingly see as I walk or drive around. One mystery of quantum physics is how particles ca n either express themselves as a 'wave' form (non- physical) or as a particle (apparently 'p hysical') and the wave forms only become particles when they are bein g observed - when we are looking at them. What is actually happening is that the DNA/RNA/ brain is causing the waveform or interference pattern to project an illusory hologram. The act of 'observation' - focus - projects the holograms from the waveform s and when this happens the quantum "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"63 physicists see the waveform 'becoming' a particle. Both the waveform and the particle (waveform observed as a hologram by the DNA /RNA/brain) ex ist at the same time and they don't move from one st ate to another. When a laser is shone onto a photographic interference pattern to manifest a hologram, one does not replace the other. Both waveform and hologram (particles) coexist. It is just that the observer sees the hologram as the prime reality. The waveform is possibility; the particle is 'physical' experience. Karl Pribram, a neurophysi ologist at Stanford University, has been at the forefront of understanding the holo graphic nature of physical reality. Michael Talbot writes of hi s conclusions in the Holographic Universe: '... [Karl] Pribram [realised] that the object ive world does not exist, at least not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What is 'out there' is a vast ocean of waves and frequencies and reality looks concrete to us only because our brains are able to take this holographic blur and convert it into sticks and stones and other familiar objects that make up our world ... '... In other words, the sm oothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom limb syndrome [when amputees \"feel\" a limb long after it has been removed]. 'According to Pribram, this does not mean there aren't china cups and grains of beach sand out there. It simply means that a chi na cup has two very different aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we'd experience it as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion? \"Both are real to me,\" sa ys Pribram, \"or, if you want to say, neither of them are real.\"' I know that convention al scientists will mock the idea that the laser emitted from DNA/RNA is powerful enough to be involv ed in the manifestation of holograms, including its own 'body'. DNA is claimed to have the laser powe r of only a single candle, but there are two po ints to make about that . Firstly, the DNA laser is coherent light, focused and concentrated, as opposed to a candl e, which diffuses its light and power; sec ondly, the DNA laser is far more powerful than a single candle, as science will eventually discover. The ability to measure so mething is dependent on the advancement of the technology used to do it. Try measur ing the accuracy of the most advanced computer with coun ting-beads. The true power of DNA/RNA operates on frequencies that human technol ogy cannot yet measure and in ways it does not understand. If your radio dial is not properly tuned to a station it can sound weak, quiet and fuzzy, but hit th e right frequency and the same station could blow your ears off. Science may think it is ad vanced in its knowledge of DNA, how it works, and the power of its laser emis sions, but, compared with what there is to know, mainstream science is still hunting mammot hs and going 'Ug, ug'.

The other 95 to 97 per cent they basicall y know bugger all about. So how can they pontificate on what DNA can and can't do - the same with RNA? They call this other up to 97 per cent 'junk DNA', as if it doesn't do anything of significance. Let me go through that again in case y ou missed it or you're still trying to lift your jaw from the floor. They call this other up to 97 per cent 'junk DNA' as if it doesn't do anything of significance. What is it there for, then? Was 'God' taking the piss? 'Science' refuses to see the elephant in the living room no matter how much it may dump on the carpet - the official version of reality (Figure 45). In fact, the more it dumps the more establishment 'scientists' hold th eir noses, cover their ears and stare at the floor. For example, get this professor. Do you think that by any chance these might be related?? • We cannot perceive, even with technology, at least 95 per cent of the mass in the universe known as dark energy and matter, and what we 'see' with our eyes is a minuscule fraction of what exists. • 95 per cent of the brain's ac tivity does not relate to th e waking state or 'physical reality'. • Scientists call some 95 to 97 per cent of DNA 'j unk DNA' becaus e they don't know what it does.

It re aches the conclusion first and makes the 'evidence' fit. So much is being received, transmitted and processed by DNA that we are not aware of because 'scientific' re search is limited to the frequency range its instruments can measur e. Outside that (tiny) range they're basically fucked. There is no 'junk' DNA; it all has a purp ose and that's up to 97 per cent more purpose (at least) than we know about! The brain alone receives 400 billion pieces of information every second, but we are aware of just 2,000. What's more, experiments have reveal ed that electrical signals necessary to move a limb, open your mouth or take any 'physical' action, begi n some half a second before sensory signals arrive in the brain to be translated into action. Who or what is tapping the keyboard here? It is said that we use only a fraction of our brain's capa city, less than ten per cent in most cases. I say that this 'unused' capac ity is operating at fre quencies that science has not yet measured and connects us with realms way beyond electromagnetic light (or that's what it is meant to do). This is the connection the ma nipulators work to suppress. I suggest that fund amental to this is the corp us callosum whic h links both hemispheres of the brain a nd regulates information pass ing between th em. It also dictates which hemisphere will govern perception and behaviour at any point. The left side (which dominates 'modern' society) deals with the 'logical', analytical, judgemental and verbal; the ri ght is about the creative, ar tistic, intuitive , visual and emotional. Clearly, the corpus callosum is key to the pr ocess of either intergrating this brain duality into a uni fied whole or keep ing us 'in two mind s'. If information passing from right to left is suppressed, the person will be 'thi s world' dominated and far less intuitive. It is worth noting that the 'education' system is almost entirely aimed at the left side of the brain with th e right-brain stimulator s, like music and art, way down the list of priorities and cont inuing to diminish. The most successful students are therefore left-b rain prisoners, and they ar e the people who go on to administer the system thro ugh politics, banking, busines s, medicine, science and media. It is no surprise that they perpetuate the left-bra in society the Illuminati has sought to impose. There are billions of neurons in the corpus cal losum that are a mystery to science and they have no idea wh at they do. It will eventually be realised that this 'brain-bridge' is part of the transmitter/receive r system that connects us to 'out there' and to each ot her - as with the hundredth monkey syndrome (Figure 47). The hypothalamus at the base of the brai n is another vital regulator of the body and it works closely with the pituitary gland, the 'maste r gland' of the endocrine system, and the pineal gland, the so-calle d 'Third Eye', through which we manifest 'psychic sight'. The endocrin e glands connect the body to the chakra system and this network links our 'physical' reality w ith the wider universe of unseen energy. What are called psycho-activ e drugs - like ayahuasca - op en us consciously to those areas of the brain and DNA that in teract with these other realms. There's another crucial point to highlight about DNA: it is al so the home of what we call the mind and emotions. This is the greatest deceit of all that holds us in servitude to the Matrix because we acce pt that our instinctive responses and"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"67 reactions must be coming from us; they must be who we are. As I've said, everything is consciousness, but there are different levels of awareness. When I use the term 'mind', I mean thoughts emitting through and from DNA and not consciousness in its 'Oneness' state. The mind is a software program connected to the Matrix, as are emotions. We believe our thoughts and emotions are our own, but they are the program playing out its pre- recorded responses and reactions. You'll notice that when we feel emotions there is an immediate physical affect. Our heartbeat quickens, the mouth dries or we feel sick in the stomach. Emo tions cause bodily reactions because that is where they are located - in the DNA. Once again, the hypothalmus in the brai n is a prime regulator of our emotional state. One Internet explanation said: '... The Hypothalamus organizes and controls many complex emotions, feelings and moods, as well as all motivational states including hunger, appetite and food intake, and everything to do with the concept of pleasure including satisfaction, comfort and creative activities. The neurons in the Hypothalamus produce a number of Hypothalamic neurotransmitters which relay information and in struction to all parts of the body ... The Hypothalamus ... is intimately involved in t he integration of all physiological stimulation, all 5 senses ... which it then translates, distils and assembles into one discernible \"package,\" relating all the attr ibutes of an experience ...' The hypothalamus is an excellent exam ple of how the physical, mental and emotional ('all attributes of an experience') ar e processed through the same source - the DNA/brain. I should define what I mean by the te rm Emotion in this book because I know some writers believe that emotions are ei ther our conn ection to the One', or that the One is thei r origin. I have heard it said that we connect to Oneness through the emotions of joy and happiness, but I don' t perceive these as emotions. I say that true joy and bliss are natural states of Oneness - as I ex perienced in Brazil - and they don't need a name to describe them called 'e motions'. They just are. Oneness is bliss and joy ... love. When we open to Oneness beyond the program we "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 experience these states be cause they are the nature of the One. These are not emotions; they are a state of Oneness. Emotions under my definition are programmed reactions that disconnect us from awareness of th e One and we don't know what real joy, bliss and happiness really is within the Matrix flytrap, unless we connect with the One. We judge our state of 'happiness' by our level of unhappiness. 'Oh I feel a lot le ss unhappy today, so I must be happy' That kind of happiness is emotion, but no t the Oneness variety that de fies any label. I suggest that what we understand as emotion (inc luding illusory 'happine ss') is a software program designed to enslave us and I will develop th is theme later. Emotions are phenomena of the DNA ho logram. If you rub your hands over your body and press with your fingers, you will usually find areas that are uncomfortable when there is no 'rational' reason why. Alternativ e healers, involved in what they call 'body work' or kinesiol ogy, locate these areas very skilfully and my goodness they can hurt. These points of discomfort are un processed emotions stored in the body (often as toxins) and when the locatio ns are massaged the freed emotions are often expressed through anger, tears and so on. This stored emotion is actually information held in the hologram and is akin to a hard drive on a computer holding saved data. It's like a computer operator saving something he doesn't want to deal with immediately. The body-work heal ers are, in effect, pressing the delete button. People say things like 'I am only human', and they talk of 'human nature', as if this is who they are. But it 's not. They are the consciou sness of Infinite Possibility and what we call 'human' is the DNA mind, emotions and holographic 'body'. What makes us 'human' is the Matrix interactive soft ware program in the DNA, and we confuse th is with who we are. It is also what makes us men, women, black, white, young or old. These are programs and this misunderstanding is at the very core of the illusion. We are not our bodies, mind or emotions. We are Infinite Consciousness. An article in The Scotsman newspaper in 2004 featured the research of David Hamilton, a scientist who cha nged his views on life after ex periencing a firewalk. It was clear that if you could walk through fire without ge tting burnt there was just a little bit more to know about the nature of reality. The article explained how Hamilton became convinced that our ment al and emotional states can not only affect our health, but actual ly change the DNA. Yes, they can, and the re ason is that they are the DNA. When one part of a computer chan ges, it affects the whole computer because the data passing through th e system is changed. So it is with our changing mental and emotional states that affect the balance of the DNA and thus our 'physical' health. This is how the placebo effect works when people regain health after taking sugar pills they belie ve are powerful drugs . The belief in the 'drug' rewrites the DNA (and/or tells the RNA to read the program to match the belief) and manifests the 'cure' they believed the treatment would bring. David Hamilton said he had found some 500 scient ific papers from mainstream academic journals which confirmed the effect that thought, feeling and faith (belief) have on the body's systems, and he highlighted in particular the work of Eric Kandel, joint "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Figures 48 and 49: The stunning effect of thought and words on water crystals. The crystal in Figure 48 formed after water was exposed to words of love and appreciation'; in Figure 49, the words were 'You make me sick - I will kill you'. The difference makes clear the power of wo rds, thoughts and emotions to affe ct the world, not least the human body, which, in this reality, is mostly water. (For more examples see the books, Messages from Water, volumes one and two, by Masaru Emoto) winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000. Kandel has concluded that many genetic differences between people are in fluenced by society and conditioning and are not just inherited from pa rents. These influences caused genes to switch on or off and this is the DNA comput er system reacting to changing inpu t. Hamilton cited a scientific study of rat pups which show ed that two separate growth hormones are switched off in those deprived of a mother's touc h. He went on: 'There is a whole branch of medicine called psychoneuroimmunology, which studies the effect of thoughts and emotions on our bioc hemistry. The biochemis try is intimately connected with the DNA, so if these .. . components are affected by thoughts and emotions then thoughts and emoti ons must also affect our DNA.' Yes, because they ar e DNA! The brilliant work of Japanese scient ist, Masaru Emoto, at the I.H.M.-Institut e in Tokyo, has revealed how water is fundamentally affected by words, th oughts and emotio ns - all of which are waveforms. He and his team exposed water to various music an d different words and expressions, and then froze it to produce water crystals . When these were examined under a microscope the response of the water was amazing. In Figures 48 and 49 you can see the way the crystals responded to the words and thoughts (vibratio ns) of 'Love and appreciation', and, 'You make me sick - I will kill you'. Imag ine the effect on the body hologram of our words and deeds when it is some 70 per cent water (this figure varies by age and weig ht); and these attitudes, an d states of being, rewrite the DNA in the same way that they affect water crystals. (I have to laugh when I 69"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"70 hear people say that planets have no ef fect on us - within the illusion - when our bodies are 70 per cent water and the mo on alone can move the tides across entire oceans!) Incidentally, it is not the words that have the effect, but the intent behind them. If you said T w ill kill you' in a li ght-hearted, jokey fashion, it would not have the same effect as it would if you meant it , or said it with ma levolence. Thought and emotions produce wave forms and quite obviously music does. Music can be healing and inspiring or extremely detrimental, depending on its vibrational impact. I also saw a documentary that showed how the brain forms networks of electrical connections in response to me ntal and emotional st ates. The longer these states continue, like depression, and worry, the more this networ k 'solidifies' and becomes the reflex-res ponse system of the brain. It is li terally like programming a computer and the brain edits reality in lin e with the program that the mental and emotional state has downloaded. But th e moment we change our thoughts and emotions, say to enthusiasm and optimism , these electrical connections break up and re-form to reflect the ne w attitude. Thoughts and emotions can be measured as chemical reactions because th e pituitary gland in the br ain, interacting with the hypothalamus, releases chemic als known as peptides in response to emotional changes, and these chemicals attach to receptors on the cells. Whether it is a chemical form of what we ca ll 'love' (in its human sense), or 'hate', or even a drug like heroin, they all connect with the cells through the same receptors. I have written in other books about what I call emotional addiction when people require a constant fix of an emotion, be it anger, depression or 'love'. One main reason for this is the addiction to the chemicals secreted by the hypothalamus/DNA network when emotions ar e felt. In the words of the Robert Palmer song, for exampl e, people can be 'addicted to love'. As with all addictions, there can be a need to constantly increa se the dose to get the same effect and humans are subconsciously creating situations in their lives to give them the emotional fix. Such people will create ci rcumstances in which they can get angry, worry or become depressed, while others will jump from partne r to partner saying, 'I fall in love so easily'. They are addicted to the melodrama because they are addicted to the chemical fix it supplies. Dr Candice Pert, author of Molecules of Emotion: The Science Behi nd Mind-Body Medicine (Scribner Book Company, 1999), said: 'At any instant our body is in our mind and our mind is in our body'. This is because mind and body - and emotions - are expressions of the same DNA. What we call 'personality' (mind and emotions) is a DNA pr ogram and we have been kidded to believe that this is who we ar e. When we ride a horse we don't believe that we are the hors e, do we? But with the body, and its mind and emotions, we do. I have heard it said by psychologists that there is only a sma ll number of what they call archetypal 'personalities'. Some say there are no more than 12 basic ones. The Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, sought to connect these ar chetypes to genetic inheritance and believed them to be ins tinctive. He said we are born with these patterns that structure our imagination and make it distinctly human, and he suggested that archetypes are very closely linked to our bodies. Jung identified the "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"71 archetypal patterns in every culture and period of human histor y, and found that they mirrored the same arch etypal 'laws' in all cases. He suggested that a 'Universal Unconscious' was behind a ll this. Humans did not have separate, or personal, unconscious minds and instea d shared a single Universa l Unconscious, Jung said. What we call the conscious mind was rooted in this, he believe d, and to him the mind was shaped according to universal patte rns. I'd say he was right in all these assumptions, but that the archetypal pa tterns come from th e Matrix via the DNA /brain. The Matrix, at th is level of reality, is J ung's Universal Unconscious - the energy/matter that we can't see, which is constantly interact ing with the 95 per cent of brain activity not re lated to the waking st ate and to the 95 pe r cent or so of 'junk DNA'.* This is why, as he said, personality patterns are inherited and closely linked with the body. Too ri ght they are - thr ough the DNA. These are the patterns that, in his terms, make us 'distinctly human'. Th ey are the human software program. Like everything in this reality, 'humans' are a computer construct and not who we really are. Psychi atrists and mainstream ther apists who work with the 'human mind' are like com puter tech-support and hypnotists are reprogrammers. They are not dealing with consciousness wi thin the definition in this bo ok, but the mind - a software program. Oneness is All Possibility and yet human s overwhelmingly fall into a few basic archetypal personalities. How can this be? We see such a contradiction because the archetypes are not Oneness in awareness of itself; they are software programs downloaded and read by the DNA/RNA. Lo ok at the classic 'fight or flight' response, which comes from the reptilian br ain. When people or animals are faced with danger they either fight or run for it. Are they really the only choices in such a situation within Infinite Possibility? No, of course they're not. They are programmed reactions. Our emotional re sponses are almost entirely predictable for the same reason. I have known people in highly vo latile relationships who were simply reacting to each other according to DNA program. They pres sed each other's buttons and reacted in the same way every time. It is like tapping data into the other's computer and pressing enter. The Matrix wants us to react in this way because it leads to conflict and instinctive (programmed) behaviour that produces the energy that empowers the system. When some of th ese volatile couples saw what was happening and stopped reacting a ccording to program, bingo, the storm was over. Their consciousness began to ha ve the relationship instead of their DNA programs that r eact through what we call instinct. As I have mentioned, electr ical activity necessary for any 'physical' action begins some half a second before the conscious mi nd makes the 'decision' to act. Benjamin Libet and Bertram Feinstein, neurophysiologists at Mo unt Zion Hospital in San Francisco, asked people to press a button when they were touched. The outcome was that the brain reacted to the touch in 0.0001 of a second and th e button was pressed in 0.1 of a second. But the pe rson was not aware of feeling the touch or pressing the button fo r a full half-a-sec ond. The subcon scious programming makes * I stress again that these figures are approximate"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 the decisions and the conscious level is the observer and reactor - unless consciousness intervenes. Without that, the conscious and s ubconscious minds - both expressed through the DNA - will react according to program or what some call 'archetype'. Once you stop the progr amming governing your mental and emotional responses, a higher awareness - Infinite Po ssibility - can come in and override the archetypes. More than that, it can rewrit e the DNA/RNA program and attune it to Oneness, instead of the Matrix. Thes e programmed archetypal reactions are mercilessly exploited by the Illuminati. They know that if they input something, like 9/11, they are going to get a pred ictable DNA/RNA reac tion, which they can manipulate to advance their agenda. I saw an old First World War recruiting poster that called for the men of the Isle of Wigh t to attend a meeting aimed at persuading them to volunteer to fight fo r their country. It said that 'Patriotic airs would be sung' and, of course, this was meant to manipulate the men emotionally to react to 'love of country' by signing up to die. Emotions are the major access code to the body computer, including the mind. Now we have multi-channel television, Hollywood movies and the media in general, to whip up the emotiona l response to events that leads people to 'fight for their country' and support governments that send them to k ill and be killed. Unless we operate from a level of awareness beyond emotional re action, the Matrix will continue to construct our r eality. Problem-Reaction-Solution depends 100 per cent for its success on this response system, and the Fear of Not Surviving Program, located in th e reptilian brain, is the central ta rget. Are we go ing to let the Matrix dictate our lives through our DNA, or are we going to open ourselves to awareness beyond the Illusion and manifest that level of consciousness? When we do the latter we are in this world, but not of it, and I will go into this further in the final chapter. I wrote earlier how the mystic, Sri Aurobin do Ghose, said that most humans possess a mental screen that ke eps them from seeing behind the veil of matter. That screen is the DNA/RNA and the way it interprets reality through the body's central processing unit, the brain, within the tiny fre quency range called visible electromagnetic light. Astrophysicist and esoteric rese archer, Giuliana Conforto, wrote in her book, Organic Un iverse (Edizioni Noesis, Italy, 2004): 'We have to remember that the luminous matter we observe with our instruments is only 0.5 per cent of all calculated mass. W hat we see with our eyes is still less. \"Reality\" is a thin \"film\" of [electromagnetic ] light, a visible matrix, our biological body or robot can interact with; such a body is just a \"costume\" that lets us participate in the \"film\" itself for a while; it is not our true identity or \"I\".' So what is the Matrix? It is informati on, a ready-to-wear worl d and belief system broadcast to the DNA as frequ encies, and decode d into holographi c 3D collective reality. It acts like a voice talking in our heads, telling us what to belie ve is real. In the Matrix movies when they looked at computer screens full of moving green codes, they were seeing st reet scenes and pe ople. It is the sa me with our illusory"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"73 reality. Scientists and esoter ic researchers have identi fied recurring mathematical codes like the Fibonacci number sequence found throughout nature. This involves adding the last two number s to get the next one, as in 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21... . The sequence can be found in ev erything from the pr oportions of the human body to the way plants grow. Other mathematical and geometrical codes and recurring sequences include Phi pro portions, Golden Mean, so-c alled 'sacred geometry', numerology, the Chinese I Ching, astrology and many others. These are the mathematics of the Matrix wh ich, at least in this rea lity, can be broken down into numbers and codes, as with DNA. Appropriately, and not coincidentally, th is is how computers work. Everything you see on a computer screen , including the colours, are sequences of numbers using the binary system based on 1 and 0. This is an expressi on of the duality and polarity of the Matrix, like negative and positive, yin and yang. Many of the Illuminati symbols I have identified in ot her books, such as the pentagram, are codes that relate to the ma thematics of the Matrix and affect how DNA interprets reality. These are placed a ll 'around' us to manipulate the way we decode our reality into holographic expe rience. As I, and others, have long de tailed, towns and cities like Washington D.C. ar e laid out accordi ng to the geometry of the Matrix. The vortex points all over the planet that form pe rfect grid patterns are also part of this mathematical construct and the Matrix can be manipulated at these locations. Stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury, a nd the temples of the Illuminati secret societies, have been built on these vortices, and they are also targeted for satanic rituals. Everything can be expressed as numbers within the Matrix. Stephen Marquardt, an American doc tor, who has studied Fibonac ci number sequences with regard to the human face, correctly conc luded: 'All life is bi ology. All biology is physiology. All physiolo gy is chemistry. All chemistry is physics. All physics is math[s]'. He might have added that al l maths is energy and all energy is consciousness. The DNA/RNA network, in the act of 'o bserving' wave patterns, transforms them into holographic illusion and the an cient Greek philosophe r, Plato, was quite right when he said that human beings we re like people sitting in a cave always facing a wall. The universe was the shadows projected on the wall - illusions that the people mistake for reality. That is a pe rfect description of what I am outlining here. Everything you think you see, including your own body, is a hologram, a 3D illusion, which is fed to you to trap your consciousness in mesm erised servitude. Think moth. Think light. That's us and that's the Matrix. Wow."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR Past and Future on DVD The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius Oscar Wilde he Matrix sells us the illusion of passing fr om past to future wh en we are actually going nowhere. 'Time' is one of the most effective ways of enslaving us. Oneness is no-time and if we attune ourselves to the deceit of passin g through time we disconnect from awareness of the Infinite. How can you connect with someone standing still when you are hurtling past them in a sports car on your way from labour ward to cemete ry? Hey, look, there's Oneness ... Zeeeeowwwwwwwwww ... shit, missed him - and her. When people hear claims that past a nd future are happening together they usually dismiss the idea as ridiculous and impossible. After all, aren't we passing through the 'years' and getting 'older' by the 'day'? I understand the question, but days, years and ageing ar e all illusions that we manifest because we believe in them - or our DNA does. Given that everyone el se is ageing arou nd us, why would we not think it was real? But then everyone ag es because they are all caught in the same illusion. How can we age when th ere is no time? We can't. But we can experience the illusion of ageing when that is written into the Matrix software (again involving the hypothalamus and en docrine glands) and our consciousness falls for it. A hologram projected by a laser from an interference pattern never ages and yet our bodies - also ho lograms - go through a pred ictable cycle of young to old, birth to death. The difference is th at one hologram is programmed to age and the other is not. People talk about the power of mind over matter, but to rewrite the ageing software we need to have the power of consciousness over mind - higher awareness over DNA program . That's the way to ch ange all the programs. I have had some visions and insights ab out illusory 'time' while I have been sitting here writing, in fact they are hitting me li ke machine gun bul lets. Take the world we live in to be a movie you ar e watching on DVD. You press the button and the movie begins to take you from scene to scene. You are passing from A to B to C or, put another way, passing from past to future. But when you get, say, to the middle of the movie, the part you have just watc hed has not ceased to be. It is still there in the same form , it's just that the laser is now reading a different part of the disk. If you press stop and run back you'll find that exactly the same scenes you 74 T"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"75 have watched are still there. Ahead of you in the movie is the part you haven't yet seen, the 'future'. But fast forward and you'll find it is already there before you arrive in the course of scene following s cene at 'normal' speed. When you get to the end of the movie everything you have seen and experience d is still there for other people to experience or for you to watch again. The past, as you perceived it, is always there and so is the future. They are all happening at once, and past and future are illusions relative to where you are in the movie, or the software program. A sense of 'time' is based merely on the observer's pe rspective. This is why, as Einstein pointed out, when you are doing something you li ke 'time flies', and when you are in the dentist's chair it appears to 'pass' slowly. When you panic, time seems to pass very quickly, but not so when you stay calm. The very fact that time is relative to the observer mean s there is no time. It is a perception and not 'real'. Our manufactured official 'time' is linked to the earth's rotation and when that changes so does our 'time'. In America, you can drive across a state border and be in a different hour, and when you fly across the Internat ional Date Line you are instantly in a different da y. Time is an illusion. The theme of that DVD analogy is how the Matrix Time Loop works, as I highlighted in Tales fr om the Time Loop at considerab le length. What I call the Time Loop is the vibrational level of the Matrix that we think of as the physical world, the realm of visible electromagnetic light, and it appears to move from past to future. 'Time' is there to entrap us in the Matrix and detach us from consciously reconnecting with the Infinite that we are. What we ca ll past and fu ture is our illusory journey 'through' a software program or hol ographic movie on DVD. The Time Loop movie is always there to be experienced at whatev er point you choose, Imagine a storyboard on a wall and you choose to start at a certain place and walk along the wall following the st ory for a while before wa lking away. Then you might come back and read some mo re at another stage of the story ('reincarnation'). The basic backdrop - the world we see 'around' us - remains constant unless one of the following intervenes to change it: • The Matrix brain or centra l computer system changes the messages it transmits for us to decode into holographic reality. • Consciousness overrides th at program and sends its own instructions to the DNA/RNA/brain network. • Our DNA software is rewritten by expe rience or programming, as with the Illuminati manipulation of information and the suppression of alte rnative realities. It is not DNA or even the Matrix that is the problem; it is the nature of the program that they follow. There are actually multiple matrices or possible 'past and future' realities to choose from - ju st as you can have many diffe rent recordings on a DVD - and I will develop this point later. One of the unique characteristics of a holographic film is also that, unlike a conventional picture, you can have many images on the "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"76 same print. They are different interferen ce patterns, waveform s, and the various pictures are selected by the a ngle at which the laser strikes the film. This is the same principle as the laser passi ng across the wave patterns of the DVD picking out the scenes in order. What I am suggesting is that our DNA/ RNA decodes wave patterns broadcast by the Matrix in basically the same way and, as the angle of 'strike' changes, we move from scen e to scene as if we are m oving 'forward'. But. We are actually going nowhere. Does your DVD mach ine go anywhere while it is playing the Hollywood film that appears to 'move'? Do the actors go anywhe re or the backdrops for their scenes? Do we go anywhere when we are 'moving' around the Internet? No, we are just sitting there. We are not moving in our daily lives, either. Moving is an illusion because it's all going on in our brain. It 's like playing one of those virtual reality car-racing games wh en you appear to be speeding around a track, but in fact you are just sitting in a chair. You are no t moving; the game is. It's the same with the Matrix super-hologram. I go into modes some times, especially when I am driving, when I see the world moving in my mind while my body goes nowhere. The virtual-reality ga me is so clear to me in these moments. It's like the story of the two monks debating about the movement of a flag in the wind. 'The flag is moving', said one. 'No, the wind is moving', said the ot her. A third, passing by and hearing the conversation, said: 'The flag is not movi ng. The wind is not moving. Your mind is moving'. Remember in the Matrix movies how people were 'plugged in' to the Matrix through their br ains while 'they' stayed outside sitting in a chair without moving? It's the same principle. There is something highly significant abou t the angle at which we observe reality in the Matrix computer ga me. I saw a hologram in a shop a few years ago that showed a human face when you looked at one angle and a reptile face when the angle was changed. What I saw, in effect , was a shape-shift. The Matrix is an enormous library of waveform images wa iting for DNA/RNA to manifest them as holograms. I remember being contacted by the neighbour of a ma n who worked as a gardener at one of the Brit ish Royal Family estates at Sandringham, in Norfolk. The man had been describing very bizarre experiences there. Through the neighbour, I arranged to meet him, but then he was apparently warn ed not to speak with me. However, one of the experiences he had re counted to the neigh bour was about part of the estate where he had s een two completely different scenes at the same location. If you looked from one angle (his words), it was a small wood and if you looked from another it was a Swedish-styl e pine cottage! It is we , through our DNA/RNA, who change the scenery we e xperience by, to maintain th e movie analogy, selecting different 'sets' or locations in the program. It is not the scenery that is changing, but rather our DNA/RNA that makes the scenery appear to change as it decodes the wave patterns. Strike them at one point a nd you are in the 'future', strike them at another and you are in the 'past', or the 'pre sent'. But where is the past, present and future on a software program or movie? Th ere is no past or fu ture - everything is happening NOW. This is how psychic people are able to 'see' what we call the future. Their DNA/RNA network has the ability to pick out the freque ncy patterns 'later' in the movie. It is the same wi th those who have vi sions of the past. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Figure 50: 'Past', 'present' and 'future' on DVD. All are happening at the same 'time' in different parts of the same 'disk' and what happens in one 'scene' can affect a ll the rest. Thus, the 'past' can change the 'future' and the 'future' can change the 'past' I have read and been told of many experiences where pe ople have seen something, like a building, and yet when they return, even hours or sometimes minutes later, it has disappeared. I remember one story about people who saw an old-style American house on fire as they drove pa st and they immediately went to call for help. It was standing by itself back from the road and was clearly visible lik e any other building. But when they returned there was no house and no sign of where one had been. They had somehow accessed a different part of the program. As we change our DNA/RNA focus from one wave pattern to anot her, the patterns we have ceased to manifest still exist for other DNA (peopl e and all living things) to experience. As I was writing this I had a clear pict ure of a DVD with scenes from 'history' lined up along the su rface as the laser moved across to manifest the various events in turn. And the laser was RNA reading the program. You can see Neil Hague's portrayal of the image in Figure 50. This sy mbolises how, as we strike or observe different patterns in the program and 'mov e' into the 'future', there is other consciousness 'following' us in the progr am and still more 'ahe ad' of us. As we change scenes, so others are accessing the scenes we left behind.

What I am saying, therefor e, is the 'p ast' has not ceased to be, and nor is the future yet to be. Both are being played out Now by those in other parts of the program. We see Stonehenge, for example, as an ancient ruin from the past because that is where we are in the Matrix/Time Loop program/movie. But, at another point, people are 'living' at the original Stonehenge, and at another it is not even built yet! In one part of the program the American War of Independence may be just starting and at another the Second World War is still going on. I know it sounds impossible th at the same battle is cons tantly being fought, but think about it. When you have a battle in a movie on DVD or the Internet , the start, middle, and end of the fighting always exists on the disk or software. It is the same with the Matrix. When you spin back a movie and press 'play', has anything changed since you last watched it? No, an d, once again, it is the same with the Matrix unless the script is rewritten by either the Matrix or consciousness making decisions at odds with the software. The latter is why those Matrix clones, the Illuminati, are so freaked ou t by mavericks that refuse to conform to the program. In doing so, they are rewr iting it. Consciou sness can do this by overriding the program through the DNA. If we don't, then , as they say, history keeps repeating. The Stone Age, Iron Age, Industrial Re volution and computer- dominated world of 'today' are happening over a nd over. To experience them you need to be at that point in the program, that's all. We are not going anywhere, not evolving, we are experiencing part of a program designed to enslave us and turn us into generators of fear - the energy th at powers the Matrix. Think of horses on a carousel. Whether anyone is sitting on them or not they still go round with the rest. Our 'physical' bodi es are biological computers reading software programs and they are running all the time. The question is whether self- aware consciousness chooses to experience this illusory world th rough one of those software carousel 'horses' (human bodies) or not. If it doesn't, the 'body' will still play out the program, because it is a bi ological computer capable of 'thought' (assessment of data). Bu t it will be nothing more than software without consciousness as defined in this book. Everything you see in the Matrix is part of the program, including your own body. The exception to this is your consciousness, those that have any that is, because, in th e way I am defining consciousness in this book, not everyone has. The phenomenon of the 'woman in the red dress' in the first Matrix movie, the wo man who was just part of a software program despite appearing 'real', is not confined to a Hollywood sci-fi script. These 'computer' creations, these carousel hor ses with no rider, are everywhere. There are three main groups of 'people' in the Matrix (see Figure 51): 1) First there are the software prog rams whose only cons ciousness is the DNA/RNA receiving inst ructions from the Matrix.

For this reason they perceive life and the world very differently to the rest and can be seen as 'crazy' or 'dangerous' 79 "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"80 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion expressions of this are at the same level of awareness. The 'human' interactive software programs are sophisticated robots following a 'life' program dictated by the Matrix and their free will is basi cally zilch. I'm sure you must have met many. They appear to be the same as everyone else in the way they look, but the best special effects studios can now put digital 'people' into advertisements and you can't see the join. There is a televisi on presenter in Britain who is famous for being enormous and she appeared in a commercial with a far slimmer body to sell a food product. You could not see the join and anyone who didn't know what she really looked like would believe the body in the ad was hers. This is why we have to be extremely wary about 'Bin Laden' videos that suddenly come to light at just the right time from the agenda's point of view. Producing a fake Bin Laden saying fake words is a cinch to the state-of-the-art special effects houses. The same principle applies with these 'Red Dress' programs, as I will call them. They are bodies without consci ousness, interactive software programs. The lifeless look in their eyes is one way of picking them out, as is the lack of energy coming from them. They resonate to a different frequency to conscious awareness and again you can symbolise them as the horses on the carousel with no one on board. These interactive software programs can malfunction, go off message, and 'hack' into other programs - as with the Agent Smith character in the Matrix movies. A lot of that is going on, too. 2) Other people do have consciousness, but are so entranced and deluded by the Matrix that their DNA programming calls the shots and dictates the path that they take. These horses do have a rider, but the horse is still making the decisions. They go where the DNA program takes them because they don't think they have a choice or don't choose to make one. They can be lovely, caring people and express their consciousness in that way, but they can't see beyond the illusion. These are the main energy source for the Matrix because it feeds off the emotional energies of fear, guilt, and fru stration etc., generated by consciousness trapped in this virtual reality pris on and identifying with its programmed 'personality'. Once consciousness identifies with the mind and emotions - the software - it begins to resonate to those frequencies and this invariably means an expression of fear. These people, with what you might call 'back seat consciousness', also represent by far the bi ggest section of 'conscious' humanity. They are the system fodder who overwhelmingly do and think as they are told. 3) The third, and by far the smallest, group are those who are aware enough to see through the illusion and have begun to access the knowing of Infinite Oneness beyond the walls of the software program. This doesn't mean they understand the full nature of life and reality, but they have at least a subconscious knowing that the world is not as it seems. They are the only ones with free will in the sense that they have the awareness and power of consciousness to break the control of the DNA software. They can ri de the horse and, in doing so, rewrite the program. These people stand out from the crowd and are dubbed dangerous"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"81 or mad because they don't se e the world like everyone el se. The Matrix is a six- stone weakling compared with consciousness in its true power, and this group is like a computer virus that has the means to scramble the pr ogram and download another reality. The Matrix targets these people with a vengeance to protect its control and also because if it can manipulate this level of consciousness to become caught in the illus ions and succumb to fear, it is a massive potential energy source. Consciousness has become trapped by the Ma trix in a maze of smoke and mirrors that has implanted a false reality. The 'R ed Dresses', or software people, are no problem because they just follow the codes. The targets of the Matrix are those with self-aware consciousness who find themselv es, for whatever reason, caught in the flytrap. It is in pursuit of these people - this consciousness - that the system of society is so designed in this part of the program. I have been saying in my books for years that the system has been structured to ho ld consciousness in a prison of the five senses. You can see everywhere that this is so obviously true. But what is this five- sense jail cell? It is a pr ison of the brain and body - the DNA! While we are focused purely on the five-sense reality we are sl aves to the DNA that dictates our thoughts, emotions and actions. The consciousness of mo st people never gets its hands on the wheel of life because the DNA will not vacat e the driver's seat. Consciousness in its reconnected infinite power could easily take c ontrol, but it is difficult to do this when you are not aware that you are Infinite Consciousn ess and you think that the DNA thoughts and emotions you are having are you rs. This is how the movie constantly plays out while slumbering conscious ness thinks it is calling the shots! The aim is to turn conscious beings into generators of fear in all its forms to empower the Matrix, and to take away freedom and replace it with what I call feardom - domination by fear. One of the major ways this is done is through the software programs that we call 'leaders'. You will recall the em phasis I have placed on the obsession of the Illuminati families with interbreeding and genetics. As I have already suggested, what we call proc reation is the recording of two software programs (father and mother) onto one di sk - the child. All bodies are software programs and the diffe rence is whether they are pure software (Red Dresses) or whether consciousness is in volved. When cons ciousness expresses itself through the body it rewrites the DNA programming wh ich, in turn, is tr ansmitted to other DNA and to the Matrix in ge neral. These people change what we call the bloodline and, as a result, these Red Dre ss genetic lines become increa singly less controlled by the dictates of the program. Such people wi ll have a heart dime nsion to their views and decisions; they will have a sense of empathy, compassion and fairness. They will not, in short, react as a programmed disk in the wa y the Matrix demands with violence, bigotry and an absence of empathy with those who suffer the consequences of their actions. The world is awash with this mentality because it is awash with software people. The leading Red Dress bloodlines are the Il luminati families. At the level we are discussing now, the reason they are so obsessed with interbreeding and avoiding"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"82 outside genetic input is to ensure that thei r replicated programs ('offspring') remain pure software and are not rewritten by the infusion of consciousness. Since the ancient world (as we percei ve it anyway), they have bred (copied the disks) overwhelmingly with each other. The royal families that ruled ancient societies were mostly Red Dress soft ware programs and they ma intain this power today through Illuminati families li ke the Rothschilds, Rockef ellers, Windsors and those I name in my other books (Figure 52). The Bu sh family is the same, but then you only have to see George 'Dubya' to know that. Obviously he was a duff download. The Illuminati Red Dresses are there to dictat e and control conscious beings so they remain caught in the illusion and produce th e desired fear to fu el the system. By placing themselves at the t op of the political, banking, business, media and military system these bloodlines can eas ily do that, so long as most conscious people remain puppets to their DNA. The Matrix has its software in positio ns of power across the world and uses these programs to cause the wars that cons cious people, or lowe r level Red Dresses, are told to fight. The wars generate enormous amounts of fear and the Matrix sucks it in. Interestin gly, the Matrix movies featured a character, a software program, called the Merovingian. One of the purest Illuminati bloodlines (programs) is known by the same name because of its connection to the Me rovingian kings in what is now France, leadi ng up to the period of Char lemagne. The Merovingian character in the movies was French and controlled the Train Man who policed the in-between realm that was remarkably similar in co ncept to the interspaces. Talking of which, I have c onnected a reptilian 'species ' very strongly to the Illuminati and I can now se e more clearly how this fi ts in. I remember Credo Mutwa, the Zulu Sanusi, telling me once that 'to understand the Illuminati you must study the reptile'. How right he was and even more so in the light of what is emerging. I did indeed study the reptile an d it is as near to a computer program that you could find. Of course there are variations but, basically, they are creatures controlled by instinct (programming) and they will react in an incredibly predictable way to a ny situation. I have wa tched a few demonstrat ions at crocodile farms in Australia where the keeper told the audience how the croc would react to something he was goin g to do and every time, with out exception, that is what happened. The Illumina ti, too, are nothing if not predictable in their techniques and reactions, and the character traits of th e reptilian brain within the human brain mirror those of the reptilians and Illu minati - cold-blooded attitudes with no empathy for their victims, a de sire for top-down structures of control, territorialism (this is mine keep out) a nd obsessive ritualistic beha viour. This describes the Illuminati exactly because they are reptilian software . You will find no better example of reptilian behavi our than the Britis h Royal Family, wh ich is obsessed with ritual and protocol. The Illuminati 'human' bodies are only hol ographic veils that hide their true nature. They allow them to operate u ndetected within the realm of visible electromagnetic light.

They could either op erate as a reptilian hologram, or hide behind an apparently 'human' one, just as the sentient programs morph in and out of different human forms in the Matrix trilogy. Either way, the Rep tilians and other projected agents of the Matrix were not 'real' in consciou sness terms. They were like projections, holographic thought fields or, as the voice put it, highly sophisticated software programs. 'If you programmed a co mputer to kill children, would that computer have any emotiona l problems with that ?' the voice asked. The answer is obvious; it would follo w the program because it does not have a consciousness to intervene in the decision. It was the same with the I lluminati Reptilia ns, the voice said. They were like digita l people implanted in the movies alongside human actors. They appeared to be the same, but they were not and th eir power of thought was limited to data processing with in the confines of their software. The Reptilian program would seem to be a fou ndation code of th e Matrix and it is not surprising that even the magnified DNA has that look about it. The very fact that the body is a hologram with a rep tilian brain means that throughout the super- hologram, or Matrix, the rep tilian dimension must be repeated because every part of a hologram contains a sm aller version of th e whole. The Reptilians immediately behind the Illuminati are one example of that. When you look at the response characteristics of the reptilian brain in 'humans', it is about instinctive (programmed) emotional reactions and no t consciousness or love. The voice in Brazil said the Illuminati Re ptilians did not know they were tools of the Matrix - computer programs designed to manipulat e the sub-plots in the movie that generate the fear that powers the system, although they did have an understanding of how the Matrix works. The Reptilians f eed off fear, but on behalf of the Matrix that wrote their program. They think they are masters when in truth they are slaves to their creator. I also stress that that th ere are Reptilians not involved in the manipulation and, even with regard to those who are, I am not presenting this information from the perspective of 'us' and 'the m'. Everything is the same Oneness, whether it is the energy/mind of a software program or Onenes s in awareness of itself. The Matrix is controlled by our own fear and the Reptilia ns, Illuminati and ot her 'enemies', are this fear made manifest. Th ey are us and we are them. When we free ourselves from fear, they will cease to take illusory form because the s ource of their projection will have been switched off. The holographic nature of reality explai ns how the Illumina ti Reptilians, and others, can shape-shift. I understand how people find it impossible to comprehend how something can instantly swap its body, including heart, lungs, brain and so on, for another. But this is not what is happ ening because that's all holographic illusion. If people think physical with this they will never get it. Sh ape-shifting is the movement from one illuso ry holographic projection ('human') to another ('reptilian'). It is all happen ing as an illusion in the brai n because that's where this whole reality is located. Scie ntists say this ' physical' world is made up of atoms and subatomic particles such as electrons, an d this is how author and researcher Michael Talbot describes their prope rties in the Holographic Universe: "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"85 'The electron, like some shape-shifter out of fo lklore, can manifest as either a particle or a wave ... This chameleon-like ability is common to all subatomic particles. It is also common to all things once thought to mani fest exclusively as waves. Light, gamma rays, radio waves, X-rays - all can change fr om waves and back again. Today physicists believe that subatomic phenomena should not be classified solely as either waves or particles, but as a single category of somethings that are always somehow both. These somethings are called quanta, and physicists believe they are the basic stuff from which the entire universe is made.' Talbot adds that the 'capacity to shape-sh ift from one kind of particle to another is just another of a quantum's abilities', and he says of 'ext raterrestrial' entities: if we are being visited by be ings who are as ins ubstantial and plasti c in form ... it is not at all surprising that they might appear in a ch ameleon-like multitude of shapes'. We are dealing with a virtual-rea lity game here and so anything is possible. Shape-shifting is small deal once you real ise what is happening, but people find it hard to comprehend beca use they believe the world to have solidity. I would stress, by the way, that the Rep tilians and othe r Red Dress people are not confined to the major Illuminati families. You find them throughout society at all levels and especially at the extremes and polarities because the Matrix needs polarities to function (Figure 53, overleaf). It is the realm of vibration and for something to vibrate (as all does within the Matrix) it has to have two points or polarities between which to oscillate. Everywhere yo u see the system seeking polarisation. The Red Dresses are programme d to create this and draw slumbering conscious beings into the manufactured co nflicts and divisions. Listen to the mainstream software talk-s how hosts on American radi o or look at many of the software soldiers and John Wayne sound-a-likes during th e invasion of Iraq. I heard one soldier say on BBC televi sion: 'We bomb 'em, you know? It's cool to me because I like explosions and stuff like that but, li ke, I don't get to see the actual explosion, and that's what I want to see but, I guess when we get closer to Baghdad we'll get to see more of that.' Definitely earl y Microsoft, maybe Windows 95, or perhaps that's optimistic. The uniform doesn't ma tter and nor does the race or the 'cause' they claim to be fighting fo r. Whether it is American tr oops killing civ ilians in Iraq, Israeli troops murdering Palestinians in Gaza or fanatics bomb ing restaurants or buses in Jerusalem, they are versions of the same software program. Not all soldiers are like that, some are consciousness caug ht in the game, but most are clone-like programs and you will find the same throughout the system. From this perspective we are able to s ee a deeper reason behind the Illuminati obsession with mind control. I have writt en about this in detail in other books because it is such a fundamental part of the Illuminati modus operandi. They use millions of children abducte d into the mind-control projec ts or handed over by their sick or mind-controlled parents. The chil dren have their brains rewired and their minds turned into a honeycomb of self-c ontained compartments known as Alters. What they call the 'front alte r' is the one that interacts with the world most of the time, and people who know th em think this is them. These alters are implanted "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" Figure 53: Pure software programs are not confined to the Illuminati families. You find them at all levels of society and they are often the clone-like gofers that serve the system without question. Self-aware consciousness can also behave the same wa y when it is deeply caught in the illusion with specific tasks, together with tri gger words and other codes to activate the programming - everything from an assassi nation or being sexually abused as a child, or adult, by a famo us Illuminati name that th ey don't remember once the experiencing alter, or compartment, is switched to another. What the Red Dress families behind these projec ts are doing is seeking to take conscious beings and reduce them to that of software. They want conscious people fo r this because they have more potential abilities and gifts to be exploited than the mo st advanced of the software variety. For example, the major Illuminati human sacrifice rituals are often conducted by a conscious bein g in a mind-controlled stat e. The top mind-controllers also know that the human body/brain is a holographic computer system and they exploit this understanding to download programs onto their victims' DNA and manipulate the RNA to read them. What we call the trigger words, sounds or images that activate the programming are like pressing 'enter'. Victims of Illuminati mind control have described how they could be drugged or drunk in one compartment, but immediately clean an d sober when they were switched to another. This is perfectly explainable when you realise that they were being switched between software. 86"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"87 When I say it's all an illusion and a comp uter program, I do mean all. It is an apparent contradiction that the earth and the cosmos was suppos ed to have been created by a loving God and yet what we call Nature is a bloody battle-ground in which one animal's survival is dependent on another's, often grotesque, demise. The voice in Brazil told me that there was no contradiction in this because the law of the wild' was not the creation of a lovi ng God or Oneness in awareness of itself. It was a Matrix software program and, without the control of fear, the relationship between animals, and animals and humans , would be very different. Did you ever sing that song at school called All Things Bright and Beautiful! It tells us how wonderful God is fo r making the world: All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful, The Lord God made them all. Each little flower that opens, Each little bird that sings, He made their glowing petals, He made their tiny wings. Well, it sounds like a good CV, but let's read the small prin t here. There is another way of l ooking at this: All things shite and horrible, All killers great and small, All things pulled apart alive, The Lord God made them all. Each great big shark that eats you, Each little snake that stings, He made the lethal venom, He made the torn off wings. The voice in Brazil asked: 'Do you think the Infinite, where you are now, would wish to see anything suffer and live in fear, never mind create a structure in which this happened as a matter of course?' Nature was another holographic projection that was only 'real' because we were conditioned to believe it was (Figure 54, overleaf). The voice said the 'l aws' of the natural world refl ected the state of being of their creator, the force controlling the Matrix. This was a state of fear and desperation to survive ... a trait of the reptilian brain. (Observe human society and you'll see how it is structured in the same way with people surviving or prospering at the expense of others - 'dog eat dog' and all that.) There were, the voice said, some apparently beau tiful expressions of nature on 'P lanet Earth' and so long as we "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Figure 54: Animals, the Natural World and the 'law of the wild' are all holographic illusions projected through DNA software 88"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"realised they were illusion s they could be enjoyed. But we should be careful not to become mesmerised by what we see on ea rth or we would become like a moth hypnotised by a light, trapped by illusions th at held us in a disc onnected state. The Matrix can be extremely captiv ating - just look at a clea r night sky, or a panoramic landscape. The message was to enjoy what you see, bu t remember th at what you 'see' is merely what you think you see or are manipulated to see (Figure 55 and 56). If you observe Nature fr om this perspective you can see the program very clearly. A few months before I started this book I wa s watching a series on BBC television called Massive Nature. It featur ed animals and fish that only survived by reproducing in fantastic numb ers because of all the pred ators they faced. If they didn't do this their species would die out and so would others who depended on eating them for their own survival. This is a classic Matrix program with one creature surviving, or prospering, at the expense of another (again, see the 'human' world). Each show in the Massive Nature se ries followed the same basic story in that the 'massive' species would make a jour ney every year that would take them through the very location wher e their predators lay in wait. One involved the Wildebeest, which is dinner for so many species in Africa, including the croc odiles featured in the BBC show. Every year the wildebeest went on a journey for their own survival in sear ch of the grass they needed and it took them across a river where the crocodiles would wait, knowing they were coming. Some call this 'instinct' and I say that wh at we term 'instinct' is the software program activated through th eir DNA. When the wildebeest tried to cross the river there was carnage as the crocodiles a ttacked, and similar scenes are being constantly reproduced by other species of animals, birds and insects across the planet. Ain't Nature great? The program is written to include the circumstances in which the 'massive' species is spawned every year and then has to travel from a 89"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"90 safe area to where the predat ors are waiting to take adva ntage. The laws of nature, and how animals have incredible abilities or colourings to meet their particular needs or environment, are computer program s, and this is what we call evolution. Sorry, Mr Darwin, evolution is the cycle of th e program and survival or extinction depends on the keyboard operator, be it the fear-controlled Matrix or consciousness. Another documentary I saw told the story of Grey Whales which, once again, spent part of the year in warm waters wh ere they were safe, but had little food, and then headed north where th ere was food, but they were n't safe. Or at least the calves weren't. The progra mme showed how Killer Whales pursued a Grey Whale calf for six hours as its mother, who was t oo big and powerful to be attacked, tried to provide protection. The killers sought to separate calf from mother and hold it under the water to drown. The mother fought desperately to save her offspring and help it to breathe but, in the end, exhaustio n took over and the Killer Whales lived up to their name. Even after all those hours of pursuit and all that fear and trauma, they only ate the calf's tongue and lower jaw and the rest was le ft to the scavengers on the ocean floor. It was just another bloody crime-scene in the wonderful world of Nature. What kind of 'intelligence' creates a natural world in which the survival of one depends on tearing another to pieces? What sick mind wo uld design a global life-cycle in which the partic ipants were in a mode of constant fear - humans as well as the animals? Would a loving Go d do that? No, but th e mind behind the Matrix would, and it has. Funnily enough, a few weeks after I sa w the wildebeest documentary I was watching another about the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland, wh en the Illuminati frontman William of Orange (Protestant) wa s fighting for the British throne against James II (Catholic) in 1690. It led to the Pr otestant-Catholic conflic ts in Ireland right up to modern times (this point in the progr am, in other words). At one stage in the computer-generated reconstr uction of the battle, William's fodder troops began to pour across a shallow part of the River Bo yne while army of James pounded them with a hail of gunfire from the other side . What I was watching was a mirror of the wildebeest trying to cross the river under attack from the crocodiles. How appropriate because both are part of the same comput er program - the Matrix. What is the difference betw een a lion or croc devouring a wildebeest, tearing its flesh from its body, and a child being bl own to pieces by a Br itish or American bomb during the invasion of Iraq? They ar e products of the sa me mentality behind the program. All bodies are DNA software a nd it is the same with anim als. Some will have a form of consciousness and others will no t. Most animal species operate on a much more collective level of r eality - more of a hive mind - and the Illuminati are seeking, through the reptilian brain, to take humanity fu rther down this same road. As we can see, they have succeeded on an enormous scale. The more consciousness inhabits the software of th e animal species the more it rewrites the DNA. Also, the more the animal software comes into cont act with human self-aware consciousness, the more the same will happen because of the vibrational communication between "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Mat Future on DVD 91 them. A domesticated animal will have its instincts (DNA pr ogramming) rewritten by contact with self-aware consciousness, and the communication that takes place between the animal and human DNA via the codes common to both. A domesticated dog and a wild dog may look basically the same, but their behaviour traits and attitudes can be very differen t because domestication has changed the DNA program. Whales and dolp hins would also appear to be examples of species that express consciousness at a far higher level than most others. Trees, flowers, plants and landscapes are software, too. I k now this is highly controversial, but so what? No one has to believe it. I have always loved the Natural World - animals, forests, seascapes and rolling countryside. I still enjoy these scenes, even from my emerging perspective, but I see them in a different light. Inst ead of looking at something that is 'real', I see them as lik e beautiful holographic paintings that can be enjoyed, but no t allowed to del ude my reality of what they are. It's all an illusion, even breathing and eating. We only have to do this because our DNA tells us that we do and we believe it. Remember that scene in the first Matrix movie when the Neo and Morpheus characters are fighting in a kung fu software program? Morpheus says to a heavy-breathing Neo: 'Do you think that's air you're breathing now, in this place?' Of course it couldn't ha ve been because his mind was in the kung fu prog ram, not his body. But he still breathed because his mind was programmed to do so. Does pure ener gy, pure consciou sness, have to breathe with lungs? So why do we when we are pure consci ousness, too? Only because we believe we do and let us not fo rget that the world in which we 'need to breathe' is all happening in our brain. Ther e is no 'out there' where the laws of breathing apply. It is the same with eati ng. Does energy, cons ciousness, sit down to lunch or order a pizza? No , the DNA programming does that. The need for food, warmth and shelter is writte n into the Matrix program because it controls through dependency and the need to survive. If you didn't need food, warmth or shelter to survive look at how the control of th e system would dissolve from your life. I am not saying we can just stop breathing and eating at th e point when we intellectually see the nonsense of it. If we don't ov erride the DNA programming our body will 'die' because its software says, 'If I don't eat or breathe I will die'. It has to be done at the deepest of levels so th at this part of the program - 1 have to eat and breathe - is deleted. It is for this reason that I am not about to hold my breath or cancel the dinner reservation. But it is all illusion. Even what th e food tastes like is a program. It is the Matrix that decide s how an egg or banana tastes because what we call taste is just an electrical sign al from the tongue to the brain (DNA central processing unit) which interprets the 'taste' in lin e with the programming. Different programs decode these signals in different ways - 'I love eggs', 'bananas are yuck'. As the voice in Brazil said: 'Do you think the Infinite sits down to dinner? Do you think the Infinite has to breathe or it will die? So why do those in the Time L oop? Answer: because they identify who they are and their sense of possibility with being a physical \"personality\" subordinate to illusory \"laws\" and not with being what they really are - the Infinite One.'"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"92 There have been people who have stopped eating without ill effects, as I explain in Tales from the Time Loop, because they are able to absorb nourishment directly from light/energy without going through the 'middle men' of plants and animals. The need to eat is, literally, all in the head, as is the 'warmth' of the sun on which life appears so dependent. 'Do you think the Infinite needs the sun to survive?' the voice asked. 'You are the Infinite so why do you need the sun to sustain you?' Certainly no sun was required in that state of bliss and wonde r that I experienced in the ayahuasca session. The voice said that we felt heat from the sun simply because that is what the Matrix programmed the body to feel. The sun and moon were holograms to provide the illusion of night and day - the movement of 'time'. As Genesis puts it: 'And God said, Let there be light: and th ere was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night'. Or, put another way: 'And God said, Let there be light: and he tapped on the keyboard, pressed 'enter', and there was light'. I was told that what we call the Universe is a hol ographic illusion similar to looking up at the 'sky' projected on the ceiling of a planetar ium (Figure 57). The only difference was that in the 'universe' th e projections appeared to be 3D because they were holograms. When you look at the illusory ni ght sky in a planetarium it can look incredibly 'real'. But what is it? A computer program! The 'universe' was a figment of our conditioned imagination, the voice said, and it wa s only part of our reality because we believed it was. The universe was al so far smaller than people perceived even within our illusion of sp ace and distance. 'Loo k at the sky in a planetarium and it seems so vast, yet it onl y goes as high as the ceiling.' At one point in the Brazilian experi ence, the voice said: 'Do yo u think that's the earth you're lying on now? Mmmm ... I lluuusion!' As with everyt hing in the Time Loop and throughout the Matrix, the 'physical' earth was a holographic projection. 'You are lying on the earth now only because you think you are', the voice said.

'Remember always', said the voice, 'Infinite Love is the only truth, everything else is illusion - everything.' This includes 'space' as well as 'time'. Scientists talk about the space/time continuum, but space and time do not exis t. When a hologram is projected by a laser from the photographic interference pattern it app ears to be 3D and occupying 'space'. But it isn't, it just seems that wa y. Everything is Infinite Consciousness, so everything is everything else. Therefore, a pinhead is infinity because everything is infinity. Size is an illu sion, as men have been sa ying all along. Where does the droplet of water end and the ocean begin? They don't; they are One. Infinity has no beginning and no end. The dropl et ('pinhead') is the ocean. Scientists can't understa nd why subatomic pa rticles can communi cate instantly with each other over staggering distance s because they are thinking in terms of space. But there is no space in volved. It is like the droplet of water and the ocean. There are no particles, plural, except in th e way we perceive them in the illusion. All particles are the same One. They don't have to communi cate between each other because there is no 'each other' and they don't move from one place to another because there is no space and so there can be no places. A ppropriately the word 'Utopia' means 'no place' - beyond th e illusion of time an d space. The super- hologram appears to o ccupy space and we talk of the vastness of space. But it's a hologram and so that cannot be. If there is no space how come we seem to travel through it? Once again beca use that is the illusion ou r DNA/RNA decodes for us and we travel through space only as electr ical signals interpre ted by the brain. The voice in Brazil said: 'Why do you need to fly around in aircra ft? You are point A and you are point B an d you are everything in betwee n. Why then do you need to use an aircraft to fly through yourself?' William Blake describe d this magnificently when he wrote: To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour. This can also be related to the hologram b ecause a grain of sand and a wild flower are smaller versions of the whole. In the same way, the inside of an atom is similar to a solar syst em, and the human body, itself made up of cells, is like a cell of the super-hologram. There is another important point to ma ke about this Matrix software/illusion thing. What is 'history'? OK, we might say th at it is the earlier scenes in the movie leading up to where we are. Yes, it could be, but there are other ways to look at it. We think we know what hist ory is because of archaeol ogical finds and accounts 'passed down' through the 'ages' or other parts of the program, as I would put it. But have they been? I am not saying they have or haven't, I'm just exploring other possibilities in the light of a greater understanding of th e illusion we are experiencing as 'life'.

When the Matrix or consciousness changes the program at any point, it could, and probably does, reassemble the entire DVD movie/Time Loop in what we call the 'past' or 'future'. You see the theme in some movies of pe ople going back in 'time' to change the sequence of events that led to some problem in their 'present'. As I add in sentences amid the already written text on this computer, what goes before and after reassembles itself to accommodate the new information. Why can't this be happening with 'history'? When consciousness or the Matrix changes another part of the program (the 'past'), the scenes that follow ('the future') reassemble themselves in a new way. It is like dominoes fa lling when the first one is pushed. In other words, our 'history' is constan tly being rewritten. But let's go further. Say there was no Stone Age and that all the archaeological 'finds', relics, monoliths and 'evidence' is merely written into the program at this point (Figure 58). The DNA is constantly receiving information from the Matrix, so 'history' at any stage is onl y what the Matrix ch ooses to communicate to the DNA and the RNA decides to read . Did 'yesterday' really exist as you thought it did or is it just a signal your DNA is rece iving now? But I have 'memory', you might say. 'I remember yesterday.' Mayb e that's true, but here's a question. How can you have a memory when there is no time? Memory is a recollection from the past, but there is no past, only Now. Wh at we think we see at any point are only electrical signals decoded by the brain. The signals + interpretation of the signals = reality. One other point is worth introducing here .

Each interpretation creates a diff erent illusory 'universe'. They may look like the same one with planets and stars, roads and cars, but they are not th e same. My universe, for example, is, to put it mildly, not the one perceived in the head of George W. Bush. Each of these interpretations creates what scientists call a parallel universe, so imagine how many there must be. They are actually parallel imaginations, parallel perceptions or realities, held together by the Matrix 'b rain'. There are also other Matrix programs that would be perceived as parallel universes and other dimensions of reality. As astrophysicist and writer, Gi uliana Conforto, said in Organic Universe: 'We are not only \"inside\" one visible matrix, but also in more than one, maybe in all of them. We might participate in other movies, too, each with its own event horizon or peculiar frequencies. Matrices are like TV channels.' A 2002 edition of the BBC science series, Horizon, was devoted to the gathering acceptance of parallel univer ses. The opening narrativ e to the programme said: 'For almost a hundred years science has been haunted by a dark secret, that there might be mysterious, hidden worlds beyond our human senses. Mystics have long claimed there were such places. They were, they said, full of ghosts and spirits - but ever since the 19th century physicists have been trying to make sense of an uncomfortable discovery. When they tried to pinpoint the exact location of atomic particles like electrons, they found it was utterly impossible. They had no single location. The only explanation that anyone coul d come up with is that the particles don't just exist in our universe. They slip into ex istence in other universes, too, and there are an infinite number of these parallel universes, all of them slightly different. In effect, there's a parallel universe in which Napoleon won the Battle of Waterloo; in another the British Empire held on to its American colonies; in one you were never born. They are even stranger than Elvis being alive.' What the narrative is describing are other holographic illusory realities within the super-hologram I call the Ma trix. Thought creates; emot ion creates; the Matrix creates; consciousness crea tes; and this all is happening within Infinite Consciousness, the Infinite One. No wonder scientists are bemused and dumbfounded when they try to understand the nature of reality.

It becomes a pleasure Oscar Wilde he human body and its health, or otherw ise, can be seen from a massively different perspective when you realise that reality is illusory and what appears to be solid is a hologram that only gives th e appearance of 3D. 'E mpty' atoms do not a solid wall make and it 's the same with the 'body'. It is a frequency field decoded into a hologram by other frequency fiel ds called DNA and RNA. This explains so many apparent mysterie s, not least in the realm of so-called alternative or complimentary healing. Ho w can reflexology and acupuncture find points throughout the body that relate to all the organs and other functions? How can you massage, or insert a ne edle at a point on the foot, hand or ear and affect the liver, stomach or heart? It seems crazy if you accept the o fficial explanations of the human form, but it makes perfect sense wh en you know the body is a hologram. Remember that one of the am azing properties of holograms is that every part is a smaller version of the whol e. Far from being a mystery that the whol e body can be found in the foot, hand or ear, it is the way it must be if the body is a hologram. An entire body can be grow n from a single cell because ev ery cell is a smaller version of the whole and contains all the in formation contained in the whole. On another level, the body is like a smaller (to our rea lity) version of the earth, the solar system and universe. They, too, are computer programs, operating with or without consciousness, and smaller e xpressions of the super-hologram that I call the Matrix. So the human brain must be a version of the Matrix 'brain', or central processing unit. Palm reading is based on this same principle because the hand is a smaller version of the body, but it goes further. Every part of the hand, foot and ear also contains the whole and so does every part of the finger and every part of every part of the finger down to every cell, atom and electron. And all these are holographic projections from a frequency field or interference pattern. This means that we affect the super-hologram with everything we believe, think or do in the same way that a reflexologist can affect the whole body through its 'parts'. This is how love can influence the reality of the Matrix and replace the dominance of fear. 96 T"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"97 In the summer of 2004,1 experienced these pr inciples myself when I went to speak in Hawaii. Well, someon e's got to do it, eh? For several w eeks before the tr ip my health had been poor. I had severe pain in my spin e, especially my neck, and within days of arriving it was excruciating. Anything I di d was agony. Even lying down or driving over a little bump in the road made me feel like screaming. Fortunately, I went out to Hawaii three weeks before the talk and it gave me time to seek help. Funnily enough, I had been saying for many months that I felt I would have some si gnificant healing in Hawaii and that's how, thank goodness, it tu rned out. I was staying on the island of Maui when I woke up one morning with this overwhelming feeling that I had to go to Big Island, a short flight away. A few minu tes later, Pam came in from checking e- mails to say that some friends had invited us to use their house on Big Island while we were in Hawaii. It was the first of many synchronicities that led me to be healed. The day after we arrived at the house my neck and spine worsened rapidly and I went to see a chiropractor, desperately seeking relief. He wa s a guy who was far more enlightened than conventional chiropractors and manipulating the spine was only part of his philosophy. Within a few minutes of our first meeting he also suggested that I have a colon cleanse in which a pipe is stuck up your bum to literally wash out the crap. He said it was a pity becaus e a colon cleanse programme had started a few miles away and I had just missed it. In fact, when we rang the people involved, there had been two cancellations, allowing Pam and I to take part a day behind all the others. With both th e colon cleanse and the chiropractor, the key to my healing was the holographic natu re of the body. Most colon cleanses are like wham-bam -thank-you-ma'am, or man. Whack it in, turn it on, whoosh, slosh, yuck , thanks for calling. The be st ones do it gently over several days, in my case eleven, and clea n away the accumulate d debris from ever rurther inside the colon. I am no expert on what came out to play , but I can say with certainty that it was better out than in. I'll spare you th e details, much as I know how interested you must be. One common problem to ment ion, though, is a sort of mucus that lines the sides of the colon and stops the body abso rbing the goodness in the food. You can eat all the good food you like in that stat e, but the body sees very little of it in nutrients. On the wall be side me, as the peac eful waters flowed, was a chart with the colon laid out in sect ions, each relating to different organs and parts of the body - the hologram (Figure 59, overleaf). With ever y daily session of around two hours, the water goes deeper to clean out more and more of these sections. My general health began to improve in the firs t few days and my neck and spine improved dramatically when the clea nse reached the area that related to this part of the body. By the end of the elev en days my health ha d not been better for years and my neck and spine were virtually pain free. At the same time I was seeing the chiropractor. He couldn't touch me to start with, such was the pain, and he said it was one of the worst cases he'd seen. But as the colon cleanse did its work he was able to make his contributio n to freeing the neck and spine. In his treatment room was another chart, this time with the spine marked out in sections, each relating to an organ or part of the body (Figure 60, overleaf). Wherever you look you see the hologram, including the eyes (Figure 61, overleaf). "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"98 "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"99 everything reflec ts everything else, the different organs specialise in certain things. For example, the whole body is a DNA computer system receiving and transmitting information, but the brain is the central processing unit that specialises in communication traffic. The liver is the toxin-removal specialist and th at includes an emotional toxin - anger. The gall bladder, which is part of the liver, produces fluid called bile and when we are describing someone venting anger we talk of them being full of bile. Our everyday phrases describe many literal an d symbolic truths without us realising. The liver dumps its toxins into the colon to be discharged, but when the colon is blocked, or if the b ody is massively toxi c, there is more po ison than can be processed. The liver deals with this by prod ucing little 'stones' made from hardened bile or minerals to block blood vessels and stop the toxins re-entering the bloodstream. As the flow of blood is suppresse d, the body protects the torso first, and the extremities become starved of opt imum blood supply with many potential consequences. Once the colon has been clea ned out, the liver is confident enough to dump more of its st ored toxins into the exit syst em, and sometimes thousands of these little stones, together with the toxins, ar e washed from the body. That certainly happened to Pam and me. The differe nce in health is amazing, not least in the glow of the skin as it s blood supply increases. My friends couldn't believe how much better I was looking. Pam had suffered for some years from a skin disorder called Rosacea, which conventional 'medicine' says is incurable and can only be kept in check by constant antibiotics. But her condition di sappeared in days with th e colon cleanse because it is caused by toxins in the liver. If the build-up of to xins is not dealt with, especially if you have a very toxic lifes tyle, the liver even tually becomes overwhelmed and the body dies from liver failure.

If you have a serious liver cleanse lock away the crockery. I stress again that emotion, be it anger, depression, whatever, is not a functi on of what I am calli ng consciousness beyond the hologram. Emotions are programmed reac tions transmitted through DNA. Love and emotion is not th e same thing, nor is emotion and empathy, and I will expand on this later. Many pharmaceutical drugs /t oxins have been linked with depression, but how can drugs and poisons directly affect consciousness? They can't. What they do is affect the DNA's decodi ng system and, through that , produce the feeling of depression and other ps ychological consequences in the emotion program. It is like a computer malfunction. During the colon cleanse, and on many other occasions, I have met healers who believe that different parts of the body have their ow n brain. They say the digestive system has a brain, as does the immune system, liver and othe r organs. This must be the case because the body is a holog ram and this is wh y these organs and systems have the ability to communicate a nd react to events and changes in the most extraordinary way. The hologram ensu res that there will indeed be a smaller version of the brain in ev ery part of the body. The DNA/RNA communicates and receives information to and from every pa rt of the body and the brain acts as coordinator. When the colon is blocked and the liver has nowhere to send its toxins this information is communicated through the body's Internet' system and the computer takes the appropriate action. We see this as liver stones. In this case it is akin to a computerised canal system in wh ich the sluice gates are closed in reaction to changing circumstances. The process of heal ing wounds, sto pping blood loss and all the billions of other ways the body reacts, is the DNA/RNA co mmunicating information in accordance with the program. One other point to re member is that the body/hologram is two- thirds water. This is esse ntial to every function of th e body, includin g maintenance of temperature, and, as Masaru Emoto' s work has established, water stores information. It is also a superb medium th rough which to transm it the electrical and other frequency signals passing around the DNA. The body in th is sense is like a battery and when the water levels fall because we don't drink enough it has a similar effect to a car battery with too little distilled water - it doesn't work as well. Among the many signs and sympto ms of too little water in the body are headaches, poor concentration and tiredness. All ar e the result of the DNA communications falling below optimum. But let us not forget th at even this is on ly happening in our heads and, on a higher level of awareness, that's illusion also. In a healthy body the DNA is communicating accurately between different parts of the computer through the RN A, and what is termed dise ase, or dis-ease, is when the system malfunctions. Ther e are endless causes for th is, but all have the same theme: they affect the accuracy of the information pa ssing through the DNA/RNA. People who live near power lines or wo rk with electromagn etic technology are more prone to certain ailments and cancers. In Britain, they are installing a stream of so-called Tetra masts as part of the communication network for the emergency services. The masts emit pul ses in the frequency range of human brain waves. I"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"101 have been told that the technology was in troduced through the US National Security Agency, a 100 per cent Illuminati-controlled operation. This makes sense because the Tetra masts are qu ite rightly being connected with increases in cancers and other physical, mental and emotional disorders - including depression - where they are located. The reason for these effects is that electromagnetic, mi crowave and other frequencies disrupt the input/output sy stem of DNA/RNA, and the computer gives and receives inaccurate information. It's like talki ng on a mobile phone when the connection is bad. You only catch certain words a nd you can't understand what the other person is trying to say. In the human body these disrupted communications act like a co mputer virus and this is what cancer is. Cells are constantly reproducing and all is well whil e they are copied accu rately. For this to happen, the DNA/RNA communica tion to the cell needs to be accu rate. Once an electromagnetic field or other source disrup ts the quality of the information, the cell begins to reproduce flawed copies, often at inappropriate speeds and we call this cancer. It can spread like a computer virus affecting ever greater areas of the program until the comput er can no longer function. I ha d a virus in a computer that began with a slight disruption and gather ed pace until you c ould not even switch the thing on. And what do we say in thos e circumstances? The computer is dead. So it is with the body. The potential for the malfunction we call illness is immense in the 'modern' world because of the way soci ety is structured. We are to ld that stre ss is a great killer. Yes it is - but why? When emotions ge t out of balance they begin to affect the communication network. One of the first places to be troubled is the intestinal area with 'butterflies in the stomach', fear, nausea and 'the shits'. This is okay so long as it is within reason and not a constant burden to the system. But when the stress reaches seriously high levels, and especi ally if it's ongoing, a much wider area of the system begins to malfunction. We see skin rashes, stomach ulcers, cancer and that major expres sion of stress - heart disease. There is also anothe r aspect to emotional disease th at I experienced in Hawaii. In the chiropractor's waiting r oom was a book by Dr John E. Sarno, Professor of Clinical Rehabilitation Medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and attending physician at th e Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medi cal Center. It was called H ealing Back Pain: The Mind- Body Connection (Warner Books, 1991), and detailed his more than 20 years of research linking pain to the mind/brain. Fo r sure, it is the brain that manifests pain by decoding the messages sent from the apparent source of discomfort. When you rang your toe you don't actually feel the pain until the brain has processed the message and decided it hurts. One way that severe pain is treated is by stopping the messages from, say an arthritic knee, from being communicated to the brain. Without the message there can be no pai n. If you can use your consciousness to change the belief system of the brain yo u can walk through fire without being burned. Many people do firewalking across red hot coals without feeling any heat, let alone discomfort. They are walking th rough the fire only in their heads and "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"102 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion whether it hurts or not is decided by the wa y their brain interprets reality. There are those, like some Yogis and Tibetan monks, who can slow their heart rate to almost nil, sit naked in freezing weather and consci ously generate such internal heat that they can dry wet towels laid on their back s. They are using their consciousness to override the program and wrest control of their reality from the Matrix. Dr John E. Sarno identified the conn ection between mind and body and how mental and emotional states can lead to physical consequences. Sarno's findings, backed up by two decades of successfully treating 'unbeat able' cases, suggest that the major cause of pain in the back, neck, shoulders, bum and limbs is repressed emotion. The chiropractor told me how he had suffered from severe back pain that nothing would alleviate until he read Sarno's book. He follo wed the advice to identify the emotions that were being suppressed and he realised he had been in fear of something without even knowing. Once he made the connection the back pain disappeared. This is how Sarno has successfully treated many thousands of patients without surgery or drugs even t hough conventional medicine said they were incurable. The act of observation and identification of the emotional cause unlocks the information stored in the hologram (hard dr ive) and allows it to be deleted. When the data recording the emo tional response is removed, its 'physical' expression disappears just as qu ickly. The chiropractor's wife had been suffering from serious neck pain and he could do nothing to help her until they connected the problem to the death of her cat some weeks earlier. She'd had the cat sin ce it was born and the loss caused severe emotional trauma, even more than she rea lised. When the link had been acknowledged her extreme neck pa in was gone. It's funny how we say of people who cause us em otional upset or frustration: 'They are a pain in the neck'. I also saw the connection be tween my own neck and spine problems and serious emotional challenges I had be en experiencing for weeks before. Again this is the interaction of the mind a nd emotional programs of th e DNA and how they disrupt the balance and accuracy of the communications. You can experience this interaction just by thinking of something sad, depressing or frightening. It doesn't have to be happening because your thoughts alone are enough to trigger the emotional response. Scientists have established that the same parts of the brain Tight up' whether a person is actually having an experience or just thinking about it. Th e Illuminati are constantly manipulating this system by delivering information to the collective mind designed to trigger the desired collective emotional reaction. Healer Mike Lambert also points out that the areas of the body that Dr. Sarno treats most effectively are directly connected in acupuncture to the gall bladder (a source of depression when imbalanced) and the liver (a source of anger when imbalanced). The interconnection between body and emotion through the DNA means that emotions can affect the body and the body can affect emotions. Toxins in the cells can cause depression and anger while this - and all emotion - stimulates the release of chemicals that are absorbed by the cells. Talk about a vicious cycle. But it can be broken by consciousness. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Physician, Heal Thy Computer Virus 103 Interestingly, the study of the body's meridian system at the Necker Hospital in Paris using the radioactive tr acers revealed that energy passed more slowly through the meridian of a diseased organ than it did through a healthy one. Mike Lambert also told me of experiments that showed how e-motion-al states caused the flow of information - motion - around the body to slow down. As this vibrant movement of information is curtailed, the body computer malfuncti ons and so emotional stress causes illness. Heart attacks in particular ar e caused by static en ergy and this is how those with severe grief are said to have 'died of a broken heart' soon after they lose a loved one. The slower the energy moves the slower th e vibrational state of the body and we get pulled further into density. When we are in a depressed or emotionally stressed state we actually talk about 'feelin g heavy'. Rigid opinions and suppression of free thought and action also stem the flow and cause the hologram to vibrate slower. Valerie Hunt, Professo r of Kinesiology at the University of California in Los Angeles, has developed the use of technology to measure the human energy field and this has confirmed that a person's state of being effects their vibrational speed or fr equency. Those focused only on five-sense reality (mind and emotions) have energy fields that vibr ate at a lower frequency than those who use their higher senses (con sciousness). As humans beca me dominated by fear, so they fell further in to density (the 'Fall of Man'??). Chemicals in food and drink also emit frequencies that disrupt the information flow and the appalling 'food' produced by th e Illuminati corporations is destroying human health. Everything in the Matrix is a frequency carrying a harmonious or disruptive resonance. With chemical fo od it's the latter an d this can quickly undermine the input/output signals of th e DNA/RNA. Morgan Spurlock's movie, Super Size Me (see supersizeme.com), reve aled the devastating effects on the body of eating fast food. The Ne w Yorker ate three meals at McDonalds every day for a month and his health was monitored by doctors. The outcome was devastating. Within days he went from being a fit, healthy 33-year-old, to vomiting, suffering headaches and depression, an d losing his sex drive. Hi s liver became overwhelmed by saturated fats and Dr Dary l Isaacs described Spurlock's liver test as shocking. Tt became very, very abnormal', he said. Spurlock put on a lot of weight in just one month and he said he became desperately ill. 'My face was splotchy and I had this huge gut, which I've never had in my life ', he said. Tt was amazing - and really frightening.' Goodness knows what the h ealth effects are going to be on today's fast-food chomping, cola-swi gging, chemical-riddled ge neration. You might note, too, that Spurlock said that he became depressed while on his fast food diet. This was the chemicals affecting the DNA communications we call emotion. The computer I am working on now is protected by software called Norton AntiVirus. It seeks out disruptive code s and information that would normally spread like cancer through the computer until it eventually 'die d'. The body has its version of Norton , too. It is called the Immune Sy stem. This is th e software that seeks out the bod y's version of the computer virus and removes it before it gets out of control.

This is the very environment in which cancer and other di sease can flourish unchallenged. I saw a documentary once that showed the immune system's white blood cells destroying cancer cells. This is an everyday occurr ence. When your immune system is working properly you don't die from cancer because the problem is nipped in the bud. It is when the system is unde rmined or overwhelmed by multiple attacks that the defences are breached, and our Illuminati-created societies are designed to do precisely that with all the shite food, drink, stress and electromagnetic pollution. The drug thalidomide rewrote the DNA/RNA program in unborn children to such an extent that they were born without limbs and, for the same reason, the radiation scattered across Iraq by Am erican and British weapons containing sp ent uranium has led to the unspe akable birth defects in children that I highlighted in Tales from the Time Loop. Radiation shor t-circuits DNA communication. What we call genetic diseases are flaws in the pare nts' DNA passed to the child when the two 'disks' are downloaded onto one in what we call procreation. Genetic disease is an inherited problem with th e DNA's ability to comm unicate accurately and, depending on what form this takes, the child becomes more liable to manifest"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"106 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else Is Illusion a particular disease. The current attacks on the DNA by the Illu minati are likely to lead to an increase in ge netic flaws because of the changes being caused by our food, drink, electromagnetic pollution and othe r environmental factors. But, and it's a very big but, this doesn't have to be. We can use our consciou sness to dictate the program and wrest control from food additiv es or any other disruptive influence. Consciousness is not more powerful than a Tetra ma st or a chemical sweetener? Please. Japanese scientist, Masaru Emoto, ha s found that low frequency water reacts extremely negatively when e xposed to low frequencies; but high frequency water is not affected at all by low fr equencies. This makes sense because they are not on the same wavelength and when we operate in high frequency st ates we are not affected by the low frequency bombardme nt in our food, drink and environment. As I said earlier, Valerie Hunt, professo r of kinesiology at the Univ ersity of California in Los Angeles, has found that people focused only on five -sense reality (mind and emotions) have energy fields that vibrat e at a lower frequency than those who use their higher senses (conscious ness). This whole Illuminati global society is designed to keep us in a low frequency state so we play by their rules in their vibratory realm. I am all for the development of what is called alternative, or complementary, healing. These are the healing techniques that treat the body as a series of vibrational fields, which can be harmonis ed through hands-on healing (transmitting energy to the patient); acupuncture (rebalancing energy flows and DNA/RNA communication); reflexology (usi ng a smaller vers ion of the hologr am to treat the whole); aromatherapy (accessing the hologr am through the sense of smell); and the countless other methods that operate on th e same principles. But these are not the end in themselves. They are stepping-stone s to the realisation that we can use our consciousnesses to heal ourselves. DNA is a receiver/transmitter/amplifier and it can either be aligned to the transmissions of the Matrix and its inherited 'genetic' program, or to Infinite C onsciousness. We can allow the Matrix to communicate to our DNA and dictate events, and flaws in the DNA to control our life; or we can impose our consciousness on the situation and change th e outcome. It is not DNA that is the problem, but what is communicating with it and disrupting its balance. There is no need to cut out bi ts of the body to 'cure' peop le. We just have to restore vibrational harmony to replace the dishar mony that causes dis-ease. And we do that through vibrational means, not the scalpel and the drug. Consciousness has the power to communic ate its will to DNA and override the dictates of the Matrix and the inherite d software. We can rebalance the DNA and heal ourselves - and even stop the illusory ageing process - by sending different instructions and rewriting th e program. We can be govern or of our own experience even within the Matrix if we choose to wake up from our hypnotic state. A computer may be able to do some amazing things, but in the end you are in control of it. Type in the right c odes and it works perfectly. Type in the wrong ones and it can go haywire. It is the same w ith the body hologram. The DNA is a transmitter/receiver and it does not have an exclusive contract with any single "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Physician, Heal Thy Computer Virus 107 broadcaster. Are we going to allow the Matrix to di ctate events through our DNA or are we, Infinite Consciousness, going to intervene and demand our right to decide our own experience? Are we going to ride the horse or go on letting the horse ride us? Now, let's go to another level with this because what I have been describing are also illusions. When you deprogram still further you re alise that there is no illness because there is no body. How can your body be ill when you haven't got one? 'Good morning, doctor; I ha ve a pain in my belly' 'Madam, you don't have a belly so it cannot hurt.' 'Thank you, doctor; I th ink that's cured it.' Illness, like everything else except In finite Love, is illus ion. We only get ill because the program tells us to believe we can get ill. It is feeding us that reality and our DNA/RNA is decoding the message s into our apparent 3D experience. My DNA/RNA is manifesting the illusion th at I have arthritis and until I can disconnect from that reality at a deep level my joints will remain swollen and painful. I have said that we see with our brain and not our eyes. But here's another little shocker. There are no eyes. If reality is construc ted in our brain how can we have any eyes on th e outside of the brain? Look in the mirror and you can see your eyes, but everything you are s eeing is happening inside your brain - including the eyes staring back at you in the mirror. People who have 'near death' or 'out-of-body' experiences describe how they could still see while they were looking down at their bodies lying on the operating table or wherever. If we see with our eyes, or indeed even our br ain, how come we can see without them? Because they are another level of the illusion. I am sitting here now wearing reading-glasses so that I can see the co mputer screen because 'my eyes are not what they were'. But how can my eyes not be what they were when they never were in the first place? We are told that light comes in through the eyes and is turned into electrical signals that the brain decodes. On one level of the illusion that does appear to happen; but go higher and there are no eyes so how can they process 'light'? There is no 'light' as there is no 'dark'. They, too, are illusions. People go blind when they have a defect in the eyes for the same reason that I have arthritis. The belief that you need eyes to see is wr itten into the program and the DNA/RNA decodes this as blindness when the illusory eyes appear to malfunction. Only consciousness can change that by overriding the software. Like I say, the brain is another level of the illusion sold to us by the Matrix. It is the body computer's central processing unit decoding the false reality broadcast by the Matrix into the 'world' we think we see. But the brai n is also a hologram and therefore an illusion. There are many levels to the maze and when you peel them away you are left with only Infinite Co nsciousness - Infinite Love. The world looks a lot less scary when you realise there is no world, eh? And the fear of death loses its po wer when you know that you have no body and so it cannot 'die'. What a hoot it all is, this 'life' we take so seriously. Go on, have a good laugh, mate; it's bloody hysterical.

He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest Oscar Wilde ne of the major expressions of the Matrix program in this reality is what we call Religion, and that's not only Christiani ty, Judaism, Islam and the others we associate with that term. I also mean th e religions we call money, politics, the pursuit of 'success', televisi on, the cult of celebrity and what has been dubbed the 'New Age'. Anything, in fact, that dictates your sense of reality and entraps you in the illusion. The Matrix loves religions. They are the diversions that hold consciousness in the headlights of an oncoming fairytale. Which fairytale you choose to believe doesn't much matter so l ong as you buy into one of th em and, of course, your DNA is always there to guide you. The id ea is to keep you focused on on e obsession so you don't see the guy at the stove preparing the gravy. Horses have wide peripheral vision and some wear blinkers to ensure they can only see what's in front of them and not the panorama they wo uld normally see. The blinkers are there to focus the horse on the desired activity - the race - an d stop it being distracted by other horses or influences. The religions in all their fo rms are blinkers for humans. They are there to discourage consciousne ss from seeing beyond the program because they are focused on one predominant belief or goa l. The Silent Weapons for a Quiet War document said: 'Keep them busy, busy, bu sy, back on the farm with the other animals'. The Matrix wants to keep the ce ll door bolted and relig ions have served the cause magnificently. They entrap people in laws, irrelevance, and fine detail to such an extent that the big pictur e is never seen (Figure 62, overleaf). A great example of this is hair. I didn't realise that ha ir was so important until I began to check what different religions told their followers to believe about it. The things you learn. Did you know that the Tora h (the five books of 'Moses' in the Old Testament) forbids a male Jew from removi ng hair from his side burns? No, really, this must be very profound then, I guess. But why, dear God, is this considered so vital? Well the Torah, no, let's be specific, Leviticus 19:27, says: 'Do not shave around the sides of your head, nor harm th e edges of your beard'. Is that it? Yep, seems like it. If you really study the detail, though, there are so me get-out clauses. 109 O"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"110 Phew. The sideburns merely have to be long enough that you can pull on the hair; and the beard can be shaved, but only if you use an instrument that isn't sharp. Mmmm. Is it me or do you see the same contradiction here? But this is God's law and there can be no contradictions, so it must be us, I suppose. The law sa ys you must not use a straight razor, including safety-razors, on your temples or to shave your beard. Jewish men who don't want a beard have various options, I read. They can use 'depilatory powder' (hair removal products), or scissors with 'two relatively dull blades to pinch off the hair, rather than one very sharp blade slicing it off. Ouch. There is some good news, though - electric shavers are okay! Yippee. But hold on. Aren't they sharp so they can cut the hair, isn't that the idea? God must have missed that one. Not all electric shavers are within the law and you are advised apparently to check with your local Orthodox rabbi for acceptable brands. He might have a stock in the back room. The Devil' s in the detail so here's some more from faqs.org: 'Actually, the sideburns merely have to be long enough that one can pull on the hair, and the beard area can be shaved with something other than a sharp blade (many people accept the use of electric shavers) . But, specifically within the Chassidic community, there is a custom not to shave (and frequently not even to trim) the beard, and to permit the sideburn area (all the way up to the top of the ear) to grow long as well (the long sideburns are called peyos). Some tuck the hair up under their kippa/skullcap, while others curl the hair. Many Orthodox say the payos (aka earlocks/sidelocks) begin right at the temple, to just behind the ear, a nd must grow no shorter than the top of the cheekbone. Then they are to be worn pushed forward of the ear so as to be visible ... M any who grow long peyos do so for Kabbalistic reasons. One of the opinions in Kabbalah is that the peyos need to be worn long only until the beard grows in. Once the beard grows, the peyos of the side of the head should not be allowed to grow down beyond where the sides of the beard begin to appear.' 1 "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"111 Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Has he finished yet? All these laws about the hair on your face are only one example of the web of contro l, often fine-detaile d control, provided through the God Progra m software and it's not only Jewish people wh o have their lives dictated in this way. Muslims wear beards, too, and the Ko ran tells them what to think, as the Torah and ot her blinker-books te ll Jews and Christians. I typed the question, 'Why do Muslims wear beards?' into Google and saw that many don't seem to know. But one guy, Dr Muzaffar Iqba l, the founder-presid ent of the Center for Islam and Science in Canada, did offer an explanation in his column in the New Islamabad. In summary, he says that Musl ims should be inspired to be like the Prophet and, 'when applied to the outward aspects', this meant that such a person makes an effort to change one's habits, dres s, appearance and rout ines of the day to a close resemblance to the li fe of the Prophet, upon whom be peace and blessings'. Beards for men were one such attribute, sa id the doctor, in lin e with the Prophet's command reported in Bukhari, Bo ok 72, no. 781: 'Tri m your moustaches and leave the beard [as it is]'. 2 Well, some guy in the seventh cent ury is reported to have said don't trim your beard, so w ho are we to question it? No wonder the word 'Muslim' means 'One who surrenders'. So now we have Jews being told by the Torah to wear beards and Muslims told by the Koran. The hair thing is just as important to Sikhs, too. At least Jews and Muslims can cut the hair on their heads, but not so with Sikhs. They are to barbers what vegans are to th e meat industry. Sikhs do n't cut their hair and instead gather it together under a turban. They also go for the Long Beard Program. One reason for this is that if hair wasn't pleasing to God, they ask, why did he cause it to grow? The Sikh gurus (see rabbis, priests and cler ics) strongly advise d Sikhs to accept God's will (common to all versions of th e God Program) and not cutting the hair symbolises this, so I read. Sikhs believe that God didn't make any mistakes in how he created the human form (George W. Bus h, I rest my case) and out of respect for that belief Sikhs choose to keep their bodies unchanged from the way God created them. This includes the fact that Si kh men remain uncircumcised, except for medical reasons (I thought Go d didn't make mistakes .. .). But as with all belief when faced with practicality, they pepper in the contradi ctions to get themselves out of the dogma-created holes. For instance, they say that if God didn't want hair to grow why did he make it grow? But I have a ques tion: why do Si khs cut their nails then? Have no fear, they have considered the fine print and there is an answer to this contradiction that I have, once agai n, quite wrongly identified. A Sikh website exposed the er ror of my observation: 'Sikhism believes in having a truthful, honest living and progressing in life. Nails have been given to us so that we may work and walk. For example, if you lift any object up with your fingers you will see the pressure on your nails. Nails also help us to walk. If you decide not to cut your nails, when you work they will eventually snap off. So therefore Sikhism allows them to be cut.'"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"112 I wonder how long th e lawyers worked on that one. I also read how some believe the hair must not be cut because it is an antenna that connects us to God. So where does that leave bald people? What have they done for God to block their e-mails? But, not to worry, the hairless can make contact with another part of the God Program by being a Buddhist. They have no problem with baldies. Buddhists shave their heads to 'renounce all the mundane desires and longings to more readily achieve purity, be free from delusions, remove hindrances and enter the way of practice'. And once they shave their heads, they can easi ly be distinguished from others (if not from each other). Roman Catholic nuns also cut their hair as a symbol of their life of self-sacrifice to God and renunciation of worldly things. A woman's ha ir is considered her crowning glory and is often a source of vanity, the Roman Catholic thought-police say. In order to avoid this vanity the nun covers her head and cu ts her hair short. No w what's the word I am looking for with all this? Oh yeah, pathetic. The scale of religious imposition can be breathtaking and its underlying weapon is always the fear equation: fear = contro l = power for the Matrix (Figure 63). Firstly, the God Program puts its fo llowers in a state of fear about upsetting God and missing out on the ticket to paradise. Then it gives them rules to follow to keep God sweet and save them from the place wh ere the fires burn. Dean Hamer, an American molecular genetic ist, concluded after comp aring more than 2,000 DNA samples that a person's capacity to believe in God is linked to brain chemicals. He explained his theory in The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes (Doubleday, 2004). This certainly fits with what I am suggesting in this book. The God Program will be more powerful in so me people than others because the realisation that religion is nonsense re writes the DNA softwa re and dilutes the influence of the men in frocks on others in the same gene tic line. It also works the other way, too, of course. I am not surprised that Hamer connects belief in God to brain chemicals because this is a way the software interacts with the body hologram. In September 2004,1 saw a television documentary series called Jewish Law, on Britain's Channel 4. What it revealed was a fa ntastic example of what I mean by"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"113 religions serving the Matrix. The series fe atured Jewish people trying to follow the strict Judaistic law in every area of their lives. And I mean every. It was so extreme it was almost funny, but by the end I fo und myself deeply sad fo r these people. They are imprisoned in a daily dictatorship of fear, based on laws decreed through ancient Biblical texts wr itten thousands of years ag o by unknown authors and administered by the Rabbinic al Thought Police. Early in the first show we found Rabbi Kaye, a kosher-inspector for an organi sation called Beth Din in Manchester in the North West of England. He was in his library wher e the shelves were packed with books detailing the shoulds and shou ldn'ts, musts and mustn'ts, which an orthodox Jew has to ob serve. He said: This book here actually tells us what you do when you get up in the morning, how one gets dressed, how one acts - before praying in the morning we don't eat - how you can greet someone in the morning, what you can say before you pray, what you can't say, how you get to the synagogue, what you do in the synagogue, what happens if you turn up a little late for prayers, what bits yo u miss out, all these things are all there.' You get the picture. The Be th Din organisation employs 30 'dietary inspectors' to police the establishments where kosher fo od and drink is prod uced. You probably know about the kosher meat laws which insist that animals are bled to death, like the halal meat of the Muslims - but ko sher law goes much further than the technique of slaughter. It ensures that everything conforms to the astonishingly voluminous and comple x dietary laws written down more than ten centuries ago. As Beth Din's Rabbi Furst said: 'We have a tradition given down to us from Mount Sinai. When God gave Moses the writte n Torah he also gave him an oral explanation of all of this in the tiniest, tiniest detail .' It must have been a long conversation from what I co uld see and Moses must have had a memory to die for. Rabbi Furst also explained that the law allo wed them to eat part of an insect, but not a whole one. I'm not sure there is much good news th ere, really. Kosher food- inspector, Rabbi Klarberg, added the ride r that this did not mean they could purposely cut up an insect to find a loophol e in the law that says you can't eat a whole one. I breathed deeply wondering if I had morphe d to another planet. Why anyone would want to circum vent a law that says you can't eat an insect was lost on me. But then I was in really strange territory. Sholem Josephs, of the Swiss Cottage Baker y, said that if he had meat in one of his ovens he wouldn't dare ba ke anything else in there until he had called the rabbi and agreed a way to make the oven kosher again. He also point ed out that kosher food costs more, not least beca use, like all such businesses, he is billed every month by Beth Din for policing his kitchens a nd giving the crucial stamp of approval. Maintaining the kosher eating laws is very profitable as well as being spectacularly over the top. But how can you question Moses or whoever invented him? That would be blasphemy. In an other scene, a guy was vi siting a rabbi with a new electric kettle. Rabbi Brodie explained to him th at Jewish pots, pans and kettles were immersed in a bo dy of water because it was considered a sign of purity. I think "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"114 it's what the rest of us ca ll cleaning new pans before y ou use them. But no, this was a spiritual and religious ritual. 'I hope you have ma ny, many good cups of tea from it', the rabbi said. 'Having sanctified it, I'm sure the tea will taste better.' Soon we were back with kosher-inspect or, Rabbi Kaye, and the drama heightened. He faced a serious problem. A rabbi in London who was flying up to join him the next morning for an inspect ion in Aberdeen, Sc otland, was worried that his flight time would stop him from praying when the law said he must. He would have to leave home befo re it was time to pray and would be in the air at the critical moment. I didn't understand why he couldn't just pray on the plane, something I have done many times myself while flying with local airlines in South America. From what I gathered - and it did get a bit garbled at this stage - the rabbi had to pray in the first four hours af ter dawn. God demanded this, apparently. Rabbi Kaye went to work to solve his friend's crisis. He opened the Hebrew calendar on his laptop and there was gr eat relief. There wa s a way around it. Somehow you always knew there would be. In his hotel room, as he waited for th e London guy, Rabbi Kaye covered his head and performed the first of the obligatory three prayers of the day - as opposed to the five of the Muslims (I wonder who wins on penalties?). Th e rabbi's prayer involved rocking back and forth in the way I have se en them do at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. At one point, he also wore a sort of little blac k chimney or box thing which are collectively known as tefillin. It was a square, and far smaller, version of the top hat worn by the Fat Controller in Thomas the Tank Engine. In another programme we were told mo re about why Jewish men 'strap on boxes', as the narrator put it. This immediately took my mi nd to cricket, baseba ll and other sports in which the manhood has to be protected from injury by a hard 'box' or cup. But these tefillin do not protect the balls, th ey perpetuate it. They contain little compartments each fille d with a parchment inscribed w ith religious texts and they are worn to remind Jews th at God rescued them from bondage in Egypt. He was obviously on vacation when the Ba bylon captivity deal went down. The legitimacy of the tefillin has to be checked regularly. Ra bbi Dansky told us that this must be done becau se if you don't follow the will of God you earn 'no brownie points'. Hold on a second while I come to terms with how stupid this God must be, what a total wally-brain, to be concerned about whether anyone wears this thing on their head or what is in it. Nope, that le vel of ludicrousness is beyond my imagination. Anyway, Rabbi Dansky is nothing if not th orough. We saw him with his measuring gauge to ensure th e tefillin were square to within one millimetre. He said they don't really understand why they have to be square, it was a mitzvah (law) decreed some three t housand years ago that 'we just have to accept and do without [knowing] '. You suspect there are a lot of those. Each scroll had to be in the right orde r or the tefillin would be i nvalid, the same with even a small scuff on the leather chin strap, the ra bbi said. When they wear out they have to be buried, even the little stitches that become detached. Ra bbi Dansky told us that he made sure this happened by hoovering his office and burying the dustbag. He seemed to bury quite a lot. He said that all old prayer books, even newspaper "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"115 articles about the Torah, had to be buried, too. The previous year he had buried seven tons of the stuff. Rabbi Kaye and his London friend headed for the fish market in Aberdeen. The voice-over told us that in or der to be kosher the fish ha d to have fins and scales. I thought what a relief it must have been to find that they had, not least for the fish. This statement was given no elaboration and I take it this meant the fish had to have fins and scales when on the dinner plat e, but I can't be sure. Every additive to the fish and every ot her kosher food has to be checked. Kosher certificates must be going out thick and fast - ma tched, of course, by the cheques coming the other way. As he drove home with what appeared to be a music tape playing in the car, Rabbi Kaye told us that they were not allowed to listen to music, except at weddings. I guess anything by Meatloaf wo uld definitely be out anyway, unless he had been inspected. So was the rabbi br eaking the law as the music played in his car? Oh no, all sorted. See get-out-clause No 766, 859, 494. His tape was not music, it was purely vocal, he said. You got th e impression that even he didn't buy that one. Animals are only kosher if they have split hooves and ch ew the cud. One documentary took us to a farm where th ey were making kosher and non-kosher milk. A farmworker said ther e wasn't much diffe rence in the process, really, but I guess the farm still had to put the cheque in the post. Listening to the farm's kosher- inspector from Beth Din, it seemed like easy money to me. I quote him word for word in case you think I am making this up: 'I would be here quite a lot during the milking to ensure that there are no other animals in the herd other than cows.' Other animals such as? 'A buffalo.' After a slight paus e for reflection on how daft hi s answer was, he went on: '... We do know there are no other animals in the herd, it's very unusual to have a mixed herd anyhow, but all the same the requi rements are that we are here. That is what makes the milk kosher, the very fact we are here checking, although there is no real difference in the milk.' Could you file that one wi th the insect loop hole, please? Thanks so much, the file's marked 'Bewildered'. Rabbi Furst stood be side a pile of doug h, the bread kind. He said it contained a piece of every dough made at the bakery in the last 36 hours and he was going to perform a special bl essing to separate something from the dough in line with the Commandments. I never did understand exactly what he was separating and even after playing back the video I couldn't work it out. Perhaps that was a good thin g. He said some Hebrew wo rds as he piled bits of dough on top of each other and announced th at he had designated this as 'Halla' or "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"116 Sabbath bread. The term Halla, a Jewish website told me, is 'a name used in ancient times to designate the priest's share of the dough'. I know, I thought the same. Rabbi Furst said that his words had made all the difference. 'N ow it has a special level of holiness and I ha ve to dispose of it in a respec table way.' Dispose of it? If it was that holy why bin it, respectfully or otherwise? The rabbi had the answer. If they had a temple this dough would go to the priests, he said, but as they hadn't it would be thrown in the tras h. Well, not directly because it would be disrespectful and against the law to do that. Instead, he explained, he put it in a plastic bag and then put that in another one. Wow, deep respect. 'The fact th at we have doubled- bagged it is considered to be a respectful way of disposing of it', he said. The rabbi told us that he had no choice but to dump the dough becaus e no one except the priests was allowed to eat it. All other Jews were 'not in a state of spiritual purity'. Who said so? The priests, I suppose. Once the rabbi had said his words to make the leftovers holy, he said that all the rest of the dough, from which the holy pile came, was considered not holy and ordinary Jews could eat it. Are you still there, you've gone quiet? Rabbi Furst was filmed cracking what seemed to be an endless line of eggs to see if they had any blood spots in them. The reporter asked him to explain what he was doing and the rabbi said the law on this wa s complicated. I instinctively trembled at what might be to come after my experien ce with the severed insect, buffalo man, and the holy dough deal. He said the Torah ordered implicitly that a Jewish person shouldn't eat blood from an animal. Simp le enough, but not for long. There was the question of what kind of blood was in an egg and if it was bl ood they needed to worry about or not. Orthodo x Jews, like the obsessive advocates of all the major religions, seem to do a lot of worrying, but then that's the idea . He concluded, for reasons that escaped me, that blood in eggs was not the type that was so important to avoid but, neverthe less, he would still check every eg g to get rid of it. Rabbi Furst said that they spent a lot of time saying, 'what if? What if this happened, what if that happened? By now you had no troubl e believing him. I' ll let him speak for himself about the theological minefield that is a Cheese Danish: 'Now they make a little Danish and they put a dollop of cheese in the middle. Sometimes the cheese will over flow the edges. If that Danish happened to be at the end of the sheet and the cheese spread out and over the edge of the tray it would fall onto the floor of the oven; and it would give it a dairy quality; and if they then put a loaf of bread in there right away that bread would have a dairy quality. 'So, I have gone to great lengths to convince the bakers to bake their Cheese Danish in trays that have edges on all four sides so they won't have this possibility of \"what if the cheese goes over the edge?\"' By now I wondered if it was me or th e rabbi who would be joining the cheese first. I am sure that thousands of y ears ago, sometimes even today, there were health reasons for some of these dietary habits, but the obsession with them and the "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"117 life-controlling strictness of them is off th e wall, Wailing and ever other. There are also the hypocritical expressi ons of the Jewish laws li ke the one that bans the drinking of wine that is not made by Je ws. AskMoses.com says that wine is only kosher if it has not been 'handled by a non-Jew before the bottle is sealed ...'. I wonder why that isn't considered racist when it would be if anyone else did the same? Personally, I don't care what anyone freely chooses to eat and drink, it's none of my business, but I am si ck of this we-can-do-it-bu t-you-can't arrogance that pervades such matters. The God Program is full of this hypocrisy. Rabbi Dayan Berger (there seemed to be a lot of them ) explained that the wi ne law was there to 'put obstacles and di fficulties in the way' to discourage the mi suse of wine. How it made any difference to get pissed on wine made by Jews or wine made by non-Jews was never made clear and I wo ndered if they weren't maki ng up much of this as they went along. It is a common trait with the 'interpreters' of religious law - T think what God meant to say ...'. The rabbi said the Jews-only wine thing went back a long time to when idol worshipping was prevalent (what ten minutes ago?) and 'people came across a bit of wine, they so mehow tried to turn it into an act of worship ...'. I do know the feeling. Rabbi Furst said the ovens in kosher bakeries can only be turned on by a Jew and only brou ght up to temperature by a Jew. 'That makes the bread a more spiritual product', he said. If a Christian Caucasian said that he would be called a 'White Supremacist'. What's the difference? Another programme in the Jewish Law seri es focused on the laws of the Sabbath every Saturday, and th e Passover, the biggest Jewish festival of the year, that commemorates the exodus of the Israelite s from Egypt. During the eight days of Passover they are not allowed to eat anyt hing that rises (okay, okay, enough) like leavened bread or an ything that has been fermented. Rabbi Dovid Jaffe told us that this was because the Jews le ft Egypt in such a hurry th at the bread they had made didn't have time to rise. Du ring Passover they eat flat bread instead. Not only is leavened bread forbidden, all traces of it have to be purged fr om the house. Rifka Domnitz said from her kitc hen: 'The whole house is cleaned out because we're looking for leaven, anything that might be br ead, cakes, any sort of crumbs; also we don't have whisky, vinegar, anything that's fermented, [like] beer. So the whole house has to be scrubbed.' I' m not sure about the 'has to'. There is no 'has to' unless the will is conceded to insane religious Taw'. In another house a 'special Passover cooke r' was hauled from the back shed and it replaces the other one for eight da ys a year. I must say the two looked remarkably similar. Even a microwave was covered in tin foil to thwart any lingering bread crumbs that might be poise d to condemn the occupants to the fires of Hell. The lady of the house told us that no matter how cl ean she may get the microwave there might still be something there. 'If I put a hot pot of chicken soup under [the microwave] the steam might disl odge crumbs or leaven into the pot.' That was a close one then. They were 'ver y, very stringent about everything', the lady said, and you needed no convincing. By way of confirma tion we cut to a woman using a paint-stripper flame-thrower to make sure there was absolutely no leaven on the sink and draining board. If only people were equally obsessed with "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"118 making sure no one went without food, wa rmth, shelter and the opportunity to live their dreams. But I supp ose God is too busy panicking over the deadly perils of a Cheese Danish to concern himself wi th such irrelevance. It was pointed out that the women do all the work while th e men 'set the religious tone'. As one woman said of her husband: 'He sets the spiritual tone and I do it the way he wants. Left to my own devices, I don't kn ow what I'd do. I have no idea.' Sadly most people have no idea what they would do either if left to their own devices because they've never tried it. The best bit was when Rabbi Avraham Jaffe told us that all rabbis had sent forms to their congregation asking that they appoi nt their rabbi to sell all their forbidden products to a non-Jew for the duration of Pa ssover. The non-Je w pays his money and all the stuff belongs to hi m. There is, however, a clause in his contract that says that if he wants to sell it all back after Passover because he can't make a profit on it, then that will be okay. They will 'kindly' let hi m off and the deal will be null and void. Nothing moves; it's just a paper tran saction. The non-Jew is the official owner of all that Passover forbids throughout his local Jewish community, but he sells it back for the same pric e when the festival is over. Th e buyer in the fi lm, Colin Day, said he had been doing this fo r 30 years. He said of Passover: 'Virtually in that time, I'm a millionaire'. But, alt hough he bought all the booty for a fe w pounds, he sells it back after eight days because he 'can't ma ke a profit'. How ridi culous it all is, and what a sham. Does Go d not know He is being conned here? Do they think 'He' is that stupid? At least Passover is only once a year; the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is every week. We saw a family rushing around and panicking as the Sabbath loomed at sunset on the Friday evening (although ther e is argument over whether th is is what 'God' meant). Rochel Jaffe said she had to have the ov en going the whole ti me because you can't cook on the Sabbath. Who says? Whoever wr ote the texts of the Old Testament thousands of years ago and no one knows th at. 'Once it starts getting close to the Sabbath it's music off, video off, computer off, ever ybody gets dressed and gets out and they know they have to move quick, you know', said Mrs Jaffe. She consulted the 'when it's the Sabbath' chart behind a cupboard door. '3.53, Sa bbath is 4.31 ... 31 and 7 is 38 minutes, 38 minutes, it sh ould be okay.' Let's hope so or goodness knows what God will do. St ill cooking when the sun goes down on a Friday? Condemn her! As soon as Sa bbath starts the father an d boys must head for the synagogue while the wife a nd girls say prayers at home. Rabbi Brodie said that turning on a light, an swering a phone or tu rning on a kettle is banned once Sabbath has begun. Rabbi Kaye returned at this st age. I'd missed him. He told us there are 'so many dos and so many don'ts ... can't put a light on [during] the Sabbath, mustn't make a fire ... Sabbath we are not allowed to burn a fire ... [so we] ... can't drive a car because y ou are burning combus tion'. As you'd expect with Rabbi Kaye, we were soon into serious detail: 'You should not burn a fire, but if a fire's burni ng ... I can let it continue burning. If you came to my house on a Saturday and saw me sitting in the dark and thought, \"Ah, the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"-fee Bod Ppospam 119 lights are off here, okay, I don't like you sitt ing in the dark,\" put the light on and walk out, I would have to leave the room because I am benefiting from something done for me on the Sabbath. 'But if I say, \"John, let's have a drink, only problem is the room's a bit dark,\" and you say \"Oh, I'll put the light on,\" and you sit down, the light's been put on for you. And when you leave the room, I say, \"John, do me a favour don't turn it off\", that's fine.' Whenever I need a way ar ound the system, Rabbi Kaye is my man. As he pointed out: 'Turning off something is sli ghtly different to turning something on'. You get the feeling that if the word 'n o' did not exist in the orthodox Jewish vocabulary they would all be permanently speechless. Mind, it's the same with all religions in the God Program and don't start me off about the Southern Baptists. One of the most bizarre of the Judaistic rituals is during the compulsory eight days of mourning that orthodox Jewish people must go through when a relative dies. They have to sit on a special lo w chair (reason never explained) and all mirrors must be covered (ditto). One poo r guy was visited by Rabbi Jaffe after the death of his sister to have his cardigan ha cked at with a knif e. This comes from the story of how Jacob reacted to the death of Joseph by tearing at his clothes. So, thousands of years later, Rabbi Jaffe pulle d out his blade and cut a hole in this man's jumper while exchanging 'holy words'. This is supposed to happen whenever a relative dies, much to the de light of clothing manu facturers. I must say also that whenever these guys said th eir 'holy prayers' there seemed to be a surprising lack of feeling and the words 'parrot' and 'fashion' came to mind. It was like hearing someone recite their two- times-table. The only ritual that looked like fun was called Purim, or Pour-in as it seemed to be. This is when Jews are told to relax and it is a m itzvah from God that the men mu st get pissed. It is what you might call a bar mitzvah. It was the only time in the series when the participants did not seem rushed and breat hless, panicking to fulfil the next law in the daily timetable. After all that had gone before it was nice to see them relaxed and happy, albeit not for long. An important part of the God Program softwa re is to force or pressure children to follow the parents' beliefs. An orthodox Jewish mother said she had friends who were worried sick that she had a daught er of 20 who wasn't yet married or betrothed. She said sh e wasn't worried herself (you go t the feeling she was) because God would find her daughter the right man. But even so she would make a few inquiries within the Jewish community. 'W e'll find someone', she said. We'll find someone? For me, it is nothing sort of abuse to manipulate or even, in many cases, insist that your so n or daughter marry someone who meets the approval of yourself and/or the laws of your religion. This ha ppens in a number of cultures and it's a bloody disgrace. The same mother told us that God doesn't like anyone who is full of themselves and the ego mu st be purged. They had to 'get rid of arrogance and haughtiness', she said. How this squared w ith pressurising children to get married and forcing them to follow your religion was never explained. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"120 Infinite Love is the Oniy Truth, Everything Else is Illusion Behind all this appare nt nonsense I have been describi ng in this chapter is control - control by fear. Rabbi 'Ch eese Danish' Furst summed it up as he continued with his 'What if?' theme: 'We apply this kind of thinking to everything we do - what if this can happen, what if that can happen because we are afraid. We are afraid of the spiritual damage that may come to us.' (My emphasis) He said food could affect a person's soul . If they ate food that had been made in the kosher way it had a positive spiritual affect on the soul - 'and God forbid if he should eat things that have been made in a way that violate strict kosher laws, it can have a negative effect on th e soul'. One of the kosher slaughterers who bleeds animals to death made the same claims: 'I f a person eats non-ko sher food it reduces his spirituality; if he sticks with kosher food it leaves his spiritua lity intact and in fact it grows because of the discipline behind having only kosher products. We believe this whole pack age of laws, as far as eating is concerned, elevates ... the soul to a higher spiritual level.' Utter bilge water. It cer tainly seems to do nothing for their health. Not one of thes e guys looked healthy. All this imposed behaviour is about the cosh not the kosher. It is to ma intain a state of dail y fear and servitude about the consequences of not doing as you are told. It is the God Program. As Rabbi Furst said: 'We have got to understand that in the world to come we are going to have to deal with this score card that we have developed over our life and ... the mistakes that we made we get punishment for them. However... if we fix up the mistakes we made in this world then we don't have to deal with it in the world to come.' What will the punishment be for mixing cheese w ith meat, one wonders? The eternal damnation of eating at McDonald's maybe. The ga me is simple. Get yourself a long list of laws you say were given by God, appoint a mafia priesthood to 'interpret' what God meant, and frighten th e followers shitless by telling them what will happen if they break G od's law. It's a cinch. I felt so sad for thes e guys in the Jewish Law series and those whom they th emselves control through fear. Rabbi Furst seemed a nice, jolly man to me, but there he was living every day in fear of the consequences of breaching laws written by who knows who th ousands of years ago. The Matrix has him by the Cheese Danish. Where is consciousness in all this? Where is Infinite Possibility? The Do Not Ask (DNA) religions, whic h you are told to follow wi thout question, are software programs and what I have just described is one of the more blatant examples. But there are many others. Christia ns are similarly told, or pr essured, what to think, do and say. Through the imposi tion of monumental tosh, th e Roman Church has held billions in the grip of terro r - control - throughout it s sorry existence. What a disgrace it is, this 'church' of hate and fe ar that claims merc handising rights to a 'loving God'. Then there ar e the sick minds at the lu natic extreme of the Muslim "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"121 faith in countries like Iran where, as Amnesty International has reported, even mentally ill teenaged girls face being flogged, ston ed to death or hanged for adultery, having sex before marriage and 'act s contrary to chastity'. This applies, it seems, even if these kids are forced into prostitution by their parents. The coldness and viciousness of these fa natics comes from the fact that they are software programs devoid of consciousness under th is book's definition. There are also the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims, and the grotesque caste system of the Hindus that selects a child's life opport unities by the family it is born into. These are different names for the sa me basic mindset and the ve ry fact they can give a name for what they believe means they have divided Oneness in their reality. If you can put a name to what you are or beli eve, the Matrix has you because names measure division not wholeness. These religions and so many more have one key thing in common: they are all bollocks. For readers from outside the Un ited Kingdom, the Br itish slang word 'bollocks' means both testicle s and utter nonsense, as in 'a load of bollocks'. In the context of religions I use the word in bot h definitions. Like I say, which religion you choose is not important to the Matrix, so lo ng as you fall in line with one of them because then the blinkers are on and the Matrix has you. What makes me smile is that they all think they ar e following a unique faith wh en they all come from the same blueprint, and they all have a need to wear uniforms. If you saw an orthodox Jew wouldn't you know immediately with th e beard, black hat a nd long black coat? Would you not know a Muslim immediately, or Sikh, or Buddhis t, or Christian priest? It's the herd menta lity made manifest. Another ho ok in the God Program is obedience to the founders of the faith. To Christians it's Je sus; to Jews it's Abraham or Moses; to Muslims it's Mohammed; to Sikhs it's Guru Nana k; to Buddhists it's Buddha; and to Hindus it's Kr ishna. I wonder if he was a Hairy Krishna? No, that would make him a Sikh. I can' t keep up with all this. I think I will start a new religion call ed Bollockism. I shall be the guru known as the Bollock (unlike with human males th ere cannot be two Bollocks) and my followers shall be known as Bollockists. We shall be distinct from all other religions in that we will shave the hair from our te sticles, and keep it in a plastic bag stuck to our chins. I shall create a women's version in which vaginal hair shall be considered sacred and must be worn under a turban. As you can imagine, it will be a celibate faith. The greatest movie about re ligion yet made wa s Monty Python's Life of Brian. It exposed it all for the bollocks that it is and I recall the scene wh ere Brian (symbol of Jesus) was running away from his followers and lost a sandal. One of the followers picked it up and shouted, 'It' s a sign, it's a sign'. They th en all took off a shoe in reverence to their master. What made the mo vie so funny was that it was true. Religion is one of thos e flytraps of the spirit in which, as with the Matrix itself, you can often only see the nonsense of it when you are looking from the outside. I have met many former Christians over the year s who have wondered why they couldn't see how crazy it all was when it later became so obvious to them. But then indoctrination and repetition are very powerful when your consciousness is on "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"122 vacation and letting the DNA program mi nd the shop. In the United States, Christian believers also domina te the conspiracy research field and this is why they only go so far in what they say, but no mo re. They are fine while their research supports their religious beliefs, but they won't cross the line, or even consider information, that would take them into le vels of understanding that undermine the validity of their faith. They think they are free from the manipulation because they know about the five-sense c onspiracy, but the Matrix s till has them through their religion and their belief in 'God Bless America'. One of the reasons that religions surv ive despite their non sense is a major manipulator of human reality that I call assumptions. I watched a documentary in which Christian academics had to adm it that they had little idea who was responsible for writing the Bible. They conceded that the contradictory Gospels were certainly not written by ey ewitnesses to the events th ey claim to describe and even the earlier Biblical te xts were rewritten by the Church to fit the political agenda of the time. But despite this demoliti on of what Christians are led to believe is the 'word of God', the acad emics said this had not dent ed their faith. One said the 'holy spirit' must have been working through those who wrote and rewrote the Bible, even though they made contra dictory statements (maybe 'God' was confused). The reason for this self-delusi on was the assumption that Jesus must have existed and that the foundati ons of the story must be true. This assumption holds the belief together no matter what reve lations may expose the religious deceit. Despite all the provable lies and contradicti ons in the official ve rsion of 9/11, most people assume that the basi c story must be correct and, therefore, they will never grasp what really happened. Assumptions edit reality beca use they are beliefs. As the Nazis used to say, the bigg er the lie the more it will be believed - assumed to be true. Albert Einstein made some belief-shattering scientific discoveries, but he was, himself, imprisoned by belief. He was one who proposed the quantum theory but, once he realised the implications of th is breakthrough for hi s assumptions about God, he spent the rest of his life trying (in vain) to dispro ve the findings of quantum physics. The perception of me among th ose programmed by media reports is constantly edited by preconceived assump tion. The media has portrayed me as crazy and those who believe su ch 'reports' filter whatever I say through that belief without hearing what is actually being sa id. Wiping the hard drive clean of all programmed assumptions is es sential because 99.9 per cent (at least) turn out to be flawed. The Bible, when portrayed as the actual word of God, is th e most destructive book on earth. The literal ra ther than symbolic inte rpretation, no matter how contradictory, leaves no room for independent thought or reappraisal in the light of new understanding. It is a sheep pen fo r the mind. There is no question, no discussion, no debate. The religion dictates wh at is and what isn't and that's all you need to know. The sight of soldiers pray ing to God and asking Jesus for support before battles of mass murder in Iraq reveals a level of contradiction, self-delusion and childlike naivety that beggars belief. I also cringe when I see sports people crossing their chests and as king Jesus to help them wi n. What has he got against "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"123 their opposition then? An England rugby ca ptain said when appointed that he had always believed this was what the Lord had planned for him. I am sure Jesus thought of nothi ng else. 'Say, Dad, we need a new England rugby capt ain, but leave it to me, I've got just the bloke.' And God saw that it was good. The depth of programming is such that even when faced with the illusory nature of reality the God Program can still prevail. I read an article on the Internet by a guy described as an 'intelligent Ch ristian'. I beg to differ if it 's all the same with you. He had experienced reality-altering drugs and sa w that the 'solid' wo rld is illusion. Ah, but there's a catch. God wants us to believe the illusion is real, he said. I quote:'... the \"perception\" is exactly what God wants us to see an d any attempt to get beyond this perception is so rcery'. This art was explicitly forbidden in the Bible again and again, he tells us. Quantum phys ics is sorcery, it seems, and part of Sata n's plan to enslave us. Plan? You mean that what we have now is freedom ? The spirit world was just as real as the physical and was accessible through various methods, this Christian chap continued, but to do so wa s unethical. 'The problem is, as usual, fallen man is pursuing knowledge on hi s own terms and, while gaining accurate data, is not subjecting the fi ndings to God's la w word.' He said the Bible confirmed that God did not want us to know the world is an illusion because it never mentions the fact. By this time I would have given anything fo r a conversation with Rabbi Furst about the dangers of molten cheese. Let me cut to this guy's chase: 'Everyone DOES know that God exists and that He is in charge. All unsaved humanity does seek to be free of what they see as his \"tyranny\". We are at a threshold in history. Never before have the techniques of \"breaki ng free\" - the techniques of sorcery, been so close to being presented to the general public. And the presentation is such that it bypasses all \"religious\" terminology.' Only to a victim of the God Program could breaking free be condemned as the work of the Devil. It is sobering to realise that no matter how much knowledge is put in front of people some are so utterly caught that th ey will go to any lengths to make it fit their religious belief. The Matrix created the 'gods' of the religions and in fact there is only one Matrix 'God' worshipped in different ways by the di fferent versions of the program (Figure 64, overleaf). The Red Dress bloodlines were once again used to found the religions and fast asleep cons ciousness has been trapped in the web. The Illuminati families have played a predominant role in the cr eation of the major theological and fiscal religions, everything from Christianity and Judaism to th e New Age and the worship of money. I outlined earlier, and have de tailed at length in othe r books, how the Illuminati were heavily centred in an cient Babylon and then relocated to Ro me. This is why the Roman Church, which became the founda tion of Christianity in all its later forms, is the Church of Ba bylon under another name.

The Babylonian symbolism has been continued both in th e religions they founded and th e symbols and architecture of our cities. Nimrod was also symbolised in Babylon as the Fish God, Oannes, and in Figures 65 and 66 you can se e the ancient depiction of Oannes/Nimr od alongside the Pope with the mitre on his head. Noti ce any similarities?? Roman Catholicism venerates Mary, the virgin 'Mother of Jesu s' and 'Queen of Heaven', in the same way that the Babylonians did with Semirami s, the virgin 'Mother of Tammuz', and 'Queen of Heaven', and the Egyptians did with Isis, the virgin 'Mother of Horus' and 'Queen of Heaven' (Figures 67, 68 and 69, overleaf). Semiramis was said to have been 'immaculately conceived' by 'God' - the rays of the S un God, Nimrod, also known as Baal. The 'virgin-born sons', Jesus and Horus, were both connected to the symbol of the fish, as was Nimrod. The Gospel stories, on which 'Jesus' an d Christianity were founded, are a mass of Eg yptian/Sumerian/Babylonian mystery school symbolism relating to sun worship, secret rituals and other esoteric concepts, as I detail in The Biggest Secret and Children of the Matrix. The same basic story of 'born on December 25th, died to save humanit y, etc., was widely told thousands of years before Christianity about th e exploits of the sun gods in many and various cultures, including Rome (Mith ra) and Babylon (Tammuz - the 'son of the Sun God'). The halos used in pictures of the Gospel hero es are inspired by the way the ancients portrayed their sun gods with halos to symbolise what they represented - the sun.

First the Illuminati Anti-Def amation League (which spends it's time defaming people) said the movie was 'anti- Semitic', but from wh at I see there is very little in the ADL's juven ile mind that is not consid ered so. Next we had the New Black Panther Party in America condem ning the film for po rtraying Jesus as white when they said he mu st have been black. The ADL said the movie was racist for blaming Jews for the death of Jesus and the New Black Panthers said it was racist for misrepresenting the way he must have looked. Over here a second guys, get this: there was no Jesus - black, white or pink with blue st ripes! You are all arguing over someone who didn't exist. The Jesus myth was sold to the black slaves by their captors as a means of control and no w we have the pathet ic sight of the so- called most powerful country in the world dominated by a belief in a religion based on the worship of a no n-existent man. Unless a would- be president pr ofesses a deep belief in this myth he has no chance of be ing elected to office. I can hear the Matrix laughing from here. In Babylon, Queen Semiramis proclaimed that Nimrod/Baal would be present on earth in the form of a flame, and that is the origin of the Illuminati symbol of the flame or lighted torch held by the Stat ue of Liberty - a portrayal of Queen Semiramis given to New York by French Freemasons in Paris, where they have a mirror version on an island in the River Seine (Figur es 70, 71 and 72). Queen Semiramis also became the British goddess deity, Britannia (Figure 73). When Tammuz died, Semiramis said that he had 'a scended to his father ', the sun or Baal, and would also be worshipped as a flame. The 'Christian' festiv al of Easter comes from the same source. Easter originates from the Babyloni an goddess, Ishtar, (Semiramis again) and it celebrated her son, Tammuz, who was the 'only begotten son of the Moon Goddess and Sun God' - Nimrod an d Semiramis.

Note also how the Babylonian Semiramis is holding the 'Christian' cross thousands of years before Christianity (Ishtar) eggs and the 'Eas ter bunny' also come from Babylon. Queen Semiramis said she came from the moon in a giant eg g and this became known as the Ishtar egg. Tammuz was said to be very fond of rabbits and so we have the Easter bunny. They also ate 'sacred cakes' with a 'T ' on the top - the origin of our hot cross buns. The 'T' is a major symbol of Freemasonry partly because of its associations with Babylon and Tammuz. The Christian wafer used in Catholic ceremoni es comes from the Egyptian ta-en- aah, the sacrific ial bread of the moon. Christians think the bread symbolises the 'body of Jesus' when they are really involved in a ritual about an Egyptian moon deity! Judaism in its Biblical form was also fundamentally influe nced by Babylon. In 587 BC , the Babylonian army of Ki ng Nebuchadnezzar ove rran Judea and took most, though not all, of the people into captiv ity in Babylon. This was a melting pot of peoples and bloodlines, and a centre for what we would call satanic ritual and black magic. The Judeans were captive in the sense that they couldn't leave, but they were allowed to go about their business and came into contact with the religious stories and myths from Babylon and the earlier Sumer in the la nd also known as Chaldea, Mesopotamia and today, Iraq. It was afte r the 70-year captivity that the Levite priesthood and others mixed ancient writin gs with the Babyloni an influences to produce the Torah (the law) - the first five books of the Old Testament also known as the Pentateuch, which are officially attributed to 'M oses'. This was hundreds of years after the events were supposed to have taken place. Babylon was also the inspiration for th e rabbinic teachings known as th e Babylonian Talmud, a massive influence on Jewish belief and deeply racist. Whenever they wanted the people to 127"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"128 do something they wrote that 'God' had commanded it and thousands of years later orthodox Jewish people are st ill agonising over their Chee se Danish and hacking at their beards with blunt scissors to make sure they conform. The Levites and company took Sumerian and Babylonian stor ies and transferred them to their own, often made-up, char acters. One was the tale of how the Mesopotamian King Sargon was found as a baby floating in bulrushes on the River Euphrates by 'Akki the irrigator' and he wa s brought up to serve as gardener in the palace of Kish. The story went that th e goddess Ishtar favoured Sargon and he eventually became king and emperor. The Levites and their cohor ts changed Sargon to Moses in their version of the same basi c story. They also introduced the character of St Michael, the Sumerian Tas Mi-ki- gal, the dragon-slayer and Lord of Agriculture. He was later call ed Lord of the Air and give n wings to fly. There were no angels in Israelite belief until the Ba bylon captivity. The Gr eat Flood of 'Noah' was also a steal from the far older Sume rian/Babylonia n account of Gilgamesh. As with Christianity, Babylonian holy days we re turned into 'Jewish' holy days. The Levites relocated Sumerian, Babylonian and Egyptian st ories and themes to the land they called Israel. Th e high initiates have alwa ys understood the coded meanings, but the mass of the people have be en sold a lie, a cover story, to imprison their minds and make them slaves to th eir hierarchy. Even circumcision, so fundamentally associated with the Jewish faith, came fr om Egypt. You can see the common Babylonian origin for the Jewish and Christian re ligions in th e beliefs and methods of Judaism and the Roman Catholic Church. Both terrify their victims into conforming to 'God's la w' by the fear of what will happ en in the next world if they don't obey the priests an d the Bible in this one. I also see that some Sikh writers highli ght the Old Testament story of Samson to support the belief that cutting your hair weakens you. But the myth of Samson is a symbolic story relating to su n worship, not follicle power . The ancients symbolised the earth's journey around the sun as the life cycle of a man. He would be born or reborn on what is our Decemb er 25th, three days after the winter solstice when they said the sun had 'died' or reached the lowest point of its power in the northern hemisphere. The 'man' would r each the peak of his strength at the summer solstice when he would be depict ed with long golden hair, symbolising the powerful rays of the sun at that time of year. When he bega n to grow older and lose his strength as he entered the autum n, or fall (the astrological house of Virgo the Virgin, the 'House of Delilah'), he would be portrayed with shorter hair reflecting the failing power of the rays. Samson is Sam-sun, just as every syllable of Sol-om-on is a word meaning the sun. Jesu s was also a symbol of the sun and not the literal man of the Gospels. I expand on this at length in other books and it is no coincidence that, according to the Bible, it was three days after Jesus died that he was 'resurrected' - just as they said a bout the sun between the winter solstice and what became our December 25th. Islam also includes many elements of th e Babylonian-inspired Christianity and Judaism in its belief system and accepts the literal existence of Jesus and the 'father of the Jews', Abraham, whom it calls Ibrahim. Muslims believe that"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"129 Abraham/Ibrahim was a prophet carrying the same message from God as the later Muhammad. Abraham is claimed to have erected the Ka'ba, the most holy place in the Islamic world at Mecca. Most of the stories ab out Abraham in the Islamic tradition come from sources othe r than the Koran and there are many parallels to the life of Moses. Muslims also believe that Abraham circumcised himself at the age of 120 and that he died at the age of 175. On the day of resurrection they say that Abraham will sit to the left of God and lead believers into Paradise. What we have here, and they are not alone, are religions created and designed to imprison consciousness in the Matrix by selli ng the same basic belief package: those that believe in the re ligion and do as it demands will have a one-way ticket to Paradise as the chosen ones of 'God'. Jews claim to be the chosen people; Christians sa y that only by believing in Jesus will we go to heaven; and Muslims say that only those who fo llow the Allah version of 'God' will you book a seat on the cloud. It is the Go d Program - Matrix software for the imprisonment of hum an consciousness. Only the details appear different to give the illusion of religious choice and create the fault lines throu gh which the desired conflict between beliefs can be orchestrated. What strikes me about religions is not thei r differences, most of which are irrelevant detail, but their similarities. They are the same in the way they coerce and bully their follow ers; they overwhelmingly have the same origin; and even the uniforms are often similar. Jews, Muslims and the Roman Catholic Pope all wear the skullcap. If the Pope had a beard he wo uld have the set. Th e priests of Babylon shaved their heads in a circle at the crow n, known as a tonsure, to signify their allegiance to the sun god and this was continued by the Roman Catholic clergy because it was the Church of Babylon relocated. Some tr ibes in Africa and some South American Indians shave their heads in the same way. The skullcap (called the kippa or kippah by Jews) is symbolic of the commitment to the sun god - the religion of Babylon and Chaldea. Alexander Hislop writes in The Two Babylons (Chick Publications, reprint edition, 1998): 'Over all the world, where the traces of the Chaldean system are found, this tonsure or shaving of the head, is always found along with it. The priests of Osiris, the Egyptian Bacchus, were always distinguished by the shaving of their heads. In Pagan Rome, in India, and even in China, the distinguishing mark of the Babylonian priesthood was the shaven head. Thus Gautama Buddha, who lived at least 540 years before Christ, when setting up the sect of Buddhism in India whic h spread to the remotest regions of the East, first shaved his own head, in obedience, as he pretended, to a Divine command, and then set to work to get others to imitate his example.' The Sikh and Hindu turban can be found in ancient Babylon and the western traditions that came from th ere. Ezekiel 23:15 in the Old Testament says that'... with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chario t officers, natives of Chal dea'. Ezekiel 44:18 orders that 'they are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"130 around their waists'. I didn't realise how many times the turban gets a mention in the Bible, the book quoted by far more relig ions than Judaism and Christianity to support their beliefs and impositions. Major world religions are the offspring of Babylon. The gods of religious extremism are a Matrix program design ed to be the blinkers that block peripheral vision. Wh at the Matrix needs for its vibratory illusions are polarities, the two points betw een which a frequenc y can resonate; so Left is as important as Right to the Ma trix because one cann ot exist without the other and Christianity is as important as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism - any of them. You will also notice how the or iginal religion is divided into a mass of competing, often warring, factions. We ha ve Protestant Christians and Roman Catholic Christians and the Protestant faith is itself a mass of competing subgroups. Jewish beliefs present the impr ession of being united when there are many different groupi ngs in competition. Islam has its Sunni and Shiite factions divided by conflict over the so-called caliph s, the alleged successors to the Prophet Mohammed. Here is an explanation of th is conflict. Please read slowly and concentrate: 'There are a number of differences in the Shi'ah (Shiite) and the Sunni Juristic opinions. However, not all these difference s can be termed as the \"basic differences\" in these two major sects of Islam. The basic difference in the two sects is that of the Shiite faith of the system of \"Imamah\". The Shiite faith of \"Imamah\" implies that after the Prophet (pbuh), there shall be no other prophet but, the only true leader of the Muslims, at any given time, is an \"Imam\" w ho, like the prophets of God, is directly appointed by God. The appointment of the first \"imam\" was made by God through the last Prophet (pbuh), while every subsequent \"imam\" is appointed through the \"imam,\" who precedes him. Another qualification of the \"imam,\" according to the Shiite belief is that he shall belong to the family of t he last Prophet (pbuh). The Shiite belief holds that the \"Imams,\" like the prophets of G od, are \"ma'soom\" (sinless, innocent) and, therefore, should be obeyed in all matters and under all circumstances. The \"Imams,\" according to the Shiite faith, are thus not just the political leaders of the Muslims but also their religious leaders and clergy. T he Sunni school, on the other hand, does not ascribe to any such belief.' 3 Okay, have you got that or do you need a bit longer? So that's why they have spent so long fighting and ki lling each other. If children acted like the religious fanatics you would tell them to grow up. What insanity it all is. We are Infinite Consciousness so why do we need some prie st, caliph or rabbi to tell us what to think and how to live our lives? It is spel lbindingly ridiculous and everyone suffers the consequences of these schoolboy squa bbles with the global disharmony they create. But conflict and division is what the Matrix desires and religions always deliver because so many of their advocat es have lost the power of independent thought and discernment if, indeed, they ever had it. If you are awake enough to reject conv entional religion, th e Matrix has other options. You can worship the gods of money, 'sta tus', and power over others. These"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"131 obsessions are religions unde r other names and also di ctate what you must do, think and say to achieve your go al. 'I must be what the boss wants me to be so I can get the foreman's job'; 'I must do what the Prime Minister wants me to do so he will make me a lord'; 'I must trample over pe ople and ignore the consequences of my actions for others so I can make as much money as possible'. These religions also have a uniform - the shirt and tie. What is it with that? They say people have to go to work 'properly dressed' in shirt and tie and even schoolchildren often get the same treatment. Who decided th at shirt and tie = properly dressed? It wasn't me, was it you? No? Then who and why? I was watching the television news when Tony Blair was making a speech about Iraq dre ssed in a shirt, tie and suit. He handed over to the interim Prime Minister of Ira q, the CIA and British intelligence asset, Ayad Allawi, a 'Muslim' who wa s also wearing a shirt, tie and suit. They then cut to the political correspondent (shirt, tie and suit) who handed back to the newsreader (shirt, tie and suit). How wa s the communication of that 'news' made any more effective because everyone was wearing the same un iform? Were the horrors inflicted on Iraq by Bush and Blair mitigated and made less abhorrent because they made the order to invade while wearing a shirt, tie and suit? Once again, it's all nonsense. The shirt and tie has the same origin as all other religions and their uniforms, the ancient secret mystery schools in Ba bylon and elsewhere. It comes from a ceremony still performed today by the Sc ottish Rite of Freemasonry (another Babylon religion) in which the initiate has a noose, known as the cable tow, placed around his neck while blindfolded or 'hoodwinked', as it is called, and he is pulled along by the rope in the ritual. The tie, as in shirt and tie, is a noose. The initiates of the shirt and tie religions have a noose around their necks while being blindfolded by the Matrix, and how appropr iate that the 'proper attire' for the 'professional classes', and Christian men a ttending church, is a shirt and tie. Even music comes with a uniform while claiming to be different. If you saw a rap singer (back-to-front baseball cap) or punk rocker (designer-dishevelled) wouldn't you know what they were before they play ed a chord? The official religions and those that worship money, power and celebr ity are essentially the same. Only the name of the god is different. For Chris tians He's the Almighty; for Jews He's Yahweh; for Muslims He's Alla h; for the shirt and tie religions He's status, title or bank balance; and for the celebrity religions He is the latest hyped flavour of the moment. All are expressions of the God Program and all have the same aim: human control. There is one other point to make about religions in all their forms. They encourage or impose rigid beliefs and thes e stem the flow of energy through the DNA network and suppress (make correspondingly dense and rigid) the resonance of the human hologram. This locks people deeper into the low frequencies of the Ma trix program. American psychi atrist, David Shainberg, from the William Alanson White In stitute of Psychiatry in New York, believes that thoughts are vortices that can become fi xed and rigid. He suggests that these manifest themselves as fixed opinions , unchanging views and a rigid sense of"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"132 reality that is resistant to change.

It is called the 'New Age'. Ironically, the New Age, in all its forms, is significantly more enlightened than conventional religion and hum anist thought. It understands that this world is only one of infinite dimensions of existence and all is but a different vibration within an infinite whole. It speaks of Oneness a nd knows that it is pos sible to communicate between vibratory realms. I agree with th e basic theme and there are many genuine and intelligent people who accept and articulate its beliefs. But what makes the New Age such an effective last line of defence for th e Matrix is the very fact that it is more aware than atheism and conve ntional religion. Those who expand their consciousness to see through the absurd ity of current human exis tence and the mainstream explanations for 'life', are in danger of sussing the virtual-reality game they are caught in. The Matrix needs a trap to ensnare them before the final pennies drop and the New Age is it. Put another way, it is th e last cul-de-sac before the gold mine. A key control system is the way the New Age and Spiritualism portray the divisions between this 'physical' realm and what they call the 'spirit world'. Even most of those who accept the existence of the Matrix would perc eive it to be the reality we are now experiencing with the sp irit world beyond it. Therefore, much of what is communicated through spiritualis t mediums and New Age 'channels' is considered more enlightened than our rea lity and thus to be encompassed, believed or acted upon. We might hear lines like 't est the spirits', but the conscious and subconscious themes are that the 'other si de' must know best. On one level this can have validity because they know by the very fact they ar e communicating with this realm from another one that there are many 'worlds' of existenc e. But while they may have that knowledge, the overwhelmi ng majority of thes e communicators are also caught in the Matrix. It is a multi-dim ensional system with different software programs for different levels of awarenes s. The Matrix is empowered by the energy generated by imprisoned consciousness, not only here, but in other dimensions of itself. 133 I"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"134 I wrote earlier about the interspaces where the Re ptilians, the manipulating ones, anyway, appear to reside and the New Age talks about th e realms of deep malevolence that it calls the lower astr al. These realms are Matrix energy generators, too, under the co ntrol of other software. The game may be a little different, but the aim is the same. 'Death' in this world and the transition to another level of the Matrix is like swapping Supe r Mario for the Sims on the same computer or moving between strands in the same we b. This is one fundamental reason why we 'forget' where we 've come from when we are born into the Time Loop. We enter a different program and unplug from the last one. Only through our Infinite Consciousness can we remember who we really are. Any realm in our current expe rience that takes form, vibrates or has rules, is a program of the Matrix . New Age thought describes th e different bodies that we have in different dimensions. We have a 'physical' body in th is world, but in the astral realms we have an astral body th at resonates to the frequency of that dimension and so on. I agree with this, but these di fferent holographic bodies relate to different software programs within the Matrix and they are illusions. The program is delivered to us through the DNA receiver/transmitters and these other 'bodies' within the Matrix have their ve rsion of DNA which, when you go beyond the hologram, is a frequency field or waveform. Only when we become pure consciousness in awareness of itself can we ditch the bodies and with them the Matrix. Communicators from these other realms of the virtual-reality game speak of living in a place that vibrates quicker than this world and so we cannot see it from our density. Again, I have no problem with that. But the crucial word there is vibrates. As the voice in Brazil said: 'If it vi brates, it's illusion'. What I experienced in what I was told was a state of Oneness be yond the Matrix did not vibrate. It was still or, at most, a slow-motion wave here and there. Everything just was and there were no rules. This is a critical poin t. If there are rule s, it's the Matrix. The voice said, for example, that there we re no laws of physics, only scientists using illusory Ta ws' to measure an illuso ry universe. They were merely 'laws' that we believed in. There were no laws of any kind because everything just was. 'Do you think the Infinite needs \"laws\" thro ugh which to express itself?' the voice asked. The 'law' of gravity, like all the others, is just part of the software that can be overcome by consciousn ess that can disconnect itself from the program. This is what so-called miracles are - the ability to override the program and so override the illusory laws and limitati ons of the program. Rules are the illusion of DNA mind, not the creation of Infinite Consciousness. This worl d is drowning under rules because it is the densest part of the Matrix, but rules op erate throughout the multi- dimensional system. Some scie ntists say that the different parallel univ erses they've identified have differe nt laws of physics. But how can th is be? Surely if the laws are real the same ones should apply everywhere? The reason they don't is because the different 'universes' are different software programs that operate with different manufactured rules. Communicators from ot her dimensions also tell of rules, like they can't help anyone in th is world unless the person asks them. That's a Matrix program. Outside the Matr ix there are no rules. Th is point is well made by "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"135 Morpheus in this conversation with Ne o ('the One') in the first Matrix movie: 'I've seen an agent [software program] pu nch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on ru les. Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.' 'What are you trying to tell me, that I can dodge bullets?' 'No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.' The Matrix controls us because we play by its rules and the biggest mistake is to believe that there are any. It has been shown that the beliefs of the scientists performing an experiment will affect the outcome becaus e belief creates reality and laws are only what we believe them to be . Remember, the 'world' the scientists are exploring only exists in their heads, too. They are seeking to dissect and label an illusion while thinki ng it's real! The DNA programmi ng is selling us the reality of 'laws', but our consciousness is more than powerful enough to overcome that. The New Age, as a Matrix phenom enon, is full of rules, as are the Eastern philosophies on which it is based. You have to do this ritual or that ritual, speak to the spirits in a certain way, or protect yo urself with a mantra. I ha ve seen New Age advocates speak to the earth by looking in turn to north, south, east and we st. They have their sacred trees, swords, rods or staffs and their awe of these symbols matches anything you will fi nd in conventional religions. Yet all this is just more illusion. The earth has consciousness, but its physical form is a software prog ram; so is nort h, south, east and west, and the othe r planets and stars. Why are we in awe of a cosmic Game Boy? It's just a trap. I am not saying that ever ything the New Age proclaims is mistaken, not at all. But what it perceives to be outside of the system of control is not. Take astrology, a major New Age tool. In the right hands, it can be extremely accurate and sometimes very useful in a 'this world' sense. Th e movement of the pl anets and stars is a Matrix program, a holographic version of the one projected on the ceiling of a planetarium. These planetar y movements trigger vibrational changes that affect humans and other life on earth because it affects the DNA and the input/output system. The point at which we enter the Time Loop also impacts the DNA. Astrology is the interaction between the vi brational fields created by the celestial cycles and our DNA program is affected by where in the cycle we are 'born'. But I stress that this interaction is not be tween our consciousne ss and the planetary movements; it is between the planets and our DNA, wh ich includes the mind and emotions. At this level, astrology in its deep er and detailed form is certainly relevant, but when we move our awareness beyond mi nd to the consciousn ess of the 'One', we cease to be affected by the astrological Taws'. What is referred to as 'Fate' is not the in evitable experience of consciousness; it is the inevitable outcome of the DNA computer prog ram unless consciousness"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"136 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is illusion intervenes. Fate is Matrix software. Oneness doesn't do fa te. There is no such thing as a done deal within All Possibility. The voice in Brazil said that astrology was another Matrix tool to en force the illusion about the pr ogression of time and to encourage people to identify with their illusory 'pers onality' - 1 am a Taurus, Leo, Capricorn or whatever. It emphasised the di vision of parts, no t the whole. 'Do you think the Infinite has its astrology read?' asked the voice. 'Do you think it consults a psychic about its \"future\" or visits a ta rot card reader?' As I was hearing these words, I was shown a symbolic scene of the Infinite sitting at a table when someone brought the morning paper. The Infinite turned to the list of birth signs on the astrology page and said: 'Oh, my goodness, this will take me all morning because I am all of them'. This doesn't mean that gifted psychics and ta rot card readers do not have a role to play, only that we need to understand that, with ra re exceptions, they are communicating with entities and energies within the Matr ix that are also caught in illusory reality. The most profound delusion of New Age thought in my view is the idea that we are 'evolving' though our experi ence. I can see how it looks that way, but this is the spiritual version of the theory of evolution attri buted quite wrongly to Charles Darwin (see And The Truth Shall Set You Free ). While the 'Darwin' theory speaks of the survival of the fittest and genetic change triggered by necessity over aeons, so the New Age believes in a cycle of repeating experience in this world called reincarnation, through whic h we spiritually evolve over the vastness of time. The idea is that we move between the physical earth and the 'spiritual' realms experiencing every life possi bility. In doing so, it is sa id, we learn and evolve spiritually to reach higher vibrations a nd eventually merge wi th the One. But we are already Infinite Oneness and All Possi bility. Why do we need to evolve into something we already are? Th is belief is a crucial mean s through whic h the Matrix maintains its grip on our re ality, not only in the Time Lo op, but in its non-'physical' levels too. We don't have to evolve to enlightenment , we are enlightened ; we have simply forgotten because we are caught in the illusion. 'Do you think the Infinite has to reincarnate?' the voice said to me. 'Consciousness in the Matrix is also the Infinite, so why does that have to reincarnate?' I hear people say they have learned from experience and I understand th at. But I would put it another way. The experience has not taught them anything, merely re moved a layer of the veil so they can remember more easily what they already k now. I have no problem with the idea of reincarnation, although I think there is a lo t more to understand about it. I'm sure it's correct that consciousn ess is caught in a cycle of moving between the other levels of the Matrix and di fferent parts of the software program or Time Loop DVD. It is not this that I challenge, but the belie f that it is necessary to find enlightenment. I would say the opposite is the case b ecause reincarnation reinforces the 'we must evolve' reality the Matr ix seeks to pedal. This ke eps consciousness enslaved through the beli ef that it is getting somewhere. As the voice spoke in Brazil, I was shown a picture of people symbolically dropping from the sk y onto a footpath across a field. The voice said that because consciousness in th e Matrix was caught in "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"137 a cycle of moving in and out of the Ti me Loop through reincarnation, people were not only conditioned by th e beliefs of one 'physica l' lifetime - they were conditioned by endless experi ences in the Time Loop (di fferent parts of the DVD). Between these 'physical' excursions they we re in another form of illusory state. They were already conditioned even as they entered the Time L oop reality for still more conditioning. This wa s why humans dropped into the conditioned, servile mentality so easily; they had been there many times before. When these words were being spoken, I saw the foot path being worn away by th e trampling feet going over the same ground until the path looked like a sort of record groove. It got deeper and deeper and the figures walk ing the path went further and further down until they disappeared. 'Is it any wonder that human s look up for their Go d?' the voice said. It is the only place wh ere they can see any li ght!' Advocates of the reincarnation/karma cycle might also ponde r on how much 'past-life' memory is actually the program carried in the DNA and not the recall of incarnate consciousness. The point about continuing in an illusory state even afte r what we call death is extremely important, not least because thes e other levels provide the sources for most (though not all) of the psychic and channelled informat ion of the New Age and Spiritualism. That is not to say that some of th is is not worthwhile and valid, but we need to understand that the comm unicators are in the Matrix too. These other realms could be even more open to illusion becaus e they operate on a higher vibration with far less density. Compared wi th the treacle-like density of the Time Loop, it must indeed seem like Heaven. The voice in Brazil, and at other times since, described how other levels of the Ma trix include a Christian 'heaven', Islamic 'heaven', Hindu 'heaven' and Jewish 'heaven', etc. These weren't 'real'; they were the manifestation of belief in the same way that we create our reality in this world. They are software programs of the mind which sell us th at reality, but we don't have to buy them. If Christians believe deeply that they will see Jesus wh en they 'die ', then they will. They will edit reality in line with the belief in that reality. Wh at's more they will see the version of Jesus that European artists invented becau se that has become their belief of what he l ooked like. I have met many ps ychics over the years who have told of their experiences with Christians who have died, especially Roman Catholics, who are stuck in some in-between realm, maybe an interspace, waiting to be judged by God because that is what they believed would happen. The illusion doesn't end at 'death' because the Matrix is multi-levelle d. I love the line 'death is no cure for ignorance', becaus e it's so spot on. At what we call death, 'incarnate' consciousness is drawn by the principle of sympathetic resonanc e to realms that vibrationally mirror its own state. Put si mply: what you believe when you 'leave' decides where you 'go'. But wh erever you 'go' within the Matrix, it's still illusion. We need to break the cycle of programme d belief and open ourselves to Infinite Consciousness. If people lik e Rabbi Furst believe in puni shment in the next world for actions in this one, that is what their consciousness will create. It ain't true, unless you believe it is.

It is another version of the 'we must evolve th rough experience' scam. We are the One, all enlightened, all consciousness, all knowing, no schools necessary. New Age thought also believes that the earth is a spiritual 'university' where people learn tough lessons and work out th eir 'karma'. This was illusion, the voice in Brazil said. 'Do you think the Infinite has to go to school to learn anything when it knows everything there is to know?' As for karma, the idea that you experience what you have made others experience, the voice as ked: 'Why should the Infinite have to experience what it has made it self experience?' The idea of karma is a Matrix myth to confirm a belief in evolut ion over 'time' an d encourage a state of guilt and self- loathing. 'Infinite Love does not judge itself or loathe itself - th ese are illusions of disconnection', the voice said. While I was pondering all this I had a picture in my mind of the Matrix as a snakes and ladders game. Consciousness thought it was progressing up the vibratory levels toward s 'God', when at some point it would stand on a snake and come sliding down to begin all over again (Figure 74). The Matrix is a system that wants to entrap more consciousness, not free that which is already caught in the net. When you observe the New Age you see constant parallels with the conventional religions th at it claims to reject. It ta lks a good story abou t the need to express your own power and not give it aw ay to others, but it is, in blatant contradiction, awash with hi erarchy. There are endless 'spi ritual masters' in this world and others. As mainstream religions hand their minds to gods and priests, so the New Age bows its head to masters, gurus and other-dimensional communicators. There is the so-called 'Great White Brot herhood' and th e fleets of alleged UFOs headed by 'Ashtar Command' who communicate 'enlightenment' to their advocates. This is just more tosh to fuck with our heads. The Great White Brotherhood (also known as The White Lodge/The Brotherhood/The Brotherhood of Light) is claimed to be a spiritual organi sation composed of those 'Ascended Masters' who have 'arisen from our earth into Immortality'. They could have gone to the 'Cosmic Heights, leaving our brot hers and sisters on earth behind', but instead they said they would 'stay and assist'. 1 It is said that they have 'transcended the cycles of karma and rebirth and ascende d into that Higher Reality which is the eternal abode of the soul'. This Brotherhood, I learn, has been 'sponsoring the release of the spoken word through conclaves, seminars, writings, bo oks, and through pe rsonal discipleship and training'. They are also releasing the 'full teachings that the Dispensations of Cosmic Law allow at the dawning of the Great Golden Age of Saint Germain [a member of the Brotherhood]'. Here yer go. We must have our 'Cosmic Law' because this is the Matrix. And wh y does this Saint Germain guy have to copyright and trademark this golden period? Isn't it s upposed to be for everyone?

I have seen it suggested that the 'goblins', 'pix ies', 'fairies', and T ittle people' of folklore manifest today as what we call ETs. This could well be tr ue because the Matrix will provide the software that compliments the part of the 'DVD' that is being experienced. At the point in the movie we call sa y 1306, the 'ETs' might take a form that fits with that era, while in the computerised, so-called hi -tech world of the 21st century they take the appearance of sci-fi space beings. Or, in the case of Ashtar Command, they are only a fairytale that th eir followers believe. I put Ashtar Command into Internet s earch and found more than 17,000 pages including pictures of 'him' (Figures 77 a nd 78, overleaf). The belief is that this extraterrestrial cavalry is co ming to save the day. It is the same program that stars Jesus in the Christian versi on and the Messiah in the Jewi sh edition. We even have the same theme of the 'chosen ones' in that Ashtar followers have told me how they are going to be taken from the planet, 'tur ned into fifth dimensional beings', and brought back to teach humanity. One website provided a message from 'Commander Starene of the 7th Fleet in th e Ashtar Command'. A pparently her ship, the Rainbow Light, has been 'called into our solar system to aid in the balancing of the Harmonics for our Planet Earth!' Hey, let's party. She was doing this from the Venusian system by sending love on puls ar waves and working with the other ships in the command to 'send the Harmonic Rays directly to the affected areas that are causing the disharmony! ' Sounds like a cosmic h aemorrhoid cream. All anal retentives should apply Harmonic Rays to the affected areas. The 'message' was peppered with exclamation marks, a symbol of the naive overexcitement that you find in many areas of th e New Age. Commander Star ene was working with the geometries and all ships were planning st rategies to work w ith the leaders and countries to find solutions! I hope this includes a solution to the problem of people believing this trash. The ships were on standby as always, the message continued, and were ready for any mishaps if there were 'going to be any ascended beings "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" leaving this planet!' (See chosen ones whip ped off to the fifth di mension and all that stuff.) Commander Starene said that all was being looked after and watched over. 'All members of the command ar e very busy doing their jobs as we are in spirit and in our spirit bodies or lightbodies!!!' Th e message concluded: Dear Beloved Ones, I, Starene, send you the Most Golden Rose LOVE vibrations to each and every one of YOU! We are so glad that you are listening and connecting with us! Be at PEACE within as without... Be at LOVE ...!!! We ALL LOVE YOU!!!!!! Adonai! Kadoish, Kadoish, Kadoish, Adonai, Tsebayoth!!!! Loves & Lights! ShaLaeLa! i.e. Cdr. Starene, 7th Fleet Ashtar Command It is the saviour-me ssiah theme in anothe r guise, a different version of the God Program and, as with all of them, whenever it is predicted the saviour will come, in this case Ashtar Command, ther e is always a reason why it has to be delayed. I find it interesting that the major Illuminati goddess in Babylon, Queen 'Statue of Liberty Semiramis, was also known as Ishtar or ... Ashtar. I think we have another coincidence going here. They ar e taking the piss. You'd e xpect Jesus to be involved 142"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"143 somewhere and, of course, he is. Asht ar Command is an 'etheric group of extraterrestrials, angels and lightbeings and millions of \"sta rships\" working as coordinators of the activities of the spac efleet over the wester n hemisphere', all under the 'spiritual guidan ce of Sananda (the Most Ra diant One), the ascended master who walked the earth incarnated as Jesus the Christ'. You know the guy, also called Tammuz, Mithra and Dionysus , among endless other al iases. One Ashtar website carried Christmas greetings from Mother Mary, another of the New Age-Christian crossovers in the God Program. Ashtar himself, the commander of the galactic fleet and representa tive for the Universal Counci l of the Confederation of Planets is, I understand, currently engaged in earth's ascension-process. I am most relieved. This is the deal: 'There are 144,000 light workers called Eagl es connected to the Command and that is the minimum of souls required for the ascension process. These Eagles are a group of souls who don't identify with a special planet. They know they are one with all, and that they are Christ (fundamental to any discussion of New Age Christology is the recognition that New Agers distinguish between Jesus, a mere human vessel, and the Christ consciousness variously defined, but always divine, and often a cosmic, impersonal entity). They serve like cosmic midwives in the ascension process; the birthing of humanity from dense-physical into physical-etheric bodies of Light, capable of ascending with the earth into the fifth dimension. Li ght work is incorporating Jesus's message of Love and Light into our daily lives, ultimately connecting with our Higher Self.' 3 A lady once told me that she was one of the 144,00 0 and I asked her how she knew. She said she had atte nded a workshop in Glasto nbury (a Britis h version of Sedona, Arizona) and the host had told he r the good news. The ho st had also had a vision of her as a goddess wa lking down stone steps in A tlantis. A few months later another woman mentione d that she was one of the 144,000. 1 as ked her if she had been to a workshop in Gl astonbury where the lady ha d a vision of her walking down steps as a goddess in Atlantis. 'How did you know?' came the reply. I also read that Jesus (as Sananda) and Lady Nada (never did work out who she was) both work with the 'sixth ray' to heal fana ticism and to raise th e focus of devotional worship. And that's the point, really. All these Matrix programs advocate forms of 'devotional worship'. But we are Onenes s, so on whom are we projecting such worship? The Matrix wants us to find so mething or someone to look up to because it creates a mindset of me dow n here and 'them' up there. That's not Oneness, it is division and hierarchy. The New Age talks of Onenes s, but uses the language of polarity - the very system through which the world of vibrat ion can manifest. Like the mainstream religions, the New Age believes in the existence of 'light' and 'dark', but these polarities create each other. If you believe in the light you must be lieve in the dark or you would not have to distinguish be tween the two. Belief in one creates the other. There is no light or dark, this is on e of the greatest illusions that pervade the Matrix. Light and dark are programs, th e same with good and bad, male and "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"144 female. Everything is One. There are no di visions, merely the illusions of them. 'Demons only manifest in mi nds that believe in them', the voice in Brazil said. If Infinite Love is the only truth and everyt hing else is illusio n, how can de mons be anything but illusions? I have said before that what you fight you become and it is also true that what we fight we create and give power t o. This is not a fight for the light or a fight against the dark or anythi ng else. Fighting is a Matrix program. It doesn't care why we fight or wh o we fight, so long as we do. I have been seeking to show how all th e religions, be they worshipped in a church, stone circle or stoc k market, are the same God Pr ogram in different guises. They are fundamental to the re ality maze that is the Matr ix and it is al ways trying to guide you, through the DNA, onto a road to nowhere. If it doesn't get you one way, it will try another. This is not a c ondemnation of those who pursue a religion, only an effort to expose th e traps that lie within. There are many wonderful people with big open hearts who advocate Christ ianity, Judaism, Is lam, the New Age, Sikhism and all the others I mention. They have a right to believe what they do, as they have every right to sa y that I am talking through my anal muscles. One radio caller in America even called me 'Satan' be cause I said Jesus did not exist. Fine, it doesn't matter to me because people have a right to express their opinion and I say Jesus and Satan are different expressi ons of the same God Program anyway. I have been attacked and condemned by many Christians, Jews, Muslims, New Agers, all shades of political opinion, and even many of those researching the global conspiracy. Normally thes e people would appear to have little or nothing in common, but in fact they ar e profoundly connected. Th ey all have a dogma to defend and I am challenging dogma and its impos ition. This is why I seem to unite sections of these apparently disparat e groups in mutual condemnation. The religions are different versions of the same program spawned by the Matrix, and in exposing this virtual- reality game I will inevitably upset those who allow it to think for them. If that is as it mu st be, no problem. They have a right to believe in their religion and I have a right to say what I do. It's called Freedom. Funny how religions, and peop le in general, want the freedom to promote their own beliefs, yet seek to sile nce those who present another view. But, then, that's the Matrix for you. Fairness and justice were neve r its strongest points.

'Why are things done this way when it would be much better for people if ...' WHOA, hold it right there. Societies are not structured to be 'better for people' or any other life form. That's not the idea. They are designed to serve the Matr ix, full stop, end. When you observe what we call society from the pers pective of the virtua l-reality game, and understand its agenda, you can see the me thod in the apparent madness we call 'life'. The Matrix is a multi-dimensional , self-powered, free energy machine. The definition of free energy is something that produces more ener gy than it needs for itself. It is like yo ur computer taking el ectricity from the pl ug for its own needs while somehow using that to produce energy for the w hole house. The Matrix is a system which manipulates consciousness tr apped within its vibratory illusions to generate the energy that fuels the system . That energy is fear and its related emotions. To achieve this, the Matrix must: 1 Entrap consciousness in an illusory reality and cause it to 'forge t' what it really is - the Infinite One. This is done through the system of broadcasting information in waveform that the D NA/RNA decodes into holograms that appear to be a 'solid' world. 2 Manipulate consciousness to believe its thoughts and emotions are its own and not the programmed reactions of the body software through the DNA. This is not difficult when we are constantly hearing thoughts and feeling emotions. Why would we think they were not ours unless we understand the game? Most people have no problem with the idea th at mind control can implant thoughts (just watch a stage hypnotist at work) an d what the Matrix does is just an infinitely more advanced ve rsion of this principle. 145 I"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"146 3 Instil a belief in the passage of time by using the Ageing Program and the Solar System Program that includes a night and a day. As Oneness is a state of 'no time', any consciousness caught in the illusion of time will disconnect from awareness of the One. Vibration (time illusion) and stillness (no time) are not easy to connect when you are caught in the dreamworld. 4 Convince consciousness that it is not in cont rol of its own destiny and instead is at the mercy of random events or some version of God (same program, different uniforms). The use of the God Program software ensures that religious advocates spend their lives on their literal and symbo lic knees while hoping this will bring them reward from their God in the next worl d. This is also part of the Carrot and Donkey Program - put them in a state of pe rpetually living for 'tomorrow' so they will follow your orders today. But 'tomorrow' never comes and the carrot is always in the 'future'. The crucial word in this program is 'hope', which always locates your focus on some distant point that never arrives because hope, by its very nature, exists only as an illusory forward projection. This is also a version of the Carousel Program - no matter how fast you go you never get closer to the one in front. Never mind, you can always hope you will. 5 Convince consciousness that it is not in control of its own destiny and instead is at the mercy of random events because life is an accident of evolution, a series of chemical reactions, and death is a ticket to oblivion, no returns available. This I'm a Cosmic Accident Program is for those who don't go for the God scam. Prominent victims are most mainstream scientists and academics, and groups like the Humanists. They also include those, like my father, who equate religion with life after death and so, when they rightly reject religion, the baby and the bathwater both end up in the street. 6 Structure society with different races (DNA software) and beliefs (DNA software) through which you can manipulate conflict and therefore ... fear. Ah, nectar. The more wars you manipulate, the more fear you generate, and you supplement this diet with the Fear I Won't Survive Program and its trademarked offshoots, the Fear My Loved Ones Won't Survive Program and the Fear My Country Won't Survive Program. All these are available in a boxed set called Scare Them Shitless - The Greatest Hits. 7 Plant your own software programs, the Re d Dresses, throughout society to Pied Piper-conscious beings in the direction you want them to go. You install these software 'bloodlines' to control the religions, including the worship of the Money God, and to create dependency on these 'families' by the conscious population, not least by making money the major focus of both success and survival. There are different versions of this throughout what we call history (Figure 79)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"147 From these seven points the entire control of the Matrix is possible if consciousness buys the sales pitch, and the manipulation I described in chapter on e can now be seen in much sharper focus. We can understand at a far deeper level why the Illuminati - the Matrix Red Dresses - are so obsessed with controlling the flow of information through ownership of the media. They want to prevent consci ous beings from communicating thoughts and facts that challenge the implanted reality of the software broadcast through DNA. Also, by pr esenting the 'news' in a form that stimulates f ear, conflict and division, they are constantly activating the emotional responses in the DNA that slumbering consciousness misguidedly be lieves are its own. In fall ing for these DNA emotional triggers, and allowing them to dictate its state of being, consci ousness generates the fear that powers the Matrix. It is like wa tching a horror film with the theatre feeding off the fear it produces from you. This is how the system pro duces more energy than it needs for itself. It takes energy to run the communication networks of the Matrix, but deluded consciousness in a state of fear, stress, guilt , anger, hatred and frustration, generates far more . The Matrix also absorbs enormous amounts of fear from the daily killing ritual s of the 'natural world'. Consciousness experiencing animal DNA software is simi larly in a perpetua l state of fear caused by predators and the battle to survive. The Fear I Won' t Survive Program applies to animals as to humans, of course, and so does, at least in most cases, the Fear My Offspring Won't Survive Program, as with the example of the Grey Whale, among millions of others. Controlling the information th at people absorb is crucia l to the Matrix because consciousness must be held in the illusion by every means possible. I have used the analogy before of the ball floating on top of a tank of wa ter. That is its natural state, floating on the surface, and to hold it on the bottom demands constant effort. The moment you let go, whoosh, it is back at the top again because that is its prime "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"148 reality. It is the same wi th consciousness. If you don't bombard it with hypnotic messages to implant an illusion it is go ing to revert or, in the language of computers, 'default', to its prime stat e - Oneness in awaren ess of itself. The education system or Sausage Machine Progr am is a vital part of this hypnotism. The 'education' program is en coded with three main aims: 1 To implant a belief in reality in line with the Matrix illusion. This is simple enough. You just give stud ents the official version of science, history, religion, mathema tics and the world in general. You do this by programming the teachers through school, university and teacher training college and you send them out to program the next generation with the same crap they have been told to teach and believe. As Oscar Wilde said: 'Most people are other people. Their thoughts are so meone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passio ns a quotation.' Most teacher s, like doctors, scientists, media people and so on, are what my friend, Mike La mbert, calls 'repeaters'. They just repeat what someone else has told them instead of accessing, through consciousness, their own trut h. It is second-hand reality. The process is similar to downloading information onto a disk (teache r) and then making lots of copies (children and students). Little or nothing is allowed to be discussed in the schools and colleges outside of this mainstream version of life and there are few, if any, points of alternative reference fr om which to observe this indoctrinated reality from another perspective. Childre n go through this mind machine while living with adults (more repeaters) w ho have absorbed the same programming and while watching a media (still more repeaters) parrot th e same official story. No wonder they believ e the illusion is real when every source of 'information' is telling them it is. 2 To turn children into robots who follow the orders of the 'teacher' (system). This requires the Carrot and Stick Program . You make it much easier for students to accept the will of the teachers (the sy stem personified) than to question their authority and what they tell them to believe. You reward one and punish the other. 'Do as I say and believ e what I tell you' is instille d from the earliest of ages in the daily indoctrination we call schoo l, college and university. Exams are the system demanding to be told what it has told you to think. They are proof or otherwise of downloading. When you download some thing onto a computer a little box comes up that says: 'Do you want to open this file now?' You open it to make sure the information has downloaded correctly. This is what exams are. Maverick children who refuse to do wnload are considered a disruptive influence. Have you noticed that wh ile there may be di sagreements on how children are taught, there is rarely discu ssion about what they are taught? This is because the Matrix has such a grasp on human reality that what is taught is pretty much universally accepted. Indeed, if sch ools introduced courses on spirituality relating to the Oneness of all and the illusion of form, parents controlled by the God Progra m would furiously protest th at this was an offence to "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"149 their Christian, Jewish, Islami c etc., etc., beliefs. Chil dren are not only fed poison through their mouths, but through their minds, too. 3 To squeeze out of the ta rget population (children) any idea that they can be unique and spontaneous. Schools are mostly no-go areas for spont aneity and free thought because they are consumed by rules. This is perfect preparation for the adult world which is structured in the same way. The only di fference is that the teachers for adults are called police officers, government offi cials, tax inspectors and all the other, mostly unknowing, clones that serve th e Matrix. I was reading how a senior school in England has banned pupils from holding hands or cuddling with their boyfriends and girlfriends on the premis es. The headmaster justified this by saying that such behaviour by adults would not be allowed 'in the workplace'. This sad man was actually revealing a si mple truth. Schools are primarily there to prepare young people to be adult cogs in a machine called 'the workplace'. Children are moulded to become a collectiv e 'hive' mind (a trait of the reptilian brain) rather than expressions of unique ness. Do the same, behave the same and believe the same. Another thing: why shouldn't adults be allowed to kiss and cuddle 'in the workplace' ? Jeeez, only in the Matr ix could affection be legislated. Control doesn't only involve the suppression of information. It also targets the DNA/RNA and its central processing unit, the brain, to further scramble the circuitry and the ability of consciousness to see beyond th e veil. This is the real reason behind the chemical additives in what we eat and drink, and all the electromagnetic pollution. Wh en consciousness dictates the reality of the DNA instead of the progra m, none of this will matter; bu t while we are slaves of the DNA/Matrix reality we can be seriously affected. It is im portant to stress that we are in control if we open to consciousness because to say that th is chemical or that technology will cause this or that illness can program the computer to manifest the outcome by believing in it. I wonder how many health scares trigger the very problems they warn about? So I emphasise that the following ca n and does happen, but it doesn't have to. We have the power to override it. Genetically modified food is produced by manipulating DNA and the idea is to use this to manipulate our DNA. A vital point in relation to GM food is that DNA is interchangeable between species. As that ar ticle in the San Francisco Chronicle said: '... DNA is a universal software code. From bacteria to humans, the basic instructions for life are writte n with the same language'. A brain cell in one species, for example, will work in all the others (rem ember how the rat cells flew the jet simulator). It is qu ite possible, therefore, to targ et and change human DNA through the DNA in what we consume - and that 's precisely what they're doing. They're rewriting the software to su it their agenda of control. In North America, GM food is in ev er wider circulation and the Illuminati biotech companies are seeking to exploit hun ger in places like Africa to dump their "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"150 foul products and rewire the people in that continent. When these corporations say they are doing this because they want to help the hungry and downtrodden, it's like the Nazis saying they built the concentration camps beca use they wanted to help Jews, gypsies and communists. Michael Me acher, the Minister of State for the Environment, sacked by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003, has highlighted the lack of research and the serious risk posed by GM food. He also said that Bl air appeared uninterested in the science and was determ ined that GM be given the go-ahead. This is because Blair is an Illuminati pa wn following their ag enda. Pressure on the UK government has delayed the official permission for GM crops to be grown in the UK, but those behind the plan know that the contaminat ion of non-GM crops is like a cancer. The GM 'trials' in Britain will have already contaminated a much wider area than the government admits and once a new location has been affected it, in turn, contaminates even further. Plus the fact the UK is now controlled by the Uluminati European Union an d this fascist power bloc will make the ultimate decision. The EU, no matter how it presents its myth of 'tough safety measures', will eventually give the biotech companies (Illuminati) what they want unless there is a mass public campaign to stop it. The overseas experience has confirmed the dangers of contamination and the creation of genetically modified 'superwe eds'. In Canada, contamination has been a disaster for non-GM farmers and a 2003 report in Mexico re vealed that it was much worse than believed possible. Analysis s howed the presence in apparently non-GM crops of two, three and four GM vari eties, all patented by transnational biotechnology companies. Once contaminat ed, even if it is your worst nightmare, the corporations can, and do , demand royalties for growing their patented crops! The arrogance of the biotech companies knows no bounds. In one media report, Simon Barber, a spokesman for the EU biot ech industry associat ion, EuropaBio, said organic farmers were being unreasonable to demand absolutely no cross- pollination. 'Cross-pollination is normal and natural - it happens', he said. What a prat. GM food is about cont rol of the food supply, cont rol of farming through GM 'royalties', even from those who don't wa nt it and, crucially, the manipulation of our DNA and it's ability to co mmunicate accurately. This is part of a coordinated chemical, electromagnetic a nd vibrational onslaught against the human body, mind and emotions. The loudest voice behind GM is Monsanto of St Louis, Missouri, one of the most important Uluminati companies on the plan et. These were the guys behind Agent Orange, used to grotesque effect in the Vi etnam War and this is also the corporation marketing the brain-scrambler known as aspartame. This was manipulated through the Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA) 'safety checks' by Donald Ru msfeld, the US Defense Secretary under Boy George Bush, and CEO of Seale Pharmaceuticals when he used his buddies in the Reagan-Father Bush administration to have fundamental doubts abou t the safety of aspartame ignore d. Searle later sold out to Monsanto and now aspartame is in an ever-growing number of drinks and foodstuffs, a trend only stemmed by the fear of class action lawsui ts over its effect on human health. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"151 You will find aspartame in instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatine desserts, juices, laxatives, multivitamins, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and suppleme nts, shake mixes, soft drinks, tabletop sweeteners, teas, in stant coffees, t opping mixes, wine coolers and yoghurt. And these are on ly some examples. Aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and marketed under its own name and trademarked brands like NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Equal- Measure. Some of the 90 different documented symptoms reported to be caused by aspartame include: headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms, weight gain, rashes, depres sion, fatigue, irritability, t achycardia (abn ormally rapid heart rate), insomnia, vision problems, h earing loss, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of tast e, tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss and joint pain. The r eason for this appalling catalogue of disease is that aspartame disrupts the DNA communication system. The US Air Force formally warned all its pilots not to consum e diet drinks in their official flying safety bulletin in Ma y and August 1992 because of the effects of aspartame on their ability to fly a plane. Many other non-military pilots have complained of the same symptoms, incl uding seizures. A 1990 edition of Plane and Pilot magazine told the story of an Ai r Force pilot who traced the patterns of tremors and seizures he suffered for tw o years directly to his consumption of NutraSweet. When he stopped drinking di et sodas his symptoms stopped, but when he resumed so did the tremors. His problems worsen ed until a grand mal seizure ended his career. But, once agai n, his symptoms disappeared when he ditched the NutraSweet. Plane and Pilot also reported this case: 'After only two cups of artificially sweetened hot chocolate, a pilo t experienced blurred vision so severe he was unable, in flight, to read the instruments and very narrowly avoided a tragic landing. Safely on the ground, he relate d his symptoms to the secretaries in his office. [He told] of experiencing similar symptoms after ingesting aspartame products.' Aspartame contains methanol (wood alcohol), a poison that causes blindness and death. Two teaspoons ar e considered lethal. Smalle r doses destroy the brain (DNA central proces sing unit) little by li ttle, because the effe cts are cumulative. Depending on the tole rance level of the person, the e ffects can be severe like epileptic seizures, including grand mal, blindness, chest palpitations, blurred vision, bright flashes, tunnel vision, ring ing or buzzing in ears , migraine headaches, dizziness and loss of equilib rium. Other psychological pr oblems are caused by the phenylalanine in aspartame depleting levels of serotonin, a brain chemical and neurotransmitter that regulates, among other things, behaviour and sleep patterns. Laboratory tests have also shown that aspartame can ch ange the DNA. Here we go again, and this is the prime reason behind the daily chemical bombardment through food, drink and environm ental sources. Imagin e what the effect on children is going to be of all the aspartame-poisoned sh ite they are consuming by the bucketful today, especially in soft drinks. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"152 Damage to the brain and the DNA is a constant theme when you research the poisons that infest what we consume, br eathe, and absorb th rough technologies. Aspartame is what is called an excitotoxin, or neurotox in, and so is the 'flavour enhancer', monosodium glutamate, or MSG. You'll find this in almost every mass- produced foodstuff and it tricks the brain to taste more flavou r than is actually there. It is often disg uised in the list of ingredients as 'natural flavour/flavourings' when it is nothing of the kind in the form it is used. MSG also hides behind terms like 'hydrolyzed', 'autolyzed', and yeas t extract or nutrient, among many other pseudonyms. Americans alone are apparently consum ing 160 milli on pounds of this stuff every year and yet it is a brain pois on. Dr George Schwar tz, a toxicologist and author, says that two ta blespoons of MSG will kill a dog in minutes. Some of the health effects linked to MSG include heart problems, Alzeimer's, Parkinson's, asthma, cancer, birth defects, obesity a nd ... brain damage. MSG attacks what is called the brain-blood barrier, a defence system that normally prevents toxins entering the brain. Even tiny amounts of t oxic substances like MSG and aspartame can cause the brain cell to so overreact that it become s exhausted and dies. Hence they are called excitotoxins. MSG, a crys talline substance like DNA, damages parts of the brain like the hypo thalamus that govern many systems in the body. As with aspartame, MSG also causes f ood cravings and can make people fat. The epidemic of obesity exploding across the world is largely ca used by these additives, the use of which has mirrored the rise in overweight people. This epidemic is caused to a large extent by the effect on the hypothalamus that regulates hunger and weight. Rats fed MSG became massively obese and their hypothalamus was found to be in a shocking state. Another similarity with aspartame is the way MSG was allowed onto the market wi thout adequate safety chec ks and most of the later studies into its health effects have been conducted - as usual - by 'researchers' linked to the food giants. The food corporations that prof it massively from MSG say that it's safe. Phew, that's okay, th en, you had me worri ed for a second. I mentioned in an earlier chapter how va ccines contain mercury. Even in small amounts this, yet again, is known to damage DNA and impair its ability to repair itself. It also destabilises the neurotubules that are fundamental to normal brain cell function. Mercury activates microglial cells and th is, as with aspartame and MSG, increases excitotoxicity that adversely affects br ain function. The potential neurological consequences include autism. Studies by the Univ ersity of Calgary Faculty of Medicine discovered rapid da mage to brain cells from minute amounts of mercury. They concluded that it causes neurological damage consistent with Alzheimer's. An indication of the pot ential for mercury to devastate the DNA body-mind-emotion network is the story of an English woman called Mary Stephenson. At the age of 21, she had 19 teeth filled with amalgam (52 per cent of which is mercury) and she began to suffer from crippling suicid al depression that no therapist or antidepressant could treat. It was only 40 years of hell later that a friend suggested that her condition might be caused by her mercury fillings. She had them replaced, went on a mercury det oxification course to clear the residue, and her depression disappeared. 'Every morning when I woke I thought, \"Oh no, "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"153 another day, how am I going to get through this?\" Now I ca n't wait to jump out of bed in the morning to get on with life.' The only difference wa s the mercury in her mouth that, as with all am algam fillings, was seeping into her bloodstream and short-circuiting her brain. The cell recepto rs that 'catch' the peptide chemicals secreted by emotional states are the sa me ones that absorb mercury and other chemicals in drugs, food and drink. As I sa id earlier, emotional chemicals affect the body and chemicals ab sorbed by the body affect emotions. The Illuminati want fluoride to be adde d to drinking water be cause it, too, is a brain and DNA scrambler. For many years it has been established that fluoride inhibits the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase. This is involved in transmitting signals along nerves. Russian studies, both clinical and physiological, established that patients with dental fluorosis also suff ered from disturbed nervous activity and brain dysfunction. Chinese scientists repor ted in 1995 that fluoride lowered the IQ. They compared children ag ed eight to 13 who had no fl uorosis with those who had slight, medium and serious le vels of it. Their findings re vealed a five to 19 point decrease in IQ score for the children with severe fluorosis compared with those who had none. A second study of children aged seven to 14 consumi ng different levels of fluoride confirmed the findings. Fluoride attacks th e immune system, our Norton AntiVirus, by diminishing its ability to recogn ise threats and causing what is called Autoimmune Disease. Cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and sc lerosis are just some of the conditions that result from such malfunction. Th e effect of fl uoride on the thyroid, which regulates the metabolism, can cause endless problems throughout the body and a 1955 report in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a 400 per cent increase in cancer of the thyroid in San Francisco during th e period its water was fluoridated. Most people have no idea wh at is in this stuff and where it comes from. They just accept without question th at it is good for teeth beca use this is what they are told to believe. Fluoride is a waste product of the al uminium industry and has been used in rat poison. Now it is in many drinking-wate r supplies (with plans for continuing expansion) and almost every brand of toothpaste! The claim that fluoride protects teeth from decay is nonsense and this lie is demolished in And The Truth Shall Set You Free and in endless other publications and studies. Dr Hardy Limeback, head of the Depart ment of Preventive Dentis try for the University of Toronto and president of the Canadian As sociation for Dental Research, was his country's leading advocate of fluoride. Then he woke up to the fact he had been given false data and that 'the vast major ity of all fluoride additives come from Tampa Bay, Florida, smokestac k scrubbers'. He said that unsuspecting people were being exposed to deadly elements of lead , arsenic and radium, all of them cancer- causing. 'Because of the cumulative properti es of toxins, the detrimental effects on human health are catastrophi c', he said. A study at th e University of Toronto discovered that fluoride was 'altering the basic architecture of human bones'. Limeback also said that Ca nada was spending more mone y treating dental fluorosis than treating cavities. He said that fluoride had been in Toronto' s drinking water for some 40 years while Vancouver was fluo ride free, but that Toronto had more "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"154 Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is Illusion cavities per head than Vancouver. This scam is nothing to do with teeth. It is about its effect on the brain. The Nazis put fluoride in the water supp lies of the concentrat ion camps to mind- suppress the inmates, and destabilising br ain function is the motivation behind its wider introduction. Dr Limeback said that he had unint entionally misled people for 15 years because he had refused to study to xicology information re adily available to anyone. 'Poisoning our children was the furt hest thing from my mind', he said. I admire his honesty, and hi s words encapsulate why we have a medical profession claiming to know what is sa fe and good for us when all they are doing is repeating what the system tells them to say and believe. They are just sitting on th eir lucrative perches saying, 'Who's a pretty boy, then?' Mobile phones are another at tempt to short-circuit the central processing unit. Dr Gerald Hyland, a British physicist, said that if mobile phones we re a type of food they 'simply would not be licensed'. If Donald Rumsfeld was behind them they probably would, but the point is taken. Dr Hyland's findings were published in the medical journal, The Lancet, and reflect a gathering concer n about the effects on the brain of mobile-phone frequencies. One of hi s concerns is that cellphone use can be linked with aggressive behaviour in childre n, but it goes much further. A study by the Spanish Neuro Diagnostic Research Instit ute showed that a tw o minute call can open the 'blood-brain ba rrier', allowing toxins in the bl oodstream to kill brain cells. This is what MSG and aspartame do. Even such a short call also disrupts electrical activity in a child's brain fo r up to an hour. 'This has potential for psychiatric and behavioural problems and impaired learni ng', the Spanish study said. Sweden's Lund University Hospital supported these findings and claimed that radiation emitted by mobile handsets and relay towers can destroy cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory, movement and learning. Japanese scientist Masaru Emoto exposed water to the electromagnetic waves of a mobile phone and you can see the im pact by comparing Figures 80 and 81. The water crystal was slaughtered by the effect and that is what these ph ones and masts are doing to us! Cellphone relay towers seem to be everywhere now and a common location is near schools! In November 2004, a report by the BBC, also detailed in The Mail on Sunday, revealed how Britain ha d 40,000 mobile-phone masts and one in ten schools had a mast located within 200 me tres of the classrooms. A Central London school had 27 masts within this distance, many of them hidden from public view inside road and petrol station signs. When three mobile phone giants: T-Mo bile, Orange and Hu tchison 3G, were allowed to erect a 25-metre mast near thre e schools in Harrogate , North Yorkshire, a group of parents took the case to court. They wanted to protect their children from this blatant danger to their health, but the outcome was inev itable because the courts represent the system not the people. The local co uncil had refused permission for the mast and the phone companies went to the High Court to have the decision overturned. The parents didn't want it, the local c ouncil didn't want it, but it was forced upo n them by judges hundreds of miles aw ay in London who will never go near the place. The parents challe nged the decision at the Court of Appeal, "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" (For more examples see the books, Messages from Water, volumes one and two, by Masaru Emoto) but Lord Justice Laws decr eed that 'perceived health concerns' would only be considered (by system-appointed judges) in 'exceptional circum stances' (when the system didn't mind). Even the National Radiological Protection Board advises a 'precautionary approach' to locating masts near schools, but Lord 'Justice' System knew best. 'It remains central government's responsibility to deci de what measures are necessary to prot ect public health', he said. Oh, please. As this book was going into production in 2005, Professor Sir William Stewart, chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board, published a study warning parents not to allow children under eight to use mobile phones and highlighting the potential dangers for all users. The report, 'Mobile Phones and H ealth', said that four investigations had caused concern ab out the effect on the brain of cellphone frequencies, including a German study that suggested an increase in cancer around masts. Professor Stewart said that 'evi dence of potentially harmful effects had become more persuasive over the past fi ve years'. Translated , this means that governments have been quite happy to use the population, including children, as guinea pigs for the transnational corpor ations, when anyone who had the most basic understanding of the workings of th e brain would know from the start how lethal they could be. Ther e are 4,700 new cases of br ain tumours every year in Britain - an increase of 45% in 30 years, according to the UK Brain Tumour Society. I wonder why? Duh? Neil Cherry, a biophysicist at Lincoln University in Christchurch, New Zealand, considers the proliferation of cellph ones, microwave towe rs and microwave pollution to be a serious contributor to cancer, brain tumo urs and increasing neurological problems. Leif Salford, head of the Lund University research team, said the exposure of the brain to microwaves from mobile phones is the largest human biological experiment ever. As us e of the technology continues to expand, 155"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"156 he said, people may 'drown in a sea of microwaves'. He warned that neurons, which would normally not beco me senile until pe ople reached thei r 60s, could now do so 30 years earlier. 'We can see reduce d brain reserve capacit y', he said. This could lead to an increase in Alzheimer's, or dementia and, at best, people would have 'a significantly diminished number of non-dysfunctional br ain cells and brain subsystems throughout their lives'. Ge orge W. Bush must ha ve never been off the phone. The point that even these research ers miss, however, is that mobile phones and their towers are not a biological 'experim ent' at all. They ar e part of a coldly calculated attack by the Il luminati on brain function. It's not so much the power of electromagnetic emissions that poses the greatest danger, but the frequency they resonate. The frequencies once again disrupt the messages passing between the DNA/RNA and this inaccurate and confused information leads the cells and other systems to malfunc tion, just as a computer would in such circumstances. The pulses of digital mobiles mimic the signals of the body's cells and the DNA become s an antenna for the frequ encies emitting from the handset. How appropriate that they are called cellphones. The Journal of Cellular Biochemistry reported that heavy cellphone use could ca use brain can cer and other diseases by interf ering with DNA repair of waywar d cells. Dr George Carlo, an epidemiologist, conducted a six year stud y and found that wireless phone radiation caused DNA damage. The common theme of al l this crap they are feeding us through food, drink and technology is ... DNA damage and disruption, especially to the brain. They are seeking to short-circuit the DNA/R NA communications to stop consciousness imposing itself in the Matri x. People with what used to be called mental handicap do not have a problem with their consciousness, but with its ability to be expressed through a damaged central processing unit. It is the same with mental illness. Outside of this vibrational reality th ey are not handicapped or mentally ill, it happens on the level of DNA - the target of the Illuminati for humans in general. Yet despite all of this, th e social programming is such that mobile phones are now considered an essential part of chil dhood culture. A stu dy reported in the UK Daily Telegraph found that mobile phones are 'indispensable' to teenagers and text messaging is 'an integral part of how th ey express and define themselves'. More than three-quarters of those surveyed agr eed with the statemen t: 'I could not bear to be without my phone'. The Ma trix has them. I keep hearing how misbehaved children ar e today and how it is more difficult to control them, and so on. But are you surprised? Childr en more than anyone are being deluged with attacks on their DNA and brain circuitry through the horrendous chemicals in their soft drinks, fast food and vaccines, even without the mobile phones and transmitter towers. A Time magazine article in April 1994 highlighted the rise in child behavioural disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders that had been unheard of 15 ye ars earlier were a ffecting 3.3 million American children when the article wa s published. Goodness knows what the figures must be today. Now let us do the maths: 1994 minus 15 = 1979. So the enormous rise in child behavioural problems began in the 1980s. MSG and "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"157 aspartame (the duel attack is particularly damaging) had flooded the food industry by the mid-1980s and this is no coincidence. The system's reaction to children aff ected by the poisons the system feeds to them is to prescribe brain- damaging drugs like Ritalin an d Prozac from the system's pharmaceutical cartel to poison them ev en more. These drugs are also used to suppress children who refuse to download the system's reality. Peter R. Breggin, Director of the Internationa l Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology at Johns Hopkins University, says that Ritalin decreases bl ood flow to the brain and routinely causes other gross malfunctio ns to what I ca ll the DNA's central processing unit. As he put it: 'Ritalin doe s not correct biochemical imbalances - it causes them'. Other Ritalin effects include possible shrinkage or other permanent physical abnormalities of the brain, disruption of growth hormone causing suppression of growth in the body and brain, psychosis (mania), depression, insomnia, agitation, addiction, daily withdr awal reactions, impair ed ability to learn, and the worsening of hyperactivity and inatte ntion - the very symptoms the drug is supposed to improve! I found a website where you can order Prozac, produced by the Bush family-connected El i Lilly, without prescripti on. The section about side effects said you should consult your docto r if you experience any of the following: Fever; seizures; suicidal tendencies; heart pounding; anxiety; weakness; weight loss; loss of appetite; nausea ; dry mouth; upset stomach; sleeplessness; nervousness; drowsiness; tremor; sweating; flu syndrome; headache; diarrhoea; dizziness; sore throat; sinus inflammation; sweating; gas; changes in vision; rash; yawning; decreased sex drive; abnormal dreams; impo tence; abnormal ejaculation; chills; bleeding; increased appetite; vomiting; weig ht gain; agitation; amnesia; confusion; changes in behaviour; sleep disorder; ear pa in; changes in taste; ringing in the ears; frequent urination; increase in blood pressure. Prozac is a brain reprogrammer like all th e others, and it is ha nded out like candy to children and adults under the guise of controlling bad behaviour. But far from doing that, Prozac has been linked to ma ny of the children and young people involved in infamous acts of inexplicable violence. One of the effects of these drugs is that people lose their capacity for empathy. Eric Harris was on Prozac when he walked around Columbine Hi gh School laughing as he killed his schoolmates, even those he liked. So were others who have exhibited similar behaviour. What is happening to children is nothing less than legalised child abuse. The Illuminati are at war with the kids, especially with th eir minds, and so are the parents who won't wake up to what is happening. Even when they do they face the gathering power of the fascist state that seeks to contro l their children. The Bush Administration launched the Orwellian 'New Freedom Initiative' that plans to introduce the compulsory screening of ever y American for mental illn ess and they are starting with the kids. A 'commission' was recru ited from the Illuminati pharmaceutical cartel in 2001 to study ment al illness in the population an d it reported that 'despite their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed'. As a solution to this problem it recommended comprehensive ment al health screening for 'consumers of all ages', including preschool child ren, because the emotional disorders of "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"158 childhood were often 'undiagnosed and unt reated'. Who will decide who needs treatment? The government and the pharmaceutical cartel will - in other words, the Illuminati. All these attacks on brain ce ll communication will also be having consequences for the role of the corpus callosum that connects both hemisphe res of the brain and transmits information between them. It is in the interests of the Illuminati to stop us integrating these 'two minds' into a unified whole because it keeps us in a state of imbalance and separation. They particularly want us to be dominated by left brain reality, which is mirrored in the materialistic, bott om-line, 'western society' that has colonised the world. The mo re they can suppress info rmation passing from the intuitive right hemisphere in to the left, the more they will imprison perception in the world of 'matter', words and hologra phic form - the Time Loop. I'm sure the corpus callosum is a major target of the chemical and electrom agnetic onslaught on the human brain. I describe the microchip as the jewel in the crown of the Illuminati (Matrix) agenda because it is their most effective potential we apon in the control of our DNA/RNA. Microchips are abou t surveillance on one level, but that's not the main motive. They want people to be microchipp ed to give them a direct connection to the DNA circuitry that re gulates our 'physical' health and our mental and emotional states and responses. The mi nd and emotions are phenomena of the DNA and can be manipulated by reprog ramming the DNA a nd the way the RNA reads the program. This is why the CIA scie ntist told me in 1997 that messages sent from the computer to a hu man microchip could kill people, cause severe pain or illness, and manipulate them mentally and emotionally. He said this included making them docile or aggressive, sexua lly high or suppressed, and affecting their thought processes to the extent that they couldn't think st raight or were influenced in their actions by what the chip was re ceiving. How appropriate that the central processing unit in a personal computer is housed in a single microchip called a microprocessor. The Illuminati microchippi ng agenda is about inserting a mini brain which they control. Once you realise the nature of the game , and what the world really is, you can see from a much wider perspe ctive why the Illuminati do what they do. As I will come to later, an awakening is gatheri ng pace, and consciousne ss is beginning to impose itself on the DNA program in in creasing numbers of people. Suppressing this by making the DNA misfire throug h attacks from microchips, GM food, aspartame, and all the other assaults on brain communications an d activity, is what all this is really about. This war on the human body/mind/emotions includes government policies to ban the use of health food supplements and vitamins, or to make the dose so small th at it makes no difference. Illuminati societies are f ounded on dependency because this allows the few to dictate to the dependent many and limit, ag ain, through fear, wh at people will or will not say and do. Even mo st of those conscious bein gs that have begun to see through levels of the game will not act or speak about their realisations because they fear the conse quences. These invariably involve fear of losing job, money or"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"159 status, often all th ree. As I said in chapter one, soci ety is structured as a pyramid of dependency with almost everyone havi ng a boss to answer to. Through this dependency, and divide and rule, the system itself beco mes the governor. A factory worker may have to answer to the superv isor, the supervisor to the manager, the manager to the CEO, the CEO to the chairman and the chairman to the shareholders. But in the end they all answer to, and depe nd upon, the system - It That Must Be Obeyed. The sy stem is a Matrix program. No matter how powerful you may appear to be, even a president or prime minister, the system is God. World lead ers come and go, as do top bankers and business tycoons, but the syst em rolls on. It is designed to think for us and most people concede their reality to its threats and seductions. Ask even genuine politicians why some humanitarian policy cannot be implemente d and they'll say the way the system is struct ured won't allow it. Why can' t we just give our surplus food to people in poor co untries who are starving? No, that would destroy local farmers and disrupt our own agricultural policy. Well, why don't we have the transnationals give those people back th eir food-growing land so they can feed themselves then? No, that would harm our big companies and affect food supplies, jobs and the economy at home . Here are hungry people and here are two ways of feeding them, but neithe r is believed possible because of the system. It is designed to block changes that don't se rve its desire for the sufferi ng, stress and conflict that generate its life force - fear. Every year the BBC has a telethon, called Ch ildren in Need, to raise money from viewers for kids and their families who are ofte n desperate for help and support. The projects the money is spent on sh ould be 'gimmes' in any decent, consciousness-led society. But children who are handi capped, in poor health, poverty or emotional distress, have to de pend on a night of ch arity to enjoy what should be a right. It is bl atant confirmation that the sy stem, and those who serve it, are deeply sick. In 2004, Children in Need raised £17 million during the evening from donations and fund-raising events across the country. In 2003, more than £90 million worth of missiles, bombs and ammunition was fired by British forces in the first 11 days of the Iraq wa r. America is another country plagued by poverty and basic need and yet estimates by the Nati onal Priorities Proj ect using official records said that by the start of 2005 the cost of the war had exceeded $152 billion (see costofwar.com for details). All this in a worl d in which, as the UN reported in 2004, a child dies of hunger every five seconds. To think that all those people voted fo r Bush because they said he stood for moral values. There is never enough money to help people, but always enough to kill them. Tony Blair, who committed billi ons to the Iraq in vasion and occupation, had the nerve to say how mu ch he supported Children in Need (good PR, see). 'There's this huge sense of coming together', he said, 'And the whole country comes together and says this is a cause worth supporting'. If Mr Blair was not a system-serving software program the cause would not require support because there would be no children - or anyone else - in need. But the system wants the wars and it wants the suffer ing. There are no contradictions between money spent "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"160 on need and money spent on war once you realise why the syst em is structured as it is. The priorities of the Matri x, and the Red Dress progra ms I call the Illuminati/ Reptilians, are not the same as incarnate consciousness. One wants to generate fear and the other desires happin ess and joy. This simple u nderstanding reveals so much about why the world is how it is. We may cringe at the da ily slaughter in the killing fields of Iraq, Israel and endless other lo cations around the wo rld where horror is a way of life. We may survey the tens of m illions killed and maimed in the two world wars and reflect on how appalling it all was. But to the Matrix, wars are orgasmic orgies of fear that provid e its power and means of exis tence. A war, especially a world war, is like having billions of power stations feeding energy into the grid. Not only do the troops and civilians immediately involved generate terror and stress, so do all their relatives and entire populations worried about what the outcome will be. It is not only wars that do this. Society in general is designed to keep the energy flowing. The study I mentioned about anxiety and depression in teenagers increasing by 70 per cent in less than 20 years is terr ible news for anyone se eking a happy, joyous and harmonious planet. But to the Matrix it is a magnificent five -course dinner. The fear of those Jewish people terrified of breaking 'God's Law', and all the other religious followers controlled by the same software, are also terrific generators of energy for the Matrix; so is fear of the fu ture and guilt from th e past; fear for the kids and regret about the kids; fear of lo sing your job and a nxiety that you won't get a new one; fear of what people will think and the frustration of not being yourself. Look at your own life and the world in gene ral and it is a global power station generating f ear, frustration and anxiety. If you observe what we call history, you see that every generation ha s been in fear an d under stress for different reasons. Humans (and animals caught in the Laws of Nature Program) are manipulated to fear and vampired by the Matrix for the energy it produces. The Red Dress programs of the Illuminati are encoded to create the di vision, conflict, war an d anxiety that serve this end. The complexity of the system is structured to act like little flying mites biting you and getting you ever more frustrated as you symbolically wave your arms around in search of peace. It wants to keep you in a constant state of anxiety and worry. I am talking about all the forms to fill in , tax laws to observ e, speed cameras to watch, licences to keep valid, and this is now intensified by the 'war on terror' and political correctne ss which pressures you to pre-scan everything you say. Even the ludicrous, incomprehensible road syst ems and one-way maze s in many towns and cities are squeezing more frustration from us as we go round a nd round looking for a way out (see Los Angeles). The same goes for traffic jams, lawyers and the endless red tape designed to suffocate and frustrate us. I am sure you ca n name a long list of things that frustrate you in the way the system operates. And here's the point. At the level of control from whic h society is manipulated, it is meant to be frustrating. It might appear to be bureaucratic incompeten ce and stupidity, an d there are serious numbers of incompetent and stupid bure aucrats, but to the Red Dresses it is "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"161 calculated design to keep us anxious, frustrated and boxed in. Actually, when I wrote that last sentence I mistyped 'i ncompetent' as 'impotent'; it was an appropriate slip. Bureaucrats may seem to have power, but they are really only impotent cogs in the machine and they are as controlled by the Matrix as anyone, often more so because of their rule-obsesse d, law-obsessed, do-it-in-triplicate mentality. The Matrix wants incarnate consciousness to be a mirror of the DNA software. In other words, to react to stimuli/input like a computer does. This is one reason why society is so robotic with, for most peop le, every day pretty much the same as another and ruled by illusory time measured by hands on a clock face. The structure of society is a barrier to spontaneity and increases the speed at which we concede our uniqueness to robotic responses. I men tioned this earlier with reference to education, but the same applies everywhere . Spontaneity is the music of the soul, the inspiration of the One - and maverick spontaneity is the worst nightmare of the Matrix. It opens your DNA to the realms beyond the il lusion and it sings to a different resonance, beats to a different drum. The spontaneous is constantly targeted with an endless array of laws th at say do, don't and can't, or insist you have the right form, licence or permission before anything can be done. The insane multi-million lawsuits issued when people have the smallest of accidents are now seeing the most innocuous games and pastim es banned that were part of everyday life when I was a kid. Most of the idiots behind this political correc tness have no idea that forces they ca nnot begin to comprehend (remembering to breathe is a challenge) are behind this nonsense to further erode what we are allowed to do without the sanction of au thority. It is the Matrix program operating through its imbecilic zombies that think they control the bureaucracy. The car park at the apartmen t block where I live has be en patrolled by a private 'security' firm contracted by the manage ment company to stop people parking in spaces designated for residents. I had no thing to do with this decision, but I was given a card to put on my windscreen to stop me being issued with a fine for parking in my own space. When one da y the card had falle n from the screen a parking ticket was stuck to the car by this security fi rm demanding £60 - well in access of $100 for, yes, park ing in the designated space I had been using for some four years. When I invited the firm not to be so ridiculous they said it was a 'legitimate ticket', even though they accepted that I had every right to park there! Only when I made it clear that they would go to thei r maker still waiting for the money was the demand dropped. This is the level to which we have now descended in terms of policing each other and, in doing so, serving the system of control. The system is structured to ma ke one person's loss an other one's gain and this provides the incentive for the di vide and rule on which it depends. Another expression of the ro botic agenda is the way diversity of culture is being consumed by a universal, vacuous, wastela nd known as the 'moder n way of life'.

It is the perfect backdrop for the robotic mind and is, indeed, its creation. Th e whole rationale of the planned global dictatorship is to complete this cycl e of robotic uniformity through a world government, central bank, currency and army - underpinned by a microchipped populous. What we call globalisation is de signed to stop whole countries from being spontaneous and making decisions that fit their particular wants and needs. You can't do this or you'll face a fine from the European Un ion and you can't do that or you will face a fine from the World Trade Organisa tion; this decision can't be made without permission from the IMF and that decision can't be acted upon without sanction from the World Bank. Ah, yes, banks. The entire banking system, c ontrolled by the Illuminati Red Dress families, has one aim in its programmed mind: to suppress choice (spontaneity) by making almost every choice dependent upon the 'm oney' it controls. Choice is linked to money and money is controlled by the banks, so the banks control choice. Or we are led to believe they d o. The idea is to shackle the popula tion with a constant need to earn money to survive another day, week or month. Hate your job, unhappy and frustrated every day? Well, that's just t oo bad. You have that mo rtgage to pay, debts to service, and a fam ily to feed. What do you think you are, Infinite Consciousness? Keep their heads down, concentrating on survival or pursu ing some system- defined 'success', and they will be prisoners of th e five senses - the DNA. Gotchaaaaaaa! Here you have the ma in reason why society is obsess ed with the five senses of sight, touch, sound, taste and smell. Virtually everything, certainly everything produced by Illuminati manipulation, is aimed at this. Watch any group of television advertisements and the five senses will be the target. These senses are the access codes to the DNA and its central processing unit becaus e they are decoded and defined by the brain and the DNA/RNA network of crystalline transmitter/receivers. What you taste and how it tastes to you is decided by the brain/DNA, as is what you see, feel, hear and smel l (or believe yo u do). The five senses are illusions and they are fundamental to holding us in the bigger Illusion, the Matrix. What you eat, with few exceptions, is pr oduced with chemicals and poisons from Illuminati biotech and ph armaceutical companies that manipulate your brain and tell you what to taste. Wh at you think you see is defined by what the Illuminati, through contro l of media and education, ha ve told you to see. What you hear, like music, is pr oduced by Illuminati corpor ations who decide what artists to support an d sounds (frequencies) to market . Hook the five senses and the fish will swim in the Matrix unaware of what lies beyond the surfac e. If we look again at the words of writer Michael Ellner, we can apprec iate with an even greater awareness why the world is as he describes. He said: 'Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy informatio n and religions destroy spirituality.'"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"163 The why is now obvious: • Doctors destroy health because they ar e pill dispensers for a pharmaceutical cartel that seeks to control people - not heal them. • Lawyers destroy justice because the 'law', together with bankin g, is one of the major means of control and suppression. • Universities destroy know ledge because the Illuminati want an ignorant population programmed to believe the illusion is real. • Governments destroy free dom because they are Il luminati corporations designed to dictate to the people - not serve them. • Major media destroys information because it s role is to captivat e the five senses and peddle the illusion. • Religions destroy spirituality because they were not created to free the spirit, but to trap it in a web of fe ar, limitation and ignorance. This world of illusion is founded on the need to survive and the fear of not doing so. Pick any point on the Time Loop DVD and you wi ll find the same scenario: control through dependency a nd the perceived need to survive. The Matrix itself is in fear of survival, the loss of the energy source on which it depends, and it has structured the illusi on to mirror its own state of being. How could it do anything else? Its 'laws of natu re' are the very epito me of the survival mentality that generates its fo od source. Crucial to the fear of not surviving is the Fear of Death Program. It is this that motivates the cons tant pursuit of survival to postpone our inevitable fate. Fear of death is the spectre that haunts our society and inspires the desperation to survive at all costs. Chinese philosopher Chang- Tzu said of this: The birth of a man is the birth of his so rrow. The longer he lives, the more stupid he becomes, because his anxiety to avoid unavoidable death becomes more and more acute. What bitterness! He lives for what is al ways out of reach! His thirst for survival in the future makes him incapable of living in the present.' It is the fear of oblivion, Judgement Day or the fires of Hell, depending on which version of claptrap you choose to believe in. When Rabbi Furst prepares to depart for that great Cheese Danish in the sky can you imagine his terr or of what may await? It's so sad when our only punishment is that we which inflict on ourselves. We followers of Bollockism do not fear deat h, nor punishment, for they do not exist. There is only Love - the rest is illusion. To know this at a deep level is to be free from the fear that concedes cont rol to the Matrix and withou t which it cannot prevail.

Once we ta ke it seriously we become attached to the game through mind, emotion and fear. The Matrix only ex ists because we believe its illusions are real, bu t we don't have to. The mind-game has such a gr ip on reality that people get angry, obsessive or outraged about the most irrelevant bollocks and this myopia ceme nts their arses to the web. In fact, it's all bollocks. There is nothing, except Infini te Love, that isn't bollocks. But oh, my - how we get caught. For example, I made the point in I am me, I am free, about the word fuck. Oh my God, did he really say that? 'Ethel, he's just said that rude word, it's outrageous.' I love it how newspapers, moral guardians that they are, always write the word as f***. What the fu ck is that a ll about? When vou see f*** what goes through your mind? Fuc k, exactly. So it is morally OK to think fuck, but not to say it. What bollocks! Nothing encapsulates how deeply the Matrix has control of the human psyche than our attitudes to the word fuck. It may not be the mo st beautiful of sounds, but if you hit your thumb with a hammer I ch allenge you to find a be tter one to sum up your feelings. Like all words it can be said with venom , matter-of-factly, or in humour and it is the energy a nd intent behind a word that has the effect, not the word itself. Fuck is just a sound that can produce a disrup tive or harmonious resonance depending on the inte nt. So what's the big deal about this word when the same is true of all the others? Once again it's programming. We are told from childhood that the word is taboo and this imprint dict ates the lifetime reaction in most people when they hear the dreaded fo ur letters. To say se xual intercourse is fine, though not encouraged because even that's embarra ssing to many, but its one syllable stablemate is definitely persona non grata. Yet imagine if fuck meant something else, say sandwich. Two pieces of bread with something in th e middle is believed to be named after the fourth Earl of Sandwich because, it is said, in about 1762 he asked for meat to be served between slices of bread to avoid interrupting a gambling game.

No one's been hit by a lighting strike or a cruise missile? It's just a fucking word and we are Infi nite Consciousness - All Possibility. Jeeeez.

"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"167 Sex is another of the moral stickies that keeps people attached to the illusion. I saw an American right-wing Christian say that he was worried about gay marriage and wanted Bush elected to stop it. He wa s worried about gay marriage? Well, I think I see a way out of this: don't marry a gay, then. There, simple , what shall we do now? I am tempted to start an Inte rnet advice column and call it noneofyourbloodybusin ess.com. What right has anyone to decide if a gay marries a gay? It's their business and what th e hell are we doing moralising about relationships never mind legislating for them? Whether you are gay or what they call 'straight' it is only a software program transmitted from and through the DNA/RNA. Infinite Consciousness is All Po ssibility, the balance of everything, and it doesn't have our version of 'sex' in its non-Matrix form. The super-hologram is where 'physical' sex takes pla ce and gay or straight it does n't matter. They are both expressions of duality, as is al l that male-female stuff. It only happens in the realms of illusion and division. From the perspective we are disc ussing here, the sexual act, whether between 'straights' or 'gays', i nvolves inserting a holographic illusion into a holographic illusion and our central pr ocessing unit telling us if we are enjoying it or not. 'Willy to brain, are you receiving me?' 'Loud and clear, Will y, just worried about premature ejacula ... oh, th ere you go.' I know I should be taking this more seriously because I heard a sex therapist on the TV talking at length ab out this 'serious problem'. What baloney. Premature ejaculation is caused by fear of premature ejaculation an d the fear of not giving a 'good performance'. Someone asked me if I was good in bed and I said I didn't know because I am asleep at the time. Mayb e I should fix up a ca mera to find out. This 'being good' business m eans getting your partner's body computer to agree that you are good. If you can do that you are macho and, in the tabloid jargon, a 'great lover'. This is don't-scare-the-child ren speak for being gr eat at sex, by the way, and should not be confus ed with being a great expr esser of love. Sex that involves consciousness can be an awakening experien ce and infuse non-Matrix energy into the DNA, but an obsession with sex of me rely the body-to-body kind can lock you deeper in the Matrix because it is only a meeting of DNA and central processing units. It's like li nking a PC to a laptop so they can exchange information. I say, what a pair of portals on that one. There's nothing wrong with connecting computers and it can be entertaining, just like body-se x can be. It is not a matter of right and wrong, but of underst anding what is happening so we dictate events and not the software. When the Matrix wants us to focus on something it must be important for control and this is true of the obsessi on with sex. Without sex many tabloids would be leaflets. I am waiting for Who's Who to publish a new edition called Who's Having Who because from what I can see they would sell out. There is an obsession with 'celebrity' sex that appears to be fa r more important than what the 'celebs' actually do. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"168 'I think that woman's a great actress.' 'Really? What movies has she made?' 'I can't remember, but I know she' s had it off with Ryan O'Neal.' Sex sells newspapers along with the explos ion of 'celebrity' magazines and, most importantly, it sells the Matri x. The sex drive comes from th e reptilian brain, as does the interest in celebrity gossip. Robert F. Ke nnedy Jr, author of Crimes Against Nature (HarperCollins, New York, 2004), said of the media: 'They're airing stories that appeal to the prurient interests that all of us have in the rept ilian core of our brain for sex and celebrity gossip, and now for terr or'. Once again, this is no coincidence. There are calculated motives behind th e selling and, perversely enough, the suppression of sex. Anything that holds focus in the five senses is of fundamental service to the Matrix and nothing does this mo re effectively than sex because it is an extremely powerful five-sen se experience exchanging me ssages between the cells and brain. The desire for sex, which occupi es people for far lo nger than the act itself, operates in the same way. Sexu al fantasy makes you aroused simply by thinking of the experience. If you think of something that turns yo u on, your body will begin to react as if you were in a sexual situation. They talk about drugs and alcohol as addictions, but for many so is se x. In these cases th ey don't have sex - sex has them. It can grip them every bit as much as othe r addictions an d hold them in five-sense reality. None of this is a problem so long as you know that the 'physical' is illusion because then you can enjoy it without getting ca ught in the trap of believing it to be real. The Worship Your Willy Program is not onl y there to entice people to have endless sex; the game is more sub tle than that. Newspapers and magazines are obsessed with the sex lives of the rich and famous few but, at the same time, they moralise about sex and make pe ople feel guilty about it. 'We ar e exposing how this celebrity had group sex with three women. Isn't it dis gusting?' Well, actual ly, as long as they were all in agreemen t, no it's not. This stuff is invariably written by moralising hypocrites who would love to have made it a foursome. The media is like the moral crusader who condemns pornographic videos while watching one after the other to confirm how terrible they are. They put sex in your face to sell papers while condemning 'immoral behaviour' and making you feel bad for doing the same, or even thinking about it. Anot her theme is that the celeb rities have mo ney, fame and sex with the beautiful people and, well, er, you don't. Y ou are just an onlooker in life and we have launched this celebrity magazine so you can pay us to peek at what you will never have and never be, OK, HELLO? See how inadequate you are? Success is fame, fort une and being a sexual icon. Doncha' just wish you didn't work down the laundry? This stimulation of envy and unfulfilled desire, especially the desire for sex, creates an ongoing frustration that can suppress the whole energy system of the body-mind-emotion network pr ocessed through the DNA/RNA. Frustration of any kind, not least sexual, can sc upper the flow and manifest as disease, depression and sexual obsession. The Roman Ca tholic Church insi sts that its priests don't have sex and the same church has a global proble m of priests using ch ildren for sex.

Writer Oscar Wilde said: 'The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself. Precisely, so long as you are no t imposing your will on someone else. Celebrity is the ne w religion with every genuine ly talented or cynically manufactured 'star' so ld as a Jesus Christ, albeit a fleeting one, to the pack of manipulated followers.

It's a brilliant form of mind control called marketing, or 'hype' for short. People queue for hours in the rain for a brief glimpse of some film star or singer in their one-night designer frocks that cost more than the drenched congregation in the pews behind the security fence will earn in mo nths. Performing so meone else's script in a credible way, or singing a good song well , can put you on the 'A' list of iconic ce lebrity. They are the new pantheon used, like the old one , to sell an illusion within an illusion, John Wayne was a military hero without ever fighting a ba ttle and, as we saw in California, a bodybuilder with the vocabulary of a three-year-old ca n be elected to political office simply because he grunted his way th rough some movies. The fact that he grunts his way thro ugh his political spe eches, as well, is irrelevant in the ashram of celebrity when 'We love Ar nie' is the only mantra in town. We are told what to look like, what to sa y, what to think, how to act, who to worship, what to strive fo r. Norms are our guiding shite. But we are Infinite Consciousness -All That Is. What are we doing playing Little Me-Big Arnie when there is only one Infinite I? The Matrix se eks to divide this infinite unity by every means possible. Observe the 'w orld' and you will see a b illion fault li nes designed to divide and rule. We have religions, races, nations, cl asses, income brackets, men and women, politics, ad infi nitum. The list is endle ss because new ones are being added all the time. This is essential to the Matrix beca use it depends on duality to manifest its vi bratory illusion a nd it must keep entrapped consciousness in a state of perceived division to stop it connecting in awareness with the One. Politics divides people all over the wo rld, and billions take it seriously when political office is the almost exclusive bastion of the corrupt, stupid or myopic. It's not a matter of who we should vote for, but why we should ev en bother when the system is so blatantly rigged. You wouldn' t let Boy Bush run a market stall without parental supervision and yet he's a two- term president who sends young men and women to kill and be killed while others of hi s mental age are at home playing with their Lego (Figure 83, overleaf).

What about their "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"170 wives, which one would be a better first lady? Do you think Kerry would be better on Iraq? And what about his record in Vietnam, do you think he was telling the truth, and what about Bush avoiding the draft Will you shut-the-fuck-up?! It's all bollocks. I give you Political Elections for Dummies, which, as you will gather from the title, is particularly aimed at anyone who voted for George W. Bush. Both candidates in US 'elections' (and other significant ones around the world including Britain ) are funded by the major Illuminati corporations and controlled by the same force. Global politics is just a game to fool the people (Figure 84). The money is handed over - well in excess of a billion dollars to Bush and Kerry in 2004 - and, in return, the pi per asks the payer what music he likes. Those who funded the Bush campaign in 20 00 have made incredible profits from the decision to invade Iraq by providing the weapons to destroy the country and the 'expertise' to 'rebuild' what their bombs had devastated. This includes that infamous duo: the Carlyle Group, fundamentally connect ed to father Bush, and Halliburton, the oil services giant headed by Dick Cheney until he left to become US vice-president and minder to the juvenile delinquent. The 'party' system of politics was designed by the Illuminati to make it easier to control. Instead of having to manipulat e hundreds of individuals making free decisions according to their own conscience, they only have to control the party hierarchies. In the UK, we have the 'Whip' system in which the party leadership tells it's Members of Parlia ment how they will vote ev ery day. If the MPs don't follow these orders their politi cal careers go no further, and yet they are supposed to be representing the people who voted them into offi ce, not the party dictatorship In fact, most bills that pa ss through Capitol Hill and th e parliaments of the world are not even read by the Congressmen, Sena tors and MPs before they vote them into law! American 'Anti-terrorist' legi slation that has destroyed fundamental freedoms since 9/11 had not been read by the voting fodder when they supported its introduction, as US Congressman, Ro n Paul, has pointed out. This party structure is perfect for the manipulators because all they have to do is control the leaders to dictate what policies the part y will support. The I lluminati make sure "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"171 they have their placemen in control of all the major political partie s (and many others) and this allows them to daily manipulate the 'democratic process'. What we staggeringly call 'democracy' is another word for dictatorship. In 2004, Bush and Kerry were both initiates of the Skull and Bones Society, an elite secret grouping for chosen ones from the Illuminati bloodline families. There are a few hundred initiates of the Skull and Bones Society alive at any one time and some 295 million Americans; but somehow this secret society managed to supply both candidates at a 'free' election. The Illuminati couldn't lose. Whatever the result they would have had their guy in the White House, and Bush and Kerry would have simply pursued the same course using different rhetoric to kid the people that they did have a choice. Both candidates were asked about their Skull and Bones membership in an interview on the Public Broadcasting Serv ice (PBS) and both refused to talk about it. Bush said it was 'too secret'. The interviewer let them get away with this ev asion when he should have asked them why two potential Presidents of the United States would not tell the people about their secret society backgrou nd because it was 'too secret'. What the hell did they mean it was secret and what were the implications for open government of this secrecy? But you can spot most American journalis ts and television 'news' presenters quite easily; they are the ones on their knees with their tongues sticking out preparing to lick. Terms like Republican and Democrat, Labour and Conservative, are masks on the same face. But, as in 2000, the man the Illu minati really wanted was George W. Bush because his so-called 'neocon' (fascist) controllers, who orch estrated the war on terror, had their networks in place throug hout the government and they were to be left there to complete the task of setting the world ab laze and dest roying America."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"172 So, for the second time, the vote was rigged for Bush, not least through electronic voting machines with no paper trail to pr ove the desired choice had been recorded. Just trust us, okay? The machines were provided by Bush-supporting corporations that also counted th e votes! Among them was Diebold Inc. of North Canton, Ohio. Its chief executive, Walden O'Dell, was a top fundraiser for the Bush campaign who wrote a year earlier that he was 'committe d to helping Ohio de liver its electoral votes to the president...

To be a stooge in this co rrupt farce, millio ns stood in line for up to seven hours for the 'democratic right' of making an irrelevant 'choice'. We also had the insane situation in the so-c alled 'beacon of democracy' of having the crucial election in Ohio run by Ken Blackwell, the secretar y of state, a co-chairman of Ohio's committee to elect George Bush! The same was the case in Florida with secretary of state Katherine Harris when a vote scam there gave Bush the presidency in 2000. The governor of Flor ida was Jeb Bush, th e idiot's brother. America is not even a democratic country, le t alone a free one, but still most of the electorate continue to take politics seriously. The power of manipulating th e reptilian brain is such that staggering numbers also legitimately voted for Bu sh in 2004 and they sure seemed to have figured it all out before heading for the polling bo oths. Bush had made decisions that slaughtered tens of thousands of Iraqi ci vilians and more than 1,000 troops, but Christians voted for him becau se he was 'pro-life'. He tr iggered chaos and violence around the world and remove d basic American freedoms, but half the electorate voted for him as the best man to prot ect them and their freedom. He is a womanising, coke-snor ting liar responsible for the d eath and suffering of millions and yet people voted for hi m to protect marriage and Am erican morality. He is an idiot with the intellect of a pea, but people voted for him as a 'wise leader'. He used his father's contacts to avoid the draft to Vietnam and, like his blueprint, John Wayne, has never seen a bulle t, let alone a missile, fired in anger. But tens of millions voted for him because he showed courage in sending others to die on their behalf. The greatest ir ony is that a vote fo r Bush was seen as a vote for American patriotism, when the Illu minati are using Bush to destroy America. World government and superpowers do not go t ogether because the superpower has the financial and military might to tell the globa l dictators where to shove it. What we are seeing is Bush being used to front a plan to exploit American troops and resources to advance the ag enda for global conquest while , in doing so, destroying the United States as a financ ial and military superpower. They want to engineer an eventual conflict with Chin a in pursuit of this goal. 'Yeah, but why do you think the people wanted Bush more than Kerry? Was it because Kerry's a liberal and soft on terror, or ...?' Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaahhhh!! Race is also a big player in the game of divide and rule. What we call 'races' are different software pr ograms.

Racism is like saying 'Google' is better than 'Yahoo'. I say there is no place in this world for Google supremacists, th e Yahoo caste system or anti-Spamitism. The divisions of race are illusions, but powe rful ones for the bi llions caught by the DNA. The appalling murder of Ken Bigley, th e British hostage beheaded in Iraq in 2004, provided a telling exam ple of what a sense of race and nation can do to incarnate Oneness. There were religious services of respect and remembrance, government announcements of deep regret, Tony Blair reading from the Bible, and even a minute's silence before a World Cup soccer match between England and Wales. I understand this because what Ke n suffered was unimaginable. But where is the outpouring of grief, the government statements of deep regret, religious services and a minute's silence for the now tens of thousands of Iraqis who have been killed and maimed as a result of the American and British invasion of that country? Are the children who have been blown apart or seen their parents, brothers and sisters scattered in pieces, not worthy of the sam e respect and response that followed the horrific killing of Ken Bigley? Why such a response for one Englishman, but not for all those dead Iraqi men, women and ch ildren, perhap s even 100,000 according to one study? A sense of race an d nationhood, that's why. Ke n was 'one of our own'. And that's it, you see. When the unders tanding is lost that we are all One and division is illusion, we forget that everyone and everything that exists is 'one of our own'. Instead, we are trapped in the Proud to be British Program and Proud to be American Program (available in all languages like the Proud to be German and Proud to be Iraqi Programs). Even these have subdivisions such as the Proud to be Texan or Proud to be a Londoner Programs. This software insists that people have to be born on the same illusory piece of land as we were if they are going to be considered 'one of us'. When you watch English professiona l football games you will see the home crowd hurling abuse at a player on the opposing side. But when that same player represents the national team the same people cheer him! These are different levels of the One of Us Program. Such software has been responsible for endless wars with the populations programmed with the 'us a nd them' mentality fuelled by fear and ignorance. It leads to all sides killing people they don't know, have never met and would probably get along fine with if they did. American and British troops have killed all those civilians in Iraq while Arab 'freedom fighters' have responded by be heading American and British civilians, along with others from countries not even involved in the invasion. The troops and the retaliators are the same software and so the same mentality, but they think they are different and on opposite 'sides'. The software sells the ludicrous idea that you can judge people by the colour of their skin or the shape of their body when all is the same one consciousness entrapped by illusion. If people like where they live or were born that's great so long as they know it's not real.

There was a massive Christian cross next to th e farmhouse and a guy was sitting alone nearby taking a break from a lecture. As we chatted, the extent of his bigotry became clear. From what I now know, I wo uld say he was definitely something out of Windows 95, maybe even an early protot ype. I asked him how he squared the idea of some long-lost American freedom with the treatment of the native peoples when the settlers arrived. He said that God had designated this land for white people and the 'Indians' were only keeping it fo r them till they a rrived. He, and his like, hanker for some mythical time when the United States was really free. Reality check: it never has been. Wa s it freedom when the Europeans arrived to slaughter the native population in a genocidal mass murder? Was it freedom to force them into poverty and starvation on reserva tions that were often little more than concentration camps? Was it freedom to coldly kill the buffalo simply to destroy the way of life of the native peoples and ma ke them dependent on you? Was it freedom to purposely give them smal lpox to kill as many as you could? Was it freedom to impose the Christian religion on them, and European settlers, through inquisition, violence and psycho logical fascism? There never has been a fr ee United States and ther e never will be until the population frees itself from the illusion of God Bless America, Land of the Free. 'How can you say that when it's the grea test country in the woooorld?' Bollocks. There are no countries. They are softwa re programs that only exist as signals decoded in the brain. They ar e illusions written into the program to divide, rule and delude us. You are not Amer ican, British, South Africa n, Mexican - any of them. You are Infinite Consciousness experienci ng a holographic illu sion designed to make you believe you are American, Br itish, South African or Mexican. By the way, some people th ink that when you expose th e centralisation of global power you must be a nationalistic flag-fli er. Well, some are, but the only good thing about flags for me is to tell you the wind direction. I watched an American cowboy show in which a John Wayne sound-a-like said: 'Look af ter your flag and your flag will look after you'. Given the dishevelled state of him I th ink his flag was in breach of contract. My challenge to global centralisation is about people having control over decisions that affect th em, not pulling up the ladder and repelling all boarders. Nationalism and global centralisation ar e two expressions of the same bollocks. There is a smaller version of these polaritie s known as parents and family. The parents invariably provide the centralisation of power and families, in general, operate on nationalis tic lines - 'We're family, we lo ok after our own'. Again, I can understand this, but it's s till illusion. The onl y difference betw een a parent and child is the point where they entered the DVD/movie. The ones that entered at point A become the parents of those who enter a few scenes do wn the disk. They are parents only because they combined their DNA software to provide the holograms for others to expe rience the Time Loop.

You can feel an empathy and conn ection to someone you have known for ten minutes th at you will often never expe rience in a lifetime of trying with parents and siblin gs. This connection can happen within families, but it doesn't have to, as we see in so many cases. Even then, it is not the illusory holographic 'family' that is behind the connection, but the consciousness directing the software we call the family. It can also be that the DNA (body-mind-emotions) is programmed to be attracted to another program for a mutual experience in the Reincarnation-Karma il lusion, but this is a different level of connection, often more a marriage of convenie nce than Infinite Oneness. I l ove being with my family and seeing them develop and I'm not for a moment saying that people shouldn't operate as a family unit if th at is what they choose. We simply need to understand what a family really is and then we can enjoy the experience (or walk away) without the illusion contro lling us. If we don't have this understanding, families can be a nightmare that haunts us for a lifetime. Many parents seem to believe that they have the right to tell their children how to think, what to believe and how they should live their illusory lives. The arrogance of it never ceases to stagger me. I saw in that Jewish Law television series how children are brought up from birth to follow the strict and extreme beliefs of their parents. A boy's hair is not cut until he is three because Jews are commanded not to touch the fruit of th e tree until the third year. At that point comes the ceremonial cutting of the hair, leaving the 'sacred side lock s', and from this time he has to wear the Jewish cap. He is three and has no say in what religion, if any, he wants to follow. It is the same with Jewish babies circumcised only because religious law demands it, and Christian babies baptised into the church without any choice in the matter. The day after th e hair-cutting ceremony (the Sikhs must be aghast) the Jewish toddler is taken to school to be taug ht the Hebrew alphabet. The shorn lad in the documentary looked tota lly bewildered at what was going on, but he had seen nothing yet. A lifetime of follo wing the letter of th e Torah awaited him. Even the way children get out of bed is governed by the dictates of Jewish law. They have to dress from the top down with the right side clothed before the left. The kids are programmed with robotic behaviour from th e earliest of ages. They have to put on the skullcap the moment they wa ke, and a bowl of water is brought for them to wash their hands. Rabbi Dovid Jaffe explained that the hands have to be washed immediately because 'they might ha ve touched areas in the night which are spiritually unclean'. Th is is what is known to others as 'scratching the bollocks'. If God made bollocks, how can they be spirit ually unclean? Girls an d boys officially become adults in orthodox Jewish law at 12 and 13 respectivel y, when they become responsible for all their deeds, not their parents. From this moment they are not allowed to touch a member of the opposite sex until they get married, not even their brothers or sisters. One mother told us how difficult it could be to avoid contact when receiving change in a sh op. The trick was, she said, to hold your hand lower so the change could be dropped in. Wh y are they doing dumping this nonsense on kids of 12 and 13? Happy Bar Mitzvah, my boy, welcome to a lifetime of fear and suppression.

Who are these pe ople to tell their children what they will believe without giving them any choice or access to other possibiliti es? Can you imagine advocates of the Jewish faith encouraging their children to look at Christianity, Buddhism or this book before deciding if they want to follow the endless laws of Judaism that will dictate every aspect of their lives? Not a chance. Neither would Christian parents in relation to Judaism and other beliefs. No, your parents are Christian or Jewish and so you children will go to ch urch or the synagogue and wear this cross or that hat. There has to be parental guidance for children to protect them from harm, but that is not the same as telling them what to believe and forcing your program on their reality. None of my childr en have followed a religion, but if that was their choice good luck to them. It's their life, not mine. If young people want to be free they ne ed to be strong enough to decide for themselves what to believe; they need to reject the download and not allow their parents or peer pressure to batter them in to submission. Parents can be expert in playing the guilt card and making you feel bad because y ou don't do what they say or desire. If you want to be free, don't fall for that ol d mind game. If parents can't respect their children's right to freedom of belief then sod 'em, I say. They concede their right to be taken seriously. There are many fantastic pa rents who allow their children to develop without pressure a nd imposition, and many others who go the other way and couldn't care le ss about what happens to th eir kids, never mind offer guidance and support. Whicheve r type we have it is up to us to follow our hearts and not any parental bluepr int downloaded into our r eality. I can understand why people go through their entire lives fee ling guilty about not living up to their parents' expectations, or are resentful at the way their parent s treated them. But, hey, I bring you glad tidi ngs of great joy here. It's all bollocks. In fact , there are no parents, only holo graphic illusions we ca ll 'family'. It is co nsciousness, not family, that connects us. Let us not forget, either, th at the pendulum swings bo th ways. Children can also impose their will on th eir parents and use th eir own pack of guilt trips. 'Oh mother, you shouldn't be doing that at your age, it's embarrassing.' Well, piss off then and spare your embarrassment, th e door is over there. Pa rents agonise over not being around for their children because circumst ances prevent it. But we are Infinite Oneness; we are the 'parents' and the 'c hildren', and the division and 'space' in between us are more illusion. I know how hard it can be to live that awareness, but only when we express love without irrelevant attachment can th e freedom-bell ring. Parental pressure is often connected to a major piece of software called the You Must Make Something of Your Life Program. This means 'succeeding' in ways that the system - and people programmed by the sy stem - say constitu tes success. This relates overwhelmingly to one of two things , usually both: status and money. We see the status software in what we call celebrity, but it extend s to all the jobs and titles that make us a 'success' in the system's te rms.

Why wouldn't the system - the Matrix - want people to aspire to the roles that most serve it? It is no accident whatsoever that the occupations deemed most 'successful' are those that most serve the system. But this success business is worth a closer look: Presidents and prime ministers are puppets of forces dictating their decisions and, in the case of George W. Bush, and ma ny others, it's clear that a moron can be 'successful' by reaching the 'highest offi ce'. He may be called President of the United States, but he is still a moron.

These ensure that the system's will invariably pr evails and those that can be most trusted to reach the 'correct' decision will always get the high-profile cases that the system most wants to win. They are system-fodder, like politicians, and many are deeply corrupt within a fundamentally corrupt 'legal' cesspit. Is that really success? Police officers play the same role, enforcing laws to impose the system's will and defending it from challenge. Even the many genuine ones are forced to conform or they're out. Police officers do n't primarily serve the people, they serve the system, with honourable exceptions. It is the sy stem that pays them and, through their uniform or warrant card, gives them the power over others th at so many crave. Is that really success? The military fight wars and invade countri es in line with the system's agenda while selling this insane human slaughter to themselves and the people as 'defending freedom'.

So the most successful people in these symbols of success are those who serve the sy stem most slavishly. This is by design, not default. Whenever 'success' is being calculated, money will be in the mix somewhere, often right out in front. Ne wspapers and magazines blitz us with reports of how rich people are, as if this was a measure of anything. It's not even a measure of how much money they have because there is no money - only recycled debt. If there is no money how can anyone have money or owe money? A guy ma y be an arsehole, but he's a billionaire arsehole so that gives him status. Why? Often it's the very fact that he's an arse hole that made him a billionaire because of the ruthlessness necessary to acquire all that debt, sorry 'money'. The pursuit of status, power and control through money has made people slaves to its illusions. It has distorted our reality and tethered us to the system through both the desire for success and the desperation to survive. You can work with enormous dedication to help people, or make a profound contribution to human understanding, and earn very little. But vou can make a fortune simp ly by buying and selling a house while doing nothing except living there or leaving it empty until the market goes up. 'I say, Bill and Ethel have made £200,000.' 'Wow, that's successful ; what did they do?' 'They lived in their house.' 'And...?' 'That's it.' Even this is often more illu sion because if you want to buy another house, they are all more expensive, too. All this do es is make fortunes for speculators and increase the cost of a basic human right - a home - for ev eryone else. This is great for the Matrix because it mean s you have to work for long er to earn the 'money' for a home and serve the system even more unq uestioningly. While I was writing this chapter the news in Britain was full of stories about a 'pensi on crisis' and how millions are going to live in poverty when they retire because they haven't paid enough into a pension all their working live s. People as youn g as 40 are now worrying about what is going to happen to them 25 years hence. Fear of the future is the biggest fear of all and includes the fear of 'dea th'. That is what this pension 'crisis' is really all about - generating fear . It is being proposed th at people be forced to pay up to 15 per cent and mo re of their income into a pension scheme and fear is being used to sell the idea. The real motive is to prov ide an enormous inflow of fictitious funds to the Illumina ti insurance companies who in vest it in line with the Illuminati agenda. Those who control th e banks are the same people who control the insurance companies and the same people who control government taxation. The whole economic system is a magic-s how with the same ma gician in control. 'Money' is only fi gures moving around computer sc reens and we ca n create as much or as little as we ch oose.

The Illuminati have hijacked the mean s of exchange by in troducing the money fraud. As a result, they have hijacked the dreams of th e people - which are largely related to the need for money to achieve wh at they want, or ha ve money as the end in itself. One of the main reasons the Illuminati have targeted the formerly self- sufficient 'Third World' countr ies is to destroy their self-sufficiency and make them dependent on money. Once ach ieved, he who controls the money controls the country and its people through dependency on their means of worthless exchange. What's more, we are urged to pursue the god they call 'economic growth'. We are supposed to cheer when they announce a rise in eco nomic growth because that means the country is 'doing well'. But economic growth is merely the amount of money changing hands for g oods and services. That's al l it is. When someone is admitted to hospital or when an oil tanke r pollutes a coastline they are adding to economic growth because they involve mo ney being spent. A war adds massively to economic growth for the sa me reason, as we can see with the hundreds of billions spent by the US milita ry alone. On the one hand we say illness, pollution and war are highly undesirable, but on the other th e system's balance-sheet records them as economic success! 'Money', the stockmarket casinos, a nd economic growth are all expressions of the same bollocks. Much of the clamber for sy stem-style success is motiv ated by insecurity and a need to be recognis ed for achievement. Such is the way the system undermines self- confidence that people find it extremely difficult to find security from within. They must have confirmation they are adequate or successful by others telling them so. For this to happen, given th e perception of success, they have to achieve according to the system's rules. Children are prime target s for this programming, pa rticularly the so-called 'tweenies', or 'tweens', aged between eight and twelve. 'Get th em young and keep them for life' is the system's motto. A BBC Panorama documentary in November 2004 highlighted the 'tweenie ' obsession with brand-labe l clothing produced by the Illuminati transnationals. These compan ies make fantastic profits often by producing their clothes in sweatshops in th e poorest countries and shipping them to the West to sell at top- notch prices. This is called 'free trade', by the way. The marketing and brainwashing is such that children now apparently have a term for kids who don't wear brand clothing. They are called a 'Niki- no-name'. One nine- year-old said in the docu mentary that if she was not allowed brand names she would 'refuse to wear my cl othes and ... just stay in my pyjamas'. She added that she hated being called a Tittle girl' because 'it reminds me of my childhood' and she revealed the tragic extent to which so many young children have submitted to the hive mentality: 'If I see someone wearing something, like for example, a poncho, if I like it I'll count it as one ... When I get to five or six [people in a poncho], that's when I think I've got to ha ve it'. A 12- year-old asked how hi s attitude to brand clothing could be called an obsession when every other kid of his age was like that. This same boy stressed that he did not buy the latest trends because he would be a sheep and look like everyone else. But then he revealed how he only shopped at a "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"181 certain brand-label clothes store! Mary Macleod of the UK National Family and Parenting Institute made an astute observation: 'Children may think that they are ma king choices when actually they have been captured by a choice. They have been capt ured by an identity rather than being able to discover their own identity. So there are a range of identities offered to them and they have to slot into one.' Exactly. And it's the same with adults. There is no greater way to manipulate someone than to make them believe they are making th e choice when, in fact, you are. It gives them a sense of being in c ontrol when they're not and, as I have said many times, people don't rebel about not be ing free when they think they are. The nine-year-old in the Panorama programme told how the Niki-no-name children were bullied and picked on fo r not wearing brand clothe s. Asked what she would do if a friend did not wear br and names, she said: 'I woul d still be thei r friend, but I wouldn't hang around with them so much because you are going to get bullied with them'. One parent had th e answer to this lunacy - give in to the system: 'If they are getting hassle for something that ca n be solved so easy by buying the right pair of trainers - buy the right pair of trainers. Why ever have it as an issue?' It took a 12-year-old schooled at home to introduce so me sanity to this madness. Imogen Donaldson did not want to w ear famous brand labels a nd she pointed out that we are not what we wear or ho w much money we have. She sa id she had only been in schools on rare oc casions and she found them 'lifeless, a bit like a prison'. This is what they are and they provide an enviro nment for peer pressure to dominate and indoctrinate. Imogen, free from this envi ronment, was able to see clearly what brand names really represent: 'It's as if someone owns you. The original word came from a long pole with a logo on the end that was burned into a cow's side and showed the farmer owned them. So just having the company's name across the top shows that they own you or something.' The Illuminati network sees the population in exactly those term s - as cattle. It markets pop singers, like Br itney Spears, that it believ es will best influence the tweenies, and the kids down load the image to which they are manipulated to aspire. This includes kitting out the pop ic ons in the designer brand names, just as they do with sports stars, because th ey know the programmed tweenies will demand to wear the same. It is an indica tion of how far the programming has gone when you think that people once used to be paid to go round the streets wearing sandwich boards that advertised a shop or business. Now people pay the highest prices for the privilege of being a sandwich board for Nike, Boss or Ralph Lauren and kids are given a hard time if they don't, or can't, do the same. Yet again it is seeking success on the system's terms for the system's benefit. 'M y tee-shirt says \"Armani\" on the front, so I've made it! Your s says nothing - you're a failure.'

When you see these P op Idol shows on te levision, and their burgeoning offshoots, there are thousands of people willing to undergo the most horrendous ridicule for the faintest chan ce that they will beco me a 'star'. What agony they go through waiting for some 'celebrity' judge li ke Simon Cowell to decree their fate and what relief and gratitude follows their progress to the next stage of their exploitation. 'Oh, thank you Simon; I'm so gratef ul Simon.' I'm not having a go at Cowell as a pe rson, he may or may not be a very nice chap behind his cultivated image, but the way he is s een by wannabe 'stars ' encapsulates how the system controls us throu gh a desire to succeed on its terms. Fame is such a drug because the sense of securi ty comes from without, not within, and has to be constantly fed. This is not always the case and there are exceptio ns to everything I am saying, but it is a common theme. Pe ople look to others to tell them how wonderful they are a nd many of the most famous and lauded actors and singers are the most insecure of personalities. System -dictated success is their emotional crutch. Once we fall for this one we are handing contro l of our lives to those we seek to impress. Whatever we think will impress or attract the 'r ight people', that is what we do. Soon we don't know who 'we' are anymore beca use the painted personality has taken over. Why do we have to impre ss anyone? Bollocks to Simon Cowell and the millions of other self-app ointed judges throughout so ciety that we concede our power to. You are already a star because you are the Infinite One, All That Is and Ever Can Be. Are we really saying that the In finite has to impres s a hologram called Simon Cowell or an yone else? Are you kidding? The Infinite - YOU - doesn't have to succeed by being a presid ent, lawyer, judge, pop star or anything else. You are everything, including Simon Cowell and all the other illusions th at people think they have to impress - the boss, kids at school, parents, teachers, sports coaches, the public in general.

Simon Cowell is considered a success because of the Status Through Fame and Money Program. Why is he thought more successful than a road cleaner or refuse collector? Which one would yo u miss most if they didn 't report for work for a month: the guy taking your trash away on a truck or the guy bringing it to you on a TV screen? The reason the refu se collector is not considered a success is the reverse of what makes Cowell a 'star'. He lacks status because he la cks fame and money. But status is so illusory a nd irrelevant because it depends on a j ob title and/ or what the system designates as status. One day you can have power and status and the next you retire and it's all gone. It wasn 't you who had the power and status, but the job title owned by the system. So it is with people in un iform. They don't have the power - the uniform does. We have allowed the illusions of the Ma trix to distort our values, perceptions and even our dreams .

Vital to this realisation is no t to get caught in the subplots, the diversions.

Yes, and even the Illuminati conspiracy. It is important to know how we are being manipulated on the five -sense level, but if we leave it there we won't see the true nature of the trap we are caught in. If we get too focused on the subplots we won't see the movie. The Matrix is a web of flytraps to keep us in the illusion an d the way out is to stop identifying with it. That means to change ou r perception of self from the hologram, with its name and sense of limi tation, and know that we are Infinite Consciousness.

It is this program that frets about people saying 'fuck', having gay relati onships or winning Pop Idol.

What we believe, and how we perceive ourselves, can either hold us in servitude or set us free. If you identify with your name and your body you will have thoughts and emotions that relate to limitation. Try it an d you'll see. It has to be that way because the whole foundation of the DNA program is to project an illusory holographic world based on rules and, by thei r very nature, rules always mean limitation. It has its 'solid' walls, laws of ph ysics, illness, ageing, cycle of birth and death, and endless lists of reas ons why something can' t be done. It is the realm where but is king. I'd like to do this, but, ... I'd like to go here, but, ... I'd lik e to heal myself, but ... The Matrix is feeding us the 'but' mentality through our DNA and when we falsely identify with that program our consciousness be comes enslaved by illusion. It's fascinating to sit quietly while you listen to your thoughts and feel your emotions in a way that makes you the obs erver and not the e xperiencer of them. Normally we operate as if we are our thoughts and emotions, and we identify them with who we are. We see them as our 'p ersonality'. According to hyperdictionary.com, the definition of 'personality' is: 'The complex of all the attributes - behavioral, temperamental, emotional and mental - that characterize a unique individual'. What that describes is different versions of th e DNA software as read by the RNA, or what are known to psychologists as archetypes. There are no unique individuals because we are all One and, even if you relate the defin ition only to this reality, there are still no unique people unless consciousness - Infinite Possibility - is i nvolved. 'Behavioral, temperamental, emotional and mental' ar e all expressions of the program - the archetypes - and only consciousness can provi de uniqueness as we perceive it. What makes us 'human', as opposed to In finite Consciousness, is the program. We misunderstand what emotions are an d therefore identify with them. We relate emotion to love and caring, but it is a false asso ciation. 'Love' and 'emotion' 184 U"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"185 are not the same thing, and nor does emotion have anything to do with empathy. Love, in its true sense, is Oneness and within the bala nce of Oneness there is no emotion in the way we experien ce it in the illusion. There is only the joy, bliss and love that come with unity. Emotion is a part, not a whole. Empathy comes from Oneness, because only through that can we fully conn ect with another expression of the One. Emotion is not love or empathy; it is a series of programmed reactions and they are constantly being manipulated. If you find that quiet spot and listen to your thoughts and emotions, rather than identifying with them, you will realise they are not you. It is important to the experience not to respond or react to what you hear and fe el as they glide by. Just observe them, unattached from whatever they are prattling on about, and certainly don't judge them or they will pull you in. In the end it's lik e listening to the radio. It is said that we are not our thoughts, we ar e the silence between th em, and it is from this level of consciousness that we can detach from th e program. When you observe vour thoughts and emotions, the chatterbox in your head that never seems to shut up, you can experience the truth of that. Th e silence is your consciousness; the chatter is your program. C onsciousness is silent becaus e it has nothing to say. It doesn't think, it knows, and knowing doesn't need to constantly wa ffle on trying to work things out. Nor is it fo rever worrying about the 'future' or regretting the 'past' - the major source of mental and emotional discourse. In stark contrast to mind and emotion, consciousness is real chilled. It can be funny to observe how our thoughts and em otions react to daily life. They can be stunningly dum b and dominated by fear. From the observat ion point of consciousness their reactions become so predictable an d their programmed nature so obvious. I mentioned ear lier about people in relati onships who play emotional pinball with first one reacting and then the other. This can cause terrific conflict, and the cycle can only be broken when the couple stops reacti ng according to DNA program. Until that happens the rider is being ridden by the horse. When we stop reacting to program all that remains is consciousness and cons ciousness can tell the RNA 'laser' to read 'physical' reality in a different way. The so ftware is all about reacting; it's what the Matrix wants us to do. When we react we identify with the program and consciousness chases the white rabbit. In doing so, its state of being mirrors the thoughts and em otions it believes to be its own and generates the energy that feeds the Matrix. Once you realis e that your programmed reactions are not you there will be far more harmony a nd peace in your lif e. There are still moments when the program w ill con you into r eacting, but the mo re you express consciousness the less this will happen and the quicker you will apply the brake when it does. As you log off from the so ftware and log on to consci ousness, you will develop a spontaneity you never had before. This is the worst nightmare for the Matrix because it is a manife station in this real ity of Infinite Poss ibility. Some of the Illuminati's own documents say that mavericks (spontaneous people) are the biggest threat to their plan s.

But what will people think? Just doooo it. Or even better just beeee it. How many times have you wanted to do so mething in the moment and then had your spontaneity mugged by thoughts and emotions listing all the reasons why you shouldn't? By the time you have proc essed it all, the spont aneity has already been extinguished by a programmed fire hose called 'can't', 'mustn't', 'guilt' and 'what if? Spontaneity does not operate within such rules or it cannot be what it claims to be. This also means to allow others to be spontaneous without imposing rules upon them. If you are obsessed with, or intimidated by, rule s the Matrix has you. The people who say 'rules is rules', and enfo rce them without taking circumstances into account are spontaneity-free zones, carousel horses devoid of a rider. They often become government officials, car-park atte ndants, traffic wardens, security staff, police officers and many others with a rule -book reality that dictates their every thought. They are like speed cameras in uniform, unable to figure out that not every situation should be tr eated the same. This is the reptilian brain at work again. I had a guy press the doorbell one time who ha d come to do a routine five-minute inspection of the flat I was renting. His ag ency had done this every few months for years on behalf of th e owners. He only had to walk a very short distance from his office, but when I said Pam was ill in bed and could he come back another day, he insisted that if he couldn't come in I would be charged a £30 fee. He said that this was the day he told us he was coming an d there could be no exceptions in his programmed mind. When I ob serve such people I can se e their circuit board being read and the RNA pressing 'e nter'. They are computers. Have you ever seen a co mputer being spontaneous unless its system is buggered? When you click on 'Google' that is where th e computer takes you. It follows the rulebook. It doesn' t say, 'sod that, I'm o ff to AOL, tough shit '. It acts like a computer program because that is wh at it is and it's the same with the 'rulebookers' in uniform, the Windows 95s. Spontaneity overrides the program because it is an expression of consciousness - In finite Love. When a computer goes haywire and refuses to follo w instructions it could be symbolically perceived as mentally ill and programmed people can s ee spontaneous behaviour in the same way. They don't understand it because it does n't fit with the progr am that controls them. There is a great line in one of the Matrix movies where the Merovingian character says: 'It is remarkab le how similar the pa ttern of love is to the pattern of insanity'. So it is, at least as perceived. Lo ve in its true sense is All Possibility and that can be seen as craz y to programmed limitation. All this is not to say that we should go so far as spontaneou sly jumping from the Eiffel Tower. It is possible to do that and be okay because everything is an illusory reality, but we will only su rvive such 'miracles' when we are so disconnected from the program that our reality is no longer subject to its basi c 'rules' like gravity. This was well illustrated in the first Matrix movie when Morpheus was able to leap between the buildings in th e computer program while Neo fell on his face.

There are other ways to jump from the tower without doing it 'physically'. You can jump from a job you can't stand and pursue your dream without fear of losing your 'security'. You can do what you feel is right without letting fear of the consequences stop you. You can cease to allow the fear of what other people think decide your experience. All these are examples of consciousness disconnecting from mind and emotions and overriding the program. The 'world' you are afraid of only exists in your head and you can change it any time you want by chan ging your sense of reality. You are Infinite Possibility and you can manifest anything if you don't let the T can't' program control you. I have been saying in my books that we need to think for ourselves and that is the start of the process that leads to infinite freedom. It is, however, only the start. The next stage is to stop thinking at all. But that's crazy, Dave. How can we live without thinking? In fact, we can't truly liv e if we do. Thinking comes from 'mind' and mind is the program. Mind thinks, consciousness knows. I can only go so far with this while using language because it is something people have to experience to fully understand. Everything I have said in this book has been subject to the same limitation of the language available and ther e is far more to know than I have been able to portray in words, and far more that I have yet to access. It is the same with the chasm of difference between thinking and knowing. I would put it this way: if vou have to think about something, it's the Matrix. 'Now let me think' ..., Til think about it' ..., 'Hold on, I'm thinking' . .., are all the program at work. When consciousness overrides the software we just know. If you seek answers, the Matrix has you. By seeking answers you must be asking questions and therefore you are not operating as Oneness - the All-Knowing. When you access that level of awareness, there is an answer to everything, so long as you don't ask the question. Or, looking from another angle, there are no answers because there are no questions. There is only knowing because we are accessing the AZZ-Knowing Infinite One (Figure 85, overleaf). When faced with a situation, you don't think about what to do, you know. When trying to understand how things are, you don't think and try to work it out, you know. When you are connecting in awareness with the All-Knowing, how can you not know? To achieve this state of knowing does not require us to learn anything or go anywhere. We have nothing to learn and we are everywhere. 'I'd like a ticket to everywhere, please.' 'Sorry, sir, you can't go becau se you've already arrived.' We don't need to learn, we need to unlearn what the program has manipulated us to believe. Mind is not the road to enlightenment; it is the barrier to it. Knowledge and knowing is not the same thing - one is mind, the other consciousness. We don't need to learn, but to awaken from the hypnotic trance and remember who we are. When we do, we cease to think and start to know. Some call this intuition or 'following the heart' and it comes from a far more aware level of consciousness than is usually at large in this reality. Knowing is the decision-making arm of spontaneity.

This reluctance to accept the magnitude and in finity of who we are is the biggest block to reaching a stat e of knowing. We have in tuitive knowing and then immediately begin to do ubt it. That is the pr ogram kicking in to protect its control. One of the phrases you hear is: 'You have a lot to learn'. But we don't. We only think we do. To accept that we have to learn is to accept we are not All-Knowing, and to accept this means to accept we are not Onen ess. How can the All think small? Only when the Matrix has you. Vital to ditching 'Little Me' is to replace self-loathing with self-love. The system wants you to feel bad about yourself, to be consumed by guilt and regret, and to see yourself as insignificant, a loser in the game of life. It lays do wn blueprints for what is a 'success' or 'failure', a 'good parent', 'good husband', 'good wife', 'good this', or 'good that'. And it wags its finger if you don't measure up. If you accept the system's version of reality it holds you in a low vi brational emotional state where the Matrix makes the rules. Religion has done a magnificent job of making people loath themselves. The sinner mentality is in th e DNA programming and affects even those who reject the religions that put it there. But we can disconne ct from this genetic self- abuse. You are not your mind or emotions, your 'personality'; you are Infinite Love. That doesn't mean Infinite Love for ever ything except 'you'. How can you reconnect with Infinite Love while you consciously or subconsciously despise yourself?? What you have done or not done, said or not said, is irrelevant . You were caught in the program while thinking it wa s you. Now you can drop the disguise and love what you really are - Love. And wh y can't you love your programmed 'p ersonality', too? After all, that is also Infi nite Love; it's just that it doe sn't know. Love and forgiveness for self and others, including the programmed manipulators, deletes the software that stimulates the guilt and hatred wh ich holds us in illusory separation. Once you realise that the wo rld is illusion and the body is a software program manipulated to ensnar e consciousness, you can play w ith reality and have fun with it. I have been asked many ti mes if it is possible to make money or follow this or that career without being caught in the game. Yes it is, so long as you know it's a game and not real - although once you acc ess consciousness this whole 'career' obsession is seen in a differe nt light. I am not telling people they sh ould sit on a mountain top and ponder every day on the nature of Oneness. Illusions control us when we think they're real, an d to know it's an illusion is to breach that control. As I showed with the subliminal advertisements in Tales from the Time Loop, once you can see the manipulation it ceases to have power. When you lo ok at a subliminal message in a picture it can talk to your subconscious without you being aware of its existence. But when the hidden message is pointed out yo u see it clearly every time you look. The illusion is like that. Once you are aware of the game, it loses its control. If people want to pursue a career and make lo ts of non-existent money, go ahead. But they should know that it doesn't matter if they do and it doesn't matter if they don't becaus e both are illusion. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"190 I'll give you an example of what I mean about playi ng with the game and being trapped by it. Sport is a major global ente rtainment and that's fi ne so long as we don't believe it matters. I love watching fo otball, what American s call soccer, and coaching my young son, Jaymie , who is a brilliant goalkeepe r. I have a few teams I like to see win, but if they don't, so what? I know it's illusion, albeit to me an entertaining one. Jaymie would like to become a profession al footballer, but if he does or he doesn't he will not have su cceeded or failed - both are holographic illusions and he'll be Infinite Oneness eith er way. If you think in terms of success and failure the Matrix has you. However, football, and other sports, can be experienced very differently when you thin k the illusion is real. How the team they support is doing becomes ever ything to some fans and a ffects their whole life. They go into anger or depression when the team loses and the hatred between many supporters of rival teams is extraordinary to me. They live their lives through their football club and their own sense of succes s and failure is measured by how well the team is doing. The Matrix has them because they believe it's real and the outcome matters. It is yet another illusion within the illusion; another subplot; a hologram within the super-hologram. This attitude to sport mirrors the way the I Am Human Program views life in general. Attachments chain us to the Matr ix: attachment to people, status, race, nation, religion, money and, the biggest of th em all, attachme nt to outcome. Nothing suffocates freedom and peace more th an this. If, like sp orts fans, you attach yourself to 'your team' wi nning, you are setting yourse lf up for disappointment because the only way to avoid that is fo r 'your team' to wi n. Any other outcome guarantees disappointment and frustrati on. But if you enjoy the game without attachment to the result, the outcome w ill not produce emotiona l upset and trauma because you weren't attached to a speci fic scenario. You may have preferred a certain outcome, but you were not attached to it emotiona lly. Once again, it is the same with 'life'. What keeps us in the illusi on more than anything is our identification with polarity. The Matrix depends for its very existence on the duality that divides Oneness, at least in our sense of realit y, and creates the pole s between which the world of vibration can resonate. This can be seen in DNA with its two strands and in the two halves of the br ain. Everywhere you see the polarities of light and dark, negative and positive, left and right, male and female, right and wrong, good and bad, for and against. This entire reality is based on polarity. When we accept this as real, and who we are, we disconnect from the cons ciousness of the One in awareness of itself. There are no polarities in Oneness and so no vibration. There is only one One and it ha s nothing with which to resona te. If you identify with a polarity - I am a man, woman, British, Amer ican, on the Left or Right and all the rest - the Matrix has you. Infinite Consciousness ob serving through a fe male hologram doe s not make you a woman. It is the program that does that . You can identify with being Infinite Consciousness having an experience without falling for the trap that you are your body or your experience. To the Matrix, women fighting fo r their rights is just as"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"191 important as men seek ing to deny them because it cr eates polarities. The Left in politics is as vital as the Ri ght for the same reason, and so on. If we id entify with a polarity we create the other. A belief in the 'Light' means that you must believe in the 'Dark' or you would not have to call it 'Light'. It would just be, no label necessary. If you believe in the positive you must create the illu sion of the negative or you would not have to use the word 'positive'. It would just be, no label necessary. A belief in God cr eates the polarity of the De vil. There is no God and there is no Devil be cause these are illu sions of mind. But if you believe in, and identify with, either of th em you create the other. Wh en you fight the darkness you create it by believing in it. Many New Ager s have told me over the years that I have to protect myself from dark fo rces and this usually involves some ritual or other, or asking the 'Light' for help. This is such bollocks. Why do I ne ed to protect myself from an illusion? By believing that I have to defend agai nst attacks from the 'Dark', I am creating the Dark in my illusory re ality and giving it power over me. I am telling the RNA to read 'phy sical' reality in that way. What you fight you become, as we can see with the way apparently opposing groups replicate the attitude s, behaviour and me thods of the other. The resonance between them feeds both 'sides' the same blueprint. They are different poles, but the same resonance. This is why apparently 'opposite ' extremes have the same reactions, attitudes and methods. The polariti es are behind the so-called Taw' of cause and effect, which is nothing more than th e 'law' of reaction. It is not a 'law', it is a program. When the Matrix and its Illuminati software instigate something like a war, or anything else contentious, they k now the reaction will create a polarity - in this case anti-war - and the emotions involved are trawled as an energy source. It is Problem-Reaction-Absorp tion. Multi-millions of genuin e people who want to stop war and injustice have been caught by the Matrix through the ill usion of fighting for something. To fight for freedom is to re sonate with its pole, fighting to suppress; and fighting in any form is a low-vibrationa l state. I love the one about fighting for peace. What staggering self-d elusion that is. Doing what you know to do should not be confused with fighting fo r what you believe to be right. It is a totally different state of awareness that does not identify with being on a 'side' and so does not involve polarity. It just is . Reaction is the force behind the desire for revenge and nothing creates polarity more effectively than that. They say don't get mad, get even, but what we really need to do is get conscious. This brings me to something that I know most people will find extremely difficult to comprehend and again there are not the words to fully communicate what I mean. If you thought 'sto p thinking' was weird enough, ge t this. To truly connect in awareness with the One, we need to stop making choices, stop trying to change anything and have no sense of purpose. What? I know, but hear me out. Firstly, this does not mean sitting in a cross-legged positi on staring at the wall forever more. It is not that experiences don't happe n in your life, it is what makes them happen and the state of being from which they happen. On ce more this is something we have to know, not mentally understand, but I'll do my best with the words available. There are a number of lines in the Matrix movies that speak about 'purpose'. One guy says: "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"192 'Every program that is created must have a purpose. If it does not it is deleted'. And the Agent Smith character, a computer program, observed: 'Without purpose we would not exist. It is purpose that created us, purpose that connects us, purpose that pulls us, that guide s us, that drives us. It is purpose that defines us, purpose that binds us.' He might have added: 'It is purpose that controls us'. I am going to state the obvious, but sometimes that is necessary because we mi ss it: to be Infinite Possibility we need to be Infinite Possibility. We cannot be Infinite Possibility by being anything less than that . To identify wi th a single possi bility is not to encompass all into Oneness. When we ha ve a purpose we are not in connection with the One because the On e does not have purpose, it just is. Another of writer Oscar Wilde's famous quotes was: 'Ambition is the last refuge of the failure'. Ambition is a state of purpo se and wanting, not being. My dictionary says that purpose is 'an anticipated outcome that is intended or that guides your planned actions'. Exactly, it is association with outco me, not Infinite Possibility. Purpose is a program of the Matrix because , as Agent Smith said, it de fines us. And it defines us as a part not a whole. When what you are can be defined the Matrix has you because Oneness - Isness - is indefinable. When you have a purpose to do something, that is what you become. You are defined by self and people as a politician, lawyer, ju dge, stockbroker or whatever. To be without purpose does not mean to sit down and do noth ing; it is to cease to identify who you are with what you are doing and no l onger let what you do define you. What you do just is instead of what you are. When I started my journey to expose the conspiracy I had a purpose and it defined me. I was a seeker of truth w ho wanted to alert people to what was happening. I was doing what I did for a pur pose. Not anymore. I have no purpose in what I do and it is a completely different state of being that has to be experienced to be understood. I did not write this boo k with the purpose of alerting people, changing people or changing anything. I ju st wrote it. The words just are, the book just is. Within 'is' lies purpose and no pu rpose - the One. When we make choices through mind or emotion we are pursuing purpose. I did not choose to write this book. There was no point when I made the choi ce to start writing - it just happened, no choice necessary. When we make a choi ce about anything we are using mind or emotion and creating a polarity with other po ssible choices. What we call 'guilt' is the resonance between choices made and c hoices that could have been made. When you don't make choices there are no polarities. To choose is to select and we do this by thinking, which is the program. When we are in a state of knowing there are no choices to make because we are not faced with alternatives. Knowing knows, it does not have to sele ct from options. When we set out to change something we create a pola rity with the status quo and empower the control system. I hear that everything is always in a state of change and that without chan ge - movement - nothing co uld exist. To quote Agent"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"193 Smith again: 'Without purpose we would not exist'. That's what the program wants us to believe. The trinity of purpose-choice- change is the Matrix . It is the realm of doingness, not isness. Th e One does not change in the se nse that it is always One, always Infinite Possibility. Therefore, pur pose, choice and change can only manifest in a state of illusory discon nection that identif ies with form, lim itation and time. Purpose implies to move into the future; but there is no future, it's an illusion. To make choices is to identify with personality, no t infinity. To seek change is to identify with the mo vie, the illusion, not the un changing One. And what we identify with we give power to. Okay, I can hear the question and I unders tand it. If we don't pursue purpose, choice and change, does that mean we just sit around and do nothing while the Illuminati impose terror, c ontrol and mayhem? Well, yes and no. It is not about doing, but being. To do is to make a choice to do. It is a process of thought and that is the program, the Matrix, creating polarities. To be is to know - the One. The pursuit of purpose and doing gets in the way of th at. Oneness is the bala nce of all, and the Illuminati agenda is not ba lance, but polarities. To ch allenge the Illuminati is not balance, but polarity. To be is to encomp ass them both and identify with neither. When we come from the perspective of Oneness and move with the flow of knowingness, things just happen without us needing to choose, think, fight or pursue. We might appear to do, in the sense th at I have done something by writing this book. But it is really a manifestation of beingness because I did not set out with the mindset of doing anything for the purpose of change. I know it is difficult to get this over with langu age, but when you dr op into this mode of knowing and being it makes perfect sense in a wa y that words cannot deliver. The road to freedom and On eness is not to create po larities, but to encompass them. When people ask me how I describe my self, I say: I am and I'm not; I'm everything and nothing; I' m everywhere and nowhere; I am all possibility and none. This sounds ridiculous in a world imprisoned by identi fication with polarity. How can I be all these 'opposites'? Surely I must be one or the ot her? But if I am a polarity, how can I be the On e? In science they talk about matter and antimatter, negative and positive polarities in the realm of particles. When a particle and its antiparticle meet they 'annihilate' each other and thei r entire mass is converted into pure energy. The power produced by this fusion of po les is simply fantastic. The polarities with which we iden tify are similar in principl e to matter and antimatter and we can bring about this 'annihilatio n' into Oneness only by bringing them together. Instead of identifying with one, we can be both and fuse them into balance. You identify with the whole, not the illusory parts. Y ou are and you're not; you are everywhere and nowhere; ever ything and nothing; negative and positive; you can and you can't; you will and you won't; you are for and against; you believe and you don't. By being both you 'annih ilate' both and what's left is Oneness. As we do this we dismantle the power of the Ma trix that depends on polarity. We are in the midst of a collective tran sformation, at least at this level of perception, although I don't believe it's the one the New Age and others talk about.

The year 2012 would appear very significant to the Illuminati and this is also the point at which the Mayan Calendar says there will be a transformation to a new world. The anci ent Mayans, in what is now Central America, developed their ow n measurement of time and observed repeating cycles that they detailed in the cal endar. They said that a Great Cycle began on August 11th, 3114 BC and would end on the winter solsti ce, December 21st, 2012, the point when a 'Great, Great Cycle' of 26,000 year s would also come to a conclusion. It relates to the New Ag e belief about moving from the astrologi cal Age of Pisces to the 'enlightened' Age of Aquarius. This is the moment when new cycles will begin, it is said, and humani ty will be infused with love and light. A Mayan Calendar website summarised this basic theme: 'There is no reason not to take a leap of faith into imagining what may be in store. We may trust that it is time for humanity to awaken into a true partnership with each other, with the earth, and the Cosmos. By accepting this partnership we may claim our birthright and become Galactic Citizens who care for and sustain the planet, thus sustaining ourselves. This is clearly the c hallenge of our times. Yet, arriving just in time and on schedule is the Winter Solstice dawn on the day we may remember that we are truly Children of the World.' At the risk of upsetting many in the New Age, I say this is the fake transformation. I have no problem with the fact that 2012 is signi ficant in Time Loop terms, nor that the Mayans clearly had a remarkable grasp on the planetary and cosmic cycles they related to time. I ju st say they were me asuring the computer program, the cosmic planetarium, and th at the predicted transformation is as illusory as the rest of this holographic real ity. It is another pa rt of the DVD, another diversionary subplot. There is no time, and anything that identifies with it is not a transformation to Oneness. We are not 'tru ly Children of the World', we are truly Infinite Consciousness. Identifying self with the 'world' is identifying with the Matrix. It is a belief system that still rela tes to form, with bei ng 'human', 'Galactic Citizens', and sustaining a ho lographic illus ion we call 'earth'. Millions are caught by the Matrix in the fake transformation. The Mayan Calendar is one example and so is Ashtar Command. I attended an event in London in which members of a remaining tribe of Incas told of coming upheavals and change. They lived high in the Andes Mountains of Peru where their people had re mained isolated from the rest of society until, as their legends foretold 500 years earlier, a se ries of signs appeared that told them the transformation of humanity had arrived. The legends said that when they saw the signs they should come down from the mount ains and tell the world that the next 'Pachacuti' had begun. Pacha means 'earth ' or 'time', and Cuti means 'to turn upside-down'. This is a common theme an d, again, I am sure the upheaval and chaos they predict (including major geologic al events) is designed by the Matrix to happen, as in fact it already is. But I st ill say the 2012 scenario is a change in the program, not truly a transfor mation to Oneness in awareness of it self. The latter is "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" Figures 86 and 87: As the energy of Oneness pervades the Ma trix, the fear vibration dissolves and the reality of its captive consciousness is transformed nothing to do with an Age of Aquarius, which is just another scene on the DVD. There is something else going on that does not relate to programmed astrological mo vements or cycles of time. It is a transformation emitting from a level of awareness in which ill usions like cosmic cycles are irrelevant. To continue the computer analogy, Oneness is hack ing into the system. Synchronicity or coordinated 'coincidence' can have many cau ses. It can be the Matrix program; it can be consciousness caught in the cause a nd effect illusion we call the cycle of reincarnation and karma; and it can be r econnecting in awareness - knowing - with the One, All That Is, and being drawn to similar stat es of consciousness. The synchronicity of knowing free s you from the synchronicity of the program. The trick is knowing which is which. It is reconnecting with Onene ss that carries the energy of true transformation and anyone can do this by ceasing to identify with the illusion and being the One that they are. The Matrix 'trans formation' and the Oneness transformation are running together and the way to tell them apart is their effect. Does a change or event bring love or conflict? Balance or imbalance? Justice or injustice? Does it further divide or bring together? Does it imprison or does it set free?

That's all we need to do to transform from limitation to All Possibility. The balance of Oneness strips away imbalanced thought and emotion and excite s the particles of th e holographic realm to vibrate ever faster until there is no vibration at all. It will balance the body holograms of those that connect with it, restore them to health and end the ageing process that sees so many play out their p hysical lives in pain and infirmity. As we are transformed from fear to love, so we send that en ergy to the Matrix central computer and rewrit e its program. From there it is transmitted back to all holograms within the super-hologram and those programs are also rewritten in the language of love. The balance of Oneness will also heal the gaps in the fabric of our collective reality called interspaces. They are a sy mptom of fragmentation and cannot exist within unity. Wi th that, and the massively increased potential to see beyond the veil of 'visible light', so much that has remained hidden comes into conscious view. As the frequenc y rises, so our relationship to illusory 'time' changes and those flowing with the transfor mation experience 'time' as passing ever faster. Oneness has always been ther e, but now it is being felt again and, for those who are freeing themselves from th e program, home is calling. We have been caught in a dreamworld that we have believed to be real. This includes those other dimensions of th e illusion between which the captive consciousness of the Matrix 'reincarnates' from one program to another. The way home is to know we are already home a nd always have been. It is to stop identifying who we are with form, the need to 'evolve', to learn from endless reincarnated experience, and being subordina te to the will of some 'God'. They are all strands in the web of control, s ubplots in the movie. Instead we can know we are Oneness and see this illusion for what it is, a silly game created by our own fear. If you live your life know ing you are the On e, your entire perspective is transformed (Figure 88). What seemed im portant or fearful becomes the focus for hysterical laughter. When you look at the world from th e perspective of being the One, all those things that annoy you or make you frustr ated, depressed and in fear are seen to be the irrelevance that they are. It is worth asking when these situations arise: how would the One vi ew this? Would the One care less if someone said 'fuck'? Would the One condemn sexual preference? Would the One get angry because a sports team didn' t win? Would the One go to a voting booth or support a political party? Would the One follow a religion or contem plate the pote ntial perils of a Cheese Danish? Woul d the One have to protect itself from an illusory 'Darkness'? Would the One worry about its astrology or karma or what it was in a previous life? Would the One feel the need to succeed or 'be' someone? Would the One go to war or fight fo r peace? Would the One worry about an ything, regret the 'past' or fear the 'future'? Would the One be frightened of 'death' when it doesn't exist? No to all of them because they are illusions.

I was delighted to see that their di scoveries supported the main themes of this book and here is a summary of their work av ailable at a number of websites. The italicised emphasis a nd comments are mine: The human DNA is a biological Internet and superior in many aspects to the artificial one. The latest Ru ssian scientific research dire ctly, or indirectly, explains phenomena such as clairvoyance, intu ition, spontaneous and remote acts of healing, self healing, affirmation tec hniques, unusual light-auras around people (namely 'spiritual masters'), mind's influence on weather-patterns and much more. In addition, there is evidence for a whole new type of medicine in which DNA can be influenced and reprogrammed by words and frequencies without cutting out and replacing single genes [as I sugg ested in chapter five and in previous books]. Only ten per cent of our DNA is being used for building proteins [many say 3% to 5%]. It is this subset of DNA that is of interest to west ern researchers and is being examined and categor ized. The othe r 90% are considered 'junk DNA'. The Russian researchers, however, convinced that nature was not dumb, joined linguists and geneticists in a venture to explore those 90% of 'junk DNA'. Their results, findings and conclu sions are simply revolutiona ry! According to them, our DNA is not only responsible for the constr uction of our body, but also serves as data storage and in communication. DNA is an organic superconductor that can work at normal body temperature, as opposed to artificial superconductors which require extremely low temperatures to function. In addition, all superconductors are able to store light and information. This further explains how DNA can store information. The Russian linguists found that the genetic code, especially in the apparently useless 90%, follows the same rules as all our human lang uages. To this end they compared the rules of synt ax (the way in which word s are put together to form 199 A"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"200 phrases and sentences), semantics (the st udy of meaning in language forms) and the basic rules of grammar. They found that the alkalines of our DNA follow a regular grammar and do have set rules just like our languages. So human languages did not appear coincidentally but are a reflection of our inherent DNA [the program]. The Russian biophysicist and molecular biologist, Pjotr Garjaj ev, and his colleagues, also explored the vibrational behaviour of the DNA. The bottom line was: 'Living chromosomes function just like solitonic-holographic computers using the endogenous DNA laser radiation'. [Solitons ar e a special type of light wave that doesn't change shape as it travels.] This means that th ey managed, for example, to modulate certain frequency patterns onto a laser ray, and used it to influence the DNA frequency and thus the genetic informa tion itself. [This process is what we call 'Evolution'', as I said earlie r]. Since the basic structure of DNA-alkaline pairs, and of language, are of the same structure, no DNA decoding is necessary. One can simply use words and sentences of the human la nguage! This, too, was experimentally proven! [This phenomenon is captured in the water crystal images of Masaru Emoto formed by words and frequencies.] Living DNA substance will always react to langua ge-modulated laser rays, and even to radio waves, if the proper frequencies are being used. This finally and scientifically explains why affirmations, autoge nous training, hypnos is and the like can have such strong effect s on humans and their bodies. It is entirely normal and natural for our DNA to react to language. [I t is a computer program that can be rewritten by this data input]. While west ern researchers cut single genes from the DNA strands and insert them elsewhere, the Russians enthusiastically worked on devices that can influence the cellula r metabolism through suitably modulated radio and light frequencies and thus repair genetic defects. Garjajev's research gro up succeeded in proving with this method that chromosomes damaged by x-rays can be repaired. They ev en captured information patterns of a particular DNA and transm itted it onto another, so reprogramming cells to another genome. They successfully transformed, for example, frog embryos to salamander embryos si mply by transmitting the DNA information patterns! [In others words, they rewrote the program and changed - shapeshifted! - the waveform/hologram.] This way the entire in formation was transmitted without any of the side effects or disharmonies enc ountered when cutting out and reintroducing single genes from the DNA. This represents an unbelievable, world-transforming revolution and sensation! All this by si mply applying vibr ation and language instead of the archaic cutting -out procedure! This experi ment points to the immense power of wave genetics, which obviously has a greater influen ce on the formation of organisms than the biochemical processes of alkaline sequences [in fact, one is an expression of the other]. Esoteric and spiritual teachers have known for ages that our body is programmable by language, words and thought. This has now been scientifically proven and explained. Of course, the freque ncy has to be correct, and this is why not everybody is equall y successful or can do it with always the same strength. The"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"201 individual must work on the inner processe s and maturity in or der to establish a conscious communication with the DNA [consciousness can rewrite the program, as I have emphasised throughout th e book]. The Russian research ers work on a method that is not dependent on these factors but will always work , provided one uses the correct frequency. But the higher developed an individual's consciousness, the less need is there for any type of device! One can achieve these results by oneself, and science will finally stop laughing at such ideas an d will confirm and explain the results. Modern man knows this only on a much more subtle level, as 'intuition' [knowing!]. But we, too, can regain full use of it. An example fr om Nature: When a queen ant is spatially separated from her colony, bui lding still continues ferven tly and according to plan. If the queen is killed, however, all work in the colony stops. No ant knows what to do. Apparently the queen sends the 'build ing plans' from far away via the group consciousness of her subjects. She can be as far away as she wants, as long as she is alive. [The Queen ant is like the Matrix 'brain'.] In man, 'hypercommunication' [communication at levels beyond the five-sense realm] i s most often encountered when one sudden ly gains access to information that is outside one's knowledge base. Such 'hype rcommunication' is then experienced as inspiration or intuition [knowing]. The Italia n composer, Giuseppe Tartini dreamt one night that a devil sat at his bedside playin g the violin. The next morning Tartini was able to note down the piece exactly from me mory; he called it the Devil's Trill Sonata. For years, a 42-year old male nurse dreamt of a situat ion in which he was hooked up to a kind of knowledge CD-ROM. Verifiable knowledge from all imaginable fields was then transmitted to him that he was able to recall in the morning. There was such a flood of information that it seemed a whole encyclopaedia was transmitted at night. The majority of fa cts were outside his personal knowledge base and reached technical de tails about which he knew ab solutely nothing. [This is like a computer download. A computer does not have to know anything about the information it records.] When hypercommunication occurs, one ca n observe special phenomena in the DNA, as well as in the hu man being. The Russian sc ientists irradiated DNA samples with laser li ght. On screen, a ty pical wave pattern was formed. When they removed the DNA sample, the wave pattern did not disappear, it remained. Many control experiments showed that the pattern still came from the removed sample, whose energy field apparently remained by itself. This effect is now called phantom DNA effect. The phenomenon encountered mo st often in hype rcommunication is inexplicable electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the people concerned. Electronic devices like CD pl ayers and the like can be ir ritated and cease to function for hours. When the electroma gnetic field slowly dissipates, the devices function normally again. Many healers and psychics know this effect from their work. The better the atmosphere and th e energy, the more frustrati ng it is that the recording device stops functioning and r ecording exactly at that moment [I have experienced this many times]. Repeated switching on a nd off after the sess ion does not restore function, but next morn ing all is back to nor mal. Perhaps this is reassuring to read "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"202 for many, as it has nothing to do with them being technically in ept; it means they are good at hypercommunication. [Remember the story of my experience in Brazil during the ayahuasca session when the lights came on without electricity and the music player went off and on.] The Russian scientists also found that our DNA can cause dist urbing patterns in a vacuum, thus producing magnetized wormholes! Wormholes are microscopic equivalents of the so-called Ei nstein-Rosen bridges in the vi cinity of black holes (left by burned-out stars). These are tunnel connections between en tirely different area s in the universe, through which informa tion can be transmitted outsid e of space and time. The DNA attracts these bits of inform ation and passes them on to our 'consciousness' [what I call 'mind' and 'emotion' - the DNA networ k). This process of hypercommunication (telepathy, channelling, [knowing]) is most ef fective in a state of relaxation. Stress, worry or a hyperactive inte llect prevent successful hypercommunication or the information will be totally distorted and useless. [This is another reason why the system is designed to keep us in a state of stress, worry and constant mental/emotional activity. It is also why left brain 'intellectuals' that dominate 'education' and 'science' cannot access the level of intuitive knowing that would expose their flawed and rigid beliefs.] There is another phenomenon linked to DNA and wormholes. Normally, these super-small wormholes are highly unstable and are maintained only for the tiniest fractions of a second. Under certain co nditions stable wormholes can organize themselves, which then form distinctive vacuum do mains in which, for example, gravity can transform into electricity. Vacuum domains are self-radiant balls of ionized gas that contain considerable amounts of energy. There are regions in Russia where such radiant balls appear ve ry often and it was this that motivated research programs that led to some of the discoveries detailed here. Many 'spiritual teachers' also produce su ch visible balls or columns of light in deep meditation or during energy work, and in certain Earth healing projects such light effects also appear on photographs. Simply put, this phenomenon has to do with gravity and anti-gravity forces that are ever more stable forms of wormholes, and displays of hypercommunication with energies from outside our time and space structure [the Time Loop]. Earlie r generations that experienced such hypercommunication and visible vacuum do mains were convinced that an angel had appeared before them an d we cannot be sure what forms of consciousness we can get access when using hype rcommunication. We have made another giant step towards understanding our reality. Official science also knows of gravity anomalies on Earth that contribute to the formatio n of vacuum domains . Recently gravity anomalies have been found in Rocca di Papa, south of Rome. In their book Vernetzte Intelligenz (Net worked Intelligence) , Grazyna Fosar and Franz Bludorf explain these connections precisely and cl early. The authors also quote sources who believe that in earlier times humanity was once, just like the animals, very strongly connected to the group consciousness and acted as a group. To develop and experience indi viduality, we humans had to forget"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"203 hypercommunication almost completely [I would say that it was deliberately suppressed]. Now that we are fairly stable in our individual co nsciousness, we can create a new form of group consciousness, na mely one in which we attain access to all information via our DNA, without being forced or remotely controlled about what to do with that informati on. We now know that, just as on the Internet, our DNA can feed its proper data into the network; can call up data from the network; and can establish contact w ith other participants in the network [exactly as this book describes]. Remote healing, telepathy or 'remote sensing' [intuitive knowing] can thus be explained. Some animals know also from afar when their owners plan to return home. That can be freshly interpreted and explained via the concepts of group consciousn ess and hypercommunication [the DNA network]. Any collective consciousness ca nnot be sensibly used over any period of time without a distinctive individuality. Otherwise, we would revert to a primitive herd instinct that is easily manipulated [the Illuminati agenda for the human race today]. Hypercommunication in the new millennium means so mething quite different. Researchers think that if humans with full individuality wo uld regain group consciousness, they would have a god-like power to create, alter and shape things on Earth! And humanity is collectively movi ng toward such a group consciousness of the new kind. Fifty per cent of today's children will be 'problem' children as soon as they go to school. The system lu mps everyone together and demands adjustment. But the individuality of today's children is so strong that that they refuse this adjustment and resist giving up their idiosyncrasies in the most diverse ways [Well, many do but vast numbers do not]. At the same time, more and more clairvoyant children are born. Something in those children is striving towards the group consciousness of th e new kind, and it will no longer be suppressed. As a rule, weather is rather difficult to influence by a single individual. But it may be influenced by a gro up consciousness (n othing new to some tribes doing it in their rain dances). Weather is strongly influenced by Earth re sonance frequencies, the so-called Schumann frequencies [a sort of planetary heartbeat]. But those same frequencies are also produced in our br ains, and when many people synchronise their thinking, or individuals ('spiritual ma sters', for instance), focus their thoughts in a laser-like fashion, then it is, scientific ally speaking, not at al l surprising if they can thus influence weather. [The Illumina ti are manipulating the weather and geological activity using technology and the vibrational principle is the same.] Researchers in group consci ousness have formulated the theory of Type I civilisations. A humanity that developed a grou p consciousness of this new kind would have neither environmental problems, nor scarcity of energy. [How can you have scarcity within In finite abundance? Only if you believ e in it.] For, if humanity were to use its mental power as a unified ci vilisation, it would have co ntrol of the energies of its home planet as a natural consequence [it would rewrite the program]. And that includes all natural catastrophes! A theoretical Type II civilisation would even be able to control al l energies of their home ga laxy.
