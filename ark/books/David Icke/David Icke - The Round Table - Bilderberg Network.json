There are many more elite groups within it's web, but these \"Round Table\" organisations are a key part of its day to day manipulation of politics, banking, business, the military (especially NATO), \"education\", and so on. You can read about all this in great detail in my books, And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Biggest Secret. But briefly, the network was created to advance through the 20th century and beyond the Illuminati agenda for the centralised control of Planet Earth. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Adminis...ETWORK%20~%20Articles%20by%20David%20Icke.htm (2 of 11) [4/7/2002 2:59:46 PM]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE ROUND TABLE-BILDERBERG NETWORK ~ Articles by David Icke The Round Table was created in London (the Illuminati's operational centre) in the latter years of the 19th century. Its first official \"leader\" was Cecil Rhodes, the man who mercilessly manipulated Southern Africa and took those lands from the black peoples. Although, in theory, black people are back in political control of Africa, the real decisions are still made by the European and American elites via their black puppet presidents and leaders. \"Independence\" is an illusion. Rhodes played tribe against tribe until they destroyed each other in war, so allowing Rhodes and the British to take over. The same is happening today in the continuing wars in Africa, details of which you will find on this site. Rhodes said the goal of the Round Table was to create World Government controlled by Britain (the Illuminati based in Britain). When he died in 1902, he left money in his will to fund \"Rhodes Scholarships\" in which overseas students had their expenses paid to study at Oxford University - the centre of the Illuminati's manipulation of \"education\". The ratio of these \"Rhodes Scholars\" who go back to their countries to enter positions of political, economic, and media power is enormous compared with the general student population. They act as Illuminati agents. The most famous Rhodes Scholar in the world today is Bill Clinton, the two-times President of the United States. But while Rhodes was the official front man for the Round Table, the real controllers and funders were, and are, the House of Rothschild, the banking dynasty which is at the heart of so much of the global conspiracy. This is not an anti-Jewish remark because the Rothschilds claim to be Jewish.

See Was a Hitler a Rothschild on this site. The inner elite of this Round Table in the US and UK were the key members of their government's war administrations before and during the First World War.. As is provable with documentation, they worked together to engineer the circumstances that led to that global conflict. Through their technique of create-the-problem-then-offer-the-solution, they wanted to destroy the global status quo with that war and therefore have the opportunity to re-draw the world in their agenda's image when the conflict was over. This is precisely what they did. Power in the world was in far fewer hands after the war than before, and this was advanced even further when they engineered the Second World War also. This has continued to this day and, indeed, is getting quicker all the time. In 1919, came the Versailles Peace Conference near Paris when the elite of the Round Table from Britain and the United States, people like Alfred Milner, Edward Mandel House, and Bernard Baruch, were appointed to represent their countries at the meetings which decided how the world would be changed as a result of the war these same people had created. They decided to impose impossible reparations payments on Germany, so ensuring the collapse of the post-war Weimar Republic amid unbelievable ecomonic collapse and thus create the very circumstances that brought Hitler (a Rothschild, see related article) to power.

They also decided at Versailles that they now all supported the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. As I show in my books, EVERY ONE of them was either a Rothschild bloodline or was controlled by them. The American President, Woodrow Wilson, was \"advised\" at Versailles by Colonel House and Bernard Baruch, both Rothschild clones and leaders of the Round Table in the United States; The British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, was \"advised\" by Alfred Milner, Rothschild employee and Round Table leader, and Sir Phillip Sassoon, a direct decendent of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the dynasty; The French leader, Georges Clemenceau, was \"advised\" by his Minister for the Interior, Georges Mandel, whose real name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Who do you think was making the decisions here?? As a result of their secret meetings at the Hotel Majestic, The Royal Institute of International Affairs was founded in London in 1920, the Council on Foreign Relations followed in 1921, and then came the Bilderberg Group (1954), the Club of Rome (1968) and the Trilateral Commission (1973). These are dominated by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, and major manipulators like Henry Kissinger, who, in turn, answer to higher powers in the Illuminati.

BARUCH, Bernard (1870-1965). Although he never ran for public office, Bernard Baruch was an adviser to American presidents on economic matters for more than 40 years. As a young man he had shown a remarkable ability to make money by investment. Bernard Mannes Baruch was born on Aug. 19, 1870, at Camden, S.C. His family moved to New York City in 1881, and he attended City College there, graduating at the age of 19. In 1890 Baruch took a job as an office boy in a small New York City brokerage house. By 1897 he owned a one-eighth interest in the firm. He married Annie Griffin; they had three children. Baruch bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and within a few years became a millionaire. By 1903 he had his own firm. His refusal to join any other financial house gave him the reputation as the \"lone wolf of Wall Street.\" Baruch supported Woodrow Wilson in the presidential campaign of 1912. In 1916 Wilson appointed him to the advisory commission of the Council of National Defense. In 1918 he became chairman of the War Industries Board. Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902). South Africa has long attracted men seeking wealth and power. In the 1880s and 1890s Cecil Rhodes found both. He made a fortune in diamonds and gold. As prime minister of Britain's colony at the Cape of Good Hope he was virtual dictator of all South Africa. Rhodes's ambition was not for himself but for his native Britain. He brought Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) into the British Empire (see Zambia ; Zimbabwe ). Cecil John Rhodes was born on July 5, 1853, in Bishop's Stortford, England. When he was 17, tuberculosis kept him from entering Oxford University. He went to South Africa and took part in the rush to the newly discovered Kimberley diamond fields. Within a few months he had made a fortune. The active life restored his health, and he continued his education. For eight years he alternated between study at Oxford and work in South Africa. In 1881, just before taking his degree, he was elected to the parliament of Cape Colony. In 1890 he became its prime minister. Rhodes also controlled the huge companies that owned most of the gold and diamond fields. In 1893 he defeated the Matabele tribe and their king, Lobengula. Meanwhile he schemed against his political opponent Paul Kruger, leader of the Dutch settlers--the Boers--and president of the Transvaal Republic. In 1895 Leander Jameson, Rhodes's friend, raided the Transvaal, hoping to overthrow the Boer government. The raid failed. Rhodes was implicated and forced to resign as prime minister and as director of the British South Africa Company. Rhodes moved to Matabeleland, planning to develop its natural resources. Soon he had the chance to show his statesmanship. The tribal people who lived in the area had revolted and could not be suppressed. Rhodes talked with the chiefs, heard their grievances, and promised relief. The rebellion ended. In 1898 Rhodes was again elected to the Cape Colony parliament. He had begun to regain his old power when the Boer War (1899-1902) began. He took part in the defense of Kimberley, but his health broke and he died file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Adminis...ETWORK%20~%20Articles%20by%20David%20Icke.htm (9 of 11) [4/7/2002 2:59:46 PM]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE ROUND TABLE-BILDERBERG NETWORK ~ Articles by David Icke on March 26, 1902, in Muizenberg. Rhodes's dream of a South African Union came true in 1910. He left his Cape Town residence, Groote Schuur, to be the home of future prime ministers of the Union, now a republic. The University of Cape Town is also situated on his Groote Schuur estate. The Rhodes Scholarships Rhodes left most of his fortune to establish scholarships to Oxford University. Approximately 70 scholarships are awarded each year. They last for two years. The original grant for a scholarship-- 300 pounds--has been raised to more than 2,600 pounds a year. Rhodes scholars are selected from the Commonwealth, Germany, and the United States. Until 1976 only men were eligible. In the United States 32 scholarships are offered each year. Four go to each of eight districts. Candidates must be 18 to 24 years old and must have a degree from a recognized college or university. Each school appoints up to five candidates. From these the state committees of selection nominate two candidates each. Awards are based on leadership, scholastic attainment, success in outdoor sports, and interviews. Scholarship winners may select any course of study at Oxford that they are qualified to pursue. In some cases the scholarship may be extended to cover a third year in postgraduate study. ROTHSCHILD FAMILY For most of the 19th century, the House of Rothschild, a Jewish family of bankers, ruled the money markets of Europe. Many European nations borrowed money from them to pay debts, to wage wars, or to finance peacetime projects. The family name was derived from the red shield (rothen Schilde in German) used by an ancestor as a sign for his shop. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) laid the foundation of the family fortune. He was born in the Jewish quarter of Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. He became a tradesman and provided some banking services, such as exchanging currencies. An expert in rare coins, Mayer Amschel gained admittance to many wealthy homes, notably that of the elector William of Hesse-Kassel. Soon he was entrusted with some of the elector's major financial affairs. Mayer Amschel raised his five sons to work in the family business. The Rothschilds owed their rise as international bankers largely to the Napoleonic Wars. Mayer Amschel's third son, Nathan Mayer (1777-1836), went to England in about 1800 and ran goods for the British through Napoleon's blockade. With his brothers' help, Nathan Mayer also transported gold through France to finance the British army in Spain. This action earned Nathan a post as agent of the British treasury. At the war's end the House of Rothschild was commissioned to handle loans to France and Austria. Nathan' s brother Jacob, or James (1792-1868), established a bank in Paris, France, and his brother Salomon Mayer (1774-1855) set up a bank in Vienna, Austria. A bank in Naples, Italy, founded later by another brother, Karl Mayer (1788-1855), failed to thrive and was closed in about 1861. The oldest brother, Amschel Mayer (1773-1855), remained in charge of the financial business in Frankfurt. The House of Rothschild financed railroads in Europe and America and provided loans to the United States. Nathan Mayer' s son Lionel Nathan (1808-79) in 1875 loaned Britain the money used by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to buy control of the Suez Canal. Lionel Nathan was the first Jew to be elected to the British Parliament, and his son Nathan Mayer (1840-1915) became the first Baron Rothschild. The Rothschilds have received many honors. Members of the British and French families--the only ones still engaged in banking after the Nazis seized the Austrian house--have distinguished themselves as file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Admini...TWORK%20~%20Articles%20by%20David%20Icke.htm (10 of 11) [4/7/2002 2:59:46 PM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE ROUND TABLE-BILDERBERG NETWORK ~ Articles by David Icke scientists and philanthropists. LLOYD GEORGE, David (1863 -1945). At the age of 17, a small slender Welshman visited the British House of Commons. Afterward he recorded in his diary his hope for a political career. The Welshman, David Lloyd George, in time became the prime minister who guided Great Britain to victory over Germany in World War I. David George was born on Jan. 17, 1863, in Manchester, England, where his Welsh father, William George, had gone to teach school. His father died in June 1864. Soon after, the family returned to Wales. David was educated by his uncle, Richard Lloyd, the village cobbler. In his honor the boy took the name Lloyd. At the age of 14 he began to study law and at 21 was admitted to practice as a solicitor. In 1890 he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal from the Welsh borough of Caernarvon. \"The great little Welshman\" held his seat in the Commons for 55 years. CLEMENCEAU, Georges (1841-1929). In 1917, near the end of World War I, Georges Clemenceau accepted the post of premier of France. His country seemed on the verge of losing the war; but the premier, a man of 77, guided his people to victory. After the war he presided at the peace conference. Clemenceau founded a daily paper, L'Aurore, to aid the cause of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, convicted of selling French military secrets to Germany. Émile Zola's famous article in defense of Dreyfus, `J'Accuse' (I Accuse), was published in this paper in 1898. In 1913 Clemenceau founded L'Homme libre, meaning The Free Man, in which he warned of the danger of war with Germany. The paper was briefly suppressed in 1914 but reappeared as L'Homme enchaîné, (The Man in Chains). In 1919, while presiding at the peace conference, Clemenceau was wounded by an anarchist. In 1922 he toured the United States to urge cooperation with Europe. He continued to write until his death in Paris on Nov. 24, 1929. file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Admini...TWORK%20~%20Articles%20by%20David%20Icke.htm (11 of 11) [4/7/2002 2:59:46 PM]"}]
