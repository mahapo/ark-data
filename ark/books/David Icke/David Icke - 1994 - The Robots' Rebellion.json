I would say not. I think that how the Universe wasformed is extremely interesting, but not something that it is essential to knowin order to find the path that will lead us out of this mess.What we really need to know – the Big Question – is who we really are and whatwe are doing here in this period of fantastic change and transformation onPlanet Earth. From that understanding, all the other answers will come –including how the Universe was formed. Without that appreciation of the truenature of life, we will go on being mesmerised by this physical world andlargely controlled by its illusions and by those misguided forces, detailed inthis book, which seek to turn us into little more than zombies. In other words,we will destroy ourselves.The irony is that the information already exists to tell us all we need to know,but the implications of this knowledge are so catastrophic for religion,establishment science, education (indoctrination) and the whole economic,political, industrial, and military system, that these answers have beensuppressed. When suppression has not been possible, those who articulate theeternal understanding have been ridiculed, condemned and undermined in every wayimaginable. We still refer to the Great Mysteries of Life, but they only remain‘mysteries’ because of the consequences for the system of their solution. We aretalking here of the most monumental con-trick in the history of the human race,a sleight of hand and mind that involves not only people, but other areas of theUniverse too. It has been a piece of black magic so successful that it hasprogrammed the minds of billions of people to forget who they are, where theycame from, and what they are doing here today.I believe it is time for some straight talking. We are a race of robots. Bythat, I mean that most people do not have a thought in their heads that has notbeen put there by someone or something else. We have become a race of programmedminds which can be persuaded to believe and do almost anything as long as thedrip, drip, drip of lies and misinformation continues to bombard us through ourpolitical systems, the media, religion, schools, universities, and byinfiltration of our consciousness by other universal sources which want to turnPlanet Earth into a zombies’ prison. But, slowly at first and now ever morequickly, the robots are awakening. Instead of meekly accepting a daily diet ofmind control, more and more people are seeing the world in a new light andasking questions they have never asked before. The veil is lifting and therobots’ rebellion has arrived.In this book, I will tell the story of how we forgot our true identity and howthe forces of control are preparing to enter the final phase of their plan totake over the planet and the human race. Humanity has been gripped by aspiritual amnesia which has taken us down a dark and dangerous path from whichwe are now in the process of escaping, or not, depending on the choices we make.Most of what you are about to read will not be new to you. You already know it.You have merely forgotten. You have a memory that retains some of what you haveexperienced in this physical lifetime, but humanity has lost contact with itshigher memory; that part of us which knows the Big Answers to the Big Questions.This book will help you to restore the links with that memory and, once thatbegins to happen, as it has already begun for countless millions around theworld today, you are never going to be the same again.Those who are moving along this road to rediscovery are the ones who are leadingthe robots’ rebellion. It is vital for the future of the human race for as manyas possible to wake up and set out on that same journey. Only by triggering andexpanding a reconnection with our higher levels of being will we have access tothe information and love that we so desperately need in order to heal ourselvesand, through that, to help to heal this beautiful planet we call Earth. We standon the threshold of indescribable and incomprehensible change. We cannot knowexactly what will unfold, because humans are affecting the detail with everypassing minute, but we can be sure that nothing and no-one will be leftuntouched by what is happening on the planet. I believe these changes are theharbingers of a far, far, better world than the one we survey today. I think itwas Voltaire who said: “Those who believe absurdities commit atrocities”.Humanity over many centuries is the living proof of that.We are in the time of awakening when believing absurdities will be part of humanhistory and no longer the very foundations of human life.David Icke, Ryde,Isle of Wight, June 1994"},{"pageContent":"A Definition of WisdomHow can you buy or sell the sky?

That may sound fantastic to you at this stage, but read on and you willsee that it is very real and affecting our lives every day. It is, however, aconspiracy that we can, and will, dismantle.At the heart of this attack on human freedom is the desire to keep from us theknowledge of the spiritual realities of our true selves and the understanding ofour place in this wondrous web of life we call Creation. If you have heard theexplanations about the eternal nature of consciousness and how we are all on anendless journey of evolution through experience, it is fine to move straight onto the first chapter. If such information is new to you it is worth reading thefollowing short summary of the knowledge. The manipulators know this informationis correct, but they don’t want you to know that:The real us is not the physical body we see. That is the vehicle we inhabit fora single physical lifetime on this planet. The eternal us is our consciousness,our spirit, our mind. At that moment we mistakenly call ‘death’ our eternal mind– the thinking, feeling, us – leaves the body and moves on to continue itsevolution elsewhere.This is what happens in a so-called ‘near death experience’. Thousands havedescribed the sensation of leaving their bodies during heart attacks or roadaccidents. They tell the same basic story of looking down on their physicalbodies while doctors try to revive them. “It was my mind, my personality,looking down”, they say, “but I was no longer part of my body.” Then suddenlythey find themselves looking out through their eyes again and they have returnedto the body. This is all that happens to people when they ‘die’. Theirconsciousness leaves the body. Our physical form has a finite life, of course,but our minds live forever. You could think of it as similar to the principle ofthe spaceman on the Moon. He dons an outer shell to experience another planet.During a physical life our minds inhabit the physical shell we call a body.Consciousness and energy are one and the same. All that exists throughoutCreation is the same energy-consciousness in different states of being. Thedifference between everything is their level of consciousness (evolution,understanding, awareness), and the speed the energy is vibrating – its‘frequency’. The faster the vibration, the higher the evolution. One example ofhow a single substance can be many things is water, clouds and ice. These look,feel, and react very differently, but they are all the same substance indifferent states of being. So it is with the energy-consciousness that iseverything.The force we call ‘God’ is not some guy with a beard sitting on a throne. It isthe One Consciousness that is Creation; a wall, the sky, the rain, you, me,everything is ‘God’. We are all droplets in the same ocean of consciousness. Youare me, and I am you. You are everything, and so am I. We are each other, allaspects of the same whole, part of the same seamless stream of energy. Theapparent divisions between us are an illusion.One of the so-called ‘great mysteries’ is where we go after our physical liveshave ended. The Church says to heaven or hell, whatever that is supposed tomean, and materialistic science says we go nowhere because this world is allthere is. In fact the ocean of consciousness we call Creation or God hasinfinite levels of evolution or wavelengths. In the space your body is occupyingnow are all the frequencies of all the radio and television stationsbroadcasting to your area. You can’t see them and they can’t see each other,even though they are sharing the same space, because they are on differentwavelengths. Tune a radio to one of those wavelengths and that is the stationyou will hear. The frequency becomes the radio’s reality, its ‘world’. Move thedial to another station and the radio’s reality changes. It is the same with us.At this time we are tuned to the dense physical wavelength we call the Universe,but when we ‘die’ our consciousness leaves the body and moves on to anotherwavelength.What we call ‘ghosts’ are entities – minds, spirits, – on other wavelengths.They often look misty and transparent because we are not seeing them from theirfrequency, but ours. It is the same when a radio dial is not quite on thestation and you get a fuzzy, less-than-sharp reception. The dominating stationwill be the one nearest the dial but you will hear other stations, too. Invisual terms, that is what is happening when we see a ghost. If you were on thesame frequency as the ghost, it would look as real as you do. Theextra-terrestrials I will be talking about operate mostly on other frequencies,which is why some people see them and some don’t. It depends whether you arecapable of making that psychic leap to tune to other levels.It is by tuning your consciousness to another wavelength that information can bebrought through to this world. This is the process we call channelling,mediumship, or tuning in psychically. Real, open-minded scientists are showingin their research into physics and mathematics that Creation is, indeed, made upof frequencies, and that consciousness is eternal in everyone. However, theyhave to contend with the suppression of this knowledge by the scientificestablishment and the manipulators who control it. These want you to believethat the physical world is all there is and that we are all cosmic ‘accidents’of evolution who don’t exist before birth or after death. What nonsense!Consciousness is constantly reproducing itself as Creation expands into the voidand into infinity. At the highest level, the highest frequency, is the originalconsciousness from which everything has come. It is the sum total of all thathas been learned and experienced since Creation became conscious. This is thelevel you could call the Godhead. I prefer to call it the Source. It, too, isconstantly evolving by observing and absorbing the experiences of all aspects ofitself on the lower frequencies. The Source is the Super Mind from whicheverything has come.I have used the term ‘mind’ to describe the eternal part of us, because I preferto avoid the religious connotations of ‘soul’. But mind, soul, and spirit areinterchangeable terms to describe the amalgamation of energy fields that animatethe physical body and which never die. These exist on what science calls thesub-atomic level which is why we can’t see them. The energies normally vibratetoo quickly for our physical senses, although some sensitive people can detectthem. When we talk of people ‘seeing auras’ they are observing thisconsciousness around the body. It can be a glorious tapestry of colours, our‘coat of many colours’ which changes with our moods because colours, likeeverything else, are energy vibrations. As our state of mind alters, so do thesubtleties of our vibrational state.These energy fields, aspects of our mind, reincarnate into countless physicalbodies on this planet and elsewhere. We are all extra-terrestrials, in that weare here on this planet as part, and only part, of our evolution. Each of uswill have had past lives throughout what we call history. We have been here manytimes in so many different situations and races. This makes the prejudice ofracism and nationalism so utterly ludicrous. Through the law of karma or causeand effect we are creating our own futures with every thought and act, becauseit is true that what we make others experience we will ourselves eventuallyexperience to balance out our evolution.Connecting all our energy fields is a series of vortices called chakras. Thereare seven main ones and countless smaller versions. The main chakras are at thebase of the spine (base chakra), the navel (sacral chakra), the solar plexus(solar plexus chakra), the heart (heart chakra), the throat (throat chakra), theforehead (brow or third eye chakra) and on top of the head (crown chakra). As welearn and evolve, the chakra vortices spin quicker and raise the vibration ofour eternal being, so elevating us to higher frequencies. The energy we calllove comes from the heart chakra and this is how the heart first becameassociated with love. Today it is portrayed as a physical heart, but, as theancients knew, the energy of love emanates from the spiritual heart.The chakras are linked to the physical body through the endocrine system, andimbalances in the energy fields can affect the balance of the body. It is inthis way that stress and other emotional trauma cause physical illness. Theseenergy fields are electromagnetic and are affected by other forms ofelectromagnetism. It is known that people who work with electromagneticequipment or live under power lines are more prone to certain illnesses andcancers. Doctors and scientists say they don’t know why this happens, but infact the electromagnetism from the power lines and technology disrupts theperson’s electromagnetic energy fields, and this filters down to the physicalbody to manifest as a health problem.The mind is a creator because everything is thought. The more powerful theconsciousness, the greater its potential to create. On the non-physicalfrequencies thought creates directly by rearranging the energies into whateverthe thought visualises. Even on the dense physical level, all creation must bepreceded by a thought. A finalised business deal and a finished piece of potteryare thoughts made physical. Thought is all.Every time we think we create an energy field, a thought form, and this is howtelepathy works. One person produces the thought field and another decodes thatfield, mostly without even knowing it. The power of thought to create love andharmony or hate and disharmony is endless and we are all capable of producingboth. The manipulators I speak of in this book know about this power to controlpeople by the use of thought or ‘psychic attack’ as it is called. They directthought energy at targeted individuals and try to control their thinking. Thosewho seek love and harmony in the world need to respond to this misguidedbehaviour with the energy of love and harmony which we can all create wheneverwe wish. We just have to think it and live it. We create our own reality. If wethink failure, that is the energy we will attract to us. We attract what we mostfear, for example, on the principle of like attracts like and this is the basison which the Law of Karma operates also.The manipulators do not want us to know that we are eternal beings of light andlove with limitless potential; nor that we can change the world by changing theway we think; and certainly not that we are all One, all equal parts of the samewhole, on a journey of evolution through experience. People who know and liveall these things are not nearly so easy to control and direct. It would be muchbetter to persuade us that we are cosmic accidents with no future, or imprisonus in the dogma of some rigid religion, and do everything possible to ridiculeand repress information to the contrary.Their aim is to de-link us from the higher levels of ourselves. During anincarnation, not all of our mind, consciousness, incarnates and becomes subjectto the severe pressures and limitations of a dense physical body, only part ofit. I call this the conscious level. The rest of the mind, what has become knownas the subconscious and higher conscious levels, act as a guide through aphysical life. The conscious level (lower self) experiences and the subconsciousand higher conscious levels (higher self) guides through a process of thoughttransfer.The higher self can be likened to Mission Control. It knows the reason for theincarnation – what we have chosen to experience and who with – and what we havechosen to do in service to humanity, the planet, and Creation in general. Wefeel the urgings and communciations of the higher self in our intuition. We feeldrawn to certain places, people, and ways of life. It shows when we say “fancymeeting you here”, “what a small world”, and “what a coincidence”.If we lose touch with Mission Control, our higher consciousness, we can getourselves into terrible trouble and be prone to some stupid and destructivebehaviour. Think what would happen if we were on the Moon in a spacesuit andsomeone cut the link with Mission Control. We would have only two sources ofinformation – what is coming in through the eyes and the ears. This would, bydefinition, be extremely imbalanced, because it would only contain informationfrom the world immediately around us. We would lose contact with those who cansee the wider picture.So if we can be encouraged to switch off the connection with our personalMission Control, the higher self, and the manipulators can at the same timecontrol the flow of information coming in through the eyes and the ears, we canquite easily forget who we really are and what we are doing here. This hashappened to billions of people, who have thus become a form of robot.I have explained these principles in greater depth in other books, and it wouldbe helpful for those new to the subject to read Heal The World or TruthVibrations in conjunction with this one. But within the brief summary here iscontained the knowledge as you will appreciate later that can not only free thehuman race from its current mental imprisonment, but also provide incredibletechnology to produce limitless, non-polluting energy.Why and how this knowledge has been kept from the mass of the people and whathas led humanity along such a dark and destructive path is the story we will nowtell."},{"pageContent":"PART ONETHE DARKNESS"},{"pageContent":"1The Takeover BidWHEN anyone talks about the origin of God they soon find themselves facingfamiliar, unanswerable questions: ‘Who created God?’ and ‘Who created the onewho created God?’ and…You will forgive me, therefore, if I deal with only one generation of God’sfamily history! My belief is that what we call Creation was once a void that wasmere potential. At some point, at least a part of this void became conscious andaware of itself. I know some open-minded scientists who have offeredexplanations based on mathematics and physics of how this could have happened,but all I am sure about is that it did happen.I will call this original consciousness The Source. Over an incomprehensibleperiod of what we call time the Source consciousness began to experiment withits potential to create. Through the power of thought, it created other aspectsof itself and areas within its vast mind for experience and learning. Amongthese was our Universe and all that it contains – including us. Each area isrelatively self-contained within the Ocean of Consciousness and has been allowedto evolve naturally through experience, although all remains connected to theSource. Universes, like all of Creation, are made up of multi-dimensions witheach having its own version of space and time. What we call time on this planetis very different from that of other frequencies. If you saw our space-timeUniverse from above, it would look a little like a doughnut or, more to thepoint, a coil going round and round, orbiting the centre. Everything is in orbitaround a central point. The Earth is orbiting the Sun, as we all know, but thesolar system is also in orbit, as are the galaxy and the Universe. Each ‘coil’is encircled within a vortex, a spiral of energy. The quicker this spiral vortexspins, the quicker the Universe moves through its orbit and, consequently, thequicker ‘time’ appears to pass. The vortex around our Universe is beginning tospin more quickly which is why when so many people say, ‘time just flies thesedays, there’s no time to do everything any more’, they are absolutely right.Hold on tight. We have seen nothing yet.Streams of information emanate from The Source to guide Creation while, from theother direction, flow all the experiences and learning achieved by itsconstituent parts. There is a two-way flow of information between the Source andall areas of its mind. So, while the Source is the ultimate in knowledge, wisdomand love at any given point, it, too, is constantly evolving as it absorbs theexperiences of all its ‘droplets’. The flow of information from the Source comesto this planet via various ‘sub-stations’ such as the Universe and Galaxy. Itcomes in through the Sun to the planets of this solar system. Each level addsits contribution to the information flow to guide the levels below. The Sun isfar more than a massive ball of fire, generating warmth. It is anothersubstation for Source energies. The ancients knew this, or at least their mosthighly-evolved members did, and this is one explanation for the origin of theSun god and Sun worship. The more enlightened members of their number were notworshipping a ball of fire in the sky, they were acknowledging the Solar Logos(Central Sun) through which the knowledge and wisdom of the Source reaches theplanet.Just as the Sun is the mind that guides the solar system, the Galactic Mindguides the galaxy and the Universal Mind guides the Universe. The Source is themind that guides all Creation. Sun spot activity is linked to this flow ofenergy from the Sun to the solar system and this indicates the times when theflow is at its most powerful. We all have the opportunity to tune into thisguidance from the highest level, the Source, but we don’t have to. We can ignoreit if we wish.It may seem hard to believe sometimes when we look at what is happening in theworld, but Creation is another word for love. It is the energy we call love thatholds everything together. Creation is not designed to bring pain and suffering.That is not its purpose. I know that people from all beliefs and backgroundshave tried to explain this contradiction between a Creation based on love andsome of the appalling events that happen minute by minute on Planet Earth. Somespeak of the need for learning through extreme experience while others talk ofsome massive universal ‘experiment’ that has been going on. Neither has feltright to me. If Creation is founded and held together by love, then love must beat the heart of what has happened to the Earth and the human race. Just as thisbook was being completed, I heard an explanation which made more sense to me. Iwas sitting in the quiet of the abbey ruins on a wonderful summer day atGlastonbury in Somerset, England, not far from the famous Glastonbury Tor. Withme was a very close friend of my family and myself, a highly sensitive psychiccalled Yeva. She began to channel information projected by a blue energy fieldshe saw psychically around us. From what came through that day and from theother information I have received directly or through other channels, I feelthat the following is close to the truth, at least in theme, symbolically, notliterally.A very long time ago, an aspect of consciousness became highly imbalanced anddecided to challenge the laws of Creation. These were not laws written down in abook and administered by a judge. They were, you might say, like the laws ofphysics. Everything needs a negative-positive and male-female balance if harmonyis to reign in its consciousness. The balance does not have to be perfect,because both negative and positive experiences are necessary for evolution. Butthe further you stray from balance, the more extreme life becomes. If you go toofar to the positive polarity you lose touch with the practical side of life; youfloat off in a spiritual mist. It’s a bit like the feeling I am told you havewhen you smoke pot or, as I can report from experience, the feeling you haveafter drinking a few beers. You are not quite here. Everyone can be very nice toeveryone else, but nothing gets done. If you have a serious negative imbalance,this will manifest itself in extreme negative behaviour – anger, aggression,conflict, a wish to control and dominate, pain, fear and suffering in all itsforms.I will call the droplet seeking to disharmonise Creation, Lucifer. I will usethe term Lucifer when I am speaking of the original droplet of disharmony andLuciferic consciousness when I am describing the amalgamation of that aspect andall the other consciousness he has since imbalanced, to the extent that it nowdances to his tune. In fact, Lucifer is a misnomer really, in that, if you goback to the origin of the name Lucifer, it breaks down as ‘bringer of light’.This comes from the universal truth that positive energy needs a negativebalancer. When both are in harmony, you get the energy of balance and love whichis called The Light. The positive needs the negative as much as the negativeneeds the positive. This idea of the balancing of two forces, positive-negative,male-female, good-evil, yin-yang and so on, I totally agree with. But, for thepurposes of this book, I will use the name Lucifer to describe something quitedifferent from that. The imbalanced consciousness I will call Lucifer is not anessential part of the positive-negative balance. He is a disrupting,disharmonious aspect of consciousness which is not necessary for humanevolution. More than that, Lucifer’s efforts to close off the channels that linkhumanity to its higher understanding have blocked, not advanced, our evolution.No experience is wasted and all goes into the bank of learning, but I feelstrongly that we did not need to plumb the depths in order to reach the state ofunderstanding that will raise us to a higher frequency. A balance of negativeand positive experience is one thing, but I do not believe the negative extremeswe have seen on Earth have had to be part of that.Lucifer wished to experiment with the laws of balance and harmony. I refer tothis mind as ‘he’ because he is dominated, not only by negative energy, but bymale energy also. At one time he was a consciousness of balance, love andadvanced evolution – but that was to change. It may well be that somethinghappened which was beyond his control but which initially imbalanced this aspectof consciousness. It could be that an experiment he conducted into what wouldhappen if you opposed the laws of harmony went terribly wrong – rather likecreating a spiritual Frankenstein which ends up controlling the scientist.Whatever the background, Lucifer began to challenge the harmony of Creation. Ihave long been aware of this but Yeva’s channelling added a piece to the puzzle.It answered the question of why humanity has been a target of this Lucifericconsciousness.Creation is not some random, uncoordinated, every-droplet-for-itself chaos. Whenthis Luciferic consciousness began to make its disharmony felt, the higherlevels of Creation began to intervene because it was imposing itsmisunderstandings on others and breaking the universal law of free will.Something had to be done, as they say. This is where humanity comes in. Again,contrary to popular belief, the human consciousness stream has an enormouscapacity for love and compassion. We are not what we seem to be, but thennothing is ever what it seems. A decision was made at the collective level ofhuman consciousness to give this disruptive mind called Lucifer an opportunityto find its balance again and to re-synchronise with the rest of Creation.Every species has a collective mind to which all of the individual ‘droplets’are connected. We are multi-dimensional beings, with each level having its ownawareness and ability to think and make decisions. So it was that the collectivemind of humanity agreed to set aside its own evolution for a certain period togive the Luciferic consciousness a chance to re-balance itself. This highlynegative consciousness was unleashed on this part of the Universe. It was notonly humanity which agreed to this, the collective minds of other universalcivilisations (extra-terrestrials) did the same, and not only the physical levelwas affected. Everything is multidimensional, including the Universe. In thesame space occupied by this physical world are all the other levels. TheLuciferic consciousness began to operate on those levels, too.The effects did not happen overnight. But disharmony creates more disharmonyand, once the Luciferic consciousness had begun to disrupt the balance and flowof the energies, it started a roll which would gather pace on an ever-steepeningcurve. Disharmony created even more disharmony. Lucifer is clearly not a beingwith horns and a tail. He is a large aspect of Divine consciousness which choseto work against the Source. Like all consciousness, he generates thoughtpatterns. It is the same principle as that employed by a radio station when ittransmits its wavelength to the world. Once transmitted, the wavelength can bepicked up by any radio tuned to that station. Everyone is transmitting thoughtpatterns every second. So, when you have a powerful and evergrowing aspect ofconsciousness pouring out negative patterns of great disharmony, it is easy tosee how vast areas of other consciousness can be affected. Once they are tunedto your wavelength you can, like a radio station, feed them any information youwish them to hear. In consciousness terms, these transmitted patterns can appearto be thoughts of our own when they really originate in the minds of others. Insuch instances, we are merely tuning to them without realising it.The Luciferic consciousness and its broadcasts were designed to createimbalance. Lucifer feeds off negative energy and the more of that that he cangenerate, the stronger and more powerful he becomes. His impact began to growand affect a wider area. Other droplets were imbalanced by the disharmony andturmoil and joined the ‘team’ or what I call collectively the Lucifericconsciousness. The thinking and perceptions of increasing numbers of entities inthis solar system and galaxy were affected. The Luciferic consciousness, farfrom taking the opportunity to re-balance itself, was trying to take over andturn harmony into the image of its own imbalance. The moment arrived when theongoing process of disharmony was such that a call went out across the Universefor volunteers to dedicate themselves, for however long was necessary, toreverse it. The ocean of consciousness was ceasing to be a gentle, balancedflow. In some areas it was more like a tidal wave of emotional and mentalturmoil and torment. Throughout the book I will refer to the ‘volunteers’ or‘volunteer consciousness’. By this I mean those who have dedicated themselves torestore harmony and help the Earth to re-synchronise with the rest of theGalactic and Universal family. These volunteers came forward on many levels andthe struggle began between light and dark, a theme seen throughout ancient textsand legends. This has been portrayed symbolically in films like Star Wars andThe Empire Strikes Back. The writers of much science fiction are really tappinginto a memory of what actually happened, not always in detail, but in theme.This struggle between harmony and disharmony has been happening on all levels,physical and non-physical.Other volunteers, aspects of very highly-evolved consciousness, came into theUniverse and this galaxy in an effort to restore harmony. They did not incarnatein physical bodies on the Earth. They arrived in massive spacecraft, some ofthem miles in length, while others simply manifested themselves here. These wereextra-terrestrials who came to bring knowledge to this planet hundreds ofthousands of years ago. There were two distinct life streams on the planet then,the highly evolved extra-terrestrials and the much more primitive Earth people.The idea was that, over thousands of years, the Earth people would be helped toevolve more quickly.Waves of these beings began many civilisations on the Earth, including the oneswe know as Pan, Mu (Lemuria) and Atlantis. These civilisations were much moreadvanced in their technology and understanding of Creation than we are today.Plato talked of Atlantis more than two thousand years ago and it has been atheme that has recently grown more powerful in the human mind. It was acontinent in what is now the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantis was powered by the use ofnon-physical energy, the harnessing of the sea of energy around us. Crystalswere part of this power and light source and all the power and warmth theyneeded was produced without any pollution or damage to the Earth. That knowledgeis going to be available to us as the present transformation continues. Indeed,much of it is already available but has been suppressed to protect empires ofself interest. There was no religion as such at that time but there were placeswhere people went to learn the laws of Creation and how to use energies tocreate harmony and to speed the positive progress of human understanding. Theycould communicate with animals telepathically and through sound, particularlywith that most evolved of non-human life, the dolphin. The Atlanteans couldperform what we would see today as miracles. They were not miracles at all.There is no such thing as a miracle or the paranormal. They are simply thenatural laws of Creation at work. Atlanteans could levitate objects andthemselves at will; they could cause spontaneous combustion; they could manifestand de-manifest matter. They raised its vibratory rate until it ceased to bephysical. Then, when they restored its original vibration, it reappeared as aphysical form.Their bodies were different from ours and very different from those of the Earthpeople on the planet at that time. They were less dense and they could floatabove the ground through the power of their consciousness. Many couldmaterialise and de-materialise themselves along the lines of ‘Beam me up,Scotty’ in Star Trek but without the need for its technology. They were muchtaller than we are. Sensitive people who have had visions of this Atlantean timespeak of seeing figures of seven feet and more, with gold complexions andslanting, pale blue eyes. The Atlanteans also lived for many hundreds of yearsin each incarnation because their bodies were more in tune with the energiesaround them. As they understood the true nature of life, they could treatdisease (disharmony) before it became a physical problem. Today we wait for thephysical symptoms but, by then, it is often too late. The volunteerconsciousness which are known as Lemurians and Atlanteans came to raise theunderstanding on this planet in order to help the Luciferic consciousness tobreak out of its spiral of disharmony and to protect the human consciousnessfrom being affected by that disharmony.All was well in Lemuria and Atlantis for a long time, but slowly the imbalancesand pressures which continued to build up under the bombardment of the Lucifericconsciousness began to tell. Over aeons of existence, the Lucifericconsciousness had learned how best to disrupt harmony and how to imbalance otheraspects by working through their emotional levels. The production of negativeenergy by whatever means available was the motivation because such negativeenergy feeds it and gives it greater power. The reason for conflict wasirrelevant as long as there was conflict and a production line of negativeenergy. Planets were destroyed, either by direct intervention from Lucifer or byhis thought patterns scrambling the consciousness of others. A planet known bythe Sumerians as Maldek was destroyed by nuclear explosion created by scientistswho had the knowledge without the wisdom. (See Allan & Delair’s When The EarthNearly Died). Some of the debris of that planet and others is still flyingaround the solar system in forms we call asteroids and comets. Some of thedebris is held in the rings of Saturn. Too incredible to accept? Look what weare doing to this planet. We are destroying her by the way in which we behaveand that is what has happened elsewhere, either through exploitation, nuclearexplosions, or by the poisoning of the atmosphere in some other way. Hashumanity as a whole been under the influence of a force for good? No. Exactly.The time arrived when Luciferic extra-terrestrials sought to take over theplanet and wars were fought between the, by now, countless extra-terrestrialcivilisations that wished to either help or exploit this world. The harmony ofearly Atlantis had long gone. The Earth which was created as the planet ofbalance and a generator of love began to pour out negative energy into thesystem. Things were going terribly wrong and it was having a serious affect onthe mind of the planet, the consciousness we call Mother Nature, the EarthSpirit, or Gaia. The Earth is the dense physical body of this mind and we allexist within her energy field, her aura. When humanity creates negative energyshe absorbs it and, through her, it is exported to the solar system, theUniverse, and beyond. Lucifer turned his negative power on the Earth Spirit,working to disrupt her on all levels by imbalancing her energy fields –especially her mind and emotions. His thought patterns worked on her emotionsboth directly and by affecting her physical form. When our bodies are giving uspain it affects our emotions. A planet consciousness is no different. Theextra-terrestrial volunteers who agreed to restore harmony and to raiseconsciousness on the physical level found themselves facing an enormouschallenge from other extra-terrestrial sources who came to the planet in theirenormous spacecraft. Many were so affected that they, also, began to work forthe negative forces.Knowledge is neutral. It is how you use it that is positive or negative. Thosewho understood the use of energies and the power of crystals were known inAtlantis and Lemuria as the Guardians of the Light and the Keepers of the SecretKnowledge. Only those who, it was felt, could be trusted to use the knowledgepositively were told of its secrets. However, here we had a situation where thepower of the Lucifer influence was such that many of these people had becomeseriously imbalanced. As a consequence, knowledge which was potentially lethalwas falling into the wrong hands. Many Atlanteans began to use their knowledgein highly negative ways as did the extra-terrestrials who hijacked Atlantis.For hundreds of thousands of years during Atlantis and earlier,extra-terrestrials from various universal civilisations had been seeding thehuman race and advancing the physical form. Some did this for positive reasons,some with their own agenda in mind. The themes of this are documented in ancienttexts and on clay tablets written some 6,000 years ago by the Sumerians. TheSumer records speak of ‘gods’ coming down from the sky to impregnate women andthen returning to the stars. The human form as we know it, Homo Sapiens Sapiensto give it its full title, did not evolve from the ape family but from otheruniversal civilisations around 20,000 years or so before the final cataclysmsank what remained of Atlantis about 10,000BC. In fact, the ape family came fromthe impregnation of animal forms by ETs as part of their experimentation.Scientists talk of the ‘missing link’ between Neanderthal man and the presenthuman body, but they will never find it, because it doesn’t exist. The suddenevolutionary advance in the human form came from the intervention ofextra-terrestrials, some positive in their intent, some negative.The Sumer records say that a ‘god’ called Ea was involved in this geneticengineering. They say he had a half-brother called En-lil and, as we will see,these were two of the Sumer ‘gods’ that would be passed on into the beliefsystems of religions to this day. Most of the early Old Testament stories comefrom Sumer or earlier and relate to this time towards the end of Atlantis whennegative ETs were largely in control. A Sumerian ‘hymn’ has been discoveredwhich describes the tree of life, the fruit of which the gods had forbidden Manto eat. This tree was in the Garden of Edinnu, a word which means plain. In thisgarden, according to the hymn, you would find the god, Ea. How short a step thisis to Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden in the Bible. The Sumer depiction ofthe Garden of Edinnu even included a snake curled around a tree. The Garden ofEdinnu and its recycled version, the Garden of Eden, are highly symbolic of whatwas happening from the later Atlantis period and is still happening today. Adamand Eve (symbolising Earth Man and Woman) were told not to eat from the tree ofknowledge. In other words, they were to be kept in ignorance so that they wouldnot learn of their true nature. This is a theme which has continued throughouthuman history up to the present day. I call it ‘the Mushroom Approach’ – keepthem in the dark and feed them bullshit.According to William Bramley, in his book The Gods of Eden, the serpent in theAdam and Eve story is symbolic of something called the Brotherhood of the Snake(or serpent) which he believes was set up to give spiritual knowledge to anignorant humanity by those who wished to help them. Bramley’s research leads himto suggest that the ‘god’ known as Ea, or Prince of Earth, by the Sumerians whohelped to create and genetically engineer the new human form, did not wish tosee them mentally, spiritually, and physically imprisoned. He did someless-than-advisable things himself, Bramley believes, but he was genuine in hisdesire to challenge this oppression. Unfortunately, the highly negative,Lucifer-controlled ETs were so hostile to this that the serpent or snake becamesynonymous with evil and Ea, the ‘Prince of the Earth’ became known as thePrince of Darkness. It was nothing more or less than the kind of characterassassination, fuelled by lies and propaganda, which we see going on all thetime in the modern world.Those who have read the Adam and Eve story will recall that the serpent,symbolic of Ea, in Bramley’s view, did not have the opportunity to persuade themto eat from another tree, the Tree of Life. He was stopped. William Bramleybelieves that the Brotherhood of the Snake was eventually taken over by thenegative ETs and used for their own purposes – to keep the knowledge secret fromthe mass of the people and to pass it on only to an elite who could be trustedto support the ‘great work’ of world control and domination. These would beleaders of the people, such as kings and priests, in the civilisations thatwould follow Atlantis. The aim was to disconnect the conscious level of ourbeing from our higher levels to such an extent that our Earth consciousnesswould be trapped in the dense physical world and be unable to escape and evolve.Eternal slaves is what they wished to create according to Bramley. I don’t knowif his interpretations of the Sumer stories are correct in detail, but I have noproblem with the idea of an ET involvement on Earth during Atlantis and before.I have long believed that extra-terrestrials seeded the present human form. Thisis where the different races originally came from, with their many colours andfeatures. Those ETs seeking to help humanity to advance have been seeding humanbodies in order to make genetic improvements and to make it easier for thespirit to express its full potential. Put simply, the human form has beensubjected to a sort of genetic tug-of-war. I also feel that an organisation,which I will call the Brotherhood, has been used over thousands of years tomanipulate the human race, and never more so than today.The extreme negativity which prevailed on the Earth in the latter periods ofAtlantis had other implications. Every living form has an energy system, a webof lines linking with the chakras to maintain the flow of lifeforce energies.Acupuncture is based on this understanding. Its practitioners call the linesmeridians and the same system applies to planets. A planet has chakras and agrid of energy lines known, depending on your preference, as meridians, leylines or dragon lines. If you damage and disrupt this energy grid enough you candestroy a planet in the same way that a human body dies when its energy systemis sufficiently imbalanced. The basis of acupuncture is to keep the human systemin harmony and the physical body healthy. Acupuncture needles are employed torebalance and redirect the flow of energy. There are certain points, known asacupuncture points, where this can be done most efficiently. So it is with theEarth.Misuse of knowledge began to threaten this energy grid. Those Atlanteans whowere still holding on to the values that brought them here were guided by thehigher levels to turn down the power of the energies flowing through and aroundthe planet. The more powerful the energies, the greater was the potential forcreation or, should they be misused, for catastrophe. Most Atlanteans were, bynow, out of control and the only way to prevent them from destroying the Earthwas to reduce the power and potential of the energies available to them. Thespacecraft that come to the planet use these energy lines for their power and,if the power is reduced, you reduce the potential for harnessing that power fornegative reasons. A piece of channelled information I used in my book TruthVibrations explained it like this:“In the Atlantean period there were many energies being used and information andknowledge being used which were for particular reasons of safety withdrawn,shall we say, to prevent complete catastrophe, to prevent total destruction ofyour planet. One could say these were sort of emergency measures, if you like,to prevent the inhabitants of this planet from an untimely destruction”.I believe that the story of King Arthur and Merlin is, at least in part, asymbolic tale of this turning-down of the energies. I feel these tales relate toAtlanteans and only became legends of knights and kings much later when thesekind of stories would have been more readily understood by those they weredesigned to inform. This also applies to many of the stories in ancient textswhich became the Bible. The King Arthur story was, you might say, a sort ofparable. The sword Excalibur, I feel, is symbolic of the turning off of thosepowerful energies – the ‘dragon energies’ as some people call them. Legend hasit that the sword (the energies) was fixed into a stone and only one person hadthe gifts to remove it. Put another way, only someone with the correct energypattern can unlock the vibratory key to release the energies which have laindormant since Atlantis. This process is happening today. ‘Excalibur’ is beingremoved and unleashed across the planet. This is being done primarily in Britainand Ireland because this was where the big switch-off was achieved all thosethousands of years ago. However, many other locations on the planet areinvolved, too. The Earth’s energy field is now being prepared for its imminentevolution to a higher frequency as the period of Luciferic opportunity comes toan end. The channelled explanation went on:“As in your human body, there are energy lines around your planet, through yourplanet, which correspond, I suppose, very much to the acupuncture lines andmeridians in your body. Where two lines cross, you create a vortex, a tinyvortex if it’s two. The more lines that intersect, the bigger the vortex.Therefore when you have a chakra you have a large vortex of intersecting energy.It is the same with your planet. Where most lines cross there is the biggestvortex. Now you could say that the plexus (network) in and around the Islandsyou call the British Isles is the hub of the wheel of plexuses and energieswhich surround your planet. It has acted in other times like a fail-safe device.In order to activate these chakric points upon your planet, the energies mustall pass through the central point. They must pass through the heart of thepattern.”The number of those who had the knowledge of this central point and how to closeit down were very few. The keys to this point were “a consciousness pattern, aseries of harmonic equations, known only to the keepers of that pattern.”My belief is that the energies that were switched off, or at least massivelyturned down, were, in part, the Earth’s kundalini energies. These energies inthe base chakra, often symbolised by the snake, serpent or dragon, are a seat ofour power. The Atlanteans knew how to work with this power but, as with allthings, power can be used constructively or destructively. In their later daysthey chose destruction and the source of their power had to be removed. Thesuppressing of the kundalini flow obviously had great emotional, physical andmental effects on the Earth as a physical and spiritual entity and the power andknowledge within her aura (the energies we live within and are part of) wasconsequently diminished. In evolutionary terms, the Earth Spirit and humanitywent backwards. At the time that Yeva channelled the information about humanitygiving the Luciferic consciousness the chance to re-balance itself, she was alsoshown a symbolic vision of how this has affected human evolution. She saw theenergy stream of evolution going forwards and then suddenly turning back onitself before returning to the starting point, so completing a large loop. It iswithin that symbolic loop that the period of Luciferic opportunity has unfolded.We are now coming back to the point where it all began in terms of ourevolution. When the loop is complete, the period of opportunity will be over andwe will continue our evolution without the extreme negative influence of theLuciferic disruption.Once the harmonic ‘key’ was turned at the end of Atlantis, the power no longerexisted for the imbalanced Atlanteans to destroy everything. The vibratory ratefell and the density of the planet increased. The Earth was falling down thewavelengths of consciousness and disconnecting from a powerful link with higherlevels of being. With every fall, the levels of understanding, knowledge andwisdom available to the human race were correspondingly reduced. This, for me,is what is really meant by the Fall of Man. It is the fall down the frequenciesof knowledge and wisdom into denser matter. As the fall continued, humanity‘forgot’ about Atlantis because we were falling further and further away inconsciousness terms from the frequency on which all that happened. With thefrequencies rising today, we will be remembering more and more about Atlantis asthe fall is reversed and the Earth’s kundalini and other energies arere-released.The behaviour of the Atlanteans and the efforts of the Luciferic consciousnessso affected the Earth’s energy field that Atlantis was sunk in stages bycolossal earthquakes, volcanoes and tidal waves. It could well be that at leastthe final cataclysms were caused by a rebalancing beam passing across the Earth,which I will explain more fully in a moment. The effect of this ‘photon beam’,as some people call it, is to rebalance energy fields. If an energy field isfundamentally out of balance the rebalancing process can create staggeringphysical and mental effects. I’m sure that some kind of nuclear war broke out,too, and that the Earth was also hit during the destruction of Atlantis by alarge piece of debris, possibly part of the remains of Maldek. The energies areelectromagnetic and different energy fields attract or repel each other. Likeattracts like in these circumstances. So, if the Earth’s energy field goesthrough a highly negative phase, it is more likely to attract to itself othernegative fields – like the debris careering around the galaxy. I feel that,among the planets, at least the Moon and Venus have ‘gone walkabout’ beforedropping into their present orbits. This would clearly have caused fantasticupheavals as they shattered the balance within the energy fields of otherplanets and star systems. This series of incredible geological events in severaldistinct phases caused, no doubt, by a variety of reasons, ended thecivilisation called Atlantis. Researchers have found evidence of a 10,000ftuplift in the Andes about ten thousand years ago. This is because whole mountainranges soared from the surface of the Earth during these periods. There was amagnetic pole shift and a tilt of the Earth on its axis. This sent a fantastictidal wave around the planet. The giant crystal at the centre of the Atlanteanpower system was lost under the ocean and it is this which might be creating thestrange phenomenon known as the Bermuda Triangle. From time to time, it mightopen a gateway from one dimension to another. Other planets of this solar systemwhich were highly imbalanced went through similar upheavals and all hell brokeloose across a wide area. It seems to me that the Earth fell out of alignment,in some way, with the universal energy grid.The turning down of the energy points and the vibratory ‘fall’ trapped theAtlantean consciousness within the Earth’s frequencies and many who could haveescaped chose, for various reasons, to stay and carry on the work. To do this,they had to begin the cycle of incarnating from the Earth’s non-physicalfrequencies into the human form. This process included the volunteers who werestill on the path and those who had either been led astray by the LucifericConsciousness or were aspects of that consciousness. Other volunteers could notstand the falling frequencies and left before it was too late. The Earth’svibration and atmosphere became much denser and the light/dark struggle wouldmanifest in a different way. I am not sure exactly why, but from now on the ETpresence on Earth, both negative and positive, would take another form. Most oftheir influence was spread by affecting human consciousness through plantingideas, beliefs, and thought patterns. I do think that they still came in theirspacecraft to observe, support, or manipulate depending on their state of being,but it was mostly done in much more subtle ways and was very different from theAtlantis and pre-Atlantis times. Since the end of Atlantis, those who continuedto work for the evolution of the planet and humanity have been incarnating tospread the spiritual truths and prepare thè World for today’s great time ofchange. As a channelled communication said:“There are many of you for whom the Earth is not your indigenous evolutionaryhome, shall we say. There are many of you on this planet who come from otherspheres of evolution. I think these have been called ‘star children’ by some ofyour writers, that is a good enough expression. More evolved beings came to yourplanet and manifested on your planet in Atlantean times. This was the biggestimpulse in bringing the new knowledge into Atlantis which caused it to grow intothe civilisation that it was. New knowledge was brought into this system fromuniversal sources from highly evolved spirits, bringing knowledge into theplanet. And you’re going to bring it back, basically.”A plan was set in motion to restore the Earth after Atlantis. This plan hadthree main motivations:To help the Luciferic consciousness to re-harmonise before its ‘opportunity’period came to an end,To seek to protect human consciousness from further imbalance,To check the fall of the Earth’s energy field to ever lower vibrations.This final point is crucial to what is happening on the planet today. Creationis self-balancing. You can push it out of balance for a certain period but thenit kicks back to find harmony. This loop of opportunity for the Lucifericconsciousness had a definite time scale and now, in the lifetimes of ourgenerations, it is coming to a close. It is time for Planet Earth to return toits original evolutionary road.Everything from the inside of an atom to a universe is in orbit around a centralpoint. Some researchers believe that our solar system, together with a muchwider area, is in orbit around the star system known as the Pleiades. Accordingto the writer Paul Otto Hesse, this orbit is centred in particular aroundAlcyone, the brightest star in the Pleiades. Some people say it takes 24,000years for our sun to complete such an orbit. Hesse believes that it is fromAlcyone and the Pleiades that the Photon Belt I have mentioned is projected. Itis a beam of highly charged energy particles that rebalances and re-synchronisesall energy fields that pass through it. I use the term Photon Belt forsimplicity, but that term, and the location of Alcyone, are Hesse’s research,not mine. I know it only as a synchronisation beam and have no idea of its exactcomposition nor from where it emanates. But the effect is the same: Fantastictransformation.As the beam is a circle, each orbit of our solar system around Alcyone (if thatis correct) possibly takes us through the beam twice. It is estimated that ittakes around 2,000 years to pass completely through it. No matter what state ofimbalance a planet may be experiencing, the passage through the photon beam willre-balance it at the vibratory level most appropriate to its evolution. Thevital point, however, is that the more imbalanced a planet’s energy field iswhen it enters that beam, the more disruption and upheaval will be caused in there-balancing process. It is that potentially cataclysmic upheaval that thevolunteer consciousness has been trying to avoid by working to check thegathering imbalances caused by the Luciferic consciousness. You can see, giventhe potential consequences, what an act of love it has been for the human mindto offer this opportunity to that consciousness.The planet has already experienced the great upheaval which marked the end ofAtlantis and it could happen again if we don’t flood the Earth’s energy fieldwith love. The Photon Belt acts as a sort of harvester, giving the opportunityto those who are ready to move out of this level of existence to graduate to ahigher one. During the Atlantean period it is possible that it re-balanced theEarth’s energy field.[../Images/01.jpg]THE PLEIDIAN SYSTEM: Alcyone is the brightest star in the constellation ofPleiades. Our sun takes 24,000 years to complete a full revolution aroundAlcyone.The Earth, while being rebalanced, did not herself take that evolutionary leapbecause it was not the right time. She could not have done so, anyway, with herenergy field weakened by the switching off of certain key energy flows. Now thetime is right for the Earth to make that evolutionary step and return to whereshe was before the Luciferic opportunity period began. In other words, theevolutionary ‘loop’ is being completed and the Earth is returning to heroriginal evolutionary path. I think the same is true of the solar system andfurther afield. The Luciferic opportunity is coming to a close. The pass acrossthe photon beam which is happening now will, I feel, be potentially morefar-reaching in its effect than it was even during Atlantis. This time the wholeenergy field of Planet Earth is being ‘harvested’ and it is taking a massivestep up in its evolution. Those who do not do the same will not be able toincarnate on the Earth after this process is complete because the Earth will beoperating on too high a frequency for them to exist here until they have raisedtheir own vibrations to match those of this planet.The idea of this re-balancing beam was identified by the Maya people more than athousand years ago. When the Mayan Civilisation was at the height of its powersin Central America between around 435AD and 850AD, they were well ahead oftoday’s mainstream science in their understanding of Creation. This was becausethey, too, were, in part, an incarnation of the advanced volunteerconsciousness. They would have channelled other frequencies and possiblyinteracted with space visitors. They knew of these beam cycles crossing theEarth and produced a system of numbers and symbols to measure these periods.According to the calculations the Maya left behind on their magnificent pyramidsand temples, the current ‘great cycle’ of the Earth’s evolution began in 3113BCand will end in the year 2012. This corresponds with the prophecies of otherssuch as Nostradamus who foresaw enormous change in this period, as one era ofhuman evolution passed and another made its entrance.The year 2012 is when those who follow the Mayan calculations believe thatPlanet Earth will be re-synchronised. Different people put different time scaleson these things, but they all agree on the basic period. My feeling is that the‘window’ of time in which we will see the most dramatic change is between the1990s and circa 2030. I will give more details of the effects of this periodwhen we reach the present day in our chronological story. I felt it was worthmapping out the basic themes, however, at this early stage because it will helpto put into context much of what our story will describe. All over the Universeare other highly-evolved civilisations working to help humanity and the Earth.Some of their number come into incarnation, others travel here in spacecraft,and still others operate as channelled communicators to Earth people. Theseother civilisations have evolved to the point where they can think asindividuals or link their minds collectively, so accessing all the knowledge andwisdom available in the sum total of the parts. Guiding the overall operation isa Galactic and Universal consciousness which is given many names by channellers.This is the consciousness which is guiding the Earth and those in incarnationwho are here to serve the Universe by serving humanity and the planet. Thatconsciousness will, in turn, be guided by the Source.Against this line-up of love, however, are aspects of the Lucifericconsciousness which also manifest in physical bodies, ETs, and as channelledcommunicators. These are guided by their version of a Universal consciousnesswhich is in opposition to the Source and seeks to undermine the efforts of allthose who wish to open the prison door for both humanity and the Earth. For manythousands of years, the evolution of Planet Earth has been dominated by thestruggle between these two states of being, harmony and disharmony. Thanks tothe re-balancing beam there can be only one winner – harmony. But this does notdiminish the horrors which disharmony has visited, upon the world."},{"pageContent":"2Collective AmnesiaTHE Earth took a long time to recover from the cataclysms and, even when thephysical surface began to heal, it was now a very different world.Gone was the knowledge that built Atlantis, because the frequency ofconsciousness that could be accessed on Earth was much lower and more primitivethan it had been. The energy field had been re-balanced but the energies hadcome to rest, as it were, at a much lower frequency than they had once enjoyed.In vibratory terms it was like incarnating into treacle. It was even moredifficult for those highly-evolved minds who were still working for therestoration of the planet to manifest that understanding while encased in adense physical body. Their bodies were now denser than they had been in Atlantisand the limitations were subsequently greater than they had been used to. Thepower and potential of the energies around the planet were similarly curtailed.All this made the task of those incarnating to help the Earth immeasurably moredemanding.The events at the end of Atlantis had attracted large numbers of beings to thisarea of Creation to help with the plan. The Earth’s energy field had to beprepared for the next crossing of the Photon Belt when it would return to itsoriginal evolutionary level and beyond. Other volunteers began to incarnate onto the Earth. But this dense physical frequency and many others continued to bedominated by the Luciferic disruption. That consciousness as expressed throughnegative ETs had been largely removed from the physical level of the planet bythe rebalancing process but now it began to stimulate disharmony again. Thelower frequency made this easier, if anything, and disharmony in the planet’senergy field gathered pace as the Luciferic consciousness entered the last stageof its ‘opportunity’ period – an opportunity it showed no signs of taking. Ionce had a vision of the Earth which took the form of a ball of glass like theones you see hanging from the ceiling in discos and dance halls. As the ballspun, it was reflecting light in all directions. I believe this was symbolic ofthe role the Earth plays. But, instead of sending out light and love, she hasbeen generating negative energy. She has become like a negativity productionunit which is imbalancing and holding back the evolution of the solar system andall that is currently entering the Photon Belt and preparing to evolve. This isbeing made more difficult by the drag and disharmony of the Earth and thefrequencies that surround her. This is creating vibratory pressures and tensionswhich are reaching a critical point. One piece of channelled information I usedin Truth Vibrations said:“The Universe needs the life the Earth brings forth and the whole must bepreserved. It is not for you alone that we do this work. There has always beenan order in the way the planets have been governed. Man has not understood thelinkages which bind everything together.”This is another reason why the volunteer consciousness is focusing on PlanetEarth. What happens here affects a much wider area. All planets and stars areconnected by a web of energy lines to a universal grid. If a chakra or pulsepoint on this grid is damaged or starts to generate imbalanced energies, itaffects everything connected to that grid. These can eventually affect otherfrequencies and the imbalance can grow like a cancer. It has become clear to meover these years of my spiritual reawakening that, if the Earth goes on beingabused, so much negative energy will be created that the consequences for thewider Universe could be very unpleasant as it goes through its evolutionaryleap.The imbalances and density of the Earth affect humanity in many ways. It isworth repeating here that not all of our consciousness incarnates into aphysical body and becomes subject to its severe limitations. The higher levelsof our consciousness (higher self) stay on a non-physical level and guide thelower self through an incarnation. The higher self knows the lifeplan – what wehope to achieve and experience during that life. If, however, we lose touch withthe higher self, Mission Control, we become dominated by the information comingin through the eyes and the ears and we are prey to the thought patternsdirected at this level by the Luciferic consciousness. These work particularlyon the emotions and the ego and, once the Lucifer patterns have control ofthose, they can, by affecting our behaviour, cause untold pain and destruction.This is what has happened to the human race. We can come into incarnation withthe best of intentions but, once we look out through our eyes and becomesubjected to all the information this level constantly bombards us with, we canforget why we are here and act in ways that are the exact opposite of what weintended before incarnation. This is especially so if the kundalini energies aresuppressed because, in that state of being, the other chakras are not linkedpowerfully to the physical level. Thus, the physical is not fully connected toour higher levels. (The source of the kundalini energy is the base of the spine,the seat of our sexuality and of harmonious relationship.)It can be even worse if a higher self is working from one of the non-physicalfrequencies still dominated by that Luciferic consciousness. In these cases, youhave a misguided lower self and a misguided higher self. There are also directincarnations of the Lucifer consciousness. Look back through history and aroundthe world today and you will see many examples of this. The imbalances of theEarth, its density and a suppressed or imbalanced kundalini flow, make theconnection and communication between higher and lower self much more difficultduring an incarnation. With the influence of ‘Mission Controls’ getting weaker,lower selves come under the control of eyes and ears information. If Lucifer canmanipulate that information and fill the human mind with negative thoughtpatterns, it follows that he could encourage humanity to act in ways thatgenerate yet more negative energy into the ocean of consciousness in which weexist. More negative energy increases the power of the Luciferic consciousness.We can feel these energies when we meet someone and say, ‘Hey, I got bad vibesfrom him’. Or, perhaps, we go into a house and say, ‘I don’t like it in here –it’s eerie’. At these times we are feeling the non-physical energy generated bya person or by others in the past. What we call atmosphere is really the energy,negative or positive, generated by human beings or non-physical entities. Theatmosphere we describe at football matches, for instance, is made up of theenergies generated by the crowd.Since the end of Atlantis, the imbalances have been fuelled both by the thoughtpatterns transmitted by the Luciferic consciousness and by the negative energiesgenerated by humanity. As a result, the Earth has become subjected to an evermore serious negative imbalance which has led to the state of the world we seetoday. Lucifer has sought to control the information and thought patterns of thedense physical level to such an extent that whoever incarnated on to the Earthwould become subjected to those patterns and to the influence of the peoplealready affected by them. A simple example of this is can be found in parentscontrolled or strongly influenced by the Lucifer thought patterns whoindoctrinate their children to think in the same way. Once control of the humanmind has been largely accomplished at the collective level, each successivegeneration has faced pressure to conform to that way of thinking.Every species has, as I have outlined, a collective mind, a level to which allminds in incarnation are linked. It has been shown that, once a certain numberof a species learns to do something new, suddenly other members of the samespecies are able to do the same thing without being shown. This so-called‘Hundredth Monkey Syndrome’ is the collective mind at work. Once enoughindividual minds start thinking in a particular way, their thought patternsbecome strong enough in the collective mind for other individuals to access thatinformation. That’s how the Hundredth Monkey Syndrome works. With Lucifertransmitting thought patterns into the collective mind and using billions ofdense physical bodies over the centuries to do the same, it is not difficult tosee how the illusions and misunderstandings of humanity have arisen and becomeso powerful.There were three tasks which those who had come to the Earth needed to performin order to restore harmony. One was to create a temporary energy grid on theplanet to replace the one devastated during Atlantis; the second was to restoreand re-open that Atlantis energy system when the time was right and re-awakenthe closed-down energies before the Earth’s evolutionary leap during the presentpass of the Photon Belt; and the third was to give human beings as muchinformation as possible to help them to remember who they really were and whatthey had come to do. If it was difficult for humanity’s higher selves tocommunicate with them, this problem could be by-passed, to some extent, by usingthose who did maintain a good connection to bring information directly to thisdense physical level. Also, everyone who changed their thinking in the light ofthis information would be sending thought patterns into the collective mind tochallenge the Lucifer domination.These efforts were made more difficult by the way the frequency had fallen andby the nature of the imbalances it was subject to. On this frequency werenegative emotions and mental states of a scale and severity that these evolvedvolunteers had never experienced directly before. If the personnel were to becapable of playing their part in those generations at the end of the 20thcentury, they had to have mastered, to a large extent, the emotions,temptations, illusions and fears so prevalent on the Earth. If they did not,they would be unable to do what was required and the transition period would beeven more traumatic and difficult than it already promised to be. As well ascoming into incarnation to pass on information and work on the energy grid,these beings also had to be put through lives that would give them experience ofsome very unpleasant emotions. Only in this way could they learn to overcomethem. Sometimes they would have lives in which they worked almost exclusively onthe energy system and on the spreading of information; sometimes they would havelives designed primarily to experience negative emotions and overcome them.Mostly their lives were a combination of both.Over the thousands of years since the destruction of Atlantis, those working forthe restoration of the planet have been incarnating over and over again and, inthat process, have been amassing karmic debt which has had to be balanced out.Some became so affected by the pressures of this level that they no longerfollowed the path they had embarked upon after Atlantis. They came to free theprisoners and ended up in jail themselves, trapped by the pressures and desiresof the dense physical world and undermined by the Luciferic consciousness whichseeks to stop the volunteers, in particular. Most of them have been historicallyanonymous, living simple lives and being guided to work on the energy system.Many of the great stone circles and the standing stones of the world were builteither by, or under the direction of, these people. Pyramids and the stones arethe physical manifestation of the work that went on thousands of years ago toconstruct a sort of makeshift energy grid to keep the Earth ticking over untilthe Atlantean one could be reactivated in our lifetimes. They would have sensedthe energies and been guided to do what was required because the energyimbalances at that time were not as great as they would later become and theconnection with the higher self would have been potentially more powerful. Alsoevery effort is made by other levels to make the higher self/lower selfconnection of certain key people as strong as it can possibly be when particulartasks need to be achieved.Pyramid geometry is such that it has a very significant effect on energy flows,negative or positive depending on how they are used, while the stone circles andstanding stones act like fuse boxes and acupuncture needles receiving energiesfrom the universal grid and rebalancing the flows. If you look back at anycivilisation which was more evolved than the rest of the world, you will belooking at either a group incarnation of those who volunteered to help the Earthor at the effects of spaceship landings or channelled information which passedon the knowledge. That doesn’t mean that the volunteers were perfect. They weresubject to the pressures of this world, also. And what is perfect, anyway? Butthey were in close enough synchronisation with their higher self for knowledgeto reach this level which helped the earth and human understanding.When I say that the volunteer consciousness incarnated into certaincivilisations, I don’t mean that every member of that nation or race was thatconsciousness incarnate. Only some of them. These were the ones who accessed theinformation and understanding from higher levels which either helped thosecivilisations to evolve very quickly or challenged the political, economic andreligious dogma of their day. Around them there would have been people whoignored them or killed them for their ‘heresy’ as well as those who listened andsupported their views on how a society could best prosper in peace. That is thesituation in its most simplistic form. But, of course, it is more complex thanthat. Some of the volunteer consciousness has become imbalanced and is eithernot working for the good of the planet or is actively working against it. Someof the Luciferic consciousness will have been so affected by its experiencesthat it has rejected that negative influence. In most cases, people are affectedby both. No-one is all good or all negative. The question is which part of us isdominating our behaviour and to what degree?Extra-terrestrials continued to come to the Earth in this post-Atlantis period,and were considered to be gods by the Earth people. This is not surprising whenyou imagine what it must have been like for the primitive Earth people to beconfronted by spacecraft and their occupants. We should not underestimate thescale of the influence on human evolution on all levels, positive and negative,by other civilisations in the Universe. When you look through the Bible andother ancient texts you can see what appear to be spacecraft described. The Bookof Ezekiel is a prime example and, indeed, there is an analysis of this calledThe Space Ships Of Ezekiel by Josef F. Blumrich, a former chief of systemslayout at NASA. His work strongly suggests that a number of biblical texts aredescribing spacecraft. Analysis of many ancient writings and the artwork ofpeoples all over the world also appears to contain descriptions of such craftand their occupants, who were thought to be ‘gods from the sky’. Ancient IndianSanskrit texts speak of gods who fought in aircraft and certainly the Book ofEzekiel leaves you in little doubt of what was being described:“Now as I looked upon the living creatures, I saw four wheels upon the ground,one by each of the living creatures, with their four faces.The appearance of the wheels and their composition was like the colour of shinyamber; and all four wheels had one likeness; and their appearance and theircomposition was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel…“And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them; and when theliving creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.“And the appearance of the sky upon the heads of the living creatures wasreflected as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched over their headsabove…“And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of greatwaters, as the voice of the Almighty, like the din of an army. When they stoodstill, they lowered their wings. And there was a voice from the crystal coveringthat was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings.”Ezekiel 1:1-25The Babylonians had a god called Oannes, a fishtailed amphibious being who,according to their legends, came to Earth to start a civilisation. Some peoplelook at the primitive way of life on the planet during these periods and laughat the idea of highly-evolved spacecraft landing here. But people from thecomputerised, technological, western culture today visit parts of the world thatstill live more or less as the ancients did. No-one finds that funny or hard toaccept. The only difference between that and what I am suggesting aboutspacecraft is that, in the extra-terrestrial case, the technological culturevisiting a more primitive one is interplanetary rather than intercontinental.We will pick up the story of what happened to humanity after Atlantis in thefertile land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. This area became known asMesopotamia and is now Iraq. Here the Sumerian people settled and were supportedby visitations from many extra-terrestrial peoples, some to help, some toexploit. Official history dates this period from around 4,000BC, but it wasprobably much earlier. The Sumerians were said to have built the first cities ofthe post-Atlantis era, but there were many other civilisations before that. Onewas in Israel, around Jericho, for sure. According to Sumerian records preservedon baked bricks, they themselves came to the area with a knowledge of writing,the arts, agriculture and metalwork. I am sure that the knowledge contained intheir writings and artifacts came to them from earlier civilisations thathistory hasn’t yet recorded. The Sumerians used their agricultural skills andthe rich silt left by the rivers in times of flood, to grow two crops of wheateach year. A culture developed that was, as far as we know, well ahead of mostof the planet at that time. A library of more than 30,000 written tablets wascreated and the discovery of some of these has given us an understanding of theSumerian background and history. Some of the symbols found on Sumerian artifactscorrespond with those in the crop circles that appear in the fields of southernEngland and elsewhere today.The two main cities of Mesopotamia were Eridu, the capital of Sumer, and Nippurto the North, the capital of Akkad, which was inhabited by a Semitic race. Thetwo cities had very different religious beliefs and cultures. Eridu worshippedthe God, Ea, while En-lil was the God of Nippur. Later the Arabian word, Allah,would devolve from En-lil, as would the Hebrew word for God, El, who was also tobecome the Christian God. I have no doubt that Ea and En-lil wereextra-terrestrials from that earlier period we talked about. By now they hadentered Sumerian legends as ‘gods’. Extra-terrestrials and the psychicchannellings and visions which people experienced were the foundations of thereligions that would follow, right up to the present day. Not all the gods camefrom these sources. Some were just made up or the product of confused minds butmost were ET or psychic in their origins.Look at the implications for the Bible and other ‘holy’ books of the themesemerging in our story so far. The judgmental god so widely quoted in the OldTestament and other ancient texts, who threatens to bring horrors upon humanbeings if they don’t do as he tells them, merely reflects the attitudes of thenegative ETs or channelled entities. They are not the words of God but those ofthe extra-terrestrials and channelled entities who were thought to be gods. Goto church and worship an ET! The idea that God created humans in his own imagewould describe perfectly the seeding of the human form as we know it byextra-terrestrials considered to be gods.I stress here that, when truths were passed on, they were communicated in wayswhich the people of the time could understand. From the symbolic explanations ofthousands of years ago have come the religious dogmas as the symbolism has beentaken literally and added to or changed around. When ancient texts say clearly,‘This story is a parable’, religions accept the tale as symbolic but many takeeverything else in the text literally. In fact, most of these texts are symbolicand told in parable form. I use a lot of symbolic explanations in my books whichrelate to what people today experience and easily identify with. It has alwaysbeen like that. So there are still truths in the Bible and many other ancienttexts despite what the religions have done to destroy and debase them. But thesetruths and the mathematical codes they also contain will never be understood ifthey continue to be taken literally rather than symbolically; nor whilereligions continue to proclaim that everything written in them is one hundredper cent accurate and the infallible word of God when a goodly proportion isclearly invented claptrap passed on from one people to another through thecenturies.Religious dogma and myth have been used very successfully either to suppressunderstanding or to twist the truth sufficiently to turn something positive intosomething negative. The story of Adam and Eve is an example. It has been used toundermine women (Eve tempts Adam in the story to eat from the Tree of Knowledgeagainst the command of God, and so evil starts with the creation of women). Ithas also been used to justify the belief that we are all born sinners (ourancestral lines are all supposed to go back genetically to the original‘sinners’, Adam and Eve). This nonsense is still blindly followed today tojustify some terrible behaviour. My goodness. God help us!To weave a way through this minefield we have to look at the symbolism in theSumerian stories and other ancient texts but not take them all literally. Eventhe symbolism is multi-dimensional. I don’t believe the symbolism of the snake,for example, relates entirely to the Garden of Edinnu or Eden. I feel that thesnake or serpent has been used as a symbol for many things. The Mesopotamianculture had a serpent-god called Ningishzida represented by two intertwiningsnakes. These are possibly symbolic of the two opposing forces,positive-negative, male-female, in balance within the kundalini energy as itrises through the central channel to connect and empower the chakras on thephysical level. Appropriately, though somewhat ironically, the symbol of themedical profession to this day is an intertwining snake. The symbol of modernmedicine represents knowledge of the physical body and the human energy fieldknown thousands of years ago, but now rejected by the very profession which hasthat knowledge in its symbol!Serpents and similar symbols have also been used throughout ancient cultures torepresent the Goddess or female polarity of Creation. The earlier concepts ofthe Trinity had a female symbol as one of the triangle of ‘gods’ while the moreenlightened religions speak of a Father/Mother God to highlight the need formale-female balance within both ourselves and the whole. The Christian versionof this idea of a Trinity – Father, Son and Holy Ghost – does not recognise thefeminine and that has been reflected in its attitude to women over thecenturies. All the ancient and more spiritually enlightened cultures like theSumerians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the native Americans (Indians), theAustralian aborigines and many of the East, knew of the importance of thekundalini and had initiations, often very tough ones, to speed the smoothactivation and empowerment of these energies. The snake and serpent were, moreoften than not, a representation of this. Similarly, their belief inresurrection or rebirth was often symbolised by the snake shedding its skin asit moved from one state of being into another.There were some periods of peace in Sumer, but it was also plagued by inter-citybattles and, gradually, the civilisation decayed and disappeared. This was to bea running theme through human evolution – the desire to impose beliefs or tosteal the benefits of an advanced culture, causing war after war and, thereby,destroying what human ingenuity and the volunteer consciousness had created. Itis also the case, as we will discuss more thoroughly later, that if you wish tocontrol people and stop them evolving spiritually then causing conflict betweenthem is an excellent way to achieve that aim. The culture of the Sumerians wasto influence others who began to develop in the region we call the Middle East.Sumerian beliefs and knowledge found their way to the Egyptians, Babylonians,Assyrians, Hebrews and, later, the Greeks. In turn, the Greeks would influencethe Romans and the Sumerians could fairly be said to have been the foundation ofmuch that would follow. Writing and such architectural constructions as the archand the dome first appear with the Sumerians in the post-Atlantis periodalthough these probably go back further to pre-Sumer times. The Hebrewsinherited many of their own beliefs from Mesopotamia and Egypt and these havebeen passed on through the generations as Judaism and, eventually, Christianity.The idea of the Sabbath comes from the Sumerians as does the Great Flood, theFall of Man and the laws that have been associated with Moses. One Sumeriantablet records the story of Creation which, in all its main themes, is the sameas that reported in Genesis.The God myths, largely, though not entirely, the result of ET and psychicactivities, were already well underway by Sumer times. Another Sumerian tablettells the story of Bel, which means the Son of God. Bel was to become thesaviour-myth figure of Babylon and would be known to the Hebrews as Baal. Bel,the Sumerian son of God, was the Lord Christ and redeemer in Babylonian thought.They believed he had died and risen again to ensure their salvation. Heard thatsomewhere before? The Babylonians performed a Passion drama and sang hymns thatwere very close to the Passion plays and services of the later Christians. Belwas the second in a trinity of gods – Ea, the Father; Bel, the Son, and Anu, theHoly Spirit. It was the custom to sacrifice a lamb to the gods because, as onetablet says, “The lamb is the substitute for humanity.” What is it that theBible tells us? “…the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.”The ‘lamb’ of the Bible is said to be Jesus, but that’s just a piece ofmyth-recycling. The basic story of Bel and other key elements of this Sumerianand Babylonian belief-system were taken back to Judea by the Jews after theywere freed from captivity in Babylon. They then found their way into the textsthat make up the Old Testament and, through them, into the New Testament. So wehave the Bible talking of Jesus as the Lamb of God dying so that our sins can beforgiven or, as they were saying thousands of years earlier in Mesopotamiaduring their animal sacrifices, ‘The lamb is the substitute for humanity’. OneSumerian tablet even records the story of how Sargon, the King of the Semites,was hidden by his mother in a basket made from bulrushes on the bank of theEuphrates, a tale attributed in the Bible to Moses. As we will see, the wholebasis of the Jewish, Christian and many other religions comes from storiesinherited over the centuries which each religion attributes to its ownparticular saviour-god. A number of these stories and myths will be symbolic ofactual events and eternal truths but their meaning, in most cases, has become sochanged, twisted or embellished that the understanding has been lost.I am not sure how much direct ET involvement went on in Sumer. I want to seemore information before I decide what I feel was happening. Obviously this partof the book, in terms of ET involvement, has to be a hypothesis, although onebased on much research by a number of people. It is possible that ETs were stillmaking themselves known to the population as a whole, or it could be they wereinteracting only with certain groups or individuals. But I don’t think it isalways as simple as ETs manifesting physically. I feel they operate mostly onother frequencies of reality which allow them to be seen only by those who canpsychically tune into them. They would certainly have been working through humanconsciousness and channellers, I would say, and having a considerable influenceon events.What I do feel on the balance of the evidence I have seen and my own intuition,is that the principle of initiating people into the eternal truths began to bemisused from at least this Sumer period onwards and probably much earlier. Ifyou remember, the channelling in the last chapter talked about the “Guardians ofthe Light” in Atlantis being given the knowledge of how to use and harness theenergies. This knowledge was kept secret because of the potential fordevastation if it was misused. At that time this initiation process was usedwith the best of intent. This process was, however, to become infiltrated underthe influence of the Luciferic consciousness and slowly, but surely, it spawnedthe enormous network of secret societies we see today, all with similar terms,symbols, and initiation proceedures. This network I will call the Brotherhood.I stress here that I am not suggesting all secret societies from this moment onwere of negative, manipulative, intent. Many continued to use the cover ofsecrecy in the centuries that followed, to pass on spiritual knowledge which wasbeing systematically destroyed in the outside world, and to speak openly aboutit would have been tantamount to suicide. The Brotherhood, where used tocommunicate the spiritual truths for the good of humanity in line with itsoriginal purpose, has made a vital contribution to keeping those truths alivethrough some very dark times. So it is no contradiction that some great peoplewho have served humanity well have been involved in Brotherhood secretsocieties, while the Brotherhood has also been used to manipulate humanityappallingly. It depends who is in control of the secret society at a particulartime. What I most strongly contend, however, is that from now onwards there wasa gradual takeover of the Brotherhood initiation process, until it became anoverwhelmingly negative influence on humanity and an enormously effectivevehicle for the Luciferic consciousness. I shall be charting this takeoverthrough the book and highlighting its fundamental effect today on everyone’slives. The difference between the original Brotherhood and the Luciferic versionis one of intent and method. The original passed on truths, or what weregenuinely perceived to be truths, to those it believed would use the knowledgewisely; the Luciferic version gives a twisted and manipulated version of thetruths to those it believes can be trusted to continue its ambitions to controlthe world.The Sumerian civilisation expanded and the famous city of Ur was built around3,500BC. Later, an event of some kind occurred which altered the course of theEuphrates and forced the people to move North to the river settlement known asBabylon, which means the Gate of the Gods. Internal strife weakened them andeventually the Amorites conquered the region and brought together Sumer andAkkad to form Babylonia. The Amorites were a Semitic race, a branch of whichbecame the Hebrews. King Hammurabi became the ruler of what was to be known asBabylonia and he instigated a system of laws and justice that were to be adaptedfor their own use by the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Education was available toall and everyone had the opportunity to learn to read and write. There werelibraries and universities.It is important to appreciate, as we look at where present-day values andbeliefs originated, that nothing is new. It is all inherited from, or influencedby, what has happened in the past. To say that the beliefs of Christianity werenew 2,000 years ago is simply ridiculous. Even the Christian ceremony called theEucharist, the eating of the body and the drinking of the blood, originates fromthe days of cannibalism. Today, Christians eat bread and drink red wine tosymbolise Christ’s body and blood. In the ceremonies from which this originated,they ate and drank the real thing in human and animal sacrifices! The Greekscalled it the Eucharistia.The Assyrians travelled three hundred miles to the south to invade and conquerBabylonia around 1280BC and, over the next 200 years or so, they extended theirempire across to the Mediterranean. After a period of internal war, theAssyrians invaded Egypt, but this campaign so exhausted them physically andfinancially that they were conquered by the Chaldeans who moved their centre toBabylon. The best known of the Chaldean kings was Nebuchadnezzar who reignedfrom 604 to 561BC and it was he who invaded through Judea to take command ofEgypt. Jews were taken captive and removed to Babylon where they were to haveaccess to the stories of Bel, the Son of God, and the other Mesopotamian beliefsI have been talking about.The next conquerors on the scene were the Persians who took Babylonia in 539BC.The Jews believed these invaders had been sent by their God, Jehovah, to freethem from captivity when, in fact, like so many other peoples, the Persiansmerely wished to extend their empire and steal all the booty they could find.The Jews had supported the Persians in their attack on Babylon and were allowedto return to Judea. They took with them the stories and beliefs they had heardin Babylon and this was to be a great influence on the emergence of both theJewish and Christian religions. The Persians had a belief in one God in contrastto the many-god religions that abounded among those people who believed thatdifferent gods were responsible for every facet of nature and the many ET andother ‘gods’ which became myth figures over the centuries. So, when all those‘gods’ became fused into the one God, he was an amalgamation of all thosedifferent myths and beliefs. No wonder the Bible is so contradictory.By 500BC the Persians controlled an area from Egypt to the borders of India.Communications improved with the building of the royal road from near thePersian Gulf almost to the Aegean Sea and Greeks began to travel south to visitBabylon. There they heard the stories of Bel and others and met with people fromIndia and Syria. Their knowledge and beliefs were exchanged and the fusion ofmyths continued apace."},{"pageContent":"3A Brotherhood of ClansEGYPT was another major influence on the pre-Christian world. The name means‘black land’ and refers to the silt left by the flooding Nile.Like Sumer, this civilisation grew from settlements on a major river where thefertility of the soil would ensure that there was enough to eat. Researchersbelieve the land was settled before 3,000BC and developed into a system ofPharaoh dynasties and dictatorships. I feel the Egyptian civilization goes backthousands of years earlier than this and new research is supporting thatcontention. There are some who believe that extra-terrestrials were very activein this region, at least in the early days. I have no problem in accepting thatthe culture was seriously influenced, either by legends and myths originatingfrom ET activity, or by the direct appearance on some level of spacecraft andtheir occupants, probably both. What form this interaction took, I’m not sure,and again ETs operate on many other levels of reality. If you look at many ofthe statues, artwork, and face make-up from early Egypt and Mesopotamia, theyoften emphasise large eyes. There are several civilisations elsewhere in theUniverse which have very large eyes when compared to ours. I am sure that someEgyptian ‘gods’ were extra-terrestrial in origin and the Egyptians said thatthese ‘gods’ went into the sky in their flying boats.There is a view among some researchers which says that ETs, some with ahuman-like form, came regularly to the Earth in these ancient times and beganthe tradition of god-kings in many civilisations which, in Egypt, manifested asthe Pharaohs. It is said that these kings were the human extension of negativeextra-terrestrial control and that the whole idea of a monarchy came from theirwish to manipulate humanity. The Pharaohs and kings were, according to thistheory, persuaded that they were different from the rest of humanity and therepresentatives of the gods (ETs) on earth. In fact, this belief systemcontends, the monarchs were puppets being used by some space people to keep themasses in ignorance and spiritual imprisonment. The monarchs, too, were connedand indoctrinated, it is said. I don’t know and have no way of knowing if thereis any truth in this, but I offer it to you as information and make of it whatyou will. I’ve put it all on the back burner for now with a great deal else, butit makes sense to me.One highly significant Pharaoh was Amenophis IV. About five years into his reignhe adopted the name Khu-n-aten and is now known as Akhenaton. He abolished idolsand the traditional multi-god religion and moved the capital from Thebes to anew city in Middle Egypt called El-Amarna. A Brotherhood temple was built therein the shape of a cross and he established the simple worship of the Sun God,Aten. Perhaps he realised the true significance of the Sun as a source ofknowledge and guidance, or possibly he was used by the Brotherhood to create anew one-god religion. Some researchers see him as a tool of the Brotherhoodinfiltrators who misled his people. Maybe he was. I don’t know the truth abouthim. Anyone can be manipulated; that is particularly true when you have leftthis physical level and can no longer challenge what is said and done in yourname. Look at the man we call Jesus! And as I keep stressing, secret societiescan be used for good or ill – it depends on who is in control and what societythey are operating in. The French Resistance in the Second World War was asecret society in a sense. I don’t believe it is wise to be black and white onthis as some researchers are. For instance, I believe that Akhenaton was right,there is only one God, one overall consciousness, but that doesn’t mean that Iagree with everything else he believed. We have to be selective and freeourselves from rigid dogma.What I do feel is that at least after the time of Akenaton the infiltration ofthe Brotherhood and its expansion did gather pace. When Akhenaton died in about1362BC his successors moved the court back to Thebes and reinstated themulti-god religions. One successor had a preference for the cult of the god Amenor Amun and he changed his name from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. He was tobecome world-famous thousands of years later when his tomb was uncovered in theValley of the Kings at Luxor. Akhenaton was to be branded a heretic. While thecourt was moved back to Thebes, the Brotherhood and its Mystery School of secretinitiations stayed put. It used the temple built by Akhenaton as itsheadquarters and, in doing so, broke away from the state hierarchy. FromEl-Amarna, agents of the Brotherhood were sent out to set up other branches farand wide. I believe that from this point, the Egyptian Brotherhood was probablyworking with less than positive intent and the expansion of the infiltrated,Luciferic version would now begin to spread its influence and manipulation. Eachof the Brotherhood priests at El-Amarna had a bald spot and wore a cord aroundhis robe, tied at the loins. This mode of appearance was later adopted by manyother orders such as the Franciscan monks in Christian times. The MysterySchools were a vehicle to pass on the secret knowledge for positive and negativeintent and for the use of hallucinogenic drugs, sexual rites, and humansacrifice was not unknown either, depending on who controlled them. Mind controltechniques were well understood.Offshoots of the Brotherhood began to emerge, particularly from these Egyptianand Babylonian times. Each had the same secret codes, symbols and initiations.No one in these secret societies is allowed to know what is going on at thelevel above them and this is an extremely effective means of manipulation whichhas been used through the ages. Such organisations continue to this day withnames like the Freemasons, Knights Templar, the Order of the Quest, the Knightsof Malta, the Jesuits, the Round Table and countless others. The Brotherhood isnow at the elite level, under the control of the negative consciousness. Thenames may have changed and the number increased enormously since ancient times,but the agenda remains the same. I am not saying that every member of thesesocieties is knowingly working against the good of humanity. Certainly not. Mostof them will not have a clue about how their society is being used. What I amsaying is that those groups and others are being controlled by people who areseeking to continue and complete the ‘Great Work of Ages’ – the takeover of theplanet and the human mind. How they propose to complete that task we will seelater.One of the most active Brotherhood organisations today are the Freemasons andthey would seem to have their origins in Sumer and Egypt in the guilds of thestonemasons and craftsmen. These guilds copied many of the Brotherhood andmystery school traditions and initiations. The title Grand Master, which iscommon to most secret Brotherhood branches, was already being used at this time.Later, these guilds would evolve into freemasonry which is open to anyoneconsidered acceptable (not just masons) and has been a front for some outrageousbehaviour and manipulation. It aims, like the whole infiltrated Brotherhoodthrough the centuries, to keep spiritual knowledge from the general population(the basis of that set out at the start of this book) and even twist the versionit gives to its initiates. Freemasonry is, today, the major arm of theBrotherhood. Five thousand years after ancient Egypt, Albert Pike, a GrandCommander of the Supreme Council of Freemasonry in America, would describe thissecret society as:“The Custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truthsunknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbrokencurrent of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories.”It is often asked who are ‘they’, the elite that researchers speak of inrelation to the conspiracy to control the human race. How can such an ambitionpossibly have spanned thousands of years? As Pike said, the knowledge and theagenda are handed down through the generations. ‘They’ are people who have beenaccepted into the highest levels of initiation by the infiltrated Brotherhoodsocieties. At any point in history over the last 5,000 years those accepted intothe highest degrees have continued the Great Work, while looking for those withthe potential to take over from them. So while the personnel change, the agendaand methods have remained very much the same. Only those considered certain tocontinue the work and keep it secret are accepted in the elite levels. One waypotential “adepts” have been tested is by telling them to spit on the cross.Those who refuse are congratulated for their commitment to serve God and rejectsuch heresy. But they are never subsequently considered for promotion, becausethey cannot be trusted with the knowledge of the real agenda. Those who do spiton the cross are the ones who go on up the ladder because, among other things,they do as they are told.It is part of the Freemasons’ mythology that human civilisations were begun byvisitors from the star Sirius which they connect with the Egyptian goddess,Isis. Sumerian stories record that these ETs were fish-like in their appearance– the ‘Oannes’ I mentioned before – and that they passed on information aboutbuilding, spiritual symbolism, science and arts. The Egyptians certainlyacknowledged the importance of Sirius to them. The Freemasonic and Brotherhoodsymbol of the pyramid with the capstone depicted as the all-seeing eye goes backto these ancient times. This is said to represent the eye of Sirius – although Isee it as Lucifer. The Dogon people in Mali, in sub-Saharan Africa, have had alegend, probably originating in Egypt, which has been passed on over fivethousand years. It tells of a star that they claimed orbited Sirius. They knewit as the smallest and heaviest of stars containing the germs of all things andthe Dogons said that it weighed so much that ‘all the Earthly beings combinedcannot lift it’. The legend further claims that it took fifty years for the starto orbit Sirius.All this is remarkable when you think that the star they have known about forthousands of years was not officially discovered until the last century and wasphotographed for the first time in 1970. It has been named Sirius B, and theDogons have been proved correct in their claims. For it does take around fiftyyears to complete an orbit and scientists have suggested that one cubic foot ofSirius B matter would weigh 2,000 tons. Obviously, Sirius is of considerablerelevance to what has been happening on this planet. How could Earth people knowsuch details unless they were told by those who knew? Extra-terrestrials orhighly accurate channelling.Freemasonry, like most secret societies of the infiltrated Brotherhood, basesits beliefs and aims on the worship of the Sun God and Mother Goddess mythologywhich it is believed was common to ancient civilisations. This Father/Motherbelief was reflected in the Egyptian trinity of gods – Osiris, the father, Isis,the mother, and Horus, the son. Another name often used for the Brotherhood isits Latin name, the Illuminati, or ‘illuminated ones’. It may sound fantastic atthis stage in our story, but the world is controlled today by a Brotherhood ofsecret societies which go back to this period. The swastika, the lamb, theobelisk, the apron, which some Egyptian gods are depicted as wearing, and, ofcourse, the pyramid and eye are still the symbols of the Brotherhood societies.Thousands of years after ancient Egypt you can find the pyramid and eye symbolvery easily in America. It forms the reverse of the Great Seal of the UnitedStates and appears on every dollar bill. The truths pedalled by the negativesecret societies have been twisted enough to mislead their members. I feel theEgyptian beliefs have been misrespresented to an extent, but, as one researchersaid so correctly, it doesn’t matter if what they believe is true or even if youbelieve it. As long as they believe it, we are all affected by the way theirthinking influences their actions.Channelling was at the centre of the Egyptian culture and could be used tocontrol or, as it was in many cases, to gather knowledge that was not being madeavailable from elsewhere. Just as the Luciferic consciousness wishes to controlpeople, so the consciousness of ‘The Light’ wishes to set them free by allowingthem access to the spiritual truths that are being denied them. Channelling isan important way of doing this. This is one reason why, despite the efforts ofthe manipulators, many people in Babylon and Egypt had more spiritual knowledgethan the elite wanted them to know. Channellers were widely consulted as asource of divine inspiration and there were rooms called the holy of holies orsanctuaries where inter-frequency communications took place. These were built onenergy points where a ‘god’ (a discarnate consciousness in this case) couldcommunicate most effectively. This is how the prophets in the Bible got theirinformation. Those in the Christian Church who equate channelling with devilworship should know that the term prophet comes from the Greek word which meansmedium!In the early Egyptian period, some worshipped the Sun god Ra, and othersfollowed the god Amun or Amen. These two later became fused into one, Amun orAmen Ra. After their prayers and religious teachings they would say the name oftheir god. This was passed on through Judaism into Christianity and, in churchesall over the world today, Christians still end their prayers and readings withthe word ‘Amen’. How many know that, in doing so, they are saying the name of aPagan god of channelled or extra-terrestrial origin, just as the Egyptians did?Amen also represents a sound, by the way, that resonates a certain frequencyknown to the ancients. Egyptian mythology had a trinity of gods in Osiris, thefather, Isis, the mother, and Horus, the son. The Egyptians believed that Osiriscame to suffer so that those who believed in him would live. He was known asLord of Eternity, the Judge and Saviour of the human race, the Resurrection andthe Life, the Bread of Life, the Redeemer and Mediator who would decide theeternal fate of heaven or hell for the dead. Horus was portrayed sitting on hismother’s knee and, from this, the idea of the Madonna and child was to emerge inChristianity. The Egyptian figure of evil, Set, became the Christian version,Satan. The cross was an Egyptian symbol for thousands of years before it wasadopted by Christianity and the Egyptians celebrated the festival of Easter, theday that Horus, the son, was said to have died and risen again to become onewith his father. All this would have been influenced by the Babylonian belief inBel and both would have begun with the same channelled communications orextra-terrestrial influence. In fact, I think that most of this symbolismrelates back to extra-terrestrial activities and the star systems they camefrom, and from the knowledge that the day was approaching when the forces ofdisharmony (Set, Satan, Lucifer etc) would be overcome by harmony. That time isnow.The idea of a trinity of gods, or three gods in one, is a theme that runsthrough countless pre-Christian religions. The Christians merely copied it asthey copied everything else. Some of the symbolism of the trinity is linked toenergy balancing. The three points of the triangle stand forpositive/negative/balance, and male/female/balance. The triangle is a well-knownesoteric symbol as is the double interconnecting triangle known as the Star ofDavid. This represents the balance of the spiritual with the balance of thephysical.Thousands of years before Christianity, dogmatic religious belief, based on themisunderstandings and twisted truths I have highlighted, was already being usedby the Luciferic consciousness in its many guises to close down the potential ofthe human mind and to fill it with myths and the literal interpretation ofsymbolic stories. The fear of the gods and the horrors that would be visitedupon those who did not do as they were told was a very effective way of keepingthe masses from the knowledge of their true selves. The god kings of the variouscultures and the gathering power of the priests as interpreters of the gods’desires added to the expansion of the religious dogma and control.The Egyptian elite were an advanced people for their time in many ways, althoughthey kept most of the population in physical and spiritual slavery. Theyperformed operations – mummies have been found with well-set fractures and falseteeth. It was to be many thousands of years before anything like this appearedin Europe. Educated Egyptians understood the principles of astronomy andastrology, as did the Babylonians. Astronomy and astrology were seen asindivisible sciences. The richer Egyptians lived in beautiful homes with elegantfurniture and artwork. In England, three thousand years later, some Christianclergy were still condemning the use of knives and forks as the work of thedevil.The culture and belief systems developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt, possiblyunder the influence of extra-terrestrials and channelled sources, were to have afundamental impact on all that followed. India was also developing a distinctculture in the pre-Christian world but, again, the basis of the Hindu religionwas inherited from the West when Aryan peoples invaded around 1500BC and turnedthe Indians into their servants. The gods of India, therefore, have a somewhatfamiliar ring. The father god of the Hindus is Brahma and he is part of atrinity of gods which includes Krishna, their version of the Jesus-type figure.Krishna is the Hindu saviour (see Bel, Osiris, etc). He is said to have livedaround 1,000BC and is still revered today in much the same way as Jesus. Thetexts from which Hinduism was created are called the Vedas and in them you canfind references which appear to record extra-terrestrial activities. Hinduismwas a religion introduced by the invaders to create a strict system of hierarchyknown as castes. It was a means to divide and rule. The religious apartheidwhich Hinduism promotes with its castes, taboos and impositions is a continuingconfirmation, as with most religion, that large areas of incarnate humanity areyet to evolve from spiritual childhood. But, if you want a system of control,it’s wonderful and it is being used in that way today just as it was by theAryans. Missionaries from the Egyptian Brotherhood also arrived in India duringand after the invasion and, as a consequence, its power began to expand rapidly.India is, today, a major centre of Brotherhood activity.Five hundred years after the physical life claimed for Krishna came GautamaBuddha which translates as Gautama the Enlightened. Today he is known simply asBuddha and, in his name, the religion of Buddhism has flourished. Buddha wasborn in India into a royal family. He was a prince, but he gave up thisprivilege and wealth to spread his philosophy which incorporated reincarnationand an ethical way of life based on peace and love. I don’t agree with all thathe believed in but there is much that I can easily support. He spoke out againstthe priests of the day and encouraged the pursuit of truth, wisdom andknowledge. He talked of a universal brotherhood (the positive variety!) andequal rights for men and women. Buddha spoke simple truths. He had no desire tobe turned into some saviour-god or to be worshipped by followers who complicatedhis simple philosophy with additions, ceremonies and hierarchies. All he stoodfor – and all we ever really need – is spiritual knowledge, not endless ‘isms’to complicate them.After Buddha’s physical release, his beliefs became the dominant religion inIndia. In the third century, King Asoka would adopt Buddhism and send hisrepresentatives across the known world to promote its philosophy. They travelledas far as Alexandria in Egypt where it became diluted somewhat by the Egyptianidea of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The depiction of Horus in the arms of hismother, Isis, became Buddha in the arms of the goddess, Hatari. Buddhism wasreplaced by Brahmanism as the major religion in India, but it was accepted byother Eastern countries and has made significant inroads into other parts of theworld. Buddha’s contribution to the raising of planetary consciousness was verysuccessful. He is a wonderful example of how the volunteer consciousness seeksto work, with simple truths and no imposition. Hinduism was to become the statereligion in India as the centuries passed and it was to do for Indian evolutionwhat Christianity did in the West. It held back their mental and spiritualdevelopment for thousands of years.Confucius was another volunteer incarnation. He was born in about 551BC inChina. His real name was K’ung Fu-tze which meant Master K’ung but this becameLatinised into Confucius. He worked as a schoolmaster and stressed ethicalconduct and the importance of setting an example through one’s own behaviour. Hewas later a brilliant magistrate and Minister of Crime who argued vigorously forsocial reform. But, like many of his kind, his wisdom was acknowledged less inhis lifetime than after his physical death. He died a disappointed man,believing he had failed to bring about the change of attitude he had hoped for.However, with his going he became a national hero and his words have beenconstantly quoted ever since. Sometimes, when we leave this level we can releasean energy which can affect people long afterwards and those who tune to thisenergy field will begin to focus on what that person has done and said. OneConfucian saying was, “What you do not like when done to yourself do not do toothers”. This theme of ‘do to others what you would have them do to you’ iscommon to many religions and philosophies. Many claim it for themselves when itis really an eternal truth. If we all observed it in our everyday lives, what adifferent world it would be. In China, during the life of Confucius, there wasanother being of great evolution called Lao-tsze, from whom we get Taoism. Hisviews were similar to those of Buddha but they, too, were complicated anddevalued in the usual way by those who followed the ‘ism’ created in his name.The Chinese led the world in their greatest periods with their knowledge andcreativity. They identified the energy grid of the Earth which they calledDragon Lines and they introduced a form of healing called acupuncture whichbalanced the flows in the energy grid of the human body. They also discoveredthe opposing forces which need to be kept in balance and called them the yin andthe yang.Buddha, Confucius, Lao-tsze, Jesus: the list goes on. All these, and others likethem, are aspects of consciousness who came into incarnation to bring to thisfrequency simple messages from higher frequencies in order to raise and awakenhuman consciousness from the bondage of religion, myth and ignorance. As superbpsychic channellers who could access information and understanding from veryhigh sources, they also channelled energies of immense power to the planet. Inmost cases, their later followers have turned them into saviour figures orpeople to be worshipped as mystical heroes. This has often polluted theirphilosophy on life into dogmas and creeds. They have also attributed to themsayings and experiences that either never happened or derived from myths, eventsand people of an earlier time or different location. It is the last thing theywanted or believed in when they walked this Earth, I feel.Before we leave the pre-Christian story in Europe and the East, we need to lookat two other civilisations which have had a profound impact on human evolution,the Greeks and the Romans. Around the Aegean Sea, thousands of years beforeChristianity, there were incarnations of the volunteer consciousness. Someinfluenced people in the area where Athens was later built and helped to startthe Mycenaean civilisation. Others incarnated on the island of Crete and becameknown as the Minoans. At Knossos on Crete you can still see the ruins of amagnificent palace called the Labyrinth. Without knowing its historicalbackground, I went to Crete on holiday. When we visited Knossos I was guided bymy intuition to bury in the ruins of the palace a large crystal I had been givenin Glastonbury. The palace was clearly built on a strong earth energy point, aswere most ancient palaces and temples. The ancients had a greater understandingof the nature of earth energies than those who came after them in the Christianera. Again, when I talk of volunteer incarnations, I don’t mean that they werethe whole civilisation, only certain members of it. Sometimes they were listenedto, sometimes ignored or even killed. The Mycenaeans worshipped a trinity ofgods and their religious symbol was the cross. They were conquered by tribes ofAryan peoples who took control of the land we call Greece. They worshipped a godcalled Zeus. The Ancient Greeks (also known as the Hellenes) were not a nationas such in these early days. They were a series of independent tribes and wereonly formed together into a nation when Philip of Macedonia took control in the4th century BC. By then they had founded the original Olympics.The Greeks at this time did not have a state religion. People were allowed toworship whichever gods they felt right were right for them and they wouldconsult the hundreds of ‘Oracles’ (channellers) who were available in thetemples and shrines for guidance. Again, we see this misunderstanding betweendiscarnate communicators and ‘gods’ which has caused so much confusion. The word‘angel’ comes from the Greek angelos, meaning messenger. Angels were believed tobe divine messengers. This pagan belief was encompassed into Christian doctrine.The Greeks produced some outstanding examples of the volunteer consciousness. Inthe 6th century BC, Xenophanes was suggesting that God was not a man but a mindwhich orders the Universe and is beyond human understanding. He said there was aunity of all things and ‘the all is one and the one is God’. Xenophaneschallenged the belief that a god came to Earth and suffered so that our sinscould be forgiven. As we have seen, this came from Bel, perhaps even earlier,and the sacrifice of the lamb. But, later, along would come Christianity tocarry on that myth for another 2,000 years. The great Greek thinkers, who wereunfortunately only in the minority, realised that the Universe is governed bymathematical law and consciousness of high evolution, and not by mythical gods.The period 600 to 300BC saw Greece at the height of its intellectual powers.Pythagoras and Thales travelled to Egypt to absorb its knowledge which theywould use together with their own inspiration and research to become the firstGreek scientists. Science comes from a Latin word meaning knowledge. Thales wasthe founder of Greek geometry, astronomy and philosophy while Pythagoras was asuperb mathematician who said, as did Philolaus, that the earth revolved aroundthe Sun. This was two thousand years before it became accepted wisdom.Pythagoras was a social and religious reformer who stood for truth and ethics inall things. He was a vegetarian by ethical choice. Healing was another aspect ofGreek life which evolved rapidly in this period and Hippocrates became known asthe Father of Medicine. Doctors still take the Hippocratic oath. He refused toaccept the idea, prevalent until then, that illness was caused by sin or devils.Surgery developed, too, in Greece but Christianity would put an end to all thatfor around 1700 years because they believed in the resurrection of the physicalbody. They did not want mutilated bodies being resurrected and, as Christianpower grew, Greek and Roman hospitals and healing centres would be destroyed andtheir doctors killed or banished. The Greeks were the first people sinceAtlantis to make geography a science. They produced the first historians, theyinvestigated the laws of physics and discovered the law of cause and effect.Democritus suggested that matter was made up of atoms two thousand four hundredyears before modern science. Greece produced outstanding playwrights, artistsand orators and created laws and forms of democratic government which have beenthe foundations of what we see today. The word democracy comes from Greece.The three greatest philosophers of this time were Socrates, Plato, andAristotle. They did not know everything or get everything right, and they wereinfluenced to an extent by the culture around them. But here were three aspectsof the volunteer consciousness who were, in so much of their understanding,thousands of years in advance of their time. Socrates was a medium whocommunicated with other levels and pursued truth, knowledge and understandingwith unwavering determination. He talked in the market places and on streetcorners, propounding his views and questioning people in order to gain moreknowledge. He said that a revolution of thought was the only way to a revolutionof behaviour. Socrates was the first since Atlantis to explain scientificallythe mystery of life. He taught that around the Earth were ‘many mansions for thesoul’. How close this is to the ‘many mansions in my Father’s house’ in theBible. He also said that those we contacted in these ‘many mansions’ were notsupernatural gods but discarnate beings like us. Socrates was not popular withthe priests who still had power despite the undermining of their credibility bythese outstanding men. While they were tuning to extremely high levels ofconsciousness, the mass of the people were still influenced by ignorant priests.Socrates was accused of corrupting the young by propounding heretical ideas andwas sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. This he did with great calmness andconfidence, because he knew where he was going and he knew it was better thanwhere he was. When asked by his friend, Crito, how he wished to be buried,Socrates replied, “Wherever you will, if only you can catch me. Is it notstrange that, after all I have said to convince you that I am going to thesociety of the happy, you still think this body to be Socrates? To die and bereleased is better for me.”The execution of Socrates for speaking his mind was a rare happening in Athens,and it came during a period when the ideals of freedom of speech weretemporarily forgotten. Normally, Athens, with its liberal attitude, provided agreat contrast to other areas of the world where one could be murdered for themildest questioning of those in power. Socrates had been allowed to speak freelyuntil then. Indeed, freedom of speech, religion and politics were generally anaccepted part of life except for the odd period when those ideals lapsed.Socrates must have said the wrong thing at the wrong time from the point of viewof the authorities because his pupil, Plato, was later allowed to continue tospeak in the same vein without losing his life. Plato was devastated by hisfriend’s death and left Greece to visit Egypt, Palestine, Italy and Sicily. Helearned from the people and cultures he encountered while outlining his beliefsin virtue and justice wherever he went. Plato was a man of courage and spoke outagainst tyranny. He saw it as cowardice which, of course, it is. The King ofSicily was so outraged by this that he had Plato arrested and sold into slavery.Fortunately, he was bought by a supporter who gave him back his freedom. Whenyou are here for the good of the planet and humanity, the other levels arealways trying to protect you in times of danger. They work through others whoare in close enough contact with their higher selves to be used as a means ofcommunicating through their thoughts. In this case, Plato was bought by asupporter and not by someone who might have prevented all the wonderful work hehad yet to do.Plato returned to Athens and founded a school of philosophy which was called theAcademy. It was named after the garden in which it was built and, today, westill use the word academy for an educational institution. Those with open mindsflocked to hear the Plato wisdom. Pupils were encouraged to think, question andlook at everything with open, inquiring minds. Every opinion was welcomed. Hesaid that things were not always what they appeared at first to be. Two thousandthree hundred years ago he said the mind was the eternal part of us which couldexist outside the physical body. Even today, our so called state-of-the-artscience still hasn’t realised that the eternal mind and the brain are not thesame and that consciousness can exist outside the body. Indeed, that is itsusual state. Plato, incidentally, was apparently involved in the Greek mysteryschool of the time. I don’t know if this was a positive or negative influence onhim. I certainly disagree with some of his views on life, but his understandingof creation was well ahead of today’s ‘science’.Just as Socrates taught Plato, so Plato taught Aristotle. Aristotle could havebeen a reincarnation of the Socrates consciousness. Socrates helped Plato toawaken to his true self and, through reincarnation, Plato may have done the samefor him later when he became the personality called Aristotle. You can see howreincarnation can allow a relatively few aspects of consciousness to have anongoing effect on human thinking. When one of their physical lives ends, anotherbegins, and the work continues in another body. I think the Lucifericconsciousness works in exactly the same way. Aristotle was a genius of his time.He was well versed in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, astronomy,botany, anatomy and psychology and was always searching for furtherunderstanding in all these subjects and more. Like Plato, he started a school.It was known as the Lyceum. He also inspired the foundation of the famousuniversity at Alexandria where people could research and lecture without thediversions of the mythical gods promoted by the religions.The intellectual greatness of Athens withered during the Peloponnesian War whenthe Spartans and Corinthians combined with others to defeat the Athenians. Thewar lasted twenty-seven years and the pre-eminence of Athens was over. Within afew centuries of it being Christianised, the Church would burn all the writingsof Plato, Aristotle and other Greek knowledge that came to light. They saw thishuman enlightenment as heresy against the Bible. But some of their work survivedand would rise again to public attention after the Renaissance in Europe.The incarnations of the volunteer consciousness that propelled Athens into thecentre of intellectual thought was extremely successful in raising understandingand would continue to affect the thinking of millions over the centuries. Butthe power of the Luciferic consciousness to control the minds of so many shouldnot be underestimated. Its most important weapons are conflict, imposition andignorance, and it would have been very determined to put an end to what washappening in Athens. The Lucifer-controlled human beings in the negative secretsocieties and elsewhere, always seek to stimulate conflict. The cause doesn’tmatter as long as it happens. The wars that destroyed intellectual Athens andthe pursuit of further knowledge would be repeated across the globe and over thegenerations, as the struggle between harmony and disharmony increased in itsintensity.Greek philosophy would influence the Romans. Around 1000BC some nomadic tribessettled alongside the River Tiber in what is now Italy. They called theirsettlement Latium, hence Latin. This language was the fusion of the Aryan tongueand the Celtic. It evolved through the interaction and inter-marriage of theAryan speakers and the darker-skinned Iberian Celts. By 753BC, a trading centrehad been established near to seven hills and was named Roma. From this beginningwas to come a vast empire which, at its peak, would encompass Spain, France(Gaul), Italy, Dalmatia, Macedonia, Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Libya,Numidia, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, Egypt and most of Britain andMesopotamia. This was achieved largely through violence and slaughter.The early Romans were governed by kings. They had a flirtation with a republic,though it could hardly be described as a democracy. The priests with their mumbojumbo still held sway. There was a people’s forum, a sort of popular assemblycalled the Comita Tributa, but, any time the priests said the gods did not wishit to take place, it had to be cancelled. The priests determined the wishes ofthe gods by examining the hearts and livers of sacrificed animals. They believedthat the heart and liver were the seat of the mind and that, through them, thegods could speak to them. The chaotic republic was replaced by a series ofEmperors. This began after the emergence of the most famous Roman of them all,Julius Caesar, who was born in 100BC. He was a military leader who fought,conquered, and terrorised most of Europe. For, despite all his gifts as anorator and general, he was a tyrant and a butcher. He had many enemies in Romewho feared and resented his growing power. Eventually, he invaded his owncountry. He crossed a stream called the Rubicon which marked the border betweenhis province and the rest of Italy. He took control of Rome and her empire and,in time, gave himself the title Pontifex Maximus as head of the state religion.This title of the head of what was a pagan religion is now held by the Pope!Julius Caesar was seen by most of his subjects as a divine being, yet anothergod king. Caesar travelled to Egypt where he fell for the charms of Cleopatrawhom he would later take to Rome. But, in 44BC, he was murdered on the Ides(15th) of March by those who hated him for the power he had over them and theEmpire.There followed a long series of emperors, most of them less than wise andcompassionate, but there were many good things about the Roman civilisation,too. Nothing is all good or all bad. Under the rule of Vespasian in the nineyears from 70AD a system of education was introduced which was influenced by theideas and beliefs of Plato and Aristotle. He made his minister of education aSpaniard turned Roman citizen called Quintilian who much admired the Greekphilosophers. He organised an elaborate system of schools in the Roman Empirewhich taught the virtues of liberty, justice and truth, while abhorring crueltyand oppression. If only they and their like in Greece had been allowed toflourish and grow, what a different world we would live in today. Instead,Christianity was to cast its darkness across the Roman Empire and beyond. Theschools were closed and their teachers scattered or killed because the pursuitof knowledge outside the pages of the Bible was seen as heresy. The greatlibrary at Alexandria was turned into a theological college and darkness anddelusion descended on the collective mind of the human race.So, in our story, we have been through two distinct phases of human history.There were the times when extra-terrestrials populated the planet. Then, afterthe end of Atlantis, fewer of them came here but they still visited, and wereseen by the people as gods. Channelling and psychic communications became themeans through which the ‘gods’ most influenced us. ETs working for the Light –the great majority – and the Light Consciousness, have, in general, been workingthrough the volunteers and any humans who wish to hear their message of love andspiritual freedom. But the Light will not interfere in human free will while theLuciferic stream has no such ethics. It has used whatever means necessary tocreate conflict, confusion and ignorance.All three of which bring to mind what has been one of Lucifer’s most effectivevehicles for suppressing knowledge, understanding and mental liberation. It washis invention and it has served his cause so wonderfully well. Only today,nearly two thousand years later, are we beginning to cast off the yoke it hasimposed on human evolution. It is the tragedy we call Christianity."},{"pageContent":"4Bible StoriesTHE story of the Jews is woven through the early Middle Eastern cultures.About eighteen centuries before Christianity some event caused the Euphrates tochange its course and bypass the Sumer city of Ur. No more could the land aroundthe city be irrigated by an extensive system of ditches, nor could their shipsreach the sea to trade. The inhabitants moved inland to settle alongside theriver at Babylon. Abraham of the Old Testament left the city of Ur with hisfamily and slaves. Among them was his nephew, Lot. According to Hebrewscriptures they settled in Syria (an abbreviation of Assyria) which they calledCanaan. This name was later given to the whole area west of the Jordan,including what became Palestine. They led a nomadic life with their animals and,at one time, travelled to Egypt in search of food during a famine. Abraham wasmuch impressed by what he saw in Egypt and took this knowledge of their beliefsand customs back to Canaan. He became a wealthy and influential man and used hishundreds of armed slaves to support various factions in the wars betweenCanaanite communities.Abraham fathered two children late in his life by two women, Hagar and Sarai,and they were named Ishmael and Isaac. It is quite possible, given his advancedage, that they were fathered by a younger man or men. It was now that Abrahamintroduced circumcision which he had seen used in Egypt. Abraham’s idea was tocreate a distinction between the followers of his God and the other peoples ofCanaan. They worshipped the Sumerian god, En-lil, which became known as Allah orEl. It was originally a Sun god, though almost certainly with extra-terrestrialorigins, and they would have thought they were communicating with this beingthrough their channellings. With the death of Abraham, his son Isaac became headof the family and he had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. The family and its offshootswere still nomads, but rich ones by the standards of the time. Jacob, the storygoes, fathered twelve sons and the one he called Joseph was sold by jealousbrothers to travelling merchants in the desert. Joseph was taken by them toEgypt where he was sold into slavery, but later he would become a favourite ofthe Pharaoh. This may sound far-fetched at first, but Egypt was then ruled byBedouin invaders, the Hyksos or ‘Shepherd Kings’. They were the same race asJoseph, the Arab nomad, and they had a similar culture. Joseph was made primeminister and put in charge of food production in Egypt. When ten of his brotherswere driven to Egypt by famine they were reunited. Jacob was known as Israel,which means ‘El (God) does battle’ and his family and descendants would becalled Israelites.The twelve sons of Jacob grew into twelve tribes. The so-called House of Joseph,the slave-turned-prime minister, took a different course to the others. TheIsraelites settled in an area called Goshen on the Eastern side of Lower Egypt,and over the next four hundred years or so they became a nation. All was wellfor them while the Shepherd Kings reigned in Egypt but, when they were removedby rebellion, life became tough for the Israelites. They were disarmed and putto work as slaves. The Egyptians decreed that all male children of theIsraelites should be killed and the intention was that soon the Israelite nationwould cease to exist.Around the thirteenth century BC the man known as Moses was born and, it issaid, was brought up by a Pharaoh’s daughter after he was found floating in abasket in the bulrushes. The story goes that he killed an Egyptian for badlytreating an Israelite and fled into the desert of Sinai. There he learned moreof Allah, the God of Abraham, and he had what appeared to be profound psychicexperiences and communications. To him this had to be God and not just adiscarnate entity. Either that or he was contacted by extra-terrestrials orsubjected to some sort of mind-suggestion. Some of the descriptions in the Bibleof this god of Moses could certainly be spacecraft of some kind. It is worthpointing out, too, that ET technology can project three-dimensional images wecall holograms which appear to be ‘visions’. The craft need not be seen whenthis is happening and ‘miracles’ like a burning bush would be easy for ETs tomanifest. Anyway, whatever it was that happened to Moses, his experiences ledhim to reject the Egyptian trinity of gods, Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and turn toAllah or El, the ‘One God’. Interestingly, Moses would surely have attended theBrotherhood Mystery School in Egypt given his royal connections and they werepromoting the idea of one God at least from the time of Akhenaton. It has beenstressed to me in channelling that we should not underestimate the knowledge ofhypnosis and mind-controlling drugs available in the mystery schools at thistime.On the death of the Pharaoh, Moses returned to Egypt where he told theIsraelites that Allah had appeared to him in the desert. The god had said theywere his chosen people. He said further that Allah wished to be known by theIsraelites as Yhvh, which was pronounced ‘Yaweh’ and later became Jehovah. Thismeans ‘Rain Cloud’. From now on all the Israelite channellers were thought to bevehicles for the god Jehovah and the promises made to them through these sourceswere believed to be the promises of their god.It was the same with other peoples the world over and this is how many god-mythsoriginated. As Luke’s Gospel says: “He [God] spake from the mouth of his holyprophets (channellers) which have been since the world began.” When you look atthe communications Moses was supposed to have had with Jehovah on Mount Sinaiyou can relate it to the communications on Mount Olympus which the Greeksclaimed to have had with their god, Zeus. The same themes run through all ofthem.Moses told the new Pharaoh of his communications and asked for permission tolead the Israelites out of Egypt to the land of Abraham in Canaan, the ‘promisedland’ which ‘God’ had told him about. The Pharaoh eventually agreed and thegreat exodus began. They took with them the mummy of Joseph and walked acrossthe Red Sea by a sand bar which Napoleon I was also later to use. On thejourney, it is said, Moses was given by ‘God’ the laws of his tribe which areknown as the Ten Commandments with all those ‘Thou shalt nots’ and such like.Perhaps he channelled them or maybe he just thought he was channelling thembecause similar laws could be found in other areas of the Middle East. Maybe hemet with the occupants of a spacecraft. As the biblical description says:“On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloudappeared on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet was heard. [Jehovah oftenarrived with the sound of trumpets.] All the people in the camp trembled withfear.“Moses led them out of the camp to meet God and they stood at the foot of themountain. The whole of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord hadcome down on it in fire. The smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and allthe people trembled violently.”Exodus 19: vv 16-18.Imagine what it would be like for that ancient people, or even people today, tosee a spacecraft land on a mountain top and you can appreciate what might havebeen happening on Mount Sinai. The fierce, harsh, and bloodthirsty God of theOld Testament would fit with the theme of extremely negative extra-terrestrialswho sought to control people on Earth through fear and imposition. Exodus goeson:“When the people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast and saw the lightningand the smoking mountain, they trembled with fear and stood a long way off. Theysaid to Moses, ‘If you speak to us, we will listen; but we are afraid that ifGod speaks to us, we will die’.“Moses replied, ‘Don’t be afraid; God has come only to test (frighten) you andmake you keep on obeying him, so that you will not sin’. But the peoplecontinued to stand a long way off, and only Moses went near the dark cloud whereGod was.”Exodus 20: vv 18-20This constant mention of a cloud in relation to Jehovah’s appearances isinteresting, given also that his name means ‘rain cloud’. Producing clouds isnot a problem for ET technology. Indeed the elite Brotherhood scientists oftoday have the technology to manipulate the weather, at least in a small area. Ihave no doubt that some event happened on Sinai, but I am not convinced thatMoses was given all the Thou Shalt Nots at that time. It is most likely that thewhole story of the commandments is a myth and the laws of the Israelites did notcome through Moses on the mountain at all. There are many similar stories sharedby different civilisations and each claims them as their own when all they havedone is change the names involved. The religious dogma and ceremonies of theIsraelites were naturally influenced by the Egyptians as you would expect giventhat they had all been brought up in that country. The clothing of their priestswas inspired by Egypt. Incidentally, during the journey, the Israelites hadperiods of hunger and thirst, obviously, as they walked through the desertlands. According to the stories they were helped by manna from Heaven. I haveseen this portrayed as bread falling from the sky. In fact, manna is a stickysubstance produced by a desert shrub.It became obvious when they reached the ‘Promised Land’ of Canaan that thecommunications to Moses from whatever source had left something to be desired.Either that or his communicator was giving him some inaccurate information forsome reason. They found well-armed peoples in walled cities who resisted theiradvance. Moses had led them to believe that the promised land was unoccupied andwaiting only for them. He was less than popular and the Israelites wandered inthe desert for another forty years before they became fierce and barbaricwarriors. Moses passed on and Joshua, a man of war, took over from him. Theopposition in the promised land was still too much for them, but under theleadership of Joshua they ejected the Arab shepherd peoples from a large area.This was to be called Palestine and here they settled down as an agriculturalpeople with each tribe ruled by a sheik. They were still very primitive. Theyhad only stone implements and they made animal sacrifices to Jehovah who wasstill being channelled, followed, and often seen in ways that could suggest ETinvolvement. Jehovah was always demanding animal sacrifices and he, or they,were clearly a deeply unpleasant piece of work under the control of theLuciferic consciousness. To be circumcised by a sharp stone doesn’t bearthinking about, but that’s what happened. It was barbaric.There were occasions when some Israelites would turn away from the instructionsof Jehovah and worship Baal – Bel, the Son of God of Mesopotamia. As time passedthe attributes given to Jehovah and Baal began to merge. Around 1150BC, theprophet (channeller) Samuel came on the scene. The Israelites were nowcontrolled by the Philistines and Samuel inspired a desire for liberty. Saulbecame king, against Samuel’s wishes, and he also took over his post of highpriest. Saul turned his tribe of Judah into the dominant force of theIsraelites, defeating the Philistines and securing independence. Saul had agreat rival in David and to escape Saul’s wrath David went into the desert ofJudea and lived the life of a criminal, murderer, and outlaw. Men, women andchildren were massacred by David and his band. Many were dismembered or burntalive. He always consulted Jehovah before setting out to steal and kill andalways received permission. You can see how any amount of slaughter can bejustified in the name of a god when you are either channelling a low vibrationalentity or deluding yourself with your own thoughts. Such is the story ofreligion.David became king when he and his bandits joined forces with the Philistines andconquered Judea. He then turned on and defeated the Philistines, takingJerusalem in the process. It is from the word Philistine that Palestine cameafter this victory. David’s armies were merciless, often burning anddismembering their victims. His aggression and lust for power fuelled theexpansion of his empire into Canaan, the rest of Syria, and Northern Arabia. Heand the Israelites now controlled a region from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. Sothe Israelite Empire was born under the control of the House of Judah. We arenow in the period up to 1015BC. As Arthur Findlay points out in his outstandingwork, The Curse of Ignorance, people were still being fined and jailed inBritain up to the last century for daring to criticise David and other OldTestament heroes who were believed to be vehicles for the righteousness of God.After David came his son Solomon, the man of ‘wisdom’ according to legend. Infact, he had no more respect for human life than had David. He killed hisbrother, the rightful heir under their laws, to become king in the first place.Solomon became an important member of the Brotherhood after he became an advisorto the Pharaoh, Shishak I, and married his daughter. While in Egypt he wasinitiated into the Brotherhood at El Amarna and when he returned to Jerusalem hebuilt the famous temple to Jehovah which has been fought over ever since. It wasa Brotherhood temple and, according to freemasons’ legend, Solomon invited theBrotherhood craft guilds of Egypt, the forerunners of the freemasons, to helpwith its construction. Many freemasons are led to believe that theirorganisation began with the building of Solomon’s temple and this has added tothe myth that freemasonry is connected with the Bible, the Holy Land, and is inservice to the ‘Great Architect of the Universe’ – God. In fact the Brotherhoodgoes back well beyond the time of Solomon and, in the case of its elite, itanswers to a very different master. As Albert Pike, the Grand Commander of theSupreme Council of Freemasons in America would say in the 1870s:“The Masonic Religion should be by all of us initiates in the High Degreesmaintained in the purity of the Luciferic doctrine.”They don’t tell the lower initiates that, however, until they have agreed tosubmit themselves with a binding oath to the authority of their worshipfulmaster who, according to the Mackey Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, must be obeyedas a first duty of every freemason.The secret Brotherhood of Babylonia and Egypt was expanding rapidly as was itsnegative infiltration. It had already spread across other parts of the MiddleEast and one of its best known promoters was the Canaanite God-King,Melchizedek. His priesthood wore the famous Brotherhood symbol of the apron, andcombined it with another Brotherhood symbol, the lamb, by making their apronsout of lamb skin. The freemasons still do this. The Brotherhood is alsoextremely strong and active in Israel and the Jewish culture in general todaywith its mystical expression, the kabbalah, also reflecting the classicprinciples of Brotherhood societies. That is not to say that the Kabbalah isnegative. It is merely esoteric knowledge which can be used for good or ill. TheKabbalah is another expression of the spiritual knowledge which goes back toAtlantis and beyond and from which all religions have come. The Order ofMelchizadek is kabbalistic and promotes the philosophy of a world governmentwhich is the aim of the negative Brotherhood movement.Solomon’s temple was nothing more than a slaughterhouse with a stream of animalsbeing sacrificed daily to gratify the perceived desires of Jehovah. A highpriest and an army of 30,000 ‘lesser’ priests were supported by thecontributions of the people to carry out this butchery. Their job had nothing todo with spirituality. They were nothing more than slaughterhouse workers. Thepriests, who were now taking over in their religion from the mediums andchannellers as the accepted source of Jehovah’s will, announced that their godpreferred the sacrifice of animals rather than crops and vegetation. The crops,you see, had to be burned as part of the sacrifice, but the animals only had tobe killed and the priests then had the right to eat or sell the carcass. Thissame mentality was still alive in the 17th century when the first lighthouse wasplanned. Trinity House had been set up by Henry VIII for the Trinity Brethren,and their duty was to pray for the souls of people lost at sea. In return theywere given the rights to everything salvaged from the ships wrecked on theEnglish coast. When the Eddystone Lighthouse was proposed, Trinity House opposedit because they could see that fewer wrecks meant less salvage for them.Under Solomon, Egyptian and Phoenician beliefs became absorbed into theIsraelite worship of Jehovah and truths, half truths, myths, and lies werebecoming merged as the centuries passed. When he died, the Judean empirecollapsed and the other tribes of Israel revolted. Two distinct groups emerged,the Israelites in the north including Samaria and Galilee and those in SouthernJudea who were called the Jews. The worship of Baal re-emerged to challenge thatof Jehovah, but the prophets Elijah and, more successfully, Elisha, made surethe worship of Baal was destroyed and Jehovah ruled supreme. Women were treatedappallingly. They were bought and sold and, when their husbands died they becamepart of his estate just like his cattle and land. Incest was common and childrenwere sold, ill treated, and sacrificed; slavery abounded.The people of Israel believed they were God’s chosen people who would inheritthe Earth, but a shepherd called Amos announced that he had communicated withJehovah (the Lord) and he said their kingdom was to be taken from them. Evenworse, Jehovah would lead the aggressors because the ‘chosen people’ had defiedhis instructions. Amos was right in that civil war broke out in 745BC and theAssyrians took advantage to conquer the lands of Israel. The ten northern tribesbegan to disintegrate, a process the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks and Romanswould complete. Amos, Hosea and other prophets steered the people away from thebelief in a nationalistic god and weakened the power of the priests. Theypreferred to promote a gentler God of mercy and justice who spoke for allpeople, not only the Israelites.The Assyrians invaded Samaria and later Judea which was by then being guided bythe prophet, Isaiah. He proved to be a man of some wisdom and foresight and wasobviously channelling a higher level of consciousness than some of the others.But on his death the old view of Jehovah returned with the human and animalsacrifices and the power of the priests. Other prophets like Jeremiah warned ofthe consequences. He predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple(slaughterhouse) built by Solomon. Jeremiah’s predictions were vindicated whenthe Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar attacked and defeated the people of Judea,the Jews. By 586BC Judah was no more and Jerusalem was in ruins. The Jews weredispersed across Chaldea as had already happened to the Israelites. Theyabsorbed the customs and beliefs of the Mesopotamian peoples and many movedtheir devotion from Jehovah to Bel. The exiles inherited the Chaldean idea ofrest on the seventh day, the Sabatu, and on their return the tradition wouldbegin of attending churches or Synagogues to hear the writings of the prophets.When they were freed by the Persians, as noted earlier, they took theMesopotamian customs and beliefs back to Samaria and Judea along with some ofthe holy relics, including golden candlesticks which Nebuchadnezzar had takenfrom them.They now expected the Messiah to appear and lead them to their true destiny,although many Jews stayed in Babylon and other areas and did not choose toreturn to the promised land. Incidentally, Jewish people trace their ancestryback to Abraham and the times we are discussing, but today the Jewish majorityare Ashkenazim Jews, who, Arthur Koestler claims, originated from a Turkishtribe who converted in the 8th century as an alternative to being forced toespouse Islam or Christianity (see The Thirteenth Tribe). The Sephardic Jews, onthe other-hand, who genetically originate from Biblical Jews, are today in theminority. The idea of a Messiah came from the Persians and from either there orEgypt they absorbed the belief in the resurrection of the physical body and thatof a million years of righteousness. Palestine was ruled by the Persians, butthe Jews were allowed to re-build the temple in Jerusalem and have their ownreligious hierarchy controlled by the Jewish people. The influence of Babylon onJewish thought and belief continued to grow. Under the guidance of two mencalled Ezra and Nehemiah the Jewish society became a little more civilised. Bothwere greatly influenced by their time in Babylon where they heard the Chaldeanstories of the Tower of Babel (Babylon), the Great Flood, and Noah. Ezrare-wrote the Book of the Law which had been destroyed when the temple wasransacked and the laws he says were given to Moses were no more than the beliefsEzra picked up in Babylon like the Sabbath (Sabatu) and the idea that theCreator rested on the seventh day.Jewish influence grew across the Middle East and they expanded their numbersinto many areas. The Greeks gave them the name Hebrews which means the ‘peoplefrom the other side’ (of the Mediterranean.) Some of the Jewish texts weretranslated into Greek. The Jews became traders, valuers, moneylenders andpawnbrokers, buying and selling primarily rather than producing. Alexander theGreat, a man similar in attitude to King David, took over the Macedonian empirefrom his father and conquered Egypt and the land we know as Palestine. On thedeath of Alexander one of his generals, Ptolemy I, took over Jerusalem. Thiswasn’t difficult because he attacked on the Sabbath and the Jews refused tofight on their holy day. The Greek influence on the people of Jerusalemincreased and a dispute developed between the Hellenised (Greek influenced) Jewsand those who wished to retain the old ways of Jehovah. Conflict erupted and inwalked the King of Syria, Antiochus IV, to assume power in Jerusalem. Howironic, as we chronicle this constant bloodshed, that Jerusalem translates as‘City of Peace’. Antiochus tried to force the pagan customs of Greece onto thebelievers in Jehovah and insisted they worship a god called Jove. A bloodbathensued as the supporters of Jehovah resisted.The theme of constant conflict will be seen throughout human history. TheLuciferic consciousness and the human expressions of that consciousness do notcare what causes the conflict. A sense of religious or racial superiority,greed, a lust for power, anything will do. They will support a nation when itsuits them and cause it to be destroyed when it doesn’t. All they want is fornegative energy to be produced in abundance to serve the master, Lucifer, andfor humanity to remain so divided and awash with fear and the pressure ofeveryday life that they won’t open their minds for long enough to see who theyare and what is really going on. I am not going to keep labouring this pointthrough the rest of our brief history of humankind, except where I feel it needsto be highlighted. But keep in mind through all that follows how conflict anddivision are the aims of the disharmonious consciousness and anything thatcauses that serves its purpose. Often this will be stimulated by a direct attackon human minds by the Luciferic consciousness which manipulates the negativehuman emotions of ego, greed, and a wish for power. You don’t have to affectmany people to start a war, given that for most of human history the decision ofone king, queen, or dictator can decide the fate of millions who have no desireto fight. And you only have to affect the thinking of one side because, oncethey attack, the other side has to defend itself and war has begun. You canstart a war by affecting the mind of one person and if he or she happens to bean incarnation of the Luciferic consciousness it’s child’s play. The negativesecret societies of the Brotherhood in their many forms have had an importantrole in the artificial creation of conflict by pulling the strings behind thescenes and whenever possible getting its members and followers into positions ofpower. Because it has so many levels of initiation, one level can manipulate thelower levels who have no idea of the agenda being followed by their ‘superiors’.This very much applies to politicians today. In this way, people can help tostart a conflict when they have no wish to do so. Say a brotherhood member istold of a plan by Nation A to attack Nation B or to undermine it in some way.That member might be persuaded to warn the leaders of Nation B of what was goingon. The member would do this out of the best of intentions. But he wouldn’t knowthat another member from a different branch of the Brotherhood was tellingNation A exactly the same about Nation B. Those Brotherhood members wouldbelieve they were doing the right thing, but wouldn’t know that they were beingused to start a conflict that would not have started otherwise. Once you haveorganisations based on secrecy and levels of initiation that the lower rungsknow nothing about, very few people can control the rest, most of whom might belovely human beings who do not wish harm to anyone. So it is with theBrotherhood. It may sound simplistic and these things are often more complex,but the basic themes of manipulation, agents provocateurs, and secretBrotherhood assassinations calculated to stir up conflict have been behind muchof the horror that has plagued the human story.The invaders of Jerusalem were eventually removed, but internal strife continuedbetween two factions of the Jewish religion, the Pharisees (“The separated”) andthe Sadducees (“The just”). The Romans captured Judea and Jerusalem in 63BC andafter a bitter conflict imposed on the people in 37BC an Arab Prince called KingHerod. Most members of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish Council and highest court ofjustice, opposed Herod and they were killed once he gained control. He alsocrushed the power of the Sadducees for their opposition to him and the Phariseesrose to ascendancy. Herod died in 4BC and the internal conflict returned. TheRomans assumed control and ruled through a series of procurators, one of whomwas called Pontius Pilatus.It was into this time and against this political and religious backdrop that achild was born called Jeshuah. The stories of his life would later be translatedinto Greek and it was then that the Jewish Jeshuah became the Greek version,Jesus. So the one thing we know for sure about Jesus is that his name wasn’tJesus! I will, however, continue to use that name here for simplicity andbecause it really doesn’t matter what he was called. It is what he did that isimportant. He was, I believe, born and brought up as an Essene. For two hundredyears before his birth a group called the Essenes or Therapeutae (meaninghealers) had lived in Egypt and Palestine. They were inspired by the Buddhistphilosophy more than the Jewish and it is likely that their beliefs originatedin India, although they must also have been influenced by Egyptian thought aswell. It is possible that Buddha, Socrates, and Jesus were the sameconsciousness and certainly the same overall higher self.The Jewish historian of the first century AD, Josephus, described the Essenes asthe most honest people in the world and he said they followed the values ofjustice and equality at all times. They were vegetarians and opposed animal orhuman sacrifice. They had a very different approach to life to the prevailingattitudes of the time. The Essenes had a number of centres in Egypt andPalestine and other lay members who lived in the general community, but they arebest known for their settlements at Qumran alongside the Dead Sea where the DeadSea Scrolls were found in 1947 and further down the shore at the giantflat-topped mountain called Masada. It was here that the Jews rebelling againstRoman rule would commit mass suicide rather than be captured in 73AD. I visitedboth places in a short, but unforgettable, visit to Israel in 1993, as describedin my autobiography. The love I felt flowing through me at those points wasindescribable. At Qumran I found myself speaking the words: ‘I forgive themeverything’, although I did not know why I said that or where the words camefrom.The Essenes were a brotherhood who worked a great deal in secret. But as Icontinue to stress, secrecy does not always mean conspiracy in times of greatreligious imposition. There have been times when keeping your beliefs andknowledge secret has been essential to your survival. I don’t believe theEssenes were the perfect people they are sometimes claimed to be, but overall Ifeel quite good about them and, anyway, I think Jesus was such a strongcharacter that he would have made his own mind up about things and not blindlyaccepted another belief system. In the American west there was once a farmercalled Maverick who refused to brand his animals. The word maverick became usedto describe people who refuse to be branded and linked to one organisation orgroup. I think that under that definition of the word, Jesus was a maverick.I believe that the man known as Joseph of Arimathea could have been the fatherof Jesus and not his uncle as the stories claim. This is a thought which keepscoming to me again and again, and others have channelled this information. Noone knows the background for sure, and it can only be speculation, but it isclear that Joseph of Arimathea was very close to Jesus. Joseph was an Essene, aswas Mary, and the Essenes possibly told her of a child she was being asked toconceive with Joseph of Arimathea to ensure that the right genetic combinationsinteracted. The Essenes believed this child had been foretold and Mary, thenonly a young girl of perhaps fourteen, agreed. The Joseph who is called herhusband in the gospels became the guardian of Jesus and fathered other childrenwith Mary. But the genetic father of Jesus was I feel Joseph of Arimathea. Thiswas a closely-guarded secret known only to a few. Joseph of Arimathea was a richlandowner and businessman and a member of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin.Keeping his close family connections to Jesus a secret was vital if he was toplay his part in the overall plan.We are looking here again at a highly significant incarnation of the volunteerconsciousness. The story of Jesus and others in the Middle East was only part ofwhat was happening at that time. All over the world other volunteers hadincarnated to co-ordinate their work. Most of them would not have known what washappening in Palestine, but all would have been coordinated from a higher levelin the same way that it is happening today. The early years of Jesus were spentwith the Essenes in Qumran and in Egypt opening up to his true self, andremembering who he was and why he was here. He would have been fed rubbish alongwith the enlightened explanations and it would have been up to him to see thedifference. Nothing changes. Jesus travelled further afield in the so called‘lost years’ which are left blank by the Bible. He passed through Mesopotamia onhis way to India and Kashmir and he was further influenced by the words ofBuddha. (See A Search for the Historical Jesus by Prof. F. Hassnain.) He spentseveral years with Buddhist thinkers and greatly impressed them with hisknowledge and understanding. He also journeyed to Greece and England. He mayhave travelled to Glastonbury and other places in England with Joseph ofArimathea who imported tin from Cornwall. All the time he was learning –remembering – and passing on this knowledge.He was also channelling highly-potent energies into the Earth’s energy grid. Hehad an energy field which allowed him to channel energies of immense power whichwould have ‘fried’ most other people. I am not saying for a moment that Jesusunderstood everything that was happening and exactly why he was doing certainthings. He would have simply felt impelled to do them. Certainly he would haveknown the potential consequences of returning from his travels to Palestine tochallenge the political, economic, and religious status quo, but the urgings ofhis higher self would have been almost impossible to ignore and he would havedone many things without, at the time, knowing why. It is like that feeling wehave when we know something is going to have an unpleasant outcome, but somehowwe go on walking into it. Know the feeling? Me, too.His open and verbal challenge to the established and destructive order was aneffort to wake people up by appealing directly to their lower consciousness. Ifthe higher consciousness could not communicate powerfully enough with the lowerconsciousness of the people then one way around that was to channel informationthrough another person, in this case Jesus, so that he could speak directly tothe lower consciousness by voice to ear. This is what all spiritualcommunicators come to do. I feel the area around Palestine, Egypt, and theMiddle East was the centre of the temporary energy grid created after the end ofAtlantis and an inter-dimensional gateway. If the consciousness of the peoplecould be raised in that part of the world it would have a considerable effect onthe planet, as would direct energy channelling into the grid at that point.These were the twin tasks of Jesus and those around him.It was, to say the least, not easy to achieve. Incarnating into the thick fog ofnegative, imbalanced, energy that was engulfing this planet made it eventougher. I know there are some who believe that everything that happens on Earthis meant to be and part of some grand Divine Plan. I don’t believe that. I feelmost strongly that what we see on Earth is evolution that has taken anunfortunate and unnecessary turn caused by this period of Luciferic opportunityand that the ability of the higher levels to affect the dense physical world isnot always that easy. There is a basic plan for what needs to be done, but thereis also much ad-libbing that goes on in reaction to human behaviour. Much ofthis behaviour is not the work or design of the Source or our own higher selves.It is the consequence of the negative energy imbalance, the density of thisfrequency, the Luciferic consciousness, and the utter nonsense which is passedon through the generations to indoctrinate each new generation of lower selveswith the same nonsense. So it was at the time of Jesus.I believe the idea that this man had to be nailed to a cross and die horribly inorder for some judgmental God to agree to forgive all the sins of humanity isthe most monumental nonsense I have ever heard. It never ceases to amaze me howmany believe it. I feel the power and privilege that Jesus was challengingconspired to silence him. The religious hierarchy worked with the Romans whoalso didn’t want this troublemaker to go on making waves. Forces of occupation,whether physical, economic, or mental, know that people who think for themselvesare dangerous; and people who encourage others to do the same are even more so.All the time the Luciferic consciousness is seeking to work through these peopleto achieve its ends. Jesus was nailed to a cross, the Roman punishment at thetime, but I do not believe he died there.From what I and others have channelled and written, I believe the following isat least quite close to the truth. Joseph of Arimathea was a central player inthe plan to ensure that Jesus did not die on the cross. He owned the area knownas the Garden of Gethsemane near the Mount of Olives just outside the city wallsof Jerusalem. As a member of the Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, he would haveknown exactly what was being said about Jesus. Another Essene member of theSanhedrin, the one called Nicodemus, also secretly supported Jesus and helpedhim as best he could. He, too, was an Essene. In fact there was a secret groupof Essenes unrecorded by history who worked on behalf of Jesus and the overallplan far more effectively than those called the ‘disciples’. Most of them didnot know the full story of what was going on most of the time because the morewho knew the more chance there was of something slipping out that would haveruined everything.Jesus, Joseph, and other Essenes devised a plan unknown to the disciples andeven to his mother Mary and his close companion, possibly his wife, MaryMagdalene. The plan was for Jesus to survive the cross while the authoritiesbelieved he was dead. There were three main reasons for this, though no doubtthere were others: (a) To take the pressure off those who were supporters ofJesus, including the Essenes, because there were many, including the Romans, whowere moving towards the belief that it was necessary to remove them. The publicdeath and humiliation of Jesus, their focal point, would disperse this growingdesire for a wholesale removal of his supporters and family. Joseph would haveknown this because of his close links with the Sanhedrin. He might even havesuggested this course of action as an alternative way of destroying thischallenge to the status quo. (b) They knew that people who question conventionoften have more influence on thinking when they are dead (or are believed to bedead) than they do when they were alive. Take the example of Confucius, forinstance. (c) To go through great pain and trauma with the intent of helping theEarth and humanity creates the energy of love in quite fantastic amounts andpower. And on the land owned by Joseph of Arimathea was one of the key points onthat central heart of the post-Atlantean grid. It was on this point that thecrucifixion would take place.Jesus knew all this and being a brilliant medium in constant touch with thehigher levels he would have channelled the basic themes. His secret group puttogether the plan under spiritual inspiration and the higher frequencies were atwork from their realms helping to make it happen as required. The timing had tobe perfect. Those who were crucified were left on the cross for as long as ittook for them to die, usually up to three days. Unless there was some way aroundthat, Jesus could not possibly have survived. The only way of shortening histime on the cross was to ensure that it happened in the hours before theSaturday, the Jewish Sabbath. No-one was allowed to be executed and buried onthat day and anyone still alive on the cross was killed before the start of theSabbath. The usual method was to break their legs with a series of blows. Thiswas fatal to anyone nailed by the wrists to a cross for rather gruesome reasonsI won’t go into. Therefore they had to find a way of giving the appearance thatJesus was dead before the end of the Friday.Jesus made his entrance into Jerusalem to coincide with the timing he and Josephhad worked out. He was intentionally provocative, openly and publiclycastigating the money lenders in the Temple, and generally stirring updiscontent with the Jewish and Roman authorities. He wanted to make them actagainst him immediately. The much-maligned Judas was crucial to the plot, too.He was in on the plan and he ‘betrayed’ Jesus at the moment necessary tomaintain the strict timing of the sequence of events. In the background, Josephand Nicodemus, were working away within the Sanhedrin to ensure they werereacting to schedule.The arrest of Jesus and the questioning by the Jewish hierarchy and Pilatefollowed the predicted time sequence and he was sentenced and nailed to thecross on the Friday. The crucifixion took place at a spot which adjoined theGarden of Gethsemane, owned by Joseph of Arimathea. If Jesus was thought to bestill alive by the end of that day he would have been killed to avoid the eventof his death running over into the Sabbath. The Essenes were well known fortheir knowledge of herbs and plants which they used in their healing. It wouldhave been no problem for them to provide a mixture that would give theappearance of physical death. Indeed there are many documented examples of suchdrugs in ancient cultures, including one called Toska, a drink made of sour wineand wormwood. It was given by Jewish women to those being crucified to help themlose consciousness. Again at the right time, a drug was given to Jesus on asponge which was put to his mouth with the excuse of giving him a drink. Soonafter this he appeared to expire. The emphasis is on the word ‘appeared’ becausealthough he was exhausted and in great pain and distress, he was still alive.One unfortunate event which had not been foreseen was when a soldier pierced hisside with a sword after he had been taken down. This produced much blood,another indication that he was taken from the cross alive. In the hours beforehis apparent ‘death’ he was the focal point in a vast energy channelling beingcoordinated by the higher levels right across the world. Volunteers incarnate inall cultures were involved although they would not have been aware that whatthey were doing was being mirrored all over the planet.Joseph of Arimathea went immediately to Pilate and asked for permission toremove the body of Jesus for burial. Pilate agreed after registering hissurprise that Jesus had died so quickly and asked for confirmation. Inpreparation for what was to happen, Joseph had built a tomb in the Garden ofGethsemane so that Jesus could be taken from the cross to the safety of the tombas quickly as possible. The quicker it happened the less chance there was thatsomeone would realise what was going on and the sooner he could be given medicaltreatment the better. A large stone was pushed across the entrance to ensure noone could see what was going on inside. Waiting in the tomb when Jesus wasbrought in were Essene healers in white robes and they began the healing processimmediately.Jesus was in a bad way, but the healers stabilised his condition. Under cover ofdarkness, the stone at the entrance to the tomb was pushed back and Jesus wastaken to the Essene community at Qumran via a safe house. After a longconvalescence, he recovered and left the region with Joseph and the two Marys tocontinue the work of energy channelling and passing on information. I feel hetravelled to places like Italy, Crete, France, and India where he might havedied a very old man in Kashmir. Some researchers believe he was known by manynames to different peoples and in Kashmir he was Yuzu Asaph. His tomb is stillthere. However, others believe that Jesus ended his life in France. During avision of the crucifixion which I had on one occasion, I channelled a series ofshort sentences which said:“Essenes, Qumran. Time to recover. Illusion complete. Opposition believe I amdead. Much travel. Long lifetime. Three children by two women.”Surviving a crucifixion may sound far-fetched, but Josephus the historiandocuments a story of a man known to him who was taken down from the cross aliveand survived. Josephus knew the man and pleaded with the Roman commander, Titus,for him to be spared. Titus agreed and the man was taken from the cross andgiven medical treatment. Still today in the Phillipines there are people whoagree to be nailed to the cross as part of some bizarre ritual to confirm theirfaith and when they are taken down after some hours they recover. So it waspossible to survive a crucifixion if you were not subjected to that horror fortoo long. Remember also that other levels would have been working to help Jesusduring that time and giving to him the energies and strength to keep himincarnate.The disciples, as I mentioned, were not in on the plan, apart from Judas who wasconsidered, rightly as it turned out, to be the most trustworthy! When the tombwas found to be empty and the great stone pushed back, it was assumed the bodyhad been stolen and later by some that Jesus had been resurrected – i.e. thathis physical body had gone to Heaven. In fact he was recovering in a safe housewith his Essene healers before being taken on to Qumran. Jesus had used theJewish belief in a Messiah figure and the predictions of previous Jewishprophets to create interest in himself and therefore his words. It was likebuilding a public platform from which he could speak his truths. He would stresshow events in his life had been written in the ancient prophecies, but he andhis secret support group were creating those events so they would match theprophecies. It was part of the plan to use the Jewish belief system to createinterest and notoriety. Most of the disciples were not aware of this. Theirinability to commit themselves totally to the work and understand its importancefrustrated him and he was much closer to Joseph and his secret group. The onescalled the disciples were a sort of ‘front’ for what was really going on behindthe scenes and for that to work and appear credible it was vital that they hadno knowledge of what was happening. They were very important to the work, butonly if they didn’t know the full story.The plan worked magnificently in that everyone was fooled and Jesus achievedwhat he and his family and supporters came to achieve in relation to the energygrid. He also left behind a lot of people who were moved and motivated by hissimple truths about love, Creation, and the eternal nature of all consciousness.The myths that were now to surround him made him far better known than ever hewas in his lifetime in Palestine. No mention has been found of him in the worksof the history writers of the time and yet look what has been written about himsince his life was hijacked by the religion called Christianity. Others havechannelled and seen the same basic story that I have outlined and researchersworking purely from historical information (plus some higher inspiration) havecome up with the same themes, too. What I have no doubt about are the following:The overall reason for the Jesus incarnation; that he did not die on the cross;and that he was not celibate. I feel he was married to or at least the closecompanion of Mary Magdalene with whom he had children and that he fathered achild with at least one other woman, possibly Mary Magdalene’s sister, Martha.This might make some Church people reel back in horror, but the energy patternsthat Jesus brought into incarnation would not have been wasted. They would havebeen passed on through the genetic line. This could well have meant that heneeded to interact physically with more than one other energy field to createparticular energy and genetic combinations. I talk more of this process ofsexual interaction and the many reasons for it in my book, Heal The World.We should not forget, I feel, that Jesus was only one of the volunteerincarnations, although a highly significant one. He played an effective andcouragous part in helping the Earth and humanity, but so have millions ofothers. It has been a continuous, on-going, process and not something thathappened only once 2,000 years ago. He was very much a man of this physicallevel while being in close contact with his higher self. He had the emotions ofcompassion, love, and at times anger. He spoke his mind and the idea that hewent around in some spiritual mist talking kindly to everyone is well wide ofthe mark, I would say. Yes, he was kind to people and he had great love for theEarth and humanity, but sometimes love involves speaking out vehemently againstinjustice if that is what is necessary for change to happen and for people toawaken. It is such an irony that it is the way his lifetime was to bemisrepresented that has made him the most famous of the volunteer incarnations.After Jesus left Palestine with the two Marys, Joseph of Arimathea and others,the followers of his teachings (Jesuians) were, apart from the Essenes, smalloffshoots of the Jewish religion like the Gnostics and Ebionites. There was nooverall belief system and they each held different views about the details andmeaning of his life. Most of them did, however, believe in his return or SecondComing which is an ancient idea that goes back to Sun worship. Once again theseearly groups of Jesus followers were guided by channellers and you can see thesereferred to in the ancient texts as ‘vessels’ for the holy spirit who werefilled with the ‘Spirit of the Lord.’ We read of people being filled with theHoly Spirit and then speaking the words of the Lord. Anyone who has experiencedor witnessed channelling will know that an energy descends upon the channeller.This is the communicating consciousness enveloping and synchronising with thephysical vehicle or vessel through which it seeks to communicate. It is thisenergy which channellers and onlookers feel that became termed the ‘holy spirit’in ancient times. These Jesus-inspired groups were much like a spiritualistChurch of today with people gathered to hear the communications of the medium,the ones blessed with ‘charismata’, the Greek word for psychic abilities.It was only when the man we call St Paul came on the scene that Jesus, the wiseand courageous philosopher, healer, and channel, was turned into the pagansaviour-god depicted by Christianity. Paul was an orthodox Jew who persecutedthose sects which followed a belief in the philosophy of Jesus. This changeddramatically after he claimed to have seen a vision of Jesus on the road toDamascus. This could have been a psychic vision of a non-physical entity, or athree-dimensional holographic figure projected from a spacecraft, or he couldhave made it all up. But the latter is unlikely because from then on he clearlybelieved that Jesus was communicating with him and asking to be proclaimedMessiah and Saviour of the World. Paul was following the age-old custom ofpeople believing that every ghost they saw or psychic communication theyexperienced was from God, the Highest One, or in this case God’s ‘son’. Whatappalling consequences this was to have.We should remember that Paul came from a place called Tarsus in Asia Minor andthere they worshipped a Greek pagan Saviour-god called Dionysus – their versionof Bel. Dionysus was said to have been born to a virgin impregnated by the godZeus and suffered and died to save humanity. Paul clearly saw Jesus as anotherincarnation of Dionysus, the one he learned about in Tarsus. All he did wastransfer the myths about Dionysus to the philosopher called Jesus. Dionysus wasthe Greek Christ and the second in a trinity of Demeter, Dionysus, andPersephone in the same vein as other pagan gods throughout the Middle East.Dionysus was known as ‘Our Lord’, ‘the Vine’, ‘the Saviour’, ‘the Judge of theDead’, ‘the Deliverer’, ‘the Born Again’, and ‘the Only Begotten Son of God’.Above the head of Dionysus were depicted the words ‘I am Life, Death, andResurrection, I hold the winged crown’. He is also claimed to have said: ‘I amat one with my father in heaven’, and a service called the Eukharistia whichinvolved animal sacrifice was performed in his honour. Paul was fundamentallyinfluenced by the Greek Mystery (Brotherhood) beliefs and saviour god myths andthese became fused in his mind with Jewish dogma. If they were controlled by thenegative aspects of the Brotherhood at the time, they could have set him up andmind-controlled him to do what he did, and believe what he saw (or didn’t) wasJesus. The lamb dying so our sins could be forgiven would have been a basic partof his belief system and he would have had no trouble linking this ancient paganmyth to Jesus. People who were sacrificed on the altars for thousands of yearswere seen in the same light. From these beginnings did Paul found what becamethe Christian Faith. Jesus didn’t start Christianity. Paul did. I am notsuggesting for a moment that Saul of Tarsus (St Paul) set out to cause all thehorrors that his misunderstandings would create. He probably did it with thebest of intentions and believed everything he said. I am sure the same can besaid for most of those who followed him as guides and manipulators of theChristian faith. They, themselves, were being manipulated.Paul set off on his travels to tell people what Jesus was saying through him.His letters are reported in the New Testament. He made his living making tentson his journeys and three years after he saw his ghost or vision, or whatever itwas, he arrived in Jerusalem to meet the disciple Peter and James, the brotherof Jesus. They didn’t think much of him and they opposed his views about Jesus.Paul admits he never knew or met Jesus in his lifetime, but he believed Jesuswas now speaking to him from the world of the gods. This, he thought, made himmuch more knowledgeable about him than the disciples. There was a split betweenthe believers in Jesus as a man and philosopher and the Pauline Christians whofollowed his belief in a recycled Dionysus, who, incidentally, was said to havebeen born on December 25th. This relates to the ancient cult of the Sun God inwhich the periods of mid-winter, mid-summer, and the solstices and seasons wereseen as sacred times. Paul’s Christianity was to win the day and pagan priestswere absorbed into his Church. They had no problem being converted, because tothem Jesus was just another pagan Saviour-god in the image of those they wereused to. With their arrival Christianity became even more paganised.The pagan religion called Mithraism was also absorbed into the Pauline versionof Christianity. Mithraism worshipped the saviour-god, Mithra, (see Dionysus,Bel, Osiris, Krishna, et al) and they celebrated his birthday on December 25th,the beginning of their winter. Names like Mithra and Dionysus were simplychanged to Jesus and so we have the Christian Christmas Day. Mithra was alsobelieved to have risen from the dead at Easter and thepagans-turned-Christian-pagans welcomed that Festival into the Christian beliefsystem. According to the Mithraists, Sunday was ‘the Lord’s Day’ and theEucharist, the baptism of babies, the idea of father, son, and holy spirit, thevirgin mother giving birth to the saviour, the marriage service and so much morewere taken from various streams of paganism and added to Christianity. Thesepagan beliefs were a mixture of extra-terrestrial ‘gods’, channelling andvisions, the movement of the Sun through the seasons and the sky, and downrightmake-believe. As we have seen, the idea of Jesus as ‘the lamb of God’ dying soour sins could be forgiven goes back to pagan animal sacrifices in which thelamb was said to take the place of humanity to quell the anger of the gods.Mithraism was now Myth-raism – better known as Christianity.It is worth pointing out that far from claiming that Jesus was born by divineintervention without intercourse, the oldest Greek and Syrian manuscripts say‘Joseph begat Jesus’. The idea of the virgin birth was a later insertion, aswere all the additions that fostered the myth that Jesus the philosopher wasChrist the saviour-god. Even the word Christ is of pre-Christian origin asChrest (Egypt) and Christos (Greek). The story of the virgin birth of theEgyptian Son of God, Horus, has been found on a temple wall in Luxor and thatwas depicted long before Christianity was even thought of. In these early yearsof the Christian Church many changes were made to texts to justify theinventions. Words were attributed to Jesus which said: ‘He that believeth and isbaptised shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned’. This wasadded to increase the power of the Church and the priests.The priests took over the Pauline version of Jesus and this was such an enormousirony given that Jeshuah, the Jewish philosopher, challenged the whole idea ofpriests. The original Jesuian form of worship was overpowered by what becameChristianity, that misguided mixture of pagan and Jewish myths and stories, someof which carry themes of symbolic and hidden truth, many of which are utterrubbish. Only the names changed, not the stories and myths. Cyprian, who died in258AD, was the Bishop of Carthage and he did more than most to secure thepriestly takeover. It was he who promoted the belief that only those who becameChristians would have salvation. He said people should not have their ownopinions – only those which the Church decided they should have. What power thiswould give to the priests in the centuries that followed to serve the desires ofthe Luciferic master.The values of the brave and brilliant philosopher, healer, and channel calledJeshuah had been all but obliterated by Paul’s recycled paganism and thedarkness of ignorance and pain was to descend upon the human race for nearly twothousand years. This happened after Christianity’s most important victory, itsacceptance as the state Church of the Roman Empire. For that we have to thank,though that is hardly the word, a Roman Emperor called Constantine the Great."},{"pageContent":"5Hell on EarthCONSTANTINE I became Emperor of all the Roman lands in 312AD and within thirteenyears he had, in effect, decided the future for much of humanity for nearly twomillennia.Constantine ‘the Great’ as he was to become known, served as a soldier and won areputation for courage and military prowess. After spending some time serving inBritain he was elected by his army as Caesar of the West. He determined to beEmperor of all, and began the process of killing his rivals and sometimes theirchildren, too. The Christian legend is that at the scene of one of his battlesfor the Roman throne he had a vision of a cross. It was at the battle of MilvianBridge, near Rome and he is said to have seen the cross in the sky with thewords ‘By this Conquer’. The following night he is claimed to have seen a visionof Jesus who told him to put the cross symbol on his flag to guarantee victoryover his enemies. Yes, that sounds like just what the Prince of Peace would say,doesn’t it?This whole story is probably another Christian invention, but for some reasonConstantine began to look kindly on the Christians. The Brotherhood would havebeen working behind the scenes somewhere, I feel sure. Constantine issued theEdict of Milan which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.Some Christians had been persecuted horribly in earlier years although Gibbon,the historian who made a study of this, concluded that the numbers have beengreatly exaggerated. He believes something like 2,000 Christians were murderedand tortured in the pre-Constantine period while 25 million are estimated tohave been executed in the centuries that followed for the crime of not acceptingthe Christian faith. Both figures are terrible, but it puts what was to unfoldinto some perspective.Constantine thought a cross was a lucky mascot, and in fact the cross as areligious symbol goes back to the time when humans discovered that by rubbingtwo sticks together you can make fire. They believed that fire was a god and twocrossed sticks were seen as sacred. The cross can be found on ancient graves andwas a religious symbol in Egypt, Assyria, Persia, India, Mexico and Scandinavia,long before Christianity. The Egyptians saw their cross, or crux ansata, assymbolic of salvation and eternal life, and our old friends the Mithraistsmarked the foreheads of the newly initiated with the sign of the cross. Ancientstories also describe how human sacrifices were bound to a cross and anointedwith oil, so they would burn better on the altar. From such bleak traditions hasChristianity come.Constantine was never a Christian as such and he only agreed to be baptised onhis death bed, no doubt as a bit of insurance. He worshipped both Jesus and theGreek god, Apollo, and he remained the head of the Pagan Church as PontifexMaximus. But he gave Christianity the same status as the others and madesubstantial donations to its cause. Significantly he allowed the Church toreceive legacies which had been banned up to this point and from here theChristian Church would begin to accumulate fantastic wealth as people tried tobuy a place in heaven. Constantine’s efforts to increase the Christian ranks ledto bribes for the poor if they became Christians, and the offer of good jobs towealthy Pagans who converted to the faith.Constantine became concerned when disputes began to erupt between differentChristian beliefs. A churchman called Arius in Alexandria questioned the ideathat Jesus was the same as God. How could a son be the same as his father andhad not Jehovah said that only he was God? When the Bishop of Alexandria,appropriately named Alexander, was preaching about the trinity of father, son,and holy spirit, Arius publicly questioned him. You may not think it importantin the great tapestry of life to decide if Jesus was only a vehicle for God orpart of three gods in one, but it now became the question that had to bedecided. Arius left Alexandria for Palestine in fear of his life and twofactions emerged. Neither would give way and this conflict was being ridiculedthroughout the Empire by the non-believers and was no doubt fuelled by theBrotherhood. Constantine had wanted, at least in part for political reasons, tomake Christianity the state religion, but he could not do this unless thedisputes were settled.He called together the bishops at Nicaea which is now Iznik in Turkey where hehad a palace. At their first meeting in June 325 no agreement could be reachedbetween the 318 bishops on the burning issue of the day: was Jesus part of atrinity of father, son, and holy spirit – whatever that was supposed to mean?Constantine arrived shortly after murdering his wife and elder son. He moved theproceedings to his palace and presided over all that followed. He said adecision had to be reached because only when that happened could Christianity bethe state Church. It is clear he wasn’t much bothered what they decided as longthey decided something. A bitter argument broke out between the factions asdocuments were torn up and blows were struck. This is the atmosphere in whichthe Christian creed was officially decided. Constantine agreed to a motion whichwas accepted by the majority though vehemently opposed by Arius and hissupporters. It became known as the Nicene Creed and it read as follows:“We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things, both visibleand invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son of God, begotten of theFather, only begotten, that is to say, of the same substance of the Father, Godof God and Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made, being ofone substance with the father, by whom all things were made, both things inheaven and things on earth; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down andwas made flesh, made man, suffered and rose again on the third day, went up intothe heavens, and is to come again to judge the quick and the dead; and in theholy ghost.”There is a saying which goes: ‘A camel is a horse designed by a committee.’ Ifever there was an example of that it is the above. I find it interesting alsothat this official creed of Christianity talks of ‘for us men and oursalvation’. What about women? But then it would not be until 1545 that the RomanChurch officially agreed that women had souls – and then only by a majority ofthree votes!The Jewish philosopher, healer, and medium called Jeshuah was now officially asaviour-god who, like the lambs on the pagan sacrificial altars, died so thatour sins could be forgiven forever as long as we believed in him as our saviour.It is worth remembering that this decision on who Jesus was came 300 years afterhis death. It was also made by people who believed the Earth was flat andJerusalem was the centre of the Universe; this decision remains the foundationsof the Christian Church to this day. Before the Council of Nicaea closed,Constantine agreed to a motion that Arius and his followers be officially cursedand either executed, imprisoned, or banished. Other decrees applied the sameChristian justice to all who read any writings by those who now became known asArians. The Arian view is still expressed today, incidentally, by theUnitarians.Thousands of Arians were murdered, the first of the estimated 25 million victimswho would die in the name of Christianity and that is not including those whowould perish in religious wars and the estimated 12 million who were killed inthe Christian conquest of the Americas. Added together world-wide the number whoperished as a result of the Christian religion must easily pass 100 million. Tobe excommunicated by the Church was almost a death sentence in itself, becauseyou could not be guilty of murder if you killed someone who was excommunicated.Arius, however, escaped death to continue to expound his cause and the argumentswent on over the trinity. In about 336 Constantine even ordered that Arius bereadmitted to the Church, but before this could be done Arius died in mysteriouscircumstances and the following year Constantine passed on, also. On his deathbed he was baptised by a bishop who did not accept the trinity. By then he hadmoved the capital of the empire from Rome to Byzantium – now Turkey – and hebuilt a new city which he called Constantinople. It was about 44 miles fromNicaea. Here he had built Christian churches and dedicated the city to theVirgin Mary and Christianity was to become the State Church of the Roman Empire.This Romanized Christianity was later given the name Roman Catholicism todistinguish it from the Protestant version. All that happened, in reality, wasthat the previous Roman state saviour, Mithra, was renamed Jesus Christ.Constantine’s mother, Helena, was sent to Jerusalem to find the biblical sitesand she claimed to have found the exact locations of the birth of Jesus, hiscrucifixion, the tomb, and even where he ascended into the sky. It was on hersay-so that Constantine built a basilica in 326 on the spot where she said Jesushad been crucified. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is on that site today andattracts millions of Christian pilgrims to the place where Jesus hung on thecross. Or, rather, where Helena said it happened. She was obviously quite asleuth, because during her trip she claimed to have found the three woodencrosses involved in the crucifixion three hundred years after they were supposedto have been used!!The names of three people are worth emphasising in these early years of theChristian Church – Augustine, Jerome, and Ambrose. Arthur Findlay in his studyof the Church likens them to the Nazis, Hitler, Goebbels, and Himmler. When youcompare their backgrounds and behaviour, it is hard to argue against that, butbefore we start condemning them as individuals we need to ask who, or what, wasin control of them? I would stress that I am not condemning anyone in this book.I am looking at thought and behaviour patterns which have guided human history.The individuals involved are victims of those patterns as much as the people whosuffered from their actions. Forgive them, they know not what they do, is a goodline to remember when reading the next few chapters. Augustine imposed atyrannical rule and used force and fear to swell the Christian ranks. He wouldquote the words of Jesus to justify his actions: ‘Compel them to come in, thatmy house be filled’, and ‘But those mine enemies, which would not that I reignover them, bring hither and slay them before me’. These were quoted to excusethe murder or forced conversion of non-believers. Yet these quotations, as with‘I come not to bring peace, but a sword’, and others, were inventions. They wereinserted into the texts as justification of war, murder, and endless otherhorrors in the name of the ‘Prince of Peace’. Augustine sought to impose aglobal creed by exterminating the opposition. Religious ‘error’, he said, mustbe treated like treason, a crime against the state, and be punished as such. Hesaid that babies who died before they were baptised would, like all theunbaptised, be condemned to hell for all eternity, and he used fear of death andthe fear of hell and damnation after death, to expand his vicious and ignorantcreed. He would, like Jerome and Ambrose, later be declared a saint.Jerome, born in 341, was the man responsible for producing the texts for thefirst ‘Holy’ Bible. It was he, also, who led the campaign of persecution againstthe mediums and channellers who had been at the centre of religious belief fromthe very start of human existence. In a short time, the gift of communicatingwith other frequencies would be a death sentence. The channellers were replacedby the priests as the ‘middle men’ between God and humanity. Channellers whowere frauds in the past had made up communications to make the people dowhatever they wished, and now the priests would do the same without the need tostage a fraudulent channelling. But, as always, there were many genuinechannellers who were communicating with other levels, and their communicatorswere opposing the Church’s beliefs and behaviour. They had to be shut up andthey were. Countless numbers were tortured and murdered as witches. Priestlyrule had arrived. As Jerome put it:“We tell them (the channellers) that we do not so much reject prophecy(channelling), as refuse to receive prophets (channellers) whose utterances failto accord with the Scriptures old and new.”In other words we don’t mind people channelling as long as what they communicatesupports what we have decided is truth. And as the Church had control of the‘scriptures’ they could change whatever they liked to support their view. Thephilosopher Celsus wrote of this in the third century. He said of the religioushierarchy:“You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of making them seemlikely … You have altered three, four, times and oftener the texts of your ownGospels in order to deny objections made to you.”There were so many differing beliefs in the first three centuries after the lifeof Jesus that no two gospels or epistles (letters claimed to be from apostles)were alike. Bits had been added, deleted, and changed to fit the beliefs ofthose who possessed them. Modern research has shown that the text of Mark wasthe first of the ‘Bible’ gospels to be written and the others merely copied thatand put in their own additions. Earlier texts from which Mark and other Gospelwriters copied have been lost, but even so there were other writings about Jesuswhich the Church rejected, as we will see. No one knows who wrote the biblicaltexts, when, and from what personal direction they were coming. Yet this is thebook that has controlled the evolution of much of the world for the best part oftwo thousand years! Jerome’s suppression of truth and alternative thought wastwo-fold. He persuaded the Pope to make channelling a crime and the Oracles andVessels of God became, with one Papal decree, Oracles and Vessels of the Devil,names still used by many within the Church today. And he also took control ofthe ancient texts and made them fit his image of truth. Jerome became secretaryto Pope Damasus in about 382 and he was commissioned to bring together all thevarious texts into a book which reflected (his) orthodox belief.It was now that the texts were made to fit the view that Jeshuah the philosopherwas no less than Jesus the Christ who had died so that our sins would beforgiven. Jerome’s rewriting of ancient texts and the rejection of anything hedidn’t agree with, produced the wording which became the New Testament.Christians believe this to be the word of Jesus and God. It isn’t. It is largelythe word of Jerome. The additions and deletions by Jerome and others created acontradictory mess. The Bible tells us, for example, that the genetic line ofJesus can be traced back from his father Joseph to King David. But how can thisbe if Joseph played no part in his conception? In fact both the genetic line andthe idea of the virgin birth were additions to the texts.Jerome and Augustine looked through thirteen gospels, nine acts and teachings ofthe Apostles, thirty-one epistles, and other writings, and decided which were‘orthodox’ and which were not. Surprise, surprise, they agreed that the onesJerome had doctored were orthodox and the rest should be discarded, and it wasthese that the Council of Carthage agreed should be accepted by the Church. Someof those that were rejected were much nearer the truth than those that becamethe New Testament. Pope Innocent I confirmed the decision at Carthage, and ahundred years later Pope Gelasius I decreed that only these approved writings(called canonical) were to be read in churches. Those who disobeyed were to betortured and killed as heretics. Jerome also turned his mind to re-writing thetexts that became the Old Testament, but even his faith in these as the Word ofGod was challenged by all the contradictions he found. He had to admit that hisefforts to make sense of it could only be considered makeshift. When the twotestaments were brought together in the 6th century the Old, which Jerome didn’treally understand, was joined with the New, which Jerome had edited to suit hisbeliefs. By these methods was the Holy Bible created and Jehovah, the vengefulGod of the Jews and quite possibly extra-terrestrials, became merged with theGod of Jesus. Is it any wonder that it produced a book so full of blatantcontradictions? Fortunately some themes of truth have survived and particularlysome of the written and numerical symbols and codes that the original textscontained. Many of these have been retained because the forgers and editors likeJerome did not understand their significance. To them they were just numbers orliteral stories. But some are codes and symbols waiting for those who have theunderstanding to decipher them.After Constantine’s death, there had been a period when Pagan and Arian beliefshad their supporters among the Roman Emperors. During one period under theEmperor Constantius believers in the trinity were persecuted when he acceptedthe Arian view. Whoever had prominence it was still a case of Christians killingChristians in an argument over the trinity or no trinity. Then the EmperorTheodosius ‘the Great’ came to power in 379, and with him so did orthodox(Jeromian) Christianity. Theodosius was a staunch supporter of the Nicene Creedwho ordered the slaughter of 1,500 men, women, and children on one occasionalone in retaliation for the murder of one of his commanders and some soldiers.He issued the laws which were to be known as the Theodosian Code. These orderedimprisonment, torture, death or banishment for the crime of the heresy of notaccepting the Nicene Creed. He also appointed a group of priests called TheInquisitors of the Faith. Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, was the founder of theHoly Inquisition which was to turn a large tract of the world into a humanabbatoir. Wars were fought over the imposition of the Christian Orthodox(Nicene) Faith and tens of millions would be killed in the most terrible ways inthe name of Christianity. The Brotherhood organisations were being controlledmore and more by negative intent. They were gaining ever greater control ofevents as their membership and offshoots grew ever more quickly. Now theLuciferic consciousness was not only in control of the Church, it was theChurch. This was to continue into modern times. The Inquisition Office is nowcalled the Holy Office.The further erosion of truth came with the Emperor Justinian in the 6th century.From his headquarters in Constantinople he schemed to have references topre-existence and reincarnation removed from the Bible. He convened the SecondSynod Council of Constantinople in 553 which, even without the attendance orsupport of the Pope, agreed that:“If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls and shall submit to themonstrous doctrine that follows from it, let him be .. excommunicated.”The spiritual truths that were being passed on through the Brotherhood, atcertain levels of it, anyway, were now destroyed in the public arena. The ‘GreatWork of Ages’ or, to give it its modern name, The New World Order, was right oncourse in its desire to part human beings from the knowledge of who they are.With the fall of the Roman Empire, the Christian Church took its place and thePope became the equivalent of the Roman Emperor. A sufficient number of thetribes and peoples who replaced Roman rule were Christianised for the view ofthe Roman Catholic Church to prevail. Now the power of the Church was total.They believed that, because the Old Testament said that Adam had incurred God’swrath by eating from the tree of knowledge, the pursuit of all knowledge outsideof the Bible was sinful. In the same way, because Eve had tempted him to eatfrom the tree, women were considered to be evil and of no worth. Thesebreathtaking interpretations and the fear of the Inquisition was to hold backhuman evolution for at least two thousand years. Today’s scientificestablishment is still not as advanced in its overall understanding of life andCreation as were Socrates, Plato, and others in Ancient Greece.The Christians destroyed all the writings of the great philosophers. Plato’sAcademy and Aristotle’s Lyceum were closed and their writings burned. The Romaneducational system inspired by Quintilian was dismantled and the great libraryat Alexandria became a theological college. Philosophers, scientists, and schoolteachers were persecuted. Hypatia, one of the outstanding women of her time, hadher flesh torn from her body by a Christian mob for the ‘crime’ of speakingeloquently on science, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy in ways thatcontradicted orthodox Christianity. She worked at the library in Alexandria andall the books it contained were then destroyed. This was all done in the name ofCyril, the Archbishop of Alexandria. He was later made a saint.I can recommend a book called The Vicars of Christ which is a record of theCatholic popes by a former Roman Catholic priest, Peter Da Rosa. It is a superbexposé of the hypocrisy and deceit upon which Christianity was built. Andremember, until the Reformation and the birth of the Protestant version in the16th century, the Rome-controlled Catholic Church was Christianity. The Vaticanhad a whole department dedicated to producing forged ‘historical’ documents tohoodwink kings, queens, and others into doing their will. In most cases theChurch’s ‘will’, as, increasingly, with the Brotherhood, was for them to wagewar on non-believers or to hand over land and money to add to their, by now,amazing wealth.The post of Pope was not spiritual, but commercial, and the negative Brotherhoodsocieties made every effort to make sure that ‘their’ men or someone who waseasily manipulated got the job. The Vatican to this day is run by theBrotherhood. If they could control the Pope, the potential to create wars andimpose their will was almost infinite. Popes were considered by many to be‘infallible’, the mouthpiece of God, and whatever they wanted they had to begiven. As a result the Papacy attracted all the wrong characters for all thewrong reasons. One pope was so unhinged that he had the body of a previous popeexhumed from the grave and brought to his room. He ordered that the rottingremains were sat down in a chair so he could tell him what he thought of him!Apparently, one of the Pope’s staff stood behind the dead pope answering on hisbehalf like some ventriloquist with a dummy. It is sobering to think that suchmisguided people were making decisions that would affect the lives of humanityup to the present day. Or was it always they who actually made the decisions?Probably not. Either way, we still have Roman Catholic priests who must staycelibate and unmarried because of what popes – or their controllers – decided athousand years ago and more. The story went like this:325AD: The Council of Nicaea decides that no priests will be allowed to marryafter their ordination.385AD: Pope Siricius decrees that men who are married before their ordinationmust not sleep with their wives afterwards.590 – 604AD: Pope Gregory the Great decides that all desire for sex is sinful.Sex is only for producing children.1074AD: Pope Gregory VII says that all priests must pledge themselves to becelibate.The consequences of the Roman Catholic hang-ups about sex have been to pass onthis ‘dirty’, ‘sinful’, view of sexual love to the generations that followed.Even today we still see its legacy. We are also seeing many stories coming tolight of Roman Catholic priests and their sexual abuse of children. The Vaticanseeks to avoid responsibility for this, but at the core of such behaviour is theforced suppression of natural sexual urges imposed by Papal dictators betweenten and seventeen centuries ago and upheld by successive Papal dictators eversince. But they can’t change it because to do so would make it clear that PopeGregory VII was fallible in ordering such a ridiculous rule. And as popes areconsidered infallible, none of them can change – at least publicly – what aprevious one has decided!The idea of ‘sinful’ sex was promoted by Augustine. He was well-known for hislove of sex earlier in his life, but when he claimed to have abstained, he tookon a view of sex that was similar to the way some people who stop smoking seeothers who continue to smoke. He became obsessive in his condemnation, and wouldnot allow a woman to enter his house unaccompanied. This included his sister.Such was his power within the Church that his belief that sex and lust weresinful became the accepted view. The suppression of the flow of creative energyactivated by natural sexual activity has expressed itself in negative emotionsand behaviour, as well as health problems resulting from blocked energy. Usingthe ‘safe period’ to enjoy sex without conceiving was condemned as a wicked sinby Augustine. You should never have sexual relationships unless you intend toconceive a child, they decided, and even then under no circumstances must youenjoy it!! This nonsense continues to blight the lives of so many to this day. Ihave always found it hilarious that the Church says that God made the physicalbody, but we should be so ashamed of this creation that we must never allowothers to see it or, at the extreme, even see it ourselves. But Augustine’s viewon love, marriage, and sex was followed by the Church from then on. As he saidover and over again:“Husbands love your wives, but love them chastely. Insist on the work of theflesh only in such measure as is necessary for the procreation of children.Since you cannot beget children in any other way [an oversight by God,presumably], you must descend to it against your will, for it is the punishmentof Adam.”Poor old Adam and Eve. They get it in the neck for everything, even the factthat we have to be punished by being forced to have sex. Augustine linked sexwith ‘original sin’, the idea that we are all born sinful. If we are conceivedthrough the sexual act, we are by definition born with original sin which issupposed to go back to Adam and Eve. Jesus was the only one born withoutoriginal sin, because his was a virgin birth which did not involve sex. Followthe logic? Later to overcome the obvious contradiction that Jesus was born to amother who was born with original sin, she, too, was said to have been conceivedwithout sex. But hold on. In that case, Jesus was born without original sin to amother without original sin, but she was born to a mother with original sin.Shock, horror. Unless of course, the grandmother of Jesus was also conceivedwithout sex. In that case…. No, no, I think we’ll leave it there. You see howconfusing it gets once you try to cover your tracks? It is the same whenever youtell lies. You have to keep lying to cover up previous lies and you get yourselfin a terrible mess. The Roman Church also conveniently ignores the fact that theone they consider to be the first pope, the ‘disciple’ Peter, was married andnot celibate. From this insult to the intelligence has come a view of sex, thephysical body, marriage, divorce, and women that was to prevail for nearly twothousand years. The suppression of women has been passed through the generationsby the major religions. Christian dogma used the Adam and Eve story in theJewish Old Testament to justify this. They also quote people like St Paul:“Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife as Christis the head of the Church. Now if the Church submits to Christ so should wivessubmit to their husbands in everything.”And:“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but tobe in silence.”In the last years of the 20th century, the Bible is still being quoted inopposition to women priests. When the Church of England voted in favour of theadmission of women to the priesthood in 1993, members of the Church resigned inprotest and joined the Roman Catholics – some of them women! Male domination inall areas of life has helped to extend the domination of male energy over femalewhich has made the world what it is today. This has served Lucifer’s ambitionsmagnificently. A domination of male energy over female is vital to his plans.All consciousness is both male and female, and we all have male and female livesto ensure a balance of experiences. The current transformation will see are-balancing of the male-female energies around the planet and this willmanifest in the emergence of women in decision-making and the activation offemale energies, like caring and compassion, within those in male bodies. Bothmen and women are capable of expressing male and female energy.The Christian obsession with destroying paganism, while at the same timeabsorbing it, led to a further polluting of the Earth energy grid, as did allthe negative energy being created by the murder and mayhem. Early churches werebuilt on Pagan sacred sites. Some sects knew about the energies and wanted touse them, and others considered these energies and sites to be evil and wishedto suppress the energies (the ‘dragon’). This is where I feel the legends of StGeorge and the dragon originated. Churches all over the world are built onacupuncture points and chakras and I visit many in the course of my own work.All that fear, guilt, and suffering which has been experienced on those sitesand the concentration on the crucifixion have generated immense quantities ofnegative energy and this has poured into the grid. Those churches that have beenjoyous have produced positive energy, but they have been the tiny, tiny,minority.This was a terrible time for the volunteers and those who were trying to restoreunderstanding to the human mind. They incarnated in other parts of the world forlives dedicated to channelling energy into the grid to try to compensate forwhat Christianity and Islam (of which more shortly) were doing. Those who wereborn into the Christian world lived simple lives keeping their heads down andchannelling the energy or doing what they could to speak out before facing theinevitable and often gruesome fate. Many found themselves guided to monasterieswhich were built on energy sites and were protected by law from anyinterference.One spiritual group which grew rapidly in France and Northern Italy in the 12thand 13th centuries and challenged the power of Rome was the Cathars orAlbigenses. It was based on an understanding of reincarnation and the eternalnature of all consciousness. They were vegetarians and communicated psychicallywith other frequencies. Their views won such support that the influence of theChristian Church began to wane in Southern France around Albi. Pope Innocent IIreacted to this with one of the most appalling examples of inhumanity seen onthis planet. What followed was genocide. Men, women and children weredismembered or were burnt alive in the name of Jesus and God. The events at thecastle of Monsegur are best remembered in the Cathar story, but there were manyother ‘glorious’ victories for the Christian armies that were just as sickening.One ploy of Innocent II, and later of Pope Gregory IX, was to tell his‘crusaders’ that no matter what they did he would forgive them on God’s behalf.What a shock they must have had when they left the physical body and realisedthey were responsible through karma for all they had done.As the centuries passed the Holy Inquisition went into overdrive. The DominicanOrder was put in charge of this religious version of Murder Incorporated. PopeGregory IX declared: ‘It is the duty of every Catholic to persecute heretics’.There was no fair trial before a sentence. The Inquisitors’ decision was final.It was a wonderful way of getting rid of people you didn’t like, especially ifyou were one of the Brotherhood elite who wished to remove those who weregetting in your way. You told the Inquisitors that your enemies werenon-believers, and you stood back and watched them burned to death. This passageis from a book of guidance from the Church to inquisitors:“Either the person confesses and he is proved guilty from his own confession, orhe does not confess and is equally guilty on the evidence of witnesses. If aperson confesses the whole of what he is accused of, he is unquestioninglyguilty of the whole; but if he confesses only a part, he ought still to beregarded as guilty of the whole, since what he has confessed proves him to becapable of guilt as to other points of the accusation… Bodily torture is left tothe Judge of the Inquisition, who determines according to age, sex, and theconstitution of the party… If, not withstanding, all the means employed, theunfortunate wretch still denies his guilt, he is to be conside as a victim ofthe devil; and, as such, deserves no compassion from the servants of God, norpity and indulgence of Holy Mother Church; he is a son of perdition. Let himperish among the damned.”Even genuine believers were murdered by the Inquisitors, but the Church’s mottowas that it was better for a hundred ‘innocents’ to die than for one heretic togo on living. Could it be that the Nazis of the 20th century were areincarnation of these misguided minds I have been describing? The parallels inbehaviour patterns and attitudes are clear to see, even in their treatment ofthe Jews. I believe that the programming by the Church of the collectiveconscious mind was so strong that when people later reincarnated they droppedback into the same thought patterns that had been programmed into them inprevious incarnations. This applies to the Church, economics, and all aspects ofour lives, and I have no doubt the same is happening today. In incarnation afterincarnation people drop back into old patterns they cannot or choose not tobreak. It is like the needle stuck in a record groove, although I must say I dofeel that some of the architects of Church dogma were, as with the Nazi leaders,incarnations of the Luciferic consciousness.I don’t recognise the term heresy. It is, for me, the ultimate arrogance tosuggest that certain beliefs must be free from questioning and challenge underthe guise of ‘heresy’ or ‘blasphemy’. But if you use for a moment the Church’sdefinition of heresy – the abuse and misrepresentation of the one they callJesus – then the greatest of all heresies has been Christianity itself.The Christian thought-police were now established across their domain and theywould soon spread their darkness to the Americas. The only threat to theirdomination of the Holy Land and beyond was another version of religiousindoctrination which answered to the name of Islam. The clashes between the twowould create yet more conflict, pain, and suffering – exactly what theBrotherhood and its master, Lucifer, wanted to see."},{"pageContent":"6Arabian KnightsIN the year 570 a child was born in the Arabian desert at Mecca. Forty yearslater he was to have a psychic experience that would affect the course ofhistory to the present day. His name was Mahomet or as he is better known,Mohammed.Again we have a psychic vision, a communication from another frequency, or anextra-terrestrial hologram, being mistaken for God or a messenger from God, andagain it was to have appalling consequences. Mahomet said that his communicatorhad told him the people of Arabia must return to a simple faith in Allah, theGod of Abraham (Allah = El and later Jehovah to the Hebrews). He said God hadalso chosen him to pass on this message, and those who accepted it would besaved on Judgment Day. Sound familiar? All of these apparently opposingreligions were started by the same non-physical manipulator – Lucifer in hismany forms. Mahomet was just another victim. He wrote down his communications ina book called the Koran (meaning recitation), and from that came the religion weknow as Islam (meaning submission to God) and the people called Muslims orMoslems (one who submits). Terrible violence became the means of advancingMahomet’s cause. He changed in character from what would appear to have been akind and loving man into a tyrant as his religious beliefs and a highly negativeenergy took him over. So what caused this sudden change? It could have been thathe simply became power hungry, I suppose, but maybe there is anotherexplanation. I do not offer it as fact, just a possibility.Mahomet says that he saw his vision near the cave where he would often go. Thevision apparently claimed to be the angel Gabriel of biblical fame and he lostconsciousness during the encounter. Other prophet figures have told of similarexperiences. When he woke up the message he was told to recite was, he says,inscribed upon his heart. Perhaps it would have been more accurate to say hismind. To appreciate what could have happened to Mahomet, St Paul, Augustine, andendless others, we need to make the division in our minds between the stage ofevolution humanity had reached at the time and where the ETs were in theirknowledge and technology. In the modern world, highly sophisticated,mind-control techniques are well known to the secret Brotherhood elite today andthe intelligence agencies who work to an agenda which ignores democraticgovernment and scrutiny. But even these techniques are primitive compared withwhat the ETs can do and, more to the point, could do thousands of years agoacross the entire period covered in this book. They could turn certain peopleinto super-robots, controlled almost entirely through mind programming. The CIAtoday have the ability to abduct someone, implant a micro-chip in their brain,or so hypnotise them that another version of what happened can replace theactual experience in their memory. Look at the difference between that level ofknowledge and the stage of understanding humans had reached in the periods weare discussing and you can see how easy it would have been to control manyevents.I am not saying that this happened, I don’t know. But it would be naive todismiss the possibility out of hand, in the light of what we know aboutmind-controlling techniques today. Humans, rather than ETs, could well have beeninvolved in affecting Mahomet’s mind via the Brotherhood. There are, of course,other explanations for his experience. The most likely is some sort of psychichappening or manipulation, or even drugs. Maybe he was genuinely the subject ofefforts to pass on spiritual knowledge and his ego took over. Part of themessage he wrote down said: “Don’t use violence in religion,” only for this tobe removed from the Koran texts when he did just that. There is a great deal ofgood sense to be found in the Koran among all the dross. What precisely happenedto Mahomet, we can’t say, but one thing is for sure – what followed hisexperience was anything but spiritual.Even before Mahomet the town of Mecca was considered a religious centre andattracted thousands of pilgrims. It had a small temple called the Kaaba (Houseof God) and its cornerstone was a meteorite. This was held to be sacred and theplace of worship for the god Allah Taala and images of Jesus, Mary, and othersdecorated the walls. The Bedouins who owned the temple enjoyed a very profitablebusiness as the people paid to worship and kiss the sacred stone. They becamevery angry at the preachings of Mahomet because if his ideas caught on theyfeared their trade would cease. To their dismay he was gathering many followersand the town of Medina had asked him to be their ruler as the prophet of Allah.Given what has happened since, it is some irony to think that it was the Jews inMedina who helped to persuade people that he was who he claimed to be. TheBedouins of Mecca plotted to kill him, but he escaped with his close friend AbuBekr and hid in his cave before returning to the safety of Medina in 622. Medinatranslates as ‘town of the Prophet’.From his base in Medina he and his followers attacked and robbed the tradingcaravans on their way to Mecca and conflict came to this desert region.Mahomet’s growing power and arrogance led him to announce that God had told himthe people in Medina who would not accept his message should be killed. It wasChristianity revisited. All non-believers must die. Mahomet ordered manymassacres, including the murder of 900 Jews, and in the end a treaty was agreedbetween Mecca and Medina. Mecca would recognise Mahomet as the prophet of God ifhe moved the centre of the faith from Medina to Mecca. In this way the templewould lose one faith, but gain another, and although the pilgrims would now comefor different reasons, they would still come and keep the tills ticking over. Nodoubt with commercial benefits in mind, the Bedouins also insisted that Mahomettell the people to face Mecca and not Jerusalem when they prayed. This wouldincrease their desire to visit the place they were facing several times a day.Fourteen hundred years later Moslems across the world still face the directionof Mecca when they pray.Mahomet went to war with any community throughout Arabia who would not accepthis rule and his claims to be the prophet of God. This turned a region ofcommunities into a nation determined to spread their new creed throughout theworld by whatever means were necessary. I have to smile when I hear Moslemreligious leaders speaking on the radio, and every time they say the ‘TheProphet Mohammed’ they follow immediately with ‘peace and blessings upon him’. Iam all for peace and blessings on everyone, including those who Mahomet and hisfollowers murdered in the name of God and those still kept in mental andphysical bondage by Moslem fanatics today. Women particularly have suffered inthe Moslem world from the beliefs of Mahomet which have made them prisoners intheir own lands when the Koran is followed to the letter.With Mahomet’s death at the age of 62, his friend Abu Bekr took over as hisKalifa or Caliph which means successor. He was ruthless in pursuit of his desirefor world domination by Islam and the rivers of blood flowed across the MiddleEast. Every country was given the same ultimatum: accept the Caliph as theirruler and adopt the Moslem faith, or die by the sword.By the year 750, Moslem rule had advanced dramatically. It now controlledArabia, Egypt, the North African Coast, Armenia, Syria, Palestine, Persia,Mesopotamia, and Spain. This gave them control of the Christian ‘Mecca’ ofJerusalem and many other places the Christians believed to be sacred. In timeConstantinople, the first Christian city, would also fall. The Moslems were toadopt the crescent as their emblem, but this was originally designed by theChristians of Constantinople and only became associated with Islam after thecity was taken. The Moslem Empire would later extend to the Indian subcontinentwhere the deep and bitter hatred thus created between Moslems and Hindus stillcontinues. It is the old, old, familiar story. We have all the answers and ifyou don’t accept that, you are dead. One can only speculate at the mental agenecessary to think in such terms, or the power of the mental control someone orsomething has over them. When anyone tells you they have all the answers it istime to race for the exits.You will see through the story of religions that certain key themes are commonto them all. First someone channels a non-physical communicator or meets theoccupant of a spacecraft and takes them to be whatever version of God theirbelief system will accept. A fanatical zeal unfolds to impose these beliefs oneveryone else and as time goes on and the original instigator dies, feuds breakout over power, money, position, and ‘truth’. So it was with the Moslem Faith.Arguments began over who should be the Caliph in the centuries that followed. Aman called Othman was chosen on one occasion, but this was resented by Ali, thehusband of Mahomet’s daughter, Fatima. Ali believed he should have been Caliphbecause he was a member of the Prophet’s family and Othman was not. There wastremendous conflict between the two factions and it is still going on in someareas to this very day. The Shiite, or orthodox Moslems, believe they descendfrom those who said Ali should be caliph while the others, called Sunni Moslems,recognise Othman. God help us. At one time anyone who could claim to descendfrom Mahomet was executed and once again I’m sure the negative Brotherhoodorganisations were stimulating the division whenever they could.There were, and are, however, many good things about Moslem rule. This is animportant point which I want to stress most strongly. In all these books, likethe Bible and Koran, you will find among the incitements and justifications forhorrific behaviour some good and virtuous philosophies. The fanatics who, byforce, have largely been in control have picked out the former to guide theirlives, but others have had the sense and decency of spirit to be guided by thelatter. Not every believer in Christianity was a murdering barbarian and norevery Moslem. Across the world today there are hundreds of millions of faithfulChristians and Moslems who follow the positive messages in their religious booksand reject the violence. There are some wonderful human beings working withinthe Christian Church and, as I have found in Britain and in my travels throughthe Middle East, you will not find a kinder, more generous people than themoderate, thinking, Moslems. If they and the moderate Christians had been incontrol over the centuries then although they would still be following what are,in my view, religions based on myth, at least the slaughter fields would nothave been thought necessary.There were periods in the Moslem empire when the fanatics were not in controland these times made a vital contribution to humanity by preserving theknowledge of people like Plato and Aristotle. Under the caliph Haroun-al-Raschidin the late eighth, early ninth, century the capital was moved to Baghdad. Theirthought was not imprisoned by the Koran and although the caliph still sent hisarmies to pillage and murder appallingly in neighbouring lands, he also set upschools and colleges. Scientists, doctors, and philosophers travelled to thiscentre of intellectual freedom. Baghdad became the world’s wealthiest city withmany hospitals, more than 600 doctors and 6,000 students. All religions wereallowed to be followed freely. When Al-Mamun took over from his father, theGreek, Persian and Chaldean literature which had survived the Christian priestswas translated into Arabic. He openly questioned the teachings of the Koran andencouraged philosophy. In this period great advances were made in theunderstanding of science and healing and an extensive system of schools wascreated for children. The Moslem world was light years ahead of Christendomwhere all these things, including healing, were banned on pain of death. InSouthern Spain under Moslem rule it was the same as in Baghdad. Their way ofthinking and living was in a different world to the squalor and ignorance whichprevailed throughout Christendom. We have much to thank the Moslems for underthese more open-minded rulers. They kept the flame of knowledge alive and itpaved the way for the Renaissance in Europe.The glories of Baghdad as a home of knowledge and mental freedom were crushedwhen the Turks invaded in the 11th century. These were orthodox, fanatical,Moslems and intolerance and ignorance returned. I say orthodox, fanatical,Moslems, but the division of attitude should really be broken down into fanaticsand thinkers. The Moslem fanatics had the same mentality as the Christianfanatics and, had each been born in the other’s land, they would have beenequally fanatical about the other’s religion. We speak of Moslems andChristians, but it’s not like that in reality. It is fanatics and thinkers. Thereligions are simply used as a vehicle for fanaticism. If they did not exist,they would find another expression for their mental and emotional imbalances. Inthe same way, if the moderate, thinking, people did not have a religion throughwhich to express their spirituality, they would find another vehicle for it.The Turks went on to create the Ottoman Empire, a name which came from Osman,one of their rulers. Its expansion into hitherto Christian lands was helped bythe latest arguments over the trinity. Now they were falling out over the Latinword Filioque, which means ‘and from the Son’. Did the Holy Ghost proceed onlyfrom the Father or from the Father ‘and from the Son’? Does anyone care?Unfortunately they do, and when the Filioque was added to the creed by the Popein 1054 it split the Western and Eastern Churches. This Eastern Church is nowknown as the Greek or Eastern Orthodox. There was a definite Brotherhood ploy tonow split the Christian religion into factions of conflict. While Christendomwas arguing about all this, the Moslem Turks were taking advantage and expandingtheir empire into Christian strongholds. The Pope sought to bring unity ofpurpose by launching a crusade against the Moslems to win back control of theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre from the ‘infidels’. There were eight crusades inall and Jerusalem was won and then lost again. The urgency to regain the HolyCity was increased by the belief that the Second Coming would happen soon. Infact the idea of the Saviour-god returning goes back to the days of Sun worshipand is common to many religions. Most of the crusades were a disaster and on oneoccasion the Church organised an army made up of children from France andGermany in an effort to re-take Jerusalem. This ‘Children’s Crusade’ waslaunched during the Papacy of Innocent III. Few of the children returned. Mostwere victims of disease, accident, murder, and slavery.The Crusades were responsible for the most staggering violence and the ‘Knightsof Chivalry’ were no more than barbarous killing machines. The European kingsand knights were urged by the Church and the Brotherhood societies to kill forGod. Two branches of the Brotherhood most active at this time were the KnightsTemplar (or Knights of the Temple) and the Knights Hospitaler. The latter wasprobably not under Brotherhood Control from its creation in 1048. It was then acharitable order, but in 1118 it had another incarnation as the Order of KnightsHospitaler of St John. This came after a change of leadership and motivation.They became a military organisation named after John, the son of the King ofCyprus, who fought in the Crusades. It would seem to have been a Brotherhoodtakeover and the Order began to operate with a Grand Master and all the rituals,secret initiations, rituals, and symbols, which go back to ancient times. TheKnights Templar were a Brotherhood branch from the start, with their GrandMaster and customary secrecy. They came into being a year after the Hospitalersjoined the Brotherhood and the Templars were to have enormous power behind thescenes. Like the Hospitalers they were given large amounts of money bysupporters of the Crusades and the Templars became so rich they began thefinancial centres in Paris and London by storing their wealth in their templesin those cities. The Teutonic (German) Knights were another charitable order whochanged to a military role. They had a Grand Master and all the trimmings andthese three Brotherhood branches hated each other, much to the delight of thosewho were controlling them without their knowledge. Again I am not saying thatevery member of these groups was knowingly working against the people. Mostwould have had the best of intentions. The Brotherhood doesn’t work like that.It needs to hoodwink most of its own to be most effective. The Brotherhood ismanipulation with a smile on its face and it seeks a good public image. For thatit needs some good people involved at the lower levels. Charitable trusts andcharity work in general is often a front it chooses to use.Even on the journeys to the ‘Holy Land’ by the Christian Crusaders othernon-believers on route were tortured and murdered. The Jews suffered most. TheChristians condemned the whole Jewish Race as the ‘murderers of Christ’ and anyscale of barbarity against them could be justified by that. When the crusadersof the Lord re-took Jerusalem one of their first acts was to burn the synagoguewith the Jews still inside. The streets literally ran with the blood of theirJewish and Moslem victims, a great contrast to the way some Moslem leaderstreated the Christians when Islam regained the city. In the end the crusadesachieved nothing, except for sending hundreds of thousands to an early grave andcausing terrible pain and destruction – exactly what the Brotherhood wanted. Itwas not until this century that the Christian world had control of the Holy Landagain, when it became part of the British Empire. The Jews suffered in Europefor another reason. The Christian religion in this period imposed a strict banon usury, the charging of interest on loans. An usurer could have all hisproperty confiscated, be excommunicated, and refused a Christian burial. It wasconsidered better that a wife should leave an usurer husband and beg for food,than to accept anything from him. The Jews were not subject to this Christianlaw and they did charge interest on lending. This made them extremely unpopularwith people in debt. In 1290, 16,000 Jews were deported from England because ofthis by Edward 1st.At the end of the Crusades and the Moslem victory, the Brotherhood knights hadto flee. The Order of St John did well, as it moved around, changing its namewith its location as the Knights of Rhodes and Knights of Malta. They havesurvived to this day as the Sovereign and Military Order of Malta, which, withpapal help, moved its base to Rome and became the world’s smallest nation. TheKnights of Malta have tremendous influence in politics and in the secretsocieties today. The Templars have also survived, but the reprisals against themfor losing the crusades, and the charges aimed against them for spitting on thecross and homosexuality saw their wealth and power taken away. For a while,anyway.The reasons for this campaign against them were greed and the preservation ofthe con-trick called Christianity. The Templars accumulated breathtaking richesas Christians gave their wealth to them in their wills and donations. TheTemplars were the richest organisation in every country in which theyestablished themselves. They became bankers without charging interest because ofthe Christian Church’s ban on usury. When the Jews were expelled from France in1306 for their usury activities, Philip, the French King, had to re-pay hisdebts to them. This he did by giving them virtually all his country’s reservesof coinage in exchange for all the property they left behind. King Philip wasdesperate for money to meet foreign commitments and he decided to steal theTemplar gold. Philip and his fellow Frenchman, Pope Clement V, hatched a plan toachieve it. Allegations were made against the Templars and Clement charged themwith heresy. Their money went to Philip and their lands to the church. TheTemplar’s Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake.But there was another reason why the Church was so keen on destroying theTemplars and the Cathars. In 1891 during restoration of the village church atRennes-le-Château in South-West France, the parish priest, Berenger Saunière,found four parchments. They were sealed in wooden tubes which had been hiddeninside a hollow altar pillar. Two of these contained the blood lines of localfamilies and dated back to 1244 and 1644. Saunière also discovered a secret codein the texts and he told the Bishop of Carcassonne what he had found. With thatthe parish priest was summoned to Paris to meet the church hierarchy and showthem the parchments.From that time, Saunière was a man transformed. He would have earned a verysmall income as a priest, but in the years that followed he spent millions onpaintings, antiques and rare china. He also built a mansion which he never livedin and a tower so close to the side of a mountain that it overlooked nothing.His behaviour became very strange in all sorts of ways. When a new Bishop ofCarcassonne was appointed and complained at Saunière’s antics, the parish priestwas supported by the Pope himself. Saunière died of ‘a stroke’ in 1917 at theage of sixty-five. But it seems that his coffin had been ordered by hishousekeeper five days before his ‘stroke’, when he had seemed perfectly healthy.A priest who came to give him the last rites and heard his confession was saidto have left the room visibly shaken and never to have smiled again.So what did Saunière know?In 1969, Henry Lincoln, a British scriptwriter, became interested in the storyand he uncovered documents at the National Library in France kept under thetitle of ‘Dossiers Secrets’. One mentioned a secret order structured on typicalBrotherhood lines called the Priory of Sion which had also been named in theparchments found by Saunière in Rennes-le-Château. Lincoln’s document said thatpast Grand Masters of this order included Leonardo da Vinci, the scientist IsaacNewton, the alchemist, Nicholas Flamel, and the composer, Claude Debussy. Theplot thickened because Saunière had met Debussy when he was summoned to Paris bythe Church hierarchy. The Priory of Sion, the document went on, was the innerhierarchy of the Knights Templar which were dedicated to restoring theMerovingians to the French Throne. The Merovingian dynasty began in the 5thcentury. Mérovée became Frankish King in 448 and the family were said to haveroyal or holy blood. The Templars had a stronghold at Bezu not far fromRennes-le-Château, and remember, the parchments found by Saunière includedfamily blood lines.This becomes extremely relevant and links in perfectly with my earlierconclusions about the Jesus story when you consider the following. HenryLincoln’s work was the subject of three television documentaries in 1972 and asa result he received a letter from a retired Anglican priest. The letter saidthat the writer knew for certain that what Saunière found was uncontestableproof that Jesus did not die on the cross. The priest said that he was giventhis information by a fellow Anglican cleric who had worked in Paris with EmileHoffet. When Saunière was ordered to Paris, one of those who interviewed him wasEmile Hoffet. Lincoln’s informant said the parchments proved that Jesus wasalive in France at least until 45AD. As I suggested earlier, Jesus travelled tothe Rennes-le-Château area with Mary Magdalene and their children after he hadrecovered from the crucifixion. He may have died there or possibly he could haveended his life in Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier. I believe the Roman CatholicChurch know that Jesus did not die on the cross and have done so for at least1500 years. They have suppressed this knowledge to protect their own power. Theyhave conned billions of people over the centuries and continue to do so today.The proof of this is locked up in the Vatican vaults and, as Saunière possiblyfound out, they will pay any sort of price to persist with this monumental lie.They will also commit genocide to preserve their deceit. King Philip may havehad money as his motivation to destroy the Knights Templar after the failedCrusades, but Pope Clement V had other reasons for his own involvement. TheTemplars knew the true story of Jesus, just as the Cathars had done when theyemerged in the same region of France which includes Rennes-le-Château. TheCathars had also denied that Jesus died on the cross and they were eliminatedfor that reason more than any other. I feel the much talked-about Cathar‘treasure’ was the proof that Jesus survived the cross. This story goes on tothis day because the Brotherhood elite is still determined to crown a ‘WorldKing’ who descends from the bloodline of Jesus, something they inherited via theTemplars, who believed that the Merovingians decended from the blood line ofKing David, through Jesus and his children. This is why they were so keen to putthe Merovingians back on the French throne, and this was another incentive forKing Philip to be rid of them. It was thought the Merovingian blood line haddied out after they lost the Frankish throne in the 8th century, but the Catharsand the Templars knew differently. Today, somewhere in the world, theBrotherhood, or some elements of it, are possibly preparing a person who theyclaim to be from the David, Jesus, Merovingian, blood line to become ‘WorldKing’.Everything and everyone is expendable to those who control the Brotherhood oncetheir use to them has run its course. There is no better example of that thanthe way the Brotherhood was manipulating its Christian branches to fight theMoslems, while doing the same to its Moslem branches to fight the Christians.Among these Moslem Brotherhood groups were the Karmathites, the Druses, theBrotherhood of the Nine, and the Assassins. At the heart of the secret societiesof the Moslem world was the Grand Lodge of Cairo from where many Brotherhoodgroups in Europe originated. As with all religions the original structure breaksup into factions, as with the Shiites. Out of the Shiites came another factioncalled the Ismaili Sect, a Brotherhood Branch with the Aga Khan as its‘spiritual leader’ today, and out of that came yet another arm of theBrotherhood, the Assassins – Grand Master, secret initiations, you know thescore. The word Assassin means a user of hashish because they used the drug tostimulate their mystical experiences and for other more sinister reasons. Nowassassin means something very different – a lone killer. This is because theAssassins used this method very effectively to expand their power from theirbase in Iran. They were not choosy. They killed Moslem and Christian alike.The Assassins became a model for the political and economic murders of today.They would not do the killing themselves, they would mind control a young manand get him to do it. Their preferred method was to introduce him to the GrandMaster. He would then be drugged with hashish and lose consciousness. When heawoke he would be in a beautiful garden and there he would be pampered and ledto believe he was in heaven, paradise. He would be given more of the drug, loseconsciousness again, and wake up back with the Grand Master. The killer-to-bewould be told that he had never left the Grand Master’s presence and that he hadbeen given a taste of the eternal paradise that would await him if he did as hewas told by the Assassins and killed for God. They invariably did. Couldsomething along these lines have happened to Mahomet centuries earlier?This same basic technique, but now far more sophisticated, is used today tomurder those who get in the way of the Brotherhood’s plan for world domination.This method of mind controlling outsiders to do your dirty work makes it almostimpossible to identify the real killers, especially when those investigating thecrime are also Brotherhood members, more often than not. The Moslem secretsocieties indoctrinated and conned their initiates in ways that also mirroredthe other branches of the Brotherhood, like the freemasons. The lower degrees ofinitiation were quite straightforward and appeared to support the status quo,the Moslem religion in their case. But then, at a certain level when theinitiate was well entrenched in the society, the whole story was switched andsuddenly they were told to forget all they had been told before. The new versionof the ‘truth’, which itself would undergo other changes at the higher levels ofinitiation, would lead to the revelation of who or what the society was reallyserving. Only if it was believed beyond doubt that you could be trusted tosupport the ‘Great Work’ would you be given this knowledge. This is how the fewcan use the majority of their members as a front of respectability for theirclandestine activities against freedom. If you are a freemason or a member ofany secret society, you are almost certainly being conned, and it is time yourealised that. Get out while you can. The Assassins, by the way, were overrun bythe invading Mongols under the leadership of Mangu Khan in 1250, but theirattitude to life very much lives on.As Islam extended its influence with great speed, it added to the host ofreligions vying for power and recognition in the Middle and Near East –Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Hinduism….If you felt the need to hand over your mind to an ‘ism’, you were spoilt forchoice, although choice was hardly the word in most cases. You were what youwere told to be most of the time.Europe was in chaos and turmoil after the Romans left, but over the centuriescertain tribes gained dominance and countries began to emerge. A Frankish tribetook over the lands we now call France and a branch of this settled in whatbecame Germany. In Britain, they were ruled by a series of invaders, among themthe Vikings, Saxons and the Normans. Theirs was also a story of imposition,invasion, political and religious conflict, and constant Brotherhood activity. Atitle was never so apt than the Dark Ages. It encapsulates the whole motivationand experience of the time, but slowly the power of the Roman Church was to bebroken and Britain would be at the forefront of this momentous event. It wasnot, however, quite the blow for freedom that it might at first have appeared tobe."},{"pageContent":"7The Cracks AppearCHRISTIANITY loves to portray itself as the force that civilised the world. Aswe have seen, nothing could be further from the truth. It sought to crush allefforts to bring civilisation to the Dark Ages it had created.Part of its propaganda is to lump all pre-Christians together as ‘pagans’ andtherefore heathens and savages. This is another abuse of truth. Yes, there werepeople in the pre-Christian world who behaved in terrible ways, but none was anyworse than those who imposed Christianity. And to say that all pre-Christianswere ‘heathens’ is supreme arrogance. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras,Hippocrates, Quintilian, were heathens? The very thought is hysterical.You simply cannot divide generations and civilisations into heathen andenlightened, or good and bad. Within all civilisations, no matter how negativetheir overall effect, are positive people trying to do what their heart istelling them. During the worst excesses of Christianity there were manycompassionate people who followed the creed, and it was the same with Islam andother religions. So it has been throughout human history. We look back on thosewho peopled the Earth in the thousands of years before Christianity and believethem to be stupid savages; yet the understanding of life and creation among manyof their number was more advanced than the modern world in many ways.Their most enlightened members, often incarnations of the volunteerconsciousness supported by channelled information, knew that the Earth was alivewith a mind of her own. They knew of the energy system and the sacred points.The ancient Chinese applied this knowledge to the human body in what has becomeknown as acupuncture. The ancients built the stone circles and erected standingstones on the chakras and acupuncture points of the Earth. Many of them have aneffect similar to acupuncture needles. These great structures, like Stonehengein England, are said to be the cultish monuments of a backward people, and yetwhat they put into place is still at work today helping to keep the batteredenergy grid in some kind of order. They were excellent channellers because theywere not subjected to the tidal wave of abuse, derision, and condemnation fromtheir society when their psychic gifts were activated as children. Their parentsdid not say ‘Don’t be silly’, when they saw visions of entities on otherfrequencies or heard their communications; so they did not shut down thesechannels through fear and confusion. Naturally they were subjected tomanipulation and I’m sure that some of the standing stones and circles were putthere for negative reasons, too, to disrupt the energy flows or even toconcentrate the energies at certain points to allow the spacecraft to use thepower for their activities. Not every stone circle is positive, but overallthese ancient peoples had some idea of the Earth as a living, breathing, entity.I feel that the land we now call the British Isles was part of Atlantis beforethe series of cataclysms began to disconnect this land from the island thatAtlantis was to become. Britain has always been recognised as an area ofenormous importance to the grid. Despite the efforts of people like Boadicea,the Britons could not hold out against the Roman invasion. Although JuliusCaesar’s attempted invasion was eventually repelled, the Roman Empire absorbedmost of Britain a few years later after the year 43. They never did succeed insuppressing most of the people of Scotland and a wall would be built by theEmperor Hadrian to keep them out. Christianity would later do what the Romanscould not do – take control of all Scotland. The rule of the Romans had manybenefits. The inter-tribal wars diminished and roads were built to improvecommunications.After the fall of the Roman Empire in 410 the islands of Britain were invaded bytribes from the regions we know as Germany and Denmark. The inter-breeding ofthe indigenous population and the invaders created the Anglo-Saxon race. It wasin these Anglo-Saxon times that the process of losing the ancient knowledgereally began to accelerate. The country was broken up into the kingdoms ofNorthumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. They foughtover….…. yes, you’ve got it….….religion. The supporters of the Nicene Creedfought with those who supported the Arius view of Jesus, while the pagans foughtwith both of them. Oswy, the Christian king of Northumbria, ‘did a Constantine’in 664, when he called the two Christian factions together at Whitby; afterhearing the arguments he decided that all England would follow the Pope and theNicene Creed. The foundations were now set for the Church to rule the country.The rule of the Roman emperor had been replaced by the rule of the Roman pope,so it was throughout the former Roman Empire. Now the manipulators only had tocontrol the papacy and they controlled most of the known world.As the very mention of the so-called pagan knowledge became the equivalent ofsuicide in the Christian world, the information about energies and energy siteswas passed on in legends by those who wished to preserve the basic truths. Theytalked in codes about giants and sacred hills and wells, and the ‘giants’ couldeven have some extra-terrestrial background, too. These stories can still befound in local folklore today, and because they are taken literally theoriginators are looked upon as backward people. When you decode the symbolismyou can see that they were far from backward. They were merely trying to pass onknowledge in ways that would not get them executed by those who were backward –the representatives of the Christian religion.There was conflict all over Europe, with village fighting village at any excuse,and the culture brought by the Romans was largely destroyed. The chaosthroughout the former Roman Empire developed into a form of control calledfeudalism, which was to create the social structure on which Europe developedfor centuries to come. Groups of weaker people would gather behind a strongpersonality (not necessarily an enlightened one by any means), and all whofollowed him and did whatever he asked were given his protection. The divisionhad arrived between the freeman and the bondsman, those who were no more thanslaves. The leaders would become known as the lord or the king and they wereconsidered to be the representatives of God. The noblemen were the upperclasses. Christianity was one of the main instigators and supporters of thissystem which turned most people into the slaves of the few and it was the sameacross Europe. The kings and noblemen took over the land, and gave great wealthto the Church in their misguided belief, encouraged by the Church, that theywere buying a place in heaven. The feudal manor or the monastery was now theauthority which the communities of serfs had to obey. In time Britain wasdivided into shires ruled by ealdormen (later known as earls), and under themwere the thegns (later barons). These, along with the most powerful priests,became the nobility. It is from these beginnings and the creation of slaves thatthe class system emerged which is still with us today, with its landed gentry,nobility, Church and clergy, separated from the mass of the people by eitherwealth or privilege, often both.All this was dreamland for the negative Brotherhood sects. What a perfect systemto manipulate, playing one against the other to create conflict and upheaval,using this to change the world in your image. These kingdoms and communitieswould fight and battle with each other until one or a few would become dominantand take over large areas of land which would develop into a country. Wessexbecame dominant in England when it defeated the Mercians in 825 and King Egbertof Wessex controlled all of England. He was, in effect if not name, the firstEnglish king. Ethelwulf followed, and then came Alfred the Great. He was by farthe most enlightened ruler of his time encouraging, among other things, thetranslation of Latin literature into English. Through it all the Churchprospered. Kingdoms and nobles may come and go, but the Church was always there,adding with every dying king and noble to its now breathtaking fortune of landand riches. Christianity was now in control of England, and so was theBrotherhood.This control would strengthen even further after the Battle of Hastings in 1066.Harold, the English King, was faced with invasions from the Danes and theNormans. He defeated the Danes at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York andmarched his troops south to tackle William, Duke of Normandy, a ruthless man whowas very close to Pope Alexander II. The Pope, William, and Brotherhoodsocieties plotted the invasion of England and the Papacy supplied the funds.William believed he was doing it for God and he carried the Pope’s banners intobattle, just as the pagan armies had carried images of their gods into the fray.Nothing had changed except the emblem. William defeated the English army andbecame king. Now the Pope would have a subservient England along with France andGermany. French became the language of England and this gradually fused with thevarious other languages spoken on the islands, Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Latin, andDanish, to create the English tongue we recognise today.William ordered the production of the Doomsday Book which recorded the ownershipof every house, animal, and acre of land for taxation purposes and he gave greatareas of England to the Church to pay back the Pope for his support of theinvasion. Lanfranc, an Italian Prior, was brought over from his abbey inNormandy to be made Archbishop of Canterbury and administer the Church’s landand other wealth. It was he who organised a system of tithes to be paid to theChurch by every landowner in the country. Even the poorest were not exempt andthey paid up in their ignorance and fear that the priests could consign them tohell forever more. To this day the landowners of England still have to pay thistithe to the Church, even if they think that Christianity is a load of baloney.Opposition in the 1930s would change the nature of the payment, but it is stillpaid in another way. In 1936 the tithes were replaced by a fixed annual paymentto be charged until October 1996. These fees are to pay for the three per centof Government stock handed over to the Church authorities in exchange for theirconceding their right to the tithes. This means, of course, that we are allpaying for the Church in the costs added by the landowners to the price of theirproduce. All this because the priests frightened people through violence or helland damnation into handing over their lands during a period of nearly a thousandyears.Through all this period of English and world history and in the followingcenturies, enlightened and courageous people were trying to raise the level ofconsciousness and knowledge. It is difficult to pick out which of them weregenuinely seeking freedom for the people and which were working to a Brotherhoodagenda, undermining religion in the longer term to bring about a world thataccepted only the physical level of being. I think at least the great majorityhad good intent, and if they were playing the Brotherhood’s game, it wasprobably mostly by ignorance, not malice. Roger Bacon, an English Franciscanfriar of the 13th century wrote that people should cease to be ruled by dogmaand authority and think for themselves. He had an advanced understanding for histime of science and he was confined by the Church because of his views. Othersfollowed and their numbers grew until it exploded into the period called theRenaissance or ‘new birth’. The key to what followed was the coming of theprinting press to Europe. The means to make paper had been discovered by theChinese, taken on by the Moslems and, through them, reached the Italians. Theidea of printing with movable type also goes back to China and in the 1470sWilliam Caxton was setting up his printing press in Westminster and producingthe first book by this method in England. Caxton translated books from Frenchand Latin into English and the exchange of knowledge began to flow all overEurope, although the Church would seek to suppress this at every turn.The Renaissance in art, literature, and knowledge began chiefly in Italy fromits stronghold in Florence. Greeks were seeking refuge in Italy from the Turksand they brought with them their knowledge, language and books. The learning ofthe Greek language had been banned by the Roman Catholic Church to stop peoplereading the works of the Greek philosophers, but now the ban was being ignoredby those thirsting for knowledge. The spread of Greek literature reachedEngland, France, and Germany. When the Turks took Constantinople there was anexodus of Greeks to Italy with yet more books, manuscripts, and knowledge. Theworks of the Moslem scientists and the knowledge gathered at the time of theopen-minded rulers in Baghdad found its way to Italy and Europe.The volunteer consciousness and the other levels were doing all they could tobring about the breakthrough in knowledge that would undermine the power of theChurch. Vittorino da Feltre pioneered a new educational system in Italy whichoffered his students all the knowledge available, not only that which the Churchwished to impose. The obvious corruption, vice, and violence of the Church wasreducing its authority and then came the Great Schism when there were two popes,one ruling from Rome and the other from Avignon. This came about because theItalian Church believed that only an Italian should be pope and for thirty-eightyears there were two popes, each with their own army plundering and pillagingwherever they went.The discovery of America reduced Italy’s importance as a trading centre andplaces like Venice and Genoa diminished in their wealth and power. The povertythis brought to Italy dimmed the fires of change and slowly the Church reimposedits grip, especially after Christian Spain occupied Northern Italy in 1538. TheChurch compiled an index on all banned literature which comprised, of course, ofeverything that challenged its doctrines. The Inquisition increased its workrate. But, much as the Roman Church tried to close the door again on knowledge,changes were now inevitable. There had been growing discontent with the excessesof the papacy and the priests. The papacy went to the highest bidder. The postgave the occupant control of incredible wealth and real estate. Kings bowed tothe power of Rome and the inquisition secured the submission of the masses. TheChurch also supported the feudal system of masters and serfs. The reactionagainst all this had been a long time coming. The pressure for change hadgathered slowly, and then more quickly through these centuries of fear andsubservience. The bubonic plague called the Black Death was dramatically toreduce the population of the world, and in Europe alone about a quarter of thepopulation died. I have seen it speculated that the Black Death and otherplagues might have been created by a version of extra-terrestrial germ warfare.Certainly it would seem that bright lights in the sky and foul-smelling mistswere reported quite often before the plague struck a community. Reports of‘comets’ at that time could easily have been spacecraft, and historians havewritten of comets trailing behind them gases that killed trees and the landsfertility. We now often symbolise death with a picture of a skeleton holding ascythe; this comes from the numerous reports across Europe of strange men inblack holding ‘scythes’ who appeared in a town or village before people fell illwith the Black Death. What were these ‘scythes’? Whatever the cause of theplague, it did have a long-term impact in changing the status quo.There were now fewer people to do the work of their masters and their dependenceon the serfs who were available increased. The supply and demand of labour hadtilted towards the serfs and the downtrodden began to protest against theirconditions. Sometimes their leaders were assassinated, but the protestscontinued and there were peasant revolts in many countries, which broughtconflict, upheaval, pain and suffering. The centuries of blind and massobedience to the Church and its masters were being questioned during this periodfrom the 14th to 17th centuries. Events and the growth of knowledge werebeginning the process of liberation from Church control, a process that is onlyreaching fruition today in what you might call the Spiritual Renaissance or theLight Age.The Church was an obvious target for change and courageous people stood up andchallenged it. John Wycliffe condemned the behaviour of the priests who wereusing information gathered at confessions to blackmail people; some priests wereselling forgiveness of sin for money or possessions. Wycliffe advocated that thescriptures were the only foundation of religious knowledge and that the pope wasnot the head of the Church. He dismissed the idea of transubstantiation – thebelief that bread and wine can be converted into the body and blood of Christduring the Eucharist ceremony. He had the Bible translated into English and sentout supporters to expound his views. The priests would later persuade Henry IVto authorise the burning of all heretics, including Wycliffe’s supporters. Bythen he had died, but the priests had his bones exhumed from a churchyard inLutterworth, Leicestershire, where he had been had been parish priest. They didnot want his skeleton polluting holy ground. The more Rome sought to dealviolently with protesters, the more protests they had to deal with.The coming of the printing press brought the translation and distribution of theBible to a much wider audience. Up until then, the masses had only the word ofthe priests to tell them what the Bible said and meant. But as it was made morewidely available people began to see the difference between the simple lives ofthe Bible ‘heroes’ and the opulent lifestyles of the clergy who were taking tenper cent of all the wealth the people produced. They could begin to re-interpretthe texts for themselves. The Church knew the consequences of this and amongtheir desperate efforts to suppress knowledge of the Bible’s true content wasthe murder by burning at the stake, of William Tyndale. His heresy had been tobegin to translate the New Testament into English. When people did have theopportunity to read the Bible there was a desire for a return to the simplicityof the Scriptures and the Protestant movement began. This brought about theReformation when the Protestants broke away from the Catholic Church.Martin Luther was one of the early Protestant leaders. He lived in Germany,which was then composed of over three hundred states. In 1517, this professor oftheology at Wittenberg University pinned up a piece of paper containingninety-five complaints against the behaviour of Rome in its efforts to raisemoney to build the church of St Peter’s, on what had been the site of a pagantemple. The new church was, itself, built to make money in much the same way asthe bedouins of Mecca fleeced the pilgrims. This attitude continues in theVatican City today.Pope Julius II and his successor Leo X sanctioned a plan to sell divine pardonsfor money. For each donation they promised to release from purgatory the soul ofa dead relative or friend. As late as the second World War this practicesurvived, with the Catholic Archbishop of Winnipeg telling the wives and parentsof Canadian soldiers that, if their loved ones died in action, he would ensure,for a charge of $40, that they went immediately to their Maker and stayed withhim for all eternity.The revolt against Rome grew in Germany, and in 1520, Luther burned the decreeexcommunicating him, along with copies of the Canon Law, the name for theTheodosian Creed which updated the Nicaean Creed. The Lutheran Church was bornand many of the peasants supported Luther in the hope that religious changewould bring social reform. They backed the wrong man, for he was as much atyrant as most of the popes and he would later support terrible atrocitiesagainst the peasant peoples who wanted only freedom from tyranny. As he oncewrote:“Damned be love into the abyss of hell, if it is maintained to the damage offaith……It is better that tyrants should sin a hundred times against the peoplethan the people should sin once against the tyrants….the ass wants to bethrashed, the mob to be governed by force.”His hatred of reason and open-minded research was equally extreme. In one sermonhe said that his followers should throw spit in the face of reason, because shewas the Devil’s whore, rotten with the itch of leprosy, and ought to be kept inthe toilet. Nice man. He may have complained about papal and clericalindulgences, but like the other Protestants, he still believed the nonsensewhich Jerome and others had edited into the Bible and all the other inaccuraciesthat had been in the texts to start with. Other forms of Protestantinterpretation of the Bible followed such as Calvinism, the product of theFrenchmen John Calvin. He was as much a dictator as Luther and the Popes.Religion – and the Brotherhood – seem to breed such people. Calvin’s obnoxiouscreed was to have severe consequences in England and America because it was amajor influence on the beliefs of the Puritans, of which more later. Calvin,like Luther, promoted the idea that you could not ensure eternal salvation bythe way you lived your life or by ‘good works’. It could only come by faith inJesus as your Saviour. Even the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t quite that extreme,but Calvin went even further. He said that whether we were to be ‘saved’ or notwas decided by God before we were born! He called this idea predestination. Thechosen few who were selected by God for eternal salvation had a duty, he said,to suppress the sin of the condemned masses. It was, in other words, a licencefor untold slaughter.Protestantism broke into endless creeds, sects, and churches with differentbeliefs arguing on the vital issues for the future of humankind like the natureof the Trinity and whether Jesus entered the bread and wine consumed during theEucharist. This comes from a quote attributed to Jesus in the Bible which was,in fact, an addition by one of the many forgers and relates to a pagan belief:“And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, andgave it to the disciples, and said, ‘Take, eat, this is my body’. And he tookthe cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink ye all of it. Forthis is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remissionof sins’.”Over the interpretation of this forgery whole wars were fought. The ProtestantMovement came to England in a rather unusual way. Henry VIII wanted a son andheir, but his first wife Catherine of Aragon could only bear him a daughter,Mary. He decided to divorce her and asked Pope Clement VII to sanction it. Herefused. Henry was a committed Catholic and had condemned the Protestants inEurope to such an extent that the Pope had awarded him the title Defender of theFaith which British monarchs still hold to this day. This is ironic, becausetoday they are Protestant monarchs defending that faith under a title given by aRoman Catholic pope for defending his faith! You’ve got to chuckle, really.Henry was such a defender of the Catholic faith he ordered that all who deniedit were to be burned at the stake. But the opposition to his divorce changed allthat. He insisted that his parliament vote into being a Church of Englandindependent of Rome, and he made himself the head of the English Church. Whenthat was done the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, sanctioned hisdivorce from Catherine. Cranmer replaced Cardinal Wolsey as England’s mostinfluential churchman, because Wolsey had failed to secure his divorce. He wassummoned to London to be tried for treason, but died on the way at LeicesterAbbey.Wolsey had ruled the English Church like a dictator and had, to a large extent,run the country. The monasteries had enormous power and were home to the papalgarrison. They also owned great areas of England. They used the tried andtrusted methods like the fear of hell to persuade the wealthy to leave themtheir land and possessions. When that didn’t work they found some excuse to takethem. In their early days, the monasteries had made a positive contribution whencompared with the murder and misery in other areas of Christendom, but now theywere just as bad. Henry had long coveted their wealth and he took hisopportunity to abolish them and take their possessions. He was so short of moneythat he had to sell much of the land he acquired and this was the start of theperiod of the country squire and gentry. These were the wealthy men who boughtthe massive estates once owned, or rather stolen, by the Church, and they builtupon them their manor houses that became such a part of the English countryside.Henry waged war on anyone who refused to accept him as Supreme Head of theChurch, as outlined in the Act of Supremacy of 1534. His chancellor, Sir ThomasMore, was beheaded for such treason and there was a bloody purge on RomanCatholics. Henry married six women, two of which he executed. Only Jane Seymourbore him a son, who became Edward VI at the age of only nine when Henry died in1547. Edward was king in name only with the Protestant Duke of Somerset the realpower behind the throne. Edward himself died at 15 and he was succeeded by Mary,Henry’s daughter by Catherine of Aragon. She was a staunch Roman Catholic andbegan a bloody purge against Protestants which was so savage she was given thename ‘Bloody Mary’. Edward had been persuaded by the Duke of Somerset to leavethe throne to Henry’s great neice, Lady Jane Grey, who was a Protestantsupporter, but Mary had her executed and took the throne. Mary married Philip ofSpain who wished to have a peaceful relationship with England, so that his shipscould pass along the English Channel without hindrance. The Pope again becamehead of the Church of England. But another about-turn was imminent. With Mary’sdeath came Elizabeth I, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, who became queen at the ageof 25. Her mother had been a Protestant and she accepted that faith. The RomanCatholic Church opposed her succession because, it said, she was an illegitimatechild with her father’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon not recognised by thePope. She ignored them and restored the Protestant Church of England withherself as its Supreme Head. A bloody purge was launched against Catholics. TheQueen ordered the torture and death of so many Irish Catholics they gave her thetitle ‘Bloody Elizabeth’.All over Europe mass slaughter was being unleashed as Catholics and Protestantsfought against each other in civil and national wars. Which side was mostpersecuted depended on who had managed to seize the throne at the time. When youlook back at the scale of death and destruction committed in the name ofreligion, even basically the same religion, it is stunning beyond belief. Allbut a handful of wars have been caused by religion or the perceived superiorityof the ancestral line of one group or nation’s physical bodies, when in truththey are just temporary vehicles for our consciousness to experience this level.But let us take another angle on the events that followed the Reformation. Imentioned earlier that the Brotherhood had a long-term aim of using religion forits own ends and then moving on to the next stage, to replace religion, whichlargely abused the knowledge of the spirit, with a godless science whichconvinced the mass of the people that the spirit did not even exist. Part ofthis plan was to dismantle the power of the Christian Church and create morefactions within the Christian religion. Even if they did not actually start theReformation – and I believe they did – they certainly took advantage of it.The real roots of the Reformation were in Germany in the 14th century when anarm of the Brotherhood emerged called the Illuminati, Latin for the Illuminatedor Enlightened Ones. They were closely connected to the Rosicrucians (Latin forthe rose and the cross), which began centuries earlier and was introduced toGermany by the Emperor Charlemagne in the ninth century. At one time at leastyou would be accepted into the Illuminati when you had reached a certain levelof initiation in the Rosicrucians. Both were classic secret societies in themanner I have outlined, and they began covertly to introduce a number ofreligious movements around Europe. One was called the Friends of God led byRulman Merswin, a rich banker, who was conned by the Brotherhood into believinghe had been chosen by God to preach his message because the Pope could no longerbe trusted to do it. What’s more God would soon punish humanity for its sin, hewas told. The End Of The World and the Day of Judgement is another Brotherhoodtheme. The Friends of God was a mind control cult that accepted only totalobedience from its followers. It gained many supporters who were fed up with thecorruption in the Church, and eventually Merswin had a ‘revelation’ that heshould hand over his religion lock, stock, and barrel to another branch of theBrotherhood, probably linked to freemasonry, called the Order of St John.Martin Luther was strongly influenced by some of these German mystical societiesand was especially keen on the writings of the German mystic, Johann Tauler, aman closely connected with the Friends of God. It seems certain, also, thatLuther was a Rosicrucian, given that his personal seal contains both of theirsymbols, the rose and the cross. He was close to many members of the Illuminatiand the Rosicrucians, and they would have been using him, with or without hisknowledge, to break the overwhelming power of the pope. The Vatican was, itself,a Brotherhood tool, but none is allowed to get too powerful, and all areexpendable when the time is right. These two Christian creeds of Protestant andCatholic were now to be used, as we have already seen, to stimulate enormousconflict. But it is important to emphasise that the Brotherhood was not in totalcontrol of all events. I am sure they have had some monumental failures in theirtime, as people have not reacted in the way they expected, or some of theirnumber did not do as they were told once they realised what the game plan was. Ihave no doubt that some of their wars have not had the outcome they always hopedfor. I feel, too, that there have been many periods when the volunteerconsciousness has infiltrated these movements and tried to undermine and changethem from within and I believe that behind the scenes this was possiblyhappening during the time of Sir Francis Bacon who became the highest executiveof the Rosicrucian Order in England. It was during his lifetime in the early1600s that the teachings of the order began to include some references to theneed for personal spiritual salvation by taking control of our own thinking andactions, and some of these are still reflected in that order. The fact thatsomeone in history was a member of a secret society tells us nothing. It is theagenda they were working to that matters, and it wasn’t always negative; farfrom it. To openly pass on esoteric knowledge at this time would have been likewriting a suicide note. What I am sure about, however, is that from theReformation onwards, the Brotherhood takeover by the Luciferic consciousness wasincreasing, and its power to manipulate events was seen to reach new heights.Elizabeth I secured the long-term future of the Episcopalian Church of England,better known as the Anglican Faith. Anyone who didn’t attend local Churchservices was fined or jailed. It was now that the so called Thirty-Nine Articlesof Faith were agreed by Elizabeth and Parliament which everyone had to believeor be condemned as a heretic. I list some of them here and it is worth readingthem carefully because all would-be Anglican clergy still have to swear theiragreement with every word that follows before they are accepted into thepriesthood:God consists of three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are all oneGod.Christ was divine and he suffered as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity.Christ died for humanity, was buried and went down into hell.Christ rose from the grave and took again his body, with flesh and bones, withwhich he ascended to heaven where he sits till he returns on the day ofJudgment.The Holy Ghost is of the same substance, majesty and glory as the Father andSon.The Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation; everythingoutside of the scriptures is unnecessary for salvation.Jesus is the only mediator between God and Man. No Christian is free from theobedience of the Commandments.The Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the Apostles’ Creed ought to bethoroughly believed.All deserve God’s wrath and damnation, but there is no condemnation of believerswho are baptised.Man has no power to do good works without the grace of God.Our righteousness before God comes, not by our works, but by the merit ofChrist. Therefore we are justified only by faith and not by works.Good works cannot put away sin, yet they are pleasing to God.Works not springing from faith are not pleasant to God, yet rather they have thenature of sin.Doing more than duty requires cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety.Jesus was sinless, the Lamb without spot who sacrificed himself and took awaythe sins of the world.Repentance is not denied to such as fall into sin after baptism.Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, to deliver from curseand damnation those whom he has chosen in Christ, to bring them everlastingsalvation.They are accursed who believe that every man shall be saved by the Law or whoframe their lives according to the light of nature.The effect of Christ’s ordinance is not withdrawn because of the officiatingpriest’s wickedness.All non-believers ought to be considered by the faithful as heathen andpublican.This is the faith that to this day is taught by law in the schools of Britainand other countries and is given guaranteed, no-questions-asked, air-time by theBBC which claims to be an independent organisation. It is an outrage. If itwasn’t so tragic it would make a comedy series.Elizabeth ensured that the Protestant Faith would survive when her navy defeatedthe Spanish Armada in 1588. One of the commanders of the English Navy wasFrancis Drake, a former pirate turned admiral, who was the second man tocircumnavigate the world. Philip II of Spain had been urged by Pope Pius V toinvade England, kill the ‘bastard’ Queen, and restore the rule of Catholicism.Pius V was the man who was burning, hanging and beheading the religiousreformers in Italy. Philip was further motivated in his duty by the terribleatrocities committed against the Catholics of England and Ireland. He believedthat such atrocities should only be committed against Protestants. The ships ofthe Armada contained ninety members of the Spanish Inquisition ready to beginwork when England was re-taken for the Pope. But the Armada was defeated in theEnglish Channel and the power of Rome and Spain was dimmed. The foothold theProtestant Faith had won in Europe was secured. If the Spanish had conqueredEngland the whole Protestant movement might have collapsed. When Elizabeth diedin 1603, England and Scotland united under one monarch. They had been inconflict over thousands of years, but now James VI of Scotland became James I ofEngland, too. The Kingdom was united – on paper at least.The 16th and 17th centuries in England during the reign of Elizabeth and laterwas a time of great ‘volunteer’ activity as they sought to raise humanunderstanding through art and scientific research. Sir Francis Bacon workedwithin the secret societies and I believe he wrote the ‘Shakespeare’ plays andincluded in them esoteric codes. Anthony, the brother of Francis, ran a ‘spynetwork’ which was a front for passing on esoteric knowledge. I feel that atthis time there was a secret society operating within a secret society and thatwhen, in the end, the Brotherhood realised what was going on the Bacons andothers were stopped by a campaign of covert killings and trumped-up charges thatsaw Francis sent to jail. When you look at the life of Sir Francis Bacon nothingis quite what it seems to be on the surface. He made some misguided decisions aseveryone does, but I believe his intent was positive in his desire to build a“new Atlantis.” Every effort to raise the human condition and its understandingof life was viciously opposed by the Church, Protestant and Catholic, and somany suffered all over the world for seeking and exchanging knowledge.In 1564, Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa in Italy. He was to develop the use ofthe telescope to study the skies and his research led him to the conclusionthat, contrary to what the Church said, the Sun did not circle the Earth – itwas the other way round. Nor did he believe the Earth was the centre of theUniverse. This confirmed the findings of Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish scientistwho had died in 1543. Copernicus had continued the work begun nearly 2,000 yearsearlier by Pythagoras and others. Copernicus had been pilloried by the Churchfor his ‘heresy’ and his work suppressed. Almost a century later the same was tohappen to Galileo. It could well be that he was a reincarnation of Copernicus.Galileo was tried for heresy in 1632 by the Inquisition for writing a booksupporting the Copernicus theory. A document was falsified by the Church to backup the case against him. He was found guilty of ‘holding and teaching theCopernicus doctrine’ (i.e. saying the Earth goes around the Sun and is not thecentre of the Universe). Galileo escaped the most extreme methods of theInquisition, but he was placed under house arrest for the last eight years ofhis life. You can see how dogmatic religion has held back human evolution andunderstanding. It was only in this decade that the Roman Catholic Churchofficially admitted that Galileo was right!! It is interesting to note that someof his fiercest critics were other academics and scientists who realised theconsequences of his findings for their power and influence. The same attitude isstill prevalent today.During this period there were many seers and prophets who predicted the futurein terms very similar in themes to those being presented today. Nostradamus, wholived in Southern France, is the most famous of them. I feel he was predictingwhat would happen if humanity continued on the path it had embarked upon. Bytuning your consciousness to those vibrations of thought energy that retainCreation’s eternal memory, you can ‘see’ the past with your psychic vision orchannel information about it. You can experience something of a past life or seea past event. In the same way you can ‘see’ the future. I believe thatconsciousness is constantly projecting forward how things will be on the basisof what has happened (the past) and what is happening (the present). From thesesources, the collective consciousness projects forward what will happen if thosesame trends continue. So the future exists as the past exists in thought energythat is outside of our version and understanding of space and time. When peopletune to that vibration, they are accessing information about the projectedfuture, not necessarily the future as it will be. I believe this was theinformation that Nostradamus was tuning to for his famous predictions and he wasalso accessing knowledge of the plan for the transformation of humanconsciousness in the time we are living in now as we progress into the PhotonBelt. Obviously, the closer the event is to the present the more likely it is tohappen as projected. But the further into the future you go, the more time thereis for humans to change and therefore to change the future. It is a commentaryon the scale of humanity’s imprisonment of thought that the outcome is unfoldingvery much along the lines that Nostradamus predicted, but it doesn’t have to. Wecan change it.Before we move on from this period of the 1600s, we need to record thebeginnings of the most important vehicle of Brotherhood control andmanipulation. It was to give this amalgamation of secret, covert, groupings thepower to advance its desire for global domination like never before. We call itthe world money system.Throughout human history, the purchase of goods and services had been throughbarter, one thing exchanged directly for another, or by coins which were madefrom metals which reflected the value of the coin. This made metals like goldand silver more valuable than others, because they could be used to make coinsand thereby could be exchanged for whatever you liked. But then a series ofevents began to happen. People didn’t want to have all that gold and silverlying around waiting to be stolen, so it became the custom to deposit thesemetals with those who had strongrooms where it would be safe. Many of thesestrong-rooms were owned by goldsmiths. The goldsmith would give receipts to thecustomer for the value of the deposit and when these were returned they wouldhand back that amount of precious metals. The customers began to use thesereceipts as forms of exchange because they were more convenient than moving themetals around and the goldsmiths, and other strong-room owners, realised thatonly a small number of these receipts were returned to them at any one time bypeople coming to collect their metal deposits. So why could they not issuereceipts to people who didn’t actually own any of the metals and then chargethem interest for the privilege? What a great idea. You could lend money onmetal owned by someone else and charge a fee for doing it! The receipt (money)was worthless if all the owners of your metal deposits wanted them returned atthe same time, but as this never happened you were laughing, unless you issuedfar too many notes.From this has come today’s banking system which is controlled by the Brotherhoodto further its ends. Banks are allowed literally to invent money well in excessof their actual assets and charge interest on that money. The governments andpeople of the world are now submerged under debt to the banks of staggeringproportions, and that debt is money conjured out of nothing by the bankingsystem. Type in a few figures on a computer screen, move that number to aperson’s account on another part of the computer programme, and from that momentyou can start charging that person interest on money that isn’t yours, anddoesn’t physically exist. More than that, if a person falls behind in theinterest payments on money you don’t own and doesn’t exist, you can take theirhome and possessions that do exist, and even have them sent to prison.By this simple means you can put governments and people into so muchmanufactured debt that they become pawns which you can move around the board atwill. You can force people to do what they have no wish to do because they haveto earn the money to pay you back the money you did not own in the first place,and it is the same with governments. It is utterly insane for banks under nogovernment control to be given this power to create money out of nothing, butthe Brotherhood societies, at the highest level in this case, brought this intobeing and manipulate entire nations and continents with it day after day. It hasalso allowed more wars to be fought and prolonged, because instead of beinglimited to the assets a country owned, the bankers could now issue pieces ofpaper to keep the conflict going. Then, after the war, the governments were evenfurther in debt and their people would have to suffer more hardships if theircountry was going to pay back the banks for the money that did not exist. Nowwars not only became wonderful tools of control for the Brotherhood, they werefantastic ways to increase their wealth. They couldn’t lose. They would lendinvented money to both sides, charge them interest on it, and then lend themmore invented money to rebuild the countries that had been devastated by thosewars. And we, men and women of the world, continue to put up with it! The firstmajor bank of this kind was the Bank of Amsterdam set up in the early 1600s andit immediately began to lend to the Dutch government to finance more wars. TheBank of England followed in 1694 and became the model for all the others.These centuries we have discussed were of enormous significance, with theRenaissance opening the minds of Europeans to the knowledge of Greece, theReformation breaking the power of the Pope, and the introduction of the bankingsystem. Within the mass of the people, dissatisfaction was stirring at the waythey were treated and the foundations for rebellion and eventually parliamentarydemocracy were in place. It would still take many centuries to arrive and theChurch would battle to prevent it, but the cracks had appeared in their wall ofreligious suppression and the flood was sure to follow."},{"pageContent":"8Eagle TailsAN area of substantial volunteer activity over the thousands of years after thedemise of Atlantis have been the lands we call the Americas.North, South and Central America were populated by groups of nomadic andagricultural peoples long before the Sumerians were settling in Mesopotamia. Youwould think, if you didn’t know, that American history began with the coming ofthe European invaders, but that happened only a few hundred years ago. TheAmericas evolved with the thousands of tribes which developed with their diversecultures and beliefs. As in the rest of the world, some would grow and conquerothers to create empires. One of these was the Aztecs in what we call Mexico.They were advanced in that they built fantastic pyramids and cities, as did manypeoples of the Americas, but at the same time they slaughtered untold thousandsin sacrifices to their gods at the whim of the priests. You can see howcivilisations across the world were being affected by some global consciousnessor the same extra-terrestrial races that encouraged them to believe the samemyths.There are many similarities between the Sumerian and Egyptian cultures and whathas been found of ancient American history. The all-seeing eye is there; so arethe pyramids, some with great similarities to those in Egypt. The featheredserpent symbol found widely in the Americas can be mirrored by the serpent godsof India and the winged serpents of Egyptian legend. Stories can be found of thegods who created human beings and tried to make them their slaves. The themes ofAtlantis, Sumer, Babylon and Egypt apply equally to the Americas.One of the intriguing and interesting peoples of the Americas were the Maya. Itis believed that they evolved from another people called the Olmecs, and bothbuilt amazing pyramids. The connections between the beliefs of the Maya and theEgyptians are obvious. The Maya pyramids were faced with limestone as was theGreat Pyramid at Giza, and the beliefs in mummifying bodies and the nature oflife after death were similar. I think there is an excellent chance that thesame ET races were responsible for developing both civilisations in their earlydays or maybe it was the collective mind at work. But the Mayan civilisationlasted for thousands of years and we should not fall into the trap of thinkingit was always the same. Some Mayans apparently practised human sacrifice, butthis was not general. These things change. What is termed the Classic Mayanperiod is reckoned to have been from about 435 to 830AD, when their cultureseems to have stopped quite abruptly. The Maya settled on the land now known asGuatemala and north to Yucatan and in that classic period they devised ameasurement of time very different to our own today. It related to naturalenergy cycles and they devised a mathematical system of numbers and symbols towork out the cycles and translate them into a form of language. The Maya, someof whom were from highly-evolved volunteer consciousness, left records of theircalendar and mathematical system. They believed that the Earth began a new cycleof evolution in 3113BC and that this would be completed in 2012. This would linkin very well with what I am saying about the Photon Belt and the many propheciesthrough the ages of great change at this time. Numbers and symbols can be foundon the ruins and artifacts of many ancient civilisations. As we are nowbeginning to understand again, everything is an energy, numbers and symbolsincluded. Numbers and symbols represent certain energy vibrations and the Mayansystem was a mathematical code for energies and their cycles.It’s funny how we have this idea that evolution and understanding can onlyprogress and cannot go backwards. This belief insists that peoples a decade agolet alone 1,500 years ago could not possibly know more about Creation than wedo. This is a fallacy. The knowledge exists outside of this dense physicalplanet and always has. It has been a case of getting that knowledge through theimbalances and the dense vibration of the Earth to our conscious levels. Thiscould have happened in Central America in 435 far easier than in the years ofreligious imposition in Europe and the Middle East when minds were slamming shutin their hundreds of thousands through fear and the thought-police.One other point to remember is that while the ancient Maya may be gone, theirenergy has not. When we think we create energy fields and so in that former landof the Maya, as with Egypt and elsewhere, the knowledge they worked with isstill there waiting to be accessed. Going to these places and quietly tuninginto the energy fields can open up your understanding quicker than reading athousand history books. If you tap into this ancient knowledge held in thoughtenergy fields you can learn so much about them. It doesn’t come on sheets ofpaper, it is a knowingness, an inspired understanding that you cannot alwaysdescribe.In South America, volunteers incarnated to work in the area around Lake Titicacawhich spans today’s Peru – Bolivia border. These groups would later move northand evolve into the Inca civilisation centred around Cusco in the Andes. TheIncas worshipped the Sun god, and again this could have been based on anunderstanding of the consciousness of the Sun as a purveyor of universalknowledge and wisdom. At their peak the Incas controlled an area of 2,000 milesby 200, and they became motivated by power, wealth, and expansion as theoriginal understanding was lost. The choice of location for these volunteerincarnations was linked to the points on the energy grid which needed to beworked on. The region that includes Lake Titicaca, Sun Island, Cusco, MachuPicchu, and the Sacred Valley of the Incas, is one of the most powerful on theplanet.I am not suggesting for a second that the incarnations of the volunteerconsciousness were always shining reflections of virtue. They were men and womenof their time and they were affected by the culture they were born into. Theystill are. What they had was a more powerful link with their higherconsciousness and this had two positive effects. Firstly information andinspiration could be brought down to this level. This showed itself in those whochallenged the bigotry of religion and authority and advanced humanunderstanding through philosophy and scientific discovery. Secondly, they wereopen channels to ground powerful energies and pass them into the grid.Some significant volunteer incarnations were in North America among the tribesof what have become known as ‘Red Indians’. The ‘Indians’ (Native Americans)understood the basics of the energy system and their medicine wheels werecircles of stones where ceremonies took place at points on the energy grid.Obviously, they would not have understood exactly what they were doing withinthe confines of the physical form, but the connection with the higher self wasstrong enough for them to do what was necessary on the physical level. Theypassed on their understanding in legends and stories which contained many truthsportrayed symbolically and many myths, too, I’m sure. More than anything theyhad a respect for the Earth and the rest of Creation, which led them to takefrom nature only what they believed they needed. Every civilisation has its‘classic’ periods as with the Maya when the volunteer consciousness was there innumbers for a specific time and task, and so it was with the Native Americantribes through the centuries. They, too, had endless secret societies to pass ontheir knowledge.The culture was not all-peaceful and all-knowing, nor should we have expected itto be. There is, I feel, a naive belief that those who come from higher levelsto help the Earth cannot be genuine unless they behave ‘perfectly’. The myths ofJesus have sprung from this idea. It doesn’t matter how evolved your higherself, the incarnating lower self is still subject to the imbalances, the densevibration, and the culture it is incarnating into. The Indian tribes fought eachother as inherited distrust and hatred spanned the generations and being a bravewarrior was the way male status was often measured.I would not wish to give the impression that these incarnations of thevolunteers all produced people with piercing blue eyes who blessed theirenemies, healed the sick and disappeared on a cloud into heaven at the end ofit. They have had to live with the pressures of this world and some have gonethrough an entire physical life without their higher knowledge manifesting.There are many like that today, unfortunately. All I am saying is that, overall,these volunteers have done a tremendous amount to keep the Earth and thespiritual understandings alive until this time of transformation.So we are looking at the Americas before the European invasion peopled by tribesand empires of great diversity of culture and outlook. Some were highly evolvedin their understanding, some still primitive, some a bit of both. Some were atwar with each other, some at peace. None would have known of a Saviour godcalled Jesus Christ or even that Christianity and the people of the Middle Eastand Europe even existed, but they were now to find out in an orgy of genocide asthe will of the representatives of the Christian god arrived on their shores.According to conventional history, Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa in1436 and became convinced that the Earth was round, not flat as the Churchclaimed. He believed that if he sailed West he would go around the world and endup in India and the Far East which Marco Polo had identified. He asked the Kingsof Spain, Portugal, and England for funds, but was turned down. Eventually hewas supported by a group of Spanish merchants and he set out in the Santa Maria,flanked by two other ships, in 1492. After months of sailing he went on todiscover the Bahamas and other Islands, including Cuba. To the end, it is said,Columbus believed he had landed in India and so we have names like the WestIndies and ‘Indians’.But is there more to all this than mainstream history has recorded? Could thesecret societies have been behind it? Columbus is known to have dressedsometimes in a habit similar to that of the Franciscan Order. His son said hisfather died in such attire. This does not have to mean he was a member of thatorder, however. Remember the priests at the Brotherhood temple in El-Amarna backin Ancient Egypt wore something similar and so did several groups of the sameBrotherhood tradition in Columbus’ time, including the Fraternities. Manly P.Hall in his book, America’s Assignment with Destiny, speculates that Columbusmay have been a student of the Illuminated Raymond Tully, as rumours suggested.Hall says that he was certainly involved in a group supporting the views of theItalian poet, Dante (1265-1321), who was a member of the Cathar Church, friendof Roger Bacon, and an initiate of the Knights Templar. There is a strongfeeling that the Brotherhood were behind Columbus. His belief that the Earth wasround could have originated, at least in part, from his knowledge of theesoteric tradition of Asia and the Near East. In his book on Columbus, SeraphimG. Canoutas of the University of Athens, says that secret preparations for thecolonisation of the ‘Blessed Isles of the West’ (the Americas) were known to theCathars and the chivalric Orders of Knighthood. The evidence is increasing thatthe secret society elite knew very well that America existed long before it wasofficially ‘found’.Columbus returned to Spain with gold, cotton and other ‘finds’ including twonatives who were to be baptised into the Christian faith. This changed theattitude of the King of Spain and when Columbus sailed again for ‘India’ thefollowing year he took with him 1,500 men in seventeen ships. The Pope had givenhim permission to take possession of all the lands he found in the name of theKing of Spain who had already agreed to share the booty with his Holiness.Columbus became governor of the lands he found. Not only did he take them fromthe native population, he introduced slavery and treated the people with thesort of religious goodwill that is so widely documented in this book. Columbuswas always saying prayers, and his brutality against the natives had the fullsupport of the priests who had travelled with him. Christianity which had spreadits darkness across the ‘old’ world had now reached the Americas.Western Europe was desperate for a share of the spoils which Columbus hadidentified and others were soon to follow his path across the Atlantic. Vasco DaGama, a Portuguese, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and on to the realIndia. A Spaniard, Vicente Pinzon, who sailed on that first journey withColumbus, led his own expedition and found Brazil closely followed by thePortuguese. In 1519, Magellan, another native of Portugal, led an attempt tosail around the World. He died on the journey, but others completed thecircumnavigation, so proving that the planet was indeed a sphere. These journeysand others increased the knowledge of geography and horizons were widened in alldirections. Over the next four centuries the powerful countries of Europe wouldbattle for the ownership of distant lands throughout Africa, Asia and theAmericas. It was the greatest act of piracy and robbery the world has ever seen.The British, Dutch, French, Belgians, Spanish, Portuguese and others plunderedthe planet imposing their culture and religion on the native peoples, mostlykilling or banishing into slavery all who resisted. Australia and New Zealandwere found and ‘Christianised’.The name Cortez will always be remembered by the peoples of Central America. Hewas a Christian zealot who landed there in 1519 at the time of the local kingcalled Montezuma. Cortez was treated well by the native peoples who thought hewas the long awaited return of their god, Quetzalcohatl, which translates as‘our beloved son’. The beliefs surrounding him are yet more compelling evidenceof a common source connecting the Middle East and the Americas. He was said tohave been born to a virgin, Chimalman, who was told by a heavenly messenger thatshe would conceive a son without sexual intercourse. Quetzalcohatl was also saidto have been tempted by the devil, to have fasted for forty days and to havebeen crucified. But Montezuma’s people were soon to realise that Cortez was nosecond coming of this god. Once he saw the wealth and magnificence of theculture, he set about killing thousands to force upon them Spanish rule andChristianity. Among their conquests were the lands of the Maya which hadcontinued to be populated by those who came after the Classic Mayan period.Accept gentle Jesus as your saviour or we slaughter you was the basic message ofthe invading Europeans. One Spanish historian of the time estimated that twelvemillion natives of South America alone were killed after the Europeans landedand an even greater number became slaves. It was claimed with pride that GreatBritain owned so many countries that the Sun never set on the British Empire.This glorious empire was, like all of its kind, a means to exploit and dominatefor reasons of riches, resources and trade. I would not suggest that everythingthe Europeans did in these countries was negative and without merit, but themotivation and imposition behind these conquests was appalling. The consequencesof this occupation are still being unravelled.There was no need for all this murder and suffering for these different culturesto interact. It could have been done for mutual benefit. But the Lucifericconsciousness had implanted the belief in enough people that whatever you wantedyou took by force and you imposed your will and religion. Your god was always onyour side and whatever you did you did for him. As long as you had been baptisedand believed in St Paul’s Saviour-god called Jesus Christ you were guaranteed aplace in heaven no matter what you did. Indeed it is even in the Articles ofFaith of the Church of England to this day that good deeds are not the way tosalvation. Add to that the condemnation of heathens in the Bible and the beliefthat all non-Christians, even non-believers in your faction of Christianity,were heathens and you can see how these native peoples had no chance of humanetreatment from the great majority of invaders. As one of the Psalms says:“I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts ofthe earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thoushalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”We are highlighting in this chapter the development of the Americas andparticularly North America which was to become, in the form of the UnitedStates, the most powerful nation on the planet – on the surface, at least. TheSpanish and Portuguese plundered most of South America, where they destroyed thenative culture and beliefs and introduced Christianity in the form of RomanCatholicism, that dark creed which still enslaves the minds of millions on thatcontinent through fear and guilt. North America became largely the property ofthe English and French although Pope Alexander VI had ‘given’ the whole of theAmericas to Spain and Portugal, especially Spain (he was a Spaniard). Four yearsafter Columbus discovered the West Indies, two Venetians based in Bristol,England, sailed with the backing of Henry VII for North America. They were Johnand Sebastian Cabot, father and son, and they followed the route taken byearlier explorers like the Vikings who had landed in the New York area fivehundred years before. They called it Vinland.John Cabot’s real name was Giovanni Caboto. He was, like Columbus, born in Genoaand he later became a naturalised Venitian. Interestingly, especially as Cabotlived at the same time as Columbus, he had secret society connections, too, andvisited the same “Wise Men” of the Near East that Columbus is said to have met.Some historians suggest that Cabot was involved with the secret Christian sectcalled the Johannites which followed the esoteric doctrines of the Templars.Many other early explorers and colonizers of the Americas have been shown to bemembers of the secret society network. Sir Francis Bacon would later use thisnetwork to advance the colonisation of North America to stop the Spanish takingcontrol of that land and to further his belief in building a great worldcommonwealth called The New Atlantis. “Shakespeare’s” play, The Tempest, wouldappear to describe Bacon’s ambitions.The Cabots discovered the North American coast, but little was done about theirfind for many years and by then the Frenchman, Jacques Cartier, had laid claimfor his country to the region of what is now Eastern Canada. He was followed byanother Frenchmen, Samuel de Champlain, who founded Canada and built a fortwhich he called Quebec. His ambition was to convert the native tribes to RomanCatholicism and expand the fur trade, which involved the native peoples givinghim furs in exchange for guns and booze. His intervention started wars betweenthe tribes and caused great disruption. But he did not convert them toChristianity, not least because the Catholics and Protestants in his midst spendmost of their time fighting each other. Other Christian missionaries who triedto force their religion upon the Indians were killed by the very guns that hadbeen traded for the furs.The religious persecution in Britain and Europe now involved not only thepersecution of Catholics by Protestants and vice versa, but also the persecutionof factions within the Protestant creed who differed, often on the mostirrelevant details, from the Anglican or orthodox Protestant faiths. This drovemany Puritans and Nonconformists to risk the dangerous and treacherous journeyto North America. Under James I, who followed Elizabeth, Puritans andPresbyterians were persecuted because James was a staunch Anglican. He alsoordered a gruesome purge against ‘witches’ (mediums) and his treatment of RomanCatholics was so terrible, two of their number, Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby,organised the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 to assassinate him. It was James Iwho took part of Northern Ireland from the Catholics and encouraged it to besettled by English and Scottish Protestants. This set in motion the centuries ofhatred and conflict between the two Christian factions that created a sort ofreligious apartheid that still continues. Britain under James I was not a goodplace to be unless you were an Anglican, and the exodus to America grew. ManyPuritans settled in a place they called New England where they matched theviolence and intolerance shown to them in Europe with their own treatment of theIndians and others who did not share their misguided Faith. In Virginia, tobaccowas the currency and people were fined 501bs of tobacco for not attendingchurch, 2,0001bs for not having their child baptised, and 5,0001bs forentertaining a Quaker. Death is no cure for ignorance and neither is a journeyacross the Atlantic. This led William Penn, a compassionate Quaker, to foundPennsylvania in 1682, on land given to him by Charles II in exchange for themoney lent to him by Penn’s father. He opened his lands to Quakers and allpersecuted Nonconformists, and made friends with the Indians. He showed how theycould live together to their mutual benefit. The Indians also gave a piece ofland to Roger Williams who founded the State of Rhode Island as a haven of peaceand religious tolerance. Mostly, however, the North American settlers treatedthe Indians and people of differing beliefs as heathen with no dignity or rightsunder God.By the 18th century the French had been driven out of North America by theBritish who treated these lands as an extension of the British Isles. But thesettlers were beginning to resent this. They still paid allegiance to theBritish King, but they rebelled when they were told to pay taxes to the BritishGovernment without their consent. Troops were dispatched to force the settlersinto submission and the American War of Independence began. Brotherhood-stylesecret societies with the familiar initiations and methods were already at workin the Americas before the European invasion, but after that their numberssimply exploded and they were extremely involved in the events before theAmerican War of Independence. Freemasonry abounded and George Washington was aleading freemason of high rank, initiated into the Craft at the age of twenty in1752. As an officer in the colonial army, he is believed by some historians tohave ordered the killing of French troops in the Ohio Valley when there was nomilitary justification, let alone a moral one. This created more conflictbetween the British and French which flared in Europe as the bitter and bloodySeven Years War. This claimed around a million military and civilian casualtiesand left both countries with enormous debts to the money inventors, the bankingelite controlled by the Brotherhood. There was also the cost of keeping an armyin America. All this led the British to levy higher taxation on her people, andduties on goods in the American colonies, to service the debt, and hence you hadthe disputes that fuelled the War of Independence. The resistance in thecolonies was so fierce that the British withdrew the new duties, except forthose on tea. The colonists were by now whipped up by the Freemason lodgesmasquerading as revolutionary groups and this was coordinated from the MotherLodge in London. Members of the St Andrew’s Lodge in Boston dressed up asIndians and threw tea into the harbour in protest at the duty and, no matterwhat the British had done, it was too late. The Brotherhood wanted independencefor America for longer-term motives and that was the way it was going to be. Itis pretty clear that the Freemasons had been working to stir up revolutionagainst the British for at least ten years before the war began, and had beenguided by the Brotherhood elite in London.The war was fought over six years until the Americans won and the British weresent packing. George Washington was Commander in Chief of the American troopsand he was to become the first President of the newly-formed United States ofAmerica. He was a freemason as I have pointed out and so were most, perhaps all,of the key revolutionaries; many of them were Grand Masters. Masons likeWashington and Franklin had the symbol of the All Seeing Eye sewn onto theirsheepskin Masonic aprons. This was without question a Brotherhood revolution.Independence was declared in 1776, although the war went on for some years afterthat, until the decisive Battle of Yorktown in 1781 settled the issue of whowould rule the country. The Americans were supported with arms and resources bythe French after one of the revolutionaries, the freemason, Benjamin Franklin,persuaded them to help. The French were looking for some revenge for theirdefeats by the British and, even if they were not, the Brotherhood network inFrance would have made sure that help was forthcoming. Franklin secured theservices in France of the German freemason Baron von Steuben who had served inthe army of Frederick the Great of Prussia and he was to play a major part inturning the American army into a fighting force. With victory secured theDeclaration of Independence severed ties with Britain, but not the BritishBrotherhood.The symbols of the new nation reflected those of the Brotherhood and itsbranches which had brought it into being. In 1782 a man called William Bartonproduced a design for the Seal of the new United States and it included theclassic symbols of the Brotherhood since ancient Egypt – the pyramid topped byan all-seeing eye. Below that were the words Novus Ordo Seclorum which mean ‘Anew order of the ages’. This refers to the Brotherhood’s ‘Great Work of Ages’and it is expressed today as The New World Order. This part of Barton’s designis included in the United States Great Seal today, and on the dollar bill. Thephoenix, another Egyptian Brotherhood symbol, was also on the original sealbefore it was later replaced by the Eagle. American Freemasonry broke away fromits ‘Mother Lodge’ in England after independence and adopted the English YorkRite of Freemasonry with its ten degrees of initiation and most significantly,the Scottish Rite, with its thirty-three degrees. The Scottish rite inparticular has had a fundamental influence on American politics, economics, andforeign policy from that time on. The Brotherhood controls the American banksand the Federal Reserve, their version of the Bank of England, which createsmoney out of nothing and plays the tune to which the elected politicians have todance. That is not to say that all the revolutionaries were involved inskullduggery and wished to bring about this abuse of freedom or that the desirefor revolution was wrong. Why should one country own another in that way? Mostif not all the revolutionaries would have believed they were doing the rightthing for the right reasons, but who was controlling their thinking from theperspective of another agenda? It is not always the event itself that is wrong,but the hidden agenda behind it.One man who played an important part in the fight for American independencecould rightly be included among the great men of human history. If ever therewas an example of the volunteer consciousness incarnate, it is he. Thomas Painewas born the son of a Norfolk Quaker in 1736. His outspoken support of theoppressed in England and his opposition to religion made him highly unpopularwith the authorities and he went to America to support the people in theirdispute with the British Parliament and King George III. He fought on theAmerican side and published a pamphlet called ‘Common Sense’ which called forcomplete independence for the colonies and not some diluted compromise thatwould still leave them under British rule. Another pamphlet, ‘The Crisis’,motivated the people to go on when the situation looked bleak. His words werewidely read and they are credited with having a significant impact on the courseof the War.He was a renowned figure when independence was won, but instead of enjoying theglory he returned home to England hoping to do the same there. He wrote TheRights of Man in 1791 which exposed the corruption and nonsense of Church,monarch, and state, while setting out an alternative society based on democracy,education and equal rights for all. This was the time after the FrenchRevolution when the British gentry were terrified of a people’s rebellion. Awrit was issued for his arrest, but his work circulated rapidly among the poorwho at last had someone speaking for them. Anyone found publishing or possessingThe Rights of Man was jailed or banished and effigies of Paine with a ropearound his neck were carried through the streets by those whose power hethreatened. He was a man ahead of his time, but such men are vital to light thefuse which later explodes into fundamental change. Paine escaped to France wherehe was elected to the new French Assembly. He was appointed to the committeeputting together a new French Constitution and he argued that there should be nobloodshed or reprisals against the monarchy and aristocracy. He wanted todestroy the institutions of repression, not kill the people in them. When hevoted against the killing of King Louis XVI he was arrested and sentenced todeath. Here we are again with one tyranny and rule by fear replacing another.George Washington was asked for help, but refused and it took the efforts ofothers to win his release a year later. During his captivity he wrote his book,The Age of Reason, which dismantled the preposterous claims of Christianitywhich he said were not the work of God, but of stupid men. His book said of theBible:“Whenever I read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel andtortuous executions, the relentless vindictiveness with which more than half theBible is filled, it would be more consistent if we call it the word of demonthan the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corruptand brutalise Mankind. And for my part, I detest it as I detest everything thatis cruel.”Thomas Paine was a great, great, man. ‘The world is my country and to do good ismy religion’, he once said, and the only trinity he had any time for was Truth,Liberty, and Justice. Yet history has largely forgotten him because no juvenilereligion was set up in his name. In Christendom you could call for politicalliberty if it suited the people, but not for religious liberty. When Painereturned to America after the publication of the book he was shunned by those hehad helped to free. In some areas it was even dangerous for him to walk down thestreet. But then he was used to religious opposition in America, because inearlier times they had opposed his opposition to slavery. The United States wasbuilt on the backs of black slaves from Africa. Slavery had been part of humanlife through most of history and some of the popes were the biggest slave ownersof their day. The idea of the chosen ones having God’s permission to own theheathens was a constant justification. In the Bible we read:“Both thy bondsmen and thy bondsmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of theheathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondsmen and bondsmaids.Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of themshall ye buy; and of their families that are with you, which they begat in yourland; and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take them as aninheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; theyshall be your bondsmen forever.”That is from Leviticus, and these are the words of St Paul:“Slaves obey your Earthly masters with respect and fear. And with sincerity ofheart as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favour whentheir eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from yourheart.”The Christian creed had no problem with slavery. It was God’s will. Hundreds ofthousands of native Africans were captured by the slave ships of Britain,America, and elsewhere and taken to the New World to be sold to the highestbidder. The hymn writer, John Newton, was the master on a slave ship and fromhis pen came ‘How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer’s ear’. Opponentsto this stunning inhumanity called slavery were hung, shot, and burned alive bythe slave owning mobs and sermons were made in support of both slavery and theviolence against protesters. It was a major offence to teach a slave to read,and there were discussions on whether it was best to work a slave to death oruse them more sparingly so they would last longer. (The same debate went on inrelation to the Jews in Nazi Germany). The law allowed slaves to be flogged todeath and shot if they refused to accept the flogging. Their tongues and eyeswere cut out on many occasions and they were branded if they tried to escape.The British were at the heart of this trade and many British companies grewwealthy on it. The British built forts off the African Coast to protect theslave traffic and they gave grants of free land in the West Indies on conditionthat at least four negro slaves were kept for every hundred acres.Slavery became an issue which divided the United States very roughly betweenNorth and South. Most Freemason lodges supported it, but many did not. By farthe greatest number of slaves were concentrated in the Southern States wherethey worked in the cotton fields. Some brave people helped a few escape toCanada at great risk to themselves. Among them was John Brown, an Ohio wooldealer, who was caught and executed. He became a martyr remembered by the famoussong in which ‘his soul goes marching on’. William Lloyd Garrison published TheLiberator which highlighted the treatment of the slaves and was sent to prisonfor his opinions, but it roused yet more to the cause. Harriet Beecher Stowewrote her book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, published in 1852, telling the stories shehad heard from the slaves who had escaped. The Pope ordered the book to bebanned and the clergy condemned its publication.In the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln, an abolitionist, waselected. The South declared independence under its own president, JeffersonDavis, and they increased the powers of slave owners. The United States were nowanything but united. They were two nations, one overwhelmingly for slavery andone against. Lincoln, whose desire for the end of slavery was not as fierce assome, offered to allow it to continue if the South would return, but they didn’ttrust him. The Civil War ensued but, contrary to what is widely believed, it wasnot about the plight of slaves, but the unity of the country. It was like mostconflicts, justified by a contradiction. Lincoln and his supporters went to warto preserve the union under the banner of freedom. But while the behaviour ofthe Southern States was appalling to the slaves, they had every right under theConstitution to withdraw from the union. Lincoln and the North fought to denythem that right. The emancipation of slaves was a by-product of the war, not themotivation behind it. Slavery continued in the North until the war was over, andlegislation to free Southern slaves during the war was enacted only because itwas claimed that the Southerners were no longer United States citizens, andtherefore had lost their rights to own slaves as those in the North continued todo.The South, the ‘rebels’ or ‘Confederates’ held the initiative in the firstphases of the war but, after losing the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, the North,the ‘Federalists’, turned the tide and went on to victory. By then half amillion people had died at a cost of nearly two billion pounds to the US economyand the belief that a state could decide at will to withdraw from the Union asagreed by the Founding Fathers was crushed. The United States was now a nation,as were Germany and Italy in the wake of their civil wars which happened in thissame period. The USA would produce great inventors and many skilled in trade andbusiness as they exploited and directed the Industrial Revolution to become theworld’s most powerful country. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865. He wasabout to introduce a system in which the US government printed its owninterest-free money, independent of the banking elite. Almost exactly 100 yearslater, John F. Kennedy was planning to do the same when he was murdered inDallas.The tragic victims of the expansion across the North American continent in boththe United States and Canada were the native tribes. They were pushed into theinterior by the settlers who advanced westwards until there was nowhere left forthe Indians to go. When they lost the many battles to retain their homelandsthey were forced onto reservations which were, themselves, gradually reduced bythe economic ‘needs’ of the government. White men did indeed speak with forkedtongue when they made their promises to the Indians which were never kept. Thestory of the genocide of the native Americans by the settlers from Europe is oneof the most atrocious episodes in the long and sorry tale of man’s inhumanity toman. The reality of these events is only now beginning to be told in films like‘Dances With Wolves’ and the truth is breaking through the Hollywood andgovernment propaganda of most of this century which portrayed the Indians assavages and the God-fearing settlers as the agents of freedom and civilisation.In Australia and the other countries where invading Christians occupied nativelands by force and brutality the truth of these times is being more widelyunderstood.In my travels to Canada and the United States I have had the overwhelmingfeeling that I have had many past lives as an Indian. When I was in Calgary,Canada, I saw a picture of a chief and I felt a strong and instinctive bond withhim. His name was ‘Sitting on an Eagle Tail’, chief of the North Peigans, one ofa group of tribes that went under the overall name of Blackfoot. Just tocomplicate matters there was also an individual tribe in the group also calledthe Blackfoot. I travelled through an area known as the Porcupine Hills, southof Calgary near the Old Man River and I have rarely been so moved by a placeanywhere in the world. My spirit just sang with joy. I would later discover thatEagle Tail was one of those who signed the land treaty with the white settlerswhich put the Indian tribes onto reservations and that he had chosen an areaaround the Porcupine Hills and the Old Man River. He loved the area and felt itwas the best place for his people to settle. I talk more of these experiences inTruth Vibrations and In The Light Of Experience. Two years after that trip toCanada, I was walking through Oxford with Yeva looking for the Pitt RiversMuseum which has a section dedicated to Indian history. We were given the wrongdirections to the Museum and we were lost. As we walked I told her about Sittingon an Eagle Tail and how I felt that was a previous incarnation. At that momentwe passed a pub called ‘The Eagle and the Child’. I looked up at the pub signhanging from the wall. There before me was a picture of an eagle with a littlechild sitting on its tail! I have had scores of ‘coincidences’ happen to mesince my awakening became conscious in 1990, but that was a real stunner.I began to read widely of the Indian period in North America and, as with myvisits to former Indian lands, I have felt a deep and painful sadness at the waythat culture and understanding was swept away in such a short time. When Ivisited former Indian lands around Sedona in Arizona, Monument Valley in Utah,and a wonderful place called Enchanted Rock in Texas, I was very affectedemotionally by their beauty and the memories of my Indian lives. I felt suchjoy. But underlying that has always been sadness at what happened. I read a bookabout the life of the Blackfoot Chief, Crowfoot, which also spanned the lifetimeof Eagle Tail. It was sobering to see that when they were born the Indian way oflife had remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years; by the time theydied in the latter part of the last century, their tribes were dependent onhand-outs from the white settlers. Their lands had been taken and theirindependence was gone. These proud people were lining up on their littlereservations to be given their rations. The Christian missionaries had arrivedseeking to impose their creed upon the Indian people. The ‘God-fearers’ wererampant and some of the most tragic and pathetic pictures I have seen are ofIndian people, Bibles in hand and assembled in their Sunday best, waiting to beindoctrinated and mind-controlled in the mission churches built on theirreservations. Nearly fifteen hundred years after the nonsense of Nicaea, it wasnow spreading its arrogance and mind control across North America which, untilthen, had somehow managed to survive very nicely without it.It was only in 1877 that Crowfoot and Eagle Tail had, with others, signed theland treaty that confined them to reservations which the settlers would go ondiminishing whenever they could. By then their tribes had been ravaged by warand diseases like smallpox which the settlers had brought with them. Everypicture I have seen of Eagle Tail portrays a near-broken spirit and, given whathappened in his lifetime, that is easy to understand.They had been the victims of the industrialisation of the world that had begunin Britain and spread like a cancer across Europe. The influx of settlers fromEurope who emigrated in increasing numbers to the ‘New World’ took with themthat same religious intolerance and economic ethos or imported it once they werethere. The Luciferic consciousness was now unleashing everything it could musterbefore the time of the Great Cleansing which was fast approaching. Much of thehuman race was easy prey, and it was rapidly discovering the means to destroyitself and the planet, too."},{"pageContent":"9The Rule of ScienceTHE Brotherhood had grown enormously in numbers and power over the six thousandyears since Sumer and Egypt and it was now to enter a new phase in its desirefor world domination.It inspired scores of ‘people’s revolutions’ and civil wars to replace themonarchies and it achieved this in the normal way – by working through bothsides to create the conflict and the atmosphere of unrest. Sometimes the monarchwould hold on, more often the revolution would usher in a people’s dictatorshipor ‘democratic government’. The Brotherhood could work more covertly behind thesmokescreen of democracy, but it wished to ensure that enough ‘bogeymen’ existedaround the world to unite people in mutual fear. People in fear are so mucheasier to control, as we shall see. It also had a longer term aim to replacetraditional religion with the Godless version of science called materialism.This was the final stage of the Brotherhood plan to persuade people that theywere just physical, one-life, accidents, with no spirit or eternal purpose. Themore that people can be encouraged to think that way the more they become lockedin materialism and lose touch with who they are. In that state of mind they areperfectly placed to become the robots of the Brotherhood by closing down theirconnections with higher levels of themselves and Creation.In the late 1800s some documents surfaced called the Protocols of the Wise Menof Zion. Almost everything these documents proposed to do has happened in thiscentury. It is quite amazing to read them. According to the book, Waters FlowingEastward, they surfaced in the late 19th Century. In 1884, Mlle. Justine Glinka,the daughter of a Russian General, was involved in some spying and informationgathering in France. She employed a member of the Mizraim Freemasonry Lodge inParis to help with her work and he offered, for a payment of 2,500 francs, toget her a copy of some secret documents, the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion.A copy found its way from her to a Professor Sergius A. Nilus and he publishedthem in them in a book called The Great Within the Small. After the RussianRevolution of 1917, the “revolutionaries” ordered that all Nilus’s books on thesubject were destroyed and he was arrested and tortured, the book says.The Protocols have caused enormous controversy throughout this century and therehave been many claims that they are forgeries, including a famous article in theLondon Times in 1921. I can understand, too, why many Jewish people get so angryabout them when you think how Adolf Hilter used the Protocols and theirreference to Zion to justify his unspeakable treatment of Jews in theconcentration camps. How ironic to think, therefore, that, as we shall see,Hitler was brought to power by the very Brotherhood elite whose game plan forthe world is so brilliantly set out in those Protocols.Let us get one thing very clear. The conspiracy I am exposing is not, repeatnot, a conspiracy by the Jewish people and few have suffered as much as the Jewsin Germany and elsewhere from Brotherhood-engineered events.But if we are going to pick the truth from the falsehood, the wheat from thechaff, we must be adult enough, surely, to see the difference between thecontent of the Protocols and the people given the blame for them. If we don’t wewill throw the baby out with the bath water which is exactly what themanipulators want us to do. We also need to appreciate the difference betweenthe Jewish people as a race and Zionism which is a political movement. You don’thave to be Jewish to be a Zionist and many people who call themselves Zionistsare not Jewish. It is possible that the reference to Zion in the Protocols iscalculated disinformation designed to blame it all, quite wrongly, on Jewishpeople and in that sense they may well be forgeries. But from the perspective ofthe 1990s it is painfully obvious that whoever wrote the protocols was either aprophet of extraordinary powers, or, rather more likely, they knew theBrotherhood game plan for the 20th Century.It is on that basis, and that basis alone, that I will use passages from theProtocols in the next few chapters. I will refer to them as the IlluminatiProtocols to overcome the myth that they are the work of the Jewish people andfrom this point I will also use the name Illuminati to describe the Brotherhoodelite at the top of the Pyramid of secret societies world-wide. At thatIlluminati level, all the secret societies become the SAME organisation. Theword Goyim in the Protocols means non-Jew or Gentile but, again, it is moreaccurate to read this word as cattle or mob, the terms the Protocols also use todescribe the mass of the people. The Protocols acknowledge the Brotherhood’srole in the overthrow of the monarchies:“On the ruins of the natural and genealogical aristocracy of the Goyim we haveset up the aristocracy of our educated class, headed by the aristocracy ofmoney. The qualifications for this aristocracy we have established in wealth,which is dependent onus …. ” (Protocol 1).“Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave the name of‘Great’: the secrets of its preparations are well known to us, for it was allthe work of our hands. Ever since that time we have been leading the people fromone disenchantment to another.” (Protocol 3).The great majority of people who campaigned for the end of the monarchies andagainst the imposition of religion, have done so with the finest of intentions,and it was exactly what needed to happen. The Brotherhood was often pushingagainst an open door with that part of its plan, because people were getting fedup with Church and monarchs. But while most campaigners wanted to replace bothwith true freedom for the human mind and true democracy, the BrotherhoodIlluminati elite had other ideas. It used popular sentiment to overthrowmonarchs and reduce the credibility of the Church, but then used its power toreplace them with an illusion of democracy and a science which denied thatpeople have any other dimension, apart from the physical body.“The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to persuade the mob in all countriesthat their government is nothing but the steward of the people who are theowners of the country and that the steward may be replaced like a worn outglove. It is this possibility of replacing the representatives of the peoplewhich has placed them at our disposal and, as it were, given us the power ofappointment . . . . The (politicians) whom we shall choose from among thepublic, with strict regard to their capabilities for servile obedience, will notbe persons trained in the arts of government and will therefore easily becomepawns in our game in the hands of learning and genius who will be theiradvisors, specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairsof the whole world.” (Protocol 2).“In order that our scheme may produce this result we shall arrange elections infavour of such presidents as have in their past some dark, undiscovered stain,some “Panama” or other — then they will be trustworthy agents for theaccomplishment of our plans out offear of revelations and from the naturaldesire of everyone who has attained power, namely, the retention of privileges,advantages, and honour connected with the office of President (Protocol 10).Freemasonry was to undergo a significant change after the English Civil War andinto the early 1700s. It was opened up to more people who were not masons orcraftsmen by profession and soon they would be by far the majority. In 1717 anew Grand Lodge was launched at a meeting in London and some were to call thisthe Mother Grand Lodge of the World. This was the lodge the American freemasonswere guided by during the War of Independence. Indeed the London Lodgestring-pulled that revolution. The old links with the profession of masonrybecame purely symbolic with titles like Entered Apprentice, Fellow order andMaster Mason, no longer relating in any way to the masons work, but only to thelevels of initiation within the new Freemasonry, the so-called three BlueDegrees. The Mother Grand Lodge quickly expanded its influence across Europe andthe British Empire, issuing permission for other branches to practice the BlueDegree System. In Scotland, Michael Ramsey would establish another branch ofFreemasonry based on the old Knights Templar system, and what became known asthe Scottish Degrees or Rites of Freemasonry would go on to become the dominantform of the Order. Today the Scottish Rite, with the thirty-three degrees ofinitiation, is behind the Freemasonic mafia that controls the USA and many othercountries from behind the scenes today.“We shall create and multiply freemasonic lodges in all countries of the world,absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in public activity, forin these lodges we shall find our principle intelligence office and means ofinfluence. All these lodges we shall bring under one central administration,known to us alone and to all others absolutely unknown, which will be composedof our learned elders (Illuminati) . . . . In these lodges we shall tie togetherthe knot which binds together all revolutionary and liberal movements. Theircomposition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret politicalplots will be known to us and will fall under our guiding hands on the very dayof their conception.” (Protocol 15).The English Civil War brought a temporary end to the monarchy and even in thelonger term, dramatically reduced its power. The Royalists (Anglicans) weredefeated by the Roundheads (Nonconformists) and Charles I was executed in 1649.The first attempt at government by the people was in fact government by OliverCromwell, a morose Puritan squire who ruled as Lord Protector with the supportof his army. He banned Anglican services and continued penal laws against theCatholics. Cromwell purged non-believers in his view of Christianity andcontinued the dreadful treatment of the Irish, while also abolishing amusements,the arts, fun, laughter, and affection. This is how the Puritans interpreted theBible. Laughter and happiness were a sin. They remind me of those signs you seesometimes in comic stories which say: No dancing, no singing, no laughing, nonuffin’. They accepted and expanded upon the beliefs of Calvinism, and theypromoted the extraordinary claims that war and conflict were signs of spiritualsalvation, because it was evidence of the struggle to remove Satan from theEarth. Peace meant that Satan was not being challenged! Such thinking governedBritain at this time and would, as we have seen, also be exported to Americawith the Puritan ‘pilgrims’. After Cromwell died in 1658, Parliament invited theexiled son of Charles I to take the throne as Charles II on the understandingthat there would be religious tolerance. He agreed, but then began a reign ofpersecution against the Puritans and those who didn’t worship the AnglicanFaith. Tens of thousands of Nonconformists were killed, tortured, or shipped offas slaves to the colonies. In Scotland they still call this period the KillingTime. What Charles II really wanted to do was return Britain to the RomanCatholic Faith.This story of Britain is the story of the world. It was going on everywhere withone faith persecuting another over the interpretation of a flawed and largelyinvented book. Almost everything emerged from religion or the battle againstreligious tyranny. The two political parties at the time were divided onreligious lines. The Tories (now Conservatives) were Anglicans while the Whigswere largely Nonconformists. Through these decades of terrible religiousintolerance and unrepresentative parliaments, many individuals made theircontributions to human consciousness. Isaac Newton made several importantscientific discoveries. He studied astronomy and advanced the development of thetelescope. When he saw an apple fall from a tree it triggered a line of thoughtwhich led to his identifying the law of gravity. But he was also very muchinvolved with the Brotherhood as a grand master of the Priory of Sion. Furtherdiscoveries by his successors would undermine the claims of religion. Writerslike John Milton and John Bunyan opposed the behaviour of the Church and state,and Bunyan spent twelve years in Bedford Jail for refusing to accept theAnglican Faith. George Fox founded the Society of Friends (Quakers). He arguedagainst the Church dictatorship and urged toleration, mercy and peace. TheQuakers have largely been the acceptable face of religion, opposing slavery andpersecution. Fox was jailed for blasphemy and thousands of his supporterssuffered the same fate.The Whigs were behind the next ‘coup’ on the British people. When Charles IIdied in 1685, his brother, James II began a bloody three year reign of terrorwhich failed in its avowed attempt to restore Papal power to Britain when he wasoverthrown by the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688. The Whigs, a powerful group ofEnglish and Scottish Protestants, may have been a British political party, laterto become the Liberals, but they were actually based in Holland. They had closelinks with the Dutch House of Orange and with William, Prince of Orange, who hadmarried Mary, the daughter of James II. The House of Orange, like the Germanroyal family, often used marriage to expand its power and effect bloodlesstakeovers of other countries. Another branch of the Brotherhood was set up toput William on the British throne. It was called the Orange Order and this stillcontinues, particularly in Northern Ireland. It is one of the secret societieswhich fuelled the fires of the Northern Ireland conflict. The Orange Order waspledged to make sure that Britain remained a Protestant country, and it wasbased on the principles of Freemasonry, an order of which William was almostcertainly a member. William was to treat Irish Catholics so badly that thehatred of him there still festers through the generations.He was crowned William III and ruled over both Britain and Holland. His wifebecame Mary II. It was now that the Bank of England was created in the image ofthe Bank of Amsterdam and the Brotherhood control of the financial system took amighty step forward. The Bank of England scheme was presented by WilliamPaterson, a Scot, but the British parliament was not terribly keen on the idea.They were, however, trapped by the Brotherhood. William and Mary had started awar with Catholic France and they orchestrated other conflicts also. These werecosting the country so much of its wealth that Britain was in terrible debt.They could not put up taxes any higher without fear of rebellion, so theyreluctantly accepted the Bank of England which would then issue lots of bits ofpaper representing money that did not exist and charge interest to thegovernment (the people) for doing so. As William Bramley writes in The Gods ofEden:“The standard practice of bankers during that period was to issue notes four orfive times in excess of their precious metals. The Bank of England, however,issued an incredible multiplication of 16⅔rds. The British Government agreed toborrow those notes and honour them as legal money for use in its purchases. Thegovernment accepted this plan because the government was not required to repaythe initial loan, only the interest on the loan. Would not the Bank of Englandlose money on such a deal?”Not at all.“The face value of the loan notes were many times in excess of the value of theactual assets on which the notes were based. The interest on the loan in justone year surpassed the total value of the precious metals of the Bank ofEngland! Specifically, the financiers had put together a total base of £72,000of actual gold and silver. By issuing notes valued at 16⅔ times the base, thebank was able to make a loan of £1,200,000 in paper money. The yearly interestwas 8⅓% which equalled £100,000. This amounted to a profit of £28,000, or 39% injust one year!”And who paid for that, and still pays for this system of legalised theft today?The people. In toil, sweat, and suffering. Another Scot, John Law, an agent ofthe Brotherhood, would later become the Finance Minister of France. He set up asimilar central bank there with disastrous consequences for the economy when toomany notes were issued and they subsequently became worth less money. More ofthem were required to buy goods and services and this is the nightmare calledinflation.With the death of William, his wife’s sister Anne took the throne. She wassucceeded by the German House of Hanover, from which the House of Windsor,Britain’s present royal family, descends. The first Hanoverian King, George I,couldn’t even speak English! The Hanoverians were not welcomed by the people whocould not see why Germans should be on the British throne. This allowed theHouse of Hanover to work a nice little earner. They refused to have a largeBritish army, because they said they feared a coup given their unpopularity. Andso they enlisted mercenary soldiers from their German homeland at a massive costto the British people and at a large profit to themselves.At least religious persecution now began to diminish. It would not disappear,but it would start to fade. It took nearly another hundred years for RomanCatholics to be allowed to worship in public and the Irish had to wait for thisright until 1829. The legal prejudice against Nonconformist Protestants lastedeven longer. They were not allowed to sit in Parliament until 1828 and theAnglican Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were only opened to them in 1871.The Pope’s control of Britain was removed by Henry VIII and his daughter,Elizabeth I. Now the power of the monarchs to rule as the representative of Godwas similarly curtailed, as parliaments took over Government. But these weregrossly unrepresentative parliaments and there was little liberation for themasses. You will identify many themes running through this very brief history.One is that those who fight for change in the name of freedom often have noregard for the freedom of others once they are in power. Catholics persecutedProtestants only for Protestants to persecute them when the opportunity arose.You still see this in tit-for-tat killings in today’s trouble spots. The gentrycampaigned for parliamentary freedom and the end of royal dictatorship, only todeny democratic and human rights to those who might vote them out of power. Theparliamentary gentry ran the country for themselves, the Church, and, althoughmany will not have realised it, the Brotherhood.Most people were in grinding poverty. There were no schools although the moneycould always be found to fight wars of acquisition and to build churches. Liveswere hard and short while Britain’s privileged grew richer and the empireexpanded. This continued into the 19th century. Boys and girls of five werebeing forced to work up to ninety hours a week and were often beaten if theyfell asleep. Starving children were left to die in the gutter. They were sent upchimneys to clean them and, together with women, worked down the mines earningmoney for the Anglican Church. The Church received royalties on the profits ofmany pits and in Northumberland and Durham alone this was earning them £400,000a year. This is still a lot of money today, but then it was a staggering sum. Nowonder the Church hierarchy never complained at the treatment of the children,women and miners. It was left to radicals who were often non-believers to puthumanity and compassion ahead of religious doctrine. Not so the Church. As longas the poor wretches had agreed to be baptised, they were saved for alleternity, so why bother trying to improve their lot on Earth? What was happeningto them was God’s will.At one time 223 offences were punishable by death, including stealing ahandkerchief or anything worth over five shillings. Edmund Burke, the Whigpolitician and philosopher, reckoned it was possible to get anything throughparliament that carried the death penalty. People, including children, wereflogged in the streets and hanged in public. It was only in the 1960s thatBritain abolished the death penalty. Many countries and some American statescontinue to indulge in this barbarism. Into the 19th century wives were stillbeing sold to the highest bidder in British markets and the treatment of womenin general was shocking in its inhumanity. The prisons were full of ‘debtors’ –people who could not afford to feed their families. The poor people couldn’t goto law to fight their case, because the legal system was there primarily toprovide an income for the legal profession – and control the people. It hadnothing to do with justice. Widows and children of the poor were thrown out oftheir homes when their husbands or parents died. Beggars filled the streets.This was the world which 1,500 years of Christianity had visited upon Britainand the rest of Christendom. And where were the shouts of protest from theChurch? Silence.Into the last century, Christendom was no further advanced than the Babylonianshad been 5,000 years earlier. When Robert Raikes began to organise schools toteach children to read and write on Sundays (their only day off) the AnglicanChurch opposed them because some of the teachers were Nonconformists. In the19th century Hannah More was prosecuted by an Ecclesiastical Court for herattempts at educating people. The clergy believed that everything anyone neededto know was in the Bible and they also realised that education was bad news forthem. If people started to think for themselves it was goodbye Church power. Abill of 1807 to introduce state education which was passed by the House ofCommons was blocked by the Bishops in the House of Lords. This when only one inseventeen people in England could write. The efforts of other reformers likeJoseph Lancaster to educate the young so frightened the Church that it began totake an interest in schools. It knew these non-believing reformers would insiston the teaching of knowledge and reason, not theology. Once the Church realisedthat education was now inevitable, it wanted to gain control of the curriculum.Still today in England we have Church of England controlled schools in someareas with the local vicar on the Board of Governors. The Bishops in the Houseof Lords also opposed every Reform Bill designed to widen the franchise and givepeople a greater say in who governs them. They even opposed legislation toabolish the death penalty for thefts of more than five shillings. The ChristianChurch civilised the world??The credibility of the Church was fatally breached during the Victorian era inBritain which accelerated the emergence of scientific explanations for what hadhitherto been explained by ludicrous theology. The Church was now fighting arearguard action trying to stay upright as the ground slipped beneath its feet.Tradition and the close links of Church and state maintained its privileges andinfluence and this continues to the present day, but its power to dictate wasfading.Unfortunately, most of the scientists who were undermining religion’scredibility with their claims and discoveries, people like Charles Darwin andcountless others, were going too far in the other direction. They didn’trealise, and most of their successors still don’t, that the evolution of thephysical body and that of the eternal us, the consciousness which activates thephysical body, are not the same. We were now being offered a choice between theridiculous contentions of Christianity which were fast losing ground, and thematerialist scientists who claimed that the physical world is all that existsand life after death is a myth. This view, which to me is as equally bereft ofcredibility as religion, remains the stance of the scientific establishment tothis day, though not for much longer. It was also exactly what the Brotherhoodelite wanted to happen as a key part of its New World Order. A world without Godor belief in an eternal self was its ambition, even though it knew and knows thetruth of who we really are. Religion would continue to be used when appropriate,but the aim was really to replace that with the view of a godless science in theminds of the people.“It is with this object in view that we are constantly, by means of our press,arousing a blind confidence in these (scientific) theories. The intellectuals ofthe Goyim will puff themselves up with their knowledge and without any logicalverification of it will put into affect all the information available fromscience, which our agentur specialists have cunningly pieced together for thepurpose of educating their minds in the direction we want. Do not suppose for amoment that these statements are empty words: think carefully of the successeswe arranged for Darwinism . . . .” (Protocol 2).“. . . . It is indispensible to undermine all faith, to tear out of the minds ofthe Goyim the very principle of Godhead and the spirit, and to put in its placearithmetical calculations and material needs.” (Protocol 4).Are you listening university lecturers, science students and establishmentscientists? You have been and continue to be duped. The British Prime Minister,Benjamin Disraeli, could see some of what was going on when he said this in theHouse of Commons in July 1856:“There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention in this House. I mean thesecret societies …. It is useless to deny, because it is impossible to concealthat a great part of Europe, the whole of Italy and France, and a great part ofGermany, to say nothing of other countries, is covered with a network of secretsocieties, just as the surfaces of the earth are covered with railroads. Andwhat are their objects? …. They do not want constitutional government, they donot want ameliorated institutions …. they want to change the tenure of the land,to drive out the present owners of the soil, and put an end to theecclesiastical establishments. Some may even go further.”One of the groups in Italy he was referring to was the Mafia. GiuseppeGaribaldi, a thirty-third degree Mason and Grand Master of Italy, had led therebellion in the Italian wars of unification. The Mafia, up until then a secretsociety resisting foreign rule in Sicily, supported him. The Mafia formed anunderground government in Sicily and used criminal acts to undermine the foreignoccupation. When Italy was unified, the Mafia became the underground terroristand criminal movement it is today. One of the most notorious freemason lodgeswas also based in Italy. It was known as P2 and it controlled the Vatican.We saw our familiar theme at work again in these Victorian and Edwardian times.The science which had for so long been suppressed and crushed by the Church, waswinning its freedom to research and discover knowledge which the priests wouldrather have remained hidden. But, when open-minded scientists found evidence tochallenge the materialist this-world-is-all-there-is view of the establishmentscientists, their work was likewise suppressed and crushed by their owncolleagues. Instead of one powerful interest group suggesting that reincarnationand eternal life for everyone did not exist, now there were two. The last thingthe Brotherhood wanted was for the population to know the spiritual truths.Both ‘science’ and religion were fierce in their opposition to the growth ininterest in Spiritualism during the Victorian era. Mediums were, until 1951,liable to a fine and imprisonment for the crime of being a medium, but their artbegan to return to public attention thanks to the emergence of Spiritualism. Thelaw of the land incorporated the Church’s contention that contact with the‘dead’ was impossible and therefore anyone claiming to do so must by definitionbe a fraud. Little did the people know that Queen Victoria had a medium workingwith her for many years after the death of her husband, Albert, the PrinceConsort. Arthur Findlay revealed the story for the first time in The Curse ofIgnorance in 1947. He was given the details by the daughter of James Robert Leeswho, as a thirteen year old boy, was found to have outstanding psychic gifts.One communicator who claimed to be the entity who had been Prince Albert askedto be allowed to speak to Victoria.The Queen, who had been grief-stricken by his death, heard of this and sentalong two members of her court to investigate. They posed as members of thepublic who wanted to see what the boy could do. He began to channel PrinceAlbert, who proceeded to greet the two courtiers by their correct names and saidhe knew they had been sent by Victoria. He gave them information for the Queenthat only he could have known. He also wrote a letter to her through the hand ofRobert Lees, a process called automatic writing. The contents greatly impressedthe Queen, and Robert was invited to meet her and channel Albert in herpresence. She was not in the least fazed by all this, because she hadexperienced sittings with other mediums before the Prince’s death. She invitedRobert to become a permanent member of her court where he could channel herhusband whenever she wished. But Albert said he could communicate through theson of a worker on her Balmoral estate, a man called John Brown. He wassummoned, and a long relationship began between John and the Queen. Through him,Albert would advise her throughout the rest of her life. When John Brown diedthe Queen wrote about him and intended to publish her work, but she waspersuaded not to do so by her Private Secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, and by Dr.Davidson, the Dean of Windsor and later Archbishop of Canterbury. He had longopposed her interest in Spiritualism and threatened to resign as Court Chaplainif she published anything about John Brown. Ponsonby also destroyed Brown’sprivate diaries to make sure the truth was never revealed.Spiritualism, the belief in the ability to communicate with discarnate souls,had begun in the United States in the mid-1800s and spread to Europe. In Britainit had a number of famous advocates including the scientists Sir Oliver Lodge,Sir William Crookes, and Sir William Barrett, and the writers Victor Hugo andSir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The scientistswere dismissed by their fellows, but they had begun to understand the nature ofvibrations and how many worlds could share the same space. Conan Doyle dedicatedhis later life to the cause of Spiritualism at a time when the escapologist,Houdini, was running a virtual witch-hunt against mediums in the United States.In 1938, a committee appointed by the Church reported favourably on itsinvestigations into Spiritualism, but Dr Lang the Archbishop of Canterburyrefused to publish it. He was, however, quite happy to pass into the publicarena the report of another committee at that time which supported belief in theAnglican Church’s Thirty-nine Articles of Faith. As twenty-one of thetwenty-five members of the committee were priests we should not be surprised attheir verdict. If only Victoria and others had stood up and revealed theirexperiences and beliefs, the suppression of knowledge by Church and sciencewould have been broken by now. Instead it is left to our generations to do it.The movement and religion of Spiritualism deserves great credit for keeping theunderstandings alive in the face of tremendous opposition from the Church andmaterialist science. The scientists became dominant in the public mind, andalthough medicine progressed enormously in its understanding, it, too, failed toacknowledge that there is more to the human being than a physical body. Againthe materialist view held sway in medicine and the foundations of the‘tradition’ thus created are still with us today. The most important advances inhuman health were the improvement in sanitation and water supplies, althoughatrocious poverty and terrible living conditions remained the lot of themajority. This was despite the increasing wealth of the rich and the country ingeneral gained through the exploitation of the people and the Empire. In thisperiod from Victoria to the present day the world would discover the means ofmass production; electricity; radio; television; the telephone; the aeroplane;spacecraft; the list goes on and on. The freedom of many human minds from thereligious thought-police unleashed so much potential – more than the public havebeen told about, as we shall discuss later. But cleverness is one thing, wisdomquite another. The invention of the steam engine revolutionised production andthe exploitation of oil would give us the petrol engine. All over the worldinventions and discoveries were coming to light which changed the nature ofwork, life and the potential for both construction and catastrophe. I will lookat the economic and environmental consequences of this in chapter 11, but here Iwish to expand on the difference between cleverness and wisdom.To unlock the secrets of nature’s potential is clever, but it takes wisdom to(a) use that knowledge for positive and constructive purposes and (b) to havethe humility to appreciate that there is always, but always, a great deal moreto know. As Socrates said: “Wisdom is knowing how little we know”. The scientistCarl Sagan was also correct when he pointed out that intellectual capacity is noguarantee against being dead wrong. The Victorian and post-Victorian world hasnot understood that and humility has rarely been a feature of the humancondition among those in power. So the true nature of life and Creation went onbeing ignored by the Church and the scientific establishment, even thoughSocrates and Plato had known the basis of it in Ancient Greece. Clevernesswithout wisdom is also the bringer of war. Wise people would have used andexpanded their gathering knowledge for the benefit of all, and by that I don’tmean only those in their own country. All means all. Instead the collective mindof humanity was still reacting like a spoilt child being guided along adestructive path by the Illuminati elite.Whatever is the dominating belief of the collective mind can have an enormousinfluence on the way individuals think. Unfortunately, as we have seen, thebehaviour of Church, Brotherhood and State over the period covered in this bookhas programmed the collective consciousness to pass on its responsibility tothink and act to others – the Pope, priests, kings and queens, dictators,gentry, bosses, the Bible, the Koran, whoever and whatever they can find.Humanity in general has been programmed to think and behave like robots and toindoctrinate their children to do the same. This they have done. When you lookat all the slaughter, the invasions and counter-invasions, the bloodypersecutions over minute differences in the same religious faith, the mass ofthe people never benefited from any of them. When a place was plundered by anarmy, the proceeds and the power didn’t go to them, but to those they blindlyfollowed and, increasingly, to those they didn’t even know about. People maybelieve those days are over, but they’re not, you know. There is still anenormous amount to do to free the human mind from subservience andindoctrination. Through the Victorian period while reforms were won bycourageous and compassionate people under fierce opposition by the Church andother self-interest groups, the old beliefs were still there.The tribes had become communities, then states, and now they had formed togetherinto countries and nations. The way they came together was no foundation fortheir future peace and stability. Often it was the result of one religion orbelief being imposed upon everyone through Brotherhood-inspired invasion orcivil war, and the resentment simmered away until the oppressed could get theirrevenge, encouraged by other Brotherhood groups. Everyone believed that theywere doing what was right without realising that a higher, secret force waspulling their strings and taking advantage of their sense of injustice. Someparts of Europe changed hands so many times they must have woken up in themorning and asked who was in charge that day. Among these political and militaryrugby balls were Bosnia, Serbia, Herzegovina and Montenegro, and the bitterresentment at this and each other has exploded again in this decade in aterrible religious and ethnic war. The Turks, Greeks, Germans, French, Italians,Spanish, British, Dutch, Russians, anyone with sufficient military muscle,fought and squabbled with each other over who should add different countries orregions to their empires of exploitation. School children arguing over sweetswould have shown more maturity. The resentments and impositions this created arethe cause of many ongoing conflicts and simmering feuds, in the Middle East,Europe, and elsewhere.By the end of the 19th century this powder keg had to blow, and it did in aseries of conflicts leading to the two World Wars. And the knowledge gained bymaterialist science was used to create weapons with a greater destructivepotential than ever before."},{"pageContent":"10The World at WarIN the early years of the 20th century, Brotherhood bankers and industrialistswere expanding their control of the world financial system.Two names were particularly prominent, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. TheRockefellers are one of America’s best-known families. They became famous afterJohn Davidson Rockefeller and his brother, William, made their fortune with thehighly-controversial Standard Oil Company with its web of financialwheeler-dealing which no-one could fathom. J.D. Rockefeller’s grandson, Nelson,would become a Vice-President of the United States and play a leading partbehind the scenes, too, in the course of US politics.The Rothschilds are a European banking dynasty started by Mayer AmschelRothschild who was born in Germany in 1744. The name comes from the red (rot)shield on the house in a ghetto in which Mayer’s ancestors once lived. By 1820,the Rothschild empire had branches in London, Paris, Vienna and Naples. Theymade vast profits from the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars of 1792 to1815 and had a very significant influence on the course of European history.They diversified into railways, coal and other industrial investments. TheRothschilds are well known for their enthusiastic support of Freemasonry. MayerAmschel Rothschild summed up the approach of the Brotherhood bankers and theIlluminati elite when he said: “Give me control over a nation’s currency, and Icare not who makes the laws.”The Rockefeller and Rothschild empires will feature in the story from now on,but I want to stress most emphatically that I will be highlighting certainindividual people and the way in which the empires have been used. I do not wishto suggest that everyone called Rockefeller or Rothschild is involved. Most ofthem will not know what is going on either.At the centre of the gathering empire of the banking and industrial elite wasthe Round Table. This had been founded, quite possibly with the best ofintentions, by an Englishman, Cecil Rhodes, after whom Rhodesia was named beforeits independence. Supported by the Rothschild empire, he made a colossal fortuneexploiting the diamond reserves and resources of South Africa. Rhodes oftenexpressed a desire to stop wars by creating a world government, centred onBritain, which could intervene in disputes before they became violent. In 1891he set up his now infamous Round Table which was obviously inspired by the KingArthur stories. It was designed on Brotherhood lines with secret rituals, innerand outer circles, and much of the other paraphernalia of such organisations.Among the supporters of the Round Table were Lord Rothschild, head of theRothschild empire in England, and another English banker, Alfred Milner. But itwas after Rhodes died* in 1902 that the big switch was made and the Illuminati,in classic fashion, hijacked his creation.The international Brotherhood bankers began to give the Round Table substantialfinancial support and these backers included the Rockefellers. The Round Tablewas used to coordinate the activities of central banks and Brotherhood bankersacross the world and to increase enormously their influence on governments. TheTable created other branches to further, and also to mask, its activities. AdamWeishaupt, a German professor who started a famous branch of the Illuminati in1776, said: “The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let itnever appear in its own name, but always covered by another name, anotheroccupation.” These ‘front’ organisations were to include the Council on ForeignRelations in the United States, and, in the British Empire, the Royal Instituteof International Affairs. Both were created to direct the foreign policy ofgovernments to suit Brotherhood ambitions. David Rockefeller was chairman of theCouncil on Foreign Relations for many years. Today it has infiltrated its peopleand policies throughout United States government. This Brotherhood illuminatielite began to infiltrate the universities and the media, and this is nowwidespread. It controls the media, for sure. Dr Carrol Quigley wrote of thistime:“There grew up in the 20th century a power structure between London and New Yorkwhich penetrated deeply into university life, the Press, and the practice offoreign policy. In England the centre was the Round Table group, while in theUnited States it was J.P. Morgan and Company, or its local branches in Boston,Philadelphia, and Cleveland.”The aim of the Brotherhood banking and political network was to create a worldfinancial system in which the central banks and other private banking interestswould work together. They would coordinate their activities to controlgovernments and economies by creating booms and busts, manipulating foreignexchanges and bribing politicians with well-paid jobs in the financial world.You can see all of these things happening daily every time you pick up anewspaper. The centre of this banking network was to be the Bank forInternational Settlements, based in Basle, Switzerland. Much of the manipulationof the world is coordinated from Switzerland so it is no mystery why thatcountry is never invaded during Brotherhood-engineered wars. For Swiss‘neutrality’ see ‘protecting Brotherhood asset’s and interests’. Theoverwhelming aim of this banking cartel was to create a situation in whichgovernments were so deeply in debt to them that they had to do as the bankersdemanded. Like lambs to the slaughter, governments all over the world havefallen for it, or, through Brotherhood channels, helped to arrange it, theUnited States more than anyone.The idea of a central bank inventing money that doesn’t exist has long beencontroversial in America. Two of its founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson andJames Madison, wanted any such bank to be under government control. They couldsee the dangers of any other system. But another, Alexander Hamilton, wasdetermined to create a Central Bank in private hands. His backers were reputedto be the Bank of England and the Rothschilds. By 1786, the US was plunged intoits first major economic depression caused by the lending and interest policiesof the money-out-of-nothing banks, including Hamilton’s own Bank of New York.Heavy taxes were levied on the population to pay for the interest on bank loansto the federal government and the state authorities. Farmers were ruined by thebanks and Captain Daniel Shay led two thousand desperate farmers to take over anumber of towns in Massachusetts, most famously Worcester. They wanted an end tointerest banking, but Shay’s Rebellion, as it was termed, was put down.When George Washington became President in 1789, he made Hamilton the Secretaryto the Treasury. Two years later, Hamilton got his way when the Bank of theUnited States, the new nation’s first central bank, opened its doors. It wasprivately owned, but the Government entrusted to it the country’s finances. Onlyfive years later, the taxes imposed on the people were so high, to pay theinterest on borrowing from this bank, that farmers again rebelled, this time inwestern Pennsylvania. This so-called Whisky Rebellion was crushed on the ordersof George Washington. The Bank of the United States lost its power in the 1830swhen President Andrew Jackson won his ‘bank war’ against Nicholas Biddle, thepresident of the bank. But, early in the next century, this would be replaced bytoday’s Federal Reserve system, the private banking network that controls the USeconomy for its own benefit.President Woodrow Wilson came to office in 1909 and one of his close aides was aman called Colonel Edward House. It was House who actually controlled events andhis masters were the Brotherhood banking interests, not the American people. Hisbrief from the bankers was to ensure that the administration introduced theFederal Reserve system and the income tax bill known as the Federal Income TaxAmendment (the 16th Amendment to the American Constitution). This combinationwould be the means of controlling the US economy. The Federal Reserve would lendthe government enormous amounts of largely-invented money to boost the economyand, when it suited the bankers, the Federal Income Tax Amendment would suppressthe economy by raising taxation. The manner in which both were introduced raisedmuch criticism. President Wilson must have had some idea of what was going onbehind the scenes. He once talked of “A power so organised, so complete, sopersuasive, that they had better not speak above their breaths when they speakin condemnation of it.”Persuading people to do what you want them to do, while believing they are doingthe opposite is a method constantly used by the Brotherhood. The Federal ReserveBill was painted as a measure to curtail the power of banking interests andthose same publicly opposed the idea to add to the conjuring trick. The plot washatched at a meeting of Illuminati bankers and industrialists at Jekyll Island,Georgia, towards the end of 1910. The location of the meeting was extremelysymbolic in that, while the Brotherhood was playing Dr Jekyll, it was really MrHyde. The Federal Reserve Bill was pushed through Congress in the last few daysbefore Christmas 1913 and Congressman Charles A Lindbergh, senior, the father ofthe aviator, recognised the sleight of hand for what it was. He said that thefinancial insiders had only opposed the Federal Reserve legislation because theywished to promote the fiction that it was a ‘People’s Bill’. He added:“This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth……When the President signsthis Act, the invisible government by the money power, proven to exist by theMoney Trust Investigation will be legalised. The new law will create inflationwhenever the trust wants inflation.“The Federal Reserve was, and still is, hailed as a victory for democracy overthe Money Trust. Nothing could be further from the truth. The whole Central Bankconcept was engineered by the very group it was supposed to strip of power.”The Federal Reserve system has refused to be audited since the day it wasformed. It is so important for everyone to lift their eyes from what appears tobe a certain situation, because this type of double bluff is being used all thetime to make us act in the interests of the Illuminati, while thinking we aredoing the opposite. When the plan was first presented by the Republicans it wasrejected by Congress. There was a feeling in the public mind that theRepublicans were too close to banking interests. The Brotherhood had an answerfor that. They got the Democrats to present it and it was passed! Only twostates agreed to the Federal Income Tax Amendment and it required at leastthirty-six if it was to be legally ratified. When this was obviously not goingto happen, the Secretary of State, Filander Knox, simply told Congress in 1913that the amendment had been ratified, even though it had not. From that moment,all the income tax paid under the Act through the Internal Revenue Service hasbeen purely voluntary (although everyone is told it’s the law) and all the moneythat people have been forced to pay by the IRS has been a theft! The IRS is aprivate organisation controlling the federal tax system of America, and it is aBrotherhood tool*. The financial network, led by the Rothschilds, theRockefellers and others, was now in place for the biggest Brotherhood project sofar – the First World War.In the first years of this century a number of secret, mystical societies inGermany began to promote the idea of a master race. They claimed the white Aryanrace was superior to all the others and said the Germans were a part of that.The myth of the German Aryan master race had begun. An English-born writer,Houston Stewart Chamberlain, was a great supporter of this view. He believedthat Germany could breed a super-race to lead Europe into a New Order. He wasfiercely anti-Jewish.Wilhelm II, the Kaiser of Germany, was another religious fanatic who believed hewas God’s representative on Earth. He was an avid reader of Chamberlain’s workand met him to discuss their mutual belief that Germans were God’s chosen peopleand should rule the whole of Europe, if not the world. He dismissed hisChancellor, Bismark, in 1890 and assumed control of the country. You would havethought the people would have resisted this but, once again, we see theconsequences of human dependence on someone else to tell them what to do, whichhad been part of life for centuries. Wilhelm prepared for war. The PrussianHohenzollern dynasty, of which Wilhelm was a member, had been encouraging theunification of Germany and building up its war machine for many years. There wasan outbreak of conflicts around Europe rather like musical chairs. Allianceswere agreed on religious and political grounds but, mostly, countries werelooking around for allies to support them in the increasingly-likely event ofattack. Wilhelm was waiting for any excuse to make his play for Europeandomination, and it came in 1914. The mutual dislike between Austria and Serbiacame to a head when the Archduke Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarianthrone, was assassinated in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The Austrians accusedthe Serbs of involvement in the murder and sent an ultimatum. The Serbs agreedto all but two of its demands, and asked for those to be decided by arbitration.But the Austrians and Germans wanted a fight and Austria declared war on Serbia.Russia supported Serbia. Who actually killed Ferdinand to create the spark forwhat followed? A Serbian secret society called the Black Hand. Count Czerin, afriend of Ferdinand, said, “The Archduke knew quite well that the risk of anattempt on his life was imminent. A year before the war he informed me that thefreemasons had resolved on his death”.Wilhelm declared war on Russia and France. His idea was that Germany would win aswift battle with France before turning its full might on Russia. The Germansinvaded Belgium and entered France from the north. Britain declared war onGermany and the bloodiest conflict in human history was underway. Germany didn’twin the quick victory over the French she had hoped for. It became a war ofattrition in the trenches of Northern France. There, in the mud and desolation,European manhood died in its millions to win or defend a few acres of devastatedland. Scientific knowledge was used to improve the efficiency with whichhumanity slaughtered each other, and never had this been achieved on a greaterscale than this. The battles are written in the memory forever of anyone whowishes to see an end to the stupidity and manipulation that has divertedhumankind from its true purpose. Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, saw millionskilled on both sides, often in suicidal assaults on well-fortified trenches, onthe orders of insane generals.Turkey entered the war on Germany’s side, but Italy supported Britain on thepromise of being given Trentino and Trieste. They opened a front againstAustria, while Britain was becoming increasingly stretched by the need tosupport the French Western Front and protect her interests in India and Egyptfrom the Turks. It was now that T.E. Lawrence, ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, organised arevolt by the Arabs against the Turks. The British went on to occupy Palestine,Jerusalem and Mesopotamia. The courage and determination of the Russian peoplein defending their land from the Germans, at a cost of four million casualties,had done much to stretch the German resources and reduce their ability to breakthrough in France. But, in 1917, they agreed a peace treaty with Germany afterthe Russian revolution or, rather, the Russian Brotherhood Revolution.There had been riots and unrest for a long time over the often cruel persecutionof the people by the Tsars. There were strikes and mutinies in the Russian army,and Tsar Nicholas II was taken to Siberia where he and his family were executedby a bunch of extreme revolutionaries who were no more enlightened in theirhumanity than the Tsars they removed. The more moderate reformers were castaside by the followers of Lenin and Trotsky. They abolished plans for aparliamentary constitution and imposed upon an already oppressed people theCommunist State which replaced Tsarist fascism with state fascism. This had allthe same economic and political flaws of the capitalism it so despised. It wascapitalism under another name and with greater control of the economy. Oneextreme is invariably followed by another, because of the absence of wisdom.Anyone who wins control and power by violence shows themselves unfit to governanyone. If they will use violence to win power they will use violence againstthe people to keep it. Violence is not something you can switch on and off. Itis either in your psyche or it is not.So who was really behind this ‘Revolution of the People’? Freemasonry was at theheart of it. Coil’s Masonic Encyclopaedia says that there was a Supreme MasonicCouncil in Russia with forty subordinate groups at the start of the war. TsarAlexander had become so concerned at the agenda of Russian freemasonry that hehad banned it in August 1822 when its own Grand Master had warned him that itwas a threat to the state and should be stopped or reorganised. You can see thatthe Brotherhood does not speak only with one voice. Playing one against theother is all part of the strategy. This decree was renewed by Tsar Nicholas but,as freemasonry is a secret society, the subversion went on. It was right thatthe Tsar’s abuse of power should end but, again, it is the secret agenda behindthis that we have to watch.The Germans naturally supported Lenin and gave him safe passage in a sealedtrain across Germany from Switzerland on his way to Russia, because they wantedhim to withdraw the Russians from the war. They also gave him and his Bolshevikrevolutionaries tens of thousands of marks for propaganda and to make sure therevolution succeeded. What a surprise, then, that after Lenin’s coup against theprovisional ‘people’s government’ the Russians pulled out of the war and allowedthe Germans to concentrate on other fronts! The Communists were supported byGerman and other Western bankers and financiers. The German banker, Max Warburg,supported Lenin’s regime. So did the American banker, Jacob Schiff. His familyoriginated in Germany where it had enjoyed close links with the Rothschildbanking empire, the key financial supporter of this and the other revolutions.The father of modern Communism and of the beliefs which the Bolsheviks promotedis said to be Karl Marx, who died in 1883. He was a member of a Brotherhoodorganisation, the League of the Just (later the Communist League), an offshootof the Society of the Seasons which played a major part in the French Revolutionalong with their Grand Orient Lodge in Paris. The German industrialist,Friedrich Engels, supported Marx and wrote with him the Communist Manifesto onbehalf of the secret societies which were behind them. Fifteen internationalbankers used the cover of a Red Cross mission in 1917 to travel to Petrograd tosupport the original revolution, the provisional ‘people’s government’, and theBolsheviks who would replace it. Professor Stuart Crane pointed out the scam:“If you look back at every war in Europe……you will see that they always endedwith the establishment of a balance of power. With every reshuffling there was abalance of power in a new grouping around the House of Rothschild in England,France, or Austria. They grouped nations so that if any king got out of line, awar would break out and the war would be decided by which way the financingwent. Researching the debt positions of the warring nations will usuallyindicate who was being punished.”Or as the Illuminati Protocols put it in the 1800s:“Throughout all Europe, and by means of relations with Europe, in othercontinents also, we must create ferments, discords and hostility. Therein wegain a double advantage. In the first place we keep in check all countries, forthey well know that we have the power whenever we like to create disorders or torestore order . . . . In the second place, by our intrigues we shall tangle upall the threads which we have stretched into the cabinets of all states by meansof politics, by economic treaties, or loan obligations. In order to succeed inthis we must use great cunning and penetration during negotiations andagreements, but, as regards what is called the ‘official language’ we shall keepto the opposite tactics and assume the mask of honesty and compliancy . . . . Wemust be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with theneighbours of that country which dares to oppose us: but if these neighboursshould also venture to stand collectively against us, then we must offerresistance by a universal war.” (Protocol 7)Communism was a form of designer politics created by the Brotherhood as anopposition to the ‘free’ society of America and Europe. Millions of dollars ofBrotherhood money* was poured into the Russian revolution because the fear of aRussian ‘bogeyman’ was going to be used when the time was right. Russia became abogeyman on ice waiting to be exploited thirty years later. Its beliefs inworkers as units of production and people without spirit in a godless world wasexactly what the Brotherhood wished the masses to believe.The secret societies of the Brotherhood had taken control of the intelligenceagencies that had emerged since the 17th century and so it was with the Tsaristintelligence agency, the Okhrana. There is a great illusion that the secretservices of the world are set up in opposition to each other when, in fact, atthe highest level, well above anyone known to the public, they work largely asone unit. Even the lower levels of these agencies don’t realise that, but theyare stooges for the Brotherhood, too. Intelligence agencies are organisations(the Brotherhood) within organisations. There is a secret world government whichis continually destabilising and directing the actions of nation states. Intypical Brotherhood fashion, Lenin and the Bolsheviks were attacking the Tsarfor the brutality of the Okhrana while, behind the scenes, the Okhrana weresupporting the Lenin revolution! The Okhrana were supplying funds andundermining the revolutionary opposition to the Bolsheviks, while many of themain protagonists within the Bolshevik movement were its members. The soon-to-beSoviet dictator, Josef Stalin, was, at the very least, extremely close to theOkhrana, probably a member. The first editor of the Communist mouthpiece,Pravda, was from there.It is no surprise, therefore, that when Lenin and his supporters came to power,the intelligence agency they apparently so hated and condemned was greatlyexpanded and given a change of name – from Okhrana to the KGB. The revolution ofthe people was just another ball and chain in disguise. There was a considerableJewish flavour to the revolution, and the Brotherhood was now preparing theground for a return of the Jews to Palestine. Some research I have seen claimsthat, of 388 members of the Russian Revolutionary Government in 1918, onlysixteen were Russians by birth. All but two of the rest were Jews fromelsewhere, mostly from New York. How people have been tricked right through theages to the present day. The Brotherhood was deeply involved in all the‘people’s revolutions’ which exploded after the American War of Independence.This includes, as we have seen, the French Revolution which led to theextermination of at least 100,000 people in the Reign of Terror that followed.The blow for the Allies of losing Russian support against the Germans in WorldWar I was compensated by the arrival of the Americans. President Woodrow Wilsonled them into the war when Germany began a policy of sinking all shipping ofwhatever nationality, or rather that’s what the allies said. The sinking of theAmerican ship, the Lusitania, was simply the excuse President Wilson had beenlooking for to justify entering the war, and I have no doubt that the sinkingwas manufactured by him in collusion with the British. The Japanese attack onPearl Harbor would be used by President Franklin D Roosevelt in the same way inthe Second World War. As Commander Joseph Kenworthy of British NavalIntelligence said:“The Lusitania was deliberately sent at considerably reduced speed into an areawhere a U-boat was known to be waiting and with her escort withdrawn.”The Lusitania was carrying military supplies for Great Britain and was not, asthe Americans claimed, merely a passenger vessel. Slowly, after the US soldiersarrived in Europe, the initiative turned against Germany and Wilhelm surrenderedand abdicated, to be allowed to live out his life in comfort in the Netherlands.With his going, the German monarchy ended. This was the war which had beenfought for the first time with the submarine, aeroplane and tank and this hadtaken everything onto a new level of horror and destruction. By the time itended, tens of millions of men, women and children had lost their lives in a warmanufactured by the Brotherhood for its own purposes. Words just cannot describehow that makes you feel. Germany was ordered to pay reparations to the nationsshe had attacked and agreed to accept strict limitations on the size of herarmed forces. The Austrian Empire was divided into the individual states ofAustria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, an amalgamation of Serbia,Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Dalmatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. The colonies ofthe defeated countries were shared out among the victors under the heading of‘protectorates’. Syria went to France while Britain was handed Palestine, Jordanand Iraq. It’s hard to believe that countries could be passed around like this,but it happened in this century.In Britain, the war had hastened social reform and the widening of thefranchise. After the French Revolution in 1789, the British gentry had been soterrified that it added yet more capital offences to the statute book andimposed even harsher laws against rebellion of any kind. But, when they couldsee their possessions under threat from a foreign power, they began to makeconcessions to the oppressed, because they knew they needed them to defend theirwealth. Also, with every widening of the franchise, the power of the upper classelite was curtailed, though not that of the Brotherhood elite.The rights of all children to an education had to be won in stages againstChurch and factory-owner opposition but, in 1918, came the most importantvictory yet in the form of the Education Act. This ensured a full-time educationfor all children up to the age of fourteen, and ended the practice of childrengoing to work for half the day and school for the rest. It also introducednursery schools and medical checks for children at school. The only sad thingwas that the Church would continue to have a significant say in the education ofchildren with the Bible taught as if it were historical fact. This continueseven today.The most significant development in the years between the wars was the rise ofthe dictator to replace monarchs and fledgling democracies. Here again it showshow desperate are the people for someone to lead them and tell them when tobreathe; how the Brotherhood exploited that! The American President, WoodrowWilson, at the instigation of his Brotherhood representative, Colonel House,proposed an organisation called the League of Nations after the First World War,to arbitrate disputes between countries before they became violent. It was afine idea in theory, but, in practice, it was the first tentative andunsuccessful attempt at a centralised body on which to base a World Government.The Brotherhood is very adept at presenting something in terms that seem highlylaudable, which can brilliantly obscure the hidden agenda. The League of Nationsstruggled into life but quickly collapsed because the American Congress wouldnot join.The support of the Roman Catholic Church for the dictators is not surprising.Its survival depends on the suppression of knowledge and the imposition ofbelief. Here we were in the first thirty-odd years of this century, seeing theexpansion of education, materialistic sciences and more democratic politicalsystems and the Roman Church was getting very worried as support forChristianity fell away. They knew that what they needed was a return to the olddays of repression and oppression when they ran the show. The Vatican has alsobeen run to a larger or lesser extent by the Brotherhood for centuries, probablyfrom the start, and if, by mistake, they elect a Pope who won’t play the game,he conveniently dies, as was the case with Pope John Paul I in 1978. Hissuccessor, Pope John Paul II, appeared to rescind a ban on freemasonry imposedby Pope Clement XII in 1738. Clement at least knew what was going on and wishedto stop it. Today the Vatican position on freemasonry looks very confused andmany Catholics are among the masons’ ranks. In 1978, the year John Paul II tookthe papal throne, a special issue of Vatican stamps featured the triangle andall-seeing eye. Celebrating an Illuminati victory, perhaps?Pope Pius XI and those who controlled the Vatican saw Benito Mussolini as theman who could lead them to a return to past glories. The global financial crashof the 1920s brought great hardship which proved fertile ground for a dictatorto step forward and hoodwink the people into believing he had their bestinterests at heart. Mussolini, the son of a blacksmith, came to power in theaccepted way of dictators, through bribery, corruption, murder and support fromthe secret societies. He was obsessed with restoring the Roman Empire and hisbrand of violence and patriotism were so successful that the king gave himcontrol of the state to avoid a civil war. Once ensconced, he removed alldemocratic rights and freedom of expression. The Roman Catholic Church supportedhim in all of this. He knew that he could have free and constant propaganda fromthe pulpits of Italy if he had the Church on his side. The Vatican City wasgiven independence from Italy, and the Church was given control, once more, ofall education along with a donation of £19 million. When Mussolini invadedAbyssinia the Pope gave him his full support. It was the same when Mussoliniwent for Albania and Greece. Nothing would have delighted the Roman Catholicleaders more than to have control over the lands of the Greek Orthodox Churchthey so hated. These two Christian creeds had parted company, you will recall,after the Pope added the words ‘and from the Son’ (the Filoque) to the Christiancreed in 1054. Many Christians refused to accept this so they formed thebreakaway Orthodox Church which later looked on Moscow as its own particularRome or Mecca. Seventy thousand Jews were banished from Italy by Mussoliniwithout a single word of protest from the Vatican. Italy was now controlled by adouble dictatorship of Church and State, and both of them were controlled by theBrotherhood.The Pope was also on friendly terms with Adolf Hitler after a large RomanCatholic vote swept him to power in Germany in 1933. Germany was in a desperatestate, a country in physical and economic ruin after the war. With the end ofthe monarchy, a republic was declared at a meeting at Weimar in 1919, but it wasalways struggling against Communist, royalist, far right, and Brotherhoodopposition. Most of all, it was destroyed by a collapsed economy. But then, ifyou control the financial system, undermining a country to prepare the groundfor a revolution is no problem. The 1929 Wall Street crash in the United Stateswas similarly engineered. The Brotherhood bankers created inflation andencouraged the stock market to overstretch itself, so making a crash inevitable.All the stock markets of the world are manipulated in this way. The Depressionof the 1920s was the time of the ‘Turkey Shoot’, as it was known. By 1921, therewere 31,076 banks in the U.S. The giant banks of the Brotherhood elite decidedit was time to reap their harvest. The Federal Reserve announced a series of newregulations which they realised the smaller banks could not meet in such bleakeconomic conditions. This forced thousands of them out of business – 16,000failed in eleven years. The Brotherhood bankers had destroyed the competition.They increased their own assets by absorbing the failed small fry and all thosein debt to them. The Federal Reserve, having achieved its task, then reduced thetoughness of the regulations. Franklin D Roosevelt, with support from theseelite bankers, announced his famous New Deal policy to lift the U.S. out ofdepression. This involved the government borrowing enormous sums from thebankers and the debt of government and population exploded again. CongressmanLouis McFadden, a Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, saidthat the Great Depression of the 1920s….“…. was not accidental. It was a carefully contrived occurrence…. TheInternational Bankers sought to bring about conditions of despair here, so theymight emerge as rulers of us all.”It was the same in Germany where the seeds of dictatorship were sown. EnterAdolf Hitler, a First World War lance-corporal, who had been much impressed bythe methods employed by Mussolini. But Hitler’s obsession with Germany as themaster Aryan race went back much further. As a youth he would takehallucinogenic drugs to stimulate his mystical experiences. The swastika, whichHitler was to use as the emblem of his Nazi party, was a Brotherhood symbolgoing back to ancient times. He was much impressed as a youngster by a bookshopowner in Vienna who preached the gospel of the German super-race, which somebelieved was created by extra-terrestrial giants. Houston Stewart Chamberlain,the writer who so influenced Kaiser Wilhelm, was later to claim that Hitler wasthe new Messiah, and Chamberlain’s work would become a basis of Nazi philosophy.Hitler’s rise to German Dictator quickened rapidly after he joined the secretpolitical branch of the Army District Command which was a law unto itself. Itwas so deeply patriotic that it assassinated, for crimes against the nation,some of the people who had negotiated the peace terms for Germany at the end ofthe First World War. The District Command was really the assassination wing of asecret Brotherhood group called the Thule Society which believed in all thenonsense about the super-race and the German Messiah. It sentenced people todeath in its own secret ‘courts’. Hitler and the Thule Society believed theywere being guided by the extra-terrestrials who had created the Aryan race, orwhat they said was a race. The same industrialists financed both the ThuleSociety and the District Command. Dietrich Eckart, the morphine addict whoheaded the Thule Society, saw Hitler as the Messiah figure they had been lookingfor. They ensured that he became the leader of the German Workers’ Party. Thiswas transformed into the fascist National Socialist (Nazi) Party and Hitlersought to spread his anti-Jewish, anti-communist nationalism to the entireworld. His creed captured the collective mind of Germany which tuned to thethought waves of fascism until it was hypnotised and controlled by the rantingsof this misguided man. He had increased his standing before his election byhaving his Gestapo-in-waiting burn down the German Parliament building, theReichstag, in 1933, for which he blamed the communists. He also used the fear ofthe Russians to great effect. In this he was helped by the Pope who spreadhatred of Communist Russia at every opportunity. The churches had been mortifiedwhen Lenin’s revolution banned religion. They didn’t know they had beendouble-crossed by the same Brotherhood they believed was supporting them. TheBrotherhood were also playing off Hitler and Stalin against each other – forboth of whom they were responsible.Two other secret societies which played a part in the Nazi revolution were theVril Society and the Edelweiss Society. Like the Thules, they had links withtheir brethren in Britain. Rudolph Hess and Heinrich Himmler were both ‘Vrils’ –Himmler was to head the appalling Nazi Gestapo and SS. Hermann Goering was amember of the Edelweiss Society and believed that Hitler was the Nordic Messiahhe was convinced was expected. Hitler and his cronies denounced the Jews andCommunists on the radio day after day, as he poisoned the German mind to hiscreed.He followed the example of Church and dictators throughout history. Anyliterature advocating freedom of any kind was destroyed, and promises he made tothe socialists and monarchists who helped to elect him were forgotten. Therewould be no more elections. The Fuhrer would be obeyed. Around him he gatheredhis principal officers like Goebbels, Ribbentrop, Goering and Himmler. Theywould rule Germany by terror, and Jewish people would suffer terrible treatment.Ribbentrop was to have several cosy conversations with the Pope about Germany’sexpansion plans, although the main agent of the secret Vatican-Germany-Americaalliance was Rudolph Hess.So now there were dictators in Italy, Germany, and Russia, where Josef Stalinhad succeeded Lenin in 1924. Soon there would be another in Spain. In 1936General Franco, a Roman Catholic extremist, led a revolt against the SpanishRepublican Government which had reduced the power of the Church since the dayswhen it controlled everything. The Spanish Civil War was a prelude to the nextworld conflict, with Germany and Italy lining up behind Franco, while Britain,France, and Russia supported the republicans. Tragically for the Spanish people,Franco’s armies won, and he did for the Roman Catholic Church in Spain whatMussolini had done in Italy. It was given back its wealth and lands, receivedlarge annual payments from the state, and the education system was back in itscontrol. Religious paraphernalia was everywhere and the inquisition returned.The Papal flag was flown by Franco as he overturned Spanish democracy and hisflag was proudly flown at the Vatican. The Pope’s role in this victory overdemocracy had been crucial. He had appealed to Roman Catholics all over Europeto go to Spain and fight in this ‘Holy War’.When Hitler began his expansionism into Austria, the Roman Catholic bishopsthere told the people to be loyal to the Nazis and a swastika was flown from thetower of Vienna Cathedral. Hitler enjoyed Roman Catholic support also in hisconquest of Czechoslovakia. Pope Pius XI and his successor, Pius XII, wantedmore than anything for Germany to overthrow communism in Russia. Little did theyknow that Germany had played a vital part in creating communism! The story ofVatican support for the fascists is quite disgraceful, although not surprisinggiven its history; so is that of the Brotherhood industrialists and bankers whowere supporting both sides. By now there were Brotherhood organisationscoordinating the elite bankers and industrial combines across the world. One wasthe Bank for International Settlements that was beyond democratic control. Amongthe financial backers of the Nazis were the German chemical giant I.G. Farben,among whose directors were Max and Paul Warburg who ran banks in both Germanyand the United States. The Warburgs were instrumental in starting the AmericanFederal Reserve System and you’ll recall that Max Warburg was mentioned earlieras a source of funds for Lenin and the communist revolution in Russia! The Bankof Manhattan was a Warburg bank, and one of its directors, H.A. Metz, was fromI.G. Farben, which had been a cartel partner of the Rockefeller Corporation’sStandard Oil Company before the war, as part of the Brotherhood’s banking andindustrial network. Standard Oil supplied the Nazis during the war throughSwitzerland, and Avery Rockefeller had set up a company which combined theirinterests with Schroeder, Hitler’s personal bank. The Guaranty Trust and theUnion Banking Corporation of New York were among the biggest backers of theNazis. One of the UBC’s directors was Prescott Bush, father of George. C.E.Mitchell, a director of Farben’s American arm, was also a director of theFederal Reserve, and the network was now so tightly knit you could hardly seethe join. Farben gave extra funding to Himmler’s SS, and so did the Germansubsidiaries of the American corporations, I.T.T and General Electric. GeneralMotors supplied both sides in the war, as did the European subsidiaries of theUS banks, with the blessing of headquarters. Ball bearings, which the Allieswere short of, were shipped to the Nazis via South America by the Vice-Chairmanof the American War Productions Board. Farben ran the factories connected to theconcentration camps to take advantage of the, literally, slave labour theyoffered. I.G. Farben still continues to operate today under various names.*The Brotherhood network in Britain supported the Nazis – and still does – andthe Bank of England helped Hitler. Its director, Montague Norman, who was a ‘Mr.Big’ of the world banking network, met in the Spring of 1934 with other Britishbusinessmen at the bank’s headquarters in Threadneedle Street, and it appearsthey agreed to give Hitler secret funding, while Norman tried to persuade theBritish government to remove its support for France and transfer it to Germany.Even after Hitler had begun his killing tour of Europe, the Bank of Englandreleased to him six million pounds of Czechoslovak reserves held in London afterhe had invaded that country. All through the war the Brotherhood companies andbanks in Allied countries were covertly funding both sides, which includedsupport for Mussolini when his regime got into financial difficulties. It madethem a fortune, something that was increased a thousandfold by the need torebuild a shattered world. It also maintained the yoke of suffering andignorance on the population. The Bank of England was nationalised by the newLabour Government in 1946, but it still has a massive influence on Britain’seconomic policies and I expect it to start demanding more independence fromgovernment.Hitler ignored all agreements made by Germany in the Treaty of Versailles aftertheir defeat in the First World War. He assembled a vast army, navy and airforce, and the rest of Europe feared the worst. After Hitler’s invasion ofAustria, the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, flew to meet him inMunich in 1938 and came home with his famous agreement signed by Hitler, whichChamberlain claimed would mean ‘peace in our time’. Chamberlain was a genuineman who only wanted peace for his people, but Hitler had other ideas. WhenGermany invaded Poland in 1939 Britain and France declared war. Poland was nowagain under foreign rule after a brief independence, during which the RomanCatholic majority had persecuted the Eastern orthodox Christians in their midst.After the war Poland was absorbed into the Soviet Union until that empirecollapsed in 1991. The Poles then handed over their independence to the RomanCatholic Church which today, effectively, runs the country. If anyone thinks theRoman Catholic Church has really moved on, they should see how quickly it hastaken control of Poland once the opportunity presented itself.Hitler captured France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but chose not to attackBritain when we were in disarray at home. Winston Churchill had replacedChamberlain, but Britain was not prepared for war. Had Hitler attacked then hewould almost certainly have captured the British Isles quite easily. Why did henot attack when Britain was clearly there for the taking? The evacuation ofBritish troops from Dunkirk in an armada of little boats in 1940 was amarvellous achievement, but if the German commanders had wanted to stop it, theycould have. Why didn’t they? Instead of invading Britain, Hitler turned his mindto Russia which suffered fantastic losses in the defence of their land. Again itwas the courage and commitment of a manipulated people that weakened the Germanforces and delayed their plans. The conflict spread to North Africa where theAllies confronted German and Italian troops under Rommel. It was Rommel’sultimate defeat at El Alamein, and the Soviets’ extraordinary defeat of theGermans in the East, which ended a series of German victories and the tide beganto turn the flow the way of the Allies. But the big change came when the UnitedStates entered the war in 1941. She had already been supporting the Allies withsupplies and arms when the Japanese attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harborin Hawaii. This brought the US into the war – exactly as it was meant to. Thiswas the Lusitania mark II.The story behind that Japanese attack goes back a long way. The Japanese, likethe Chinese, are of the Mongol race. Both countries have a history of civil warand unrest. The Japanese main religion is Shintoism and they too were enamouredby secret societies. The most dominant one had a Black Dragon symbol. Theybelieved their Emperor to be Divine, and themselves to be descended from thegods, a chosen people descended from extra-terrestrials. All efforts byChristian missionaries to convert them failed, and in the 17th century thebehaviour of the missionaries towards them was so appalling that they closedtheir country to all Europeans for two hundred years. In the second half of the19th century, steamships from the United States arrived and refused to be turnedaway. Japan was attacked by a combination of the Americans, British, Dutch andFrench until they were forced to open their ports. The Japanese became a peopletransformed in the decades that followed. They used the weapons provided by theChristian world to attack and defeat China in 1894, and Russia in 1905. Japanalso entered the First World War against Germany.Between 1937 and 1939 she took over most of China, whose people were in themidst of constant insurrection against the stream of emperors and presidentialdictators thrust upon them. Modern China’s story is of diabolical exploitationby the colonial powers, with the British addicting the Chinese to the drug opiumfor purposes of trade and control. In the run up to Pearl Harbor, the Britishand Americans had been trying to stop Japan overthrowing the Chinese GeneralChiang Kai-shek, and the Japanese resented this. They were given everyencouragement to enter the war, and I believe that Winston Churchill, afreemason, knew all about it, as did President Franklin D Roosevelt, a highranking freemason and claimed by some to have reached the 33rd degree. Churchillwould later say of this time that Roosevelt…. “said he would wage war, but notdeclare it (and) that he would become more and more provocative everything wasbeing done to force an ‘incident’ that could lead the United States into war”.In the US Senate in 1939, Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota announced thathe had seen a series of volumes called The Next War. One of them was entitledPropaganda In The Next War. He said the writer of that book was a SidneyRogerson, whom he could not trace. But he knew that the editor-in-chief of theseries was Captain Liddell Hart who was a writer and military authority inEurope with connections to the London Times. The work Propaganda In The Next Warhad, he said, included the following analysis of the background to World War I:“For some time the issue as to which side the United States would take hung inthe balance, the final result was a credit to our British propaganda. Thereremain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world Jew population ofapproximately fifteen million, no fewer than five million are in the UnitedStates; 25% of the inhabitants of New York are Jews.“During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewish public by thepromise of the Jewish national home in Palestine, held by Ludendorf to be amaster stroke of Allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to Jewsin America, but to Jews in Germany as well.”The Americans entered the First World War in 1917, and on November 6th of thatyear came the famous Balfour Declaration, when the British Government announcedin a letter to Lionel Rothschild the recognition of Palestine as a nationalhomeland for the Jews. It is important to note that Lord Balfour was a member ofthe Round Table inner elite. The dreadful events in Israel in recent years,which have caused pain for Israeli and Arab alike, are the result of Britainnegotiating away Palestine to get the United States to enter the First World Warand to advance Brotherhood ambitions which go back much further. But how couldthe American public be persuaded to support Britain in the next war, which thispropaganda report clearly knew was inevitable?“To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much moredifficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definitethreat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home bypropaganda to every citizen, before the republic will again take arms in anexternal quarrel…“The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, andthis might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate,it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandists to achieve this,just as in the Great War they succeeded in embroiling the United States withGermany.“Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirelysincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearlyenunciate our belief in the democratic form of government, and ourfirm resolveto adhere to….the old goddess of democracy routine.”The main themes of wars are known and planned in advance. It is clear fromevidence that has emerged since the war that President Franklin D Roosevelt knewat least forty-eight hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor that the Japanesewere going to strike. He did nothing to warn his sailors and the people ofHawaii, because he wanted the American public to be so outraged that they wouldagree to enter the war in Europe. That is exactly what happened, just as thepre-war propagandists had planned. The method of goading the Japanese came fromthe Brotherhood’s Council on Foreign Relations, the Round Table creation. TheCouncil’s War and Peace Studies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt suggesting thataid be sent to China, and that he strangle Japanese trade by freezing their USassets, imposing a trade embargo on Japan, and refusing them the use of thePanama Canal. This he did, and Roosevelt and the Brotherhood were rewarded withthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt was a pawn of the Brotherhood inthe form of the Council on Foreign Relations. Much of his cabinet came fromthere and his son-in-law, Curtis Dall, quoted in Jim Keith’s Casebook onAlternative Three, said:“For a long time I felt that (Roosevelt)….had developed many thoughts and ideasthat were his own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn’t. Most of histhoughts, his political ‘ammunition’ as it were, were carefully manufactured forhim in advance by the Council on Foreign Relations – One World Money group.Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded thatprepared ‘ammunition’ in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the Americanpeople – and thus paid off and retained his internationalist political support.”The same applied to Churchill and those who decided he would be Prime Minister,and the same goes on in both countries, and all the others, today. According toinformation leaked by a decoding officer, Tyler Kent, to Captain A.H. RamseyM.P., before the war, Churchill and Roosevelt were setting the whole thing upvia coded messages while Neville Chamberlain was still Prime Minister. The warwas now truly global with fronts in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East, asthe Japanese occupied the Allied colonies like Malaya, Singapore, thePhilippines, Borneo, Hong Kong and Burma. The men, women and children who werecaught in those countries when the Japanese invaded were subjected tounbelievable torture and atrocities. But then it is no good one country beingholier than another in its version of history. Every country on the planet hasshown itself capable of crimes against humanity. The British authorities reeledback in horror at the concentration camps in Germany, but it was the British whostarted the idea with their camps created by Lord Kitchener, in which 26,000prisoners died in South Africa during the Boer War. And the Allies were fightingalongside the Russian regime who were running concentration camps for their ownpeople and slaughtering millions in other ways. Every continent was involved inthe war, and the soldiers of Australia and New Zealand once again supported theAllied cause. Even with the support of America and the other English-speakingpeoples, the fascists were defeated only through horrendous loss of life on bothsides. With the fascist armies overcome in North Africa the push begannorthwards into Italy in 1943. The Fascist Grand Council restored King VictorEmmanuel as ruler, and Mussolini was forced to resign. The Italian Parliamentwas reconvened under the new Prime Minister, Marshall Pietro Badoglio. He firsttold Hitler he would continue the fight, but then made a peace pact with theAllies. Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, but theywere killed by Communist partisans and their corpses held up for ridicule andpublic display in Milan.The Germans tried to hold back the Allied advance through Italy, but in the endtheir defences were breached. On June 6th, 1944, came Operation Overlord whenBritish, American, and Canadian forces under their Supreme Commander, Dwight DEisenhower, launched the D-Day Landings along the beaches of Normandy inNorthern France. With great courage and enormous loss of life, they pushed onacross France to liberate Paris and occupy Western Germany, while the Russiansadvanced in Eastern Europe. The war in Europe was over, but allies who had beenunited against a common enemy were about to become extremely hostile to eachother in what passed for peace. With Germany on the retreat, the latter weeks ofthe war became a race for Berlin between the western armies and the Russians.Both wanted to be in the best possible negotiating position for the division ofland when the conflict was over. The Russians would spread their Communist(state fascist) creed to expand the Empire of the Soviet Union and encompassCzechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Rumania, Poland, and the easternpart of Germany. A wall was built to divide Berlin between capitalist andcommunist and those in the East who tried to reach the West were shot by theirown army. Families were divided by the whims of the Communist dictator, JosefStalin, and his underlings and successors who would now murder millions of theirown people in this ‘workers’ paradise’.The defeat of Germany did not end the war entirely. Japan still held out andRoosevelt’s successor, Harry S. Truman, another freemason, gave the order todrop the atom bomb which had been developed during the war years. An arm of theIlluminati’s Round Table, the Institute for Advanced Study at PrincetonUniversity, New Jersey, gave vital support to those who were developing thebomb. One of its members was Robert Oppenheimer, the leading light in thecreation of the bomb. Albert Einstein also regularly used the Institute. It haslong been a front for the advancement of Brotherhood science which the publichas no idea about, but which is usually between 50 and 100 years ahead of‘public’ science. The Japanese Emperor Hirohito surrendered after two atomicbombs were dropped by US planes on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki onAugust 6th and 9th, 1945. In fact, the former British Cabinet Minister TonyBenn, says he established that Japan was willing to surrender before these bombswere dropped. Eighty thousand men, women and children were killed in Hiroshimaon the fateful day that atomic warfare came to this planet (or rather returnedto it), and others would die horribly from the effects of radiation poisoning.In all thirty-five million people were killed in the Second World War andhundreds of millions were wounded, tortured and scarred for life mentally,physically and emotionally. And this horror was the result of a war that nevershould have been, and never would have been had the Brotherhood network notcaused it. Add to those figures those millions who died and suffered in theFirst World War, and all the others and words are hard to speak.But such emotions do not trouble the Illuminati:“And how far-seeing were our learned elders in ancient times when they said thatto attain a serious end it behoves not to stop at any means or to count thevictims sacrificed for the sake of that end . . . . We have not counted thevictims of the Goy cattle . . . . ” (Protocol 15)Most of the main players in the Nazi regime, probably including Hitler, escaped.He and his lady, Eva Braun, did not die in the bunker, many researchers believe.At least some of them went to South America. From the views and evidence I haveheard and seen, I believe that Hitler was flown out of Germany by the famousGerman aviator, Hans Bauer. He flew Nazi wealth and personnel out of Berlin.Hitler would have had no trouble getting away to a quiet airfield because, whenthe Russians arrived in Berlin, they found behind the bookcase in Hitler’s rooma secret passage leading to an underground tunnel with its own trolley railwayline. The dental records of Hitler and the corpse said to be Hitler did notmatch and it is most likely to have been the body of his driver, Julius Schreck,a Hitler fanatic, who looked like him and acted as his ‘double’ on severaloccasions. A Russian statement in 1945 said:“No trace of the bodies of Hitler or Eva Braun has been discovered….It isestablished that Hitler, by means of false testimony, sought to hide his traces.Irrefutable proof exists that a small plane left the Tiergarten at dawn on April30th, flying in the direction of Hamburg. Three men and a woman are known tohave been on board. It has also been established that a large submarine leftHamburg before the arrival of the British forces. Mysterious persons were onboard the submarine, among them a woman.”What is without doubt is that the Nazi influence, far from disappearing at theend of the war, continues to flourish within the secret societies and is nowbeginning to surface again among the mind-controlled human fodder who supportthe far right movement. They are also very influential within the police, themilitary, and the intelligence services like the American Central IntelligenceAgency, the CIA. Indeed the CIA engaged Reinhart Gehlen, the head of Russianoperations in the Nazi Secret Service, to build the CIA network in Europe, andhe used many former SS officers on his staff. The international policeorganisation, INTERPOL, has been headed by many former SS officers. The Nazisand their ‘values’ play a big part in the running of the modern Brotherhood, andit is time the truth was told and the robots rebelled. History is clearly notwhat it appears to be, and yet the official version is being indoctrinated intogeneration after generation through the ‘education’ system and theBrotherhood-controlled media.“Among the members of these (Freemasonic) lodges will be almost all the agentsof international and national police since their service is for us irreplacablein the respect that the police is in the position not only to use its ownparticular measures with the insubordinate (Those who challenge theBrotherhood), but also to screen our activities and provide pretexts fordiscontents etc.” (Protocol 15)There is another aspect to this story that needs to be highlighted. All theconflicts that I have documented, and the thousands I have not, have had adisastrous affect on the Earth’s energy field which has to absorb the negativeenergy humanity generates. The scale of this struck me on a trip to France withmy family in 1993 when we stayed in a house between Caen and Falaise inNormandy. Falaise is the birthplace of William the Conquerer. It was a lovelyarea, but you could feel something unpleasant in the atmosphere. I knew that theD-Day Landings had taken place on the coast a short drive away from where wewere staying, but it was only when we were leaving for home that I realised wehad been living near the scene of a bloody carnage in 1944. The Battle of theFalaise Gap was, in the words of Eisenhower: ‘One of the biggest slaughterfields a war sector ever knew’. More than 650,000 people were killed or wounded.When thought patterns are broadcast by people, they stay in that area until theyare balanced by other patterns. The spirits of the dead are often still there,too. The confusion and pain of the experience can prevent them from getting backto their ‘home’ frequency. We call them ‘ghosts’ or ‘lost souls’. When you go tothe scene of battles it can feel ‘eerie’. These are the thought patterns offear, horror, aggression and pain that were created by those involved. Sensitivepeople who go to such places can hear battles or see them happening. They aretuning into these thought waves. We could feel them in that area of Normandy.There was a very malevolent energy, because like attracts like, and negativeenergy attracts negative energy. My son, Gareth, then eleven, would not goupstairs in the house alone and it was very unpleasant. There was a door in anattic which was held shut by a substantial catch, but every time my wife, Linda,passed that door it was open. She would close it tight only for the same tohappen again. Then one night she was awake and she looked across at Gareth whowas sleeping in our room, because he was so frightened. Hovering above him shesaw a dark cloud of energy. She watched as the cloud swept across the room andout through the door. The next morning she told me the story. She didn’t knowthat I had woken up that night and felt a very strange and unpleasantatmosphere. After the experience, the atmosphere in the house changed and theattic door never came open again. Gareth’s fear disappeared, too. If you imaginethat I am talking of the effects on the energy field of one battle in one war,you can see why the negative imbalance has progressed so quickly across theplanet. But equally it can be removed just as quickly if we change the way wethink.We are involved in a spiritual struggle between harmony and disharmony. TheLuciferic consciousness manipulates extra-terrestrials and human behaviour byfiring thought patterns into their individual and collective consciousness.These patterns are designed to distort the mental and, especially, emotionallevels of our being. This has the effect of closing down the flow of energies,knowledge, and enlightenment between higher and lower selves. This flow hasfurther been affected since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution which hasturned many humans into physical as well as mental robots, and caused severemental and emotional stress.In some ways human consciousness has come a long way over the period covered inthis book, but in others it has hardly progressed at all. We are now facing theDays of Decision when, on this dense physical level, we evolve and rebel or weperish. That is the choice that now faces us all.* Cecil Rhodes bequeathed large sums of money to found the “Rhodes Scholarships”to Oxford University for overseas students and to promote his belief in a oneworld government.

Farben offshoots."},{"pageContent":"11Big is Beautiful?THE Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century with theinvention of the steam engine, and within a hundred years this revolution wouldfill the skies with black smoke and pollution, rape the planet for fuels, andturn millions, eventually billions, into robots; mere extensions of a factorymachine.The poor and the weak have always been exploited by the landowners or whoeverhad the financial and physical power of the day. But now it was to be done on amassive, ultimately global scale, as the Brotherhood spread its economic cultureacross the world. The people came in from the countryside, and filthy urbansprawls appeared around the mills and the factories. They worked long hoursoften for starvation wages, and the system I have termed ‘take, make, andthrowaway’ had arrived. Its Pied Piper was the obsession with the pursuit ofeconomic growth – producing more, consuming more, and throwing away more, everyyear. But actually playing the tune was the Brotherhood network of bankers andtheir front organisations, the so-called ‘think tanks’.A new religion was born. It was called ‘science’. Christianity was stillpowerful, but its influence was now in terminal decline. Suddenly the scientistwas god. This science created the machine age and all the potions and poisonsthat have taken human life, quite possibly, to the brink of non-existence. Butas the 19th century passed to the 20th, this new culture and new god hadhypnotised much of human consciousness. Science, or what passes for it, decidedthat life after physical death was a myth. Everything could be explained by the‘logic’ of science. Basically we were all a cosmic accident, the product of therandom interaction of chemicals, atoms, and the like. This gave Christianitysome serious problems, but it gave the human race even more. Not least was thegrowing belief that life was pointless. The idea was that ‘life’s a bitch andthen you die’. The lives people were being forced to endure in the blackenedtowns and cities appeared to confirm that this was the case. It was anotherdrain on a human spirit already crushed by the robotic demands of the machineage.Christianity’s ability to stop the haemorrhage of support in the face ofscientific ‘evidence’ was not helped by the obvious nonsense of its dogmatic,unyielding, claims for the Bible to be literally true. It was now beginning toreap the consequences of refusing to budge from the dogma decided at Nicaea andin the centuries that immediately followed. But, as I said in a previous chapterthe view of life and Creation outlined in this book and others, was nowsuppressed not only by Christianity as it had been for nearly two thousandyears, but also by ‘science’. Christianity and ‘science’ may have appeared to bein conflict, but they had a mutual interest which was essential to the survivalof both. That was to ensure that as few people as possible believed thatconsciousness was eternal in everyone, and that our consciousness reincarnatesinto countless physical bodies on its journey of evolution through experience.The acceptance of that by the population would mean goodbye to Christianity andmost other religions, and goodbye to the whole basis of scientific ‘thinking’.One of the Brotherhood’s most effective tools is to make organisations dependentfor their very survival on the suppression of knowledge.The result of this was a world created by the five physical senses whichpandered only to those senses. God was dead and the idea of spirit was aprimitive illusion. Materialism had arrived with a vengeance even thoughresearch shows that the whole Darwinism – materialistic ‘science’ was aBrotherhood set-up. The manipulators knew, and know, it is a nonsense. Ourculture was built by material senses for material senses. Such a process couldnot have created any other kind of world than the one we see today. The higherlevels of humans were dismissed by ‘science’ as not even existing and the onlyhigh-profile alternative, Christianity and its religious soul-mates around theWorld, were leaking credibility with every passing year, thanks to the time-warpin which they are imprisoned. This left a spiritual vacuum which is only nowbeing filled as an understanding of who we are begins to re-emerge in ourconsciousness. The material-cosmic-accident view so took over this new religioncalled science, that even when members of its own profession challenged thisbelief, they were ridiculed, outcast, or ignored. Just as the Brotherhoodensured that they would be. They don’t want some freethinking scientist to findout the truth and be able to prove it. Nearly every true scientist who has takenhuman understanding forward has faced that kind of reaction and opposition.‘Science’ became obsessed with the physical level and concentrated its mind ondiscovering the secrets and potential of the physical world, at the expense ofseeking those higher levels where the answers really lie. Almost from the start,‘science’ has been serving the system and the Brotherhood by helping to imprisonthe human race. In doing that, the new religion has merely followed the patternof the old.The whole system was founded and underpinned at every turn by exploitation.Exploitation of the planet; of the human robots in the mines and factories; andof the people in what we now call the Third World. Most of these‘under-developed’ countries were then under the occupation and control ofBritain and other European countries. Countries like Britain could not lose atthis stage. It had the technology, primitive as it was, and it had the BritishEmpire. It could take the natural ‘resources’ from the countries it controlled,turn those resources into products, and sell them back at a profit. This globalexploitation by the strong at the expense of the weak would destroy the culturesof Third World countries and take away their self-sufficiency in food. This wasvital for the exploitation to continue. When these countries eventually rebelledagainst physical occupation, Europe and the United States had to replace thatwith other forms of control. They achieved this by replacing physical occupationwith financial occupation. They made poorer countries dependent on theindustrialised world for their food and finance. The American senator, HubertHumphrey, put it like this:“I have heard that people may become dependent on us for food. I know that wasnot supposed to be good news. To me that was good news, because before peoplecan do anything they have to eat. And if you are looking for a way to get peopleto lean on you and to be dependent on you, in terms of their co-operation withyou, it seems to me that food dependency would be terrific.”Exactly. This motivation would lead to the famine and starvation of the 20thcentury. It was compounded by the exploitation of land for the maximumproduction of cash crops in ways that would destroy its fertility; and by thepolitical and internal strife in these countries, often caused by the effects ofpoverty or the overthrowing of regimes, openly or covertly, which did not suitthe interests of the Brotherhood elite. They didn’t want Third World countriesto make their own decisions – they wanted them dependent on the same Brotherhoodbankers that ran the West. This goes on today with the United States the leadingforce in the ongoing effort to unseat any politician or group that threatensAmerican or Brotherhood interests. Witness Nicaragua and the countless SouthAmerican dictators imposed and empowered by the United States. I go into airthis in some detail in my book, It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This. It is all partof the long term Brotherhood plan:“We are interested in the . . . . killing out of the Goyim. Our power is in thechronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker, because by allthat this implies he is made the slave of our will, and he will not find in hisown authorities either strength or energy to set against our will. Hungercreated the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given tothe aristocracy by the legal authority of kings.” (Protocol 3).The speed with which all this happened has been astonishing. When I wastravelling through Arizona in 1993, I stopped at a little cafe at a place calledParker. On the wall was a poster depicting the exploits of Butch Cassidy and theSundance Kid whose bank-robbing activities were made famous by a film of thesame name. What struck me most was that it all happened in this century. TheUnited States went from horseback to space travel in less than 70 years, perhapseven less than that if some stories of covert space flights in the fifties aretrue. At the same time the USA has become the front line of self-destruction.Anyone who doesn’t believe that should go into any eating house on any street inAmerica and see just how much of the Earth’s physical form is dumped into arubbish bin every minute. Since the industrialisation and Christianisation ofthe United States, it has consumed more of the Earth’s ‘resources’ and createdmore pollution than any other society on the planet. And tragically that is theculture which has taken over the world in less than the blink of an eye in thelifespan of Mother Earth.If you take the Earth to be one year old, then under that time scale theIndustrial Revolution has been with us for less than two seconds. In thatfraction of time we have behaved in ways that now threaten the planet’s abilityto be a home for human life. Every twenty-four hours an area of tropical foresttwenty-five miles by twenty is destroyed or degraded; deserts advance by asimilar area; 200 million tonnes of top soil is lost through erosion; many andincreasing numbers of species become extinct; and 100,000 people, nearly half ofthem children, die through hunger or hunger-related disease. Every single day.But why should we be surprised at this? How could it be any other way when youhave an economic system that depends for its survival, let alone its success, ontaking, making, and throwing away more every year to worship at the Brotherhoodaltar of economic growth? It is the ultimate conveyor belt to global suicide.The stark truth is that if you need to consume more every year, the human andenvironmental effects are both enormous and eventually fatal. Either theBrotherhood elite are incredibly stupid, or they have lost control of theircreation, or they have other motives for what they are doing to the planet. Isuspect a bit of both. Here is a summary of why it has taken the human racelittle more than two hundred years to go from the dawn of the IndustrialRevolution to the mess and mayhem we see today – and why it has so massivelyserved Brotherhood interests:(1) If you have constantly to produce more and consume more, you soon pass thepoint where that can continue within your own borders. You have to sell abroadand export your culture. You have to change the way others live and impose yourevolution upon them. You do this by making them dependent on you and by sellingyour culture through manipulative advertising. If you have an addictive product,like cigarettes, so much the better, because once people are hooked you have acaptive market. And once you have other countries addicted to the pursuit ofyour culture, you have even more power to make them use their resources and landto supply you with what you need in order to supply them with finished productsat a handsome profit. By now you have destroyed their self-sufficiency in food,and you can claim that the developed world is helping the underdeveloped worldout of the goodness of its heart, and the success of its culture by ‘giving’food to them when in fact millions are starving, because they can no longerproduce food for themselves. Even then you only respond with as little as youcan get away with in situations that are either well-publicised or suit yourdesire to make others do your will. As someone once said: ‘When you have gotsomeone by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow’. They might just aseasily have said ‘stomachs’. The need to expand production and sales each yearmeans that everyone has to compete with everyone else. For every winner therehave to be losers, often dead ones. The one exception to that is the bankingelite. They can’t lose. We talk of the desire for cooperation in the world, andyet the very foundation of the economic ethos is to turn person against person,family against family, town against town, country against country, and tradingbloc against trading bloc in brutal competition, while the elite share thespoils between themselves.“In order to give the Goyim no time to think and take note, their minds must bediverted towards industry and trade. Thus, all the nations will be swallowed upin the pursuit of gain and in the race for it will not take note of their commonfoe. But, again, in order that freedom may once for all disintegrate and ruinthe communities of the Goyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis; theresult of this will be that what is withdrawn from the land by industry willslip through the hands and pass into speculation, that is, to our classes.”(Protocol 4).(2) It is vital that you also make your own population dependent for their foodand existence on the same system. If they have alternatives, they cannot beforced to do your will or stand by a factory machine most of their waking hours.The effect of this is to diminish their spirit and grind down their resistanceto any propaganda that you feed to them through a compliant and system-servingmedia. The need for expanding the system requires that your ‘scientific’research is geared to inventing new things that you can persuade people to buy;to finding cheaper ways of making those things through technology; and toinventing new weapons of mass destruction. As with video recorders, so withguided missiles. If you can constantly advance the technology of whatever youproduce, people and countries will constantly ‘update’. In short, they will keepbuying the same thing again and again as perfectly adequate products aresystematically made technologically ‘obsolete’. These twin aims of product andweapon advancement to serve the economic system is what science has largely beenabout. Serving humanity and seeking truth has been a strictly secondarymotivation for the scientific Brotherhood-manipulated establishment. Theweaponry is also important to protect the wealth of the powerful, and toincrease that wealth when it becomes economically desirable for a war in whichyou can supply both sides.(3) This system is so obviously destructive and stupid that if you allowedpeople to be shown its true nature, they would soon see the obvious.Christianity feared and vehemently opposed education for the masses because ofthe possible consequences of people seeing that creed for the silliness whichmost of it is. But they need not have worried. The system had no intention ofeducating people, especially the young. It wishes to indoctrinate, not educate,and that is what it has done. ‘Education’ is there to turn out fodder for thesystem. Its aim is to persuade people to see things its way and reject any ideathat there could possibly be an alternative. What could be better for the systemthan to take children away from their homes on most days during their formativeyears, and feed them whatever they need to believe to become the next generationof robots? It is quite happy to give Christianity a good mention up to a pointbecause that is no threat to anything except itself and human understanding. Aswe have seen both the System and Christianity have a big stake in holding backhuman understanding, anyway. Further afield, where there are native peoples whohave not been subjected to this economic mind control, you take away theirforests, lands and way of life either by force or through Christianisation. Withtheir culture destroyed, they become dependent and often seek to escape from thenightmare through alcohol or drugs. Your control of the world is extended byenvironmental destruction.(4) The need to produce and sell more every year means that the point quicklyarrives when people can no longer increase production by themselves. You buildmachines which turn out more products with fewer people. As production needsconstantly to increase, the machines have to get bigger and require ever fewerpeople. Unemployment grows. The way the system responds to this is in the onlyway it knows how: by fiddling the unemployment figures to hide how bad thingsreally are; by starting wars; and by increasing the number of things that peoplewant by manipulating the symbols of human success so they all relate topossessions. You need to make people dissatisfied with whatever they have and toseek happiness through the accumulation of material ‘things’. This however meansthat your production must follow the money because poor people can’t buy.Therefore production is increasingly geared to the wants of the well-offminority, and away from the needs of the poor majority. This leads to somepeople having every possession they could possibly desire, while others sleep incardboard boxes in the street.Look how the system has manipulated Christmas. Christianity recycled a paganmid-winter festival quite erroneously into the birthday of Jesus and the systemhas recycled that into an orgy of consumption. We speak of having a ‘traditionalChristmas’, when most of the traditions have only been here since the start ofthe Industrial Revolution. What should be a lovely time of rest, enjoyment and agathering together of friends and family, has become a nightmare for millions.Children are bombarded with television advertisements for expensive toys, andtheir parents often borrow money they cannot afford because they don’t want todisappointment them on Christmas Day. They either struggle through the next yearpaying off the debt, or they spend Christmas feeling guilty for not providingwhat their children have been conditioned to want. This exploitation of emotionsbecomes more desperate and explicit every year because the Christmas spendingboom is now essential to the survival of many shops and factories.The difference between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ comes down to the number ofpieces of paper they possess. This mostly has nothing whatsoever to do withtheir abilities or their desire to contribute to the well-being of society. Youcan be a financial ‘winner’ and earn lots of bits of paper by making someplastic claptrap that is no real use to anyone. But you can be a financial loserby dedicating your life to the care of others. What you sell is what matters,not what you contribute to humanity. As we have seen, the easiest way to makemoney is to create it out of nothing. Values and desires become distorted bythis and societies become sick and more divided. Another implication of thisannual expansion is that, as production becomes more mechanised, the investmentnecessary to compete gets greater and the small fall by the wayside. Big becomesbeautiful and life becomes ugly. The economic power gathers in fewer and fewerhands in line with the Brotherhood plan and the major corporations and bankscall the shots far more than elected politicians.(5) The mopping up of unemployment by the expansion of ‘wants’ can only go onfor so long. Through this century, and particularly since the sixties andseventies, the so-called ‘Third World’ has started to produce more finishedproducts. The system that started with Britain exploiting its empire for‘resources’ and selling them back the finished products has changeddramatically. The whole of Europe and then the United States followed andexpanded what Britain had started. In the second half of this century, the FarEast, Asia, Africa, and South America, were sold the Industrial Dream, often bybanks who wished to invest the money that was pouring in, especially from Arabcountries after the Brotherhood-engineered oil price surge of the 1970s. Theworld has become awash with products looking for people to buy them.(6) At the same time there are fewer people with the money to buy thoseproducts. Once a large number of countries have the same ambition – to producemore and sell more – and they pass the point where this can continue withintheir own borders, everyone has to compete with everyone else for sales all overthe world. This becomes a battle to the economic and, for at least 100,000people every day, the physical death. More automation is required to producemore products at a lower cost because everyone has to compete to find ways ofmaking the same product cheaper. More automation means less employment, and lessmoney in people’s pockets to buy the products the machines are making. The majormanufacturers begin to transfer much of their production to Third Worldcountries because the laws on exploitation there are even more lax than in theWest, and you can pay people a fraction of the wages demanded in Europe andAmerica.(7) As a result of all this, the system is now in desperate trouble and that isprecisely what the banking elite want to justify their next step, a centralisedworld economy, based on a World Central Bank. While some unemployment is seen asgood for the system because it helps to keep those employed subservient throughfear of losing their job, there comes a stage where it is dangerous. Thishappens when the numbers without a job, and with no prospect of getting one,reach uncontrollable proportions. The amount of money being produced bydeclining sales is no longer sufficient to pay the welfare benefits of thoseincreasing numbers who are no longer employed and the social needs of thevictims the system spits out when they are no longer any use to it. The systemis so crazy that to survive it needs more and more people to buy each year, butfewer and fewer people to make what they buy. It cannot have both, but it needsboth. People will be subservient only while they are indoctrinated to believethat the system will provide. When it becomes clear that it will not, peoplebegin to rebel against that system. This rebellion becomes even more powerful asthose without work and with no prospect of work, see their welfare benefits cutback by politicians overseeing declining industrial sales in the wake of allthat I have described. The Illuminati want the people to respond violently toall this as we shall see, and the response, the rebellion, must be peaceful, iftheir plan is to be thwarted.(8) The main waste product of this system is human debris. When you force peopleto work in a soulless, mindless, system, this can have severe mental andemotional effects. Our hearts desire freedom, love and joy. Our inner self wantsto be positive, creative, and tap all the endless potential that we all have,and I mean all. But the system demands that we are little more than theextension of technology and expendable whenever technology can be created toreplace us. To the system we are not people or spiritual beings, we are units ofproduction and consumption. You will even note that we are now referred to bythe stewards of the system, the politicians, economists, and industrialists, as‘consumers’ because that is how it sees us. This system without a soul hascreated an explosion in other expressions of consumption such as alcohol anddrugs. These are ways that people try to escape from the nightmare and the agonytheir inner selves are suffering. They may not even be aware that they arefeeling like this at a deeper level. But it will still manifest in drugs andother forms of temporary escape from the realities of this mad world. The stressof the system’s demands, the constant competition, the fear, the imprisonmentand suppression of the spirit, has become a conveyor belt for mental, emotional,and physical disease, or dis-ease as it really should be pronounced. The stresscauses imbalances in the mental and emotional energy fields and these are passedon through the chakras to all levels of being, including the physical body. Wehave more and more illness caused by stress and all the pollution and otherdangers the system produces in its insatiable desire for expansion at all costs.Is it any wonder that you see defeat in so many faces. The system, science, andreligion have combined to make billions tired of living, but scared of dying.Crime is another consequence. If you programme people to see their own successand that of others in terms of consumption and possessions, don’t hold up yourhands in horror when those who cannot earn the money to consume and possesschoose another way of ‘succeeding’ in the system’s terms – theft, mugging,burglaries. In times of high unemployment more people are denied the ability tosucceed through consumption or even to feed their families, and this is why thecrime figures soar. Also if the system treats human life as meaningless,worthless, fodder, without dignity or respect, don’t be surprised if that is howmany others start to see their fellow human beings. Growing violence is evidenceof this. Resentment at being rejected by the system leads to resentment againsteverything and everyone. In this state of mind some will mug an old lady for afew pounds or dollars without a thought for what they have done to her. Theirmotto will be: ‘the system has no respect for me, so why should I have anyrespect for anyone else? It’s everyone for themselves’.But hold on a second. If your agenda involves the introduction of anever-more-authoritarian police force, military and legal system, what do youneed more than anything to carry public opinion with you? More crime, the moreviolent and horrible the better.In a system in which the possession of pieces of paper is the only way you canenjoy food, shelter and warmth, you are faced with increasing numbers of peoplemade redundant by technology and recession who are hungry, homeless and cold.There are also those who are disabled, elderly and infirm, or unable to work forother reasons. These, too, are denied the means to earn pieces of paper. TheSystem reacts to this in a variety of ways. In some countries it ignores suchpeople and suppresses wholesale rebellion by strengthening the police force andthe army and by making those in work fearful of speaking out against thiscruelty and losing their job. Elsewhere, governments pay these victims of thesystem as little as they can get away with, though in a few more enlightenedcountries they are more generous. But all use the weapon of fear to control thepopulation and prevent serious rebellion.Every year the System is faced with bigger bills for crime, policing, medicalservices, welfare benefits, and all the rest. This is an inevitable consequenceof take, make and throwaway, and all that goes with it. And how does the Systemand its mind-controlled politicians react to this? By saying we must have agreater expansion of production and consumption to raise more money by creatingmore growth. This ‘policy’ spews out yet more victims and demands yet moreresources are spent on crime, police, medical services, and welfare benefits.Those who are hypnotised by the Brotherhood propaganda do not have theintelligence or the vision to think any other way no matter how nonsensical this‘thinking’ may be. As Mark Twain said: ‘If your only tool is a hammer, allproblems look like nails’.(9) The demands of the system and its de-humanisation of people has led to theexploitation of other life forms. I have heard it said that animal rightscampaigners should think more about cruelty to people than animals. This missesthe point. Cruelty is cruelty. Any society that will justify the appallingtreatment of animals that goes on today will have no qualms about being cruel topeople. Animals, like people, have become another commodity, another form ofthroughput. We perform experiments on them which make the worst excesses of theNazis seem like kindness itself. We have the horrors of the slaughterhouses andfood factories – 500 million chickens in Britain are forced to live out theirwretched lives standing on wire mesh in tiny cages with hardly enough room tosit down. They are egg-throughput machines. Around 40 million little chicks arekilled in Britain every year within hours of their birth for the ‘crime’ ofbeing male. They are from a species genetically developed for egg laying. Themales cannot lay eggs and so they cannot live. Every week in Britishslaughterhouses we murder 8 million chickens, 300,000 pigs, 80,000 cattle,500,000 turkeys, 50,000 rabbits, and 300,000 sheep in conditions of dreadfulcruelty and barbarism. As the saying goes: If slaughterhouse walls were made ofglass, we’d all be vegetarians. Only a human race de-linked from its true selfand controlled by a consciousness that wishes to destroy our compassion andinner goodness would allow this to happen. There is a British cabinet ministerand outspoken Christian dogmatist who has ridiculed vegetarians at everyopportunity. “If God had wanted us to be vegetarians”, he said, “He would havegiven us three stomachs.” In reply you could say that if God had wanted us totalk such baloney He/She would not have given us a brain.(10) To hide the realities of the system and its corruption you need ‘SecurityServices’ and other organisations dedicated to secrecy. It is claimed that theyare required to keep an eye on potential threats from other countries andterrorist groups and to safeguard national security but, as we have seen, themain aim of governments and the secrecy services is to keep truth from their ownpeople. This is vital if the system is going to survive. Truth to the system islike garlic to a vampire. The security services spend more time spying on thosepeacefully challenging the status quo than they do on potential terrorists. Theyknow and manipulate the terrorists, anyway, and indeed engage in terrorismthemselves. All sorts of underhand manoeuvring goes on to stop any individual orgroup which they fear may be vehicles for effectively challenging the system.Frame-ups, phone taps, agents provocateurs, even murder; all these methods areused by the state and the global Brotherhood and its representatives to stopthose who present a threat to their continuing control.(11) Into all that I have said, another fundamental limitation on the system’sfurther expansion must be added. It is the most important factor of all. If youdemand that every year you consume more, you dismantle the planet on which weall depend. Even the land is treated like a factory floor. It has been soexploited with chemicals to maximise short term production that its ability togo on producing is being reduced every year. If you had a machine that producedthe essentials of human survival and it was the only machine of its kind thatexisted, what would people say if you took a sledgehammer to this machine andbashed it into tiny pieces? People would say you were bonkers, crazy, mad, manysandwiches short of a picnic. Well that is exactly what the human race is doingto the planet. Every year through this Industrial Revolution we have taken more‘resources’ from the Earth and turned them into more pollution in the name of‘progress.’ In doing this, the system has had to increase the number of productsthat are disposable and thrown away as soon as possible after purchase. Only inthis way can you increase production. You can’t do it if you make things tolast. This economic necessity under the rules of the system has given us thedisposable cup, knife, fork, plate, razor, etc, and an ever-increasing amount ofthrowaway packaging. Something that is used once and thrown away is an orgasmicexperience for the system; anything that is made to last as long as possible ispotentially fatal. As I have said, the United States is on the front line ofthis suicide, but most of the world is involved also. We have created such amonster that the more successful it is in its own terms, the quicker it destroysthe planet. But we still have politicians talking of the need to return to fullemployment. Under the rules of the present system, full employment of thetraditional kind across the world would leave the planet a waste land. It isutter, utter, insanity. It cannot go on and it will not go on.The consequences of this system of self-destruction have created a world inwhich 20 per cent of the population consume 80 per cent of the ‘resources’ everyyear; the other 80 per cent of humanity must go without their needs so that thesystem can pander to greed. People throughout the world die from the diseases oftoo little, while elsewhere others die from the diseases of too much. It hasproduced a world full of conflict and division, one in which pain, suffering,exploitation and war are essential to the system’s survival.The Brotherhood, which has created and orchestrated this system for its ownends, know it is a nonsense and after its planned coup on the human race, thefirst thing it will do is dismantle the system they have imposed:“You understand perfectly that economic arrangements of this kind, which havebeen suggested to the Goyim by us, cannot be carried on by us.” (Protocol 20.)They know the System’s stupid. It is supposed to be!But let me stress one point above all others. The enslaving consciousness andthe pressures of this planet may make it more difficult to express our trueselves, but it does not make it impossible. You only have to look around yourown community and the world in general to see wonderful, loving, caring andgenerous people. We don’t have to be robots or be controlled by the Brotherhoodand the Luciferic thought patterns; we allow ourselves to be and we can stopdoing so. We see enough in our own lives and elsewhere to know what isacceptable and what is not; we all have the opportunity to start to think forourselves and live what we believe; we can all open our minds and re-connectwith our higher consciousness. Millions are doing this today and many othershave done so throughout history even through these traumatic centuries in thelife of Planet Earth. It doesn’t have to be like this and we don’t have to belike this. Humanity is in nature good, not evil. We can express that goodness ifwe choose to. How strong is our will to resist the urgings of the Lucifericconsciousness? How strong our desire to follow our own heart?The present transformation will bring – is bringing – change of anincomprehensible scale. The Luciferic control of human consciousness is beingremoved and it will be both a time of turmoil and glorious opportunity. Clearlyit is a transformation that has arrived not a moment too soon."},{"pageContent":"12The New World OrderI can understand if some people are having trouble with the mental gymnasticsdemanded by this book.After all, your consciousness is being challenged to reject the accepted historyof humankind, and to see through the smokescreen that much of it is. This is notalways easy when you have been through the education (indoctrination) system,and the establishment version of past, present, and future which is constantlyfed to us through the media minute by minute. And in a world in which the ‘norm’is to laugh at the idea of UFOs and extra-terrestrials, you are being presentedwith a view that suggests that, far from not existing, ETs of both positive andnegative intent have been a fundamental influence on human affairs.Perhaps most difficult of all to accept is that a Brotherhood was set upthousands of years ago to initiate an elite into the spiritual ‘truths’, whiletwisting those truths enough to con the initiates into manipulating everyoneelse; and that today this same Brotherhood has progressed to the point where itcontrols most of the world’s political, economic and secret service activity.From the perspective of life which the system encourages to us to believe, allof this appears to be simply ridiculous, quite outrageous and over the top. ThatIcke must be a candidate for the funny farm, eh? But that is exactly what youare supposed to think. Human beings are indoctrinated with such an inaccurateversion of history and of reality that even if the suppression fails and truthcomes out, it is so different from the indoctrinated version, that people justlaugh and say it’s off the wall. What was it that Hitler said? “The bigger thelie, the more will believe it.”“If in regard to the external foe it is allowed and not considered immoral tokeep the enemy in ignorance of plans to attack him by night or in superiornumbers, then in what way can the same means in regard to the worse foe, thedestroyer of the structure of society and the commonweal (sic), be calledimmoral and not permissible?” (Illuminati Protocol 1).I am not suggesting that this Brotherhood has mind-controlled its millions ofmembers worldwide into knowingly dedicating their lives to the ‘Great Work ofAges’ called world domination. As I keep on stressing, the overwhelming majoritywill not know what they are a part of. It is as vital for the elite to keep themin the dark as it is for the mass of the population to be kept in ignorance. Itcouldn’t work if the membership knew the game plan because most would wantnothing to do with it, and the Brotherhood branches, like the freemasons, needan acceptable public face to hide behind. Their members below certain levels ofinitiation provide that with their dinner dances and their charity work. It’sthe same with most of the others. Even lower levels of the secret societies areused for manipulation of local councils, courts, commerce and police officers,but most supporters of the Brotherhood are very decent, kind, people. It is theelite we need to concern ourselves with and, at least in the great majority ofcases, that does not even include politicians. They are pawns like everyoneelse. Those who work within the Brotherhood societies at the lower levels andhaven’t realised the true agenda, no longer have the excuse of ignorance. TheIlluminati Protocols make clear that the masonic lodges and the lower degreespeopled by what they call “Goy cattle” are merely there to provide the elitewith “a show army…..in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows”. Theseunsuspecting, naive, masons should understand that they are expendable, too, inthe eyes of the Illuminati. Everyone is. The elite’s obsession with worlddomination is their sole, driving motivation. One Illuminati protocol points outthat what it calls “Goy Masons” who know too much will be dealt with after theelite “come into their Kingdom”. Another says:“We execute masons in such wise (sic) that none save the brotherhood can everhave a suspicion of it, not even the victims themselves of our death sentence,they all die when required as if from a normal kind of illness. Knowing this,even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. While teaching Liberalism tothe Goyim we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state ofunquestioning submission.” (Protocol 15).Even the Brotherhood elite has not been – and still is not today – in totalcontrol of everything. They have had some colossal failures I’m sure, and theyhave had periods through history when they have been less effective than atother times. But as each successive generation within the Brotherhood has passedon the initiations and indoctrination to the next one, its power to affect anddecide the outcome of events has grown, particularly over the last two hundredyears, as global communications and the world financial system have allowedenormous power to be held by the very few. The Brotherhood now pervades everyarea of our lives, and through the media which it also controls it can drip feedthe population in ways it could never do before. Their plan to dominate theworld, which goes under the name of the New World Order is reaching itsconclusion – if we don’t wake up fast. In his period as President of the UnitedStates, George Bush even used those words New World Order to describe his visionof the future after the Gulf War and this term is now widely used by politiciansin general.The Brotherhood elite which includes the Rothschild and Rockefeller empires nowhave six main front organisations for their covert activities. They are theCouncil on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, theBilderberg Group, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the UnitedNations. All of these came directly, or indirectly, from the Round Table secretsociety set up by the freemason, Cecil Rhodes, and the Round Table still standsat the centre of this empire of control. Around that symbolic table sit the fewwho direct the world’s political and economic affairs. This empire is, ineffect, the World Government in waiting, waiting that is, to become the officialone.The aptly named Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68th Street in New York is theheadquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations. It was started withRockefeller money in 1921. We have seen how this ‘think tank’ controlled eventsduring the Second World War and it has continued to do so. Appointees from theCFR have been numerous and prominent within successive United Statesadministrations, banking, business, the media and the universities, and theforeign and domestic policy of a supposedly free and democratic nation iscontrolled by this non-elected Brotherhood front group. If they direct USforeign policy, of course, they do so for the world. The CFR has affiliatedorganisations right across the US. It is the American arm of the Royal Instituteof International Affairs in London, which is also known as ‘Chatham House’. Thiswas set up in 1920 and these two ‘think tanks’ working in concert are the reasonfor the so-called ‘special relationship’ between Britain and the USA, and wasresponsible also for manipulating the Americans into the Second World War. Butcontrary to popular belief, it is Britain, at the Brotherhood level, that is thedominant partner of the two. The Royal Institute is obviously very influentialin the foreign policy of the United Kingdom, and other countries have similarorganisations under its influence. The RIIA is a registered charity with theQueen as its patron. It is supported by a stream of global oil companies,multi-nationals, and leading media organisations, including the BBC and itsWorld Service. (Source: the RIIA Annual Report 1992-93). The TrilateralCommission was launched by David Rockefeller, the chairman of the ChaseManhattan Bank and head of the Rockefeller family empire. It was made public in1973, but almost certainly existed in secret in 1972. The Commission consists ofinvited financiers, industrialists, media moguls, union leaders, and politiciansfrom North America, Western Europe and Japan, and its aim is to control thecourse of international events, in order to protect and expand the interests ofthe elite in those three areas of the world. The symbolism of the triangleshould be noted. It is a major Brotherhood symbol. Within three years of goingpublic the Commission had achieved its ambition of installing the firstTrilateralist president in the White House, Jimmy Carter, and his ‘NationalSecurity Adviser’ was Zbigniew Brzezinski, the commission’s first director and aleading inspiration behind its formation. Carter filled his administration withTrilateralists, among them his Vice-President, Walter Mondale, and Secretary ofState, Cyrus Vance.The Bilderberg Group is another forum for Europe’s and America’s leadingpoliticians, financiers, industrialists, media executives, and military leadersto discuss the course of human affairs. The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are thepower behind the Bilderberg Group, which is the European and NATO connectionwithin the Brotherhood empire and the most powerful of these ‘front’organisations. The Bilderberg meetings were started, yet again with Rockefellerand Rothschild money, by Prince Bernhard of the House of Orange in theNetherlands. The name Bilderberg comes from the hotel in the Netherlands wherethe group first met in 1954, though the existence of the group was denied formany years. Prince Bernhard was a member of the SS before the war and anemployee of I.G. Farben. After marrying into the House of Orange he becamechairman of Shell Oil. He chaired the Bilderberg meetings until 1976 when he wasforced to resign in the Lockhead corruption scandal. Bilderberg meetings areheld in strict secrecy, and only if you know an insider can you find outanything of their discussions. Lord Carrington, the former British cabinetminister and Secretary-General of NATO, is a prominent Bilderberger, and becamechairman in 1991. He is also a president of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. He works closely with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, and withHenry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State. Kissinger is a Bilderberger,a Trilateralist and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. LordCarrington was a founding board member of Kissinger Associates. Both are also onthe board of the Hollinger Corporation (chairman Conrad Black, a Bilderbergerand owner of the London Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post).The Club of Rome is another ‘think tank’ organisation which claims to bedeveloping a strategy for the survival of the planet and it, too, supports theidea of centralised planning and world government. Finally, there is the UnitedNations which is based in New York on land given by the Rockefellers. The planfor the UN was hatched during the last War by a secret steering committee of theCouncil on Foreign Relations. The UN was sold to the world under the cloak ofpursuing peace among nations. Unlike its predecessor, the League of Nations,this one was going to stick and serve the Brotherhood. If one world war wouldn’tpersuade governments to do as the elite required, give them another one; thatdid it. For United Nations read United States, and for USA and UN read New WorldOrder.The Round Table and its subsidiaries control the United Nations. It was theircreation and on all decisions that matter they call the shots. Alongside thishave come the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the ground isnow being prepared for a world army under UN (Brotherhood) control. NATO isalready run by the Brotherhood. Conflicts are being triggered and inflamedacross the globe to soften up public opinion to accept this as the only way todeal with the gathering violence. The more horrendous the pictures the mediabroadcast from the world trouble spots, the better it is for those who want acentrally-controlled world army. The UN Secretary General Dr. Boutros BoutrosGhali (a Brotherhood stooge) has already called for a permanent, heavily armed,UN force to be in situ as soon as possible. At a meeting of the Bilderberg Groupat Baden Baden, Germany, in 1991, Henry Kissinger, is reported in the USinvestigative newspaper, Spotlight to have said: “A UN army must be able to actimmediately, without the delays involved in each country making its owndecisions on whether to participate based on parochial considerations”.Governments don’t run the world – the Brotherhood does. You can’t even run forthe presidential nomination within your own party in America without enormoussums of money behind you, and without massive financial backing you have got nochance of running for the presidency itself. Once you have accepted that, thereare favours to be paid off, and if you are not willing to play the game, youwon’t be supported by the financiers anyway. Politicians are not usually privyto the whole Brotherhood plot, even if they are members. They are only told whatthey need to know, and those who are invited to attend the Bilderberg meetingsare there to be fed the Brotherhood line of the best way to run the world. It isthe Bilderberg Group’s permanent executive that runs the show, as it is withthese other front organisations. One of those invited to the Baden Baden meetingof the Bilderbergers in 1991, incidentally, was the then governor of Arkansas,one Bill Clinton, who went on to become President. He would not have becomePresident unless the elite wanted him to.*The aim of the Illuminati is the introduction of a world government to whichevery continent would be subordinate. It would dictate foreign policy andcontrol the world army. Underpinning everything would be a world central bankbased on the lines of the national central banks of today, and there would beone currency controlled entirely by them. It also wishes to go further and turnthe people of the planet literally into robots in ways that I will highlightshortly. If you look at the world today you can see how nations are alreadylosing the power to make decisions to giant trading blocs like the EuropeanUnion and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In Europe the move istowards one currency and one European Central Bank. The pieces are being movedaround the board in preparation for the ‘sting’. It is revealing to note, also,how so many politicians who oppose this loss of national sovereignty suddenlyfind themselves discredited and have their power removed. Spotlight reported inMay 1989 that the Bilderberg meeting that month on La Toja Island, off Spain,had decided that Margaret Thatcher would be removed as British Prime Minister,because of her “refusal to yield British sovereignty to the European Superstatethat is to emerge after 1992”. That is exactly what happened when she wasremoved while in office by her own side, the British Conservative Party in 1990.It was a Brotherhood coup, nothing less, to ease the way to a United States ofEurope. The latest GATT Agreement which opens more borders to ‘free’ world tradeis another creation of the Brotherhood elite to destroy a country’s ability tomake its own economic decisions.The game plan is this. The Brotherhood, manipulated by its Illuminati elite, hasbeen working to create conflict across the world on all levels. This is goinginto overdrive now. They are also undermining the world economy, which theycontrol, to destroy what remains of the confidence the population has inpoliticians and governments. The Brotherhood has ensured that people of limitedability, intellect and vision – puppets – have reached the top in politics, andthis has had two main effects. It has made sure they were easy to manipulate bythe Brotherhood ‘advisors’ behind the scenes, and their obvious lack of abilityhas helped to remove the credibility still further of politics and politicians.This is exactly what the plan has always been in preparation for the economiccollapse they will engineer.“The hatred (of the present order) will be further magnified by the effects ofan economic crisis which will stop the dealings on the exchanges and bringindustry to a standstill. We shall create by all subterranean methods open tous…..a universal economic crisis whereby we shall throw upon the streets wholemobs of workers simultaneously. These mobs will rush delightedly to shed theblood of those whom, in the simplicity of their ignorance, they have envied fromtheir cradles, and whose property they will then be able to loot. Ours they willnot touch, because the moment of attack will be known to us and we shall takemeasures to protect our own.” (Illuminati Protocol 3).This is the culmination of the long term plan to create dependence through the‘Welfare State’. First they removed the independence of people by making themdependent on working for the military-industrial system. Then they squeezed thenumber of jobs and made more and more people dependent on so-called handouts,while taking away all alternatives of a self-reliant lifestyle that was notdependent on the Brotherhood economic system. Now they are using thatmanufactured dependence to further manipulate. They are reducing social securitypayments and will seek to force people to work for the state in return for apittance called ‘unemployment benefit’ or whatever. What they want to create isan underclass of bitterness which will trigger civil war between the haves andhave nots. They also wish to crush the human spirit and make it too weary toresist the New World Order, and even to welcome it as their saviour. When thingshave got so bad, in terms of the economy, wars, and disease, and the world is inutter chaos, along will come the Brotherhood with its mask of compassion andbenevolence and promise to put everything right. What they won’t say is that theills they will pledge themselves to remove are the very ills they haveorchestrated to programme the human mind. They will blame it all on thepoliticians they have controlled and the system they have created. Thebombardment of the human mind with constant horrors through the media is apolicy known as ‘Future Shock’. It is designed to deaden the mind and make itbelieve it is impotent in the face of so many immense problems.“It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proceeds. We have in our servicepersons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating monarchists, demagogues,socialists, communists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessedthem all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at thelast remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established forms oforder. By these acts all states are in torture; they exhort to tranquility, areready to sacrifice everything for peace: but we will not give them peace untilthey openly acknowledge our international super-government, and withsubmissiveness. . .“. . . To produce the possibility of the expression of such wishes by all thenations it is indispensible to trouble in all countries the people’s relationswith their governments so as to utterly exhaust humanity with dissension,hatred, struggle, envy and even by the use of torture, by starvation, by theinoculation of diseases [Aids], by want, so that the Goyim sees no other issuethan to take refuge in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else. But ifwe give the nations of the world a breathing space the moment we long for ishardly likely ever to arrive . . .“. . . When we have accomplished our coup d’état we shall say then to thevarious peoples: ‘Everything has gone terribly badly, all have been worn outwith the sufferings. We are destroying the causes of your torment –nationalities, frontiers, differences of coinages’….. Then the mob will exalt usand bear us up in their hands in a unanimous triumph of hopes and expectations.”(Illuminati Protocol 10)It is time for those politicians and their supporters who genuinely want freedomto come together and stop squabbling over irrelevant, Brotherhood-manufactured,differences. You are all being used to fight a phoney political war! Throughoutthis century in Britain and other countries the political battle has gone onbetween left, right, and centre while all the time the strings of everypolitical shade are being pulled by the same people. Wake Up. Elements withinthe Fabian Society have manipulated the UK Labour Party, and trades union andother ‘workers organisations’, political and non-political, are being used tobring about the fascist World Government, mostly without realising it:“We shall raise the rate of wages which, however, will not bring any advantageto the workers, for, at the same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of thefirst necessities of life…..we shall further undermine artfully and deeplysources of production, by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkenessand side by side therewith taking all measure to extirpate from the face of theearth all the educated forces of the goyim. In order that the true meaning ofthings may not strike the goyim before the proper time we shall mask it under analleged ardent desire to serve the working classes and the great principles ofthe political economy about which our economic theories are carrying on anenergetic propaganda.” (Protocol 6).Behind this attempt to complete the ‘Great Work of Ages’ are some of the samemystical teachings of the infiltrated Brotherhood and its mystery schools whichgo back at least as far as ancient Egypt and Babylon. On one level the New WorldOrder would appear, according to some, to include the crowning of a ‘Messiah’,the Second Coming of a World King in around the year 2,000. The crowning isplanned to take place in a rebuilt Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, which wouldreplace the Moslem mosque currently on that site. This new Messiah would seem tobe someone (at least in the Brotherhood’s misguided mind) claiming a bloodlineback to King David via Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and their offspring. This is whatthe Knights Templars were dedicated to doing (and still are in the guise of theFreemasons) and the Priory of Sion still exists and continues to pursue thisbizarre ambition, along with its long held goal of a “United States of Europe”.Another aim of the New World Order is for one World Church – its own – based onthe beliefs of the Templars. Some researchers believe that the ‘World King’ ispart of a bloodline going back to the last Roman Emperor. Like I say, it doesn’tmatter if you believe this nonsense followed by the Brotherhood, as long as theybelieve it, we are all affected. The Illuminati are not stupid, but they arevery strange people.According to Sumer tablets and freemasonic legend, there was a supernova ormassive explosion in the heavens in the ancient period. It has been claimed thatthe grand gallery in the Great Pyramid at Giza is focused on the area of thesouthern sky where the supernova would have been seen in the triangle of starscalled Zeta Puppis, Gamma Velorum, and Lambda Velorum. Some scientists haveidentified pulses which they believe to be radio waves caused by a star whichblew apart around 4,000BC. The Sumerian star catalogue, which has been shown tobe very accurate, predicted that the blazing star would be seen again on Earthin 6,000 years – around now. Perhaps the Brotherhood intends to use what itbelieves to be the return of that exploding star to usher in its New World Orderand the world king. If it can cause so much mayhem in the world before then,people will be only too willing to believe in some Second Coming to bring‘peace’ to humanity – especially if this is combined with amazing sights in thesky. I don’t know what goes on the minds of the Brotherhood, because the realityof life has been so muddled in their consciousness by the Luciferic forces andthe indoctrination of the ages, that goodness knows what they believe or willseek to achieve. The overall ambition, however, remains the same. To imprisonthe human race, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically.Investigators of the New World Order and Brotherhood history come from allshades of belief. Among them are Christian fanatics and those, like me, whothink that religion is a curse on the world. There are some who have gotinterested in the subject from the economic point of view, while others havecome into this area of investigation via science, the New Age, the securityservices, UFO groups, etc. There are some I would not choose to spend an eveningwith and others who are calling for the Illuminati to be hanged, which is, tosay the least, hardly my own approach! In short, the investigators come frommany belief systems and this makes even more compelling the enormous area ofagreement between them on the main themes of the conspiracy I am outlining.I emphasise the need to keep our eyes on the themes and not get too bogged downwith every detail, because there is a great deal of disinformation flyingaround. You have to be aware of the double-bluff – the leaking of information bythe Brotherhood to take researchers off the trail. The Brotherhood intelligencenetwork has infiltrated many New Age, UFO, and investigative groups and you haveto be careful not to believe everything claimed by apparent ‘opponents’ of theNew World Order. Remember how the Brotherhood works. This whole area is teemingwith ‘ex CIA’ men claiming to have seen the light and anxious to tell the publicthe truth. In some cases they might be genuine, in many they will not.The most effective form of disinformation is when truth is mixed with fictionwhich can easily be shown to be inaccurate. This way you achieve two things. Youdiscredit the investigators by proving that some of their claims are wrong, andyou discredit in the public mind the other information they have put out whichis true. It is vital that when some information genuinely released by writersand researchers is proved to be false that people don’t at the same time rejecteverything else they are saying. That is what you are meant to do. And, anyway,why if the authorities have nothing to hide are they putting out disinformationin the first place? The whole idea is to confuse and this not only applies toNew World Order investigators, but also the public in general.“In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state ofbewilderment by giving expression from all sides to so many contradictoryopinions and for such length of time as will suffice to make the Goyim losetheir heads in the labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have noopinion of any kind in matters political.” (Protocol 5).Whenever I hear someone say “I never discuss politics or religion” as if that isa virtue, I feel like screaming. Crucial to the Illuminati cover-up, thepublishing of disinformation and the discrediting of investigators like myself,is the press and the media. I will talk more of this in a later chapter, butsuffice to say now that the world media is almost totally under Brotherhoodcontrol and where they don’t actually run the publication, they control the‘information’ that it receives. Most journalists (and there are some honorableexceptions) are in a mental prison, again most of them without realising it. Ihave met many who clearly think they are street-wise about the world when ifthey only opened their eyes they would see that they are little more than copytypists for the manipulators. They largely ‘investigate’ irrelevances orsubjects which suit the Brotherhood’s desired plan. What the public really needto know is never addressed. I heard Harold Evans, the former editor of theLondon Times and Sunday Times, talking on the radio of the appalling way themedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch, his former boss, runs his vast world newspaper andbroadcasting empire to suit his own commercial and political interests (and whoelse’s?). Evans described how Margaret Thatcher in her years as British PrimeMinister was “Murdoch’s poodle” who did as she was told in matters relating tohim.I found it particularly interesting in the light of this book, that Evans alsomade the point that while American journalists were committing endless time,money and energy into investigating the bedroom habits of Bill Clinton and thefinancial affairs of his wife, the terrible effect of the Federal Reserve Boardon the US economy went unchallenged. But then, after what this book hasrevealed, that is no longer a surprise, is it? Most so-called professionaljournalists are irrelevant to real information-gathering and communication. Thatis being done by researchers who have the courage to search for truth and by themagazines now springing into life which are prepared to print it.John Swainton, a long-time Chief of Staff at the prestigious New York Times, inthe 1860s and ’70s said in a retirement speech to his staff:“There is no such thing as a free press. You know it and I know it. There’s notone of you who would dare to write his honest opinions. The business of ajournalist is to destroy truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawnat the feet of Mammon, and to sell himself, his country and his race for hisdaily bread. We are tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We arejumping jacks; they pull the strings, we dance; our talents, our possibilitiesand our lives are the property of these men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”*The main difference between researchers of the New World Order is over theinvolvement or not of extra-terrestrials in all this. I have made it clear inthe book that I do believe ETs exist and that they seeded the human form as weknow it. I feel their direct involvement, on Earth at least, was dramaticallyreduced after Atlantis, Egypt, and Babylon, but I feel they have continued tohave an effect, both positive and negative, on human evolution. I think theyhave worked through human consciousness and when you see in due course the mindcontrolling techniques available to the Illuminati’s human scientists andmanipulators, you will appreciate that anything is possible forextra-terrestrials who are far in advance of us technologically and in theirmind-controlling potential. It is important to remember also, given the themes Ihave been suggesting through human history, that the ETs have had this knowledgeand potential throughout the period covered by this book. It could well be thatnegative ETs (by far the minority) have control of the minds of the Illuminati.The Illuminati are victims, too, and mind-controlled to mind control everyoneelse since ancient times. That is not to say that I accept all the UFO stories.There is a great deal of disinformation being put about to confuse and divertand I feel that some claims about UFOs are being used to cover up Brotherhoodactivities, for reasons I will explain later. But for the moment, let us look atthe evidence for the direct involvement of ETs on Earth today.Human history is littered with stories of strange lights and ‘gods’ in the sky,unidentified flying objects, and the appearance of ET-type figures. Of coursenot all will be genuine, and there were probably non-UFO explanations for mostof them, but it is silly just to write them all off as some people do. Thereports increased in modern times from the early 1940s and a number of incidentshave been reported of extra-terrestrial bodies being found. The most famous isknown as the Roswell incident which has been documented by many researchers,including Tim Good in his books on the subject.On July 2nd 1947, the story goes, at least one spacecraft crashed during a stormin the New Mexico desert near a place called Corona, seventy-five milesnorth-west of Roswell. The crash left a trail of debris a mile long and ahundred yards wide. A ranch hand, ‘Mac’ Brazel, picked up some of the remains,strange pieces of metal which were incredibly light and strong which had writtenupon them geometrical symbols and hieroglyphics. The ranch hand didn’t tell theauthorities about this find for several days and when he did some personnel fromthe Roswell army-air base arrived to investigate. After they reported to thebase commander he authorised a press release announcing they had found a flyingsaucer. This was printed in the local papers and one report said:“The office of the 509th bombardment group at Roswell Army Air Field announcedat Noon today that the field was in possession of a flying saucer.”Suddenly the higher levels of the military arrived on the scene and the cover-upbegan. They withdrew the press release and launched a weather balloon which theyimmediately caused to crash. They made this available for press picturesclaiming that the balloon and not a flying saucer had been found. Meanwhile, inanother area of the crash site, a civil engineer working on an irrigationproject and a group of archeologists found four extra-terrestrials. Three weredead and one was still alive, so the story says. They were described as three tofour feet tall wearing very tight, spacesuit-type clothing, but with no cover onthe heads or hands. The military closed off the entire area and those who saweither the crashed craft or the bodies were threatened by the authorities andwarned of the consequences if they revealed what they had seen. The local radiostation, KGFL New Mexico, was visited by the military after recording aninterview with a witness and told that if they wanted to be on the airtwenty-four hours later they should hand over the interview and forget it everhappened. This they did. A local mortician who accidentally looked into anoperating theatre and saw one of the extra-terrestrial bodies was told that hewould be ‘dead bones’ if he opened his mouth. A soldier, Sergeant Melvin EBrown, was told to guard something without being told what it was. When heinvestigated he found extra-terrestrial bodies. Brown told his family verylittle, but his daughters remember him saying that the bodies he saw had largerheads than humans, and no hair. They looked yellowy in colour and their slantedeyes reminded him of the Chinese. It could have been this race that ‘seeded’ theChinese, perhaps. The extra-terrestrial races that visit the Earth are many anddiverse, and therefore, so are the races of the Earth which they originallycreated, and possibly continue to affect genetically. Brown was terrified toreveal anything more of what he knew to his dying day, but now people arebeginning to speak out and describe their experiences. More than two hundredpeople witnessed something of this story, it is claimed.There has been much speculation about the events that followed the discovery ofthese craft and their occupants in a number of incidents during the 1940s and’50s. Many investigators and insider informants have said that an ET was foundalive in another incident near Roswell in 1949. He was given the name ‘EBE’ orExtra-terrestrial Biological Entity, and lived until 1952. His metabolism workedmuch like a plant, with nourishment absorbed through the skin. EBE, and otherETs found alive over the years, passed on some astonishing information to theAmericans, it is said, which transformed their understanding of Creation and theorigins of the human race as we know it. What they were told, according to somewriters, supports the themes of ET activity and ‘seeding’ of the human form byETs. A few researchers, especially the former member of American NavalIntelligence, Bill Cooper, go much further than most and claim a possible secretconspiracy between the Illuminati and a race of negative ETs which, he believescould have started in the 1950s. He highlights this in his book, Behold a PaleHorse. In summary, he suggests the following hypothesis based on what he saw inNaval Intelligence and what he has been told by his ‘contacts’ since then. Tosave putting the next few paragraphs in quotes or adding in endless “Coopersays” or “Cooper claims”, please keep in mind throughout this little sectionthat the following is what Bill Cooper has said and not me.Cooper reckons that following the information passed on by the EBE, ProjectSign, later called Project Grudge, was launched to investigate what was goingon. Another project, called Blue Book, was formed to issue disinformation andhamper outside investigations. President Truman formed the National SecurityAgency in 1952 by secret executive order with the task of starting acommunication with the ETs. The National Security Agency (NSA) is not subject toany laws in the United States which do not specifically mention it by name. Thework of the NSA is about as secret as you can get, and it is by far the mostimportant arm of the American intelligence agencies. It attracts most of thefunding. Truman told the highest levels of the allies and the Soviet Union ofwhat had been found. The NSA’s main job was to find ways of communicating withthe ETs and establish the background to their activity. This was done though aspecial project code named SIGMA.Dwight D Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in World War II, becamePresident in 1953 thanks to encouragement and support from the Rockefellers. Hewas another president from the Council on Foreign Relations. More spacecraft andextra-terrestrials were found and he engaged his friend and CFR member NelsonRockefeller to help with the ET problem. Rockefeller used the opportunity torestructure the administration of government to make it easier to manipulate,after he was made chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee onGovernmental Organisation.Nelson Rockefeller was a Republican who was elected governor of New York Statefour times and rose to the position of Assistant Secretary of State underRoosevelt, even though that was a Democratic administration. He would laterbecome Vice-President after twice losing to Richard Nixon in the race for theRepublican Presidential nomination.Communications were eventually made with a race of ETs who claimed to come froma planet linked to the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. (Otherresearchers name different star systems in relation to these ETs). Thecommunications were made thanks to the work of Project SIGMA. The ETs took ahigh orbit over the Equator and the Americans, says Cooper, used computer binarylanguage to set up a landing and face-to-face meeting. This happened in 1954when a group of ETs landed at the Holloman Air Force base and later at theEdwards Air Force Base where they met Eisenhower himself. Both the landings andthe meeting were filmed, apparently, and somewhere the film still exists.The claims about this meeting are supported by other sources. It is known thatEisenhower was on vacation in Palm Springs, playing golf at this time. He wasstaying with his friend Paul Roy Helms at the Smoke Tree Ranch, but on therelevant day 20th February 1954, he ‘went missing’ for four hours. This wouldhave given him plenty of time to get to the Edwards Air Force Base (then calledMuroc), to attend the meeting. The official explanation for his disappearancewas that he had to visit a local dentist after losing a cap on his tooth whileeating a chicken leg. No proof of this has ever been offered. The meeting withthe ETs led to an agreement. They would not interfere with human affairs so longas their presence was kept a secret, and they were allowed to abduct a certainnumber of people for research purposes because they had major problems on theirown planet, particularly with reproduction. The ETs said the humans would haveno memory of the abductions, because of their ability to programme the mind. TheAmericans agreed to a limited number of abductions on the understanding that thehumans would not be harmed, and in return the ETs said they would pass on highlyadvanced technology and the knowledge of how to time-travel.It was agreed that the ETs would not work with any other nation, and that therewould be an exchange of personnel and ‘ambassadors’. Underground bases would beestablished in the United States for the extra-terrestrials and for the exchangeof technology. These were to be under Indian Reservations in the area known asFour Corners in Utah, and in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and a location knownas Area 51 or ‘Dreamland’ near Groom Lake in Nevada. The ETs began to pass ontheir technology here in a nearby area called S-4, code named the Dark Side ofthe Moon. Project Redlight was created to begin the experimental flights of theET technology now in US hands, and various projects were begun to maintain totalsecrecy of what was happening. Project Snowbird had the task of rubbishing anyreports of ‘UFOs’ over the United States. One way they did this was to show thepress what experiments they were doing with conventional technology which theyused as a way to explain some UFO sightings. In fact they had technology toovercome gravity, and they had their own spacecraft in the 1950s which, bycomparison, make today’s Space Shuttle look like the technological equivalent ofa London taxi. The Space Shuttle, like the technology used in the ‘first’ Moonlanding, is a con, a cover for what is really going on.Cooper says the underground facilities were paid for with a secret fundadministered by the Military Office in the White House. This money was launderedmany times before it reached its destination, to mask the origin and purpose.Eisenhower was the last president to know what was really going on, and laterpresidents who asked about the fund were told it: was to build undergroundshelters for the government in times of war. President Lyndon Johnson used it tobuild a cinema and a road on his ranch, because he had no idea of its truepurpose. There are now, Bill Cooper says, underground sites for the military andETs all over the States according to “information” he has seen. Most presidentsafter Eisenhower have been told only that extra-terrestrials with problems ontheir own planet want to settle here and are handing over incredible gifts oftechnology in return. Some have known nothing.Eisenhower set up a permanent committee to supervise all covert operationsrelating to the ETs. It was called the Majesty 12 (MJ-12) and consisted,according to Cooper’s research, of Nelson Rockefeller, CIA Director Allen WelshDulles, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Secretary of Defence Charles EWilson, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Arthur W Radford, theFBI Director J Edgar Hoover, and six men from the executive committee of theCouncil on Foreign Relations. These were known as the ‘Wise Men’ and they wereall members of a secret society called the Jason Society or the Jason Scholars.These recruited members from the Skull and Bones and the Scroll and Key secretsocieties at the Yale and Harvard Universities. George Bush was a member of theSkull and Bones and would later join the Council on Foreign Relations and becomehead of the CIA. MJ-12 has had many changes of name over the years, according toCooper. Under Eisenhower and Kennedy it was called the Special Group; underJohnson it was the 303 Committee; under Nixon, Ford, and Carter it became the 40Committee, and under Reagan it was known as Pl-40. More recently there has beenan attempt to promote disinformation with a ‘briefing paper’ which mentions anorganisation called Majestic 12. Several presidents, including Carter andReagan, have talked of seeing UFOs before they took office. Carter said duringhis election campaign that, if elected, he would reveal every piece ofinformation available about them to the public and the scientists. Perhaps heintended to, but he never did.Eisenhower soon realised that the ETs were not keeping to their agreement.Mutilated animals and people were being found across the country and manyabductees were clearly not being returned to the Earth. The Americans now foundout that the ETs were interacting with the Soviet Union and that, Cooper says,…....they had been manipulating humanity through the secret societies, mysticismand religion for a very long time. They had control of the mind of Adolf Hitlerand all of those ‘evil’ people who have made humanity suffer so much.Eisenhower established a committee to investigate what was happening. Cooper’ssources say it consisted of members of the Council on Foreign Relations and theJason Society. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the instigator and first director of theTrilateral Commission, was also the director of this new committee for the firsteighteen months with Henry Kissinger taking over from him. This group was calledQuantico II after the marine base at Quantico, Virginia, where its latermeetings took place. Nelson Rockefeller had a retreat built in Maryland whichcould only be reached by air, which he did specifically for meetings of thisgroup and MJ-12. This location was code named the Country Club. In the end theydecided that the only way to proceed was to continue to seek friendly relationswith the ETs. The working relationship has continued ever since although notwithout conflict and disagreements.So that is Bill Cooper’s hypothesis. What do we make of it? Personally, myintuition tells me that some disinformation has been fed to him, but on thebasis that the best disinformation mixes truth with fiction, we should not writeit all off in the rather arrogant way which some have done. No one has amonopoly on truth, especially when the Brotherhood security services aredropping disinformation all over the place. There may have been contact betweenthe US elite and ETs, although it does not have to be physical interaction. Itcould have been through psychic sources which the Illuminati use. To be fair,also, Cooper stresses that the above story is a hypothesis and that he couldwell have been used by the disinformers to fuel the myth of the “alien threat”,a myth that could be employed to justify a global state of emergency andcentralisation of all power. I believe the latter to be at least a very strongpossibility. Whatever the reality it is time for the Pinochio politicians of theworld to get off their knees and start making waves until the truth is revealed.Another ‘insider’ who says he wants people to know what is happening, is BobDean. He says he was a soldier in the US Army for twenty-seven years and waspromoted to Cosmic Top Secret Level, the highest in NATO, while serving at theS.H.A.P.E Headquarters in Europe. According to him, many UFOs were being trackedby NATO forces in the 1950s and ’60s. He suggests that an investigation waslaunched under the cover of a study called ‘An evaluation of a possible militarythreat to Allied Forces in Europe’. It included a report on what were said tohave been twelve ET bodies found in Northern Europe in 1962. The reportconcluded, says Dean, that the planet has been the subject of a detailed surveyby extra-terrestrials of many kinds for hundreds, possibly thousands of years,and their technology was hundreds of years ahead of ours. I certainly agree withthe analysis.Dean quotes Victor Marchetti, a former special assistant to the executivedirector of the CIA, as saying privately in 1979:“We have indeed been contacted, perhaps even visited by, extra-terrestrialbeings, and the US Government, in collusion with the other powers of Europe, isdetermined to keep this information from the general public. The purpose of thisinternational conspiracy is to maintain a working stability between the nationsof the world, and for them, in turn, to maintain institutional control overtheir respective populations.“For these governments to admit that there are beings from outer space withmentalities and technological capabilities obviously far superior to ours,could, once fully perceived by the average person, erode the foundations of theEarth’s traditional power structures.“Political and legal systems, religious, economic and social institutions, couldall become meaningless in the minds of the general public. The nationalhierarchical establishments, even civilisation as we know it, could collapseinto anarchy.”Researcher Tim Good in his books suggests that the RAF have had numerousexperiences with UFOs and that their UFO investigations centre is within theheadquarters of the Provost and Security Services at RAF Rudloe Manor inWiltshire. The UFO Unit, it is said, operates secretly under the cover of anorganisation called the Flying Complaints Flight.This unit is staffed by officers trained in counter-intelligence and it couldwell have been from here that the crop circle phenomenon has been systematicallydestroyed in the public mind. The patterns in the crops have appeared all overthe world, but it was when the amazingly detailed geometric patterns began toappear in Southern England in the early 1990s that the disinformation campaignreally began. Public and media interest reached such a peak at the time thatsomething had to be done to stop it. People were asking questions about possiblecauses, and they were beginning to realise that there was more to life and theUniverse than they had been led to believe. In addition to the few materialistictricksters trying to show that the phenomenon could be easily explained, thereerupted organised campaigns to hoax, and to discredit the best known crop circleinvestigators. People appeared out of nowhere claiming to have made all the cropcircles that had appeared over decades all over the world. Ridiculous as thismay seem, the public, which in general is incredibly gullible, bought the ideathat the phenomenon was all a gigantic hoax. Interest in crop circles slumpeddramatically. They are still appearing, with unhoaxable geometry, but only theenthusiasts know about them now. The media has lost all interest, because it isas gullible and as fickle as the general public, more so in some cases, and, ofcourse, it has a tail to wag and a master to lick. I feel, however, that eventswill bring the crop patterns back onto the public stage.There is certainly a fantastic cover-up going on in the UFO field. But of what?Extra-terrestrials landing here, interacting with the elite, and abducting humanbeings? Or is this all just a smokescreen to hide what is really happening?Other researchers, while agreeing on all the main themes of the New World Orderconspiracy, believe that the claims about extra-terrestrials are alldisinformation and that the genuine UFOs that people report are, in truth, humantechnology. (I think both exist). They say that this advanced technology whichis far ahead of anything the public know about, was not handed over by ETs inunderground bases, but was developed by Illuminati scientists. This, some say,could have begun after the war when the Americans got hold of the work that hadbeen done by Nazi scientists who the Brotherhood made sure escaped from Germany.Certainly it appears that the Nazi scientific and Brotherhood elite haddeveloped anti-gravity technology by the end of the war which used the Earth’snatural energy field for its power. It was so secret, Hitler possibly knewnothing about it because he wasn’t in control of events; the Brotherhood whocontrolled him were. This Nazi technology, it is claimed, looked like the UFOsmany people describe. The American Academy of Dissident Sciences claims to havedetails of this. When I was waiting to be interviewed at a TV Station about thefirst edition of this book, I was stopped by an American in the corridor. “Inthe book”, he said, “Are you saying the American military have got ‘UFO’ typetechnology?” I said that I was. “Are you saying that they keep it at S-4 inNevada?” Again I said yes. “You are right”, he said. “I used to work there andI’ve seen them being flown. It’s an unbelievable sight. You can’t believe whatyou are seeing.”A physicist, Bob Lazar, says he also worked at S-4 and saw the “flying saucers”in the hangers. He says they work through an anti-gravity technology whichinvolves matter and anti-matter annihilating each other and in doing so creatingpower through an electomagnetic field. There is wide agreement that ‘UFO’spacecraft are real, but some researchers say they are built and flown byhumans, not ETs. This theory says that the disinformation about ET landings arejust a way of covering up the technology they have which, if it became generallyavailable, would transform the world economy and free people from so muchdependency on the System – because the technology used to fly these craft is thesame as that which would provide free energy to everyone, without the need touse fossil fuels. It is also highly likely as I have said that the negative UFOtheme is being used in the public mind to prepare for an ‘aliens are coming’announcement which will justify a global state of emergency and centralisedcontrol. Anything is possible.Here we have another fusion of agreement by almost all investigators into thesesubjects. The Brotherhood elite have had, by whatever means, human or ET, theability to travel in space at least since the 1950s and, many researchers agree,they have established bases on the Moon and Mars under a project which hasbecome known as Alternative Three. This was the name of an apparently fictionalstory that is perhaps nearer the truth than was originally thought. Maybe theIlluminati know the planet is about to undergo some great change on all levelsand want some insurance, who knows? What I am sure about is that the first humanlanded on the Moon before 1969. When Apollo 11 touched down with NeilArmstrong’s ‘One small step for man, one giant step for mankind’, it was pureWalt Disney. That ‘giant step’ had happened years earlier with technology far inadvance of Apollo. The astronauts on that ‘first’ Moon landing were, say someresearchers, shocked at what they found there, because like most of the lowerofficials at Mission Control they didn’t know the background to what was goingon. How stunned they must have been, but they knew the price of speaking out.According to Otto Binder, who worked on the NASA space programme, significantsegments of the conversations between Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 11were not made public after they landed on the Moon. He says that people usingVHF receivers to bypass NASA broadcasts heard this conversation:Mission Control: “What the hell was it? What’s there? Malfunction?”Neil Armstrong: “These babies are huge, sir…...enormous. Oh God, you wouldn’tbelieve it. I’m telling you there are other spacecraft out there…..lined up onthe far side of the crater edge…...they’re on the Moon watching us.”Even more amazing, those craft could well have had Americans on board! What ajoke it all is. There is a good chance, too, that the information given to usabout the nature of the Moon and Martian atmospheres is untrue and that it isfar more hospitable than we are led to believe. When, in 1960, President Kennedyagreed a programme to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, heinnocently gave the Brotherhood elite a wonderful vehicle to take out of thegovernment system enormous amounts of money allocated to the ‘official’ spaceprogramme, and channel them into the unofficial one. Researchers suggest thatthe Americans and the Soviet Union, at Brotherhood levels, were working togetherthroughout the so-called Cold War, another Illuminati creation. It was a meansof frightening the populations on both sides into suffering appalling hardships,while their governments spent countless billions on weapons research andconstruction. No doubt there were other reasons, too.There was no prospect of either side using the weapons; that was not the idea.Control by world war was replaced by fear of world war. When one side got toofar ahead technologically, they would pass the information to the other throughthe Brotherhood network. Once the stockpiles reached a certain level, thecreation of more weapons could not be justified, except on the grounds ofneeding to keep ahead of the other side’s technology. If they made sure thatneither was too far advanced of the other, they could both go on demanding, andgetting, more money for new research and development. This was especiallyimportant in America where they at least had to pay lip service to democraticaccountability. Much of that development money was being channelled into theanti-gravity technology coming from either the ETs or their own scientists,depending on your point of view, and into building vast underground bases wheresecrecy was ensured. Again both pro-ET and no-ET researchers largely agree thatthe underground facilities exist, though they may differ on precisely the reasonfor them. Some of the Star Wars budget was used for these secret purposes, too,and for other covert projects unknown to the people, and even to most of theelected government. The USA were opponents of the Soviet Union? Hardly. Thelower levels of both governments and the populations may have thought so, butthe Brotherhood elite on both sides were on the same team and played for thesame captain – Lucifer and possibly the negative ET group working through theirconsciousness.The Illuminati and its Brotherhood offshoots which control the CIA needed, andstill do, a constant stream of massive funding for the covert projects they areinvolved in. These include the sort of things I have been outlining, and all theother manipulations the book has documented, like the support for civil wars anddespotic dictators, which the CIA has secretly supported and brought to power toserve their interests. Next time you see an American president put his hand onhis heart and talk about America standing for freedom, I should sit down beforeyou fall over laughing. One of the main ways the covert projects are funded isthrough illegal drugs. Brotherhood branches and elements within the CIA and someof the world’s other secret services, control the world market in drugs. Cooperand other writers have stated this and it came very close to becoming widelyknown in the wake of the Iran-Contra Affair. Those who have investigated theCIA-drugs connection say it began in the late 1950s. It is claimed that the CIAand other agencies arranged to transport drugs from South America by sea to oilrigs drilling off the US coast. From there they could be brought ashore underthe cover of the oil operations. Now the CIA and other Brotherhood branches likeBritish Intelligence and Mossad, the Israeli agency control the entire worldmarket in illegal drugs. The more the laws are tightened by so-called ‘Wars onDrugs’, the higher the street value. The American authorities have been socommitted to the ‘War on Drugs’ that they have allowed US Oil companies to shipchemicals to South America which are needed to make the drugs. The story of theIran-Contra affair involving Oliver North during the Reagan Administration wasthe tip of a fantastic iceberg, and look at how easily it was covered up. TheAmerican people and media want a rocket directed at their backsides for allowingit to happen. The invasion of Panama by US forces in 1989 which cost so manylives in Operation ‘Just Cause’ and led to the abduction to America of PresidentManuel Noriega, was linked, in part, to the covert drugs operation and the drugmoney laundered through Panama.One name that keeps coming up again and again as I read the work ofinvestigators into all this is George Bush, the member of the Council on ForeignRelations, Trilateralist, former head of the CIA, and President of the UnitedStates before Bill Clinton. He was also the President of Zapata Offshore Oil, itis alleged, when that company’s offshore oil rigs were used to bring in thedrugs in the 1950s. Now it cannot be fair to make accusations like this againstMr Bush as some researchers do if he is innocent in these matters. Surely it isonly right that the claims made about Mr Bush in relation to drugs and hisfamily’s financial interests in Panama, are openly and publicly refuted withundeniable evidence so there can be no stain on his character whatsoever. Thesame applies to allegations about drug-running by the CIA while he was incharge.All evidence points to a coordinated Brotherhood campaign to give young peopleevery opportunity to take and become hooked on drugs. Today, finding drugs isoften no problem for even children. The Brotherhood is at war with the youngpeople of the world. It wishes to see them drugged, their spirits shattered,their minds filled with nonsense. It knows that the energy and natural idealismof the young could cause it problems in its sinister ambitions. It needs tocrush the young, and that is what it is trying to do. It is time for the youngpeople of this planet to open their eyes and refuse to be programmed. TheProtocols make clear how it intended through this century to divert the youngand the “Goyim” in general. They want to stop people thinking for themselves andhow well it has succeeded:“In order that the masses themselves may not guess what they are about wefurther distract them with amusements, games, pastimes, passions, people’spalaces….. Soon we shall begin through the press to propose competitions in art,in sport of all kinds; these interests will finally distract their minds fromquestions in which we should find ourselves compelled to oppose them. Growingmore and more disaccustomed to reflect and form any options of their own, peoplewill begin to talk in the same tone as we, because alone we shall be offeringthem new directions of thought….. of course through such persons as will not besuspected of solidarity with us.” (Illuminati Protocol 13).I don’t want to paint John F Kennedy as being whiter that white because I do notbelieve he was. Some members of the Kennedy family, particularly his father,have been involved in some very sinister operations as documented by otherresearchers over the years. But JFK clearly had a few things in mind that didn’tsuit the Brotherhood. This is why he lost his life in Dallas, Texas, on November22nd 1963. He scraped to power by just 100,000 votes in 1960 and the Brotherhoodpossibly wanted his challenger, Richard Nixon. There is, of course, greatmystery and controversy surrounding (a) who killed Kennedy and (b) why? Whatthere is no controversy about, to anyone with eyes and a brain, is that he wasassassinated in a military-style operation. The ‘evidence’ that he was killed bya ‘lone assassin’ Lee Harvey Oswald is so hysterical, I won’t insult yourintelligence with it. Oswald was involved with the US secret services. He wasset up over a long period of time and the Kennedy assassination was no lastminute decision. It was carefully organised by the Brotherhood secret governmentof the United States. The ‘who?’ is clear to me, but what about the ‘why’?Kennedy was bad news for the Brotherhood elite. He promised to “splinter the CIAinto a thousand pieces”. It is said by some researchers that he had found outabout the drug operation and ordered it to be stopped: he certainly wanted tosort out the Federal Reserve, the cartel of Brotherhood banking interests thatcontrol the American economy and for the US government to print its owninterest-free money; and he wanted to withdraw from the Brotherhood-engineeredVietnam War and end the cold war with the Soviet Union. All these things struckat the very heart of the Brotherhood operations and long term planning. Thoseresearchers who accept the claims about the ET connection say that Kennedy hadalso found out about that, and was planning to reveal it; but I am not sayingthis is correct.The evidence uncovered by the courageous people who would not accept thecover-up has made it crystal clear that Oswald could not have been the assassin,and that the killer bullet came from the other direction. A cine film taken byan onlooker called Abraham Zapruder and suppressed by the government for manyyears makes this obvious, too. Oswald said he had been set up, but he wasconveniently killed by another stooge, the night club owner Jack Ruby, before hecould come to trial. Witnesses who saw things that undermined the cover-upversion of events were harassed, intimidated, or killed. Kennedy’s body wasrushed by plane from Dallas to Washington for autopsy by military pathologistswho would do as they were told and make the ‘correct’ report. Near the scene ofthe assassination today, like some grizzly two fingers to the world, is anobelisk dedicated to freemasonry. This was a Brotherhood coup on the UnitedStates.Kennedy was replaced by his vice-president, Lyndon Johnson, a freemason. It isalleged that Johnson immediately ordered the blood-stained and bullet-holed carto be cleaned and repaired, so destroying more evidence. He also reversedKennedy’s withdrawal policy relating to the Federal Reserve and to Vietnam.Under him the war quickly escalated and when it ended, two million Asian and58,000 American lives had been lost and $220 billion had been spent. The Vietnamwar was a grotesque human and financial killing in the classic Brotherhoodmould. The Cold War also continued and weapons spending increased massively,just as the Brotherhood wanted.Johnson set up the pathetic Warren Commission to ‘investigate’ Kennedy’s death.Earl Warren was a freemason and the whole thing was the most obvious cover-up.Some witnesses said their evidence had been changed and even their signaturesforged. Most of the Commission was made up of people from the Council on ForeignRelations, and the cover-up was completed by 33rd degree mason J Edgar Hoover,the head of the FBI, and yet another freemason, the former CIA Director, AllenWelsh Dulles. Five years later, John F Kennedy’s brother Robert was assassinatedat the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after making a speech in his campaign towin the Democratic presidential domination. I believe that he, Martin LutherKing, Malcolm “X”, Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon were all murderd by the sameforce.The Brotherhood makes and breaks presidents almost at will, and it is the samein other countries, too. According to Bill Cooper and others, President Nixonintended to fight to the end when faced with impeachment over the Watergatescandal. The Brotherhood wanted no such impeachment hearings and told him toresign. When he refused, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a top secret message tothe commanders of US forces all over the world. According to Cooper, who claimsto have seen the message while working for Naval Intelligence, it said: “Uponreceipt of this message, you will no longer carry out any orders from the WhiteHouse. Acknowledge receipt”. It was another five days before Nixon resigned. Whoreplaced him? Thirty-third degree mason, Gerald Ford, who, in 1974, made NelsonRockefeller his Vice-President. (The Thirty-third degree is divided into twoparts – one knows the real agenda, the other does not.)Today, the Brotherhood secret government continues to control the United Statesand continues its preparations for a global coup. A book by Bob Woodward, one ofthe journalists who investigated Watergate, is already suggesting that theeconomic policy of the Democrat, President Clinton, is being directed by AlanGreenspan, the Republican chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who wasappointed by President Reagan and re-appointed by President Bush. Greenspan is aBiderberger, Trilateralist and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.Clinton has also announced increased trading links with China, despite thedisgraceful civil rights record of that country, but then money always speakslouder than principles. Bill Clinton is a Thirty-third degree mason, a member ofthe Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the BilderbergGroup. There is a great deal we need to know about Bill Clinton, not least thequestion of his attitude to CIA drug-running via the Mena airstrip in Arkansas.One thing is for sure, if the Brotherhood had not selected him, with or withouthis knowledge, he would not be President:“Then it was that the era of republics became possible of realisation; and thenit was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government – by apresident taken from the mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures, ourslaves.” (Illuminati Protocol 10).What we also need to know is the extent of the Lucifer cults within Americanmilitary intelligence, the CIA, and other intelligence agencies. One report hasalready come to light about Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Aquino, a senior officerwithin US Military Intelligence. He formed the Temple of Set (the ancientEgyptian name for Lucifer), and when it was made public, the authorities saidthey had no problem with that. If there was a purge on secret, Lucifer-inspired,cults and societies within the secret services of the world, the intelligencenetwork would probably collapse due to lack of personnel! Interestingly, Aquinoserved as a psychological warfare specialist in Vietnam and this has become anincreasingly important weapon for the Illuminati.The secret development of mind control techniques by the intelligence agencieshas also reached an advanced stage. These agencies operate outside of democraticcontrol. Thirty-third degree freemason, Gerald Ford, launched a Commission tolook into the workings of the security services after the Watergate scandal. Whodid he ask to chair it? Nelson Rockefeller! If it wasn’t so tragic, you couldalmost laugh. The CIA and its fellow agencies around the world, including theBritish, have been spending billions on research into mind-controlling andpopulation-controlling techniques. These involve, among other things, drugs,brain washing, brain implants to turn people literally into robots, theinjection of experimental viruses, hypnosis, and the use of electromagneticfields, according to researchers of these subjects. If you think humans havebeen robots up to now, stick around, unless we take action now. Mind controlgoes back to the ancient Brotherhood mystery schools and beyond. The Nazis wereperfecting it before and during the war and so were the American agencies whichbecame the CIA. In the 1950s the CIA was funding mind-controlling projects withcode names like Project Bluebird (Artichoke after 1953) and later ProjectMK-ULTRA. The British and many other agencies were doing the same, asinformation crossed borders on the Brotherhood networks.The CIA and British Intelligence were funding tests into LSD and similar drugsin the 1950s and ’60s and some horrendous experiments have been done in stateprisons and psychiatric institutions, involving children as well as adults.Don’t let them kid you the Nazis had a monopoly on such things. Anything theydid, the ‘good guys’ are also doing in the lands of ‘freedom and justice’. Asthis book was going to press, the US Government admitted that people, includingmentally handicapped children and pregnant women, had been used in the past forexperiments, without their knowledge and consent, into the effects of radiation.The past? Similar things are still happening! So if you are seeking to escapethis mad world through drugs….don’t, don’t, don’t. LSD was not the liberatingdrug it was claimed by so many to be. It was researched and encouraged by theCIA, the British Secret Service and others and, to a large extent, it thwartedthe 1960s revolution and the desire of the baby boomers for mental freedom, bysubverting their values with a lack of direction. The mass prescribing ofanti-depressants and other drugs world-wide is playing its part in advancing thezombie mentality which the Brotherhood want to bring about. Some of thesetechniques have undoubtedly been used to take out people who threatenBrotherhood operations. You can appreciate how it can be done when you see whatone CIA psychiatrist said about the use of hypnosis and the implantation ofminute electrodes in the brain:“The subject who was able to develop good post-hypnotic amnesia will alsorespond to suggestions to remember events which did not actually occur. Onawakening, he will fail to recall the real events of the trance and instead willrecall the suggested events. If anything, this phenomena is easier to producethan total amnesia, perhaps because it eliminates the subjective feeling of anempty space in the memory.”What a great way to programme a ‘lone assassin’. I have no doubt that many ofthe ‘abductions’ claimed to have been by UFO occupants are, in reality,abductions by human servants of Lucifer in the Brotherhood. That is not to saythat people aren’t abducted by ETs, I have an open mind on that, but this isused as a cover for Brotherhood activities of exactly the same kind, too.Suggestions are implanted into the victims’ minds, as described above, so theybelieve they have been taken and implanted by ETs when it has really been doneto them by humans. Under deep hypnosis by those who are investigating thisphenomenon, many of these ‘ET victims’ have recalled being taken away in a van,sometimes marked US Navy. Perhaps the vans are an example of the advancedtechnology that the Americans have given the ETs in exchange for theirs! I’llswap you this inter-galactic, inter-frequency, anti-gravity craft, for a Fordtruck. Yes, sounds reasonable. It’s a deal.Many people who have said they were abducted by UFOs have been found to havebrain implants which can be seen on X-Rays. Apparent UFO victims have oftenrecalled having operations during their ordeal, in which needles are insertedinto the brain. Because this technology is not familiar to ‘normal’ science, itis assumed that it has come from some extra-terrestrial source. But, forwhatever reason, the science of the Brotherhood has put them years ahead of thescience the rest of us know. Brotherhood scientists working on code-namedprojects have developed an electrode which can receive and transmit signals,produce visions and hallucinations, and have complete physical control of aperson’s body. Given that the ETs have always known of these techniques, it putssome of the ‘spiritual revelations’ of St Paul, Moses, Mahomet, and the Mormonfounder, Joseph Smith, into another perspective, maybe? Too incredible tobelieve? Let me quote the words of Dr Jose Delgado, when he was a psychologistat Yale University decades ago:“Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…. it is evenpossible to create and follow intentions, the development of thoughts and visualexperiences. By electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures,movements can be induced by radio command, hostility may appear and disappear,social hierarchy can be modified, sexual behaviour may be changed, and memory,emotions, and the thinking process may be influenced by remote control.”Want a lone assassin? No problem. Want an Israeli to kill a group of Arabs in anattempt to demolish peace talks? No problem. Want some guy to go into a schoolwith a gun and start killing children to manipulate public opinion intodemanding an armed or more authoritarian police force? Want to destroy thecredibility of a group or organisation which threatens you by making one of itsmembers do something terrible or ridiculous? No problem. We at the House of MindControl can cater to your every desire. Why is it that most of the ‘loneassassins’ are made out to be mentally deranged or ‘nutters’? Who, or what,makes them like that? This is how John Lennon was killed. He threatened theBrotherhood with his promotion of peace, love, the eternal nature of the spirit,and his inspiration to the young. He was murdered by a mind-controlled attacker.If you don’t want to make a big public show of it, there is always the drug orpsychically-induced heart attack or brain haemorrhage.Nor is this confined to the United States. An investigation in Sweden revealedthat for the last twenty-five years doctors there have been using patients foron-going mind experimentation. They have been implanting transmitters into thebrains of patients to use them like laboratory animals. The control of whichDelgado speaks was possible in the 1950s and no doubt long before that.Today, the Brotherhood, thanks to its secret scientific research, have theability for mass mind control. They have perfected the use of microwave pulsescarrying instructions which can control individual or collective behaviour. Boththe Americans and the Russians can do this. This knowledge of ‘psychic attack’has been passed on over the centuries through the Brotherhood. An issue of thenewsletter, ‘Tactical Technology’, in 1993 reported the latest developments inRussian technology of this kind. The report was about a visit to Russia inNovember 1991 by Janet Morris, the Research Director of the US Global StrategyCouncil, a think tank in Washington DC, founded by the former CIA DeputyDirector, Ray Cline:“Morris and other members of a team sent to investigate Russian technologies forcommercial development were invited to a demonstration of a mind controltechnology. A volunteer from the US team sat down in front of a computer screenas innocuous words flashed across the screen. The volunteer was only required totell which words he liked and which he disliked. At the end of the demonstrationthe Russian staff started revealing the sensitive, innermost, thoughts of thevolunteer – none of which had been previously discussed…… The Russians toldMorris of a demonstration in which a group of workers were outside the hospitalworking in the grounds. The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correction message viatheir machine to the workers telling them to put down their tools, knock on thedoor of the hospital and ask if there was anything else they could do. Theworkers did exactly that, the Russians said.“The Russians admitted to using this technology for special operations teamselection and performance enhancement and to aid their Olympic athletes and anAntarctic exploration team. Being an infra-sound, very low frequency-typetransmission, the acoustic-correction message is transmitted via boneconduction. This means that earplugs will not restrict the message. An entirebody protection unit system would be required to stop reception. The message,according to the Russians, by-passes the conscious level and is acted upon withexposure times of under one minute. Morris envisions this technology will beminiaturised into a hand-held device. Presently the International HealthlineCorporation is planning to bring a team of specialists to the US in the nearfuture to further demonstrate the capability.”Want the British Cabinet, the House of Commons, the US President or Congress tocome to decisions that suit you? No problem. Want to encourage civil wars andthe most unspeakable behaviour to further justify a world army and government?And what if you want stock markets to react as you wish them to? When you lookat this, it gives new meaning to the phrase: ‘Forgive them, they know not whatthey do.’There is another sinister aspect to this that we must resist with everything wehave. Everything about us is already kept on computer, and now the Brotherhoodwant to go a stage further and have our actions totally under their control.Once again they are trying to do this covertly under the cover of a ‘reasoned’suggestion to help us. How kind they are. We are now hearing of the growth incredit card fraud and how something must be done so people can be identifiedmore easily. What will be suggested is some kind of bar coding on each person –like they use on the goods in the supermarket – and in this way the authoritieswill know where we are, and what we are doing at all times. It would also beused to transmit messages to us like the computers and robots we would then be.They are already leading up to this by doing it with animals, and we are next ifwe allow it to happen. The Marin Humane Society in America explained thetechnique in an article by one of its public relations associates:“For nearly a year, the Marin Humane Society has been implanting every dog andcat adopted from the shelter with a micro-chip ID, a high-tech answer to the ageold problem of permanently identifying your beloved pet. The microchip, aboutthe size of an uncooked grain of rice, is encased in biomedical grade glass. Thechip is imprinted with a ten-digit alpha-numeric code and is implanted by simpleinjection between the animals shoulder blades. With the wave of a hand-heldscanner, the chip is activated to transmit the code to a computer which providesthe owner’s name and address, any relevant medical information and, mostimportantly, the owner’s phone number.”The Brotherhood of the New World Order want to go further than that with humans.They want us bar-coded so we can be ‘read’ at supermarkets and banks, like acheckout assistant now reads a tin of beans. A man at IBM who invented thelaser-bar reader for supermarkets has also developed a method of putting thesame type of device under human skin in one billionth of a second. It isinvisible to the naked eye and could carry all the information anyone needed toknow about us. We could be permanently linked to a computer, and who is to saythat signals could not be sent both ways? Six thousand people in Sweden havealready accepted a mark on their hands as part of an experiment into a cashlesssociety, and trials have also started in Japan.Dr Carl W Sanders, a highly acclaimed electronics engineer, tells in aninterview with Nexus magazine how his microchip project to help people withsevered spinal cords was taken over by a government programme called ProjectPhoenix. Henry Kissinger and CIA officials attended meetings of the project,Sanders says. At one the question was asked “How can you control people if youcan’t identify them?” Interestingly, the chip is re-charged by changes in bodytemperature, and they have established that the best spot for this is on theforehead, just below the hairline. (Remember the ‘mark of the beast’ mentionedin the Book of Revelations?) Sanders attended seventeen meetings with the ‘OneWorld’ brigade about the microchip, including some in Brussels and Luxembourg.The US President has the power under the “Emigration of Control Act (1986),section 100”, to make legal whatever type of identification tagging he deemsnecessary.Microchip implants are being inserted into people during abductions. They nowwant to dupe everyone into accepting it legally. Their ideal is to have everynewborn baby implanted as the normal course of events. This is the so-called‘womb to tomb’ plan. They will use the excuse of medicine (this microchip willre-programme the body to fight disease), of finding missing people (just thinkyour child need never be lost again), and a string of other reasons. Each excusemight sound very reasonable in itself, but look at the hidden agenda. Don’t letit happen!Nor is electromagnetic and high technology limited to mind control. Its use iscausing catastrophic damage to the physical body and the environment, besidesbeing perfected for military use. Our non-physical selves are a series ofinteracting, electromagnetic energy fields, so we are affected at the core ofour being by other electromagnetic fields. And if the etheric level is affected,the physical body malfunctions. For reasons of mind control and to create moreefficient weapons systems, waves of electromagnetic pulses are being generatedacross the world by particularly the United States. The US Omega Network, withstations in Norway, Argentina, Hawaii, Japan, Liberia, La Reunion Island,Australia, and the US are sending out low frequency ground waves as part of anuclear weapons response system. These ground waves are causing ill effects forthose who live in the area and for the Earth’s energy field. The Omega Networkis only part of the mass of electromagnetic frequencies being emitted forreasons of weaponry and control. These are responsible for an enormous number ofcancers, cataracts, genetic defects, and mental illness. Robert Becker MD, anauthor and specialist in electromagnetic pollution, quoted in the excellentNexus Magazine, said this:“All abnormal man-made electromagnetic fields, regardless of their frequencies,produce the same biological effects. These effects, which deviate from normalfunctions and are actually or potentially harmful, are the following:“Effects on growing cells, such as increases in the rate of cancer celldivision; increases in the incidence of certain cancers; developmentalabnormalities in embryos; alterations in neurochemicals, resulting inbehavioural abnormalities such as suicide; alterations in biological cycles;decline in immune-system efficiency; alterations in learning ability.”It is this electromagnetic pollution that is the overwhelming cause of the dyingforests, and while atmospheric pollution is terrible, this is used as a frontfor the main killer. But one Brotherhood technique is to use the threat to theenvironment as a justification for promoting the coordination powers of a worldgovernment.Throughout the decades since 1945, the CIA and other intelligence agencies onthe Brotherhood network have been covertly working to increase conflict andcontrol. The Suez ‘crisis’ in the 1950s was an example of how the Allies evendupe each other. Ex-CIA man Miles Copeland tells in his autobiography of how theBritish Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, became so obsessed with removing Egypt’sPresident Nasser after he had nationalised the Suez Canal, that the US Secretaryof State expected to be asked any day by the British to agree to anassassination plot. This would have been rather difficult for the Americansbecause they were supporting Nasser and hoping he would help to reduce theinfluence of Islam. As Copeland points out:“At this time, the CIA station chief received a message from [CIA Director]Allen Dulles himself, sent at the insistence of his brother, [the Secretary ofState], directing us to examine ways in which, if push came to shove, Nassercould be killed.“There was a negative tone to the message which implied that the Dulles brotherswould welcome a carefully thought out reply to the effect that Nasser wasinvulnerable, but we were not, of course, to mention the fact that we were thereason he was out of reach of would-be assassins since we had ourselves designedthe security arrangements around him.“……And now I must make an even more arresting admission. While the ‘straights’in Washington were increasingly displeased with the anti-American content ofNasser’s public utterances and the anti-American propaganda that poured out ofRadio Cairo, the Middle East’s most far reaching voice, can you guess who waswriting a goodly portion of the material? We were. We understood, as Nasser didat that time, the new regime’s hold on the country depended on its beingconsistently and convincingly anti-American, and that Nasser couldn’t even riskan indication of reasonableness towards our various Middle East policies….. Wetook pains to make it counter-productive, of course, and we included a lot ofpatent nonsense, but we kept virtually in control of its production.”With the above in mind, look again at the anti-American speeches of SaddamHussein at the time of the Gulf War in 1991. There can never have been a moreobviously orchestrated conflict than that. The Americans made it plain to Saddamthat if he went into Kuwait they would not react. He went in and they reacted.On 25th July 1990, Saddam met with the US Ambassador, April Glaspie, after hehad told the Arab nations and the Soviet Union that he intended to invadeKuwait! They did not object. According to cables released in July 1991, Glaspiedeliberately misled Saddam who believed that the US took the same view. She wasacting under instructions from the White House.The then-president Bush seemed content to use sanctions at first, but suddenlyover a short period US forces began to arrive in large numbers. The UnitedNations gave the US ‘permission’ to attack Saddam under their flag and, withsupport from countries like Britain and France, they unleashed their macho menon the Iraqis. The US were keenly supported by Saudi Arabia, the birthplace ofIslam, where the Saudi branch of freemasonry is largely based at the US oilcompany, Aramco. When the American, sorry, UN forces had the Iraqis in disarrayand could have moved on to take Baghdad to remove the dictator they claimed tohate so bitterly, they stopped. Why? Because they didn’t want Saddam removed, hewas too useful where he was – if, indeed, the real Saddam was still alive bythen. I’m not convinced that the man who is now claimed to be Saddam is the sameperson that we saw before he ‘disappeared’ for so long through and after thewar. Cloning is not science fiction!Some channelled information I was given a few days ahead of the Gulf conflictsaid:“… There is no way to appease the situation as only a few know the truth of thereal situation. Here we have a war of economics, money, materialism, but most ofall greed. The monies do not go to the people, but into the coffers of only afew because of corruption and secrecy. As the walls fall on the economic crisisso will dishonesty come to light. It will involve those that you trust as wellas those you do not trust.”The ‘victory’ over Saddam was portrayed as the effectiveness of the UnitedNations, and what a benefit a UN (Brotherhood) army could be. Once again themedia poodle wagged its tail through the Gulf War period. Whenever you read apaper or see a news bulletin, remember above all else that nothing is ever whatit seems to be.The plan for world domination continues apace across the planet today as thesecret armies are trained and prepared with government funding behind fake namesand fake projects. One of these in the United States is called the FederalEmergency Management Agency (FEMA). This has a budget of billions of dollars,and yet it wasn’t even created under constitutional law. It is the result of aPresidential Executive Order. In 1935, the Emergency Management Act was passedto give the President the right to by-pass Congress and make laws in times ofnational emergency. Fair enough, you might think. Sometimes you have to actquickly when there’s an emergency. The little point they don’t tell you is thatthere is always officially a state of national emergency in the United States!This gives the President powers to make laws whenever he wishes, and have themready and waiting for the time when they can all be implemented at once. Youmight like to know that these executive orders passed since 1935 have given thePresident the power to do the following, whenever he decides there is increasedinternational tension or economic crisis:To take over all transport, roads, and ports; all media; the power industries;food production and farms; all aircraft; relocate communities and mobilisepeople into work brigades under government supervision; start a nationalregistration scheme.The list goes on, and when a state of emergency is declared by the President,Congress cannot challenge it for at least six months.“He (the President) will have the right to propose temporary laws, and even newdepartures in the government constitutional working, the pretext both for theone and other being the requirements for the supreme welfare of the State……“We shall invest in the president the right to declare a state of war. We shalljustify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the wholearmy of the country must have it at his disposal for the defence ofthe…..constitution.” (Illuminati Protocol 10).FEMA came into being this way. It was started by….. Zbigniew Brzezinski;remember him? He started the Trilateral Commission with Rockefeller money, andserved as National Security Advisor for the first Trilateralist President, JimmyCarter. Brzezinski stayed on after Carter’s defeat, to continue his work withFEMA under Ronald Reagan. FEMA’s public face is presented as an organisationthat reacts to national emergencies – everything from a nuclear attack to anearthquake or an urban riot. Strange then, you might think, that only sixpercent of its budget is spent on national emergencies. The rest is used toconstruct underground facilities for the government in time of ‘foreign ordomestic’ emergency, and to build ‘holding facilities’, prisons and ‘refugeefacilities’, none of which have ever been used for such purposes. So why arethey building them? FEMA has around 3,600 employees, and yet only sixty work onnatural disasters or prepare plans in case of nuclear attack. What are the restdoing?Two familiar names were in charge of FEMA for a number of years: General RichardSecord and Colonel Oliver North, who worked with the CIA and US Air Force tosmuggle weapons (and what else?) in what became known as the Iran-Contra Affair.FEMA is another major arm of the secret government. One of its aims is to disarmthe American people. Now, I’m all for getting rid of weapons of all kinds, butagain you need to look at the motives behind it. If you are planning a takeover,a coup against what passes for a democratic order, then it is much easier if thepopulation is unarmed. And what do you need to justify laws taking away thepublic’s right to own a gun under American law? More violent, high profilecrime. Exactly what you need to justify the arming of police forces like thoseof Britain, which have not carried arms as a matter of course in the past.Incidentally, the American Gun Control Act of 1968 is word for word the Nazi GunControl Law of 1938.Another branch of the secret government working with FEMA is theMulti-Jurisdictional Task Force (MJTF), which was started by President GeorgeBush. Bill Clinton talks of the need for a national police force when he alreadyhas one. The MJTF is now in almost all American states, and its role ishouse-to-house searches, the seizure and ‘categorising’ of men, women andchildren, and their transfer to detention centres (built by FEMA, remember), andthe interrogation of these people. We are talking about concentration campshere, ladies and gentlemen. Twenty-three such camps were authorised originallyand another twenty were allowed for under the 1990-91 military budget. The MJTFrecruits from urban street gangs, who are now allowed to do legally what theyhave been doing illegally for most of their lives, to enter homes, takepossessions etc. They are too stupid to see that they are being used, and thatthey will be removed too, when their purpose is served.The third element in this triangle is the Financial Crime Enforcement Network(FINCEN). This is made up mostly of people from overseas police forces andmilitary, particularly European. FINCEN in Montana has a number of Gurkhas inits ranks. They have thousands of helicopters and other aircraft at theirdisposal, which are appropriately painted black. Many times, black helicoptershave been seen near the occurrence of cattle mutilations which are said to bethe work of ETs. FINCEN personnel are trained to land, do their dark deeds, andthen disappear into the sky very quickly. The Brotherhood-controlled UnitedNations is supporting and helping to coordinate these operations. All it takesis one major manufactured ‘crisis’, and the starting gun fires. Goodbyedemocracy, or what claims to be democracy. I understand the plans for thetakeover of the United States are now well advanced. Part of this is forMichigan, for instance, to become known as ‘Area 5’, with its capital as Chicagoand its governor appointed by the President without the complications of anelection. One possible ‘emergency’ to set off this chain of events could be thatof a terrorist with a nuclear weapon, threatening to destroy the United States.Watch for such a deceit, because something like this will be used to justify thecoup in its first stages, if it gets that far.These covert preparations for the New World Order are not confined to the UnitedStates. They are happening in all the major countries, with most of thepoliticians having no idea of what is going on behind their backs, or what themoney they are allocating is really being spent on. In Britain the laws aregetting more sinister every year. The Department of Transport pays securityfirms and private investigators to identify those who protest peacefully againstroad projects that destroy the environment, and it sends innocent people toprison for the crime of trying to stop this madness of taking the human race outof existence. We must challenge this by protesting in even greater numbers. Theycan’t arrest us all!It is difficult to know exactly what is going on today, because wheneverinformation is released into the public domain you can be sure that it hasalready been superseded. Don’t forget that some of it could have been planted todeceive in the first place. I certainly do not claim that every detail in thisbook is correct. I have taken the findings of many researchers and tried toweave a story from this wealth of combined information, using my intuition andthe common threads as my guide. I would not stake my life on every detail, but Iwould on the themes. Throughout the process of my spiritual awakening I havebeen left in no doubt when I am being guided to an area of knowledge that needsto be made public. Suddenly information on a specific subject comes in from alldirections, and never more so than with the New World Order. I had only vaguelyheard of the term until, over a period of three weeks, all the information aboutit in this book was put into my hands by a variety of different people. Those onthe higher levels who are guiding me wanted this information put in the book,and made available to the public.It really doesn’t matter whether you believe ETs are involved or not. Theoutcome is the same – a covert attempt to take over the world by duping the massof the population and ‘removing’ those who refuse to play ball. That’s thesimple fact we all need to keep focused on. The Brotherhood will not succeedultimately, because the transformation of consciousness now unfolding issweeping their plans away. They may use a lot of twisted Egyptian mytholgy tojustify their ambitions, but they should remember that in those stories Horus,the son, defeats Set in the final battle. So it will be. But what the Lucifer –(Set) – controlled Brotherhood can do is make the transition far more difficult,painful and traumatic, and hold back the spiritual awakening of millions ofpeople.They are using the increasing violence and conflict, the collapsing globaleconomy and the threat to the environment – all of which they are, to a largeextent, causing – to hoodwink the people into the nightmare of a worldgovernment, world central bank, world currency, world army, and global control.Perhaps waiting in the wings is the claim that the planet is in imminent dangerof an alien invasion. This could well be the card they are preparing to play tocoerce a terrified population into willingly handing over all the centralisedpower the Brotherhood desire. I have noticed that suddenly the media is full ofhighly negative ‘alien abduction’ stories and such like, and information isbeing released into the public arena about ‘aliens’ on perhaps a bigger scalethan ever before. This makes me even more wary about some of the more extremeclaims about extra-terrestrial activities. Is public opinion being prepared forthe ‘aliens are coming’? Who knows the truth? All I can say is that if you hearthat the ‘aliens are invading’ and the authorities start taking emergencypowers, please, please, be very careful before you believe it.Remember the Illuminati want you to accept central world control of thegovernments, banks, currency and army. Anything that seeks to justify that isthe Illuminati at work.The Illuminati want to manipulate you into giving them authoritarian powers, andonce that has occured an extreme, and I can’t stress enough the word extreme,fascist government will be imposed across the world.“When we at last definitely come into our kingdom by the aid of coups d’etatprepared every where for one and the same day, after the worthlessness of allexisting government has been definitely acknowledged…we shall…slay without mercyall who take arms to oppose the coming of our kingdom. Every kind of newinstitution of anything like a secret society will also be punished with death.”(Illuminati Protocol 15).“We shall create an intensified centralisation of government in order to grip inour hands all the forces of the community. [New laws]…will withdraw one by oneall the indulgences and liberties which have been permitted by the Goyim and ourkingdom will be distinguished by a despostism of such magnificent proportions asto be at any moment and in every place in a position to wipe out any Goyim whooppose us by deed or word.” (Protocol 5).“The Goyim are a flock of sheep, and we are the wolves. And you know whathappens when the wolves get hold of the flock? There is another reason also whythey will close their eyes: for we shall keep promising them to give back allthe liberties we have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peaceand tamed all parties…It is not worth while to say anything about how long atime they shall be kept waiting for this return of their liberties.” (Protocol11).We have a big decision to make. I have made mine and so have increasing numbersof others. Are you going to make a stand here and dedicate the rest of your lifeto stopping this takeover and speed the emergence of love and freedom on thisplanet? Or are you going to shrug your shoulders, open another beer, change theTV channel, and allow yourself to be another official, computerised, microchipimplanted robot? Sit on your backside or look the other way, and you will bevoting for that. You will be condemning your children and their children to thisnightmare too. In the second part of the book I am going to look at some of thethings we can do, but words are not enough unless supported by action.If anyone has any more information – facts not speculation – about what is goingon I would very much like to hear it. You will understand, I am sure, if I aminitially wary of such information, but I would be grateful to receive it allthe same. I would also make it clear that after this book is published, I haveno intention of committing suicide, disappearing, being found in a compromisingsituation, drug-running, breaking the law (except openly!), or anything elsethat would affect my ability to tell people what is happening, in every way Ican. In fact I will be going out of my way to avoid all of them. I am also invery good health, thank you very much, never been better.Should anything like this happen to me, you will know why and you will know who.* Others attending included Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands, Queen Sophia ofSpain, the owner of the Washington Post, Andrew Knight the then chairman ofRupert Murdoch’s News International, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, anda stream of prime ministers, politicians, bankers and industrialists.* Quoted by Dana Baker in her article on “Media Suppression” in ProfileMagazine."},{"pageContent":"13When Will We Ever Learn?THIS first half of the book is not a detailed history of the world, nor is itmeant to be. I have merely sought to pick out certain key themes which, I feel,will help us to end the violence, destruction, and the control behind it.Most people who have been incarnate on the planet over these thousands of yearswere not, as individuals, all murdering, persecuting bigots. I am the first tosay that, and I stress it again now. Most lived their lives in the best way theycould within the confines of this dense physical form and the limitations of theworld around them. Most do not come into incarnation to cause suffering, that isnot their intention. They want to serve the planet, not destroy her. But once weincarnate we can become like dodgem cars in a fairground, hooked up to the samethought patterns and, to varying degrees, with the Luciferic consciousness atthe wheel.I remember my friend Yeva having a psychic vision once when I was with her thatgave some idea of what it must be like waiting to incarnate. She saw millions ofpeople being told about what was happening here and how best to remember whothey were after incarnation. The overwhelming feeling she had during this visionwas the frustration of these beings. They knew what needed to be done on theEarth, but they also knew that after incarnation the pressures were such thatthey were likely to act in the same destructive ways as those currently in densephysical bodies.Before we become consumed by guilt over all that has happened through humanhistory, we should remember that this is a tough place to be at the moment, andhas been for a long time. When I highlight the destructive behaviour of humansover these thousands of years I am not judging or condemning individuals. I amchallenging the thought patterns, imbalances, and downright mind control thathave motivated that behaviour. The Augustines, Jeromes, Hitlers, and sundrypopes, are victims also. It is their thought patterns I challenge and seek toexpose, not them as eternal beings. I have given this negative force a symbolicname, Lucifer, for simplicity, but really it is an extreme imbalance which wecan all be subject to if we let our values drop. This is not, however,humanity’s natural state. I say again: We are intrinsically good, not evil. Itis the unique density of this planet and the severe negative influences that arebehind our actions, and the only way we can change that is to think forourselves and synchronise with our higher levels. Accepting that those levelsexist is the first and most important step we can take.One thing is very clear from the patterns addressed by the book so far. Wheneverwe have had the free flow of all information into the public arena and everyonehas respected another’s right to interpret that information in ways that feelright to them, human evolution has surged ahead. Whenever the free flow ofinformation has been stemmed and doctored and one belief system imposed, humanevolution has stopped or declined. We need to keep this at the forefront of ourthinking as we search for ways to build a fair and balanced world in the yearsto come.To some people it may appear that I see a conspiracy behind every corner, but Idon’t. I am a great believer in the ‘cock-up factor’ of history, too, and notevery event is the Brotherhood at work. But I have been trying to chart a paththrough the last twenty thousand years or so, to pick out common links andconnections. This has led me, and growing numbers of others around the world, tobelieve that there is indeed a central conspiracy of manipulation which threadsits way through human history. When I look at all the coincidences that happenedin a few weeks to present me with information about this conspiracy before thebook was completed, it is clear that other levels of consciousness want peopleto know that there is some serious string-pulling going on, and it is time thatthe puppeteers were exposed. They can’t control events if we will not cooperate.We have the power, not they, if only we could recognise it.What I hope I have succeeded in doing in the first half of the book is tohighlight the following:(1) That over thousands of years a Brotherhood of secret societies has emergedwhich has been used to manipulate humanity in the most fundamental and horrificways, and that its goal of world dictatorship is planned to be imposed in ourlifetimes.(2) That extra-terrestrials have probably had a fundamental impact on humanevolution.(3) That far from civilising the world, Christianity and other dogmatic, imposedreligions have held back our evolution for at least two thousand years.(4) That the free flow of all information and knowledge is the path to freedomand understanding, a fact confirmed by the constant examples of Church andpolitical dictatorships destroying alternative views to their dogma and control.(5) That the ills of the world have been overwhelmingly caused by the greatmajority allowing themselves to be blindly led by the few.(6) That the belief that anyone has a monopoly on truth and wisdom is probablythe most destructive and stupid belief it is possible to have.(7) That to believe our dense physical bodies are superior to another race orculture is, along with religion and greed, the cause of almost every war andconflict experienced by humankind.(8) That the virtue of forgiveness really is the only way we are going to breakthe cycles of vengeance and revenge.I’d like to expand on those last three points. Our belief that the physical bodyis ‘us’ in total has to change if we are to be set free from these cycles. It isthis belief that leads people to seek revenge in this life for what was done tothe ancestral line of their bodies hundreds and even thousands of years ago,when the body is merely the vehicle for their consciousness to experience thisdense physical world. It is like two people in different spacesuits on the Moonhaving a fight because of what two other spacemen did to each other whilewearing the same kind of spacesuits years before. We would say that was crazyand yet look at Northern Ireland, the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and soon and that, in effect, is what they are doing. Only by recognising this can itbe stopped. This is one reason why the Illuminati have worked so hard to keepthe spiritual truths from the mass of the people, and it is vital that thissuppressed knowledge as set out in this book be widely known. Even then thisunderstanding has to be wider and more mature than belief systems like Hinduismwhich uses karma and reincarnation to justify some horrific behaviour. Also,giving responsibility for our actions to someone else is like handing over alethal weapon. Once we look to others to lead us and tell us what to do andthink we are building the foundations of all the violence, pain, and suffering Ihave documented.The great majority of those who persecuted non-believers or different believersactually thought they were carrying out the wishes of God. They had allowedthemselves to be so mind-controlled that whatever they were told was God’scommand they followed to the letter. No-one would have persuaded them they weredoing anything wrong. They were people of their time, controlled by the beliefsystem programmed into them. Today it’s still the same with billions of peoplemind controlled to think the way the Brotherhood demands and they ridicule,condemn, and even murder those who challenge its nonsenses and control. What isthe difference, except in background and scale, between that and the horrors ofreligious and political persecution in the past? Both are the result of the samenon-thinking, the same robotic responses, and the desire to pass responsibilityto think and act to others. What makes it most effective for the forces ofdestruction is that people who don’t think are persuaded that they do. Nothingis more closed than a closed mind that thinks it’s open and nothing is moremanipulated than a manipulated mind that thinks it’s free. It is the ultimateillusion, and yet I meet people like that every day.We have lurched from extreme to extreme over most of the last twelve thousandyears and more because we have not, collectively, had the humility to appreciatethat we do not know it all, or even nearly so. There is no way we will balanceall knowledge and understanding while one group thinks it has all the answersand the others think the same. We had the Roman Catholic Church that persecutednon-believers because it believed itself to have the truth; then came theProtestants who persecuted Roman Catholics for the same reason; then theProtestants broke up into factions caused by the minutest of difference betweenthem, and they persecuted each other because each believed they had the truth;then came materialistic science which proceeded to marginalise and condemn thosein its own profession who challenged the this-world-is-all-there-is dogma. Eachfaction and dogma decides it has the truth, builds an empire of income andinfluence, and defends that against all comers, especially if they bring newknowledge to question the status quo. This mentality sees the preservation ofprivilege through the status quo as far more important than the advancement ofhuman understanding. Whoever has their hands on the wheel seeks to keep everyoneelse out of the vehicle.The ‘baa baa’ mentality in which the masses do as the few, even sometimes theone, tells them is at the heart of the control of the human consciousness.Divide and rule is the great truism. Under this policy, you need to createdivision. If you have a far right you need to create a far left to oppose it.Division needs two extremes. Many people are being manipulated on the ‘radical’wings of politics, while thinking they have sussed the system. How can it bethat one or a small group of people have controlled millions in the countriesand empires throughout human existence? What was that Gandhi said? ‘100,000Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indians if those Indians will notco-operate.’ Instead whole civilisations have gone ‘baa baa’ and followed theleader of the flock. Or they have allowed themselves to be offered privileges bythe dictator, be it a man, woman, or system, and ignored the injustices theirfellow humans suffer. That is plainly true of the world today. But I rememberwhat Pastor Niemoeller, a victim of the Nazis, said:“First they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not aCommunist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak outbecause I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no-oneleft to speak out for me.”If we ignore injustice against others we are just as responsible as those whodirectly cause that injustice. Again as Gandhi said: ‘Silence is connivance’. Itis time to let the divisions fall away and stand up for each other. They mightbe able to imprison, kill, or discredit a few who say enough is enough, but theycan’t do it to millions standing side by side together. Power is only theability to persuade one group of people that you have power over them. Power isan illusion and is shown to be so when all people stand together and peacefullysay no, this is not right and not acceptable.Running through all these themes across the centuries of human existence is theneed for revenge. If anything this is the most destructive of all emotions. Weall feel it instinctively when we feel someone has treated us unfairly. That isunderstandable within the pressures of this planet. Many times in my life whenpeople have acted negatively towards me, I have had a wish to pay them back.Sometimes that feeling still flows through me when something happens that I feelparticularly strongly about. But we need to take a breath and think before wereact instinctively looking for revenge. If you do that and look at the widerconsequences this destructive desire for revenge can be dispersed. It doesn’tmean you don’t still feel hurt, but the need to punish those you believeresponsible is released.This is so important, I cannot stress it enough. As Chief Seattle said:“When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong and disfiguretheir faces with black paint, their hearts, also, are disfigured and turn black.Then their cruelty is relentless and knows no bounds. Our old men are not ableto restrain them. True it is that revenge is considered gain, even at the costof their own lives, but old men who stay at home in times of war, and old womenwho have sons to lose, know better.”What we have seen so far in the book are cycles of vengeance and revenge. Thecycle of one persecuting the other and the need for righting that wrong byfurther, often greater, persecution in return. Mostly it is the innocent whosuffer not the persecutors. Not every Puritan wanted to persecute those ofanother faith, nor every Roman Catholic, or Anglican. But they were still thevictims of the other side when they came back for revenge. Unless we forgive ourenemies, including the Illuminati, we cannot possibly break these cycles ofhuman and planetary pain and destruction because the lust for revenge will goon. Forgiveness may appear to be an old and familiar theme, but wisdom is notnew. It is as old as Creation itself. Forgiveness has, and always will be, thekey to human progress. I would not claim for one second that it is easy in thecircumstances in which we find ourselves, but it remains the only way. If we areto build the new world, a task we will discuss in Part Two, we will only stepout of the cycles of darkness if we forgive each other, reject mind control, andrefuse to be sheep led by human, extra-terrestrial or misguided non-physicalshepherds.It is time to open our eyes and our hearts and take responsibility for ourthoughts and actions. It is time to wake up and grow up. If we do that, anastonishing future awaits us, and it is to that vision we will now turn."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOTHE LIGHT"},{"pageContent":"14Goodbye to All ThatDURING the ‘baby boom’ years after the last World War there was a massincarnation of the volunteer souls.Some volunteers had come earlier and others have arrived in the forty-odd yearssince then. The ‘volunteer’ babies born in those immediate post war years were,however, the biggest influx of those who had chosen to be at the cutting edge ofchange and transformation. To quote a channelled message from Truth Vibrations:“Those of you who are at the forefront of this, you are rather like asnowplough. You are the thin end of the wedge. You really have, how shall I putthis? To a certain extent, I suppose, you have the shitty end of the job. Youhave got to do an awful lot, but nevertheless you are capable of doing an awfullot. That is why you have chosen to come, that is what you are here for, toreally shovel some shit, and therefore make some space behind you to make iteasierfor the others.”I should point out that when thought forms from higher levels are decoded by thelower self and the brain they are often spoken and written in the channeller’sown style. While some would say you have come to remove the negative domination,others would say you have come to shovel some shit. Either way, the volunteerswho have incarnated to be alive at this time – not only the post-war babies byany means – are here to play their part in changing human consciousness byreturning it to its natural state of love, peace, compassion, and wisdom. Thevolunteers’ task is to help the planet so she can heal herself, to remove thebrotherhood domination, and to leave the babies and young children of today witha clear run to create a new world without the Luciferic influence to troublethem. The volunteers are being supported by a vast network of highly evolvedentities on other frequencies and by extra-terrestrials who wish to free theplanet from those who have other, less laudable, ambitions for the human race.It is sorting out time. The volunteers are being guided to complete three maintasks:(1) To raise human consciousness by passing on information that opens the mindand helps people to remember what they already know deep down about the natureof life, Creation, and the current transformation. This helps them tore-synchronise with their higher selves and access more of their eternalknowledge.(2) To repair the energy grid and prepare the Atlantean system for the time tocome soon, when it replaces the temporary system that has been in operation overthe thousands of years since then. This involves the re-activation of theharmonic keys which will unlock those incredibly powerful energies which wereturned down, or off, at the end of Atlantis, as symbolised in the King Arthurlegends.(3) To channel energies into the Earth that will balance out the severe negativedomination in her energy field caused by all the negativity generated by thepain, conflict, and violence documented in this book.In this chapter I will look at some of the ways this is being done, how everyonecan help, and the sort of effects we can expect in our everyday lives. Energiesare being channelled into the grid by volunteers who are collectively known asLight Workers. Anyone can do this as I explain in my book, Heal the World. It isnot an exclusive club for the chosen ones. There are no ‘chosen’ ones, onlypeople. Energy passes through their energy fields and physical bodies and istransformed into a frequency the Earth can absorb. On these occasions the humanbody becomes like an acupuncture needle for the planet, channelling andbalancing energy flows. Since my conscious awakening in 1990, I have been allover the United Kingdom and to many parts of the world doing this, places likePeru, Bolivia, Equador, Chile, Colombia, the United States, Italy, Egypt,Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, and France. I have had someamazing experiences along the way as I recount in my autobiography, In The LightOf Experience. Tens of thousands are knowingly doing this work and millions,unknowingly.These energies which are coming in to raise the frequency of the Earth’s energyfield are, to a large extent, the photon beam I mentioned in the early part ofthe book. The orbit of the Solar System is taking us back across the photonbeam, the rebalancing beam of highly charged particles which offers the chancefor those who are ready to raise themselves to a higher frequency. The EarthSpirit, the energy field of the planet, is due to do just that. The period ofthe opportunity for the Luciferic consciousness is coming to an end and it willhave to wait until another opportunity is offered either by humanity or anotherconsciousness stream. It is reckoned to take two thousand years for the Earth tocross the beam and so all this won’t happen tomorrow, but major changes are uponus. Entering the beam is like crossing the light cast by a lighthouse or torchbeam. You enter in the more diffused, weaker, light first and then you go on topass across the centre where the light is most powerful. I believe that sometimein the last century the Earth began to move into the diffused ‘light’ of thephoton beam and by the 1960s it was having an obvious effect on those who wereopen to it. You don’t have to open yourself to it and the changes it is creatingin the energy field of the planet. There is no compulsion, but there areconsequences.Many people, especially the young, tuned to these energies in the 1960s and itmanifested as the period known as ‘Flower Power’. Energy is consciousness andthe energies carried the information and knowledge which inspired the valuesbehind the sixties phenomenon. If you listen to much of the flower power musicand the protest songs of that time, you will hear the themes of vibrations –good, bad, and changing vibrations – of love for all, and of the times they area changing. All three reflect a knowledge of what is happening in this time ofthe Great Awakening of humankind. Through the 1970s and the ’80s as theBrotherhood pulled in the other direction and sought to destroy such thinking,we still saw the rise of environmental awareness, the growth in animal welfaremovements, of vegetarianism, and explosions of human compassion like Live Aid.Now, in the 1990s as we move further on into the beam, wake up time is upon usas the rebalancing of the Earth’s energy field helps us to re-connect withhigher levels of ourselves and so become ‘whole’.I meet people all the time who have suddenly awakened and begun to see the worldin a new light. They cannot understand why they could not see before what is nowobvious to them. But the reason is simple. Earlier in their lives they wereworking mostly through the conscious level only, that part of us which issubject to the severe limitations of the dense physical body. This can, andmostly is, programmed by the messages it constantly receives through the eyesand the ears in this Lucifer-controlled world and we can believe some ridiculousthings. When we reconnect with all levels, our perceptions reflect the guidanceof our higher wisdom and understanding and we see what a daft world we live in.When this re-connection happens it can be like a dam bursting as knowledge andinformation floods into the conscious level and it can be a traumatic time asyou try to make sense of what is happening to you and your life. I have writtenabout this in Heal The World.The higher we can all raise our own vibratory state by thinking, searching, andseeking truth, wisdom, love and understanding, the higher the vibrations thatcan be passed through us into the Earth and the quicker we remove the Lucifericdomination. A channelled communication in Truth Vibrations explained somethingof this. Speaking of the energies switched off in the latter days of Atlantis,it said:“As the energies around your planet quicken, so these latent energies which havebeen withdrawn will be phased back in. They will gradually be awakened. As theconsciousness of your planet raises itself, those of you Light Workers who areworking together to raise your consciousness, you will be able to hold more andmore refined vibrations, and so we will be able to use you as a catalyst to beable to feed in more and more energies. As more of you raise your consciousness,so we can awaken more of these energies.”The books on the subject, the talks, the media interviews, the discussions withfriends, and the energy channelling are all helping to awaken people and raisethe frequency of the energy field. Most of the awakening is being triggered byenergy changes on the non-physical levels, and even when I speak I can feelenergy pouring through me to the audience and vice versa. That is where the mostimportant interchange is going on. But words, written and spoken, are also anenergy and they can be extremely powerful in getting information to theconscious level to challenge the programming. With every person who changes hisor her thinking, we are another step nearer to that point when the power of suchunderstanding is strong enough in the collective mind of humanity for that tobecome available to everyone, as in the hundredth monkey syndrome. It is in thecollective mind that Lucifer is being challenged most powerfully. I believe weare getting close to that ‘critical mass’ when the collective mind begins to bea source of positive rather than negative influence upon we ‘individuals’ whoare connected to it. When that happens we will see people change with a speedthat will beggar belief.But I am not suggesting this time of change will be easy for anyone. Those whohave come here to be at the sharp end of this transformation have often been‘tested’ to the very limits of their endurance, especially on the emotionallevel. This has been designed to unleash all their inner emotional and mentalstrength and courage. Now is the time when all that has been experienced inprevious physical lifetimes will have to be called upon because the Lucifericconsciousness and its expressions through the economic, political, military andindustrial establishment is not going to go quietly. But have no fear that it isgoing to go. It is already on the way. People who are awakening are findingthemselves at odds with the society in which they live, and even within theirfamilies, too. As they expand their consciousness, they are accessing higherlevels of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. Those with the courage tooutwardly express how they feel are challenging conventional thinking andbehaviour of almost every kind. They are called anything from ‘loony’ to‘dangerous’ by those still mesmerised by the physical world. The Lucifericconsciousness works hard to undermine them, just as it did two thousand yearsago and on so many other occasions through history. But it will not succeed.What will happen – is happening – is that the numbers opening up to thesechanges will go on increasing until they are the majority. Those who resist willeventually go out of incarnation and continue their evolution on a levelsuitable to their current state of being. They won’t cease to exist because weall live forever, but they will no longer be able to live on this planet as herfrequency moves well beyond theirs. Around the planet is a frequency range. Asthis rises, some of the lower frequencies fall out of the range. You could thinkof it as like climbing a ladder. With each higher rung that your hands reach,your feet are leaving others behind. The consciousness still tuned to thoselower ‘rungs’ as the Earth moves on will be affected in many ways. Theirvibratory rate will be falling out of synchronisation with the planet’s energyfield in which they live. This will affect their behaviour, their mental andemotional stability, and their physical health.These will consist of the Brotherhood and the people still clinging on to theold order. This will create tensions between those wishing to bring change andfreedom of lifestyle and expression, and those who want to resist the inevitableby trying to force people to conform to old structures. For those with closedminds who cling on to the status quo the time will come when the vibratory gapbetween them and the planet will be so wide they will go out of incarnation. Theeffects on their behaviour will add to the negative aspects of this transitionperiod and it is up to everyone to help them with love and understanding. Iwould stress, though, that not everyone who leaves their physical shell in theyears ahead will be suffering from the effects of vibratory change. Many will bemoving on at the moment they always planned, their experience in thisincarnation completed. But those who are going with the changes and those whoare not will become clearer with every month from now on. In Heal The World, Ihave suggested ways in which we can increase the speed of this tuning in processby healing ourselves and the planet. For, have no doubt, healing ourselves,loving and forgiving ourselves, is the only way we will heal the Earth and allowthe Earth to heal us. Healing ourselves spiritually and emotionally changes thenature of the energies we generate into the world. Love is the most powerful ofall energy. Love is the answer.The vibratory changes, hastened at certain times by particular astrologicalalignments, will affect the whole world. Nothing and no-one will be the sameagain. Everything is the same consciousness in different states of being. So ifthat consciousness is changing in our part of Creation it must affect everything– the way we think; our emotions; our bodies; the physical Earth; the weather;and, for those who choose to resist these changes to the end, even their abilityto stay in incarnation. A channelled message in 1990 spoke of the implicationsfor relationships and attitudes. These themes are clear in the letters I receiveand the people I meet:“I feel now you are sensing the energies coming in, the energies surroundingyour planet. This is causing many of you to ask questions. It is causing many ofyou to re-evaluate completely your way of life, where you feel you wish to go,what you want to do. It is causing tremendous upheavals. Some of these are veryconfusing, very distressing, very disturbing. Some people in relationships arefinding they can no longer continue in those relationships because theirpartners cannot tune in to what they have been tuning into. It is causing agreat deal of disturbance. And I have said to this sensitive (channeller) onmore than one occasion that you must organise yourselves into groups to supporteach other.”Even some long standing relationships are ending as one partner chooses to takethe spiritual path and the other does not. People who have always had so much incommon are suddenly like strangers to each other. They are literally ondifferent wavelengths. Once one partner begins to react to the changes and gowith them, the urgings of their inner self will be far more powerful than theirdesire to protect a relationship, much as they may love their partner. Some willleave for long periods to follow their path, others will part for good. But whenboth partners choose to follow the frequencies, their relationship will growstronger and evolve to a new level and understanding of love. I see the natureof relationships and family situations changing anyway. There will be no ‘norms’and people will choose to live and love in many ways that will be consideredshocking and outrageous today. They are nothing of the kind. Love is love islove. We will see the return of the extended family and less emphasis on the twoparents and two children model of today.In other books I have likened what is happening to the Earth’s energy field to abowl of water. If you wish to raise the level of the water from the bottom ofthe bowl to the top you have to turn on the tap. As you do this, the calmness inthe water is disturbed and the more you turn on the tap, the more confusion,chaos, and turmoil is unleashed in the bowl. When you reach the top of the bowland turn off the tap, the calmness quickly returns, but at a much higher levelthan before. If you see the water in this example as the Earth’s energy fieldand the tap as the energies coming in, you can see the potential for extremeeffects. In Truth Vibrations, written in 1990, I passed on channelledpredictions of the following themes in this decade and the next one:⋆ Growing and often staggering extremes of weather and other natural disasters,including massive fires.⋆ Gathering conflict all over the world to the point where the United Nationswould be overwhelmed.⋆ The collapse of the world economic system.⋆ The rise of the political right.⋆ The break up of the Soviet Union and other large countries and empires.⋆ The end of the British monarchy, traditional politics and institutions ofstate, and conventional economic and scientific thinking.⋆ The collapse of the religious empires like the Roman Catholic Church and therise of the religious right as a last desperate attempt to keep them going.⋆ Record-breaking earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, and general geologicalactivity.⋆ Time appearing to pass quicker every year. This is the effect of thequickening vibrations and the speeding up of ‘Cosmic time’. You can’t see thisin the hands of the clock moving quicker, but you can feel it and there seems tobe less time to do everything.These effects will have a dual cause. The Brotherhood network will be trying tocause as much disruption as possible to stop the transformation, and hold backthe Earth’s energy field so it cannot make its evolutionary leap and leave thembehind. I feel they will be using their knowledge and technology to try toweaken the grid and stop the rise in frequency. They even have the technology toaffect the weather, particular in smaller areas. The changes within the Earth’senergy field will also create many of these effects, but there is something wecan do about that. The situation is this, quite simply. The further the energyfield is from balance the more disruption will be caused by the re-balancingeffects of the photon beam. So the more we, humanity, can help to create thatbalance the less traumatic this period will be in all things. The further youpush down a pair of scales on one side, the more dramatic is the ‘kick back’when they thrash around seeking balance. The principle is the same with theEarth’s energy field. The more we can generate the energy called love from ourheart chakra for the Earth, people, and all forms of life, the more we will helpthe planet to balance out the negative. This will make less extreme the processof passing through the balancing beam. We all have the potential to do that, itonly takes the will and a change of perception. You can make that change now ifyou wish. Love yourself, love your enemies, love the world.We are not alone. Other extra-terrestrial consciousness streams are working tohelp. But they will not impose themselves on our right to free will as theIlluminati do. We have to ask for their help. More than anything we need to helpourselves.We certainly need all the support and love we can get because the Lucifericconsciousness knows what is happening and the nature of the consciousness shiftthat is underway. It has long known about it and long prepared for it. The nextfew years are going to be quite an experience. Open your hearts and fasten yourseat beats."},{"pageContent":"15The Economics of EnoughSPIRITUAL enlightenment is wonderful, but without a practical expression it canbe overwhelmed by the forces of control. We not only have to think love, andthink change, we have to live it, too.For instance, if we don’t challenge practically the ambitions of theBrotherhood, we are allowing the spiritual revolution, the Robots’ Rebellion, tobe blocked. It is harder to rebel and think for yourself when you have amicrochip inside you transmitting the Brotherhood’s message than when you arefree from such interference. And those under such manipulation are hardly goingto generate the love and understanding we urgently need. In the rest of the bookI am going to outline some of the ways we can speed the spiritual revolution,and stop the Brotherhood from stopping us. I will start with the economic systemwhich the elite currently controls.Even with six billion people sharing this planet, it is still possible toprovide for everyone’s need. What it is not possible to do, as Gandhi said, isto provide for everyone’s greed. The economic system which meets the wants ofthe few by denying the needs of the majority is in its twilight years. It isunsustainable environmentally, and even in its own primitive economic terms ithas reached the end of the road. Don’t be kidded by those computer screens inthe financial centres and the economists with their jargon and System-speak.They are programmed minds who mostly parrot the System’s line because they can’traise their vision to see beyond it. This makes them easy fodder for theIlluminati elite to persuade or bribe them to support ever greatercentralisation. The present system isn’t working and so on the basis of‘something must be done’ they promote more central control, like a World CentralBank. That changes nothing. It’s the same lunacy controlled by fewer people.The first thing we need to do is remove economic growth from our assessment ofhuman and economic success. Gross Domestic Product is the figure that mesmerisesand controls the policies of governments throughout the world. But GDP ismeaningless. All it measures is the amount of money that changes hands for goodsand services in any year, THAT IS IT. Economic growth is not a measurement ofeconomic success, it is merely a measurement of economic activity. It is likemeasuring the success of a soccer team by the amount of running it does in amatch rather than the number of goals it scores. Every time there is anenvironmental disaster caused by the pursuit of economic growth, the money spenton reacting to that disaster is added to economic growth because it is adding toeconomic activity; every time someone is ill and needs treatment it adds to GDP;the same when there is a war. The system of self-destruction takes the moneymade from growth and the money made from the consequences of growth, and insteadof taking one from the other, it adds the two together. Staggering? Of course itis, but that is the system that controls your life and is dismantling theplanet.Any system which uses the growth figure as its only measurement of national,human, and economic success must create a barely-one-dimensional world whichreflects the nature of its economics. But then that is what the Brotherhoodbankers want it to be. Any sane society, which ours is about to become, musthave measurements of human progress that reflect the multidimensional beingsthat we are, such as:> How few are in poverty?> How few are homeless?> How few are hungry?> How few are lonely?> How few are unhappy, dissatisfied, and unfulfilled?> How few feel they are denied the opportunity to realise their full potential?> How few feel their lives are controlled by others?These are some of the true indicators of human progress, and yet they are thevery areas ignored by the present system, because those who control it wish toimprison the people, not set them free. For their system to survive it has toincrease, not decrease, everything on that list. What is good for people is adisaster for the System. You will notice, too, that the measurements I havelisted refer to ‘how few?’. Today’s system measures success only in ‘how many?’Increasing ‘throughput’ is all it can think of. The more units of activity itcan produce, the more successful it claims to be. Question government ministersabout health care provision and they will reply in justification of theirpolicies: ‘We are treating more people than ever before’. But why? Why do somany need treatment? Surely success in health care should be measured by how fewrequire treatment and how many people are healthy, not by how many are ill.The System sees rising house prices as a sign of economic success whilethousands live in the street because they can’t afford a home. Surely successshould be judged on how few people are homeless, not by how much more it costsevery year to buy a house.The whole throughput mentality is so ridiculous that you have transportministers welcoming increased car sales (throughput), while at the same timecomplaining that they can’t afford to build all the new roads necessary to copewith the extra traffic, (a consequence of throughput).The acceleration of human and industrial throughput will not solve the problemsof the world. It is creating most of them. America has consumed more fossilfuels and minerals in the last fifty years than the rest of humanity combined inthe whole of human history. If growth is the way to eliminate poverty,homelessness, hunger, and all the other human ills why hasn’t America managed todo it, despite consuming the planet on that suicidal scale? And what wouldhappen to the Earth if every country sought to do the same? But that is exactlywhat they are being urged to do. Brotherhood-manipulated politicians andeconomists have even invented the impossible in their desperation to justifythis and hide the realities. They now talk of ‘sustainable growth’ when there isno such thing. No growth is sustainable, because we live on a planet of finitesize with a finite ability to take the punishment. Yet the journalists andinterviewers never question them on this obvious contradiction.Greens are ridiculed for their policy of a no-growth economy. But what could bemore sensible and efficient? That policy says there should be no growth and asignificant annual decline in the rate at which we use natural ‘resources’. Thisreduces destructive throughput by getting more from less; by making things tolast as long as technological knowledge will allow; by recycling waste back intothe production process so reducing the need to take more from the planet; byinsulating buildings to reduce the fuel required to keep them warm; and byencouraging local production for local consumption to reduce the need for somuch transportation, trucks, motorways, etc. The list of ways by which we canget more from less through commonsense is endless. This would lead to asustainable, steady state, economy in which no more is taken from the Earth thanshe can replenish and no more is thrown back at the Earth than she can safelyabsorb. In the future we will not need to take from the Earth at all for ourfuels because there is no need to once you understand the nature of energy andhow to harness it for warmth and power.The theory which seeks to justify growth as the way to remove suffering iscalled ‘trickle down.’ The belief is that if you allow the rich to exploit andbecome richer that will create the money at the top which will ‘trickle down’ inwages and services to provide income for those further down the economic scale.The same justification is applied to countries. If the rich get richer they willtrade with the poor, and money will trickle down to them. The problem is that itdoesn’t work and the Brotherhood bankers know it doesn’t work. It is notsupposed to. Most of the money stays near the top of the pyramid, because thecloser you are to the top the more you get paid. Those at the bottom have tosurvive on the scraps that fall from the rich man’s table which, in a phrase, iswhat trickle down really is. At the bottom of the pyramid the majority of thepeople in the world struggle for, and often fail to find, even the basics ofhuman existence. The world has had well over a century of rapid economic growth,and yet half the population of the planet is in relative or absolute poverty.Around a billion are in absolute poverty, the definition of which is ‘acondition of life so characterised by malnutrition, illiteracy, and disease asto be beneath any reasonable definition of human decency’. But thegrowth-trickle-down fallacy has hypnotised all the political movements, theGreens apart. Ask a capitalist, communist, socialist, or liberal democrat for away forward economically, and they will give you a version of take, make andthrowaway based on trickle down.As the frequencies rise and consciousness expands, this illusion is beingrejected by millions of people, and the numbers will grow at an ever-quickeningrate. Even those who once dismissed or ignored the Green analysis are beginningto question openly the economic madness we are indoctrinated to worship. Thebillionaire financier, James Goldsmith, said this in the London Times:“Economic growth is the way to measure success, and science and technology areits principal tools. This is the basis of modern thought, but I question it. Theleading modern society, America, has produced the greatest surge in economicgrowth and material prosperity in history. In the past fifty years its grossdomestic product (GDP) has grown in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, from$1.5 trillion to $5.9 trillion. American science and technology have achievedincredible innovations. And yet, American society is deeply ill.”There will still be the Brotherhood fodder who try to retain and justify allthat I have described, because they believe it is best for them personally, orthey are closing their minds to the changing consciousness. But trying to propup this economic insanity will be like trying to plug holes in a crumbling dyke.For every leak you manage to repair temporarily, another dozen will be sprung,until the entire dyke is washed away. The economic system has to go, and we haveto stop cooperating with it. What we must be aware of is an engineered collapseof the global economy by the Brotherhood with the intention of introducing aworld central bank pledged to rebuild it. This is their intention and whileno-one wants The System to be dismantled more than I do, we must resistcentralisation and use the collapse to de-link from The System. We can expect acrash on the global stock markets which the Brotherhood would have no troubleinstigating and that will send The System into free fall. Insurance companiesfaced with more claims through crime and natural disasters, and fewer people whocan afford the rising premiums are already feeling the walls of change closingin. Add to this the financial implications of changing attitudes to life, theweather extremes, and geological events, and you can see the days are numberedfor the economics of the madhouse. The only danger, as I keep stressing, is ifwe allow the collapse to justify further centralisation. If that happens TheSystem will be rebuilt with even more control.So what can we do?I can’t say exactly what will happen, because no-one knows in detail what thefuture will bring or how humanity will use its free will to react. But if we areto end the power of an economic elite we need to move from the big to the small;from central control to community and individual control; from humans servingtechnology to technology serving humans. Awakening people are demanding thesechanges and they will be necessary anyway when the world economic order is holedbelow the water line and sinks. There is going to be a great deal of reacting toevents and we will have to move very quickly. We will see that we all depend oneach other, and community spirit is going to return in a very big way.Throughout the Industrial era, the trends have been in the other direction.Financial power has been concentrated in fewer and fewer hands by the cost ofinstalling mass-producing technology and the need to compete with othercountries. This has been the bankers’ doing. We have seen community businessesfail in the face of unfair, market-rigged, competition from the major banks andcorporations, all of which are Brotherhood controlled. National companies havegrown through this economic injustice to become multi-nationals which wieldenormous power around the world. Many of them have a bigger turnover every yearthan scores of countries, and that gives them the muscle to exploit thosecountries and even govern them from behind the scenes. This brings about thegrotesque sight of food-growing land in poor countries being used to grow luxurycrops for the rich. This is often at the instigation of Brotherhoodmulti-national corporations and corrupt politicians.In my book It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, there is a chapter entitled ‘EmptyBellies and Chocolate Bars’. It is so called because, according to Oxfam, wellover half the children in Ghana are malnourished, while half the food growingland in Ghana is growing cocoa for the western chocolate industry. Anotherstatistic I used in that book was that 400,000 children are reckoned to die inBrazil every year from hunger-related disease when Brazil is one of the biggestexporters of food in the world. While those children live and die in poverty,the land that could feed them is used to increase the profits of multi-nationalsand the rich world in general. This manipulation of trade and debt by the Westhas led to the almost unbelievable situation in which more money passes frompoor countries to rich every year than goes the other way. Remember that nexttime you see Western politicians talking about the ‘aid’ they are sending to thepoor, or when you hear people criticise such aid because ‘charity begins athome.’ No it doesn’t. Exploitation begins at home and is exported across theworld. In the new tomorrow the word charity will be used only in accounts ofhuman history. There will be giving and receiving, but there will be nodependence and therefore no ‘charity’. Charity exists today only becauseexploitation and manipulated dependency has created the need for it.The System controls us through dependence. It makes us dependent upon it for allthe necessities of life, food, clothing, warmth, and shelter. That has been itsLucifer-inspired ambition, and it has largely succeeded. This dependence onessentials means that we have to play The System’s game or we won’t survive. Thefirst priority of any new economics must be to reduce and then remove dependenceon The System for those things. Once you have adequate food, clothing, warmth,and shelter, you immediately have choices. You no longer have to do what TheSystem wants you to do. Removing dependence requires the dismantling ofcentralised power in all areas of our lives. Economically and politically itmeans small, not big, is beautiful.The emphasis will be on communities coming together to supply their own needs,and not being dependent on a system over which they have no control. It hasbecome so silly that if someone starts a rumour on the Tokyo stockmarket to makea financial killing, the knock-on effect can have consequences for the lives ofpeople living on the other side of the planet. Self-reliance andself-sufficiency in all essentials will be the basic model of future economics,because that decreases dependence and gives power back to people. In this viewof economics, the people of Ghana will be fed by food grown on their own land.The needs of their people will be served first, and not those of themulti-national chocolate factories. Poorer countries have been persuaded andmanipulated to believe that the best way for them to ‘succeed’ is to use theirland to grow cash crops for the Western multi-nationals and to use that money toimport food from the West. This means the West can’t lose. It can make thechocolate products to sell back to places like Ghana at a profit, and also sellsfood to them. Even better, it controls the price of both the cash crops itimports from those countries and the products and food it exports to them,because the West controls the financial system. Or rather the Brotherhood does.The countries of the Third World know that if they refuse to accept thisinjustice, the multi-nationals will move elsewhere as they play off one poorcountry against another. The way out of this bind of control through dependenceis to produce the essentials locally whenever possible. Local production forlocal need will be forced upon us anyway by weather, geological, political andeconomic upheavals. The only effective response to all this will come locally.Look at the chaos that one snow storm, hurricane, or period of heavy rain cancause. Imagine what will happen as all that increases. We are going to see justhow tenuous is our modern, technological, world when faced with the realitiesand power of nature.The GATT agreement which is designed to open up the world to ever greatercompetition by removing import barriers is the Illuminati elite at work again.If you want to create dependency on the System for all the countries of theworld, the myth of free trade has had to be sold and conditioned into peoplebecause without ‘free’ trade the strong could no longer exploit the weak onanything like the same scale. The truth is that trade has never been free inmodern society. It is a licence to exploit the weak. The GATT agreement is aneffort by the elite to create more control and dependence. Those politicians andeconomists who can’t see the real agenda promoted GATT in a desperate attempt tofind more places to sell products and generate ‘growth’. But of course there arestill only so many people and so much money, and for everyone who sells more asa result of this agreement someone else must sell less. The ones who sell morewill be those who sell cheapest, and they will be the ones prepared to exploitpeople and the planet more than the opposition. For every winner there must beeven more losers. We have turned trade and economics into a sporting contest, asort of Economic Olympics. We talk of ‘Japan pulling ahead’ or ‘Korea comingthrough fast’ while most of the world never even gets to the stadium.Events will unfold, I believe, that will reduce the production of oil, thecocaine of The System. It is addicted to oil and only survives by consuming andpricing it at levels which do not reflect the reality that it is finite and hasfantastic environmental costs. Take away oil and there is basically no System.If this happens it will bring an end to the ridiculous situation in which onecountry exports a product to the other side of the world while importing backacross the world that country’s version of the same product. It is justified inthe name of ‘choice’, but what is this choice? The choice of having ten, twenty,a hundred different shampoos to buy, all of which do the same basic job with thesame basic ingredients? What about the choice denied to people of going out inthe sunshine at certain times of the year because a system that speaks of’choice’ has so damaged the ozone layer that skin cancer is becoming an epidemicin some areas? Do you know that products are often transported from country tocountry with each one adding another component because that’s the cheapest wayfor multi-nationals to produce them? Our ports and airports are full of shipsand planes using fuel and resources and causing untold pollution when most of itis unnecessary. It serves no-one except multi-national corporations and thebankers. Far from supplying needs and ‘choice’ it is actually denying both tothe majority.In the years ahead, countries and communities are going to be more concernedwith supplying their own necessities than exporting their production across theplanet. This will unlock so much creativity. If the economic system is the waypeople are controlled and pressured to conform, think what opportunities awaitus as it collapses or we de-link ourselves from it and those pressures areremoved. The Chinese word for crisis, wei-chi, means both danger andopportunity. While the fall of The System may be seen as a danger to us, it isreally an opportunity to unleash all the infinite power of human ingenuity. Thishas been imprisoned by a system in which thinking is the last thing it wants usto do. Orders are issued from above by the few and the majority do as they aretold. They are not asked their opinion, they are treated like robots. If youwant to find the best way of doing something you don’t ask a manager in anoffice, you ask those who do the job day after day. But those people are rarelyconsulted. In the future there will be no ‘us’ and ‘them’, no orders from above.Those who currently impose their view on others are going to be in the same boatas everyone else as the Robots’ Rebellion gathers pace. The economicdisintegration caused by a variety of reasons will give us a blank sheet ofpaper on which to start again.The quickening frequencies are triggering within us the desire for control overour own lives. This is leading us towards smaller economic units and a wish towithdraw ourselves from the present system as much as we can. The necessities ofproviding for need in the wake of the collapse will demand the same course ofaction. In the transition period at least, the emphasis will be on barter –goods and services in exchange for goods and services with often little or nomoney changing hands. This expansion of barter is happening today. People whoare awakening are using it to step out of The System as much as they can and asunemployment rises millions are seeing that The System can no longer provide forthem and their families and has no prospect of doing so. This approach is goingto be vital, as social security payments are squeezed and used to turn peopleinto little more than slaves to the State.When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, which was published in 1990, Ihighlighted a barter system called LETS. At the time I could find only threeexamples of this at work in England. Today, only a few years later, there arecountless LETS Systems in action. LETS is short for Local Employment and TradeSystem and it overcomes the limitations of money. Under the present economicorder, money is everything. In a recession when money is tight, skills arelocked within people. The money is not there to pay them for their skills andallow them to pay others for theirs. Many of the needs of people and theircommunities go unmet when the skills are there to provide them. LETS releasesthose skills. It works like this:You invent a currency. The name doesn’t matter because it doesn’t actually existin physical form. They are just imaginary units of exchange. When you join aLETS group, you are given a list of all the skills and contributions beingoffered by the other members. You write down a list of all the things that youcan do. It can be anything from baby-sitting to repairing a house. If there issomething you need that a member of the group can provide, you contact them andagree a price in your unit of currency. On the Isle of Wight where I live, onegroup has called their currency ‘Wights’ and that is the name I will use here,but it could be anything. Let us say that you contact a car mechanic in thegroup and you agree a price of 50 Wights for him or her to repair your car. Whenthe job is done, you ring the LETS coordinator and you say ‘credit so and sowith 50 Wights and debit my account with the same.’ The mechanic now has fiftyunits which he or she can use to purchase your skills or anyone else’s in thegroup and you have committed yourself to giving 50 units worth of work to thegroup also.No money has changed hands, but you have your car repaired and the mechanic willbe paid in whatever services he or she might need. It may be that, for themoment, some money has to be spent on items purchased within The System, perhapssome spark plugs or engine parts in this case, but in some LETS groups evenshops are offering food and goods in exchange or part exchange for barter inthis way. You can take it further and have each member commit themselves to somany units of work a month for those in the community who cannot contributethrough illness or infirmity. But there are very few who cannot offer something.One way of running LETS is to have a rate per hour for everyone so all time ismeasured equally.You can start now, the sooner the better, to build a community economy asindependent as possible from the world system. The more we can live outside ofthat system, the more the power of the Brotherhood bankers is reduced. Put anadvertisement in the paper and call a public meeting or just gather a fewfriends around who you think might be interested. There might already be a LETSin your area which you can join. There are no rules that must be obeyed. Eachgroup works out what is best for them and learns with experience how best toproceed. These LETS groups can grow quite large, but it is best to keep them tomanageable numbers. It is important to have them up and running as soon aspossible to reduce dependency on the Brotherhood and to limit the chaos andsuffering when the present system collapses.In the new people’s economics we will need local cooperatives andcommunity-owned companies for food distribution. It is simply daft for food tobe grown in one area and sent long distances to other communities while thosecommunities send their produce in the other direction. Food cooperatives willhave the role of collecting the food from local farmers and growers anddistributing this to local shops and markets. To be truly responsive to localneeds, these cooperatives should be controlled by representatives of ALL thecommunity, not only the farmers and growers. We will require communityorganisations, again with all views and needs represented, to coordinate theproduction and distribution of the necessities of life to everyone in theircommunity. Their brief will be to ensure that no-one goes without food, warmth,clothing, and shelter. This can be provided much more quickly and efficiently bylocal communities once they can control their own lives and be freed from thebarriers presented by the current system to any form of activity which operatesindependently of its structure. These community economic cooperatives will alsohave the role of identifying the goods and produce imported into a communitywhich could be produced locally. They will then seek ways to replace the importswith local production. There can be local currencies to work alongside barterand community banks will be developed to channel local money into the localeconomy. These banks should not make money out of money, only cover their costs.If we are going to bring in the changes to ensure that economics serves people,the system of making money out of money must end. To type in numbers on acomputer screen and then charge interest for lending money that doesn’t existhas to stop if the control is going to stop. Money should be a form of exchangeand a measurement of productive activities, not a way of increasing your wealthfor doing nothing. This ethos has turned the global economy into a giant casinowith the table rigged against all but the few.I am not suggesting that communities cut themselves off from each other in thelocal economies. Quite the opposite. There will still be trade where possible,but it will be for the mutual and equal benefit of both communities involved andlargely based on an exchange system of barter rather than a financialtransaction. I do not see trade in necessities except where one community cannotprovide them for itself. As you will see in the next chapter I am saying that weneed closer links between communities not an intensification of division. Butwhy does unnecessary and destructive economic activity which makes allcommunities dependent on outside forces have to be a basis for cooperating witheach other? Surely the fierce competition between communities that such a systemcreates discourages the very cooperation we wish to see.It is time for people of all backgrounds, creeds, colours, and views to cometogether and cooperate for the good of the whole and not compete for the good ofthe few. I can recommend a book called After The Crash by Guy Dauncey (GreenPrint) which offers lots of advice and examples of how to build a local economyin which people can free themselves from the clutches of national andinternational control. Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t possible. It is, andit is happening now. Local production for local need is the direction in whichwe are being guided by changing consciousness and economic necessity. We willalso realise from these experiences that we have been indoctrinated to accept aperverted view of efficiency. We have been sold the line that says if youcentralise your production you can produce things cheaper. This might be true ina few cases, but not the majority. Most of these products are only cheaper inthe shops because they do not reflect the full cost of producing anddistributing them. Let me give you an idea of what I mean.If something is made or grown locally and sold as near as possible to where itis produced, the price will reflect virtually the full cost of production anddistribution. Not all of it, but most of it. That is not the case withcentralised production. When you centralise you need massive trucks to deliverthose products. You need millions of them and they must get bigger and moredestructive as the centralisation intensifies. They consume fossil fuels at abreathtaking rate with the trucks capable of less than ten miles to the gallon.To cope with these trucks we have to build more motorways and by-passes atincredible cost. We have to spend money repairing the motorways and roads, thewater and gas pipes, buildings and pavements, all damaged by the ever increasingweight of the trucks. We have to pay in medical costs for the growth in roadaccidents and ill health caused by pollution and the stress of living alongsideroads full of traffic and trucks which shake your home and deny you peace andquiet. We have to spend more on the welfare system, because people-basedbusinesses which served their local communities have been closed down bymachine-based giants who largely serve only their shareholders and profitmargins. Financial speculation, not human need, dominates industry-just as theIlluminati Protocols said it would.None of these costs I have listed are reflected in the price of the productsthat are produced in this way. You pay for them once at the shop and again inyour taxes, while the costs in environmental destruction are not evenacknowledged. They are passed on to future generations which, throughreincarnation, could be us! All this creates an illusion of efficiency which hashoodwinked billions of people into accepting centralisation as ‘progress’. Whenthose costs have to be reflected in the price on the shelf, local productionwill often be shown to be cheaper, especially the essentials like food. Packagedand factory-prepared food is far more expensive than buying fresh food locallyand preparing it yourself. The national and multi-national food conglomerateshave to find ways of taking a potato or a carrot and adding as much to its valueas they can. They do this by turning out processed, conveyor belt, ‘convenience’food in the form of crisps or pies or whatever. And because food produced inthis way has to travel long distances before being eaten, chemicals andpreservatives have to be added which increase the cost of the medical servicesby the effect they have on the human body. This is on top of the poisons thefood already contains as a consequence of chemical-based farming methods. Thefood giants can ensure big profits from what started out as a potato orvegetable costing only a few pennies. We will see the return of buying freshfood locally and preparing it at home at a much cheaper cost in the years ahead.The centralisation of production and political control has brought about thedeath of community. The System’s policy of divide and rule has destroyed so muchcommunity spirit, cooperation and local self-reliance. Local post offices andsmall shops have closed. So have local schools and children have to be bussedout of their community to big, often impersonal, centralised schools. Theirparents have also had to travel longer distances to work as centralisation hasclosed local firms and created the need for mass commuting with all the road,public transport, and pollution costs that entails. People are forced to beginand end each working day in traffic jams or crowded trains alongside others inthe same situation. More of their time is taken by working and travelling, andless is available for families, friends, and life in the community. Governmentstalk of the need for ‘family values’ while promoting a system that breaks upfamilies for most of every day, and creates pressures that many relationships donot survive. More people are now realising that if you can reduce your number of‘wants’, you need less money to live. Simplifying your life like this can freethose most precious of gifts – time and choice.Yet another consequence of centralisation has been the dependence of communitieson one or very few companies for their economic stability. When those industriesfalter or the companies decide it is better for them to centralise elsewhere,the communities are devastated because their economic base is so small anddependent on so few. Community economies of the kind that will evolve in theyears ahead will not suffer from such lack of diversity.The multi-nationals who use their power to exploit people and the planet willnot survive the transformation. The expansion of consciousness will ensure thattheir days will pass. Business will go through a fundamental reassessment ofvalues and motivations, because the evolution of consciousness is not limited tothe weak and the poor. It is touching everyone who is prepared to open theirmind and go with the gathering flow. I wish to emphasise again that in mycritique of the economic system I am not condemning or judging people. I amchallenging the thought patterns that control the people who serve The System.Managing directors living their lives under the daily and growing pressures ofserving balance sheets and growth figures are as much victims of this madness asthose they employ, or don’t employ, on the factory floor.With every day, more of the ‘winners’ are finding their work unfulfilling andwithout meaning. Their true selves are rising to the surface and new views andvalues are entering their consciousness. As this continues, they will be askingmany questions they have never asked before. These questions will include: Whatis my business really here for? What are we really here for? Is it merely toaccumulate money as fast as possible? Is that all that life is about? Are wehere to be terrified of not selling more things every year? I know that manybusiness executives are already asking these questions and are realising thatthey are victims also. The new business that will emerge from the ashes of theold will be there to serve rather than exploit and it will judge its success bythese criteria:(1) Is the process of producing, distributing and selling the product damagingin any way to the planet and the natural life support systems?(2) Is the business exploiting the world rather than making a contribution tohealing the world, serving human need, and making it a better place for allpeople and life-forms?(3) Is the business harming or exploiting animals mentally, emotionally orphysically and causing them pain and stress of any kind?(4) Is the business exploiting people to maximise profits? Is it paying themless than their work is worth because I can use my economic power to make themaccept whatever they are offered? Am I exploiting my suppliers or weakercountries and peoples by abusing my economic power over them?(5) For the business to win, does it require that other people or countries mustlose?(6) Do those working in the business feel a part of the decision-making processand empowered to release their full creativity, or do they feel their creativityhas to conform to some rigid corporate structure in which the maximisation ofprofit is the only driving force?If the answer to any of those questions is ‘yes’ we are looking at a businessthat is going to be submerged in the changing consciousness in the collectivemind of the human race. The new business will seek to ensure that economicactivity leads to everyone winning from any situation and that includes theEarth. We are moving from win-lose economics to win-win economics. The newbusiness will have no rigid structures. Instead it will evolve its ways ofworking and operation from foundation values like caring, sharing, compassion,environmental responsibility, love in its widest sense, peace, harmony, truth,justice, and respect. From these principles each business will evolve in waysthat best suit its community and the people involved. Diversity and variety willreplace the centralised uniformity of today. You can go to almost any city inthe world and see the same names and shop fronts, all coordinated by somecentralised multi-national corporation.One culture created in the United States is being imposed upon the whole ofhumanity with the bulk of the profits going back to head office at the expenseof the local people and their indigenous culture. The kind of changes that I amdescribing will put a stop to this cancerous expansion. An executive from amulti-national fashion corporation told me that he was already seeing thisrejection of uniformity showing itself in their sales figures. They could nolonger sell one design all over the world. People were looking for individualdesigns that allowed them to express their individuality. It may appear to be acontradiction, but the move towards an understanding of the Oneness of allconsciousness will lead to a desire by people to express themselves in ways thatemphasise the infinite variety within that Whole.The re-balancing of the planet is happening on all levels and affecting allthings. The re-connection of lower and higher self will lead to a rebalancing ofeconomics and business practice. Those who try to continue with the old methodsand motivations will find themselves struggling to sell their products. TheSystem has been created to appeal to the five physical senses. Products andadvertising have been geared to this and the five senses have largely made thedecision on what and where to buy. Now other senses are coming into play. Theseare the higher senses that work through intuition. They are often referred to inevery day conversation as a ‘sixth sense’, although there are many levels ofthem. These are becoming more influential in decision-making as people awaken.Everything is energy and absorbs energy. The energy in a production process istransferred to the product and that energy, consciousness, will reflect theintent behind the product. If the intent is only to make as much money aspossible, the product will carry that thought pattern. If the productioninvolves environmental degradation, that, too, will be in the energy field ofthe product.This has not really mattered to companies so far because the five senses do notrelate directly to that energy field of the product. They relate to its feel,smell, taste, look or sound. But as growing millions become more sensitive tohigher levels of themselves, they will be tuning into the energy fields ofeverything and everyone – including products in the shops. They will sense onthese intuitive levels the intent behind a product. They won’t be saying: ‘OhI’ll buy this pair of jeans because I can sense that the intent of the companyis to serve, not exploit’. They will simply pick one product and not anotherbecause their intuition will encourage them to do so. They won’t know why theyare choosing that product. They will just do it. This will mean big trouble forthose companies which produce with negative intent and they will be rackingtheir brains trying to work out why people are rejecting their goods when thereappears to be no explainable reason why this should suddenly be so.There will be two stages in the transformation of economics and business. Thefirst stage will be the acceleration in the break down of the old and attemptsby the Brotherhood to use that situation to bring in their World Central Bank,one currency and eventually a cashless system based on a personal microchip.From the chaos that will follow this period, the new will emerge. There will bea great deal of ad-libbing and reacting to events. It will be a time when barterwill be essential and we will have to help each other on the basis of need. Newtechnologies will be discovered which I will talk about later which willtransform our lives. This technology will give us all the power and warmth weneed without touching or harming the physical Earth – and it is technology thatalready exists. The second stage will see the consolidation of the new economicsand technologies as the old fades to become history. As the decades of the nextcentury come and go and the frequencies go on rising, humanity will build a newworld of amazing and wondrous potential. What we would call miracles will be asmuch a part of everyday life as take, make, and throwaway is today.I cannot stress enough the importance of distinguishing between the transitionperiod and the world that will follow. Yes, of course, there will be traumatictimes. This always happens when one era is replaced rapidly by another. I cansee shortages of food perhaps and much upheaval. But the transformation to ahigher consciousness is not leading us back to caves, hardship and struggle. Ifyou want a system that brings hardship and struggle, then stick with the presentone. That delivers both with unwavering efficiency. The transformation isguiding us to an era of abundance in the next century. When the destructive wayshave been replaced and the Brotherhood’s control dismantled, the Earth will beabundant in her gifts of food and beauty. Love will replace hate and cooperationwill replace competition. The present system does not want abundance. Its poweris in scarcity. That increases the price, the profit, and the ability tocontrol.We will see that life is meant to be a joy. We are not here to be victims and itwasn’t supposed to be like this. Deep down beneath the layers of conditioning,the robots know this is true and the memories of that truth are beginning tostir within the hearts of those who have the will and the vision to think forthemselves. Knowledge and understanding is starting to surface and the robotsare rebelling. Not everyone will make that choice, perhaps the majority willnot. But many will and they will change the world. Change and necessity shallfree all our pent-up, locked-up, creativity, love, and passion for living. Wewill see human nature in its fullest and most glorious expression. We willdiscover potential within us that we never believed possible. Humans are notsinners who must find Jesus to be ‘saved’. We have been misguided andmisdirected by a disconnection from our true selves, that’s all. There-connection into Wholeness will bring a transformation of outlook and valuesthat will rid this planet of the ills that currently overwhelm humanconsciousness. It will also wrest control from the forces that seek to destroy.All is thought and thought is all. Nothing happens in the physical world whichhas not been preceded by a thought. Physical actions are manifestations ofthought. If thought is imbalanced and destructive so will be the physical world.If thought is balanced, loving, and constructive, that is the society that willemerge. We create our own reality, and that is why vision is so important. Thegreater the vision the greater the reality. The old vision had money, productionand exploitation as its focus. That is the reality it has created. The newvision is about respect and love for all life and all that is Creation. This isthe world that is soon to be."},{"pageContent":"16The Politics of PeopleONE of the greatest myths known to the human race is that politicians havepower. It is simply not true.How can 365 Members of Parliament in Britain have power over a population ofsome 57 million? Or a President have power over 250 million Americans? Theycan’t. Their only power is in persuading us that they have power. Likeeverything on this physical level, it is an illusion.I mentioned earlier that, towards the end of British rule in India, Gandhi toldthe colonial government, ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indiansif those Indians will not cooperate’. In that one sentence you can see where thereal power lies. It lies with us, the mass of the people, and not withgovernments, armies, industrial conglomerates, or the Brotherhood. They onlyappear to have power because of the apathy and indoctrination of the robots.Once enough robots wake up and rebel we will see what a sleight of hand thisbusiness of ‘power’ really is. I feel for politicians. In many ways, they arethe biggest victims, the most programmed of robotic beings. They change nothingwhich is not acceptable to The System. The economic madness which they havehelped to unleash across the world has imprisoned them and their successors.They are no more free to act on fundamental issues than a prisoner in Dartmooror San Quentin. At election time, they have to tell people what they believeenough of them want to hear. If they don’t do that, they don’t get elected. Andwhat do most people want to hear from their politicians? What the system hasindoctrinated them to demand. More growth, possessions, money and economic‘success’ for their country.Politicians are pawns being moved around a board by the Brotherhood, aprogrammed population and the interdependency The System has constructed.Politicians cannot act independently in one country because they are linked to asystem which insists that they play by its rules. If they seek to limit importsof unnecessary goods which their country is capable of making for itself, othersimmediately take action to block their country’s exports. Even those politicianswho have seen the system for what it is – and there are painfully few – wouldrecoil at the prospect of taking any action that would bring with it a chaoticbut vital period of transition while their economy was recovering from thecolossal blow of losing export revenue and redirecting itself into producing thegoods it had been importing until then.Any government which tried to do this would be overthrown either democraticallyor by force. The System has the politicians slavishly serving its wishes throughmanipulation, indoctrination and fear. They will never take the action necessaryto free humanity from its imprisonment or the planet from her punishment. Onlyby The System’s collapse and its replacement by another way of thinking can webe freed from our dependency and be able to step into an era of economic sanity.Essential to this is an end to politics as we know it. Representatives of thepeople are there to serve those people, not their party or self-interest. It issuch an insult to the word democracy to see politicians allowing themselves tobe used like fodder to vote in Congress, the House of Commons and the otherparliaments of the world in whatever way their party leaders tell them. They arethe prisoners of the Whip system. The Whips are party officials who are there toensure that the Members of Parliament the population has elected follow thewishes of their party and never the urgings of their conscience or what theybelieve are the needs of the people. Parliaments are, appropriately, microcosmsof the whole system. You have the few at the top like the Prime Minister and theCabinet, or the President and his advisors, who try to force their Members ofParliament or Congress to toe their line. They, in turn, most of them withoutrealising it, serve the non-elected Brotherhood above them. Political leadersoften talk of the need for people to show self responsibility, but they are thelast ones who want to see any such thing – especially in their own party. WhenMPs take responsibility for their own thoughts and vote with their beliefs, theyare ‘disciplined’ by their party and told they will never be considered forpromotion. This is democracy?I remember when I was a national speaker for the British Green Party, theConservative Government introduced a Poll Tax which was deeply unfair in that itasked the poor to pay the same as the rich. The strength of the protests and acampaign of non-payment forced the Government to scrap it (people power again).At the time, the Environment Secretary vehemently supported the tax andcondemned those who challenged its unfairness. It was he who guided the billthrough parliament to bring the Poll Tax into law. Some years later, that sameman was interviewed on a programme looking back at the years of MargaretThatcher as Prime Minister. He said he had always believed the Poll Tax wasunworkable and should never have been introduced. He had, he claimed, even saidthis to Margaret Thatcher before he had agreed to introduce it. On the sameprogramme, the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Poll Tax said thathe, too, had told Mrs Thatcher it was a ridiculous idea. The film cut from himto archive footage of Margaret Thatcher proclaiming the Poll Tax at aConservative Party Conference. Sitting close by and clapping all that she saidwas that same Chancellor of the Exchequer who, in private, was saying it shouldnever be introduced.Stories like that and much, much, worse could be repeated many times inparliaments all over the world. Let us not avoid the issue here. The politicalsystem and the economic system are one and the same. They are indivisible. Bothare sick, corrupt, stupid, self-destructing and Brotherhood-controlled. Like theeconomic order, the political circus has created mechanisms and structures forturning out the robots and clones it needs to survive. Unless you are asystem-serving, toe-the-liner, you will struggle to be selected to represent amajor party in an election. Some people with a mind of their own slip throughthis net, but they are so few they can be muzzled or made impotent even if theyare elected. The attitudes to life you need to become an MP or a Senator aremostly the opposite of what is required for honest, fair and inspiredgovernment.“The political has nothing in common with the moral. The ruler who is governedby the moral is not a skilled politician and is therefore unstable on histhrone. He who wishes to rule must have recourse to both cunning and to makebelieve. Great national qualities like frankness and honesty are vices inpolitics, for they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively andmore certainly than the most powerful enemy.” (Illuminati Protocol 1).Like the economic system, politics has become ever more centralised through thiscentury. British local government has had responsibilities and decision-makingon many issues removed by Westminster; and Westminster is surrenderingresponsibilities to the European Community. Others have done the same. It is allleading towards the Brotherhood dream of a World Government and I even hear someintelligent, caring people supporting the idea, often from the best ofintentions. I say again and again… NO, NO NO. As with most changes that givepower to the few, it can be presented as highly desirable. If we had a WorldGovernment, they say, we could stop this or stop that, do this, or do that.Others believe that the move towards World Government is a natural part of ourevolution and journey towards wholeness. We started in tribes and communities,this way of thinking suggests, and we are evolving through national andcontinental government to World Government. I challenge this view. Worldcooperation and World Government are not the same thing. Does anyone reallythink that a World Government convened under the present system is going to beany less sick, corrupt, stupid and self-destructive than national orinternational governments? Of course not. But we are not looking here at agovernment that has the potential to inflict all these things on a singlecountry. We are talking about the world.Both sides of the left-right political spectrum have those who support the idea,but then, as with most things, the idea of left and right is another illusion.They are different aspects of the same bubble of unreality – and manipulation.The Brotherhood does not have a political line. It will use anyone or anythingfor its own ends. In its ranks and under its influence are politicians of allkinds and persuasions. The Communists and the capitalists speak the samelanguage. Communism is merely a more authoritarian form of capitalism, anyway.Politicians, even the high-ranking ones, are mere front men and women comparedwith those working behind the scenes. President Reagan was an excellent exampleof this. He fired the bullets, but others loaded the gun. Imagine what controlcould be gifted to a tiny group of people if World Government became a reality.It would have nothing to do with the evolution to wholeness and everything to dowith controlling the lives of six billion people. The way to avoid this is topass decision-making and control down the line to people and communities and notto create the final rung on the ladder to world domination. We should demandthis and refuse to cooperate with the present system.Look at examples of how global political-economic organisations, already inexistence, have behaved. Those Brotherhood creations, the International MonetaryFund and the World Bank, are there to make sure the system is served under allcircumstances. When Third World countries begin to struggle to pay back debts tothe rich, in goes the IMF to lend them yet more money that doesn’t exist andwhich they will not be able to repay. In return for this ‘help’, the IMF insistson measures to cut back on spending on the poor, healthcare, education and foodsubsidies.This brings more pain and suffering for the population. They also insist thatthose countries increase their exports to raise money. More food-growing landgoes under cash crop production. But, with the IMF telling scores of countriesto do this, the market is flooded with certain commodities or goods and theprice collapses. They are all exporting more, but earning less. Who wins? TheWest. It has to pay less for its imports. The World Bank (not to be confusedwith a World Central Bank) is supposed to invest in projects to help the poorercountries. Instead, it has been responsible for investment in Third Worldcountries that have destroyed their environment, put local farmers out ofbusiness and made western companies richer at the expense of the very countrythe bank was supposed to be assisting.If economic control is to be devolved to communities, political decision-makingmust be similarly devolved. This will be resisted by national and internationalgovernments. They will be desperate to maintain their control and this isanother reason why the economic crash is necessary. Take economics out ofnational and international governments and there is little left for them to dounder the present order. These governments are, in effect, only stewards of theworld economic system on behalf of the banking elite. No-one is going to takeany notice of them when the priority for everyone is the provision of essentialsafter the crash. They will be politicians with no-one to govern.The breakdown of the old can only lead to a return to local decision-making, ifwe reject the Brotherhood plans. There will be no other way to cope and reactsuccessfully to what will need to be done. Eventually we will see the end ofpolitical parties. They are the product of a divided humanity and have no placein the new tomorrow. Like all ‘isms’ they insist that their members serve theism first and their hearts and conscience second. They battle for power byoffering the same basic policies presented in slightly different languages but,the Greens apart, they all serve the system and their members serve them.Indeed, some elements of Green politics are also system-serving withoutrealising it. Political parties have also added to the confrontational nature ofpolitics which mirrors the lack of cooperation that pervades the entire system.Politicians, in general, have sought office to achieve power. They want absolutepower to impose their views upon the population. They will deny this but that iswhat they want, collectively. The electoral system in Britain gives control ofdecision-making to parties which considerably less than half the population havevoted for. This is all old age nonsense.Politicians should be there to empower people. The key words are enable, allowand respect. To enable people to realise their full potential and follow theirown instincts; to allow people to do whatever they wish and live in any way theychoose as long as it does not cause harm to others; and to respect the rights ofall people to control their own lives and make their own choices. Therepresentative is a servant, not a dictator. Modern politics has got the twomixed up. From these principles, communities will decide on a system ofrepresentation that suits them. There will be no imposition of rigid structuresby national and international governments once the transformation is well underway. Communities will be in control. I see elected representation as only partof community action. With the new consciousness, cooperating will come naturallywithout the need for laws and regulations of the kind we have so many of today.The world is drowning in laws and legislation because of the desire to controlpeople and in response to the negative behaviour of those disconnected fromtheir true selves. Representation will evolve with rising consciousness and inreaction to the collapse of the old structures. But, here are a few ideas whichare likely to play some part in the new politics in the post-Brotherhood world:⋆ I think we will see neighbourhood councils representing groups of houses andstreets. If someone is lonely or hungry or in any sort of need, it will be therole of the neighbourhood council to take the necessary action. They will notring Social Services because Social Services won’t exist in the way that it doestoday. Everything will be on a smaller, community scale. The explosion in theWelfare State and Social Services has been a reaction to the collapse ofcommunity. Now that the Brotherhood elite have largely achieved that, they willseek to squeeze the welfare services. Neighbourhood councils will alert thepeople of their area as to what needs to be done and will sort it outthemselves, whenever possible. You could set up a neighbourhood council whereyou live, today. Through this, you could co-ordinate the care of the people inyour area by the people in your area. There is no need to wait for the crash. Itis a tragedy that so many do not even know who lives in the flat next door, letalone at the end of the street. Centralisation and the system of divide andrule, have brought this about. It is time to change this but it will not beeasy. It will take commitment and there will be many people who fearparticipation because they have been programmed to believe that they are here tofollow, not to lead. But these changes will happen because circumstances andawakening consciousness will demand them. The more we can de-link from thesystem now and prepare the groundwork for community organisation, the smootherthe transition will be.⋆ Neighbourhood councils will have a representative on the Community Council.How big an area these Community Councils will cover will be decided by thepeople involved, in consultation with other communities around them. I would seeelected community councils working alongside community forums. These forumswould be open to everyone to present their views and suggestions for ways ofimproving the community. They would allow the knowledge and ingenuity of peopleto be given a hearing. Today, we have professional politicians making decisionsabout subjects they know little or nothing about. Those who are close to thesesubjects are never asked to speak in the debates or to offer their insight intoproblems which they work with every day. Giving people that opportunity in thepresent system of centralised control is almost impossible because there are toomany people involved. But, in a community situation, that would not be the case.Everything would take place on a human scale. Even now, under the presentsystem, there is no reason why community forums could not be organised to give aplatform for local views and action. Indeed, this is happening as awakeningpeople follow their instincts.The elected community council would attend these regular forums and listen tothe people they represent. The councils would consist of people elected fromright across society. Besides representatives from each neighbourhood therewould be the opportunity for all sections of society to have an electedspokesperson – food producers, shopkeepers, employees, environmental groups,young people, old people, and so on.I would suggest a similar dual approach to economic organisation. Electedrepresentatives to a community economic cooperative would coordinate theday-to-day organisation and development of the community economy while aneconomic forum would allow everyone to contribute to the discussions on economicmatters. People are much more enthusiastic and motivated when they know theyhave the opportunity to contribute and make a difference. You will be amazed athow many apparently insuperable problems can be solved once human ingenuity isharnessed to its full potential. The task for these community economies in thetransition period will be to provide food, shelter, warmth and clothing foreveryone and to do it in ways that are environmentally sustainable.⋆ I would see the main roles of regional government to be the following: Tosupport the communities in their efforts to be self-reliant in all essentials;to ensure that essentials which cannot be provided locally are provided fromsurpluses in other communities; to coordinate necessary trade betweencommunities to the mutual benefit of both; to be a forum for communities toexchange information and experiences; to pass on details of new discoveries andtechnology which would benefit communities and add to their self-reliance; toarbitrate in disagreements between communities; and to ensure that the actionsof one community do not adversely affect another, either economically orenvironmentally. The regional level will be particularly important in thetransition period in organising food distribution to the big urban areas whichdo not have enough food-growing land to feed themselves.⋆ I do not believe the present national governments, as such, will be necessary,although groups of regions may choose to get together to support each other. Thenext level of representation after regional could be continental. These would beareas covered today by the European Community or the United States and Canada –that sort of size. I would see these as forums and coordinators, notgovernments. This is very different from the present European Community modelwhich is little more than an economic trading bloc with system-serving andcentralising motivations. The continental forum I am thinking of would be ameeting place where regional representatives could exchange ideas and discussissues of mutual interest. This level would arbitrate on disagreements betweenregions, ensure that one region was not harming others economically andenvironmentally, and help to identify and direct the essentials of food, warmth,clothing and shelter to regions which were not yet self-reliant or which werestruggling, temporarily, from the effects of natural disasters. They would alsocoordinate relief operations in places where natural disasters had occurred,with expertise, transport and technology on permanent standby to be on the scenein the shortest possible time. This would be a kind of Global InternationalRescue which all communities and regions could call upon.⋆ The other level of representation would be the World Forum. This is not thesame as World Government. It would be a place where representatives from thecontinental forums would meet to discuss topics that affected the whole world.It would arbitrate in disagreements between continents and coordinate theprovision of essentials which a continent was unable, at any stage, to providefor itself. The World Forum would have no army at its disposal and, apart frompowers to intervene to prevent environmental degradation that had globalimplications, it would have no other power to impose its decisions. All armieswill be dismantled when the transformation of consciousness is well underway. Iwould also see the World Forum as a body that would represent the planet informal interaction with other Universal Civilisations which are going to beopenly visiting this planet and we theirs in the future just as we visit othercountries today. We desperately need forms of democracy that empower and involveall people. The present ‘democracies’ were created by the Brotherhood withbuilt-in flaws to ensure they were only illusions of freedom:“All these so called ‘People’s Rights’ can exist only in idea, an idea which cannever be realised in practical life. What is it to the proletariat labourer,bowed double over his heavy toil, crushed by his lot in life, if talkers get theright to babble, if journalists get the right to scribble any nonsense side byside with the good stuff? The proletariat has no other profit out of theconstitution save only those pitiful crumbs which we fling them from our tablein return for voting in favour of what we dictate, in favour of men we place inpower…” (Illuminati Protocol 3).This devolution of economic and representative power to communities withsupport, but not control, from above has built-in environmental benefits.People, as a rule, do not wish to pollute their own neighbourhood. Nationalgovernments give permission for polluting factories to be imposed only on thosecommunities where they don’t have to live themselves. The main motivation of anational government is economic growth, not the wishes of one community. Withdecision-making transferred to community level, the incentives to rejectpolluting technology are far greater. If you are seeking to be self-reliant youare going to look after your environment as a first priority because that isyour self-reliance. The link between a sustainable environment and a sustainableeconomy will be staring you in the face every day.This structure is not a model for the future written in stone. I have onlyoutlined a few ideas to illustrate some of the trends that are already quietlyunderway and which will come to the fore as the transition proceeds to challengethe Brotherhood nightmare of central control. I expect the economics andrepresentation of the future to be much more diverse than a single, setstructure. In every community and region there will be variations on the themeof self-reliance in essentials and decision-making at the lowest level possible.There will be many difficulties and complications to overcome because thesetrends are faced with a world that has been geared and created to serve a verydifferent system. Communities and regions do not break down into neatly packagedunits with the ideal ratio of farmland to people. We have appalling urbansprawls and it will be some time before anything like the ideas I have putforward will be reality world-wide. There will be a lot of chaos, hard work andlearning from experience before that can happen. What we can do is make a startnow and try to de-link ourselves as much from the system as we can.It is worth noting again that the fewer material wants we have the less we needto work and earn to live. This frees more time for us to do what we really wantto do. If we simplify our material lives we give ourselves choices which aredenied us if we work, work, work to chase the material dream and its symbols of‘success’. We need to free ourselves from the so-called work ethic. This insiststhat, unless we are in paid employment all day, at least five days a week, weare lazy and work-shy. What rubbish. But what could be better for the systemover the last two hundred years than for us to believe in the work ethic and itsmisguided morality? With people rejecting this conditioning and givingthemselves time and opportunity to use their full creativity, we will see suchchanges for the better; an explosion in the arts for a start. Music, inparticular, has a fundamental role to play in using its vibrations to raise thefrequency of the planet, although it can be used to do the opposite in the wronghands. We are going to discover more notes and tones as the changes gather pace.People think that the collapse of the present order will see us living in cavesand tents for evermore. But the release of human creativity will lead us into aworld of abundance. Being poor is not purity, it is poverty, and we will havethe means to remove this cancer. Ours will be a world that celebrates andencourages beauty, style and excellence in all things. The idea, put forward bysome, that living rough has some kind of spiritual street-cred is a delusion, Ifeel. The transformation is about balance while poverty is an obvious sign ofimbalance within a society.Two areas related to political and economic change are the media and what welaughingly call justice. The media, or most of it, is the propaganda machine ofthe present system. Nowhere do the mainstream newspapers, magazines, radio andtelevision programmes question the obsession with growth and free trade, exceptin the rarest of circumstances. The only questions they ask are how best tostimulate both. They never ask why these things are so desirable and what theconsequences of them are. The media depends on the system to survive and offersall the support it can. It is also Brotherhood-controlled. The media has alloweditself to become the vehicle for selling the American (Brotherhood) culture tothe world. In its raw state, the media is like knowledge. It is neither negativenor positive. It is how it is used that is negative and positive. Someindividuals in the media already do some outstanding work, exposing exploitationand hypocrisy and highlighting injustices that need to be addressed – but theyare a depressing few. Local radio stations can be wonderful sources ofinformation close to the people and they are going to be crucial in times ofturmoil and change. The media could be used to communicate understanding andinformation that would free humanity. Instead, its overwhelming contribution isto imprison our thinking because its own thinking is imprisoned.“We must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the directionfavoured by our widely conceived plan, already approaching the desiredconsummation, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted byus through the means of that so called ‘Great Power’ – the Press, which, with afew exceptions that may be disregarded, is already entirely in our hands.”(Illuminati Protocol 7).“What is the part played by the Press today? It serves to excite and inflamethose passions which are needed for our purpose or else serves selfish ends ofparties. It is often vapid, unjust, mendacious, and the majority of the publichave not the slightest idea what ends the press really serves…“…All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions – aristocratic,republican, revolutionary, even anarchical – for so long as the constitutionsexist… Every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions asrequired. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in the directionof our aims… Those fools who will think they are repeating the opinion of anewspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion thatseems desirable to us.” (Protocol 12).I have been explaining in countless press interviews about the eternal nature ofall consciousness, the frequencies, the so-called great mysteries of life, andwhy we are having extremes of weather and seeing the old order crumble. Only avery few have printed a word of this. They come along being nice to my face andgo away to their typewriters to undermine what I am doing. All they have wantedto do is talk about my private life and to misrepresent what I am saying toencourage the belief that I am crazy. I am challenging religion. They say I havediscovered religion. I am questioning most of the Bible. They present me as aBible-basher. I challenge the whole idea of ‘Messiahs’. They say I am claimingto be one. And mind-controlled people believe this stuff. They say, ‘You shouldnever believe what you read in the papers’, but they go ahead and do exactlythat.One journalist, who accepts the themes of what I am saying, wrote an article fora newspaper about me. The editor rejected it because it was ‘too positive’. Ipredicted in 1991 that we would see record-breaking weather extremes in thisdecade, particularly rains and floods. At a time when France, the Netherlandsand Germany were suffering from terrible floods and the Isle of Wight, where Ilive, was being battered by rains which would lead to some of the worst floodsthe island has seen, a journalist rang my home. Did he want to talk about theweather, why it was happening and what we could do about it? Not quite.“Who do you think should be the new manager of the England soccer team?”, heasked.On one occasion a friend in Scotland told me of an article in the Scottish DailyRecord which had said I was a ‘Cult Lord’. As I had already written severalbooks opposing the whole idea of cults, I was interested to see how the papercould justify such a claim. Across the top of the page was a giant headline ‘TheCult Lords’. Underneath were articles about various people. David Koresh, whowas at the centre of the siege in Waco,* Texas, was among them and there,alongside the mass murderer Charles Manson, was me! I wrote to the editor askinghow on earth that could be justified and he replied that they had not suggestedI was a cult leader!! And because of the injustice of the ‘justice’ system,which is only there for the rich in these cases, there was nothing I could do.I’m sure there will be more character assassination to come in an effort todiscredit the information in this book.These are examples of the kind of mentality which mostly governs the stories youread and hear in the media. I have worked on local newspapers and in regionaland national television and radio. I have seen how journalists are some of themost programmed beings on the planet. Not all of them, but the majority.Especially at the extreme end. I dread to think of the karma they are collectingevery day as they go about their business of distorting, lying and destroyinglives. What they do to others, they will need to face themselves on the journeyof evolution if their actions are motivated by negative intent. Likepoliticians, I feel for them. They know not what they do. They are de-linkedfrom their higher selves and locked within a media structure that programmesthem to programme others with their trivia, drivel, untruths, narrow vision andBrotherhood propaganda. When they leave the confines of the physical body theywill be horrified at how they have allowed the system to control them. Mostjournalists are puppets of fear and negative thought patterns, but they don’thave to be. They are not bad people. They are misguided and they have the choiceto change. Fortunately, the awakening process is there for everyone and manyjournalists are opening their consciousness to new ideas. Their problem isgetting past the editors and the newspaper owners who block information becausethey don’t want to hear it or allow others to hear it. I laugh when the mediacomplain of press censorship when the biggest censors of information are themedia themselves. Along with economics and politics, we have seen thecentralisation of media power into Brotherhood hands. They control the world’snews agencies that feed information to newspapers and the broadcast media allover the planet.The Brotherhood media serves the Brotherhood bankers. I have no doubt, either,that intelligence services like the CIA have the technology to use televisionbroadcasts to send subliminal messages into our non-conscious mind, without us,or even the television station concerned, being aware of it. In 1994 a Polishradio station began to send out an inaudible sound on its frequency to clearmosquitos from the homes tuned to that station. It was, apparently, veryeffective in doing so, but thousands of listeners started to complain that itwas also driving their cats mad. If they can do that to insects and cats, theycan do it to humans. What is really coming out of some of the explosion of radioand television stations around the world?I ask this of journalists or the ones who can’t see that they are being used aspropaganda poodles: Are you going to go on meekly serving your masters, or areyou going to rebel? If you only realised what the New World Order has in mindfor you and your media, you would take a very large gulp!And where are the journalists’ unions in all this? I say to them: Get together,open your eyes, and stop cooperating. I cannot tell you how much you will regretit if you don’t. I will be most pleasantly surprised if such a journalisticrebellion does happen but, for now, on past experience, I will not be holding mybreath.In the meantime, we have to provide alternative sources of information, and stopbuying newspapers. The alternatives are emerging in magazines and papersstruggling into life across the world. We also have access to a printing press –the photo copier – to network information through communities and furtherafield. I have found that radio is by far the best means of communicating in themedia as it is today. Newspapers distort by reflex action and television is toooften looking for items so short that it is impossible to communicateeffectively or in depth. I have found that radio offers the time to speak atlength and, if it is live, you are free from editing. What you say is what thelisteners hear. The staple diet of many radio stations is the phone-in and youhave the chance every day to ring up and comment on subjects from theperspective presented in this book and countless others. The awakening isleading to growing interest in subjects like reincarnation, alternative healing,UFOs, and related topics. The media will not be able to resist this interestindefinitely because they will want to use it to increase sales and viewingfigures. That will only further stimulate interest and help to awaken morepeople which, as a result, will speed the demise of the system on which thepresent media depends. In the communities of the future, communication ofinformation will be much more diverse, both in content and control.There will be a revolution in ‘justice’, too. The police-lawyer-jury-judgesystem serves and protects the status quo and it is run by the Brotherhoodsecret societies, especially the Freemasons. One high ranking judge revealed theattitude behind our version of ‘justice’ when he said that people wronglyconvicted by the system should not be released because it undermines publicconfidence in British justice. It takes massive ongoing campaigns over manyyears for those wrongly imprisoned to be released. Some never are. In Britainthere are three people in prison for killing a newspaper boy called CarlBridgewater. A fourth has already died since he was wrongly convicted. I coveredthis case when I worked for BBC Television. They are obviously innocent and theonly reason they are still behind bars is that so many other wrongly convictedpeople have had to be released in the last few years and the authorities don’twant to open the criminal justice system to yet more derision. They want to putas much time as they can between those other high-profile releases and theinevitable release of ‘the Bridgewater Three’. Never mind that this policydemands that three people innocent of the crime for which they were convictedspend even longer in prison. The System comes first.Government ministers and officials who should have no influence in the courts orpublic inquiries meddle as much as they can when certain sentences or decisionswould suit them politically. Some Home Secretaries make known their feelings inthese cases, and this is communicated unofficially down the line and through thefreemasons’ network to the judge. Not every judge takes notice, but many do.It’s good for their career prospects and helps the Brotherhood. It is far fromunknown for a judge to be influenced in his sentencing and decisions by thesecret signs that tell him the defendant or lawyer is a fellow freemason. Whenpublic inquiries are organised to hear objections into road projects thatdevastate communities and the environment, governments make sure an inspectorwho sympathises with their view is appointed to hear the objections and rejectthem. If people only knew what goes on behind the scenes, the robots would haverebelled a long time ago.The winners in this charade of democracy and justice are The System and thelegal profession which is alive with freemasons, as is the police force. It isrun for the professions and the elite, not by a desire for fairness. The costsof going to court to pursue justice have long entered fantasy land. Most peoplehave to concede their rights because they can’t afford to pursue them. Thisgives all the aces to those with money. They can afford to buy their justice.The majority cannot. Even legal aid which is supposed to help the poorest to payfor legal representation is being cut back at every opportunity. Meanwhile theleading lawyers and the judges take home often enormous salaries from a systemthat most people cannot afford to use.I was once involved in a civil case which should never have got to court. Thishappens, however, when one side is willing to negotiate and the other is not.All the costs in the case were awarded against me. Given the circumstances andthe background that was outrageous, but that’s another story. My own legal costswere £1,500. The other side’s costs were estimated in court as about £2,000. Butwhen their final bill arrived from a firm of solicitors in Banbury, Oxfordshire,it had grown miraculously to almost £4,000! My shock at this was made worse whenI read the bill. Only £1,576 of that figure was for work the firm had actuallydone. On top of that they had charged me for not using a barrister. No youdidn’t misread that. I said not using a barrister. It was a straightforward casethat any competent solicitor could have handled and, as I say, there was no needfor a court hearing, anyway. But because they were saying they could have used abarrister had they chosen to, I had to pay for their not doing so. No, I assureyou I am not joking. It is quite within the law for them to do that.Also they charged me extra because I had ‘opposed their application throughout’and because of the ‘importance of the case to our client’. I had to pay and, ineffect, be financially punished by a firm of solicitors because I had challengedtheir demands and because it was an important case for their client. As everyclient considers court hearings to be extremely important to them, they couldapply that added charge to every case they handle. I had to pinch myself tobelieve this was happening, and so did my own lawyer who was as bewildered andappalled as I was. You can appeal to a court against legal bills when costs havebeen awarded against you. It is called taxation. This I did and I was confidentthat the bill was so silly and against all laws of justice and fair play that itwould be reduced and sanity would return. The court did reduce the bill. Theyreduced it by £135 and I was charged £186 for the cost of their doing so!!!It struck me that this was one case in one court on one afternoon involving onefirm of lawyers. Just think what is going on in courts in America and all overthe world. How many people are being cleaned out financially by pursuing theirrights to justice or defending themselves against injustice? It is one of thegreat ironies that members of the legal profession who spend their timeprosecuting or defending illegal theft are themselves responsible day after dayfor legalised theft. The legal system is in the same category as economics,politics, and most of the media. It is sick, corrupt, stupid, juvenile,self-destructing and Brotherhood-controlled. Ask those lawyers who are motivatedby helping people and not by making as much money as possible and they will tellyou the same. I know how frustrated these caring lawyers are at being forced tooperate in such a corrupt and corrupting system. But you see the system has topersuade us that we do have freedom, live in a democracy, and have a fair systemof justice. If it doesn’t maintain that facade, we are more likely to rebel. Itis time we did.Governments do not look honestly and deeply at the causes of crime because to doso would reveal that the ‘values’ necessary for economic growth are the veryvalues that encourage crime and violence. Instead they condemn law breakers,wash their hands of responsibility, and call for harsher punishments. Theprisons are overcrowded because society is punishing the symptoms and notaddressing the cause. And what is the reaction of the growth mentality tocrowded prisons? You got it. Build more prisons. In America which claims to bethe home of freedom, justice, and civilisation, some states still send people tothe electric chair or the firing squad. This is not justice. It is barbarism.Opinion Polls (or rather opinion manipulators) in Britain continually show thatthe majority would bring back hanging for some crimes. What arrogance to thinkwe have the right to take the life of another, and what mental gymnastics itmust require to say that killing is wrong and the state should kill anyone whodoes it!! Expect to see governments trying to introduce more authoritarian lawswhich further erode freedom in all countries as the decade progresses. We mustresist this, peacefully, but with great determination.The changing consciousness will reject the present methods of ‘justice’. Crimewill plummet when new values and measurements of human success are accepted andpersonal achievement is not measured by possessions. The move towards localdecisionmaking and the involvement of all people in the life and direction ofcommunities will reduce negative behaviour still further. The re-linking withour higher levels and all that understanding, love and wisdom, will have thebiggest impact on the reduction of crime and negative behaviour. Before thattime arrives, we need to look at why people act in the negative ways they do.Why have people been so de-humanised that they can mug and maim frail oldladies? The way to change that is not to use the fear of incarceration in somegrotesque prison that will further de-humanise them. It is to treat them in waysthat re-humanise their values and spirit. If someone attacks an old lady, theway to stop them doing it again is to put them, under supervision initially,into situations where they meet and work with old people. This will allow themto see that those they mug are not meaningless, worthless, victims for those ofgreater physical strength. They are human beings with feelings.I see mediation within the community replacing courts and lawyers and ludicrouslegal bills in the decades that follow the turn of the Millennium. The number oflaws will diminish as will the numbers required to administer them. You don’tneed laws to say you must not pollute, when human consciousness has reached alevel that would not dream of harming the Earth in any way. Nor do you need lawsto punish violence when there is no violence, because all life is seen assacred. In the years before that, I believe that more and more awakening peoplewill refuse to cooperate with the economic, political, and legal systems inever-increasing numbers. The system depends on mass subservience andunquestioning cooperation to survive. You can arrest a dozen people for apeaceful protest. You cannot arrest 100,000. Cooperation is the basis of the newworld, but it has to be two-way. One-way cooperation leads only to exploitation.A refusal to cooperate with exploitation will be another way The System willfall.Writing about the themes of the future is difficult because there will bedistinct phases of change. In the short term the breakdown of the old will bringchaos, confusion, and fear. Crime will grow as people grab and steal what thesystem can no longer provide in the old way. The Brotherhood will be encouragingcrime, even stimulating it through its mind-controlling technology, because itwants the public to demand a more authoritarian police force with laws to match.We may see martial law, military coups, and internal conflicts increase aroundthe world. Many will be looking around for someone to blame for this mayhem, andthe encouragement of racial and ethnic prejudice will result. Most human mindshave been programmed to hand over responsibility to others. Amid the confusionof change, they will look to any strong leader to tell them what to do. This isfertile soil for dictators. There will be tensions, sometimes severe, betweenthose serving the status quo and those moving with the frequencies. The way theysee life and what they wish to do will be in conflict. It is up to awakeningpeople to avoid violence in these circumstances. The last thing we need is morenegative energy adding to the extremes we already have. In contrast to thesenegative aspects of the transition, we will see the expansion in positivebehaviour from those following the frequencies. These people will be healingdivisions wherever they can. Old barriers between those of different colours,creeds and ways of life, will be no more among those tuning in. This will be thenew consciousness emerging from the death throes of the old.In the medium term, as The System sinks beneath a tidal wave of change, I feelthe community and regional economies will be stabilising and order will return.By this time, the world population will have fallen rapidly, with more going outof incarnation than coming in. Those who hold out against the frequencies andclose their minds will have left the planet as they fall behind the quickeningvibrations. The level of consciousness that will inherit the Earth will be meek,in that it will not use violence or imposition, but it will be mentally andemotionally strong and wise. When the chaos subsides and calmness returns to theweather, the surface of the Earth, and humanity in general, beings of advancedevolution will arrive in large numbers to assist the development of the newsocieties.Much further into the future, the world will be unrecognisable from the one wesee today and even from that which I envisage for the medium period. Thefrequencies will have risen to levels of knowledge and understanding that willgive humanity the ability to manifest and de-manifest, to travel across spaceand time at will, to create through the power of thought, and to be dependent onnothing except the energy of life itself. By then we will not even require foodas we know it. We will absorb all that we need from the ocean of energy aroundus. Consciously leaving our bodies and experiencing other frequencies will beavailable to everyone whenever they wish. There will be no possession of peopleor objects.Love and respect for everyone and everything will be our guiding light.* The Waco seige was a mass murder by government agencies.

If only we knew how primitive someof those wonders really are.There is such a difference between the ‘science’ we are told about and thatwhich we are not. We have the establishment scientists believing they are at thecutting edge of human understanding while in the secret underground basestechnology exists that would blow their minds. Literally, some of it.Take our sources of energy, as created by the science we are allowed to knowabout. We rape and devastate the Earth collecting oil, gases, and clumps ofmatter. We release the energy held inside them by burning what we havecollected. In doing this we lose much or most of the energy they contain and wecreate horrendous pollution that poisons our air and water and damages ourforests. The alternative is to build blocks of concrete called Nuclear PowerStations. These create waste that is lethal for up to 24,000 years and probablyfar longer. No-one knows what to do with this waste, but we go on producing it.One of the by products is plutonium. One thousandth of a gram of this is fataland if enough gets into the hands of a terrorist or dictator they could make anuclear bomb. Oh yes, and should these power stations leak or explode as withChernobyl, substantial areas of land become uninhabitable and incapable ofsupplying food. Thousands, possibly millions, will die sooner or later fromradiation poisoning or cancer and there’s a good chance that babies born tothose affected will be deformed. And this is called scientific advance? It is,rather, a scientific smokescreen. A deadly one.The Brotherhood, at the highest human level, made a definite decision to supportthe myth that there is no such thing as spirit or an eternal self. It knew thatwasn’t true, but that knowledge was for it, not the people whom it wanted tocontrol. Religion had had its day and humanity was starting to reject its view.This, the Brotherhood decided, could only continue to increase. Another rigidbelief system had to take its place, and anyway, they preferred for people tothink they were nothing but lumps of meat. One of the Brotherhood’s creationswas the famous Royal Society in Britain. It opened its doors in the lateseventeenth century and has been a wonderful vehicle for selling the quitehysterical idea that only the physical world exists. Goodbye God. The media haveonce again played their part like the good lap dogs they have chosen to be andthey still treat the words of a ‘scientist’ as solid gold truth. They arescientists after all, and they are very clever people who know more than we do.I know you don’t understand the jargon, but don’t worry your little head aboutit. You just get on with your life and let the scientists us tell you how thingsare. They know best.What a negative affect this has had on human life. We are back again to the fivesenses. The collective mind of ‘public’ science is convinced that this physicalworld is the only one that exists. They have ridiculed anyone, even members oftheir own profession, who have questioned this and the Brotherhood have arrangedfor much of that onslaught against real scientists. A science in this state ofmisunderstanding will obviously concentrate its research on the world of thefive senses. Its ‘advances’ over the last two hundred years or so have been inunderstanding some of the potential to exploit the physical environment. Fromthe perspective of this physical level it has achieved some remarkable feats. Ithas landed on the Moon (well after the secret scientists did, however),developed endless gadgets, and found ways to treat the symptoms, though lessoften the causes, of some illnesses. But by ignoring or dismissing the existenceof other non-physical levels of people and the planet, it has given itself avery limited and lopsided view of Creation. Sadly it has done the same forbillions of people. Far from advancing understanding, it has held it back byundermining the efforts of the more enlightened scientists and people workingwith psychic sources who challenge the this-is-all-there-is view of life.Say someone goes missing and you organise a search party. You choose not to lookin the area where the person is lost and discourage or prevent anyone else fromlooking there. If anyone does you ridicule and condemn them when they say ‘I’vefound him’. So you don’t find the missing person and in the mind of the searchparty and all the people they influence that person remains lost. By taking yoursearch party to another area you may find other missing people you didn’t knowwere there. You will ‘discover’ many things that will be new to you. But youwon’t find the one you are supposed to be searching for because he is lost inthe area where you refuse to look. If you take the ‘missing person’ to besymbolic of the mysteries of life and the search party to be mainstream science,you have the reason why those so called ‘mysteries’ are still unanswered byscience.Had they not done this and had they had the humility to listen, we would be muchfurther along the road to solving our problems. In fact many of them would nothave been created in the first place. Science is part of the problem when itcould, and should, be part of the solution. If it had not been so obsessed withthe physical world alone or been so arrogant in dismissing alternative thought,we would already have the technology to provide all the power and warmth we needby harnessing the ocean of energy all around us. We would not be destroying theplanet for our heat and light. The knowledge of how to tap into thenon-physical, sub-atomic, energies that surround us is available today, but thescientific establishment and the system in general does not want to know.The reason is that what we call ‘science’ is system-led. It is funded by, andowes its livelihood to, the system and the Brotherhood, which is following itsown agenda. When I wrote It Doesn’t Have To Be Like This, half the world’sscientists were involved in weapons research, and most of the rest wereresearching technologies to serve take, make and throwaway. TheLucifer-controlled system does not want us to know who we are and science hasplayed its role brilliantly. It has denied the existence of our true selves andencouraged us to believe we are just a cosmic accident. People who know they areeternal beings of light and love, on an endless journey of evolution throughexperience, are not so easy to manipulate and control. Science has also been theSystem’s mad professor, producing all the potions, poisons, and technology thathave so affected the planet. The System is based on oil and other fossil fuels,and with the help of science it has managed to protect these energy sources fromthe knowledge that would replace them with non destructive alternatives. I donot wish to decry the achievements that scientists have made in some areas, butthe overall contribution of mainstream ‘public’ science has been to suppresshuman understanding and to use its knowledge for destructive, rather thanconstructive, purposes.The story of science has mirrored that of religion in many ways. Both decided ona creed and belief which they then imposed upon the world and both have soughtto block all efforts to present information and evidence which exposes theirmisunderstandings. But then both are controlled by the same masters who haveensured that both can survive only by suppression. Once they nailed theircolours to the mast and proclaimed one unyielding dogma, their empires, funding,power, and influence have been dependent on the survival of that dogma in theminds of enough people. Suppression of information and understanding becomesessential to their continued existence. If you are a scientist who depends forhis living on the current scientific dogma, the desire to block alternativeexplanations which would shamter that dogma, can be very compelling. The System,no doubt with considerable Brotherhood influence, has ensured that these keyareas like science, politics, economics, the media, and religion must suppresstruth if they are to survive. In suppressing that truth, they must also promotea destructive illusion for the robots to focus on. The media slavishly supportthem by communicating the myth that establishment science is at the cutting edgeof human understanding. I wrote to all the BBC Television science programmessummarising the work of open-minded scientists who are convinced the generalthemes of consciousness and frequencies set out in this book are true. I offeredto put the programmes in touch with these people. I wrote to investigativeprogrammes like ‘World In Action’ with the same information. Only one evenbothered to reply, and that was only to say that in effect they did not covertopics that were not accepted by mainstream science! Game, set, and match tomind control.James Lovelock is one open-minded scientist who has challenged convention. Hehas put forward the theory of ‘Gaia’, the Greek name for the Earth Goddess. Thistheory proposes that the Earth, far from being dead matter, is a living,thinking, organism. I would go much further than Lovelock, but there is a greatdeal of what he says that fits in with the overall themes I am putting forward.In his book The Ages of Gaia he explains why science is system rather thaninformation led:“You may think of the academic scientist as the analogue of the independentartist. In fact, nearly all scientists are employed by some large organisation,such as a governmental department, a university, or a multi-national company.Only rarely are they free to express their science as a personal view. They maythink that they are free, but in reality they are, nearly all of them,employees; they have traded freedom of thought for good working conditions, asteady income, tenure, and a pension. They are also constrained by an army ofbureaucratic forces, from the funding agencies to the health and safetyorganisations. Scientists are also constrained by the tribal rules of disciplineto which they belong. A physicist would find it hard to do chemistry and abiologist would find physics well-nigh impossible to do. To cap it all, inrecent years the ‘purity’ of science is ever more closely guarded by aself-imposed inquisition called ‘the peer review’. This well-meaning but narrowminded nanny of an institution ensures that scientists work according toconventional wisdom and not as curiosity or inspiration moves them. Lackingfreedom they are in danger of succumbing to a finicky gentility or of becoming,like mediaeval theologians, the creatures of dogma.“As a university scientist I would have found it nearly impossible to dofull-time research on the Earth as a living planet. To start with, there wouldbe no funds approved for so speculative a research. If I had persisted andworked in my lunch hour or spare time, it would not have been long before Ireceived a summons from the lab director. In his office I would have been warnedof the dangers to my career of persisting in so unfashionable a research topic.If this did not work and obstinately I persisted, I would have been summoned asecond time and warned that my work endangered the reputation of the department,and the director’s own career.”Control the funding and the lab director and you control what is investigatedand what isn’t. That is what the Brotherhood does. This all-knowing science hasbeen with us for such a short time in human evolution. It is only very recentlythat some of the planets have been ‘discovered’. Neptune was not identifieduntil 1846 and they didn’t know Pluto was there until 1930. There are moreplanets still to find in this solar system, and thousands if not millions ofother such systems across the Universe. If you took the Sun to be the size of anorange, then on that same scale the nearest star outside of this solar systemwould be 3,000 miles away! To think we can pontificate on details about theUniverse and dismiss the idea that there are other universal civilisations isjust beyond belief. Scientific understanding is in its infancy. It is like asmall child forcing its view of the world on everyone else. When you look at its‘big bang’ theory for the Universe, the explosion of a ‘Cosmic Egg’ of matterwhich they say formed the Universe, it is incredibly naive. It is founded oncalculations that other galaxies are speeding away from this one. Theimplication being, conventional thinking believes, that they are still beingforced away by the power of the original explosion. It is a very tenuous hook onwhich to hang a theory that has become accepted by many as ‘fact’. Galaxies aremoving because everything is in orbit. Much of the scientific ‘advancement’ ofthe modern world is merely the confirmation of what the ancients already knew,because space visitors and channelled communicators told them.Science is not as clever as it thinks it is, but far from showing the humilitynecessary for open-minded research, it has consistently dismissed even its ownprofession when they have predicted new possibilities. They don’t understandsomething and so they arrogantly say it cannot happen. An Astronomer Royal saidthat talk of space travel was ‘utter bilge’ just eighteen months before theRussian Sputnik was orbiting the Earth, and that was primitive compared withwhat secret science was doing! As another astronomer, Carl Sagan, once said:“Intellectual capacity is no guarantee against being dead wrong”. If, however,alternative explanations are systematically suppressed everyone else isencouraged to be dead wrong also.But the dyke is collapsing for science as it is for all expressions of TheSystem. From without, the evidence continues to mount through near-deathexperiences and ‘inexplicable’ phenomena, that reveal the limitations ofunderstanding and vision at the core of ‘public’ scientific theory. And fromwithin, the open-minded, genuine, scientists who seek to unlock the mysteries ofCreation are being inspired by the rising consciousness to accept what psychicshave been saying for so long. These twin pressures on scientific dogma willbring current scientific ‘thinking’ and its empire of influence and delusioncrashing down in this decade and the next one.With the genuine scientists now tuning into the higher frequencies, theunderstanding of who we are and the nature of life is awakening in theirconsciousness. This is leading them into areas of inquiry that will unlock themysteries for them. The establishment will try to resist their findings, but itwill make no difference. The laws of physics are going to be re-written. The wayphysics is currently perceived by scientists considered by the public to be‘geniuses’ is in reality well wide of the mark. The supporters of today’s viewof physics have closed their minds to the non-physical levels of existence andignored 99.99 per cent of Creation. No wonder their understanding is so limited.How tragic that scientists like Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, and manyothers had identified the basic answers to many of the mysteries scientificallymuch earlier in this century, but were ignored and attacked by Brotherhoodsupporters, as were the psychics who have known for thousands of years whattoday’s system-serving scientists still don’t know. More than two thousand yearsago the Greek philosophers understood the principles of life and Creation beforeChristianity, Islam and others arrived on the scene.The rising consciousness will sweep away the delusions and present us withtechnology beyond our dreams. There will be no need for fossil fuels,electricity pylons, or even the ‘alternative’ sources like wind and wave power.Each home will have a device, perhaps no bigger than a shoe box, which willharness the Earth’s energy field to provide all the power and warmth we need. Itwill not have to be plugged into a grid. It will work independently anywhere youwish to take it. Transport will be revolutionised and made non-polluting byusing the same understanding. We will have the knowledge to travel through time.Space travel will be like catching a bus today. The idea that we are alone inthe Universe will seem as ludicrous as believing the Earth is flat. Later willcome all the ‘miraculous’ feats like manifesting and de-manifesting, which Ihave already spoken of.How do I know? Because most of it is already happening today, suppressed or insecret, and has been for decades. Free energy is a fact. By that I meantechnologies that provide unlimited supplies of energy without using any fuelthemselves. They access the ocean of power in the Earth’s energy field and otherenergies all around us and produce no pollution and no environmental degradationwhatsoever. You need no coal mines, no oil rigs, no power stations, nuclear orotherwise, and no ugly power lines in a national grid. These technologies can beused to heat and power homes, businesses, vehicles, anything. We talk of the‘electric vehicle’ running on batteries, when the brilliant Croatian scientistNikola Tesla ran a car in New York with a form of free energy technology in1931, and man called John Worrel Keely of Philadelphia demonstrated his‘Dynaspheric Force’ free energy machine in New York in the 1890s! Whileinvestigating the magnetic forces flowing between the Earth’s poles, hediscovered that ‘corpuscles of matter’ could be divided by vibration and theprinciple used to drive a motor.The inventors of free energy technology have always suffered suppression andsome have been harassed in other ways. One, John Searl, from Britain, was jailedfor his trouble. In 1946, when he was only 14, he built his Searl EffectGenerator (SEG) which was inspired by a dream he had as a boy. It was based on amagnetic device, and it generated usable electricity. As he perfected hiscreation, Searl also began to build flying craft using the same power systemwhich could out-perform even today’s conventional air and space craft. Threemonths before he planned to build a craft for a manned flight, he was jailed forusing his own free electricity and not paying the power company to use theirs!While Searl was in prison on this outrageous charge, the authorities burned allhis papers. The same happened to an American inventor, Dennis Lee, whodiscovered The Brotherhood and The System in general is desperate to stop thesetechnologies, because they will remove our dependence for fuel and warmth andthe whole cover-up of their technology will begin to come to light. Many freeenergy inventors are refused patents, and their work can be classified by aninternational ‘Military Use Refuse’ law which can stop them from publishingtheir findings or promoting their technology. But the Brotherhood elite know allabout it, because the information goes to their secret scientists.How appalling to think that while old people shiver from the cold and die fromhypothermia because they can’t afford their heating bills, the ability toproduce limitless energy for free is suppressed to serve the interests of someperverted elite. In Britain, fuel bills have increased enormously after a newtax was added, and people suffer ill health from the pollution caused by thisprimitive burning of fossil fuels. Meanwhile the answer is blocked and has beenfor decades. Where are you politicians? Where are you journalists? Where are youenvironmental groups? Expose this scandal and insist that free energytechnologies are further developed and made available to everyone. The freeenergy technology of the Illuminati elite is further ahead of anything thepublic know about, as it is in other scientific knowledge. How they must smileat what is being taught to students in the schools and universities of the worldunder the title ‘science’.The Brotherhood know that the laws of Creation as set out at the start of thebook are correct. They know about energies and frequencies. It may be a versiontwisted by other misunderstanding, but they know the real laws of physics. I amnot saying this next story is all accurate, some of it may be disinformation,but it will give you some idea of how far ahead Illuminati scientists are of‘Cattle’ scientists.Franklin D Roosevelt was a close friend of Nikola Tesla, the scientific geniuswho was to say that much of his knowledge came from ETs. One of Tesla’sstudents, Guglielmo Marconi, set up a secret group which claimed to have builtflying saucers in the 1940s, and to have landed on the Moon in the early 1950s.Interestingly, a ridiculous number of Marconi scientists and others working insimilar areas have had strange and inexplicable deaths. Roosevelt asked Tesla,some researchers claim, to become the director of a project which is now knownas the Philadelphia Experiment. His number two was Dr John Von Neumann and theteam based themselves at Princeton University before everything was moved to theBrooklyn Naval Yard in 1940 and code named Project Rainbow. The brief was tomake an American ship invisible both to radar and the human eye. They achievedthis with a minesweeper by generating intense magnetic fields. Tesla was given abattleship for his next experiment in 1942, but protested when he learned thatthis time there would be a crew on board. He felt they would be in danger and,it seems certain, he sabotaged the test which didn’t work. Tesla left and tenmonths later he was said to have been found dead in his New York hotel room. VonNeumann took over and on July 20th, 1943, he conducted the experiment again onthe US destroyer escort, ‘The Eldridge’.It worked, but the crew went hysterical and were sick. Von Neumann asked formore time to perfect the technology, but the Chief of Naval Operations insistedit was finished by August 12th, 1943, because they wanted to use this capabilityin the war. He said, however, that he would accept only radar invisibility. Thisthey achieved in Philadelphia Harbor, but then, after a blue flash, the Eldridgephysically disappeared for three hours. Now it gets complicated because we areabout to cross frequencies of time and space. Two young scientists on board,Edward and Duncan Cameron, came on deck to find the crew suffering from extremehysteria and the two of them jumped overboard. The story claims that they didn’tland in water, but in the Montauk Army Base on New York’s Long Island where theyrealised that it was now 1983 – forty years later. Yes, I know it sounds crazy,but stay with me!The general background to the Philadelphia Experiment has been told in a featurefilm, and the basic themes of it are said to be correct. In the undergroundcentre at Montauk the Camerons were taken to see Von Neumann, now of course amuch older man than the one they had known in 1943. Von Neumann was reported tohave died in 1957, but that was part of the cover for his work. He told themthat they had to be transported back in time to the Eldridge in 1943 to smashthe equipment because the experiment had created a ‘bubble in hyperspace’ whichthreatened to cause catastrophe on this frequency. Von Neumann had by now(1983), perfected the technology for time travel thanks to the extra-terrestrialinput since the 1950s, this story claims. The Camerons were transported back tothe ship and 1943 where they smashed the equipment. When that happened, theEldridge reappeared physically. See, I said it was complicated, and it’s evenmore so when you read the full story as documented in other books. It is hard tocomprehend all this if we remain stuck with our version of time rather than aversion in which the past, present and projected future are happening together.Perhaps most amusing was the fact that when Cameron, back in 1943, told VonNeumann what had happened to him in 1983, his boss refused to believe him!Again I say that I am not suggesting that I believe every word of this. I don’tknow. There are some amazing stories coming out, but I do believe that at leastthe Illuminati scientists are working in these sort of areas, includinginter-frequency and, possibly, time travel.It is said that when the Eldridge returned to the physical world of 1943, it wasa nightmare to behold. The time-space-molecular synchronisation had been soscrambled by what happened that many of the crew members were found to be partof the superstructure of the ship. Others were insane and still others woulddisappear or burst into flames. Talk about cleverness without wisdom. The madprofessors are out of control. The researchers making these claims say theproject was stopped after the Eldridge disaster and Von Neumann went to LosAlamos to work on the development of the atomic bomb. But by 1947 curiosity, andthe potential for power presented by what had been learned in the PhiladelphiaExperiment got the better of them. It was re-started under Von Neumann asProject Phoenix at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in New York. He alsoworked with the recovery of the crashed spacecraft and extra-terrestrials, likethe one near Roswell. Some researchers say that a number of craft weredeliberately brought down by the American military when they realised how theycould be seriously destabilised. Von Neumann and Dr. Vannevar Bush were two whoworked with the extra-terrestrial from the Roswell crash known as EBE, it issuggested.The development of Project Phoenix into the 1980s has, some claim, produced theknowledge and technology to travel through time. One story says they havetravelled forward in time, but when they reach 2011 everything enters adream-like state. 2011 links in with the predictions of the Maya and others forthe time of great change. There is so much speculation that looking at thethemes rather than all of the detail, claim and counter-claim, is probably farmore productive. It is further said that Von Neumann and the secret scientistshave also perfected the technique of making a person older or younger bybreaking their ‘time lock’. Tesla was working on time locks before he died, ordisappeared. We are time-locked at birth into this frequency’s version of time.On physical death, the time lock breaks and we are free to move on to otherspace-time worlds. Without this time lock during a physical life it would bechaos, and the sort of things that happened to the crew of the Eldridge would behappening to all of us. But if you can remove the time lock in a controlled way,you can advance or regress the age of the physical body, or so someinvestigators have said. The Brotherhood elite know how to change the weather ina limited way, and from the grotesque experiments they carry out on theirabducted victims these insane scientists also know how to create clones. Some ofthe ‘little greys’ which people often report seeing could be from theirlaboratory and I’m sure they have developed the ability to create a human body,Frankenstein-style. To think we are having discussions about the morality ofgenetic engineering while this is going on! Thousands of people go missing inthe world every year and are never seen again. A number of them, I have nodoubt, end up in the underground laboratories.Their understanding of anti-gravity technology – spacecraft – is now veryadvanced and many of the UFO sightings we hear about will be craft being testedand flown by human pilots. The bright light or glow around a UFO as reported byso many people is caused by the magnetic field produced by the craft whichaffects the gravitation field to create anti-gravity. There are many differenttechnologies that these craft use to harness the natural energy fields.Think what such knowledge could do in positive hands. It could bring an end topoverty, suffering and environmental degradation. We could be travelling fromBritain to Germany in five minutes, Britain to Australia in half an hour orless. Leaving today’s destructive insanity behind will not mean poverty foreveryone, as the present system collapses. We have the choice to have a lifemade easier by amazing, non-destructive, technology that will dump poverty,hunger and homelessness into the dustbin of history where it belongs. This wewill do because these misguided men are not going to win. The transformation,with help from all levels, is going to remove their manipulation, and they willhave to wait for another opportunity to work out their vast imbalances. Theywill do their damndest to cause havoc over the next twenty years or so, buttheir control of this planet is coming to its conclusion.There needs to be a rebellion of science students – all students – in everyuniversity, each coordinating with the others. They can demand to know whatknowledge is really available and reject the rubbish they are being spoon-fed tokeep them in the dark. The same with their lecturers, most of whom don’t knowwhat is going on either. Come on, get moving my friends. There is no time tolose. Don’t take no for an answer. Do it peacefully and with love, but ensure itis underpinned by unbreakable determination. The robots can choose to rebel. Ifthey don’t they will regret it forever and a day.Medical students and other health employees can do the same. The way peoplesuffer when there is no need is one of the greatest scandals of this story. Asthe transformation progresses, other methods of healing will bring an end to thedrug-obsessed, surgery-obsessed, disease care services of today. Once againmedical science has been directed to see only the physical level of being. Ittreats symptoms and not causes, because it does not understand the causes. Howcan it when most illness results from imbalances on our non-physical levels andmedical science insists those levels don’t exist? It is known that people wholive under or near power lines or have close contact with electromagnetictechnology are more prone to certain illnesses, particularly some cancers. Humanscience has no idea why this should be. But our non-physical self is a series ofelectromagnetic energy fields working as one. When we come into close andconsistent contact with other powerful electromagnetic fields thrown out bypower lines and technology, our subtle selves are affected in various ways. Thisimbalance distorts the etheric body which governs the workings of the physical.In turn the etheric organisation is disrupted and the physical becomesimbalanced, resulting in cancer or another dis-ease. That is why the crew of theEldridge was so affected on all levels by the immense electromagnetic field theywere subjected to.Even illness is used to serve the system. The Brotherhood-owned or -controlleddrug companies fund scientific research, and insist that the scientists they arefunding look only for ways of treating disease through drugs or technology thatcan be bought and sold. The world is awash with tablets and potions, and thedrug companies measure their profits in billions. Some of their gross mark-upsare as high as 90%. But the disease-care services are submerged by people whoare ill! When I was younger I had a doctor who hardly lifted his head longenough to look at me before he was writing a prescription for some drug orother. Representatives from the drug companies have many ways to ‘encourage’doctors to use their products. So many people are ill, physically oremotionally, that the disease-care services are little more than conveyor beltscutting open and administering drugs to the never-ending stream ofsystem-created disease that is passing by. The doctors and nurses are as muchthe victims as the patients. For doctors and nurses, see economists,politicians, scientists and journalists. They are programmed to think TheSystem’s way and do its bidding within the prison of misunderstanding it buildsaround them. But again many are awakening from this slumber.Nothing sums up better the conveyor belt mentality of medical care than acircular sent out by a doctors’ practice on the Isle of Wight. It said thatpatients were reminded that doctors’ appointments were for five minutes only andthis was not the time to discuss other problems. There you have it in asentence. The fact that the ‘other problems’ were likely to be the cause oftheir illness did not seem to register. If there are imbalances in our eternalselves, especially at the emotional level, they will filter down through thechakra system to manifest as physical disease or disease. Medical science reactsby throwing drugs at the symptoms while ignoring the cause. It accepts thatstress and emotional problems can cause illness because the evidence isoverwhelming. But it rejects any idea of eternal consciousness and so it cannotunderstand why stress causes disease. When they identify an emotional problemthey prescribe Valium or other anti-depressants in an attempt to suppress thesymptoms. What the patient really needs is for the cause of their depression tobe addressed. If you are depressed because you have poor housing you don’t needdrugs, you need a decent house. But instead of being a health service, thesystem has turned doctors and nurses into medical garbage collectors, copingwith the human debris the system daily tips out. I am not condemning doctors oranyone in the medical profession. What else can they do when their workload issuch that they can give no more than five minutes to a patient and have no powerto provide what the patient really needs to remove their dis-ease?Preventative medicine which removes the causes of dis-ease before they becomephysical problems is largely ignored by the medical establishment, because to dowhat is necessary would mean re-thinking all its values and misguidedprinciples. Instead, even preventing illness – or claiming to – is used to stokethe fires of financial opportunism and exploitation. Did you know that thefluorides added to drinking water in the name of fighting tooth decay were usedas rat poison for nearly 40 years?Since the early 1900s industrial fluorines have been a major polluter of riversand streams, poisoning land and animals. They are a by-product of the aluminiumindustry. In 1939 the Mellon Institute in the USA asked Dr Gerald Cox to find amarket for fluoride waste. Cox, a biochemist, suggested the idea of putting themin the public drinking water. This delighted his paymasters, the MellonInstitute, because it was owned by the family of Andrew Mellon, the owner of theAluminum Corporation of America (ALCOA). In 1944, Oscar Ewing was employed byALCOA at an annual salary of $750,000, and this was fifty years ago! Withinmonths he had moved on to be the head of the Federal Security Agency and hebegan a campaign to have fluoride added to public water supplies. By 1951, hehad persuaded Congress that it was a good idea and was given two million dollarsto start the work. You could not put this rat poison into rivers and streamsbecause it was considered too dangerous, but you could put it into water thatpeople drank. This was great for ALCOA, but terrible for the people, and thissort of covert wheeler-dealing is going on behind the politician-speak everyday. Interestingly, flouride has been shown to dull the intellect.This is dream land for drug companies. It is no surprise that one drug companyalone I saw increased its six monthly profits by 1.7 billion dollars. This addsgreatly to the wealth of people like the Rockefellers who own half thepharmaceutical industry in the USA, according to Nexus magazine. But suchincreases in profits have run parallel to the growth in drug-related illness. DrBrian Strom, Associate Director of Medicine and Pharmacology at the Universityof Pennsylvania School of Medicine, estimates that the side effects from drugskill 160,000 Americans every year, and put 1.6 million into hospital. I’ve seenpeople I know prescribed pills for symptoms, and others to offset the effects ofthem. This is making the tills ring even quicker for the drug companies. Ifmedical science does not understand the true nature of the human being, how canit avoid creating drugs that cause more harm than the original illness they aredesigned to treat? But then a drugged-up population is just what the Brotherhoodwants. And how do we know what they are putting in those drugs?The drug companies are terrified of alternatives to this madness. They portrayalternative healers as ‘quacks’ who are potentially dangerous when they,themselves, are often lethal. There are people who call themselves alternativehealers who are nothing of the kind and you have to be careful. But I don’tremember an alternative healer coming up with Thalidomide which deformed so manybabies; nor do I recall them giving people drugs with side effects that ensuretheir victims will never be able to walk out in the sunshine again. Drugcompanies have done both and much more. Just as the oil companies and theBrotherhood seek to stop free energy technology, so the Brotherhood drugcompanies make every effort to discredit and destroy all cures that do notinvolve drugs. They don’t want a cure for cancer. They are making too much moneyselling drugs to treat the symptoms of it. This is not about health. It is aboutwealth.The Pharmaceutical Industry is one of the most corrupt and corruptingorganisations humanity has invented. It is Brotherhood-controlled and one of themost sinister of its operations. Ian Sinclair, in his book You can overcomeAsthma says that in 1972, a commission set up by the Chilean President, SalvadorAllende (a doctor), reported that no more than two dozen drugs were actuallyeffective. The doctors on the commission proposed a dramatic reduction in drugspurchased from the companies, mostly American. Within a year, the junta with CIAsupport, had ousted Allende in a coup. The doctors on the commission werekilled, and the new regime recommenced business as usual with the drugcompanies. The industry controls the whole system – doctors, universities,research, government, health departments, the lot. And when they are preventedfrom marketing drugs which are exposed as dangerous, they dump them on the ThirdWorld. So, everyone involved in medicine, are you going to continue to take allthis, or are you going to get together and do something?AIDS is a massive earner for the drug industry. They even leak claims about‘cures’ to boost their share price as people invest in a company in the hopethat they will make lots of money when the ‘cure’ is marketed. They do this withother ‘cures’ too, and the media poodle barks to its master’s tune again byrunning stories of drug research projects on the verge of this or that‘breakthrough’ which never sees the light of day. AIDS, this heaven-sentprofits-booster for the drug companies, is not some mysterious disease that hascome from nowhere. It was almost certainly created in a laboratory. I have seensome evidence presented by Robert Strecker MD that AIDS is basically caused bythe amalgamation of two animal diseases – bovine leukemia in cattle and visnavirus which affects sheep.Dr Strecker says that, the genes of the AIDS-causing virus do not exist inprimates or humans. But they do exist in these two viruses, known asretro-viruses, in cattle and sheep. During hearings of the Church Committee in1969 it was learned that the Department of Defence had asked for ten milliondollars to create new viruses to destroy the immune system. In 1972 the Bulletinof the World Health Organisation (part of the UN) carried suggestions from agroup of virologists that a virus be made to destroy the T-cell and B-cellsystems of human beings. The idea was, it appears, that if they could make avirus to cause cancers and leukemia, it would help them to find a cure for thosediseases. Strecker’s research leads him to believe that the bovine leukemia andvisna virus were mixed in the laboratory to create the bovine-visna virus. Thiswas then grown in human tissue, which turned it into a virus that affected thehuman body in a way that dismantled the immune system. We call it AIDS.The authorities denied this, and even denied the existence of the cattle-sheepvirus combination known as the bovine-visna virus, but Dr Strecker tracked downpapers detailing this very thing. He says:“(Bovine-visna virus) had the exact same shape as the AIDS virus; it had thesame molecular weight; it had the exact same genetic structure in a sense; ithad the exact same Magnesium dependency, which is relatively unique in thisclass of agents. It had the exact same capability of killing T-cells selectivelyand yet, in the cumulative knowledge of the world’s AIDS experts, this virusdidn’t exist. Now that’s a lie.“What we think happened was that…in 1972 we produced a group of viruses thatwill cause cancer in the laboratories around the world and then, in our opinion,these viruses were probably tested. We think they were tested in largepopulations in Africa, which explains how you get three hundred million Africansprobably infected today……The epidemic in Africa would not have started from asingle-point infection. In other words, the numbers infected are so great thatthere had to be a mass inoculation at some point in the mid-1970s. What we thinkreally happened was a group of scientists went to Africa and actually testedthese agents there.” (In the guise of smallpox vacinations).It is also interesting that, according to Dr Strecker, the initial spread ofAIDS in the United States tallies exactly with a US Government vaccine study onHepatitis B which involved young, white male homosexuals between the ages oftwenty and forty. AIDS appeared where the Hepatitis vaccine study had been – NewYork, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and St. Louis. If you believe that noone would ever do such a thing, that’s because you run your life with standardsthat are far higher than the misguided people who run the world. When you thinkthat many countries have tested nuclear bombs without evacuating either theirsoldiers or the local population, because they want to study the effects on thehuman body, it is clear how much respect some of these characters have for humanlife. Poisons and radiation have been released purposely into local populationsaround the world for studies on the effects. Germ warfare testing has beenconducted in this way. One of the projects which have done this in the UnitedStates was called MK-ULTRA which I spoke of in an earlier chapter. RobertStrecker says that in Alabama, they recruited black men in the 1930s for along-term study on the progression of syphilis, and when penicillin came alongthey prevented the men from being cured, because they considered the study moreimportant. The same mentality, and worse, goes on in the scientific communitytoday among the extremists. That Alabama study, incidentally, was conducted bythe US Public Health Service Department which today works out of Atlanta,Georgia, under the title of The Center for Disease Control, and it ‘leads’ thegovernment battle against AIDS. I feel that the cure for AIDS is already known.I don’t know if all Dr Strecker’s assumptions are correct, but he makes sometelling points and I feel sure that AIDS has its origin in a laboratory. One ofthe themes running through the findings of the researchers into the New WorldOrder is that there is a secret plan to reduce the global population bygenocide, and that includes attempts to use diseases like AIDS and germ warfaretechniques. As I say, these are strange people under the influence of a verymisguided force. What is it that the Protocols say? They would underminehumanity in part by “the inoculation of diseases”.The idea of reducing the population through the spread of disease is believed tohave originated from a meeting of scientists in 1957, who came to the conclusionthat the soaring population, pollution and the exploitation of the environmentwould destroy the planet’s life support systems by the year 2000. Eisenhowerordered a study to be conducted into alternative ways of responding to thiscrisis. Alternative One was to use nuclear devices to blast holes in thestratosphere to allow heat and pollution to escape, and change the destructivehuman culture into one of environmental protection (this was rejected).Alternative Two was to construct underground cities, connected by tunnels, whereselected representatives of the various cultures would continue the human race.Alternative Three was for the chosen few to move to new bases on the Moon andother planets. The Moon was code-named ‘Adam’ for this plan, and Mars was ‘Eve’.All three alternatives include the release of deadly diseases, and AIDS is saidto be one of them. I cannot confirm any of this, and I don’t present it as fact,but what is obvious is that we have not even begun to know the full story aboutAIDS. One body of opinion suggests that the HIV virus, which is said to causeAIDS, is not the culprit, or not the only one, and I believe that theelectromagnetic pollution produced by the military and secret services isharming the human immune system.The cure for AIDS and other human diseases lies in the areas termed alternativemedicine. I am particularly impressed with vibrational medicine and the use ofsound to re-balance and re-harmonise the mind, body and spirit. I said beforethat every vibration has its own sound, shade of colour, symbol and number, andif you can use these to harmonise the body and the human energy field, dis-easeis replaced by health. The sound which represents the vibration of harmony forthe Earth is the ‘OM’ sound and its colour is white, the amalgamation of allcolours. The ancients knew of this. The symbol of the OM vibration is the threespirals which together form a triangle. It can be found on countless ancientsites, stones and caves. This knowledge is now resurfacing in our consciousness,and it will revolutionise healing.Alternatives like acupuncture, homeopathy, rieki, radionics, aromatherapy,reflexology, and others reflect a far wider understanding of the human being.They seek to remove the imbalances on all levels and treat the cause, not thesymptom. Preferably, they wish to identify potential trouble and re-balance theenergy fields before any physical discomfort is felt. Acupuncture, which isthousands of years older than the drug companies, uses needles to balance outthe energy flows through the chakras and the lines of energy known as meridians.Hands-on healing of the genuine kind is not ‘faith healing’; it is the transferof energies from the healer through their hands to the patient. A form ofphotography developed by a Russian couple called Kirlian can photograph theenergy fields around the body. They found that when they photographed someonewith an illness the energy fields were weak. When they photographed healers, theenergies were particularly vivid and bright. After a healing session, thepatient’s energies were stronger and the healers had temporarily diminished.Everyone has the potential to heal to some level depending on what they havechosen to do in this life. In the next few years, millions are going to realisethat they have come to the Earth to be healers, because that is going to bevital during the transition.The evolution of healing is another example of why the system has to collapse ifreal change is to be realised. The growth in alternative healing has beenhastened by the breakdown of the disease-care services like the National HealthService in Britain. That is constantly short of funds because the system isunable to produce the money from take, make and throw away to cope with thegrowth in human dis-ease caused by over-consumption; and when a health serviceis dependent on drug-based treatments and expensive surgery, it will never haveenough money for all it needs to do. The demise of the economic system isencouraging people to look for alternatives like barter, and it is the same withhealing. The disease services are falling apart and people are turning toalternatives far more rapidly than they would otherwise have done. The changesin consciousness will speed this process every year, until we see a fusionbetween the knowledge of the physical level as expressed by today’s doctors, andthe understanding of the higher levels which alternative methods possess. I donot see this fusion as a 50-50 balance. Nothing like. The alternative methodswill become the overwhelming foundations of health care, and other even moreeffective methods will be developed as higher knowledge becomes available to usand we can control the aging process and remove genetic disease byre-programming the DNA genetic coding. The cut ’em and drug ’em days are almostover.We will see that the physical body is a far more fantastic creation than sciencehas yet understood and the basis of all health and illness is thought. Ouretheric energy fields organise the physical body as I have already said and itencodes every single cell with a memory of what it is and what it has to do. Acell is a classic example of the universal principal of as above, so below. Eachone is, in its energy system and memory, a smaller version of the whole body.Our thoughts are constantly affecting this process positively and negatively.Everything that happens to us which affects our thoughts is affecting the DNAgenetic coding which we pass on to our children, or, to be more accurate, thephysical bodies we create for the consciousness of our children. We can getgenetic illness because of an emotional trauma or physical accident whichsomeone experienced in the same genetic line thousands of years ago. The affectof the emotions on the etheric organisation is passed through to the DNA and ondown the line until the DNA is ‘wiped’ clean of that inherited geneticimbalance. This can be done very quickly and simply in a few minutes once youknow how, and long-standing illnesses disappear after such treatment. It doesnot involve a single drug or any surgery whatsoever. As this gains acceptanceyou will not be able to give away shares in the drug companies and conventionalmedicine. We are obviously very much affected by the genetic history of theancestral line of our genetic spacesuits and people are dying every day, everyminute of every day come to that, for the want of a simple treatment that canremove the genetic inheritances that all bodies carry. What we do and what weexperience emotionally and physically in this life is passed on to our children.Once this DNA cleansing is widely accepted, expectant mothers and would-befathers will go through this process to ensure that they are passing on onlypositive genetic codes to their children. The emotional state of the motherduring pregnancy has a very big effect on the children, because the baby in thewomb is linked to the mother’s blood supply and its growing form is affectedgenetically by what she is experiencing emotionally. Healers in this field ofVibrational Medicine and genetic cleansing are years ahead of medical science aswe have come to know it. Watch the drug companies try to marginalise and outlawalternatives to their empires of greed as the years progress. They are alreadydoing so, and we should respond to this in the usual way – by ignoring them andany laws that might arise from their lobbying.The expansion of healing and healers cannot happen too fast. Some diseases willdisappear with the rising consciousness, while new ones will develop, some ofthem from the effect of the quickening vibrations on those who choose to closetheir minds to change. The vibratory disharmony between those people and theconsciousness of the planet will have many consequences for mental, emotional,and physical well-being. The more people who have activated their healing gifts,the better it will be for everyone. This need will be compounded by theconsequences of administering drugs like sweets. I wrote in It Doesn’t Have ToBe Like This of the danger from ‘Superbugs’. These are viruses that havedeveloped immunity to drugs like antibiotics which have been prescribed foralmost anything that moves. We are now seeing these Superbugs and I feel thatsome diseases we thought had gone forever will start to return. Superbugs,incidentally, have implications for food production. Drug-infested farmingmethods are giving insects immunity to the poisons sprayed on the crops.On the other side of the transition our knowledge will be such that we will liveon this physical level for hundreds of years if we wish, just as we did inLemuria and Atlantis. We will hear stories of a time on Earth when people saidthat only the physical world existed; we will be told of a civilisation soprimitive that they ravaged the planet for fuels, cut open their bodies, andused potions that caused as much illness as they cured. We will smile at thestory tellers. We will shake our heads. And we will find it so hard to believe."},{"pageContent":"18Bricks in the WallLET me offer you a definition of the word education as expressed in schools anduniversities across the world: To teach, instruct, and imbue with a doctrine,idea or opinion.The Oxford English Dictionary would not agree because that it is the definitionit gives for the word ‘indoctrinate’. But, to me, that is a perfect descriptionof humanity’s version of education. Our children are not educated. They areindoctrinated – ’imbued with a doctrine, idea, or opinion’.This is essential to the process of conditioning that we are subjected tothroughout our lives. Education for the young is a wonderful concept ifeducation is what it really is. But The System largely controls what childrenare taught, how they are taught, and what it wishes them to believe. What betterway to condition your population than to have control of what young people aretaught through their formative years? And from what we have seen of the systemin all its glory, do you think this control is going to be used for the good ofthe children or the good of The System? Education, at least in its Western mode,is there to turn out system fodder.It fills young and potentially creative minds with streams of boring, irrelevantand often inaccurate information; with complex mathematical equations mostpeople will never use; and with a view of history that puts the State in thebest possible light. A Texan lady told me how she was taught history. First, along time was spent making the class feel good about being Texan. They were notonly the best people in America, they were the best in the world. Once that wasestablished, the genocide of the Indians by the white settlers was glossed overand rushed through in a ridiculously short time. You would have thought, shesaid, that only in the 20th century did American history really start. What youwould call ‘education’ is part of the Brotherhood war on the young:“We have got our hands into the administration of the law, into the conduct ofelections, into the press, into the liberty of the person, but principally intoeducation and training as being the corner-stones of a free existence. We havefooled, bemused, and corrupted the youth of the Goyim by rearing them inprincipals and theories which are known to us to be false although it is by usthat they have been inculcated.” (Illuminati Protocol 10).I have been saddened on my many visits to universities to see young people intheir teens who do not have a thought in their head that someone else has notput there. They stand before you after only 17 or 18 years on the planet and arealready mindlessly parroting The System’s propaganda. Another robot reportingfor duty. I was amazed to be told in all seriousness by a student at theprestigious Cambridge University that if you don’t eat meat you die! The factthat I was standing in front of her fit and well after many years as avegetarian had no effect on her conviction that refusing to eat dead animals wasthe equivalent of suicide.You can understand how indoctrination can take hold so quickly. The further youprogress within the education system the more opportunity there is to controlyour thinking. Some of the most enlightened people I have met left school asearly as they could and had not been to university. Enlightenment comes byexpanding your consciousness and accessing higher levels of knowledge. Mostconventional education closes minds and focuses them on this physical worldalone. The campaigner, Michael Roll, makes this point in his booklet TheSuppression of Knowledge. He was referring here to those in high places withinthe system, but the principles apply to everyone and everything, be it religion,science, or economics:“If a baby from birth is told by loving parents that 2 + 2 = 3; and later atSunday school, kindergarten, preparatory school, public school, and universitythis young mind is again told by apparently clever and often highly respectedteachers that 2 + 2 = 3; and if this same teaching comes through the mass media,backed by the weight of law, is it any wonder that many people, often in veryresponsible positions, seriously believe that 2 + 2 = 3?”The System is geared to the setting and passing of examinations. Thisimmediately creates ‘successes’ (those with the ability to absorb and remembermostly irrelevant and inaccurate information) and ‘failures’ (those who do nothave that ability or are too bored to use it). The ‘successes’ go on touniversity to absorb yet more irrelevant and inaccurate information and the‘failures’ go off to look for jobs that are more likely to be given to the‘successes.’ What a way to start your life, be you a success or failure.I was a failure under that definition. I was bored stiff at school. I could notsee how most of the tidal wave of information I was being forced to listen today after day could have any relevance to my future life. I also had theunderlying feeling that most of what I was being told was baloney anyway. I wastalked at by the teachers and rarely consulted for my view or asked to expresscreativity. I never passed an exam and I left school at the first opportunity tobecome a professional soccer player. All my education in its true sense hashappened since. I enjoyed school for the sport and my friends. I liked most ofthe teachers, too, because they were very nice people. But the lessons andexaminations were something I had to endure in order to play soccer and be withmy mates.I can see why The System loves examinations. They are an excellent way of makingchildren and young people absorb the system’s view. There is little margin forpersonal opinion. If you are going to pass you must tell the status quo what itwants to hear. Who sets the questions in exams? The status quo. Who decides whatthe answers must be if you are going to pass? The status quo. Whatever is theconventional wisdom of the day provides the criteria under which you pass orfail. A few centuries ago you would have failed your exam if you had said theEarth was round!Like all aspects of The System, education is in desperate trouble. Its role isto produce robots to fill the jobs the system requires them to do and tocondition out of young people any idea of rebellion against the status quo. TheSystem does not evolve to encompass the gifts and creativity of people; peoplehave to be conditioned and prepared to fit the system. People blindly acceptedthat while take-make-and-throwaway could employ the robots, most accepted thatyou went to school to be prepared for work and then you worked in a trade untilyou retired or died. But now that is no longer happening in the same way.Millions of young people can see no prospect of a job at the end of the line.Even the ‘successes’, the university graduates, are struggling to findemployment. A feeling of ‘what’s the point?’ is growing. Truancy is mostlycaused through boredom and a lack of self worth and involvement at school.Everyone, but everyone, has latent creativity and gifts they have come to offerthe world. Human education is only seriously interested in the gifts that fitThe System and that leaves out a terrific number of alienated people.Within this perversion of the word education are a number of enlightenedteachers and, to a lesser extent in my experience, university lecturers. They dothe best they can to lessen the indoctrination. There are schools which try totap the full potential of their students. But, like the doctors, nurses,politicians, journalists, economists and scientists who are opening theirconsciousness to greater understanding, teachers and lecturers are subject tosevere limitations of action by the structure and control they have to endure.As the demise of take-make-and-throwaway quickens we are hearing governmentministers talking of a ‘return to basics’ in all things. This is their way offinding some illusion of security in a mythical 1950s utopia in which everyonehad their place and everyone knew what it was. This back to basics policy whenapplied to education, puts an emphasis on ‘talking at’ teaching, an expansion oftests and exams and, to quote one former Education Secretary, a return toteaching a fear of God. Give me strength.I see a very different approach surfacing as consciousness expands itsunderstanding of life. Like everything I have discussed in this book, thetransition period for education will be one of opposites. The status quo andthose who support it will try to hold back change by returning to ‘basics’ asthey call them. They will wish to make education even more rigid and impose moredogma as a reaction to changes that will eventually sweep it away. Against thatwill be a growing demand from awakening people for education to replaceindoctrination.There are things we all need to learn in our early years, like how to count,write, and communicate. We also require a summary of the ideas that claim toexplain what is happening around us. But, like history, these need to bepresented as ideas, opinions and views, not facts, unless they can be shown tobe so. You only have to read government papers which are released thirty yearsafter events to see how the state re-writes history every day – look at theinformation in this book! Secret Illuminati documents which have come to lightsay that it has rewritten history to suit its own ends. To present all but theoutlines of history as fact is to mislead. Children in the United States werebrought up to believe the Indians were backward savages. When those childrengrew up, many treated the Indians appallingly from that indoctrinatedperspective. British children are taught by law in the schools that theChristian story is historical fact, not a story that Christians choose tobelieve. I was never told at school about Constantine’s Council of Nicaea, theJesus-style saviour figures of the pre-Christians, or the ‘crusade’ against theCathars. Nor are my children. Every Christmas, pupils in primary schools performnativity plays. That’s fine if the story of the Nativity is portrayed as art,the acting-out of a Christian belief. But it isn’t. It’s mostly presented to thechildren as history.I am looking forward to an education which teaches written and verbalcommunication, the mathematics we will need in our everyday lives, and theinformation that will help young people to have a wide understanding of theworld. They need to be given access to all views and to be encouraged to havetheir own opinions. In the teaching of religion, for example, the course wouldinclude explanations of what all religions believe and why. There would be noimposition of one Christian, Muslim, or Jewish dogma. Explanations of karma,reincarnation, and Earth energies would be added to the curriculum along withthe principles of astrology and alternative forms of healing to allow childrenand students the opportunity to have access to all views, not only those whichthe status quo wants us to believe.Education of the future will encourage self-reliance. The basic skills peopleneed to live without dependence on The System will be at the heart of this. Howto grow food, cook, build a house, repair and maintain a home and its contentsand the other skills necessary to be independent. This gives young peoplechoices throughout their lives. The education system of today is teaching moreand more about less and less. It is producing people who are dependent onearning money from one specialised skill to pay for all the other things theyneed. This is the opposite of independence. And look at the consequences whenthat skill is no longer required by take-make-and-throwaway. But making peopledependent serves The System magnificently.The main motivation of the new education will be to identify and encourage thegifts the student has brought into incarnation. The students themselves willdecide this. Ask young people what they most enjoy and you will invariably belooking at their natural potential. We reveal our gifts in our enthusiasms andinterests. Many young people who are less than ‘successful’ at school will bedoing some marvellous things in their spare time when they are in control ofwhat they can and cannot do. I have known people who were regarded as failuresat maths at school but who can work out the odds and pay-outs for a horse raceat lightning speed. This is possible because the maths involved – in this casewhen applied to horse racing – has become part of their enthusiasm. You may notagree with horse racing or betting, but that’s another subject. The point I ammaking is that, if you encourage people’s enthusiasms and use those as a basisfor teaching other skills, you are going to be very much more successful than ifyou only talk at them from the front of the class or tell them to read textbooks.The new education will not concentrate on the skills demanded by throughput.There will be greater opportunities to develop gifts in the arts, crafts andsport. With everyone’s gifts encouraged, there will be no ‘failures’. Youngsterswill not be leaving school thinking they have failed because the examinationresults say so. Once the basic diversity of knowledge has been taught, theopportunities will be there to specialise and develop to a level of excellencewhatever the student has decided he or she wishes to do. But this will happenwith the wide range of skills and understanding underpinning that specialisationand the choices they offer, always available.Respect and love for the Earth and all life will be encouraged throughout thenew education. From an early age, children will spend time, as part of theircurriculum, working in the community with old people, the infirm and those inneed for whatever reason. Loving and caring for each other will be the guidingprinciples of education. Professional teachers won’t be the only vehicles foreducating the young. In every community there are thousands of people withskills and knowledge which would benefit students. But, instead of using thatwealth of knowledge, The System relies on teachers and lecturers alone to giveinsights into subjects for which they often have no practical experience. Thereneeds to be a better balance between the teachers’ classroom skills and thepractical experience of others in the community.It is time for the teaching profession to rebel and refuse to serve this systemof indoctrination any longer. They are just being used by those in control tofeed the children in their care the information The System wants them to hearand believe. Come on teachers and teachers’ unions. Refuse to be used as systemfodder programmed to turn out more fodder to replace you. Stop cooperating, SayNo. The same applies to parents. Insist on real education. Stop cooperating withthe programming of your children. The circle must be broken.During the transition period, I expect more people to take their children out ofthe state system. They will either teach them at home or get together in groupsto form their own schools. These will not be giant comprehensives. They will bemuch smaller and more personal. A typical one could be composed of just a fewfamilies getting together. Far less of a student’s day will be spent sitting andbeing talked at; far more in doing and talking themselves. The move away fromformal state education will increase through this decade and across theMillennium. Economic collapse will add further to the demise of the presenteducation system. Further in the future, the whole concept of education will beunrecognisable when compared to what we have today or even to the new approachto learning which I have been promoting.We need to appreciate that going through the state education indoctrinationmachine and coming out with examination passes and letters after your name doesnot, in itself, make you intelligent, wise or inspired. It can actually suppressall three. While I was writing this chapter I saw a ‘highly-qualified’ scientistgiving a television lecture about the new frontiers of science. At the end heposed a number of questions which he said science will need to answer about themysteries of life. People without his paper qualifications have been answeringthose questions since before he was born, but The System has not listened. Inthe next twenty years, it will be shown, even to the satisfaction of mainstreamthinking, that the themes in this book and others about life and Creation arecorrect. The media could have printed these answers years ago, but they ignoredthem because I and people like me do not have letters after our name or have ourexplanations pored over in scientific journals. Nor are we supporters of thestatus quo. The education system of today doesn’t just indoctrinate thepopulation during their time at school and university. It decides throughout ourlives who we should listen to and who we should not, especially when science isinvolved.Yet, if you can access higher levels of consciousness, you can bring into thisworld understandings and knowledge that are light years ahead of human science,the bulk of which is only interested in the physical world. Coming intoincarnation now through many of our babies are aspects of universalconsciousness of considerable evolution. With the frequencies rising, they areable to tune consciously much earlier in their lives to frequency levels thatwere denied to us. We have had to work to stay with the rising frequencies whilebabies today can come in at the highest levels available to this planet. Theywill be manifesting their higher knowledge and understanding of who they are andwhat they are doing here much earlier than we could. This doesn’t mean they arenecessarily more evolved than many others on Earth today. It means they canconnect earlier in their lives with the higher frequencies the planet is movinginto. I have heard many people say that babies today are different. Well this iswhy.This phenomenon alone will ensure that education will become a two-way process,as it should always have been anyway. We will tell the children what we know, orthink we know, and they will tell us what they know. Encouraging them to connectwith their highest potential will be the most important gift we can give to themand the world. The education of the future will be designed to bring out all theskills and knowledge that we possess and to help to lead us along the life pathwe have chosen before incarnation.Today we indoctrinate for The System. Tomorrow we will educate for life."},{"pageContent":"19Exploitation of the SpiritTHEY’RE after your mind. If they can control the way you think and feel they cancontrol your behaviour and hijack your individuality. They can take you over.‘They’ can take many forms: entities on other frequencies, religions, elementsof the New Age and the technology of mind-control under the guidance of thosegroups outside of governmental and democratic control who seek to rule theworld. In this chapter I am looking at some of the ways ‘they’ exploit thespirit and the minds of the human race, how we can stop it happening and how‘they’ are likely to react to the challenge of the changing consciousness thatthreatens their ambitions so fundamentally. It is important to know what isgoing on because the mind controllers in all their forms will be trying evenharder today to prevent the sort of changes I have outlined in the second halfof the book.Religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism and so many others have onlysurvived this long by fear, indoctrination and imposition. Without these, theywould have been long gone. In their extreme forms they amount to nothing lessthan spiritual fascism. Their fear, guilt and prejudice have been indoctrinatedthrough the generations over thousands of years and they have made a fundamentalcontribution to the division and pain on the Earth today. How ironic that thosewho proclaim the Jewish religion and condemn Islam could well have experiencedIslamic lives in the past and vice-versa. It’s the same with Protestants andCatholics, those two expressions of the Christian creed which have often been inconflict. Whenever I see Ian Paisley, the vehement Protestant spokesman inNorthern Ireland, a voice in my mind says, ‘He was a pope!’.While the major religions speak of a world of spirit, they have been created byand motivated by the misunderstandings in the world of matter under the guidanceof highly negative and imbalanced aspects of the Luciferic consciousness workingon the minds of those involved – not all of them, but enough. The religions havesought material and political power and that has been their driving force. Theyhave wished to control and deny free expression. The Inquisitions, the tortureand the mass murder of non-believers are evidence of that. Any creed which hasto indoctrinate, frighten and impose itself through violence and genocide has norespect for human life and freedom of thought and expression, nor for the veryvalues it is supposed to proclaim. If they are so confident that what they sayis true and credible, why do they feel the need to impose it and suppressalternative explanations? The answer to that is that, without imposition, itwould not be here today.We now have endless factions of Christianity, Mormons, Methodists, Baptists andmore far right mind-controlling sects springing up to take advantage ofhumanity’s spiritual emptiness and lack of meaning, particularly among theyoung. ‘Give us your money, do as we say and we’ll give you all the answersbecause we are the representatives of God. If you don’t do what we say, you willbe rejected by Jesus and go into the fires of hell.’ That sums up the basicmessage of so many sick and misguided groups which prey on the minds of thoseseeking meaning in this crazy world. Exploitation of the spirit is a growthindustry.For nearly two thousand years Christianity had a free hand to force its creedupon the population of, particularly, the Western world. British people wereforced to go to church by law and even today Christianity is given free air timequite outrageously day after day by the BBC and others to broadcast itspropaganda. The Christian view is taught, again by law, in the schools. TheChurch of England is part of the institution of State. Prime Ministers areinvolved in the selection of bishops and the monarch is crowned as ‘Defender ofthe Faith’. Most people have forgotten that the church became part of the statein the first place only because Henry VIII wanted a divorce and the Pope refusedto allow it. As we have seen, Henry’s decision to ignore the Pope and thedetermination of his daughter, Elizabeth I, to become supreme head of aProtestant Church of England led to Church and State becoming linked at alllevels. To this day, bishops are given automatic places in the House of Lordsand most of the clergy are often reluctant or frightened to speak out stronglyagainst governments who abuse the values for which the Church claims to stand.There are exceptions to this, but the general rule remains. Christianity andother religions have instigated, supported or watched without challenge, some ofthe most horrendous atrocities against humanity and the Earth. RomanCatholicism, that most arrogant of dictatorships controlled by the Brotherhood,still tries to force people to behave in ways it deems acceptable.Yet, despite all its imposition, privileges and advantages, the Christian Churchis crumbling before our eyes. Attendances continue to fall and churches to closebecause the money is no longer there to pay the bills. The Church of England hasbeen financed mostly from its land holdings and inherited wealth. The largestpart of this land, and therefore the Church’s wealth, came into its possessionthrough force of various kinds, violent or psychological. In some cases,landowners who went off to fight for God (Christian power and influence) in theCrusades were persuaded by the Church to sign over all their land and propertyin the event of their death. Giving all that to the Church would ensure a placein Heaven. Purely by coincidence it would also ensure that the Church becamericher. They could always come up with a biblical passage to support them:“And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father ormother, or wife or children, or lands for my name’s sake, shall receive anhundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.”But falling attendances and ill-fated property speculation from the late 1980shave dramatically reduced the wealth of the Church of England, and others arealso, or will soon be, in similar trouble. Around three-quarters of a billionpounds have been wiped off the Church of England’s assets and that is only whatthey have publicly admitted to. Parish churches have been told they will nowhave to raise more of their money for themselves because the central fund cannotafford to continue with donations at the level they have been in the past. Eventhe ability of the Church to pay pensions to its clergy has been questioned.Alongside this blow to its finances has come the public questioning of itsdogma. I have said before that part of the plan for the transformation has beenfor some of the volunteers to incarnate with the task of becoming part of thebastions of mind-control, like the Church, the media, the monarchy, and science.They would not remember this yet but they are being activated at the right timeto undermine these organisations from within. A wonderful example of this, Ibelieve, is the former Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins. He has attracted fiercecriticism from fanatics for questioning the Christian version of the VirginBirth, much of the Christmas story, the Second Coming and the existence of aplace called Hell to which sinners are supposed to be condemned for alleternity. Like most people who stand up and speak out with courage he was onlyarticulating what others believe but are too frightened say. It speaks much forthe feeble foundations of Christianity that those who attack the Bishop say heis questioning the whole basis on which the Christian religion stands or falls.If a creed depends on events that supposedly happened two thousand years ago, asreported in a book written by who knows who and who knows when, in who knowswhat circumstances, it doesn’t say much for the creed, does it? But the Bishophas had the courage to keep on speaking out and, slowly, others within theProtestant and Catholic churches are beginning to do the same. The realisationis beginning to dawn that ancient texts have to be read symbolically, notliterally, most of the time, and that you cannot use them as an infalliblerecord of truth. Such people have a long way to move before they encompass thesort of themes included in this book but they are already questioning thedogmatic view of the Church. We will see more people breaking ranks and sayingwhat they have long believed – that the dogma of the Christian creed is simplynot credible. You only have to read some Christian literature to realise that:“If you ignore him (Jesus) and reject him now, at the Day Of Judgment when wemust all stand before him he will ignore and reject you. ‘I do not know you,depart from me’.” (This is the ‘loving’ Jesus and the Prince of Peace?)“…after death there is no more opportunity to turn to Christ. It will be toolate.” (This is clearly bad news for the babies who die after a few minutes orthe little children who have not had the opportunity to know what Jesus isdemanding of them. And what about the children in parts of the world who do noteven know of Jesus?)“The good news of the Gospel is that Jesus, the perfect substitute, made theultimate once and for all payment on our behalf. It cost Him His life. As aresult God gives the free gift of salvation to those who believe in His Son.”(The publication from which this quote is taken included a chapter attackingalternative thought called ‘The Fine Art Of Baloney Detection’!).Throughout the Christian Church there are many thousands of people, like theQuakers, who have been attracted by the laudable values attributed to Jesus inthe Gospels. They have suffered the dogma but lived the values. They have usedthe Church to work for the good of the community. Indeed, there are somemagnificent human beings working within Christianity and other religions. Theseare people who would have found other ways to express their decency if theChurch had never existed. They are prisoners of the dogma within the Churchstructure but not within their own consciousness. When that structure is nomore, and that time is not far away, these Church people will be freed to liveand promote the values of caring, sharing, love and tolerance without beingforced to insist that everything in the Bible is true and the word of God. Suchvalues have been devalued by the dogma which anyone with a mind they cangenuinely call their own knows to be invention and not even inspired inventionat that.The rising frequencies will be affecting open minded, value-led, Church peoplein the same way that they are awakening others. As we have seen with the formerBishop of Durham, the awakening to their role in this life will be so powerfulthat they will not be able to stop themselves from speaking out, no matter whatthe short-term consequences for them might be. Tensions will grow between thisawakening consciousness within the Church and the closed minds who will seeksecurity in the face of these changes by the promotion of dogma in its mostextreme forms. The demise of the economic system will bring the political rightto the surface and the religious right will rise in the wake of the Church’scollapse. Both will fail as the transition proceeds, but they could causeconsiderable pain and disruption in the short term. There are likely to bewitch-hunts by the extremists against those within the religions who disagreewith them.I see in all the religions the rejection of dogma by sensible, open-mindedMuslims, Jews, Christians and others in the light of the changing consciousness.They will start to think for themselves and demand freedom of thought andexpression. Summon your courage, thinkers within the Church, and speak out. Thereligious robots also need to rebel. The extremes will react against thischallenge, creating potential for conflict. Mind-controlled fanatics who will bebefuddled even more by the rising vibrations could resort to violence andinquisition in an attempt to impose their will. There will be attempts toportray the upheavals of the transition, including the weather and geologicalevents, as God’s reprisals against a human race which does not behave as hesays, (i.e. what the religious dogmatists say). This will succeed with a fewpeople and there will be a temporary turning to these religions by those whofear what is happening but don’t wish to take responsibility for their ownthoughts and actions. I believe that the Brotherhood and the scientists of theunderground bases, may use their Walt Disney technology to project illusions ofgreat religious miracles to suggest that the Second Coming is upon us and thatpeople must repent (for repent, read ‘do as they say’).The Brotherhood will at the same time use the Church and destroy it when themoment arrives to introduce its own “Messiah” or “World king”, whatever formthat is supposed to take. Having manipulated the Vatican for its own ends, itwill bring down the Roman Catholic Church. It is vital that people do not buytheir ludicious, but sinister, alternative:“We shall not overtly lay a finger on existing churches, but we shall fightagainst them by criticism calculated to produce schism… only years divide usfrom the moment of the complete wrecking of the Christian religion. As for theother religions, we will have still less difficulty in dealing with them.”(Illuminati Protocol 17).Religion is under challenge on two fronts, the Brotherhood and the changingconsciousness, and the way we react to its demise is going to decide which onewill hold sway in the collective human mind.The greatest potential for trouble is from those countries where religiousfascist regimes are already in control. To the people of such countries I wouldoffer again these words: ‘100,000 Englishmen cannot control 300 million Indiansif those Indians will not cooperate’. Sadly, after a lifetime, often manylifetimes, of severe indoctrination, many of those in countries controlled bythe religious right have layers of conditioning to remove before they willchallenge that control in large enough numbers. As always in looking ahead,exactly what will happen is impossible to say because that will depend on howmany open up to the new frequencies and how humanity as a whole reacts toevents.Christianity is already well aware of the consequences for its influence andexistence being posed by the new consciousness. Its reaction to this has beenpainfully predictable. It is turning to the weapons it always uses in times oftrouble – feat and misrepresentation. Nothing encapsulates this approach andwhat we are likely to see from the dogma-supporters in the neat future betterthan a book called New Age versus the Gospel: Christianity’s Greatest Challenge.It was put thtough my letter box by a local Christian offering to ‘save’ me frommy misguided ways. He did this with the best of intentions I am sure but all thebook achieved was to confirm to me (a) the pathetic nature of dogmaticChristianity and (b) the way in which that dogma reacts to alternative thought.This is some of the blurb on the book cover:“Suddenly it is chic to be ‘spiritual’.” (Implication: you can only be spiritualif you are a Christian).“But the roots of today’s ‘spirituality’ are in Paganism, and not Christianity.”(A breathtaking statement when Christianity is recycled Paganism!)“…(The New Age)…a heady mix of Hinduism, Buddhism, and the hard core occultrepresents the greatest threat to Christianity in the history of the faith.”(The term ‘hard core occult’ is designed to frighten people. Occult is anotherword, like Paganism, that Christianity has assassinated. Originally it meant‘hidden’. To investigate occult mysteries is to say you are investigating hiddenmysteries. The word occult has been changed to imply devil worship. No singlebody has promoted the cause of extreme negativity more than Christianity throughthe centuries, except the Brotherhood. And the greatest threat to Christianityis, and has always been, itself.)“Christians need to know where New Age is coming from and how to counter itsclaims.” (misrepresent them.)“New Age Versus the Gospel analyses the menace, comes to grips with the Gospeland points to the Power for revival.” (The rise of evangelical dogmatists tocondemn awakening peoples as evil followers of the Devil and to condemn othermembers of their own creed who disagree with them as not real Christians).I have already been rebuked ‘in the name of the Lord’ by Christian evangelistsand been dubbed ‘the anti-Christ’ and it was no surprise that a whole chapterwas devoted to me in that book. I had to read the account about me a couple oftimes to confirm I wasn’t dreaming. It was hysterical. The writer said that Ihad claimed on a television programme to be a ‘New Age priest’. I am more likelyto call myself Nellie The Elephant than that. As you will see, I have greatreservations about some areas of what is termed New Age, although not for thereasons expressed in that book. What is more, the whole idea of priests isabhorrent to me. Stand by for more of such insults to the intelligence as theChristian dogmatists cling on to their sinking ship and thrash out at all whoare heading for the lifeboats.The foreword to the book was written by a cleric from All Souls Church, LanghamPlace, London. This is opposite the headquarters of BBC Radio and it is from AllSouls that much free Christian propaganda is broadcast to the nation by the‘independent’ BBC. The author of the foreword has a real problem with the ideathat all is One and all is God. Christianity is obsessed with portraying God asan outside force which is not part of us. Humans cannot find answers fromwithin, the book informs us, we have to be ‘rescued’ and that can only happen ifwe ‘find’ Jesus. Only by accepting that Jesus had to suffer horribly on thecross, in order for his father to agree to forgive the sins off the rest of us,can we be ‘saved’, apparently.He says that “from beginning to end, the New Age Movement expresses apreoccupation, even an infatuation, with self. It puts self in the place of Godand even declares that we ARE God.”Dogmatic Christianity is based on division and lack of self-worth – a divisionbetween different parts of Creation and the belief that we are born sinners.Love of self is seen as arrogant, selfish and offensive to God. In fact, it isthe lack of self love and, through that, love for others which is at the heartof humanity’s malaise. We cannot love, forgive and respect others until we canlove, forgive and respect ourselves. This link between love for self and lovefor others is highlighted in my book Heal The World. People who are aggressivein their behaviour towards others are people who hate themselves. Their hatredof self is projected outwards in an apparent hatred of the world. Yet, I wasbanned from speaking at the Central Hall in Westminster, London, because I amsaying love yourself, love the world.I had wanted to hire the hall for a talk. I rang them and learned that the dateI wanted was available. All was going well. Then, after the details had beenagreed, the lady asked for my name. When I told her, there was a silence. Aftera few seconds she recovered her voice but her attitude had changed. The hall wasrun by the Methodist Church, she told me. I would have to write in and outlinewhat I would be saying before permission to hire the hall would be granted. Somuch for freedom of speech, I thought. I wrote to them but they asked for moredetails. I wrote again to inform them that, in part, I would be saying that weneed to love, forgive and respect ourselves if we are do the same for others. Iwas not surprised that the Methodist trustees of the Central Hall replied that Iwould not be allowed to speak there. But I was rather taken aback by the reasonthey gave for this ban. Part of their letter said:“. . . .The doctrines of the evangelical faith which Methodism has held from thebeginning and still holds, are based upon the Divine revelation recorded in theHoly Scriptures. The Methodist Church acknowledges this revelation as thesupreme rule of faith and practice...”In other words, I take it, they believe that the Bible, despite all itscontradictions, incitements to violence, and (according to research in the 19thCentury) 36,191 translation errors in the King James version alone, is onehundred per cent accurate and infallible. The letter continued:“Central to the evangelical Christian doctrine is the belief that to love God isthe first commandment, and that implicit trust in Him is the path to salvation.It is our feeling that the promotion of a world-view which is based on‘self-love’ would be contrary to the Christian Gospel which Methodism seeks toexpound.”What have we come to? Someone is barred from speaking because a view whichinvolves loving, respecting and forgiving yourself and others is ‘contrary tothe Christian Gospel…’. Well, if that is the case, there is something seriouslywrong with the Gospels or the interpretation of them. No wonder the Church isdying on its feet when people hear this proclaimed from the pulpits; nor is itsurprising that Christianity has sought and fought to crush other views thatthreaten to expose its gigantic confidence trick on the minds of humanity. Inthe face of the new consciousness, this centuries-old prison of the mind has nochance of surviving, no matter how it presents the beliefs of those who areputting a different view. In his criticism of the New Age, the cleric from AllSouls gives us an excellent insight into the misunderstandings and desperationof Christianity. He says in his introduction:“To New Agers ‘transformation’ has nothing to do with people’s morality orbehaviour. It refers rather to the transformation of their consciousness, thediscovery and development of their own potential.”He says that as a criticism? And what will a transformation of consciousness doif not change the way people think and behave?Christianity lives in a dream world in which one generation indoctrinates thenext. It speaks of Divine Will and revelation when, in reality, its dogma wasdecided by a Roman Emperor, sundry bishops and misguided popes who soughteconomic and political power above spiritual insight. Its beliefs and ceremonieshave their origin in the Pagan beliefs they so despise. Nothing will be affectedmore by the transformation, all over the planet, than Christianity and its like.Open-minded true scientists are going to be inspired to confirm that allconsciousness is eternal, that Creation is made up of frequencies and thateverything is the same energy in different states of being. All is One. This andother discoveries and exposures will hasten the end of Christianity. We will seereal science (not the system-serving variety) and spirituality (not religion)speaking the same language. In fact, they already are.The new spirituality will have no rules and regulations. It will respect theright of all to believe what they think is correct. Its only challenge will beto those who wish to force others, through subtle and less subtle means, tobelieve what they want them to believe. My problem with Christianity and otherdogmatic religions is not with their right to believe what they wish, but withthe way they have tried to impose their beliefs through fear, violence andsupport from the State. Had that not been the case, this chapter would not haveneeded to be written, for the Christian religion would no longer be with us.During the transformation, people will be guided together, naturally, as higherselves reconnect powerfully with our physical personalities. It will be a freespirituality in which we can link with the Source and the higher levels when weare alone at home, with a few friends, or in vast groups. The choice will beours and one will be no more valid than the other. With so many churches builton energy points, I believe many could be used by spiritual groups asChristianity continues to fold and the churches close. They could be used forenergy-channelling and healing, rather than for the obsession with events whichtook place two thousand years ago. They will be places of love and joy where thegift of life can be celebrated with others. They will not be places of fear andguilt which emphasise ‘sin’ at the expense of people loving themselves. Withscience and spirituality working as one, we will be visiting and interactingwith other loving civilisations in the Universe and moving across frequencies.This will give a fantastic understanding of life and Creation compared with whatwe have now. Our spirituality will evolve rapidly as a result, if we are open toit.There are dangers on this road, however, even for those who accept the themes ofthis book. You can believe in reincarnation without serving others. You canspeak of peace and love without really meaning it at the core of your being. Itis easy for love and peace to become the spiritual equivalent of ‘have a niceday’. All that glitters is not gold and all that speaks of love and peace is notloving and peaceful. I have had several experiences, some very extreme, whichhave shown me this. So much of what is termed ‘New Age’ is merely the Old Age indisguise. It is, too often, the old thought patterns and reactions at work undera different cloak, that’s all.The New Age is a vast tapestry of people and beliefs and should not be seen as amovement or entity which thinks and believes the same. I refuse to call myself‘New Age’ because, like tens of millions of others, I am an aspect ofconsciousness awakening to my true self and that does not require titles orall-encompassing ‘movements’. It requires me to follow my own intuition at alltimes. Within the New Age field, there is substantial exploitation and there aremany who complicate simple themes. The more complicated you can make it appear,the more people will be dependent on others to decide what is best and to sellthem endless paraphernalia – rebirthing tanks, counselling, karma sessions andgoodness knows what else. The idea is to free people from spiritual dependencyand dependency of all kinds – not to create a new dependency on a guru, teacher,channeller or piece of equipment. That is not to say that some of these New Ageservices are not helpful when enlightened people are involved, they certainlyare. But too much is irrelevant and emotionally-dangerous exploitation. It canhold back your awakening and, in areas like karmic counselling, can, possibly,make you feel really bad about yourself if the counsellor tells you ofunpleasant things he or she claims you were responsible for in past lives. It isthe same with many channellers. Much channelled information is claptrap andneeds to be treated with great caution. There is a woman I met briefly with Yevawho now sends me a stream of strange letters claiming the most outrageousthings. She is quite obviously in a state of considerable confusion and in needof some enlightened help yet, on her business cards, she describes herself as apast life and present life counsellor. Be careful.The Brotherhood has infiltrated New Age and UFO groups and negativeextra-terrestrials could have been using channellers for thousands of years.Remember, they know this consciousness shift is planned and they want to stop itbecause they know the consequences of it for them. What better way than to feeda load of trash through channellers and ‘gurus’ to those who are being affectedby that shift? I read in one American New Age magazine some channelling,purporting to come from extra-terrestrials, that was calling for a worldgovernment. I have reservations, too, about some of the communications whichallegedly come from ‘Ascended Masters’. Whenever I hear that term, I feel reallybad about it. I have had bad vibes about some of the groups who have promotedthis idea of ‘Masters’, not least the ‘I am’ movement in the United States. TheMasters, according to New Age belief, are part of something called the GreatWhite Brotherhood who are said to be guiding humanity and the Earth through thistime of change. But are they? Someone is, for sure, but is it the entities whoare said to be Masters? I’m not yet convinced, you know. It could be that it isthe hierarchal tone of Ascended Masters that makes me feel less than positiveabout it and maybe the blind worship of these entities is not something theywish to happen. But, even if the ideas of Masters is correct, is everychannelled entity who claims to be from that consciousness stream really tellingthe truth? The answer to the latter is definitely “No”, because negative ETs andthe Luciferic consciousness use some channellers tuning to the lower frequenciesas a means to manipulate. Claiming to be from what is so widely accepted to be apositive consciousness stream like the Masters in an excellent way of doing it.I have no doubt that consciousness of a very high evolution is trying to guideus, and so are streams of positive, loving ETs from other Universalcivilizations, but we always have to be selective and wary about who is on theother end of the line. Being spiritual is vital to the transformation but beingstreetwise is equally so.Once again, the key is to follow our intuition, to listen to channelling whilebeing very selective. It is what we feel is right within our hearts that mattersand that doesn’t need the name of some Master of other to give it legitimacy. Ithas no name. It just is.A danger I see is that parts of the New Age could become nothing more thananother religion. The signs are already there. We have the gurus, the teachers,and the ‘living gods on Earth’. We see ‘disciples’ giving over theirresponsibility to think and act to these people in the same way that Christiansdo to the Bible and Jesus, and Muslims do to the Koran and Mohammed. I have metpeople who have been diverted from the journey to enlightenment by becomingobsessed with Indian gurus. I have seen how they have turned their homes intoshrines to them. I am not saying that we should not listen to the views of theguru figures, but no more so than anyone else. What I challenge is theunquestioning worship of them. This is another expression of humanity’scollective desire to pass on their responsibility to others for the way theythink and act. This is precisely what the Brotherhood wants. All over the NewAge arena are cosy little niches where people can become trapped and cease toevolve their understanding. Some have a certain belief about karma and theystick with it, no matter what other information comes to light; some channel thesame non-physical entities all their lives instead of expanding theirconsciousness to access higher and higher levels of information and knowledge;others mix only with those who agree with them and avoid thesometimes-unpleasant and painful necessity of taking their knowledge tosceptical audiences who have as much right to hear it as everyone else.I understand why some people find a nice little spot on the path and pitch theirtent. There have been many times in the past when I have wished to step off theroad and take a rest for a while from the frustration and aggravation ofspeaking to closed minds. But, if we are to speed the emergence of the newconsciousness and free humanity from the prison of indoctrination as smoothly aspossible, we must continually work to expand our own understanding and to passon what we believe for others to accept or reject. No-one said it would be easyand turning the New Age into another religion or giving our responsibility toguru figures will hold back the spiritual revolution. Respect and love are thefoundations of the new thinking – the worship of others is not, I would suggest.That’s the old way recycled.But the positive contribution of what is termed the New Age movement and which Iterm the Spiritual Renaissance far outweighs the negative. I have met thousandsof wonderful, loving, non-judgmental human beings who are doing a superb job inhelping people to awaken. No-one wants to stop the exploitation of the newconsciousness more than they do and, whenever I talk in these terms at meetings,the audience invariably shows its enthusiastic support for this view. What I amsaying is, be careful. Just because someone claims to be a channeller,astrologer, karmic counsellor or healer does not mean that they are proficientin those skills. Not even the well-known ones, necessarily. Look for those whoare recommended and respected by others in their field or by previous clients.More than anything, our own intuition should be our guide.I believe we could see three clearly identifiable groups during the transition.There will be those who reject the rising frequencies and who, as the yearspass, will be easy to recognise. There will be those who move so far and stopwhen they find a comfortable niche. And there will be others, the few probably,who go on searching, seeking and challenging, no matter what the personalconsequences in the short term. The further you walk along the road the lonelierit can become, as others stop through weariness, material gain or fear. Withevery step, you are tuning to a higher wavelength which evolves yourunderstanding and behaviour. From the perspective of those who have chosen tostop back down the road you may appear extreme and strange. If you keep walkingand seeking, you will be ridiculed and increasingly condemned by the first groupof padlocked minds. But I feel the second group, many of which will be withinwhat is termed the New Age Movement, will also be less than supportive of thoseon the front of the snowplough who will be questioning many of the themes onwhich some New Age niches depend. The road to enlightenment is never-ending.Just as we are leaving dogmatic religion behind, so we will eventually do thesame with many elements of current New Age dogma.The third example of the exploitation of the spirit and the mind is theBrotherhood with the behaviour-controlling technology I talked about in anearlier chapter. We are getting help with this from the higher levels who aretaking steps to block it as the transformation proceeds. The more who ask forthis to be done, the better. Mass forms of mind control can only affect us if weallow ourselves to de-link from the frequency of love to which our heart chakrasare tuned. If we think love and live love we can resist it.Another crucial way our minds are attacked is the programming by the messageswhich are projected at us through the media and our general lives every day. Weshould not underestimate their power to exploit our minds and spirits. AnIlluminati document called “Silent Weapons for a Quiet War” was found in 1986 inan IBM copier bought at a second hand sale. It was dated 1979. It encapsulatesall that I have been saying in this book, and has been the policy of theBilderberg Group since the 1950s:“Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon andgaining control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant ofbasic systems principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused,disorganised, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the otherhand.“This is achieved by:1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing alow-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems designand economics, and discouraging technical creativity.2. engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and theirindulgence in emotional and physical activities by:(a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape)by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media –especially the TV and newspapers.(b) giving them what they desire – in excess – “junk food for thought” – anddepriving them of what they really need.(c) re-writing history and law and subjecting the public to the deviantcreation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highlyfabricated outside priorities.These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of socialautomation technology. The general rule is that there is profit in confusion;the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore the best approach is to createproblems and then offer solutions.“In Summary:Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real socialissues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics,real law, and real history.Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth grade level.Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farmwith the other animals.”Recognise all that? Of course you do. It is the world we live in and it isexactly what the Illuminati have sought to create. If we are going to repel thisform of spiritual and mental exploitation we must start to think for ourselves;to get involved and to get informed about what is really going on; to make sureour children are informed and realise how they are being manipulated; to get offour knees and start to use our minds to their full potential; to reject thepressure to accept the drip, drip, drip of trivia designed to deaden ourconsciousness.The best way to challenge the negative is with joy, laughter, peace – andknowledge. The negative does not understand love and peace. And neverunderestimate your own potential and the power of your own psyche. You own it.It belongs to no-one else, not a church, guru, ascended master, piece oftechnology or ET. You are connected through your higher self to all Creation.Tap into that and no-one, but no-one, can exploit your spirit."},{"pageContent":"20The Earth Needs Rebels“All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing” –Edmund Burke.A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and a transformation of humanunderstanding can begin with one thought and one rebel.Every improvement in the human condition has come from someone pushing againstthe tide and speaking out, no matter what the consequences. That person iswithin all of us. Rebellion and the desire for positive change is at the heartof the human spirit.But what is rebellion?The meaning of the word is often misunderstood. Many of those who once came toheckle and laugh when I have spoken in public have been under the impressionthat they were rebels. Yet they are system servers doing exactly what they areprogrammed to do – undermine anyone prepared to challenge its control. Beers andjeers are not a rebellion. Others see rebels as those who wage war against theState. I am sure those in Northern Ireland who daily kill and maim think theyare rebels. But, again, they are merely puppets of the Luciferic consciousnessand the Brotherhood working through both sides. The rebellion of which I speakdoes not involve armed uprisings or violence of any kind. It is a rebellionagainst indoctrination and mind control; a refusal to be programmed a momentlonger by the ‘values’ imposed upon us by other generations and by the superrobots in politics, economics, science, religion and the Brotherhood networks.Thinking for yourself and having the confidence and courage to live what youbelieve – that’s rebellion.From this will come change in every aspect of life on Earth. Such rebellion willshow itself in this transition period in a refusal to cooperate with the systemand the Brotherhood elite. Awakening people will seek ways of disconnectingthemselves as much as possible from dependency upon its destructive delusions.They will have the courage to speak loudly and confidently, for they will knowthat the Robots’ Rebellion cannot be stopped. It is not for me to tell peoplewhat to do. I have no desire or stomach for that. But I support the campaign ofnon-cooperation and peaceful resistance which is gathering across the world. Ibelieve it will continue to grow and that some of its manifestations could be:⋆ A boycott of all banks which create money out of nothing and charge intereston it. I hope people will withdraw their money from these banks and even refuseto pay interest on their loans. The latter decision needs to be well coordinatedso that millions do it at the same time.⋆ Support for community banks and ethical banking which invest in projectsdesigned to benefit people and the planet.⋆ A refusal to cooperate with and in schools, universities and governmentdepartments in every country, until we have the free flow of information aboutwhat is really going on in secret and all the knowledge available.⋆ Constant sit-ins, peaceful occupation and mass protests at governmentheadquarters in every country, particularly the key players like the UnitedStates, Russia, Britain, Australia, Japan, the European Community and the UnitedNations.⋆ The peaceful disruption of all occasions of state in every country until weare told the truth and the closing down, by mass sit-ins, of roads and entrancesto parliamentary buildings.⋆ Mass peaceful resistance to projects that harm the environment. If they facesuch protests everywhere, the authorities will soon have to re-think and listen.⋆ The boycotting of all court proceedings that may arise from such actions andmass sit-ins at the court buildings to disrupt them, also.⋆ The bombardment of phone-in programmes and audience participation programmeswith questions and information about the secret government and what people cando to stop its manipulation.⋆ Protests and sit-ins at the headquarters of media organisations until theyrefuse to be Brotherhood poodles and start to report the truth to people.Boycotts of system-serving newspapers.⋆ The same at the headquarters and branches of the Freemasons in each countryand district and the immediate resignation by all members of the Freemasons andother secret organisations who no longer wish to be used as a front for themanipulation of the world.⋆ A refusal to vote for or support any politician who refuses to disclosewhether he or she is a member of a secret society or closely-connected to anyonewho is. A refusal to support any politician who is a member of any Brotherhoodfront organisation, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the TrilateralCommission or, in London, connected to the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs.The three most important words here are peaceful, determined and constant. Thosewho serve either knowingly or, more often, unknowingly, the forces who controlus do not deserve our hatred. They need our love and we can protest withlaughter and joy. They know not what they do and they are in prison as well. Ialways find it sad that some who protest against the activities of far rightgroups, do so with aggression and hatred in their hearts – the very sameemotions that motivate the far right. We need to protest with love because thatis the energy we wish to spread across the world. But our love must not beblind, it must be streetwise. We must remember that in the world of theBrotherhood black is white and white is black. Remember this also: Silence isconnivance. It is time to think, to take responsibility, and to speak and actagainst the silent, secret, tyranny. The Brotherhood acknowledge the threat totheir ambitions of individuals thinking for themselves and responding withaction:“(We wish to) discourage any kind of personal initiative which might hinder ouraffair. There is nothing more dangerous than personal initiative; if it hasgenius behind it, such initiative can do more than can be done by millions ofpeople among whom we have sown discord.” (Protocol 5).One individual can make a difference. We are not helpless, and the manipulationis not invincible, nor the ills of the world insurmountable. It depends on yourstate of mind. Problems can become solutions with a change of thought.If we are going to return freedom to the Earth, we have seriously to harass thesystem into realising that the robots are not cooperating any more. We will notbe lied to and manipulated. There are billions of us and only a relative handfulwho operate the secret world government. They cannot impose their will on usunless we allow them to. Are you going to be a robot or a rebel? That is yourchoice for there will be no in-betweens.Rebellion may appear on the surface to be the opposite of peace and love, but Idon’t believe that it is. Through this book I have strongly questioned thethought-patterns which control economics, politics, the media, science, religionand parts of the New Age. Some may see this as judgmental. But we are allresponsible for what has happened since Atlantis and we have all done things wewould rather not have done. It is pointless trying to be holier than thou andjudging others from that lofty and misguided perspective. Speaking out againstnegative thought-patterns is not being judgmental or unloving. After all, whatis love? Is it loving to ignore what these patterns are doing to people and theplanet? Is it loving to say that all is well and that there is no need to changewhat we do? Is it loving to avoid upsetting some people when, by speaking out,you may be able to alert others to the dangers and the exploitation? I thinknot. There are times when love is calling a spade a shovel if that is what isneeded for positive change. One of the most important channelled messages I havebeen given said:“True love does not always give the receiver what it would like to receive, butit will always give that which is best for it.”Or, to add some humility to that, what we believe is best for it. I have metmany people who think that protest and direct action, even of the peaceful kindI am advocating, is unloving. I would not agree with that and I feel that unlesswe begin a campaign of non-cooperation with The System, we will allow theBrotherhood elite to do some desperately unpleasant things in the wake of ourinaction. There have been some negative themes running through this book, butthey are not there to frighten, they are there to inform and alert. Have nofear. A new dawn awaits us and it will bring an end to such horrors.We are on the threshold of incomprehensible change as Mother Earth moves backinto alignment with the rest of the Universe and raises her consciousness to ahigher dimension of love and harmony. When you think of all the wonderful thingsthat happen in the world, even against the background I have described, thinkwhat life will be like when that disruption and disharmony is no more. That dayis near. We will see the truth that humanity is not evil or stupid, but loving,intelligent and overflowing with the love and creativity which it is desperateto express. It may not seem like that sometimes, but there are reasons for this,as we have seen, and the period of Luciferic opportunity is almost over.We shall love the Earth and love each other. We shall love those who love us andlove those who hate us. We shall not choose between them, for all are we and weare all. We are each other and the truth of that is re-emerging in ourconsciousness. Open your heart, follow your heart, and your life and all life onthis planet will be transformed.We are here to change the world. We chose to come and our time has come. Wecannot and we will not fail."},{"pageContent":"Bibliography> Allan, Derek & Delair, Bernard, When the Earth Nearly Died – Compelling> Evidence of World Catastrophe, 10,500BC: Gateway Books, Bath, & Atrium> Publishers Group, Lower Lake, CA, 1994.> Blumrich, Joseph F, The Space Ships of Ezekiel: Corgi, London 1974.> Bowen, Russell S, The Immaculate Deception: dist. by American West, Boulder,> CO.> Bramley, William, Gods of Eden: Avon Books, New York.> Cooper, Bill, Behold a Pale Horse: Light Technology Publishing, PO Box 1495,> Sedona, AZ 86336> Dauncey, Guy, After the Crash – Emergence of the Rainbow Economy: Green Print,> London, 1988.> Findlay, Arthur, The Curse of Ignorance (2 vols): Arthur Findlay College,> Stansted Hall, Stansted Mountfichet, Essex.> Good, Timothy, Above Top Secret – Worldwide UFO Cover-up: Grafton, London,> 1989.
