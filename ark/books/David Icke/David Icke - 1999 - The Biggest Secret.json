A crossroads where we makedecisions which will influence life on Earth well into the future of what wecall time. We can fling open the doors of the mental and emotional prisons whichhave confined the human race for thousands of years. Or we can allow the agentsof that control to complete their agenda for the mental, emotional, spiritualand physical enslavement of every man, woman and child on the planet with aworld government, army, central bank and currency, underpinned by a microchippedpopulation.I know that sounds fantastic, but if the human race lifted its eyes from thelatest soap opera or game show for long enough to engage its brain, it would seethat these events are not just going to happen – they are happening. Themomentum for the centralised control of global politics, business, banking,military and media is gathering pace by the hour. The microchipping of people isalready being suggested and, in many cases, underway. Whenever a hidden agendais about to be implemented there is always the period when the hidden has tobreak the surface for the final push into physical reality. This is what we areseeing now in the explosion of mergers between global banking and businessempires, and the speed at which political and economic control is beingcentralised through the European Union, the United Nations, the World TradeOrganisation, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and the stream of otherglobalising bodies like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and theG-7/G-8 summits. Behind this constant and coordinated centralisation is a tribeof interbreeding bloodlines which can be traced to the ancient Middle and NearEast. They emerged from there to become the royalty, aristocracy and priesthoodof Europe before expanding their power across the world, largely through the‘Great’ British Empire. This allowed the tribe to export its bloodlines to allthe countries the British and European powers occupied, including the UnitedStates where they continue to run the show to this day. There have been justover 40 Presidents of the United States and 33 of them have been geneticallyrelated to two people, England’s King Alfred the Great and Charlemagne, thefamous monarch in 9th century France. Throughout this whole period the agenda ofthis bloodline has been gradually implemented until we have reached the pointtoday where centralised global control is possible.If you want to know what life will be like unless we wake up fast, take a lookat Nazi Germany. That is the world that awaits the global population as the planI call the Brotherhood Agenda unfolds across the year 2000 and into the first 12years of the new century. 2012 particularly, appears to be a crucial year forreasons we shall discuss. People have no idea of the abyss we are staring intoor the nature of the world we are leaving for our children to endure and mostpeople don’t seem to care. They would much rather ignore the obvious and go intodenial of a truth that’s splatting them between the eyes. I feel like the cowwho runs into the field screaming: “Hey, you know that truck that takes some ofour friends away every month? Well they don’t take them to another field like wethought. They shoot them in the head, bleed them dry, cut them up, and put thepieces into packets. Then those humans buy them and eat them!” Imagine what thereaction of the rest of the herd would be: “You’re crazy man. They’d never dothat. Anyway, I’ve got shares in that trucking company and I get a good return.Shut up, you’re making waves.”[../Images/00008.jpg]Figure 1: Knowledge is in the hands of the few and the rest are kept ignorant.The classic structure for manipulation and control.The Agenda I am exposing has been unfolding over thousands of years to itscurrent point close to completion, because humanity has given away its mind andits responsibility. Humanity would rather do what it thinks is right for itselfin the moment than consider the wider consequences of its behaviour for humanexistence. Ignorance is bliss, we say, and that’s true – but only for a while.It may be bliss not to know a tornado is coming because you have no need toworry or take action. But while your head is in the sand and your bum is in theair, the tornado is still coming. If you looked up and faced it, disaster couldbe avoided, but ignorance and denial always ensure that you will get the fullforce and the most extreme consequences, because it strikes when least expectedand you are least prepared. Like I say, ignorance is bliss – but only for solong. We create our own reality by our thoughts and actions. For every action ornon-action there is a consequence. When we give our minds and our responsibilityaway, we give our lives away. If enough of us do it, we give the world away andthat is precisely what we have been doing throughout known human history. Thisis why the few have always controlled the masses. The only difference today isthat the few are now manipulating the entire planet because of the globalisationof business, banking and communications. The foundation of that control hasalways been the same: keep the people in ignorance, fear and at war withthemselves. Divide, rule and conquer while keeping the most important knowledgeto yourself (see Figure 1). And as we shall see in this book, those who haveused these methods to control humanity for thousands of years are members of thesame force, the same interbreeding tribe, following a long term Agenda which isnow reaching a major point on its journey. The global fascist state is upon us.And yet, it doesn’t have to be like this. The real power is with the many, notthe few. Indeed infinite power is within every individual. The reason we are socontrolled is not that we don’t have the power to decide our own destiny, it isthat we give that power away every minute of our lives. When something happensthat we don’t like, we look for someone else to blame. When there is a problemin the world, we say “What are they going to do about it”. At which point they,who have secretly created the problem in the first place, respond to this demandby introducing a ‘solution’ – more centralisation of power and erosion offreedom. If you want to give more powers to the police, security agencies andmilitary, and you want the public to demand you do it, then ensure there is morecrime, violence and terrorism, and then it’s a cinch to achieve your aims. Oncethe people are in fear of being burgled, mugged or bombed, they will demand thatyou take their freedom away to protect them from what they have been manipulatedto fear. The Oklahoma bombing is a classic of this kind, as I detail in …And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. I call this technique problem-reaction-solution.Create the problem, encourage the reaction “something must be done”, and thenoffer the solution. It is summed up by the Freemason motto ‘Ordo Ab Chao’ –order out of chaos. Create the chaos and then offer the way to restore order.Your order.The masses are herded and directed by many and various forms of emotional andmental control. It is the only way it could be done. The few can’t controlbillions of people physically, just as farm animals cannot be controlledphysically unless a large number of people are involved. Two pigs escaped from aslaughterhouse in England and eluded capture for so long, despite the efforts ofmany people to catch them, that they became national celebrities. Physicalcontrol of the global population cannot work. But it is not necessary when youcan manipulate the way people think and feel to the point where they ‘decide’ todo what you want them to do anyway and demand that you introduce laws that youwant to introduce. It is an old, old adage that if you want someone to dosomething, get them to believe it is their idea. Humanity is mind controlled andonly slightly more conscious than your average zombie. Far fetched? No, no. Idefine mind control as the manipulation of someone’s mind so that they think,and therefore act, the way you want them to. Under this definition, the questionis not how many people are mind controlled, but how few are not. Everyone is toa larger or lesser extent. When you are persuaded by advertising or hype to buysomething you don’t really need or want, you are being mind controlled. When youread or hear a slanted news story and allow it to affect your perception of aperson or event, you are being mind controlled. Look at the training for thearmed forces. It is pure mind control. From day one you are told to take orderswithout question and if some berk in a peaked cap tells you to shoot people youhave never met and know nothing about, you must shoot without question. This isthe “Yes sir!” mentality and it pervades the non-military world, also. “Well, Iknow it’s not right, but the boss told me to do it and I had no choice.” Nochoice? We never have no choice. We have choices we would like to make andchoices we would rather less like to make. But we never have no choice. To sayso is another cop out.The list of mind manipulating techniques is endless. They want your mind becausewhen they have that, they have you. The answer lies in taking our minds back,thinking for ourselves and allowing others to do the same without fear ofridicule or condemnation for the crime of being different. If we don’t do that,the Agenda I am going to outline will be implemented. But if we do regaincontrol of our minds and achieve mental sovereignty, the Agenda cannot happenbecause the foundation of its existence will have been taken away. I’ve talkedand researched in more than 25 countries and I see the same process in every oneof them. Identical policies and structures are introduced in line with a GlobalAgenda, yet at the same time there is quite obviously a global awakening as moreand more people hear the spiritual alarm clock and emerge from their mental andemotional slumbers, the terrestrial trance. Which force will prevail in theseMillennium years to 2012? That is up to us. We create our own reality by ourthoughts and actions. If we change our thoughts and actions we will change theworld. It’s that simple.In this book I am going to chart the history of the interbreeding tribe ofbloodlines which control the world today and reveal the true nature of theGlobal Agenda. And I would emphasise that I am exposing an Agenda, not aconspiracy as such. The conspiracy comes in manipulating people and events toensure the Agenda is introduced. These conspiracies take three main forms:conspiring to remove people and organisations that are a threat to the Agenda(the assassination of Diana, Princess of Wales); conspiring to put people intopositions of power who will make the Agenda happen (George Bush, HenryKissinger, Tony Blair, et al); and conspiring to create events which will makethe public demand the Agenda is introduced through problem-reaction-solution(wars, terrorist bombs, economic collapses). In this way all these apparentlyunconnected events and manipulations become aspects of the same conspiracy tointroduce the same Agenda. In the months and years that follow, every time youpick up a paper, turn on the television or hear a speech from a political orbusiness leader, you are going to see the information outlined here coming topass. You already can if you understand the scam. Look at my previous books like…And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free, The Robots’ Rebellion, thevideo Turning Of The Tide, and the work of other researchers over decades andyou will see that what was predicted is happening. This is not prophecy, it ismerely the prior knowledge of the Agenda. So will the global fascist state berealised in the next few years? That question can only be answered by another:are we going to become people or continue as sheeple?The Agenda depends on the latter."},{"pageContent":"WARNINGThere is an enormous amount of challenging information in this book.

[../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos5046]There were two ways of writing this book. I could have held back informationwhich is stunningly bizarre, but true. This would be the easy way, stayingwithin the comfort zone and communicating only that which would not challengetoo many people’s sense of possibility.Or I could treat the readers like fully formed, fully connected,multidimensional, adult human beings and communicate all the relevantinformation, including some which will stretch their sense of reality tobreaking point. As always, I have chosen the latter. It is not for me to editinformation for the readers, it is for the readers to edit the information forthemselves. How arrogant and patronising to think that I should keep informationback from people because “they’re not ready for it”. Who am I to decide that?And how can I know if they are “ready for it” unless they hear it and cantherefore decide for themselves? Some of my friends have urged me to tell peoplethe basic story, but “for God’s sake don’t mention the reptiles”. You will seewhat they mean by that very shortly. I understand their concern, but I can onlybe myself. And I have to tell all that I know and not only that which maintainsthe comfort zone. That’s just me, the way I am. Of course the theme of the bookwill attract ridicule from those with a vision of possibility the size of a peaand, naturally, from those who know it to be true and don’t want the public tobelieve it. But so what? Who cares? I don’t. As Gandhi said: “Even if you are ina minority of one, the truth is still the truth.” So here’s the story, punchesunpulled.In summary, a race of interbreeding bloodlines, a race within a race in fact,were centred in the Middle and Near East in the ancient world and, over thethousands of years since, have expanded their power across the globe. A crucialaspect of this has been to create a network of mystery schools and secretsocieties to covertly introduce their Agenda while, at the same time, creatinginstitutions like religions to mentally and emotionally imprison the masses andset them at war with each other. The hierarchy of this tribe of bloodlines isnot exclusively male and some of its key positions are held by women. But interms of numbers it is overwhelmingly male and I will therefore refer to thisgroup as the Brotherhood. Even more accurately, given the importance of ancientBabylon to this story, I will also call it the Babylonian Brotherhood. The planthey term their ‘Great Work of Ages’, I will call the Brotherhood Agenda. Thepresent magnitude of Brotherhood control did not happen in a few years, even afew decades or centuries: it can be traced back thousands of years. Thestructures of today’s institutions in government, banking, business, militaryand the media have not been infiltrated by this force, they were created by themfrom the start. The Brotherhood Agenda is, in truth, the Agenda of manyMillennia. It is the unfolding of a plan, piece by piece, for the centralisedcontrol of the planet.The bloodline hierarchy at the top of the human pyramid of control andsuppression passes the baton across the generations, mostly sons followingfathers. The children of these family lines who are chosen to inherit the batonare brought up from birth to understand the Agenda and the methods ofmanipulating the ‘Great Work’ into reality. Advancing the Agenda becomes theirindoctrinated mission from very early in their lives. By the time their turncomes to join the Brotherhood hierarchy and carry the baton into the nextgeneration, their upbringing has moulded them into highly imbalanced people.They are intellectually very sharp, but with a compassion bypass and anarrogance that they have the right to rule the world and control the ignorantmasses who they view as inferior. Any Brotherhood children who threaten tochallenge or reject that mould are pushed aside or dealt with in other ways toensure that only ‘safe’ people make it to the upper levels of the pyramid andthe highly secret and advanced knowledge that is held there. Some of thesebloodlines can be named. The British House of Windsor is one of them, so are theRothschilds, the European royalty and aristocracy, the Rockefellers, and therest of the so-called Eastern Establishment of the United States which producesthe American presidents, business leaders, bankers and administrators. But atthe very top, the cabal which controls the human race operates from the shadowsoutside the public domain. Any group which is so imbalanced as to covet thecomplete control of the planet will be warring within itself as differentfactions seek the ultimate control. This is certainly true of the Brotherhood.There is tremendous internal strife, conflict and competition. One researcherdescribed them as a gang of bank robbers who all agree on the job, but thenargue over how the spoils will be divided. That is an excellent description andthrough history different factions have gone to war with each other fordominance. In the end, however, they are united in their desire to see the planimplemented and at the key moments they overwhelmingly join forces to advancethe Agenda when it comes under challenge.You will probably have to go back hundreds of thousands of years to find thestarting point of this story of human manipulation and of the family lines whichorchestrate the Great Work. The more I have researched this over the years, themore obvious it has become to me that the origin of the bloodlines and the planfor the takeover of the Earth goes off planet to a race or races from otherspheres or dimensions of evolution. Extraterrestrial as we call them. If youdoubt the existence of extraterrestrial life then consider this for a moment.Our Sun is only one of some 100 billion stars in this galaxy alone. Sir FrancisCrick, the Nobel laureate, says there are an estimated 100 billion galaxies inour universe and he believes there are at least one million planets in ourgalaxy that could support life as we know it. Think of what the figure might befor the entire universe, even before we start looking at other dimensions ofexistence beyond the frequency range of our physical senses. If you travelled atthe speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, it would take you 4.3 years toreach the nearest star to this solar system and even at that speed it takes 100years for light to cross just this galaxy. It says much for humanity’s level ofindoctrination that to speak of extraterrestrial life is to appear cranky, yetto dismiss it and suggest that life has only emerged on this one tiny planet isconsidered credible! You only have to consider the amazing structures thatabounded in the ancient world to see that an advanced race existed then. We aretold that only people primitive in comparison to modern humans lived in thesetimes, but that is patently ludicrous. Like most official ‘thinking’ thehistorical and archaeological establishment makes up its own stories, calls themproven facts, and simply ignores the overwhelming evidence that they are wrong.The idea is not to educate, but to indoctrinate. Anyone who doesn’t conform tothe official line of history is isolated by their fellow historians andarchaeologists who either know their jobs, reputations and funding are saferwhen they stick to the official version, or, frankly, they cannot see beyond theend of their noses. The same can be said of most people in the teaching and‘intellectual’ professions.All over the planet are fantastic structures built thousands of years ago whichcould only have been created with technology as good as, often even better than,we have today. At Baalbek, north east of Beirut in the Lebanon, three massivechunks of stone, each weighing 800 tons, were moved at least a third of a mileand positioned high up in a wall. This was done thousands of years BC! Anotherblock nearby weighs 1,000 tons – the weight of three jumbo jets. How was thispossible? Official history does not wish to address such questions because ofwhere it might lead. Can you imagine ringing a builder today and asking him todo that? “You want me to do WHAT?” he would say, “You’re crazy.” In Peru are themysterious Nazca Lines. The ancients scored away the top surface of the land toreveal the white subsurface and through this method were created incredibledepictions of animals, fish, insects and birds. Some of them are so large theycan only be seen in their entirety from 1,000 feet in the air! The knowledgewhich allowed wonders like Nazca, Baalbek, the Great Pyramid at Giza and otheramazing creations to be built with such precision and scale, came from anadvanced race who, in ancient times, lived among a far more primitive generalpopulation. This race is described as ‘the gods’ in the Old Testament texts andother works and in oral traditions of antiquity. I can hear followers of theBible denying that their book speaks of ‘the gods’. But it does. When the word‘God’ is used in the Old Testament it is often translated from a word that meansgods, plural – Elohim and Adonai are two examples. You can easily understandthat a race performing technological feats of such magnitude should be seen as‘gods’ by a people unable to comprehend such abilities. In the 1930s, Americanand Australian servicemen landed their planes in remote parts of New Guinea todrop supplies for their troops. The locals, who had never seen a plane, believedthe servicemen were gods and they became a focus of religious beliefs. Thiswould have been even more extreme in the ancient world had their advanced racebeen beings from other planets, stars or dimensions, flying craft more advancedthan anything flown (at least officially!) by today’s military. An influx ofknowledge from outside this planet or another source would explain so many ofthe ‘mysteries’ that official history greets with a deafening silence. Theincredible feats of building also become explainable and so does the mystery ofwhy early civilisations like Egypt and Sumer (the land of Shinar in the Bible)began at the peak of their development and then fell into decay, when the normalcourse of evolution is to start at a lower level and slowly advance throughlearning and experience. There was clearly an infusion of highly advancedknowledge that was later lost to most people. In every culture throughout theworld are ancient stories and texts which describe the ‘gods’ who brought thisadvanced knowledge. This would again explain the mystery of how the ancients hada phenomenal understanding of astronomy. There are endless legends all over theworld of a time they call the Golden Age, which was destroyed by cataclysm andthe ‘fall of Man’. The ancient Greek poet, Heslod, described the world beforethe ‘fall’:“Man lived like Gods, without vices or passions, vexation or toil. In happycompanionship with divine beings (extraterrestrials?), they passed their days intranquillity and joy, living together in perfect equality, united by mutualconfidence and love. The Earth was more beautiful than now, and spontaneouslyyielded an abundant variety of fruits. Human beings and animals spoke the samelanguage and conversed with each other (telepathy). Men were considered mereboys at a hundred years old. They had none of the infirmities of age to troublethem and when they passed to regions of superior life, it was in a gentleslumber.” 1 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos87157]Utopian as that may sound, there are countless stories from every ancientculture which describe the world in the distant past in those terms. We canrecreate that vision again if only we change the way we think and feel. The mostcomprehensive accounts of an advanced race are contained in tens of thousands ofclay tablets found in 1850 about 250 miles from Baghdad, Iraq, by an EnglishmanSir Austen Henry Layard as he excavated the site of Nineveh, the capital ofAssyria. This was located near the present Iraqi town of Mosul. Other finds havefollowed in this region which was once called Mesopotamia. The original sourceof this knowledge was not the Assyrians, but the Sumerians who lived in the samearea from, it is estimated, 4,000 to 2,000 BC. I will refer to the clay tablets,therefore, as the Sumerian Texts or Tablets. They are one of the greatesthistorical finds imaginable and yet 150 years after they were discovered theyare still ignored by conventional history and education. Why? Because theydemolish the official version of events. The most famous translator of thesetablets is the scholar and author Zecharia Sitchin, who can read Sumerian,Aramaic, Hebrew and other Middle and Near Eastern languages.2[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos87389] He has extensively researched andtranslated the Sumerian Tablets and has no doubt that they are describingextraterrestrials. Some researchers say that he used a later version of theSumerian language to translate an earlier one and, therefore, some of histranslations may not be 100% accurate. I think his themes are correct, indeedother accounts and evidence supports this, but I personally doubt some of thedetail. I think that a number of Sitchin’s interpretations are extremelyquestionable, while I agree with the overall thesis. According to histranslations (and others) the Texts say that the Sumerian civilisation, fromwhich many features of modern society derive, was a “gift from the gods”. Notmythical gods, but physical ones who lived among them. The Tablets call thesegods the AN.UNNAK.KI (Those who from Heaven to Earth came), and DIN.GIR (TheRighteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets). The name of Sumer itself was KI.EN.GIR(The Land of the Lord of the Blazing Rockets and also Land of the Watchers,according to Sitchin). The ancient text known as the Book of Enoch also callsthe gods ‘the Watchers’, as did the Egyptians. The Egyptian name for their gods,the Neteru, literally translates as Watchers and they said that their gods camein heavenly boats.[../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 2: The solar system showing the location of the asteroid belt betweenMars and Jupiter which, though the details vary, many ancient and modernaccounts suggest is the remains of a planet or part of a planet.According to Zecharia Sitchin, the tablets describe how the Anunnaki came from aplanet called Nibiru (The Planet of the Crossing) which he believes has a 3,600year elliptical orbit that takes it between Jupiter and Mars and then out intofar space beyond Pluto. Sitchin says that the Sumerians called this planetTiamat, or the Water Monster. He says that it was debris from Tiamat’s collisionwith the Nibiru moon which created the Great Band Bracelet – the asteroid beltwhich is found between Mars and Jupiter. What remained of Tiamat was thrown intoanother orbit, Sitchin’s translations claim, and eventually it became the Earth(see Figure 2). The Sumerian name for the Earth, Sitchin says, means the CleavedOne because a vast hole was created by the collision. Of course, remove thePacific Ocean and you would still have an enormous cavity. Other researchers,however, say that the Sumerians saw the Draco star system as the dragon andcalled that Tiamat, which was a Babylonian goddess who turned herself into adragon to give herself a fighting advantage when other gods began challengingher. This connection to the Draco constellation will become very relevant in thenext chapter.The Tablets are the written accounts of oral traditions that go back enormousamounts of time and you have to be careful that details have not been added orlost and that we don’t take symbolism or parable as literal truth. I am surethat some confusion did occur in this way. I have doubts myself about theNibiru–Tiamat scenario and its alleged timescale. But there is much truth in theTexts which can be proven, not least in their knowledge of astronomy. TheTablets depict the solar system with the planets in their correct positions,orbits and relative sizes, and their accuracy has only been confirmed in thelast 150 years since some of these planets have been found. The Tablets describethe nature and colour of Neptune and Uranus in ways that have only beenconfirmed in the last few years! What’s more, the modern ‘experts’ did notexpect those planets to look as they did, yet the Sumerians knew thousands ofyears BC what our ‘advanced’ science has only just discovered.Most stunning about the Sumerian Tablets is the way they describe the creationof homo sapiens. Sitchin says the Anunnaki came to the Earth an estimated450,000 years ago to mine gold in what is now Africa. The main mining centre wasin today’s Zimbabwe, an area the Sumerians called AB.ZU (deep deposit), heclaims. Studies by the Anglo-American Corporation have found extensive evidenceof gold mining in Africa at least 60,000 years ago, probably 100,000.3[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos87896] The gold mined by the Anunnaki wasshipped back to their home planet from bases in the Middle East, Sitchin claimsthe Tablets say. I think there is much more to know about this ‘gold mining’business, and I don’t believe that was the main reason they came here. At firstthe gold mining was done by the Anunnaki version of their working classes,Sitchin says, but eventually there was a rebellion by the miners and theAnunnaki royal élite decided to create a new slave race to do the work. TheTablets describe how the genes of the Annunaki and those of the native humanswere combined in a test tube to create the ‘updated’ human capable of doing thetasks the Anunnaki required. The idea of test tube babies would have soundedridiculous when the tablets were found in 1850, but that is precisely whatscientists are now able to do. Again and again modern research supports thethemes of the Sumerian Tablets. For instance, there was a sudden and so farunexplained upgrade of the human physical form around 200,000 years ago.Official science is silent on the cause of this and mutters terms like ‘themissing link’. But some unavoidable facts need to be addressed. Suddenly theprevious physical form known as homo erectus became what we now call homosapiens. From the start the new homo sapiens had the ability to speak a complexlanguage and the size of the human brain increased massively. Yet the biologistThomas Huxley said that major changes like this can take tens of millions ofyears. This view is supported by the evidence of homo erectus which appears tohave emerged in Africa about 1.5 million years ago. For well in excess of amillion years their physical form seems to have remained the same, but then, outof nowhere, came the dramatic change to homo sapiens. About 35,000 years agocame another sudden upgrade and the emergence of homo sapiens sapiens, thephysical form we see today. The Sumerian Tablets name the two people involved inthe creation of the slave race. They were the chief scientist called Enki, Lordof the Earth (Ki=Earth) and Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti (Lady Life) becauseof her expertise in medicine. She was later referred to as Mammi, from whichcomes mama and mother. Ninkharsag is symbolised in Mesopotamian depictions by atool used to cut the umbilical cord. It is shaped like a horseshoe and was usedin ancient times. She also became the mother goddess of a stream of religionsunder names like Queen Semiramis, Isis, Barati, Diana, Mary and many others,which emerged from the legends of this all over the world. She is often depictedas a pregnant woman. The texts say of the Anunnaki leadership:They summoned and asked the goddess,the midwife of the gods, the wise birthgiver (saying),“To a creature give life, create workers!Create a primitive worker,that he may bear the yoke!Let him bear the yoke assigned by Enlil,Let the worker carry the toil of the gods!” 4[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88005]Enlil was commander of the Anunnaki and Enki was his half-brother. Enki andNinkharsag had many failures as they sought the right genetic mix, the Tabletstell us. There are accounts of how they created people with major defects andalso human–animal hybrids. Horrible stuff, and exactly what is claimed to behappening today in the extraterrestrial–human underground bases around theworld. The story of Frankenstein, the man created in a laboratory, could besymbolic of these events. It was written by Mary Shelley, the wife of the famouspoet. He and she were high initiates of the secret society network which hashoarded and suppressed this knowledge since ancient times. The Tablets say thatEnki and Ninkharsag eventually found the right mix which became the first homosapiens, a being the Sumerians called a LU.LU (One who has been mixed). This isprobably the biblical ‘Adam’. LU.LU was a genetic hybrid, the fusing of homoerectus with the genes of the ‘gods’ to create a slave, a human worker bee, some200,000–300,000 years ago. A female version was also created. The Sumerian namefor human was LU, the root meaning of which is worker or servant, and it wasalso used to imply domesticated animals. This is what the human race has beenever since. The Anunnaki have been overtly and now covertly ruling the planetfor thousands of years. The mistranslation of the Bible and symbolic languagetaken literally has devastated the original meaning and given us a fantasystory. Genesis and Exodus were written by the Hebrew priestly class, theLevites, after they were taken to Babylon from around 586 BC. Babylon was in theformer lands of Sumer and so the Babylonians, and therefore the Levites, knewthe Sumerian stories and accounts. It was from these records overwhelmingly,that the Levites compiled Genesis and Exodus. The source is obvious. TheSumerian tablets speak of E.DIN (The Abode of the Righteous Ones). This connectswith the Sumerian name for their gods, DIN.GIR (the Righteous Ones of theRockets). So the Sumerians spoke of Edin and Genesis speaks of the Garden ofEden. This was a centre for the gods, the Anunnaki. The Sumerian Tablets speakof King Sargon the Elder being found as a baby floating in a basket on the riverand brought up by a royal family. Exodus speaks of Moses being found as a babyfloating in a basket on the river by a royal princess and how he was brought upby the Egyptian royal family. The list of such ‘coincidences’ goes on and on.The Old Testament is a classic example of the religious recycling which hasspawned all the religions. So when you are looking for the original meaning ofGenesis and the story of Adam you have to go back to the Sumerian accounts tosee how the story has been doctored. Genesis says that ‘God’ (the gods) createdthe first man, Adam, out of ‘dust from the ground’ and then used a rib of Adamto create Eve, the first woman. Zecharia Sitchin points out that the translationof ‘dust from the ground’ comes from the Hebrew word tit (sorry mother) and thisitself is derived from the Sumerian term, TI.IT, which means ‘that which is withlife’. Adam was not created from dust from the ground, but from that which iswith life – living cells. The Sumerian term, TI, means both rib and life andagain the translators made the wrong choice. Eve (She Who Has Life) was notcreated from a rib, but from that which has life – living cells. The human eggfor the creation of the Lulu/Adam came from a female in Abzu, Africa, accordingto the Sumerians, and modern fossil finds and anthropological research suggeststhat homo sapiens did indeed come out of Africa. In the 1980s, Douglas Wallaceof Emory University in Georgia compared the DNA (the blueprint for physicallife) of 800 women and concluded that it came from a single female ancestor.5[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88095] Wesley Brown of the University ofMichigan said, after examining the DNA of 21 women of different geneticbackgrounds from around the world, that they all originated from a single sourcewho had lived in Africa between 180,000 and 300,000 years ago.6[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88192] Rebecca Cann of the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley did the same with 147 women of diverse racial andgeographical backgrounds and she said their common genetic inheritance came froma single ancestor between 150,000 and 300,000 years ago.7[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88282] Another study of 150 American womenfrom genetic lines going back to Europe, Africa and the Middle East, togetherwith Aborigines from Australia and New Guinea, concluded that they had the samefemale ancestor who lived in Africa between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago.8[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88365] Personally I think the human racewas seeded by many sources, not just the Annunaki, but the hybrid bloodlinesthey created are crucial to the story.Africa is the key to understanding so much, but it has been so ignored byresearchers. In 1999, as I was preparing this updated edition, I spent manyhours with my friend Credo Mutwa, a Zulu sanusi, or what others call a shaman.He is one of only two sanusi left in South Africa and he is the most astonishinggenius of a man it has been my honour to meet. Credo is the official storytellerand keeper of ancient knowledge for the Zulu nation. He talked with me about theendless stories in the African tradition of how a race from the stars interbredwith humans and created a crossbreed race; how these crossbreeds were made the‘royal’ ruling lines of the ancient world; and how they have been controllingthe planet ever since. (These conversations were filmed and are now available ontwo videos.) The central and southern African accounts call the Annunaki undermany names, but, as Credo says, they are speaking of the same beings. He showedme an amazing ‘necklace’, incredibly heavy and made of copper. It is at least500 years old and Credo believes it goes back a thousand years or more (seepicture section). Hanging from it are symbols telling the story of Africa, andthere at the front is an extraterrestrial with a big willy and an Earth womanalongside. These two fit together, if you follow me, to symbolise theinterbreeding. A flying saucer also hangs from the necklace and elswhere thereis a depiction of the constellation of Orion.The Sumerian Tablets and later Akkadian stories give the names and hierarchy ofthe Anunnaki. They call the ‘Father’ of the gods, AN, a word that means heaven.Our Father who art in heaven? AN, or Anu to the Akkadians, stayed mostly inheaven with his wife, Antu, and he made only rare visits to the planet theycalled E.RI.DU (Home in the faraway built), a word which evolved into Earth. Orat least that is the Zecharia Sitchin translation. The descriptions could alsoimply that Anu stayed mostly in the high mountains of the Near East where the‘Garden of Eden’, the place of the gods, is reckoned on good evidence to havebeen, and he made only rare visits to the plains of Sumer. A Sumerian city wascalled Eridu. Anu sent two sons to develop and rule the Earth, the Tablets say.They were Enki, the guy they say created homo sapiens, and his half-brotherEnlil. These two would later become great rivals for ultimate control of theplanet. Enki, the first born of Anu, was subordinate to Enlil because of theAnunnaki’s obsession with genetic purity. Enlil’s mother was the half sister toAnu and this union passed on the male genes more efficiently than Enki’s birthvia another mother. Later the Tablets describe how the Anunnaki createdbloodlines to rule humanity on their behalf and these, I suggest, are thefamilies still in control of the world to this day. The Sumerian Tabletsdescribe how kingship was granted to humanity by the Anunnaki and it wasoriginally known as Anu-ship after An or Anu, the ruler of the ‘gods’. CredoMutwa confirms all this from his own tradition and it is the true origin of theterm “the divine right of kings” – the right to rule by your bloodline. Divine =gods, not God. The Brotherhood families are obsessed with bloodlines and geneticinheritance and they interbreed without regard for love. The royal families(family!) and aristocracy of Europe and the so-called Eastern Establishmentfamilies in the United States are obvious examples of this. They are of the sametribe and genetically related. This is why the Brotherhood families have alwaysbeen obsessed with interbreeding, just as the Sumerian Tablets describe theAnunnaki. They are not interbreeding through snobbery, but to hold a geneticstructure which gives them certain abilities and connections toother-dimensional entities.The Tablets describe how humans were given the ability to procreate by Enki andthis led to an explosion in the human population which threatened to swamp theAnunnaki, who were never great in number. The Anunnaki had many internalconflicts and high-tech wars with each other, as the Enlil and Enki factionsfought for control. It is generally accepted by researchers of the Anunnaki thatEnki is on humanity’s side, but it seems to me that both groups desire dominanceover this planet, and that is their real motivatation. As Zecharia Sitchindocuments in his translations, and readers of the Indian holy books, the Vedas,will confirm, there were many accounts of the ‘gods’ going to war with eachother as they battled for supremacy. The Sumerian accounts describe how the sonsof the Annunaki ‘gods’ were most involved in these wars. These were theoffspring of Enki and Enlil, the half-brothers who became fierce rivals, andtheir sons played out that battle in a high-tech conflict, the Tablets say. Onebattle they appeared to have been involved in was the biblical destruction ofSodom and Gomorrah. These cities were probably located at the southern end ofthe Dead Sea where, today, radiation readings are much higher than normal. Thiswas when, according to the Bible, Lot’s wife looked back and was turned into apillar of salt. After referring to the original Sumerian, Zecharia Sitchin saysthat the true translation of that passage should read that Lot’s wife was turnedinto a pillar of vapour which, on balance, is rather more likely!All over the world in every native culture you will find stories of a GreatFlood and the Sumerian Tablets are no different. Sitchin says they tell how theAnunnaki left the planet in flying craft, as an enormous surge of water wipedout much of humanity. There is no doubt that an unimaginable catastrophe, ormore likely catastrophes, were visited upon the Earth between approximately11,000 and 4,000 BC. The geological and biological evidence is overwhelming inits support of the countless stories and traditions which describe such events.They come from Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Africa, throughout the Americancontinent, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, China, Japan and the Middle East.Everywhere. Some speak of great heat which boiled the sea; of mountainsbreathing fire; the disappearance of the Sun and Moon and the darkness thatfollowed; the raining down of blood, ice and rock; the Earth flipping over; thesky falling; the rising and sinking of land; the loss of a great continent; thecoming of the ice; and virtually all of them describe a fantastic flood, a wallof water, which swept across the Earth. The tidal wave caused by the comet inthe film, Deep Impact, gives you an idea of what it would have been like. OldChinese texts describe how the pillars supporting the sky crumbled; of how theSun, Moon and stars poured down in the north-west, where the sky became low;rivers, seas and oceans rushed to the south-east where the Earth sank and agreat conflagration was quenched by a raging flood. In America, the PawneeIndians tell the same story of a time when the north and south polar starschanged places and went to visit each other. North American traditions refer togreat clouds appearing and a heat so powerful that the waters boiled. TheGreenland Eskimos told early missionaries that long ago the Earth turned over.Peruvian legend says that the Andes were split apart when the sky made war withthe Earth. Brazilian myth describes how the heavens burst and fragments felldown killing everything and everyone as heaven and Earth changed places. And theHopi Indians of North America record that: “the Earth was rent in great chasms,and water covered everything except one narrow ridge of mud”.9[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88455][../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 3: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the centre of earthquake and volcanic activityin the area of the Atlantic Ocean where Plato apparently placed Atlantis.All of this closely correlates with the legends of Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria:two vast continents, one in the Atlantic and the other in the Pacific, whichmany people believe were ruled by highly advanced races. The continents are saidto have disappeared under the sea in the circumstances described above, leavingonly islands like the Azores as remnants of their former scale and glory.Atlantis was described by Plato (427–347 BC), the ancient Greek philosopher andhigh initiate of the secret society-mystery school network. To this day thissecret network has passed on much knowledge to the chosen few while denying thatprivilege to the mass of the people. Official history dismisses Plato’scontention that such a continent existed and there are apparent historicaldiscrepancies in his accounts (according to official history), but there isgeological support for his basic theme. The Azores, which some believe were partof Atlantis, lie on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is connected to a fracture linethat encircles the planet (see Figure 3). This line continues for a distance of40,000 miles. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is one of the foremost areas forearthquakes and volcanoes. Four vast tectonic plates, the Eurasian, African,North American and Caribbean, all meet and collide in this region making it veryunstable geologically. Both the Azores and the Canary Islands (named after dogs‘canine’ and not canaries!), were subject to widespread volcanic activity in thetime period Plato suggested for the end of Atlantis. Tachylite lavadisintegrates in sea water within 15,000 years and yet it is still found on thesea bed around the Azores, confirming geologically-recent upheavals.10[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88769] Other evidence, including beach sandgathered from depths of 10,500–18,440 feet, reveals that the seabed in thisregion must have been, again geologically-recently, above sea level.11[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88859] The oceanographer, Maurice Ewing,wrote in National Geographic magazine that: “Either the land must have sunk twoor three miles, or the sea must once have been two or three miles lower thannow. Either conclusion is startling.”12[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos88949]The geological and biological evidence also suggests that the widespreadvolcanic activity which caused the sinking of the land in the region of theAzores, happened at the same time as the break up and sinking of the land massknown as Appalachia which connected what we now call Europe, North America,Iceland and Greenland.13 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89154] Even theirdegree of submergence appear closely related. Similar evidence can be producedto support the view that the continent known as Mu or Lemuria now rests on thebed of the Pacific.14 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89278] The so-calledBermuda Triangle between Bermuda, southern Florida, and a point near theAntilles, has long been associated with Atlantis. It is also an area steeped inlegends of disappearing ships and aircraft. Submerged buildings, walls, roadsand stone circles like Stonehenge, even what appear to be pyramids, have beenlocated near Bimini, under the waters of the Bahama Banks and within the‘triangle’.15 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89368] So have walls or roadscreating intersecting lines.16 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89546] Someother facts that most people don’t know: the Himalayas, the Alps and the Andes,only reached anything like their present height around 11,000–13,000 yearsago.17 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89630] Lake Titicaca on thePeru-Bolivia border is today the highest navigable lake in the world at some12,500 feet. Around 13,000 years ago, much of that region was at sea level! Whyare so many fish and other ocean fossils found high up in mountain ranges?Because those mountains were once at sea level. Recently so in geological terms,too. There is increasing acceptance that the Earth has suffered some colossalgeological upheavals. The debate (and often hostility) comes with the questionsof when and why. These upheavals have obviously involved the solar system as awhole because every planet shows evidence of some cataclysmic events which haveaffected either its surface, atmosphere, speed and angle of orbit or rotation. Ithink the themes of the Sumerian Tablets are correct, but I doubt some of theirdetail, not least because of the vast period that passed between 450,000 yearsago when the Anunnaki are said to have arrived, and the time, only a fewthousand years ago, when these accounts were written down. There was certainlyan enormous cataclysm on the Earth around 11,000 BC which destroyed the advancedcivilisations of the high-tech Golden Age and that date of 13,000 years ago ishighly significant and very relevant to the time we are living through now. Justas the planets of the solar system revolve around the Sun, so the solar systemrevolves around the centre of the galaxy. It appears that we are reaching alife-changing point in that and other cycles. Interestingly, it was 13,000 yearsago that the Golden Age would appear to have concluded in cataclysm andconflict, and today, with another 13,000 year cycle of ‘darkness’ reaching itsconclusion, there is a rapid global spiritual awakening and incredible eventsand awakenings await us in the next few years. We are entering the light again.So there was a fantastic cataclysm around 13,000 years ago which brought an endto the high-tech civilisations of the Golden Age. But was it the only one? Theevidence suggests not.A friend of mine in California, Brian Desborough, is a researcher and scientistI have great respect for. He has been involved in aerospace research and hasbeen employed in this and other scientific research by many companies. Brian isa feeton-the-ground guy who looks at all the evidence and goes where it, ratherthan convention, takes him. He has compiled some highly detailed and compellinginformation about the ancient world and its connection to the Brotherhoodmanipulation of today. While he worked for a major United States corporation inthe 1960s, their physicists completed their own independent studies whichsuggested that about 4,800 BC a huge body, which we now know as Jupiter,careered into our solar system. The outer planets were thrown into disarray andJupiter eventually crashed into a planet which orbited between the presentJupiter and Mars. The physicists said the remains of this planet became theasteroid belt and that part of Jupiter broke away to become what we now callVenus. As Venus, then a vast chunk of matter, was projected into space, itdestroyed the atmosphere and life of Mars before it was caught by the Earth’sgravitational field, the study claimed. Venus made several orbits of the Earthbefore its momentum hurled it into its current position in the solar system. Itwas those orbits, the physicists said, that brought devastation and a tidal waveabout 4,800 BC. They believed, as Brian Desborough does, that before this timeMars orbited where the Earth is now and the Earth was closer to the Sun. Thebrilliant light of Venus as it passed close to the Earth may have led to theidea of Lucifer, the ‘light bringer’. The most ancient Mesopotamian and CentralAmerican records do not include Venus in their planetary accounts, only laterdoes it appear. There was an obsession with Venus in many cultures, with humansacrifices being made to it.The unofficial study by the physicists has never been published, but let usconsider the evidence for some of its claims. When you sprinkle particles on avibrating plate you can recreate the planetary orbits of the solar system. Whenvibratory waves moving outward from the plate’s centre meet waves moving in theother direction, a so-called standing wave is formed as the two collide. Thiscauses the particles to build up and create a series of concentric circles.These will be equally spaced if single frequencies collide with each other, butif, as with the solar system, a spectrum of frequencies are involved, thecircles will be unequally spaced in accordance with the vibrational pressures.Place an object on these vibrating circles of particles and it will begin toorbit the centre of the plate, carried by the energy flow caused by thevibrational interactions. Heavier objects placed anywhere on the plate will bedrawn to one of these concentric circles and these objects will themselves formwave patterns around themselves which will attract lighter objects to them. Inour solar system, the most powerful waves are being emitted from the centre bythe Sun, obviously, because that represents 99% of the matter in the solarsystem. These waves from the Sun interact with other cosmic waves, so forming aseries of standing waves which, in turn, form concentric circles or vibrationalfields orbiting the Sun. The heaviest bodies, the planets, are caught in thesecircles and thus orbit the Sun. The planets also create less powerful wavecircles around themselves and these can attract lighter bodies which orbit them.The Moon orbiting the Earth is an example of this. So anything that woulddisturb this harmony of vibrational interaction would affect these concentriccircles of energy and, if this was powerful enough, change the orbit of planets.What the physicists say happened with Jupiter and Venus would certainly bepowerful enough to do this. These circles of standing waves exist around the Sunin relation to the vibrational pressures involved and they do not need a planetto exist. They exist anyway and a planetary body merely locks into them.Therefore there are many more of these vibrational ‘roadways’ in the solarsystem than there are planets, and if a planet or body is ejected from its orbitit will eventually lock into another wave, another orbit, when its momentumslows enough to be captured. This, Desborough believes, is what happened whenthe fantastic vibrational pressures of the Venus ‘comet’ passed close to Marsand the Earth and hurled them into different orbits.Venus would have been an ice-coated ‘comet’, Desborough says, and the ice wouldhave disintegrated when Venus approached the Earth and reached a point known asthe Roche Limit.18 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos89753] This is avibrational safety device, if you like. When two bodies are on collision course,the one with the smallest mass starts to disintegrate at the Roche Limit. Inthis case, the ice would have been projected from Venus’s surface towards theEarth. Also, as it entered the so-called Van Allen Belt, which absorbs much ofthe dangerous radiation from the Sun, the ice would have been ionised –magnetised – and therefore attracted to the Earth’s magnetic poles.19[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90032] Billions of tons of ice, cooled to-273 degrees centigrade, would have fallen on the polar regions, flash-freezingeverything in little more than an instant.20[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90116] This, at last, would explain themystery of the mammoths found frozen where they stood. The mammoth, contrary tobelief, was not a cold region animal, but one which lived in temperategrasslands. Somehow those temperate regions were frozen in a moment. Somemammoths have been found frozen in the middle of eating! There you are munchingaway and the next thing you know you’re an ice lolly. If this ionised ice didrain down from Venus, the biggest build up would have been nearest to themagnetic poles because they would have had the most powerful attraction. Again,that is the case. The ice mass in the polar regions is greater at the poles thanat the periphery and yet there is less snow and rain at the poles to create sucha build up.21 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90200] The Venus scenarioexplains this. In the Book of Job, which is believed to be an Arab work mucholder than the rest of the Bible, the question is asked: “Whence cometh theice?” I would say we could have the answer. This further explains how theancients could have had maps of what the north and south poles looked likebefore the ice was there. The poles were ice-free until about 7,000 years ago.There was no ice age as officially suggested. It’s another illusion. When youlook at the ‘evidence’ that official science presents to support theconventional idea of an ice age and the way this ‘evidence’ is fundamentallycontradicted by the provable facts, it is astonishing how such nonsense couldbecome conventional ‘truth’ in the first place.22[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90284] Before this incredible cataclysm,and/or one of the others, the Earth had a uniform tropical climate, asfossilised plants have shown. This would have been changed not only by thearrival of the ice on the surface, but also by the destruction of a canopy ofwater vapour around the Earth, as described in Genesis and other ancient texts.Credo Mutwa’s accounts include the same descriptions from the African tradition.This canopy would have ensured a uniform tropical climate everywhere, butsuddenly it was gone.The dramatic change in temperature at the poles would have collided with thewarm air and caused devastating winds, exactly as described by Chinese folklore.The physicists said that the pressures created by the orbits of ‘Venus’ aroundthe Earth would have produced a 10,000 foot tidal wave in the oceans and thisagain fits with the evidence that agriculture began at altitudes of 10,000 feetand higher. Plato wrote in his work, Laws, that agriculture began at highelevations after a gigantic flood covered all the lowlands. The botanist,Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov, studied more than 50,000 wild plants collectedaround the world and found that they originated in only eight different areas –all of them mountain terrain.23 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90466] Thetidal wave would have produced pressures on the Earth’s surface of two tons persquare inch, creating new mountain ranges, and fossilising everything withinhours.24 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90575] Artificial stone today iscreated by pressures of this magnitude. Intact trees have been found fossilisedand that would be impossible unless it happened in an instant because the treewould normally have disintegrated before it could be fossilised over a longperiod of time.25 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90659] In fact, fossilsof this kind are not forming today.26[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90743] They are the result of thecataclysmic events here described, Desborough says. The Russian-Jewishpsychiatrist and writer, Immanuel Velikovsky, caused outrage among thescientific establishment in the 1950s by suggesting that the Earth had beenthrough enormous upheavals when Venus which was then, he said, a comet, careeredthrough this part of the solar system before settling into its present orbit.When Venus was photographed by the Mariner 10 mission, many of Velikovsky’sdescriptions proved correct, including what appeared to be the remnants of acometlike tail. The Mariner 9 pictures of Mars also supported some ofVelikovsky’s theories. He said that the ‘comet’ Venus had collided with Mars asit careered through the solar system. Velikovsky’s time for these events wasabout 1,500 BC. Different researchers dismiss each other’s findings because theysuggest very different periods for major upheavals when in truth there werealmost certainly a number of cataclysms in that window of 11,000 to 1,500 BC,and even more recently. The study by the physicists also said that Mars wasdevastated by these events involving Venus. They felt Mars was thrown out oforbit and followed a highly unstable elliptical orbit which took it between theEarth and the Moon every 56 years.27 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90827]The last of these passes appears to have been about 1,500 BC when the greatvolcano exploded on the Greek island of Santorini and the Minoan civilisation onCrete passed into history. In this same period of 1,600–1,500 BC, ocean levelsdropped about 20 per cent, glacial lakes formed in California, and this was mostlikely the time when the vast lake in the fertile Sahara was emptied and thedesert we see today began to be formed.28[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90911] Eventually, Mars settled into itspresent orbit, but by then life on its surface had been obliterated. Yet againthe evidence on Mars supports all this. The Mars Pathfinder mission found thatMartian rocks lack sufficient erosion to have been on the surface for more than10,000 years.29 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos90995]Brian Desborough believes, like the physicists he knew and worked with, that theEarth was once nearer the Sun than it is today and that Mars orbited where theEarth now resides. If, as is claimed, the deep canyons on Mars’s surface werecaused by massive torrents of water, there had to have been a warmer climate onMars, because today it is so cold that water would freeze instantly and thenear-vacuum atmosphere would make the water instantly vaporise.30[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91079] Desborough says that the Earth’scloser proximity to the Sun demanded that the first Earth humans were the blackraces with the pigmentation to cope with the much fiercer rays of the Sun.Ancient skeletons found near Stonehenge in England and along the west coast ofFrance display the nasal and spinal characteristics of many female Africans.31[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91163] Desborough says that Mars, then witha climate very much like ours, had a white race before the Venus cataclysm. Hisresearch has convinced him that the white Martians built the pyramids which havebeen recorded on Mars and they went to war with an advanced black race toconquer the Earth. These wars, he says, are the wars of the ‘gods’ described inendless ancient texts, not least the Hindu Vedas. This could relate to the timeof Atlantis. Desborough adds that after the cataclysm, the white Martians whohad settled on Earth were stranded here without their technology and with theirhome planet devastated. These white Martians, he says, became the white peoplesof the Earth. Fascinatingly, some scientists claim that when white people areimmersed in sensory deprivation tanks for long periods, their circadian rhythmhas a frequency of 24 hours 37 minutes, which corresponds not to the rotationalperiod of the Earth, but of Mars!32 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91247]This is not the case with non-white races who are in tune with the Earth’srotation. Desborough believes that these white Martians were the highly advancedrace of the ancient world known as the Phoenicians or Aryans and they began thelong process of returning to their former technological power after theupheavals which destroyed the surface of their own planet and devastated thisone. My own research supports this basic theme, although, like everyone seekingthe truth of what happened, I have many questions. A white race, known as thePhoenicians and other names, was certainly the ‘brains’ behind the Egyptiancivilisation, at least from the period around 3,000 BC, and the Giza Plateau,where the Great Pyramid was built, was formerly known as El-Kahira, a name whichderived from the Arabic noun, El-Kahir, their name for… Mars.33[../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91331] For a long time the Sphinx waspainted red, the colour associated with Mars. The Egyptians used to call Mars,Hor Dshr, or ‘Horus the Red’. It was also known as Horakhti or ‘Eastern Star’and the east-facing Sphinx was also known as Horakhti or… Mars, according toresearchers. The Sphinx is apparently part man, part lion, and ancient Hindumyths (inspired by the same white race that inspired Egypt) refer to Mars as the‘man-lion’. (There are some who believe the face of the Sphinx is actually awoman.) All over the world ancient cultures had a fascination with Mars. I wouldstrongly suggest that this emphasis on Mars came from the knowledge in ancienttimes that this is where the white race had come from. I would say that theevidence is building rapidly that Mars was destroyed by the same cataclysmicevents which caused the enormous geological upheavels on Earth in the window of11,000 BC to 5,000 BC and that the same white Martian peoples who built thepyramids on Mars and non-natural features such as the Sphinx-like ‘face’ werethe same peoples who later built the Sphinx and pyramids at Giza and other greatstructures, including Stonehenge and Avebury in England. We will see moreevidence for this as we continue. Ancient texts reveal that the measurement oftime was much related to Mars, and March 15th, the Ides of March (Mars), was akey date in their Mars-related calendar, as was October 26th. The first markedthe start of Spring and the second was the end of the year in the Celticcalendar.34 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91415] The Holy Grail storiesof King Arthur connect with this theme, also. Camelot apparently means MartianCity or City of Mars.35 [../Text/index_split_011.html#filepos91592] Scientificevidence, much of it suppressed or not ‘emphasised’, has shown without questionthat Mars had rainfall, oceans, lakes and rivers, a strong magnetic field and anatmosphere that could have supported life as we know it on Earth. It is alsobeyond question that Mars, as a home for such life, was destroyed by a fantasticcataclysm in which it was struck or bombarded by an object or objects of anenormous size. And the gathering indications are that all this happened veryrecently, certainly in the last 20,000 years. An excellent summary of thisevidence can be found in Graham Hancock’s book with Robert Bauval and JohnGrigsby called The Mars Mystery (Penguin Books, London, 1998).I think there is truth in all the views summarised in this chapter of thecataclysmic upheavals the Earth has suffered in the period between 11,000 and1,500 BC. The first one ended the Golden Age and obliterated the high-techcivilisations that had existed before then. Or maybe it was destroyed in stages.The extraterrestrial races either left the planet beforehand or survived at highaltitudes or by going deep within the Earth. The same with the later cataclysms.Many of the extraterrestrials, and most Earth humans, did not survive theseevents. Those that did were left with the job of starting all over againwithout, at least at first, the technology available before. The survivors fellinto two main categories, those of mostly extraterrestrial origin who retainedthe advanced knowledge, and humans, the slave race in general, who did not. Theformer also fell into two camps. There were those who wished to use theirknowledge positively and communicate their information to humanity, and thosewho sought to hoard the knowledge and use it to manipulate and control. Thestruggle between those two groups over the use of the same knowledge continuesto this very day. As societies recovered from those upheavals of 11,000 BC, theother cataclysms brought more devastation over the thousands of years thatfollowed and humanity was faced with many new beginnings.One common theme throughout, however, has been the manipulation of humanity byan intellectually, though not spiritually, advanced race or races ofextraterrestrial origin. On that subject, I must now introduce an addeddimension to this story which will stretch your credulity to breaking point."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_010.html#filepos39024] T.

I wish I didn’t have to introduce the followinginformation because it complicates the story and opens me up to mass ridicule.But stuff it. If that is where the evidence takes me, that is where I shall goevery time.I don’t think the Anunnaki of the Sumerian Tablets and the white Martiansproposed in Brian Desborough’s scenario are the same people, although there maywell be a genetic connection between them. Putting together the mass ofevidence, views, research and opinions, that I have read or heard almost dailythese past years, I feel the Anunnaki are a race from a reptile genetic stream.In UFO research these have become known as reptilians. Nor am I alone in thisview. I have personally been staggered by how many people today are open tothese possibilities and, indeed, are coming to the same conclusions throughtheir own research. These include many who would have laughed at the very ideanot so long ago. Dr Arthur David Horn, a former professor of biologicalanthropology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, once believedemphatically in the Darwinist version of human evolution, the slow developmentof the human species via the principle of the survival of the fittest. Purely onthe weight of evidence and his own experience, he is now convinced that humanitywas seeded by extraterrestrials and that a reptilian race has controlled theplanet for thousands of years and continues to do so today. This is my own view,although I have taken a very different life path to reach those sameconclusions. Dr Horn’s research is detailed in his excellent book, Humanity’sExtraterrestrial Origins1 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos204919] in whichhe suggests that the ones the Sumerian Tablets call the Anunnaki are thisreptile race, another point with which we agree. The famed Britishastrophysicist, Fred Hoyle, told a London press conference as long ago as 1971that the world was controlled by a force which could manifest in many forms.“They are everywhere,” he told astonished journalists, “in the sky, in the seaand on the Earth…” He said that ‘they’ controlled humanity through the mind. Iknow this sounds utterly bizarre, but you need to read the whole of The BiggestSecret to see the wealth of evidence to support this. If you pull out now orafter a couple of chapters because your belief system is in overload, that’syour choice, but you will miss the opportunity to see that the almosthysterically unbelievable is actually true.The more I weave together incredible amounts of information, the more it seemsto me that we are talking of two distinct situations running side by side. Therewere other extraterrestrial races at large on the Earth, and still are, as wellas the extraterrestrial race which the Sumerians called the Anunnaki and otherancient texts called the Serpent Race. It could well have been that some of theothers went to war with this reptilian Anunnaki. Ancient texts record these‘wars of the gods’ all over the world and these could include conflicts betweendifferent extraterrestrial races as well as those described in the SumerianTablets that appeared to involve Anunnaki factions fighting with each other.Today there are many modern accounts from people who claim to have seenhumanoid-type people whose skin and faces look like lizards and frogs with largeprotruding eyes. Jason Bishop III (a pseudonym), an investigator of theextraterrestrial phenomenon, says that the reptilians are mostly much tallerthan humans and are cold blooded like Earth reptiles.2[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205197] They appear to be far lessemotionally sensitive than humans and most have great difficulty expressinglove, though they are extremely intelligent and have very advanced technology. Imust say that is an excellent description of the attitudes and behaviour of theBrotherhood who control the world today. The modern accounts of reptilians matchthe descriptions of many ‘gods’ of the ancient world in the surviving texts andlegends. The Ubaid culture existed between 5,000 and 4,000 BC, even beforeSumer, in what is now Iraq and figurines of their gods are clear representationsof reptile-like, lizard-like humanoids. You can see a lizard Ubaid figurineholding a lizard baby in the picture section. The region where the Ubaid-Sumercultures emerged is fundamental to this whole story and the Ubaid figurinesdepict physically the descriptions of ‘gods’ which dominated many ancientsocieties. The Central American cultures had their winged serpent god,Quetzalcoatl; the Hopi Indians had the plumed serpent god, Baholinkonga, and theNative American culture is awash with serpent imagery, including the mysteriousserpent-shaped mound in Ohio; the East Indians speak of the reptilian gods, theNagas (these were a race of ‘demons’ in Indian legend and their name means“Those who do not walk, but creep”); the Egyptians had their serpent god, Kneph,and pharaohs were often pictured with serpents; the Phoenicians had Agathodemon,another serpent figure; the voodoo people have a god they call Damballah Wedo,who is depicted as a serpent; and the Hebrews had Nakhustan, the Brazen Serpent.The ancient British god, known as the Dragon-Ruler of the World, was called HUand from this, very appropriately I would suggest, we get the term, Hu-man. Thewinged-disc symbol of the Sumerians, which is found all over the ancient world,was normally featured with two serpents. The symbolism of the serpent and itsassociation with ancient ‘gods’ abounds throughout the world. The Reverend JohnBathhurst Deane in his book The Worship Of The Serpent, 3[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205382] wrote:“…One of (the) five builders of Thebes (in Egypt) was named after theserpent-god of the Phoenicians, Ofhion… The first altar erected to Cyclops atAthens, was to ‘Ops’, the serpent-deity… The symbolic worship of the serpent wasso common in Greece, that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing itinto the mysteries of all their gods. The Chinese... are said to besuperstitious in choosing a plot of ground to erect a dwelling house orsepulchre: conferring it with the head, tail and feet of diverse dragons whichlive under the Earth.”Credo Mutwa, the Zulu sanusi, or shaman, has detailed his astonishing knowledgeof the reptilian control in two videos recorded with me, The Reptilian Agendaparts one and two, and a book published by David Icke Books, Children Of TheMatrix. Calling on nearly 80 years of learning the suppressed history of Africa,Credo tells the story of the Chitauri, the reptilian race, he says, are the sameas the Annunaki. He tells how they have controlled humanity for thousands ofyears and how they are the ruling bloodlines of the world today. It is the mostfantastic confirmation of the themes of this book, all of which were writtenbefore I talked to Credo about this subject. He has painted a picture of whatthe Chitauri look like from ancient and modern accounts and you can see that inthe picture section. Credo says there are so few literal depictions of thereptilian ‘gods’ because the people were told that they would die if they everrevealed what they really looked like. Instead the people used symbols ofsnakes, crocodiles and so on, and of fish because of the scales! The Chitauriwere known, he says, as the Children of the Python or Children of the Serpent.You see serpent or python symbolism in every corner of the world, including onthe headgear worn by Egyptian pharoahs. Credo says that some of the serpent racehave domed heads and this is why there are native peoples in Africa andelsewhere who still seek to shape the heads of their children into domes, usingsome horrendous techniques from birth, because then they “look like to gods”.You also see this domed head in Egyptian depictions, and elsewhere.The idea of fire breathing dragons and evil serpents which appear in legends andtexts all over the world originates from the reptilian ‘gods’ who once operatedopenly thousands of years ago. These were the Serpent People of ancient texts,including the Bible, where the serpent is a regular theme. Of course, theserpent has been used to symbolise many things and not every reference will beliterally a reptile, certainly not. But many of them are. There is also a commontheme of a sacred place being guarded by a serpent or dragon. We have theserpent in the Garden of Eden and the serpent/dragon theme is global. ThePersians spoke of a region of bliss and delight called Heden which was morebeautiful than all the rest of the world. It was the original abode of the firstmen, they said, before they were tempted by the evil spirit, in the form of aserpent, to partake of the fruit of the forbidden tree. There is also the BanyonTree under which the Hindu ‘Jesus’, known as Krishna, sat upon a coiled serpentand bestowed spiritual knowledge on humanity. The ancient Greeks had a traditionof the Islands of the Blessed and the Garden of the Hesperides in which grew atree bearing the golden apples of immortality. This garden was protected by adragon.4 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205559] In the Chinese sacredbooks there is a garden in which grew trees bearing the fruit of immortality andit, too, was guarded by a winged serpent called a dragon. In ancient Mexicanaccounts, their version of the Eve story involves a great male serpent.5[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205662] Another Hindu legend speaks of thesacred mountain of Meru guarded by a dreadful dragon.6[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205751] Over and over we see the same themeof sacred places guarded by fearsome dragons and of a reptilian or a halfreptile-half human, giving spiritual knowledge to humans.The reptile species has a long, long connection with the Earth, going back morethan 150 million years to the dinosaurs and beyond. If we are to understand thetrue nature of life we need to free our minds from the bonds of conditioning andrealise that what we see around us on Earth is only a tiny fraction ofpossibility. The cosmologist Carl Sagan said there are more possiblecombinations of DNA (physical forms) than there are atoms in the universe! Thereptile species, like lizards and snakes, are but one form of the reptiliangenetic stream in this universe. While the dinosaurs were not all cold-bloodedreptiles, as modern research has shown, the reptiles and dinosaurs are closelyrelated by physical appearance alone and both have spawned an amazing variety ofdifferent forms. The dinosaurs manifested as everything from flying creatures,large and small, to the eight-ton, Tyrannosaurus Rex. Are we really saying thatreptile-dinosaur genetic streams that can produce such diversity, cannotmanifest in a two-legged, two-armed form with a brain capacity through which atechnically advanced consciousness can operate? More recently a greaterunderstanding of the dinosaurs has revealed that many were very intelligent ahundred million years ago. The Saurornithoides, named from its appearance as abird-like reptile, had a large brain, wide-set eyes that gave it stereoscopicvision, and fingers with opposing thumbs which allowed it to catch and eat smallmammals.7 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos205840] Adrian J. Desmond, one ofthe world’s leading researchers into dinosaurs, says that creatures like theSaurornithoides, were separated from other dinosaurs “by a gulf comparable tothat dividing men from cows”.8 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206046] Heasks: “Who knows what peaks the sophisticated ‘bird-mimics’ would have attainedhad they survived?”9 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206129] Studies havesuggested that had the dinosaurs not been wiped out by yet another cataclysmabout 65 million years ago, they would have evolved into a reptile humanoid bynow.10 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206212] Dale Russell, the seniorpaleontologist at Northern California University, was asked by the US spaceagency, NASA, to produce a report on what extraterrestrial life might looklike.11 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206386] He evolved the Troodondinosaur in line with natural genetic changes over millions of years and createda model of a being he dubbed a Dino-sauroid. This had a remarkable resemblanceto a reptilian humanoid and was identical to those described by people who claimto have seen reptile extraterrestrials. Who is to say that this evolutionaryleap from classic dinosaurs to reptilian humanoids did not happen in anotherdimension or on another physical planet and perhaps on Earth before thedinosaurs were eliminated? In fact, were they all eliminated? Modernpalaeontology (the study of fossils) now suggests that not all the dinosaurswere killed by the meteorite strike 65 million years ago and some continue tolive today. More and more evidence is emerging that birds are descendants of thedinosaurs. And while the bodies of most dinosaurs might have been destroyed,their consciousness would have survived because consciousness is energy andenergy is indestructible. It can only be transmuted into a different form. Whathappened to that dinosaur consciousness that dominated the Earth for 150 millionyears? As we’ve seen, the earliest accounts of Assyria, Babylon, Old Testamenthistory, China, Rome, America, Africa, India and elsewhere, feature stories ofthe dragons. The serpent symbol has also been found in ancient Britain, Greece,Malta, Egypt, New Mexico, Peru and all over the Pacific Islands. There is anunmistakable resemblance between some dinosaurs and ancient depictions ofdragons. Several species of small Indo-Malayan lizards with webbed wings look somuch like dragons that they have been given the name Draco after the starconstellation from which the reptilian hierarchy are said to originate. Of evenmore interest to me is the armoured lizard called Moloch Horridus which also hasa dragon-like appearance. Moloch is an ancient deity to which children weresacrificed thousands of years ago and still are today in the vast Satanic ritualnetwork. They are sacrificed to the reptilians in other words because, as willbecome clear, many ‘demons’of Satanism are the reptilians who have sought totake over the planet for thousands of years. Charles Gould who has writtenextensively about dragons and reptiles, says: “there is a lost species of lizardhibernating and carnivorous which had Draco-like wings and was protected byarmour and spikes”.12 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206599] He believesits habitat was the highlands of central Asia and its disappearance coincidedwith the Great Flood.13 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206721] But thereare still sightings of giant ‘flying lizards’ in remote areas of the world,especially in Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona.[../Images/00012.jpg]Figure 4: The Draco ‘dragon’ constellation to which so many ancient monumentsappear to be aligned.Who are they and where do they come from?There are three suggested origins for the Anunnaki reptilian intervention inhuman affairs: 1 They are extraterrestrials; 2 They are ‘inner’ terrestrials wholive within the Earth; 3 They manipulate humanity from another dimension by‘possessing’ human bodies. I think they are all true.Extraterrestrials?Researchers into the reptilian phenomenon conclude that at least some originatein the Draco star constellation (see Figure 4). The Draco system includes thestar Thurban, once the North Star, by which the Egyptian pyramids areorientated.14 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206805] As I mentionedearlier, the Sumerians apparently saw the Draco star system as the dragon andcalled it Tiamat. According to the research of author Graham Hancock and others,the ancient temple complex at Angkor Wat in Cambodia is a replica of the Dracoconstellation as it would have been in 10,500 BC.15[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos206986] But to be fair other authoritieshave seriously challenged this idea in a British television documentary. 10,500BC is a time much focussed upon by Hancock and his associates. This is the timewhen the Earth and its people, human and extraterrestrial, would have beenrecovering from the cataclysm of 11,000 BC and rebuilding their civilisation.The author and researcher, Robert Bauval, says that the pyramids at Giza alignwith the stars on the ‘belt’ of Orion as they would have been in 10,500 BC whenOrion was at the lowest point in its cycle (the Orions are anotherextraterrestrial race operating on this planet, I understand, and thisconstellation is connected to the reptilians too. The Orion stars appear onCredo Mutwa’s ‘necklace’). Hancock and other researchers suggest that thelion-bodied Sphinx at Giza, which is believed to be far older than originallydated, would have directly faced the constellation of Leo the lion at that sametime, 10,500 BC. Its connections with Mars are extremely relevant also. Researchcontinues under the ocean off Japan into a fantastic structure which could alsodate to 10,500 BC at least. There are many who have questioned these findings,especially the synchronisation of the Giza pyramids to Orion, but at the veryleast they have triggered an important area of investigation, even if they provenot to be accurate in every detail. After all, finding the truth, especially sofar back, is hardly easy. It is certainly astonishing how the ancient structuresand temples, of apparently unconnected societies all over the world, align witheach other with fantastic astronomical, mathematical and geometrical precision.But then, these societies were not unconnected. As we shall see, they had thesame origins. The temples at Angkor Wat are covered in reptilian images, afeature of all the ancient cultures, including the Egyptian, the CentralAmerican and the Indian. Professor Phillip Calahan in his study of the survivingand mysterious round towers of Ireland has said that they are positioned withremarkable synchronicity to the star constellations of the northern sky at thewinter solstice. And the towers most perfectly align with the constellation of…Draco. The head and eyes of the Draco formation, as designed on the ground inIreland, are, according to Calahan, located either side of Lough Neagh right inthe centre of Northern Ireland. The eastern side of Lough Neagh is close to thecapital, Belfast.16 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207152] So the head ofthe Draco constellation is positioned on the ground in Northern Ireland and thatsmall country has been the scene of so much upheaval, murder and suffering. Bythe end of this book, those who are new to these concepts will appreciate thepower of symbolism to attract energy to a place, negative and positive. JohnRhodes,17 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207334] one of the foremost ofthe researchers into the reptilian presence, says that they may be spaceinvaders who move from planet to planet, covertly infiltrating the host societyand eventually taking over. The reptilian military, it is said, carry outabductions of life forms while their scientists study the biology and introducethe reptilian genetic code into species they wish to manipulate. This involves aprogramme of crossbreeding and that is precisely what the Sumerian Texts aredescribing in relation to the Anunnaki. Rhodes adds that:“From their underground bases, the reptilian military ETs…(establish)…a networkof human-reptilian crossbreed infiltrates within various levels of the surfaceculture’s military industrial complexes, government bodies, UFO/paranormalgroups, religious and fraternal (priest) orders, etc. These crossbreeds, someunaware of their reptilian genetic “mind control” instructions, act out theirsubversive roles as “reptilian agents”, setting the stage for a reptilian-led ETinvasion.”18 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207503]I only came across the work of John Rhodes in the last few days before this bookwas complete and by then, as you will see later in the detailed text, I hadreached exactly the same conclusions. Rhodes says that after the reptiliansinvade a planet from space and from their underground bases, the surfacepopulation quickly surrender to superior weaponry. Then the reptilians strip theplanet of its resources like water, minerals and DNA information. Theinfiltration of human society via secret societies is a key method of reptiliancontrol, as I shall detail. The American writer and researcher, William Bramley,concluded in his book, Gods Of Eden, that the Anunnaki created a secret societycalled the Brotherhood of the Snake and this has been used to manipulatehumanity in the way described in the chapters that follow.19[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207618] This Brotherhood of the Snake isthe core centre of today’s global secret society network which is controlled bythe reptilians.Inner-terrestrials?In their physical expression, the Anunnaki are one of the many inner-Earth raceswhich live underground in the enormous catacombs, caverns and tunnels below thesurface. A Hopi Indian legend says that a very ancient tunnel complex existsunder Los Angeles and this, they say, was occupied by a ‘lizard’ race some 5,000years ago. In 1933 G. Warren Shufelt, an LA mining engineer, claimed to havefound it.20 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207757] Today, it is said, somemalevolent Freemasonic rituals are held in this tunnel complex. There has been amassive cover up by the authorities of the existence of these subterranean racesand where they live. In 1909 a subterranean city which was built with theprecision of the Great Pyramid was found by G. E. Kincaid near the Grand Canyonin Arizona. It was big enough to accommodate 50,000 people and mummified bodiesfound on the site were of oriental or possibly Egyptian origin, according to theexpedition leader Professor S. A. Jordan.21[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos207884] Numerous artefacts were found,including copper implements as hard as steel. The Smithsonian Institution inWashington DC has ensured these finds remain unknown to the public (that’s itsjob!) and no-one would have known about this discovery had it not been for twoarticles in a local newspaper, the Arizona Gazette, in April 1909. Theresearcher and author, John Rhodes, claims to have located this site and heconnects it with Sipapuni, the underground world from where the Hopi Indiansclaim to have originated. According to their legends, the Hopi once lived withinthe Earth and were fed and clothed by ‘ant people’, possibly theextraterrestrials known as the Greys. The Hopi refer to their ancestors as their‘snake brothers’ and their most sacred of underground rituals is the snakedance. As I will keep emphasising, not all reptilians are of malevolent intentand I have no wish to demonise the reptile stream. We are talking here only ofone group of them. The Hopi say that one day under the orders of their goddess,Spider Woman, they ascended to the surface of the Earth and emerged throughtheir cave they called the Sipapuni. Once on the outside, the Hopi say, amocking bird arrived to confuse their language and make different tribes speakdifferent tongues. This is such a repeat of the biblical story of the Tower ofBabel that a connection is obvious and, as Credo Mutwa explains, the same storyis told in Africa. To this day the Hopi will not recreate the images of theirsnake ancestors for fear of death – exactly what Credo Mutwa said aboutAfricans. The layout of the underground world discovered in Arizona wasdescribed by G. E. Kincaid as a “…mammoth chamber from which radiates scores ofpassageways like the spokes of a wheel”. This is also how the modern reptilianunderground base at Dulce, New Mexico is described, and concentric circles ofpeople, compartmentalising different levels of knowledge, is the structure bywhich the global Brotherhood manipulate the world. Arizona, New Mexico and theFour Corners area where the states of Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico allmeet, are some of the most important regions on Earth for reptilian undergroundbases. But underground worlds and cities, ancient and modern, abound all overthe planet. There are eyewitness reports of giant humanoids sighted in the HalSaflini catacombs in Malta during the 1930s, which were closed after a party ofschoolchildren and their guide disappeared. More than 30 vast ancient tunnelcomplexes and underground cities have been found near Derinkuya in Turkey. Thelist goes on and on. The mysterious creature known as the Bigfoot, a large hairyape-like creature, is allegedly from within the Earth. There is a widespreadbelief among UFO researchers that there are reptilian underground bases wherethey work with their reptile-human crossbreed elite and I have spoken to formerCIA employees who confirm this. A reptilian race definitely live within thisplanet in a physical form and the only question is whether they are native tothe Earth or if they originate elsewhere? Again it is probably both, a mixtureof the two.Other dimensional?My own research suggests that it is from another dimension, the lower fourthdimension, that the reptilian control and manipulation is primarilyorchestrated. Without understanding the multidimensional nature of life and theUniverse, it is impossible to follow the manipulation of the Earth by anon-human force. As open minded scientists are now confirming, Creation consistsof an infinite number of frequencies or dimensions of life sharing the samespace in the same way that radio and television frequencies do. At the momentyou are tuned to the three-dimensional world or third dimension and so that iswhat you perceive as your reality. You are tuned to this station in other words.But, as with radio and television, all the other stations are broadcasting atthe same time and if you move your radio dial or change the TV channel you canconnect with them. When you do this, the station or channel you were tuned tobefore does not disappear, it continues to broadcast, but you can’t hear it orsee it anymore because you are no longer on its wavelength. So it is with humanconsciousness. Some people (everyone if the truth be told) can tune theirconsciousness to other wavelengths and connect with information andconsciousness operating on that frequency. We call this psychic power, but it ismerely the ability to move your ‘dial’ to another ‘station’. It is from one ofthese other stations or dimensions, that the Serpent Race, the Anunnaki, iscontrolling this world by ‘possessing’ certain bloodline streams. But as myresearch continues, it is clear that the fourth dimensional reptiliancontrollers are themselves controlled by fifth dimensional entities. Where doesit end? Who the hell knows. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it sounds off the wall, butthe truth usually does. You can put the book down now if it is too much to take,but you need to read it all to see what enormous evidence there is that this istrue. The ‘station’ from which the reptilians operate is the lower level of thefourth dimension, the one closest to this physical world. Other people know thisas the lower astral dimension, the legendary home of demons and malevolententities going back to antiquity. It is from here that today’s Satanists summontheir demonic entities in their black magic rituals. They are actually summoningthe reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. It is suggested by someresearchers, with good reason, that the non-physical reptilians were able topour into this dimension through holes or portals in the time-space fabriccaused by the nuclear tests and explosions which started in the deserts of NewMexico in the early 1940s. But I think such holes began to be created a longtime ago, before the cataclysms, when the world was at an even more advancedtechnological stage than it is today.The reptilian control of Planet Earth involves all three of the above themes. Ithink the reptilian genetic stream operates throughout the Universe and they arenot all malevolent, far from it. As with humanity, they contain the wholespectrum of attitudes from love to hate, freedom to control. I am identifying aparticular group of them, not the whole species – I cannot emphasise thisenough. This controlling group came here from the Draco constellation andelsewhere, and this is the origin of terms like draconian, a word which sums uptheir attitudes and agenda. They love to consume human blood and they are theblood-sucking demons of legend. The vampire stories are symbolic of this andwhat is the name of the most famous vampire? Count Dracula! The ‘Count’symbolises the aristocratic reptile-human crossbreed bloodlines which thereptilians possess from the lower fourth dimension and Dracula is an obviousreference again to Draco. The recent reports of the bloodsucking Chupacabra inPuerto Rico, Mexico, Florida and the Pacific Northwest fit the reptiliandescription. They have been seen sucking the blood of domestic livestock likegoats and their name means goat-sucker. The reptilians operate a pincer movementon the human race. Their physical expression lives under the ground andinteracts in the underground bases with human and human-reptile crossbreedscientists and military leaders. They also emerge to engage in some humanabductions. But the main control comes by outright possession. The crossbreedingprogramme (via sex and test tube) is described in the Sumerian Tablets and theOld Testament (the Sons of God who interbred with the daughters of men). Thesehybrid human-reptile lines carry the reptilian genetic code and thus can be farmore easily possessed by the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. As weshall see, these bloodlines became the British and European aristocracy androyal families and, thanks to the ‘Great’ British Empire, they were exportedacross the world to rule the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand andso on. These genetic lines are manipulated into the positions of political,military, media, banking and business power and thus these positions are held bylower fourth dimensional reptilians hiding behind a human form or bymind-puppets of the these same creatures. They operate through all races, butpredominantly the white one.As is well acknowledged, there is an area of the human brain to this day knownas the reptile brain. Within the brain is the original segment to which allother parts are additions. And, according to the neuroanatomist, Paul MacLean,this ancient area of the brain is driven by another prehistoric segment whichsome neuroanatomists call the R-complex.22[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208036] R is short for reptilian because weshare this with reptiles. MacLean says that this R-complex plays an importantrole in “aggressive behaviour, territoriality, ritualism and establishment ofsocial hierarchies”.23 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208217] This isprecisely the behaviour patterns of reptilians and their reptile-human hybridsas exposed in this book. The astronomer, Carl Sagan, knew far more than he evermade public and indeed he spent much of his career guiding people away from thetruth. But his knowledge of the true situation occasionally came through, aswhen he said that: “…it does no good whatsoever to ignore the reptiliancomponent of human nature, particularly our ritualistic and hierarchicalbehaviour. On the contrary, the model may help us understand what human beingsare all about.”24 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208301] He adds in hisbook, The Dragons Of Eden, that even the negative side of human behaviour isexpressed in reptilian terms, as in cold-blooded killer. Sagan (the name inreverse spells the East Indian reptilian gods, the Nagas) clearly knew thescore, but chose not to reveal openly what he knew. As the human foetus isforming into a baby it goes through many stages which connect with the majorevolutionary points in the development of the present physical form. Theseinclude connections with non-primate mammals, reptiles and fish. There is apoint in which the embryo develops gills, for example. The human embryo is verymuch like those of birds, sheep and pigs until the eighth week when it goes itsown evolutionary way. Occasionally the genetic instructions fail to remember thelatest script and some babies are born with tails. These are called caudalappendages and form in the lower lumbar region. Most are immediately removed bydoctors, but in some poorer countries where such medical support is notavailable, there are people who live their whole lives with tails.25[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208385] Pheromone is the substance secretedand released by animals so they can be detected by members of the same species.The pheromones in human women and iguanas are a chemical match.26[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208469]Look again at those figures at the start of the first chapter detailing thenumber of planets and stars that exist in the fraction of Creation we knowabout. The number of life forms in this galaxy alone is beyond imagination andthat’s only at the three-dimensional level of existence. If we judgepossibility, as we do, only by what we see on one little planet in one littlesolar system, our range of perception, imagination and vision will be somicroscopic that an understanding of what is really happening to this world willbe impossible. To that level of thinking the idea that a reptile race iscontrolling the planet from another dimension will be so far out as to beincomprehensible. That is the way the vast majority will, at first, receive theinformation in this book, but the appreciation of the ‘reptilian connection’ isgrowing among researchers who are interested in the truth and not just concernedwith defending a belief system or looking for public approval. Most researchersstill dismiss the whole idea, but the evidence is going to overwhelm them in thenext few years.In a remarkable period of 15 days as I travelled around the United States in1998, I met more than a dozen separate people who told me of how they had seenhumans transform into reptiles and go back again in front of their eyes. Twotelevision presenters had just such an experience while interviewing a man whowas in favour of the global centralisation of power known as the New WorldOrder. After the live interview, the male presenter said to his colleague thathe had experienced an amazing sight during the interview. He had seen the man’sface transform into a lizard-like creature and then return to human. His femalefellow presenter was astounded because she had seen the interviewee’s hands turnreptilian. The male presenter also told me of an experience a policeman friendhad while making a routine visit to an office block in Aurora, near Denver,Colorado. The policeman had commented to an executive of one of the companies onthe ground floor of the extreme nature of security in the building. She told himhe should look at the higher floors if he wanted to know how extensive it reallywas. She also pointed to a lift which only went to certain floors at the top ofthe building and, as they chatted, she told him of something she had seen someweeks earlier. The lift had opened and a very strange figure had emerged. He waswhite to the point of being albino, but he had a face shaped like a lizard andhis eye pupils were vertical like a reptile’s. This lizard-like figure hadwalked out of the lift and into an official-looking car waiting outside. Thepoliceman was so intrigued that he used his own time to check on the companiesat the top of the building served by the mystery lift. He found they were allfronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA.Then there are the experiences of Cathy O’Brien, the mind controlled slave ofthe United States government for more than 25 years, which she details in herastonishing book, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips.27[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208553] She was sexually abused as a childand an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among them were theUS Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and, most appallingly, George Bush, amajor player in the Brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. Itwas Bush, a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy’sdaughter, Kelly O’Brien, as a toddler before her mother’s courageous exposure ofthese staggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mindcontrol programme known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation OfAmerica of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office inWashington DC when he opened a book at a page depicting “lizard-like aliens froma far off, deep space place.”28 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208754]Bush then claimed to be an ‘alien’ himself and appeared, before her eyes, totransform ‘like a chameleon’ into a reptile. Cathy believed that some kind ofhologram had been activated to achieve this and from her understanding at thetime I can see why she rationalised her experience in this way. Anyone would,because the truth is too fantastic to comprehend until you see the build up ofevidence. There’s no doubt that alien-based mind programmes are part of thesemind control projects and that the whole UFO-extraterrestrial scene is beingmassively manipulated, not least through Hollywood films designed to mouldpublic thinking. Cathy says in her book that George Lucas, the producer of StarWars, is an operative with NASA and the National Security Agency, the ‘parent’body of the CIA.29 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208851] But given theevidence presented by so many other people, I don’t believe that what Bush saidand Cathy saw was just a mind control programme. I think he was revealing theBiggest Secret, that a reptilian race from another dimension has beencontrolling the planet for thousands of years. I know other people who have seenBush shape-shift into a reptilian.The president of Mexico in the 1980s, Miguel De La Madrid, also used Cathy inher mind controlled state. She said he told her the Legend of the Iguana andexplained that lizard-like extraterrestrials had descended upon the Mayans inMexico. The Mayan pyramids, their advanced astronomical technology and thesacrifice of virgins, was inspired by lizard-like aliens, he told her.30[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos208942] He added that these reptiliansinterbred with the Mayans to produce a form of life they could inhabit. De LaMadrid told Cathy that these reptile-human bloodlines could fluctuate between ahuman and iguana appearance through chameleon-like abilities – “a perfectvehicle for transforming into world leaders”, he said. De la Madrid claimed tohave Mayan-lizard ancestry in his blood which allowed him to transform back toan iguana at will. He then changed before her eyes, as Bush had, and appeared tohave a lizard-like tongue and eyes.31[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209038] Cathy understandably believed thisto be another holographic projection, but was it really? Or was De La Madridsaying something very close to the truth? This theme of being like a chameleonis merely another term for ‘shape-shifting’, a theme you find throughout theancient world and, among open minded people, in the modern one too.Shape-shifting is the ability to use your mind to project another physical imagefor people to see. Everything is energy vibrating at different speeds, so if youuse your mind to re-vibrate that energy to a different resonance, you can appearin any form you choose. Many witnesses have described how the so-called ‘Men inBlack’ materialise and dematerialise when they threaten people who arecommunicating information about extraterrestrials and UFOs. They can do thisbecause they are interdimensional beings who can appear in any form. This is themain reason for the obsession with interbreeding among the Elite bloodlinefamilies. They are seeking to maintain a genetic structure which allows them tomove between dimensions and shape-shift between a human and reptilianappearance. Once the genetic structure falls too far from it’s reptilian origin,they can’t shapeshift in this way or at least not as easily. As Credo Mutwaexplains, shapeshifting is a constant phenomena in African traditions.Mono-atomic (monatomic) goldWhile preparing this second edition I came across new information that wouldexplain shapeshifting and much else too, according to the research of BrianDesborough. It is mono-atomic gold which comes in the form of a white powder andhas a two-dimensional atomic structure (one or two atoms working together) whileregular gold has a three-dimensional structure (ten or more atoms workingtogether). Without going into all the scientific detail, when you consume thismono-atomic gold by mouth or injection, it increases the current carryingcapacity of the nervous system by ten thousand times. This would allow a personto process fantastic amounts of information like a super computer and whenenough has been absorbed it would allow them to consciously move through otherdimensions and shapeshift because suddenly the brain is activated to open thosevast areas that we do not use in today's world. It aligns the brain cells sothey all start talking to each other again. More than that, if you consumeenough of this mono-atomic gold your physical body would become luminous, soexplaining the ancient accounts of the reptilian gods and children of the godswho “shone like the Sun”. Mono-atomic gold can be made from regular gold and itcan be processed from certain ores, many of which are found in places likeArizona in the United States. This, I suggest, is the true meaning of thereferences to gold and gold mining in the Sumerian Tablets and not literallymining for normal gold, unless that was done to create the mono-atomic variety.This substance gave – gives – the reptilians amazing abilities to processinformation and shapeshift because of the staggering amounts of energy they canhold and process. I am sure the ancient Egyptians, Sumerians, Babylonians andPhoenicians used this, or more accurately, their ruling elite did, thus givingthem a potential denied the general population. The same continues today. Thiswas one of the big secrets held within the Mystery Schools and passed on intothe top levels of the modern secret society network. Mono-atomic gold also hasunbelievable healing properties in that it aligns the cells to carry phenomenalamounts of light energy, thus dispersing the blockages and imbalances we calldisease or illness.At NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre mind control laboratory near WashingtonDC, Cathy O’Brien says she was taken through another alien theme by Bill and BobBennett, two well-known figures in United States politics and fundamentallyconnected to the Brotherhood networks. After she was given mind altering drugs,this is what she says she experienced:“In the darkness around me I could hear Bill Bennett talking: ‘This is mybrother, Bob. He and I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension – twobeings from another plane.’“The high-tech light display swirling around me convinced me I was transformingdimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, whichseemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party – asthough I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognisinganyone, I frantically asked: ‘Who are these people?’“‘They’re not people and this isn’t a spaceship’, Bennett said. As he spoke, theholographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to belizard-like aliens. ‘Welcome to the second level of the underground. This is amere mirror reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from atrans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions…’“‘…I have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishing strongerholds on your mind than the Earth plane permits,’ Bill Bennett was saying.‘Being alien, I simply make my thoughts your thoughts by projecting them intoyour mind. My thoughts are your thoughts.’”32[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209122]Again, this might simply be a programming device, but given the other evidence Iam presenting, is it not more likely that, under the effects of the drugs andother techniques, Cathy’s mind had switched to the dimension in which thereptilians operate? The reptilians come from the lower fourth dimension andmerely use physical bodies as their vehicles to manipulate this one. It makessense, therefore, that if you can tune your mind to their true dimension youwill see them as they really are. Cathy’s descriptions mirror those of some‘abductees’ who have recalled how their extraterrestrial abductors at firstlooked quite human, but then changed to look like humanoid lizards. Are thesepeople really abducted by aliens in spaceships, or are they subjected to mindcontrol techniques like those experienced by Cathy O’Brien which connect themwith the lower fourth dimension? Hunter S. Thompson in his book, Fear AndLoathing In Las Vegas, 33 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209213] describesseeing reptiles while in a drugged condition and a guy I met in the UnitedStates (in those 15 days I mentioned earlier) told me a similar story. He‘tripped’ on large amounts of LSD in the 1960s and in his seriously mind-alteredstate he would see some people as humans and others as humanoid lizards andother reptiles. For a while he believed that he was merely hallucinating, but asa regular ‘tripper’ at high doses he began to realise that what he was seeing,usually by the third day of a five-day ‘trip’, was not an hallucination, but thevibratory veils lifting which allowed him to see beyond the physical to theforce controlling the person. In these moments the same people always had lizardfeatures and the same people always looked human. They never switched. He alsobegan to observe that those around him who appeared lizard-like in his alteredstate always seemed to react the same to movies, television programmes, etc. “Weused to laugh and say ‘here come the lizards’,” he told me. He believed therewas, to use his own phrase, a ‘morphogenetic field’ which transmitted to the DNAof the lizard-people and aligned the cell structure to the reptilian geneticblueprint. The more reptilian genes a person carries the easier it is for thiscommunication, or rather control, to take place. And the ones with the cellstructure most aligned to the reptilian blueprint are the Elite families thatrun the world to this day. It is not without reason that Diana, Princess ofWales used to call the Windsors the ‘lizards’ and the ‘reptiles’ and said in allseriousness: “They’re not human”. This was told to me by a close confidant ofDiana for nine years whom I quote at length later in the book.At the end of that 15 days of meeting person after person telling me the samestory of seeing humans become reptiles, I was sitting in the speakers’ room at aWhole Life Expo event in Minneapolis where I was appearing and was chattingabout these experiences when a gifted psychic lady said that she knew what I wastalking about, because she could see the reptiles inside and around the bodiesof leading world politicians, and the business, banking and military élite. Thiswas possible because, as someone who had accessed her psychic sight, she couldsee beyond the physical and into the lower fourth dimension where thesereptilians reside. What did Miguel De La Madrid say to Cathy O’Brien? Thereptile-human bloodlines could fluctuate between a human and iguana appearancethrough chameleon-like abilities – “a perfect vehicle for transforming intoworld leaders”. This psychic lady said that most of the people in positions ofpower appeared to be reptiles, but there were others who were still human andthese people, she said, were “overshadowed and controlled” by a reptile, butthey weren’t actually reptiles. We would call this being possessed. This is animportant distinction. There are the ‘full-bloods’ who are reptilians using anapparent human form to hide their true nature, and the ‘hybrids’, thereptile-human crossbreed bloodlines, who are possessed by the reptilians fromthe fourth dimension. A third type are the reptilians who directly manifest inthis dimension, but can’t hold that state indefinitely. Some of the ‘Men inBlack’ are examples of this. Many of the possessed people will have no idea thatthis is so, but their thoughts are the reptilians’ thoughts and they act in waysthat advance the Agenda without realising the background to how and why they arebeing used. Leading Brotherhood families like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers,Bushes and the Windsors are full-bloods, reptilians wearing human physicalbodies like an overcoat in the full knowledge of who they are and the Agendathey are seeking to implement. Another comment the psychic lady made was that inher altered state of consciousness, Hillary Clinton appeared as a reptile, whileher husband, Bill Clinton the US President, was only overshadowed and controlledby one. This is interesting because my own research, and that of others, hasrevealed Hillary Clinton to be much higher in the hierarchy than Bill, who,while of a crossbreed bloodline, is a pawn in the game, to be used and discardedas necessary. It is not always that the most powerful people are placed in whatappears to be the most powerful jobs. Often they are not. They are thestring-pullers of those who appear to have the power.There is another key difference between the full-bloods and the crossbreeds.Everything is created by sound. When you think or feel, you emit a wave ofenergy which changes the energy around you to resonate at that same vibratorylevel. That wave is actually a sound, broadcasting beyond the range of humanhearing. Form cannot exist without sound. As you can see in a fantastic seriesof videos called Cymatics, 34 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209407] it issound which turns matter into form. In the videos, sand and other particles areplaced on a metal plate and this is vibrated by different sounds which rearrangethe sand into amazing, often geometric patterns. With each change of sound thepatterns change accordingly. Go back to the original sound and the originalpattern returns immediately. It is like the waves that form the concentriccircles of the planetary orbits around the Sun I mentioned in the last chapter.The solar system is also the creation of sound. Everything is. In the beginningwas the word and the word was… sound. In the Cymatics videos you see theparticles form into mini planets, solar systems and galaxies, just through soundvibrations. Sound is also a wonderful form of healing because by resonating thebody and its organs at their proper vibration they can be healed. Illness isdis-ease, the disharmony of the natural vibrational state of the body and,because our thoughts and emotions are actually sound waves, our imbalancedthoughts and emotions disrupt the vibrational harmony and therefore lead todis-ease. This is how emotional stress causes illness. It is so simple. Anyway,another incredible example of all this in the Cymatics videos is seeing almosthuman-like figures forming from the particles when certain sounds are emitted.Our bodies are also the result of sound resonating energy into form and if ourminds are powerful enough to change the sound range of the body, it moves intoanother form or disappears from this dimension altogether. This is what iscalled shape-shifting. It is not a miracle, it is science, the natural laws ofcreation. The full-blood reptilians of the lower fourth dimension can thereforemake their ‘human’ physical form disappear and bring forward their reptilianlevel of existence. They shape-shift. To us in this dimension they appear human,but it’s just a vibrational overcoat.After the first draft of this chapter was completed I met another woman, thistime in England, who had been married to a man involved in Satanic ritual andthe Brotherhood networks. He was head keeper of an area of land called BurnhamBeeches near the Buckinghamshire-Berkshire border a few miles from Slough, westof London. This is an ancient site mentioned in the Domesday Book at the time ofWilliam the Conqueror in the 11th century and it has a reputation for Satanism.It is owned by the City of London – a key centre of the global Brotherhoodnetwork with two winged reptiles on its coat of arms. The lady who spoke to mewas taking her dog for a walk across the land at dusk in the early 1970s whenshe saw a figure in a long red robe. When he lifted his head, she saw that hisface was that of a lizard. She obviously thought she was crazy, but this was noillusion, she said. The ‘lizard’ was very real and very physical, not anapparition. She is very psychic and she later began to see people eithertransform into lizards before her eyes or be overshadowed by them in exactly theway described by the American psychic. If you look in the picture section youwill see an artist’s impression of what she sees with her psychic sight and manyothers have described exactly the same experiences. On July 20th 1988, a numberof people in Bishopsville, South Carolina said they were terrorised by a “sevenfoot tall lizard-man that had no hair, eyebrows or lips, three fingers on eachhand and large slanted eyes that glowed red in colour”. There were fivesightings of this “lizard-man” and the story was reported in the Los AngelesTimes and the Herald Examiner. 35 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209599]When you go with the flow of life and listen to your intuition, you are shownwhat you need to know by the incredible synchronicity that daily surrounds youand guides you through the smokescreens and the halls of mirrors. One day inFebruary 1998 in Johannesburg, South Africa, I spent nearly five hours talkingwith the Zulu, Credo Mutwa, in my first meeting with him. The word Zulu meansPeople from the Stars because they believe they are a royal race that originatesbeyond this planet. We talked about the global manipulation and his belief thatan extraterrestrial race is behind the global Brotherhood of monarchs,politicians, bankers and media owners, although not at that stage about itsreptilian nature. Afterwards I went back to the house where I was staying andwrote down the main points he mentioned on my laptop computer before goingdownstairs into the lounge for the evening. As I sat down a movie was juststarting, it was called The Arrival36[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209744] and was about a reptile-likeextraterrestrial race which had taken over the planet by operating through humanbodies and appearing to be human. Someone was trying to tell me something! Andthat something is the truth. Another lesser-known movie I saw about this timewas called They Live37 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209866] and againthe theme was of an extraterrestrial race taking over the world by workingthrough human physical bodies. Alien Resurrection38[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos209981] was another to carry the reptiliantheme with the implication that the aliens were occupying the bodies of humans.But the closest any movie has come to the truth is the American televisionseries of the 1980s called V. 39 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos210110] Ittells of a reptile extraterrestrial race who take over the world by looking likehumans. The film depicts the reptiles as being covered in some sort of latexskin, which is not how it works in reality, but the theme of the series is righton the button and a foretaste of things to come; unless we wake up fast. Ihighly recommend you think about watching the video of V to get a visual feelfor the themes I am exposing in this book.One of the leading researchers into this phenomenon has been the American, AlexChristopher, author of the books Pandora’s Box, Volumes I and II, 40[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos210288] which reveal, in part, thereptilian presence on this planet. Alex has seen reptilians and what she callsthe big-eyed Greys. One night in Panama City, Florida she says she was called at2.30 in the morning by her frantic neighbours, a woman and her partner, acommercial airline pilot. When she ran over to their house, she found the womanpassing out, sliding down the wall with her eyeballs rolling. Alex said she feltan incredible energy in the room that seemed to be trying to penetrate her head.There was definitely radiation, she said, and the next day all the plants in theroom were dead. She grabbed the couple and took them outside where they talkedfor a while. They said they had been making love when the incident began andthis is very significant because the reptilians feed off human emotional andsexual energy which is one reason why sex is so fundamental to Satanic ritualsperformed for the ‘demons’ – this reptilian group. The couple said they saw aflash of light and then they were pulled from the bed. The man still had a palmprint on his side made by fingers that must have been ten inches long with clawsthat burned into his skin. The next day that spot was so painful he couldn’ttouch it and Alex Christopher has video footage of this. When the couple hadcalmed down and Alex went back to bed in her house, she came face to face with areptilian herself:“I woke up and there is this “thing” standing over my bed. He had wrap-aroundyellow eyes with snake pupils and pointed ears, and a grin that wrapped aroundhis head. He had a silvery suit on and this scared the living daylights out ofme. I threw the covers over my head and started screaming… I mean, here is thisthing with a Cheshire-cat grin and these funky glowing eyes… this is too much. Ihave seen this kind of being on more than one occasion… He had a hooked nose andwas very human looking, other than his eyes, and had kind of greyish skin…“…Later on in 1991, I was working in a building in a large city, and I had takena break about 6pm and the next thing I knew it was 10.30pm and I thought I hadtaken a short break. I started remembering that I was taken aboard a(space)ship, through four floors of the office building and through a roof.There on the ship is where I encountered Germans and Americans working together,and also grey aliens, and then we were taken to some other kind of facility andthere I saw reptilians again… the ones I call the “Baby Godzillas” that haveshort teeth and yellow slanted eyes… The things that stick in my mind are thebeings that look like reptiles, or the “velcoci-rapters”. They are the cruellestbeings you could ever imagine and they even smell hideous.”41[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos210514]On the ‘ship’ she remembers seeing the Germans and Americans wearing aninsignia, a blue triangle with a red-eyed dragon and circle around it. A contactlater told her that she saw the same symbol at Fort Walden in the United States.A winged serpent symbol could also be seen on the sleeve of an Israeli soldieras he comforted the daughter of the assassinated Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin,at her father’s funeral in 1995. (See Newsweek, November 20th 1995.) One of AlexChristopher’s specialities is the new Denver Airport which is reputed to be acover for a deep underground reptilian-human base. It is certainly a strangeplace. The first time I spoke on these conspiracy subjects in the United Stateswas in Denver in August 1996, and I’d landed at Denver Airport with no idea ofits background. Even so, as soon as the plane landed I’d felt a very strangeenergy, very weird and unpleasant. The airport was built at enormous cost onopen land a long way from Denver and it is full of Masonic symbols. There arealso gargoyles, the winged-reptile figures that you find on the stately homes ofthe reptilian aristocracy in Britain and on the churches and great cathedrals ofEurope which were built by the Brotherhood network. There are also gargoyles ona building in Dealey Plaza where President Kennedy was assassinated and now theyturn up again in a modern airport built on an alleged underground reptilianbase. Gargoyles are symbols of the reptilians and that is why you will find themat Denver Airport. The capstone or dedication stone at the airport is markedwith the classic compass symbol of the Freemasons and it stands in part of theterminal called The Great Hall, another Freemasonic term. On a wall is agrotesque mural full of malevolent symbolism, including three caskets with deadfemales in them: a Jewish girl, a Native American and a black woman. Anothergirl is holding a Mayan tablet that tells of the destruction of civilisation. Ahuge character, described as a ‘green Darth Vader’ by Alex Christopher, standsover a destroyed city with a sword in his hand and women are walking along aroad holding dead babies. All the children of the world are depicted takingweapons from each country and handing them to a figure of a German boy with aniron fist and an anvil in his hand. Denver is apparently scheduled to be theheadquarters of the Western sector of the United States under the fascist globalstate called the New World Order which is planned beyond the year 2000. Atlantais said to be the centre for the Eastern sector and I remember thinking someyears ago how the design of Denver and Atlanta airports were so similar – now Iknow why.Colorado is a major centre for the New World Order and the Queen of England,under another name, has been buying up land there. As you will see later, theBritish Royal Family are massively involved in this story and so is the murderof Diana, Princess of Wales. One of Christopher’s main contacts was a guy calledPhil Schneider, the son of a German U-boat commander in World War II, who wascommissioned to build a number of deep underground bases in the United States. Isaw some of his lectures on video when he began to speak out publicly about theunderground network of bases, cities and tunnels throughout the United States.He later died in very suspicious circumstances which were meant to appear like‘suicide’. Schneider said that Denver Airport was connected to a deepunderground base that went down at least eight levels. It included a 4.5 squaremile underground city and a vast base, he said. Other contacts who have beenunderground at Denver Airport claim that there are large numbers of humanslaves, many of them children, working there under the control of thereptilians. Two of the bases that Phil Schneider claims to have helped to buildare the infamous Area 51 in Nevada and Dulce in New Mexico, which is connectedby the tunnel network to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I have been to LosAlamos and the vibes are simply horrible. After speaking about the reptilianinvolvement in human affairs on the Sightings radio show in the United States, Iwas sent an account by an army private stationed on the surface at Dulce. Herealised there was something ‘mighty odd’ about the place, but could not explainwhy. He remembered:“…I was working on a routine job when another of the young enlistees, amechanic, came in with a small rush job he wanted welded at once. He had theprint and proceeded to show me exactly what he wanted. We are both bending overthe bench in front of the welder when I happened to look directly into his face.It seemed to suddenly become covered in a semi-transparent film or cloud. Hisfeatures faded and in their place appeared a “thing” with bulging eyes, no hairand scales for skin.”He later saw the same thing happen to a guard at the Dulce front gate. Otherwitnesses have spoken of seeing more reptilian-chameleons working at the MadiganMilitary Hospital near Fort Lewis, south of Seattle in Washington State. Again Ihave spoken in that general area and found it all extremely strange, not least a‘New age’ centre close to Fort Lewis. Jason Bishop III has conducted extensivestudies into the Dulce operation and established the involvement of a cartelthat I expose in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, including organisations likethe Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT & T, Hughes Aircraft, NorthropCorporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford Research Institute, WalshConstruction, the Bechtel Corporation, the Colorado School of Mines and so on.Bechtel (Becktul) is a major link in the Brotherhood–reptile network. There areat least seven levels underground at Dulce, probably more, and Bishop hascompiled accounts of workers there who have described what they have seen. Theiraccounts mirror the descriptions of the Anunnaki in the Sumerian Texts as theyinterbred species to produce hideous hybrids of many types. This is what workershave said about Dulce:“Level number six is privately called “Nightmare Hall”, it holds the GeneticLabs. Reports from workers who have seen bizarre experimentation, are asfollows: ‘I have seen multi-legged “humans” that look like half human/halfoctopus. Also reptilian-humans and furry creatures that have hands like humansand cry like a baby, it mimics human words… also a huge mixture of lizard-humansin cages.’ There are fish, seals, birds and mice that can hardly be consideredthose species. There are several cages (and vats) of winged humanoids, grotesquebat-like creatures… but three and a half to seven feet tall. Gargoyle-likebeings and Draco-reptoids.“Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousands of humans and humanmixtures in cold storage. Here, too, are embryo storage vats of humanoids invarious stages of development. (One worker said:) ‘…I frequently encounteredhumans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and beggedfor help. We were told they were hopelessly insane, and involved in high riskdrug tests to cure insanity. We were told never to try to speak to them at all.At the beginning we believed that story. Finally, in 1978, a small group ofworkers discovered the truth.’”42 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos210708]This discovery apparently led to the ‘Dulce Wars’, a battle between humans andthe extraterrestrials in 1979 when many scientists and military personnel werekilled. Phil Schneider claimed to have taken part in a shoot out with the aliensat Dulce in which he was hit by a laser gun which cut open his chest. Certainlyhe had a fantastic scar down his chest, as he revealed publicly. The base wasclosed for a time as a result of this conflict, but has since reopened. Anotherreptilian underground base is under Boynton Canyon in Sedona, Arizona. Thecentre of the base is believed to be in the, appropriately named, Secret Canyon.Similar bases and underground cities exist across the world and they areconnected by tunnels with incredibly fast ‘tube-shuttles’. The tunnels are builtvery quickly by technology like the Subterrene, a nuclear-powered machine thatmelts the rock and shapes it into the tunnel walls. It was developed at LosAlamos. It is significant that underground nuclear tests were carried out inNevada and New Mexico, the location of many deep underground facilities whichhave been connected with reptilians. Were those ‘tests’ located there to open upvast underground caverns? Another theme I have had from many contacts is thatthe reptilians can feed off nuclear energy.What they look likeSummarising all the research I have read, the people I have met, and theaccounts of those who claim to have experienced these reptile humanoids orreptilians, the following appears to be the case. There are many sub andcrossbreed races of the reptilians. Their élite is known by UFO researchers asthe Draco. These are the ‘big boys’ in every sense and they are usually betweenseven and twelve feet tall. They have wings which are flaps of skin supported bylong ribs.43 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos210835] The wings can befolded back against the body and they are the origin of the term “wingedserpent”. They are also the origin of the term ‘fallen angels’ and the wingedgargoyles are symbolic of these Draco. The cape worn by Count Dracula issymbolic of these wings and the character of Dracula in the Bram Stoker storiesis said to be a fallen angel. The winged Draco are also known as the Dragon Raceand some of the ancient gods were described and depicted as birdmen. This couldbe one of the origins of the Phoenix and eagle in Brotherhood symbolism, as wellas the more esoteric meanings. The biblical Satan is depicted as a reptilian,too.Some of the Draco reptilian hierarchy are apparently white or albino white andnot the usual green or brown, and this connects with the description of thestrange ‘albino’ lizard humanoid in the building in Aurora, near Denver. CredoMutwa talks of the white reptilians also. The Draco are the ‘royalty’ of thereptilians and the highest caste are the albino whites, who apparently haveconical horns midway between the brow and the top of the skull. This struck meimmediately because the ancient ‘gods’ and royalty were depicted as wearing ahorned headdress, symbolic of these ‘royal’ reptilians, I’m certain, and againCredo Mutwa confirms this from his knowledge. Other species, like the soldierclass and scientists, are known as Reptoids. They don’t have wings, but all ofthem are cold-blooded.44 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211021] Theirscales are much larger on their backs and they have three fingers with anopposing thumb. They have three toes with a fourth towards the side of theirankle and their claws are short and blunt. They have large, cat-like eyes whichglow red and a mouth that looks more like a slit. Some have eyes which aredescribed as black and others are white with flame-coloured vertical pupils.Again this is what the lady described in the Aurora case. The reptilians arefive to twelve feet tall and they are the ‘giants’ described so widely in theancient legends and records. Some have tails, others do not. One of their otherplanets of influence long ago is reckoned to have been Mars and so were reptilecrossbreeds among the white Martians even before they came here? ZechariaSitchin also speculates that the Anunnaki went to Mars before coming to Earth.This would certainly fit the picture and it could well be that the whiteMartians in Brian Desborough’s scenario and the Annunaki have long beengenetically connected. A high priestess of the Brotherhood hierarchy who hasbroken out of their clutches, at least at the time I spoke with her, says thatthe reptilian Anunnaki invaded Mars long ago and the white race of Martianseventually left that planet for Earth. The Anunnaki on Mars followed, she said,although I have no doubt that some are there now in underground bases. Wheneverone of the NASA Mars probes is in danger of letting the public see somethingthey shouldn’t, the link mysteriously goes down or the probe disappearsaltogether. What is without question is that the white race, whatever itsorigin, has been the main vehicle of the Anunnaki crossbreeding programme forthe takeover of Planet Earth. Researchers believe that the reptilians are thecontrollers of the so-called Greys, the classic extraterrestrial figure ofmodern times with their big black eyes. The Greys feature in most of theabduction accounts. Jason Bishop III in his writings on this subject says thatthe hierarchy of control is: Draco (winged reptilian); Draco (non-winged);Greys; Humans. There also appears to be a reptilian ‘alliance’ with some otherextraterrestrial groups. Credo Mutwa explains in The Reptilian Agenda Part One,how he was abducted by the Greys in 1959. He says that he knows from this andthe Greys caught, and often eaten, by Africans over the centuries, that the‘black eyes’ are actually goggles covering their real eyes, which are reptilian.He also says that what seems to be grey skin is, in fact, an extremely tightfalse skin or suit. The Greys, he says, are really reptiles.It is suggested that human sacrifice to the ‘gods’ in the ancient world,particularly of children, was for the benefit of reptilians who demanded theserituals (a trait of the reptile brain is ritualism). I am sure this is true andit will be extremely relevant in the latter part of this book. Credo Mutwa saysthat this is the case, also. At the moment of death by sacrifice a form ofadrenaline surges through the body and accumulates at the base of the brain andis, apparently, most potent in children.45[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211105] This is what the reptilians andtheir crossbreeds want, it is said, and they certainly feed off human blood andflesh. These ancient sacrifices were literally to the gods, the Anunnakireptilians, and they continue today. The common theme of all research into thereptilians is that they are emotionless and without sentiment and, at the fourthdimensional level, they feed off the energy of low vibrational human emotionslike fear, guilt and aggression. When we emit such emotions their energy can’tbe seen in this world because it resonates to the lower fourth dimensionalfrequency and there it is absorbed by the reptilians. The more of these emotionsthat can be stimulated, the more energy the reptilians have to work with. Thuswe have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughter ofanimals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, andblack magic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will staggerthose who have not studied the subject.Sons of the godsThe reptilian breeding programme appears to have produced an Anunnaki-humanhybrid (Adam?) around 200,000–300,000 years ago. I’m sure other extraterrestrialraces have also interbred with humanity to produce the glorious variety of Earthpeoples, but I am focusing here on the reptilian group because of their desireto control and manipulate human affairs. Clearly, the farther you go back themurkier the story becomes, but there is enough supporting and cross-referencingevidence to present the themes of what happened. The more I look at this, themore it is clear to me that what the reptilians did on Mars they have done here.They infilitrated the home population through interbreeding and took the placeover. It seems to me that there were already reptile-Aryan bloodlines among theMartians when they came to Earth. One of the main locations for the Anunnaki andthe Martians or Aryans, particularly during and after the Venus cataclysm ofaround 4,800 BC, were the mountains of Turkey, Iran and Kurdistan, and it wasfrom here that they and their hybrids re-emerged when the waters receded. It wasthey who created the ‘instant’ advanced civilisations in the low lands of Sumer,Egypt, Babylon and the Indus Valley. A particular centre for the Anunnakireptilians would seem to have been the Caucasus Mountains and this is an areathat will appear again and again in this story. I feel there was a majorbreeding programme in this region, probably underground, which produced a verylarge number of hybrid reptile-human crossbreeds. One area of research that ishighly relevant to this region are the number of people with Rh negative orrhesus negative blood. Often rhesus negative babies turn blue immediately afterbirth. This is the origin of the term ‘blue bloods’ for royal bloodlines andother terms like ‘true blue’. It is speculated that the ‘blue’ bloodlines couldbe of Martian decent and from wherever the Martian bloodlines came from beforethat. Far more white people are Rh negative than blacks or Asians.The genes of the albino-white ‘royal’ Draco appear to have been used to createthe ‘royal’ reptile-human hybrid bloodlines which have been used to rule theworld since ancient times. These were the ones known to the ancients as thedemi-gods, who were given the task of middlemen, controlling the population andrunning the world according to the Agenda of their reptile masters. What isclear is that while the Annunaki interbred with many Earth races, the white racehas been their main vehicle for taking over the planet and the ‘royal’ Draco atthe top of their hierarchy are albino white. Significantly, when you look atancient accounts, many of their hybrid creations had blond hair and blue eyes. Amajor change would seem to have taken place soon after the Venus upheavalsbecause the Ubaid culture (5,000–4,000 BC), in what is now Iraq, worshipped godswho were depicted as lizard-humanoids while the Sumerians (4,000–2,000 BC), wholived in the same area, depict their gods as very human. This change, and thecrossbreeding programme in the Caucasus region, are fundamentally connected, I’msure. The Anunnaki–human crossbreed élite was described by the Sumerians andthere are many other accounts of the interbreeding of extraterrestrials andhumans, or the ‘gods’ and ‘sky people’ interbreeding with humanity. This is mostfamously noted in Genesis where it says:“When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and theymarried any of them they chose… The Nefilim were on the earth in those days –and also afterwards – when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and hadchildren by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.”Genesis 6:1-4According to the translations of Zecharia Sitchin, the word Nefilim relates to“Those Who Decended” while others say it means “the fallen ones” or “those whohave fallen”. The word ‘renown’ in that passage in Genesis is translated fromthe Sumerian word shem. This has been translated in the Bible as relating to‘name’, as in making a name for yourself as a man of renown. Sitchin says thereal meaning of shem is ‘sky vehicle’. He says it comes from the root, shu-mu,which means ‘that which is a MU’, and a MU was a flying craft, he says. So ‘menof renown’ becomes ‘men or people of the sky vehicles’. It was these whointerbred with human women. This passage in Genesis, I would suggest, tells ofthe interbreeding between the extraterrestrials or inner terrestrials withhumans to produce the reptile-human hybrids. The term ‘sons of God’ in factcomes from the Hebrew, bene-ha-elohim, which really translates as ‘sons of thegods’. The early offspring of these genetic encounters were the giants of legendand there are many records of such hybrids being born. There are numerousaccounts throughout the ancient world, on every continent, of a giant race andthe biblical Goliath could well have been symbolic of these people. The NativeAmericans have many tales of the Star People coming down from the skies to breedwith human women and Alex Christopher says that a common denominator in theabduction of humans by reptilians in the United States appears to relate to theperson’s bloodline, particularly those that go back to Native Americans orancient Indians. The Hopi, you will recall, speak of originating within theEarth. The Ethiopian text, the Kebra Nagast (Nagas were Indian shape-shifting‘serpent gods’), is thousands of years old, and it refers to the enormous sizeof the babies produced from the sexual or genetic unions of humans and the‘gods’. It tells how: “…the daughters of Cain with whom the angels(extraterrestrials) had conceived… were unable to bring forth their children,and they died.” It describes how some of these giant babies were delivered bycaesarean section: “…having split open the bellies of their mothers they cameforth by their navels.”46 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211214] In theancient Hebrew text, the Book of Noah, and its derivative, the Book of Enoch, astrange birth is described of a non-human child, who turns out to be Noah ofGreat Flood fame. References to this also appear in the Dead Sea Scrolls, therecords of the Essene Community in Palestine 2,000 years ago which included muchmaterial from the Book of Enoch. The strange child the texts describe is the sonof Lamech. He is said to be unlike a human being and more like ‘the children ofthe angels in heaven’. Lamech’s child, Noah, is described as white skinned andblond-haired with eyes that made the whole house ‘shine like the Sun’. Reptilianbeings with shining eyes and glowing bodies are described by Credo Mutwa in hisAfrican accounts, ancient and modern. Blond-haired, blue-eyed beings withlaser-like eyes is a description for mysterious people or ‘gods’ which spansthousands of years to the present day and appear in cultures across the world.Lamech questions his wife about the father of the child:“Behold, I thought then within my heart that conception was (due) to theWatchers and the Holy Ones…and to the Nephilim…and my heart was troubled withinme because of this child.”47 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211415]In the Shahnemeh or Book of Kings, the legendary history of Iran completed in1010 AD by the Arab poet, Firdowsi, he describes the birth of a baby called Zal,the son of a king called Sam. Again the king is horrified by the unearthlyappearance of his child who has a very large body ‘as clean as silver’, hair aswhite as an old man’s and ‘like snow’, and a face compared with the Sun. Samcalls his son a demon child, a child of the daevas – the Watchers. On CredoMutwa’s ‘necklace’ is an eye which he says symbolises the ‘watchers’, theChitauri reptilians. Like the patriarchs of the Old Testament, the Iraniansappeared to have an aversion to children born with extremely white features. Andwho is said to be extremely white, albino white? The royal hierarchy of theDraco. The text of the Shahnemeh says of Zal:“No human being of this earthCould give such a monster birth,He must be of the Demon race,Though human still in form and face,If not a Demon, he at least,Appears a party-coloured beast.”48 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211661]Zal later marries a foreign princess called Rudabeh, the daughter of Mehrab, theking of Karbul, and a descendant of the Serpent king, Zahhak, who was said tohave ruled Iran for a thousand years. This was one of the reptilian bloodlinesand in keeping with this, Rudabeh is described as tall as a teak tree, ivorywhite etc, the familiar features of the Watcher-human offspring. Thesedescriptions abound for the royal lines of Iran and the Near East, as do theircomparison with trees because of their great height. It seems from their textsthat you required the Nefilim-Watcher physical characteristics to qualify to beking. This is the origin of the ‘divine right of kings’, the right to rule byvirtue of your family bloodline, a system which continued when these linesexpanded into Europe. Even the British title of Sir, conferred by the Queen onher selected subjects, comes from an ancient snake-goddess (reptilian) calledSir, which relates to the Anunnaki goddess, Ninlil or Ninkharsag, in theSumerian tablets. Her husband, Enlil, was called the Splendid Serpent of theshining eyes. His brother, Enki, was also known as a serpent and his emblem wastwo entwined serpents, the symbol of his ‘cult centre’ at Eridu, and of themodern medical profession. The symbol is known as the caduceus (see Figure 5).This information comes from the Sumerian Tablets as translated by ZechariaSitchin and described in his books. Therefore I found it staggering that Sitchinpersonally told me there was no evidence of a serpent race and advised me(almost warned me) to cease my research into such matters. The idea that thereis no evidence is simply ludicrous, so why would Sitchin say that to me? He wasadamant that I should end this line of research. I have absolutely no doubt thatthe Anunnaki and the Watchers are the same reptilian race – the ‘serpents withthe shining eyes’ identified by Christian and Barbara O’Brien in their work,Genius Of The Few.49 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos211863][../Images/00013.jpg]Figure 5: The ancient caduceus, symbol of the modern medical profession andsymbolic of many things, including, quite possibly, the twin spirals of DNA orperhaps representing a particular wavelength or frequency.Author and researcher, Andrew Collins, says he has a Canaanite copper figurinedepicting one of their gods of around 2000 BC.50[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212109] It has a serpentine neck and a headshaped like the hood of a cobra which curls over to form a snake-likeheaddress.51 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212233] Over the thousands ofyears since these royal reptile-human hybrid bloodlines were created, they havebecome more integrated into the general population and less physically obvious,but the basic genetic structure remains and the Brotherhood maintains verydetailed genetic records of who has it and who doesn’t. Christian and BarbaraO’Brien say in Genius Of The Few that if the Annunaki had interbred withhumanity hundreds of thousands of years ago and then interbred with them againabout 30,000 years ago, the result of the second interbreeding would be agenetic structure that was 75% Anunnaki and 25% human. I think there was anotherbreeding programme far more recently, after the Venus flood of about 7,000 yearsago. These later bloodlines would have been even more Anunnaki than previousversions, of course. These are the reptilian crossbreeds who run the world todayand it this profusion of reptilian genes which allows such people to shape-shiftinto reptilians and back into an apparently human form. These bloodlines alsohave the ability to produce an extremely powerful hypnotic stare, just like asnake hypnotising its prey, and this is the origin of the term ‘giving someonethe evil eye’. Credo Mutwa describes exactly the same phenomena in Africa. Allthis is the real reason for the obsession with blood and the interbreeding ofthe ‘blue blood’ families and their offshoots. This is why since the earliesttimes of known history, the blue blood heirs married their half-sisters andcousins, just as the Anunnaki did according to the Sumerian Tablets. The mostimportant gene in this succession is passed on by the female line, so the choiceof female sexual partner has been vital to them.It is highly significant that the ‘serpent king’ bloodline should originate fromIran because it is from this region of Iran, Kurdistan, Armenia, Turkey and theCaucasus Mountains, that these reptile-human bloodlines overwhelmingly emergedto take over the world. A Brotherhood insider, a Russian, said there was amassive vortex, an interdimensional gateway, in the Caucasus Mountains where theextraterrestrials entered this dimension. That would explain a great deal. Thename Iran comes from the earlier Airy-ana or Air-an, which means Land of theAryas or Aryans.52 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212317] Still todaythere are two distinct races in Kurdistan, the olive skinned of medium heightwith dark eyes, and the much taller, white skinned people, often with blue eyes.You will note that these traits were considered the ‘Master Race’ by the Nazisand this was because the Nazis knew the history and the connection with thereptilians. Andrew Collins in his book, From The Ashes Of Angels, presentscompelling evidence that the biblical Garden of Eden was high up in this regionof Iran-Kurdistan and, of course, the theme of the serpent is at the heart ofthe Eden story. In neighbouring Media, the kings were known by the Iranians asMâr which means snake in Persian.53 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212563]Mars = snake? They were called the ‘dragon dynasty of Media’ or the ‘descendantsof the dragon’.54 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212681] I have no doubtthat the reptilian Draco interbred with humans to produce crossbreeds within thewhite race and, indeed, there are many people around the world today who claimto have bred with reptilians. By 2,200 BC the Royal Court of the Dragon had beenfounded in Egypt by the priests of Mendes and this still continues today, 4,000years later, as the Imperial and Royal Court of the Dragon Sovereignty, nowheadquartered in Britain. Some people call this the Brotherhood of the Snake.The early kings of Sumer, Egypt, and later, Israel, were anointed at theircoronation with the ‘fat of the Dragon’ which was the fat of the sacredcrocodile. The croc was known in Egypt as a messeh and from this comes the term‘Messiah’ which means Anointed One. The kings of the succession were also knownas ‘Dragons’ and all this symbolism relates to the knowledge that these royalfamilies were the bloodlines of the reptile-human crossbreeds. When manykingdoms joined together in battle, they appointed a king of kings and he wasknown as the Great Dragon or… Draco. The famous Celtic title, Pendragon, is aversion of this. Kingship actually originates from the word kin or bloodrelative and kin-ship became kingship. Just to emphasise the point about thereptile bloodlines here, the name the Egyptians gave to their sacred messeh orcrocodile was… Draco. This also became a symbol of the Egyptian Therapeutate andtheir branch in Israel called the Essenes, and it was represented as a seaserpent or Bistea Neptunis by the ‘royal’ Merovingians and their decendents inFrance. The same tribe, all of them. If you look in the picture section you willsee an ancient Egyptian depiction of a ‘god’ on the temple wall at Saqquara – itappears to be a non-human reptilian figure with what appear to be wings. I guessit could be a trick of the eyes, but see for yourself.Blond-haired, blue-eyed beings with eyes like lasers are still being reported.An American friend told me of an experience her father had in the early 1970s.They lived in Turkey at the time where he worked at a listening post forAmerican Military Intelligence. He came home one night in a terrible state. Whenasked what was wrong, he just mumbled: “The world is not like we think it is”.Although he rarely drank, he asked for a scotch, and then another. As he relaxedhe told his daughter of a communication he had taken that day from the pilot ofa plane which was stationed at the Turkish base. The pilot reported that he wasflying near the North Pole when suddenly his engines stopped and all theelectrical systems switched off. The plane then gently lowered itself verticallyto the ground and to his disbelief a mountain top opened up and the plane cameto rest inside. What he saw was a scene straight from James Bond. He got out ofthe plane wondering what the hell was going on and he was met by tall,blond-haired people with ‘pearl’ coloured skin and ‘bluish-purple’ eyes whichappeared electrically charged somehow: like laser eyes. They all wore long whitegowns and, perhaps significantly, this is how the central-South America ‘god’known as Quetzalcoatl was described. They also wore a Maltese Cross medallion ona chain. The pilot’s memory was hazy about what happened after he first met ‘olblue eyes’, but he remembered walking into a room and seeing a group of thesebeings sitting around a conference table. Eventually, he was taken back to hisplane and as it rose from the mountain his engines and electronics restarted.Now having heard the descriptions of these beings by a modern US pilot, look athow the Book of Enoch describes the Watchers:“And there appeared to me two men very tall, such as I have never seen on earth.And their faces shone like the sun, and their eyes were like burning lamps…Their hands were brighter than snow.”55[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212765]This would connect also with the ancient description of ‘gods’ as the ‘shiningones’. There is certainly much more to our history than we are being told andmuch more happening on this planet today than most people could even begin tobelieve. Many extraterrestrial races, not only the reptilians, operate in andaround the Earth on this or higher dimensions. Beings from Orion and thePleiades are among many races reported by abductees and researchers to beinteracting with humans. From what I hear from Brotherhood insiders who haveseen some of these extraterrestrials, the Orions (a cruel, but beautiful raceaccording to my contacts) have some kind of alliance with the reptilians, whichalso have connections with Orion. I am sure that the biblical angels were theWatchers, the reptilians, winged and otherwise. The very term ‘sons of the gods’is translated in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament, asangelos – angels. It appears from my research that there are different reptilianfactions: those who are more positive in their attitude to humanity and thosewho wish to dominate and control. They both became known as Watchers or angels,the latter as fallen angels. It could well be that the legends of St Michaelcasting the dragon onto the Earth for the final battle and St George defeatingthe dragon, relate to the long-standing conflict between the genuine whiteMartians and the reptilian Anunnaki. St Michael and St George are ancientPhoenician heroes from the very region of the world where the Anunnakiinstigated their crossbreeding programme and, for a long time, operated openlyas reptilians. In the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, we see theclear connection made between the being known as Satan and the serpent orreptile:“And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called theDevil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to earth andhis angels were cast down with him.”56[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212872]“…And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan,and bound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut it,and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more.”57[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos212968]In a Dead Sea Scroll fragment translated by the Hebrew scholar, Robert Eisenman,there is a description of a watcher called Belial (Bel?), who is described asthe Prince of Darkness and the King of Evil. He is said to be terrifying in hisappearance – like a serpent with a visage like a viper. One of the main angelicgroups in Hebrew lore is the Seraphim or ‘fiery serpents’ and the Watchers arevery much connected to the description of serpents. In the Persian teachingsthey also talk of a being they describe as ‘the old serpent having two feet’,just as the Book of Enoch features walking serpents. When you consider that theDraco royal leadership is said to be up to 12 feet tall and white skinned,indeed albino white, ‘whiter than snow’, it again relates to the very white skinof the giant Watcher-human hybrid babies described in the Book of Enoch andelsewhere. And, I should emphasise, the birth of the human-Watcher child in theBook of Enoch is that of Noah. If this be so, Noah is, in fact, a reptile-humanhybrid and many peoples have sought to claim descendence from Noah – descendencefrom the reptilian Watchers and Anunnaki. In Hebrew myth, the Nefilim aredescribed as awwim which means devastators or serpents. In the Dead Sea Scrolls,Noah is described as looking like “the children of the (fallen) angels ofheaven” whose “conception was (due) to the Watchers… and to the Nefilim”. InJewish lore, Eve is seen as the ancestral mother of the Nefilim and associatedwith the Hebrew words meaning life and snake. Eve was, of course, tempted by theserpent according to Old Testament myth and other sources. In Chapter 69 of theBook of Enoch we find that among the Watchers who revealed the secrets to humanswas Gadreel, the fallen angel who has been identified with tempting Eve. TheBook of Enoch was banned by the Roman Church which sought to deny the earlierChristian belief in the existence of flesh and blood angels and fallen angelsoccupying physical bodies and interbreeding with humans. This was to stop themasses understanding the true situation. But the Freemasons, who control theRoman Catholic Church today along with other Brotherhood offshoots, have alwayslooked upon Enoch as one of their legendary founders. The very name Enoch means‘initiated’.The theme of the fallen angels giving forbidden secrets to humanity can be foundin the Book of Enoch and other works. Among these tellers of secrets is Azazel,who taught the art of metal making, and Shemyaza, who taught the magical arts.These tales spawned many later heroes based on this theme, the most famous ofwhich is the Greek god, Prometheus, who is said to have stolen fire (knowledge)from the gods and given it to humans (selected humans). A gold statue ofPrometheus stands in the Rockefeller Center in New York. The Rockefellers arereptilian full-bloods and therefore are fully aware of the true significance andbackground of the Prometheus legend. Incidentally, the Watcher called Azazel isthe origin of the goat head in Satanic ritual and the term ‘scapegoat’.According to the Book of Leviticus, the Israelites would sacrifice two malegoats at Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. One was offered to God and the otherto Azazel. The priest placed both hands on the head of the Azazel goat andconfessed the sins of the people. The goat would then be taken into thewilderness and plunged over a cliff, symbolising the fallen angel Azazel, whowas seen as bound and chained in the wilderness – the ‘abyss’ in the language ofthe Book of Revelation – which I think is imprisonment in the lower fourthdimension. From this comes the ancient theme of the scapegoat which manifestedin one form as the symbolic story of ‘Jesus’. The goat head of Azazel, a fallenangel-reptilian, is symbolised by the inverted pentagram of Satanism.We can debate the details and we should because there is a vast amount ofinformation still to be uncovered. I have an endless stream of questions myself.But there are some emerging themes: extraterrestrial races have been visitingthe Earth with varying intent for probably millions of years and theirinterbreeding has created the many racial streams. In the distant past therehave been highly advanced technological civilisations based on thisextraterrestrial knowledge – a Golden Age as the ancients called it. Around450,000 years ago the Anunnaki arrived, a reptilian race led by the winged,albino-white Draco, and they sought to take over the planet. It is probable thatthey had by this time also settled and occupied Mars. For a long time theAnunnaki lived openly as reptilians, but for whatever reason, possibly hostilityfrom other extraterrestrial races and humanity, they literally went undercover.They set out to hijack the planet by appearing to be human. This included acrossbreeding programme which created human-reptilian hybrid bloodlines throughwhich they could operate from the lower fourth dimension. The fourth dimensionalreptilians wear their human bodies like a genetic overcoat and when one bodydies the same reptilian ‘moves house’ to another body and continues the Agendainto another generation. You could think of it as wearing and discarding spacesuits. These creatures are the ones the psychics see as reptilians inside humanphysical bodies. It seems that they need to occupy a very reptilian dominatedgenetic stream to do this, hence certain bloodlines always end up in thepositions of power. Other less pure crossbreed human-reptilians are those bodieswhich are possessed by a reptilian consciousness from the fourth dimension andthese are people who psychics see as essentially human, but ‘overshadowed’ by areptilian. The crossbreeding to infuse reptilian genetics into these bloodlinesmakes this possession far easier than for those with fewer reptilian genes. Thisis why the Brotherhood maintains such detailed records of the genetic lines.They then know which people can be possessed more easily than others. Thereptilians seek, however, to influence everyone by stimulating the behaviourpatterns of the reptile region of the brain – hierarchical thinking, aggression,conflict, division, lack of compassion and a need for ritual. By ritual I don’tjust mean dressing up in a Satanic ceremony. There are many examples of thehuman obsession with ritual, including doing the same things at the same time,day after day, week after week. The reptilians have used the white race as theirmain route to global control, but they have crossbred with all races includingthe Chinese, Japanese, Arabs and those known as Jewish. Credo Mutwa says thatthe black royal lines of Africa claim decendence from the same origins – thegods – as the white aristocracy and that the leaders who emerge in Africa tothis day turn out to be of these same bloodlines. All this allows the reptiliansto control apparently unconnected people and organisations. It is theextraterrestrial version of members of the same secret society working in manyplaces of influence, while the rest of the population have no idea that they areconnected. You can look at a series of apparently different human beings indifferent positions of power who come to the same conclusion and agree the samepolicy. That would appear to be a policy born of democracy and open debate. Butwhat if the same force is controlling all of them? That would then bedictatorship, but unless you knew the true situation how could you tell? This iswhat is happening with the reptilians working through human bodies and thesecret society network these bloodlines have created or infiltrated.The Book of Enoch says that those born of the Nefilim blood (the reptile-humanhybrids) are, because of their ancestral spirit, destined to “afflict, oppress,destroy, attack, do battle and work destruction on the earth”.58[../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos213060] In other words, those bodies can bepossessed by their ‘ancestral spirit’ – the reptilians of the lower fourthdimension. In the United States there is an organisation called the Sons ofJared, named after the father of Enoch. They pledge an ‘implacable war’ againstthe descendants of the Watchers who “as notorious pharaohs, kings and dictators,have throughout history dominated mankind”. In their publication, the JarediteAdvocate, they condemn the Watchers as “like super-gangsters, a celestial Mafiaruling the world”.59 [../Text/index_split_013.html#filepos213228] Many peopleask me how today’s Brotherhood Elite can cause such death, destruction andsuffering, without showing any emotion. At least some of the reptile geneticstreams do not appear to feel emotion like humans and they seem to be far moreruthless, too. I’ve just described George Bush, Henry Kissinger, DavidRockefeller, the Queen of England and so on, and that’s not surprising becausethey are examples of the reptile race at work in the human sphere.What I have outlined in this chapter will astonish even most of those who havefollowed my work and supported it over the years, and I understand that. But Ihave learned from enormous, and at times extreme, experience to follow the flowof life and go where it takes me. When I feel the rhythm of life, I dance. WhenI hear it speak to me, I listen. I go where the music takes me, no matter howincredible it may be or what consequences it may have for my life. For those whohaven’t tried that yet, you will be amazed at what an adventure life suddenlybecomes, what knowledge you can access, grasp and understand, when you go withthe flow and cease to wage war with it for fear of being different. For mostpeople so often the head gets in the way because they fear stepping outside ofconvention. They fear what other people will think and say about them. But howcan you expose the unthinkable unless you think the unthinkable? Are we sayingthat we know it all? Is there nothing left to know? Of course there is. We knowonly a fraction of it all. And what has been the force that has brought us evento our current state of knowledge? Those who have dared to think and communicatethe unthinkable. Without such people the human race cannot evolve; it just runson the spot, living within a perpetual prison of the mind. What was that theysaid? Humans will fly? Ridiculous! That we can travel beyond the speed of sound?Crazy! That we can create babies in a test tube and clone the human and animalspecies? Ludicrous! Yet all and more have been done by those who have thoughtthe unthinkable while the masses mocked. Give it a try before you forget how todo it. Think beyond the bounds of what you are told is reality.To refuse to do so is the ultimate prison cell, the ultimate mental andemotional stagnation – the ultimate control. Indeed it is the way we have beencontrolled since this whole scam began."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_012.html#filepos93730] Dr Arthur David Horn, Humanity’sExtraterrestrial Origins, ET Influences On Humankind’s Biological And CulturalEvolution (A and L Horn, PD Box 1632, Mount Shasta, California, 96067, 1994).2 [../Text/index_split_012.html#filepos95773] Jason Bishop III, Matrix 11,compiled by Valdamar Valerian (Arcturus Book Service, USA, 1990), p 96.3 [../Text/index_split_012.html#filepos97931] Rev John Bathhurst Deane, TheWorship Of The Serpent (J.

They settled on the lowlandsand plains and began to rebuild. This was when Sumer, Egypt and the civilisationin the Indus Valley suddenly appeared at a very high level of technologicaladvancement, although they had existed before and were now restored after theupheavals.The Sumerian society began at the peak of its development because of this suddeninfusion of knowledge and the white Aryan race, originally from Mars, expandedout from the Caucasus Mountains and the Near East down into Sumer, Egypt and theIndus Valley where, as even conventional history agrees, highly advancedsocieties spontaneously emerged. However within this white race, and othersalso, was a genetic stream I will call reptile-Aryan or reptile-human. (WheneverI use the term Aryan I am referring to the white race.) These were thecrossbreed bloodlines created from the genetic manipulation of the Anunnaki. Themajor centre for the reptile-Aryan bloodlines, in the ancient world after theflood waters receded, was Babylon in the south of the Sumer region alongside theRiver Euphrates. A closer look at the evidence appears to date the foundation ofBabylon far earlier than previously believed and it was one of the first citiesof the post-flood era. It was here that the mystery schools and secret societieswere formed which were to span the globe in the thousands of years thatfollowed. The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modernexpression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-Aryan priests and ‘royalty’which came together there after the flood. It was in Babylon in this post-floodperiod from around 6,000 years ago that the foundation beliefs – manipulatedbeliefs – of today’s world religions were established to control and rule thepeople.The founder of Babylon according to ancient texts and legend was Nimrod whoreigned with his wife, Queen Semiramis. Nimrod was described as a ‘mightytyrant’ and one of the ‘giants’. The Arabs believed that after the flood it wasNimrod who built or rebuilt the amazing structure at Baalbek in the Lebanon withits three stones weighing 800 tons each. It was said that he ruled the regionthat is now Lebanon and, according to Genesis, the first centres of Nimrod’skingdom were Babylon, Akkad and others in the land of Shinar (Sumer). Later heexpanded further into Assyria to build cities like Nineveh where many of theSumerian Tablets were found. Nimrod and Semiramis (or the beings those namessymbolised) were from the reptile bloodlines which also became known as Titans,the genetic streams of the reptile-possessed humans and the full bloodreptilians. This race of ‘giants’ or ‘Titans’ was said to have been descendantsof Noah, the baby described in the Book of Enoch (previously the Book of Noah)as being a Watcher-human hybrid with extremely white skin. The father of Nimrodin the text of Genesis was Cush, also known as Bel or Belus, who was thegrandson of Noah and son of Ham. Cush became known as the deity, Hermes, whichmeans Son of Ham.1 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos304916] Ham or Khemmeans the ‘burnt one’ and may have been connected to Sun worship.2[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305045] A great network of deities emergedfrom Babylon and its connections with Egypt.Nimrod and Semiramis have remained the key deities of the Brotherhood to thisday under many different names and symbols. Nimrod was symbolised as a fish andQueen Semiramis as a fish and a dove. Semiramis is likely to be symbolic ofNinkharsag, the creator of the reptile-human crossbreeds. Nimrod was thefish-god Dagon who was depicted as half man, half fish.3[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305128] This was symbolic of him being halfhuman, half scaled reptile. Queen Semiramis was also symbolised as a fishbecause the Babylonians believed fish to be an aphrodisiac and it became thesymbol for the Goddess of Love.4 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305211]But the key symbolism was fish scales = reptile. Hence the use of the fish inChristian symbolism and architecture. In her role as the ‘Holy Spirit’,Semiramis was pictured as a dove holding an olive branch and Semiramis means‘branch bearer’ as in ‘Ze’ (the) ‘emir’ (branch) and ‘amit’ (bearer).5[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305294] Note also the symbolism of this inthe story of Noah and the Great Flood, when the dove came back bearing an olivebranch. The return of the reptilians after the flood? The name, Semiramis, wasevolved from the earlier Indian deity, Sami-Rama-isi or Semi-ramis.6[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305377] A fish and a dove are two symbolsstill widely used in religious ritual and national ceremony, although most ofthe people involved have no idea of the true meaning. Sinn Fein, the politicalwing of the Northern Ireland terrorist group the IRA, has a dove as its symboland you find the dove on many of the sceptres held by the British monarch (seepicture section). Both organisations are modern fronts for the BabylonianBrotherhood and the doves symbolise Queen Semiramis. The dove to them is not asymbol of peace, but of death and destruction because of the reverse symbolismthe Brotherhood employs. If it is positive to the masses, it is negative to theBrotherhood, and this allows their negative symbols to be placed throughout thepublic arena. No-one complains because they have no idea what these symbols,like the dove, really represent.Semiramis was called the Queen of Heaven (also Rhea), the Virgin Mother of theGods, and sometimes known as the Great Earth Mother (Ninkharsag). She was alsoworshipped under the name Astarte ‘the woman who made towers’ and this couldrefer to the Tower of Babel (Babylon) which Nimrod is said to have built. Thebloodlines of European royalty came from the reptile-Aryan bloodlines of Babylonand the crown evolved from the horned headgear worn by Nimrod and probably, too,from sun worship, as we will see. The horns symbolised the monarch’s authorityand later became a metal headband with three horns symbolising royal power withdivine authority.7 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305608] This isrepresented by the symbol of the fleur-de-lis which you find throughout theregalia of modern royalty (see Figure 6 overleaf ). As I have mentioned already,the Draco ‘royal’ hierarchy, the winged albino whites, are said to have hornsand I’m sure this is the true origin of the horned headgear of ancient royalty.The classic depiction of the Devil also has Draco-like horns. Nimrod was giventhe title Baal (the Lord) and Semiramis was Baalti (My Lady). The Latin term formy lady is Mea Domina which in its corrupted Italian form became Madonna.8[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305719] Nimrod was represented in a dualrole of God the Father and Ninus, the son of Semiramis, and her olive branch wassymbolic of this offspring produced through a ‘virgin birth’. Ninus was alsoknown as Tammuz who was said to have been crucified with a lamb at his feet andplaced in a cave. When a rock was rolled away from the cave’s entrance threedays later, his body had disappeared. Heard that somewhere before? Thishusbandwife-son theme of Nimrod-Semiramis-and Ninus/Tammuz was also theOsiris-Isis-Horus mythology of the Egyptians with its equivalent in India, Asia,China and elsewhere. Much later it would be Joseph, Mary and Jesus. When theBabylonians held their Spring rites to mark the death and resurrection afterthree days of Tammuz-Ninus, they offered buns inscribed with a solar cross. Yes,even the hot cross buns of British Easter tradition come from Babylon. Eastercomes from another face of Queen Semiramis – Ishtar – and it is from this, andpossibly another Brotherhood deity, Ashtaroth, that we get the name of ‘Ashtar’as in ‘Ashtar Command’, a completely manipulated New Age belief in anextraterrestrial ‘hero’ who has come to save us. The Babylonian myths andsymbolism provided the foundations for all the major religions, especiallyChristianity. The Roman Church was the creation of the Babylonian Brotherhoodand the Pope still wears a mitre shaped like a fish head to symbolise Nimrod.This is also the significance of his Fisherman’s Ring. The Chair of St Peter inthe Vatican was claimed to be a holy relic, but in 1968 it was exposed by ascientific commission as being no older than the 9th century. Moresignificantly, according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, is that it is decoratedby twelve plates portraying the twelve labours of Hercules. This same workclaims that Hercules was another name for Nimrod before becoming a deity of theGreeks.9 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305802] In 1825, Pope Leo XIIauthorised the production of a jubilee medal and it depicted a woman in a posethat was blatant symbolism of Queen Semiramis. She had a crucifix in her lefthand, a cup in her right and on her head was a seven rayed crown like the one onthe Statue of Liberty, another depiction of Semiramis which was given to NewYork by French Freemasons. A contact who has relatives working in high positionsin the Vatican told me how, during the reign of Pope John Paul II, he was givena guided tour of the place which blew his mind. He was shown the Pope’s solidgold bath which is decorated with all the astrological symbols and he saw insidethe vacuum-sealed vaults which contain thousands of ancient esoteric books whichhave been stolen and hoarded over hundreds of years of religious dictatorshipand so taken out of public circulation. The Roman Church and the BabylonianBrotherhood are one and the same.[../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 6: The Fleur-de-lis, symbol of the Babylonian trinity of Nimrod, QueenSemiramis and Tammuz, among other things.Nimrod was also Eannus, the god with two faces, who was later known to theRomans as Janus. One of the Anunnaki brothers, Enki the ‘serpent god’, was alsoknown as Ea, a name you can see throughout the African tradition. TheFreemasonic eagle with two heads looking left and right, east and west, issymbolic of Nimrod in the role of Eannus, and I would suggest that the eagle is,in part, symbolic of the winged Draco. Eannus, it was said, held the keys to thedoors of heaven and he was the sole intermediary between God and humanity,therefore any belief not supported by him was false and should be condemned.This was a wonderful tool for the Babylonian priesthood to impose their will onthe populous and exactly the same scam has been played by their successors, theChristian priests, the Rabbis and the priesthoods of Islam, Hinduism and all therest. The Roman Catholic title of cardinal comes from the word ‘cardo’ meaninghinge and relates to Nimrod’s role as guardian of the door to heaven.10[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305885] The Babylonian priests evenestablished a governing body they called the Grand Council of Pontiffs, a namelater transferred to the Church of Rome.11[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos305969] The Babylonian High Priest, whoinstructed the inner circle initiates, was known as… Peter, meaning the ‘GreatInterpreter’. The feast day of the Christian St Peter was traditionallycelebrated on the day the Sun entered the astrological house of Aquarius, thevery day that Eannus and Janus were honoured!12[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306053] The Babylonian religion, like allthe look-alikes that were to follow, consisted of two levels. The masses weremanipulated into believing superstitions and into taking symbolic storiesliterally, while the chosen initiates were given the real knowledge on penaltyof death if they ever revealed it. In this way the truth about life, humanpotential, history and the reptilian Agenda, were lost to the population andkept only for the few.Human sacrifice was fundamental to the religion of Babylon and wherever theBabylonian Brotherhood and their reptilian bloodlines have travelled, humansacrifice has always gone with them because the reptilians demand these rituals.The malevolent ones seem to be addicted to blood and this has been passed on totheir crossbreeds as the evidence I shall present will show. The Babylonianpriests were required to eat some of their sacrificial offerings and so the wordfor priest, Cahna-Bal, became the term for eating human flesh, cannibal.13[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306137] Moloch, the name of that flyinglizard I mentioned earlier, was another name for Nimrod-Tammuz. Tam means ‘toperfect’ and muz means ‘to burn’. You can see the symbolism of Tammuz-Moloch,therefore, in the rituals of burning children alive in honour of this deitywhich, staggeringly, still go on today. The Beltane ritual later performed inBritain by the Druids on May 1st, May Day, involved the burning of children inthe belly of a huge wicker effigy of a man. This was inherited from theBabylonians when the Brotherhood expanded across Europe. Indeed it may well bethat the reptilians had once based themselves in what is now the United Kingdomand Ireland before they moved their main focus to the Near East and Africa. TheFeast of Tammuz was on June 23rd and celebrated his ascension from theunderworld. When he was resurrected, Tammuz was known as Oannes, the fish god,and Oannes is a version of the name, John.14[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306221] For this reason, John has been usedas a symbol for Tammuz-Nimrod in symbolic characters like John the Baptist. June23rd, the Feast of Tammuz, became the Christian day called St John’s Eve! TheNimrod-Semiramis combination has been depicted under countless names in thecivilisations and cultures which have followed. These deities throughout theworld may seem to be an unfathomable tidal wave of names, but they areoverwhelmingly different names for the same two figures. Another deity widelyused in Satanism for the sacrifice of children today is Kronos, the king of theCyclops in Greek legend. He was known as the tower builder and is almostcertainly another version of Nimrod, the builder of the biblical Tower ofBabel.15 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306305]The reason the reptile bloodlines are involved in such unspeakable ritual andpractice today, is quite simply because they always have been. When you followthese bloodlines across history, you find they use the same rituals andsacrifice to the same deities, right to the present day. Another passage in theBook of Enoch tells of the Watchers breeding with human women and the behaviourof the offspring they produced:“And they became pregnant, and they bore great giants… who consumed all theacquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giantsturned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birdsand beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’s flesh and drinkblood. The Earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.”16[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306389]That passage describes the bloodlines I am highlighting and they came togetherin the Babylonian Brotherhood which has since expanded across the planet. Whilewe look out of our eyes and feel part of this physical world, the reptiles lookinto this third dimension, much like someone looking through a window. In thiscase, the eyes of the physical body. We are consciously in the third dimension,they are consciously in the fourth looking into the third. When you know whatyou are looking for it is the eyes that give them away. They are dark, piercingand cold. The reptile full-bloods are not attached to their bodies like humans.They are knowingly using them as ‘space suits’ to operate in this world, andwhen one wears out they simply occupy another. It is from this process of‘possession’ by the reptilians and other low vibrational entities that we havethe ancient tales, indeed modern ones too, of demons, devils and evil spiritstaking over a human mind and body. It is the reptilians and other consciousnessof the lower fourth dimension, the cesspit vibration as I call it, which aresummoned during Satanic, black magic rituals and it is during these rituals thatmany unsuspecting puppets are ‘plugged in’ to the reptilian consciousness andtaken over. So it was in Babylon and so it is today. As I revealed in I Am Me IAm Free, and will elaborate upon in this book, the Brotherhood hierarchy todayare seriously into Satanic ritual, child sacrifice, blood drinking and otherabominations that would take your breath away. Yes, I am talking about some ofthe biggest royal, political, business, banking and media names on the planet.People like Henry Kissinger, George Bush, the British royal family and manyother presidents, prime ministers and members of royalty. Fantastic? Of courseit is, but since when did the truth not sound fantastic in a world of suchdenial and illusion?Three of the principle elements of the Babylonian religion were fire, serpentsand the Sun. I should explain their focus on the Sun because it is a vital partof the story. Most of the global population worshipped the Sun for its obviousgifts of heat and light and the effect this had on their crops and well-being.However, within the hierarchy of the Babylon Brotherhood and other Elite groupswhich had the advanced knowledge, they focused on the Sun for other reasons too.They understood the true nature of the Sun as a multidimensional consciousnesswhich extends across the solar system on unseen frequency levels. Even in thisphysical dimension, the Sun’s emissions of magnetic energy are constantlyaffecting us second by second. The Sun has a diameter of some 864,000 miles andcontains 99% of the matter in the Solar System.17[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306495] It is an immense ball of energywhich works very much like an atomic bomb and the internal temperature can reachas much as 14 million degrees centigrade.18[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306680] It rotates faster at the equatorthan at the poles and therefore the activity and stimulation of the Sun’smagnetic field is simply colossal. The writer and researcher Maurice Cotterellhas made a long and detailed study of sunspot and solar flare activity when theSun is projecting immensely powerful magnetic energy. This has been photographedas gigantic loops of fire, some 100,000 miles high.19[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306764] This energy travels to the Earth onthe solar wind and it can affect computer systems and cause power blackouts. Butfor the Van Allen Belts, the zones of radiation which surround the planet andconnect with the Earth’s magnetic field, the Sun’s energy would ‘fry’ us.Maurice Cotterell studied the sunspot cycles and established short, long andgreat cycles of solar activity, as he explains in his book with Adrian G.Gilbert called The Mayan Prophecies. 20[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos306848] When Cotterell’s research wasalready advanced, he came across the amazing mathematical system of numbers andsymbols left by the ancient Maya people in Central America. The Maya claimed tohave originated with the ‘gods’ and recognised a lost island as their formerhome. Their astonishingly accurate mathematical and astronomical systems, andtheir measurement of time, were inherited from much older cultures andultimately from the extraterrestrials. We have already seen that MexicanPresident Miguel De La Madrid claimed that the Mayans were interbred with thereptilians, the ‘iguana race’ as he put it.Maurice Cotterell was fascinated to realise that the Mayan cycles of humanevolution corresponded remarkably with his sunspot cycles of magnetic emissions.Even over thousands of years, they were incredibly close. This is perfectlyexplainable. Everything is energy. Life is the interaction of magneticvibrational fields. Change the magnetism and you change the nature of the energyfield. Change the energy field and you change the nature of mental, emotional,spiritual and physical life, all of which are the same energy in differentforms. The other planets do this as they circle the Sun and affect the magneticfield of the Earth: we call this astrology. Cotterell believes that we areeffected by these fields most powerfully at the time we are conceived ratherthan the time we are born, a point which has much validity. I feel that bothpowerfully affect us. His research established that sunspot activity correspondswith the human fertility cycles and with the emergence and demise of greatcivilisations and empires. Scientists have also discovered that humans have aninternal clock which is in sync with the Sun. In short, the Sun’s effect onhuman life is fundamental and far beyond its obvious contribution of warmth andlight. The extraterrestrials knew this in these ancient times and the Sun wasviewed with awe. It is the physical and spiritual heart of the solar system andit came to symbolise the creator, particularly the male aspects of the creativeforce… ‘He Who Is The Light Of The World’. This knowledge of the Sun will be acommon theme throughout the rest of this book as we journey through history tothe present day. It does, however, make the decoding of history a little morecomplex because the ancients would constantly use Sun and astrological symbolismin their stories and some of the names for their gods would be used to symbolisethe Sun and the planets. Working out what is literal and what is symbolic is aconsiderable challenge. I also think that the term ‘Sun god’ has been used, inpart, to symbolise the extraterrestrials and their crossbreeds, who were said inthe ancient texts to have faces which shone like the Sun – the Shining Ones.This phenomena of reptilian beings who “shine” and glow is described by CredoMutwa in the video The Reptilian Agenda Part One. Imagine the power you wouldhave to advance an Agenda and manipulate the human race if you knew the cyclesof energy from the Sun and other planets and how they were likely to affecthuman consciousness. You would know when people would be more prone to anger,aggression, fear, doubt and guilt, and therefore when to have your wars,economic collapses and so on. The Brotherhood have always had this knowledge andthey use it to great effect today as I shall document.The Babylonian Brotherhood and its reptilian bloodlines expanded across theMiddle and Near East, especially to Egypt, and eventually into Europe and theAmericas. I think the early Egyptian civilisation after the Venus upheavels wasthe work of the Aryans from Mars, the Phoenicians, with or without the reptilianAnunnaki. But before 2,000 BC the reptilians were taking over. The Royal Courtof the Dragon was founded by the priests of Mendes in around 2,200 BC and thisstill exists today as the Imperial and Royal Court of the Dragon Sovereignty.The author, Laurence Gardner, is the present Chancellor of the Imperial Court ofDragon Sovereignty and his postal address in Devon, England is at Colomba House.Columba = dove = Queen Semiramis. According to Gardner, the name Dracula means‘Son of Dracul’ and was inspired by Prince Vlad III of Transylvania-Wallachia, aChancellor of the Court of the Dragon in the 15th century. The prince’s fatherwas called Dracul within the Court. Dracul = Draco. Wherever they went, theBabylonian Brotherhood created their own mystery schools to manipulate thepopulation into believing a nonsense and into giving away their power throughsuperstition and fear. At the same time the higher levels of these pyramidstructures communicated the advanced knowledge to those who would serve thereptilian Agenda. Where other non-reptilian initiation schools existed, theywere infiltrated and taken over by the Babylonian priesthood. Mystery schoolshave been around for tens of thousands of years, probably hundreds of thousands,and they are used to pass on advanced knowledge to those the hierarchy andpriests decide are worthy enough. In his book, The Masters Of Wisdom, J. G.Bennett writes of how the Russian mystic, Gregori Gurdjieff, told him that themystery schools went back at least 30,000 to 40,000 years.21[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307043] Gurdjieff said he had learned thisfrom cave drawings in the Caucasus Mountains and Turkestan (that area again). Ioften hear New Age people scream with indignation at the thought that theancient mystery schools were part of the manipulation. Well, first of all thereshould be no structures, whatever their intent, that deny knowledge to people. Idon’t care what their intent may be, once you consider it your right to denyknowledge and decide who should and should not have access to it, you areplaying a very dangerous and arrogant game. There were those of positive intentwho wanted to use the mystery schools to give the knowledge to people theybelieved would use it wisely and I am not suggesting that all these schools weremalevolent, certainly not. But even the positive ones were eventuallyinfiltrated by the servants of the reptilians. As Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonichistorian, wrote:“While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil,there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or blackmagic, (In Egypt)… the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise theirsuperhuman powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the moralsof the primitive Mysteries… they usurped the position formerly occupied by theinitiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government.“Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectual andspiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete andunhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priestcraft. ThePharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council – a committee ofarch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.”22[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307167]The black magicians that Hall says were formerly in Atlantis were, for me, thereptilian-human hybrids of what I call the Babylonian Brotherhood. It is theirsecret society network that now spans the globe and operates in literally everycountry. It allows the coordination of the Agenda across national borders andbetween apparently unconnected companies and institutions like politics,banking, business, the military and the media. Knowledge is not good nor bad, itjust is. It is how we use that knowledge that is positive or negative. At theupper levels of this network they know of the true power of the Sun, magneticsand the mind; the effect of the planets on human behaviour; how to manipulatetime, consciousness, energy, the weather and so much more. If used malevolently,this knowledge can be incredibly destructive and manipulating and this is whathas happened. At the same time the reptilians have used their secret societiesto create institutions in the public arena such as religions and politicalparties to suck this advanced knowledge out of circulation. The Inquisition wasa wonderful example of this technique. Merely to speak about esoteric matterswas to sign your own death warrant. This scam has been so effective that stilltoday you have Christians condemning esoteric information as ‘the Devil’ whenthis same knowledge is the very foundation of their religion. If you want toknow where Christianity really came from, stick around. It is recycled Paganismand provably so. Yet Christianity has been used quite brilliantly as the majorvehicle for removing vital knowledge from the public domain. WheneverChristianity and other religions took control of a country or region, theancient texts and records were removed or destroyed. This took out ofcirculation the very knowledge the reptilians have used and still use tomanipulate an ignorant population. It was also in the name of Christianity thatmost of the accounts of the true history of humankind have been destroyed, alongwith knowledge of the influence on human affairs of extraterrestrial races,positive and negative. This allowed an alternative invented ‘history’ to bewritten which has delinked humanity from its origins. Controlling history is soimportant because if you manipulate how people see what we call the past, youwill influence massively how they see the present.The themes I have highlighted so far, along with the deities and symbols, willtravel with us from here to the present day as we follow the expansion of theBabylonian Brotherhood across the world. Invariably, the Babylon reptilianfull-bloods and hybrids manipulated themselves into the positions of power andinfluence in the countries where they settled. They had a much higher level ofknowledge than most of the people and, as vehicles for the fourth dimensionalreptilians, there was already a long term plan to work to, the Great Work ofAges as it became known to the Freemasons. They allowed the non-reptilianpopulation to do the work and then, when new societies were established, theBrotherhood priests and initiates would hijack the positions of religious andpolitical power and ensure that any advanced knowledge in circulation was suckedout of the public domain and into their mystery schools and secret societies.The white race and the reptile-Aryan crossbreeds had emerged from the CaucasusMountains and the mountains of Iran and Kurdistan after the flood to settle inEgypt, Israel/Palestine and what we now call Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran andTurkey, going up to the Caucasus Mountains (see Figure 7). Significantly it wasfrom this same region that all the world’s major religions emerged and this isno accident. In earlier times, the civilisations of Sumer, Babylon and Assyriawere in the general area of what we call Iraq, while Turkey was previously knownas Asia Minor and Persia. Richard Laurence, the Archbishop of Cashel, whotranslated the first English edition of the Book of Enoch from the Ethiopian,established from the descriptions of the longest day of the year, that theauthor of the text had to have lived in the Caucasus region and not Palestine,as most people believed.23 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307375] This waswhere the main reptile-human bloodlines emerged from and the original text ofthe Book of Enoch was the much older Book of Noah, the reptilian crossbreed. TheAryan race as it expanded into new territory was known under various names, themost significant of which were the Hittites and Phoenicians. I think there wereother Aryan settlements outside this region, possibly Britain among them, andcertainly the reptilians were operating in other parts of the world, like theAmericas. But this mountainous region around the Caucasus and down to the plainsof Sumer and Egypt is a key to the true history of humankind over the last seventhousand years.The Caucasus Mountains came up again and again in my research and howappropriate that in North America white people are known as ‘Caucasian’. Evenaccording to official history it was a white ‘Aryan’ race from the CaucasusMountains region which moved into the Indus Valley of India about 1550 BC andcreated what is today known as the Hindu religion. It was this same Aryan race(they called themselves ‘Arya’) which introduced the ancient Sanskrit languageto India and the stories and myths contained in the Hindu holy books, the Vedas.L. A. Waddell, in his outstanding research into this Aryan race, establishedthat the father of the first historical Aryan king of India (recorded in theMaha-Barata epic and Indian Buddhist history) was the last historical king ofthe Hittites in Asia Minor.24 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307492] TheIndian Aryans worshipped the Sun as the Father-god Indra, and theHittite-Phoenicians called their Father-god Bel by the name, Indara.25[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307639] Under many names this same Aryanpeople also settled in Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and Asia Minor, now Turkey, andother Near Eastern countries, taking with them the same stories, myths, andreligion. This is why, as we shall see in detail later, all the major religionstell the same tale but using different names. They all come from the samesource, this Aryan race, which seems to have originated on Mars, and thereptile-human bloodlines operating covertly within them. What we call the Jewishrace also originated in the Caucasus region and not, as claimed, in Israel.Jewish historical and anthropological sources have shown that only a few of thepeople known as Jewish have any genetic connection to Israel. In the 8th centurya people called the Khazars living in the Caucasus Mountains and southern Russiahad a mass conversion to the Jewish religion. Later when that empire folded,these same people made their way north over a long period of time to settle inother parts of Russia, Lithuania and Estonia. From there they entered WesternEurope and eventually the United States. The Rothschild family is one of thesebloodlines. So is Henry Kissinger. These are the same people who justified thetakeover of Arab Palestine after the last war by saying that ‘God’ had giventhem an ancient right to that land as his ‘chosen people’. In truth theiroriginal homeland is the Caucasus region and southern Russia, not Israel. See…And The Truth Shall Set You Free for a detailed and sourced account of thisstory and the secret society manipulation that was behind the creation ofIsrael, or Rothschild-land as it really is.[../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 7: The Land of the Gods in the ancient world from where the Aryan andreptile-Aryan bloodstreams emerged in the Caucasus Mountains, Sumer, Babylon,and Egypt. There were other advanced peoples in other parts of the world,however, not only here.[../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 8: The Aryans and the reptile-Aryans expanded by sea and land into Europeunder many names, and especially thanks to the ‘British’ Empire, they wouldeventually take over the world.The white race expanded northwards into Europe. The first people went by seaunder the name, the Phoenicians, and over many centuries others migrated overland (see Figure 8). Two of the latter groups were called the Cimmerians and theScythians and through a series of name changes these same bloodlines populatedEurope and reconnected with the earlier Aryan settlers of Britain and NorthernEurope who had been installed by the seafaring Phoenicians. The Phoenicians arecrucial to the story and I will come to them in detail in a moment. TheCimmerians migrated north west from the Caucasus and Asia Minor (Turkey) intothe countries we now call Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. TheRoman historians, Pliny and Tacitus, said that all the people along the coastfrom the Netherlands to Denmark were the same ethnic group and this is supportedby archaeological evidence which indicates that this people arrived in thatregion about 300 to 250 BC. Another group of Cimmerians travelled up the RiverDanube through Hungary and Austria into southern Germany and France. The Romanscalled them Gauls and the Greeks knew them as the Keltoi or Celts. Groups ofthese Celtic tribes also settled in Bohemia and Bavaria and others invadednorthern Italy. Sallust, the Roman historian, records how Romans were defeated anumber of times by the ‘Cimbri’, who he says were Gauls. Other Roman historianssay the Cimbri were ‘Celts’. They were divided into three tribes, the Belgae(north east France), the Gauls (central France) and the Acquitanae (southernFrance to the Pyrenees Mountains). By the second century BC, the Gauls/Celts(the white Cimmerians from the Caucasus Mountains and the Middle East) occupiedall of central Europe and northern Italy and they went on to conquer the wholeof that country. Around 280 BC they swept down into Asia Minor and reoccupiedthe lands of their ancestors. As the historian Professor Henry Rawlinson said:“These two great invasions into Asia Minor proceeded from the same identicalrace, in the first instance called the Cimmerians and in the second, theGauls.”26 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307729] These invading Gaulsbased themselves in a place called Phrygia which became known as Galatia(Gaul-atia) and it was to these people that St Paul was supposed to have writtenin the New Testament’s Letter to the Galatians. The Cimmerians or Cimbri alsosettled in Wales and to this day the name for that country in the Welsh languageis Cymru.The Scythians, another Aryan group, also moved north from the Caucasus intoEurope where their name was changed by the Romans to distinguish between themand other peoples. The sacred emblems of the Scythians included the serpent, theOx (Nimrod/Taurus), fire (the Sun, knowledge), and Tho or Theo, the god theEgyptians called Pan. The Romans called the Scythians the Sarmatae and theGermani from the Latin word Germanus, meaning ‘genuine’. The Scythians wereknown, therefore, as the ‘Genuine People’ and of course from Germani we getGerman and Germany. The name change is confirmed by the writings of the Romanhistorians Pliny and Strabo. The Anglo-Saxons who invaded Britain were alsoknown as Germani by the Romans. The land called Old Saxony is modern day northGermany and the Netherlands. Both the Angles and the Saxons came from the samegenetic source – the white Cimmerians and Scythians from the Caucasus and theMiddle/Near East. It is the same with William the Conqueror and his Normans, thelast people to invade Britain in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings. The termsNorman and Normandy originate from the Norse (North) men because they came fromScandinavia to occupy that region of France. The story of the Scandinavian heroOdin, says that he came from Asaland or Asaheim, which just happens to be thelands of Scythia and can be identified in Aryan India. From there about 200 to300 AD, it is said, Odin led a huge army north to conquer Sweden. His army wascalled the Svear and in Swedish that country is still called Sverige, the Landof the Svear.Another group of Scythians, who became known as the Sakkas, went east from theCaucasus following the trail of the earlier Aryans and they reached the bordersof China by 175 BC. About this time Chinese records tell of a people called theSaiwang or Sok-wang who were forced to flee India. Sok-wang means ‘Sakkaprinces’. The records indicate that these Sakka retreated south into Indiathrough the mountain passes from Afghanistan, and coins dating from about 100 BCconfirm that a Sakka kingdom was created in the upper Indus valleys betweenKashmir and Afghanistan. Again it is not a coincidence that the religion ofBuddhism emerged from lands occupied by the Sakka (Aryan Scythians). At least by500 BC a tribe called the Sakyas lived in the area where Buddha is supposed tohave been born around 63 years earlier. Guatma (Lord Buddha) was calledSakyashina, Sakamuni, the Sakya sage, Sakya the teacher and the lion of thetribe of Sakya. All this will become highly significant when we look at thesingle origin of all the major, and most minor, religions and their ‘heroes’.The Scythian/Sakka and the Cimmerians/ Cimbri were in fact all the same peopleand this is confirmed by inscriptions scored into the Behistun Rock in theZargos Mountains on an old caravan trail from Babylon. The inscriptions wereordered by Darius the Great about 515 BC and they were written in threelanguages, Babylonian, Elamite and Persian. Whenever the Elamite and Persianversions say Sakka, the Persians/Babylonians use the term Cimiri.So these white Aryan peoples under different names with their same religion andreligious heroes under different names, expanded from their origins in theCaucasus and the Middle and Near East and went overland into Europe, India andas far as China. And within them were the reptile-human bloodlines who battledfor, and eventually won, supremacy to control the course of events as the kings,queens, priests and military leaders under the collective title I dub theBabylonian Brotherhood. That the Babylonians were part of the Aryan race isconfirmed by ancient inscriptions and titles. The Kassi or Cassi was a titlefirst used by the Phoenicians about 3,000 BC and this was adopted by theBabylonians who ruled the Mesopotamian empire. Kassi also appears as a personalname of Phoenicians in Egypt and Cassi was the inspiration for the ruling kingsknown as Catti in pre-Roman Britain, one of whom minted ‘Cas’ coins featuringthe sun-horse and other solar symbols.27[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos307933]This Aryan expansion began as far back as 3,000 BC, probably earlier, with theirseafaring branch, the Phoenicians. They were a technologically advanced peoplewho have been marginalised by official history and this has obscured their trueidentity. They are fundamental to understanding where we have come from andwhere we are now. It was they who brought both their genetic lines and theirknowledge to Europe, Scandinavia and the Americas, thousands of years BC. Theirstory is told by L. A. Waddell in his book, The Phoenician Origin Of Britons,Scots And Anglo-Saxons. Waddell was a fellow of the Royal AnthropologicalInstitute and spent a lifetime researching the evidence. He shows that thePhoenicians were not a Semitic race as previously believed, but a white Aryanrace. Examination of Phoenician tombs reveals that they were a long-headed Aryanrace and of a totally different racial type to the Semites. The Phoenicians ofthe ancient world travelled by sea from their bases in Asia Minor, Syria andEgypt to settle in the islands of the Mediterranean like Crete and Cyprus andalso Greece and Italy. It was the Phoenicians who carried the knowledge whichlater emerged as the civilisations of Minoan Crete, classic Greece and RomanItaly. They were also the ‘brains’ behind much of the Egyptian culture in thisperiod, before it was hijacked by the reptilians. The Egyptians knew thePhoenicians as the Panag, Panasa and Fenkha. The Greeks called them thePhoinik-as, and to the Romans they were the Phoenic-es.28[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308059] There is a simple reason why theEgyptians depicted many of their gods with white skin and blue eyes in exactlythe same way as other cultures all over the world did. This advanced race,called the Phoenicians, were white skinned and often had blue eyes – the same asthe reptilian-human crossbreeds and the same, it would appear, as the race fromMars. Thus we have the Scandinavian races, which were installed by thePhoenicians and other peoples of the same bloodstock and general location. It isalso the origin of the Aryan ‘Master Race’ nonsense which obsessed the Nazis andthe secret societies which created them. The hero of the Freemason secretsociety to this day is the mythical Hiram Abif, the so-called builder of KingSolomon’s Temple. Abif is supposed to have been a Phoenician. The grandfather ofthe famous Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, the father of Tutankhamen, was aPhoenician high priest. The Phoenix, the mythical bird of Egypt, was in fact theSun bird of the Phoenicians, the emblem of the Sun God, Bil or Bel, and as ithas been later symbolised, a peacock or an eagle.29[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308149] Evidence has emerged in recentyears about pyramids on Mars, when the NASA scientists, Vincent DiPietro andGregory Molenaar, discovered six enormous pyramids like those in Egypt in theCydonia region of Mars.30 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308239] It wouldmake sense that the same Martian race with the same knowledge would also buildpyramids when they came to Earth, and the same can be said of the Anunnaki if,as Zecharia Sitchin speculates and I agree, they had settlements on Mars.The Phoenicians were not confined to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Theylanded in Britain around 3,000 BC and unmistakable Phoenician artefacts havebeen found in Brazil, as well as possible Egyptian remains in the Grand Canyonin America. A man who has worked for ‘Her Majesty’ on covert projects told methat Phoenician remains have been found in the rainforests in northernQueensland, Australia, close to where Captain Cook landed on his journey of‘discovery’, a journey sponsored by the Freemason-dominated Royal Society. ThePhoenicians landed in the Americas thousands of years before the manufactured‘photo opportunity’ better known as the journey of an earlier ‘Captain Cook’,Christopher Columbus. The reason that the native legends of the Americas speakof tall ‘white gods’ coming from the sea bringing advanced knowledge is becausethat is precisely what happened, if you forget the gods bit. They were the Aryanrace and the reptile-Aryans from the east landing in the Americas thousands ofyears ago, the same Aryan race or ‘gods’ who the Sumerians said gifted themtheir civilisation after the flood. This is also why the later white invaderswho followed Columbus were astonished to find that the native peoples of theAmerican continent had the same basic religious stories and myths as they had.This is perfectly explainable now. They came from the same source – the Aryanrace known as the Phoenicians among many other names like Sumerian and Hittitewith the reptile-Aryan bloodlines within them. There also seems to have been adirect reptilian invasion in the Americas way back. The evidence of an advancedrace who knew the Americas existed, comes with centuries-old maps like the HadjiAhmed Portolan Map, compiled in 1519, which depicts the North American continentwith a wide causeway connecting Alaska and Siberia. There is also an accuratedrawing of an ice-free Antarctica.The arrival of the Aryan Phoenicians in Britain also appears to correspond withthe building of the great stone circles and observatories like Stonehenge andAvebury in Wiltshire. The advanced Phoenicians-Sumerians, who had a highlydeveloped knowledge of astronomy, astrology, sacred geometry, mathematics andthe Earth’s magnetic force line network known as the global energy grid, had allthe knowledge necessary to build these great structures. L. A. Waddell said thathe found Sumerian markings on one of the stones at Stonehenge.31[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308417] Professor Alexander Thom, EmeritusProfessor of Engineering Science at Oxford University from 1945 to 1961,discovered that the ancients who built Stonehenge knew about ‘Pythagorean’geometric and mathematical principles thousands of years before Pythagoras wasborn. Thom explained in his 1967 book, Megalithic Sites In Britain, that thestones not only formed geometric patterns in and around the circle, they alsoaligned to features in the surrounding landscape and to the positions of theSun, Moon and prominent stars at particular times, particularly where the Sunappeared or disappeared at the equinox or solstice and where the Moon was at theextreme positions of its cycle. It was a gigantic astronomical clock, he said.But it is more than that. It is a receiver and transmitter of energy. TheEarth’s magnetic grid, or grids, consist of lines of magnetic energy known asley lines, meridians or dragon lines to the Chinese. Where these lines cross,the energy spirals into a vortex and where many lines cross you have a massivevortex of energy. These are the power places, the sacred sites of the ancientswho knew of this system. The vortex, or spiral, is a constant throughout theUniverse. Our galaxy is a spiral, water spirals downwards, hair grows in aspiral at the crown, the DNA molecule which carries our genetic blueprint is adouble spiral. Brian Desborough, my scientist friend from California, told methere is a point on one of the Earth grids, the Hartmann Grid as it is called,where twelve of these force lines meet and go down into the Earth. Where wasthat? I asked. “A place called Avebury in England” he said. The very place theadvanced Phoenician-Sumerians chose to build their stone circles at least fivethousand years ago along with a series of surrounding sites, including SilburyHill, the biggest human-made mound in Europe, and others like West Kennet LongBarrow. These form a sort of ‘circuit board’ at the heart of the energy gridwhich fundamentally affects the nature of the Earth’s magnetic field. I livednear Avebury for two years and it is an incredibly powerful place if you aresensitive to energy. It is also the area where most of the ‘crop circles’ ormore accurately, crop formations, have appeared, particularly the most complexof them.Even more interesting is the apparent connection between Avebury and Mars. Thebest known researcher of the apparently man-made structure called the ‘Face onMars’ and an area of that planet known as Cydonia, is the American Richard C.Hoagland. He has been a science journalist, a director of planetariums in WestHartford and New York, and an advisor at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.Hoagland is the author of the book, Monuments On Mars. 32[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308543] I have no doubt that the same racethat built the structures in Cydonia, including pyramids, also built Stonehenge,Avebury and the pyramids at Giza. There is evidence, in fact, that Avebury couldbe a mirror image of the complex at Cydonia. When you take same scaletopographical maps of both places and superimpose one on the other, thecorrelation of objects and the distances between them is incredibly similar, asmembers of Hoagland’s team established. He also discovered that his ‘Mars City’was built according to the same laws used to create other similar complexes onthe Earth. The same mathematics, alignments and sacred geometry can be found inCydonia on Mars and in the great structures of the ancient world like those atStonehenge, the pyramids at Giza in Egypt, Teotihuacan in Mexico and inZimbabwe. These mathematics accord with the ‘Golden Mean’ geometry as depictedby the Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in his picture of the maninside a circle (see Figure 9). Da Vinci, as we shall see, was a leadinginitiate of the secret society network and this is how he was able to predictthe coming of the telephone, design flying machines and tanks, and designbicycles in the 15th and 16th centuries which look basically like the modernversion today.[../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 9: Leonardo da Vinci’s depiction of Man according to the sacred geometryknown as the Golden Mean.Another constant is the latitude of 19.5 degrees. This is the latitude on whichthe pyramids, many ancient temple complexes, and other sacred structures werebuilt. It is also where you will find the volcanoes on Hawaii, the Schildvolcanoes on Venus, the massive Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, the dark spot onNeptune, the red spot on Jupiter and the main area of sunspot activity, northand south, on the Sun.33 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308711] This allfits like a glove, because sunspots are emissions of incredibly powerfulelectromagnetic energy from the Sun, and volcanoes are obvious emissions ofenergy from the planets. Not surprisingly, therefore, 19.5 degrees is the pointof energy exchange between rotating spheres and the hierarchy of the ancientsknew this. The Sumerians knew, for instance, about the cycle of what is calledprecession. This is the effect of the Earth’s ‘wobble’ which slowly moves theplanet on its axis so that it faces different star systems or astrological‘houses’ over many thousands of years. As their records show, the Sumerians knewthat it took 2,160 years for the Earth to move through each ‘house’ and 25,920years to complete the cycle. We are completing one of these cycles now, hencethe enormous change that is upon us. Ancient temples all over the world reflectthese cycles of precession in their geometry and mathematics. Isn’t it amazingwhat ‘primitive’ people can do? The Elite of the Phoenician-Aryans had enormousknowledge of the Earth’s energy grid and its potential to affect humanconsciousness. After all, we live within the planet’s magnetic field. When itchanges, we change. If you live in water and the water changes, you arefundamentally affected and it is the same with the energy ‘ocean’ that weoccupy. Thus you have the movement of the planets affecting the Earth’s magneticfield and through that affecting us. The Brotherhood don’t want us to know anyof this and so they have used their religions, like Christianity, to condemnastrology as the work of the Devil and their ‘science’ to dismiss it asmumbo-jumbo.The ‘mystery’ stone circles and structures are much less mysterious when youseek answers with open minded research. The evidence strongly suggests that theywere built by the Phoenician-Aryans who came from the Middle and Near East. Itis the same with the ‘mystery’ white horses scored into the chalk hillsides ofBritain. Just before I wrote this chapter, I visited the oldest white horse inBritain, the famous one at Uffington in Wiltshire, not far from Avebury (seepicture section). The plaque said that its date of construction was about 3,000BC – exactly the period when the Phoenicians arrived in the British Isles. Whyshould the Phoenicians score white horses into the hillsides of Britain? Again,the answer is simple. Their religion was focused on the Sun and the white horsewas a Phoenician symbol for the Sun. The great stone circles and structuresthroughout Britain, like Stonehenge and Avebury, were built with the knowledgeheld by the ruling and priestly classes of the Phoenicians and the BabylonianBrotherhood which infiltrated and eventually controlled the Aryan leadership.This knowledge included the ability to use sound and other techniques to throw amagnetic field around a massive stone and delink it from the laws of gravity. Itthen becomes weightless. This period of around 3,000 BC is very significant.While the Phoenicians were at work in this period in Britain and elsewhere, thepyramids at Giza in Egypt have apparently also been dated to around 3,000 BCusing the latest carbon dating methods. Traces of charcoal found within themortar apparently made this possible.34[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308826] I still think that they may be mucholder, however.The Aryans of the Near and Middle East had many names, the Hittites, thePhoenicians, the Goths and so on. You can follow words and names through theseapparently different cultures to show that they came from the same source. Someof the stone circles are sometimes called Hare-Stones which, according to L. A.Waddell’s research, evolved through Harri or Heria, the title for the rulingGoths, and from the Hittite title of Harri, Arri or Aryan: Hare stones are Aryanstones. Just as Hari Krishna means Aryan Krishna, very appropriate given thatthe Hindu religion was the work of the Aryans. You also have Castlerigg stonecircle near Keswick in Cumberland. The word ‘rig’ was a title for Gothic kingsand princes and the Gothic came from the Aryans. Ancient depictions of Aryankings in Cilicia have them wearing the Gothic style of dress. The name ofKeswick itself means ‘Abode of the Kes’ – the Cassi or Khatti clan of theHittites – and the county of Cumberland has evolved through names like Cymry andCumbers from its origin, Sumer. The term Aryan comes from a Phoenician word,Arri, meaning ‘noble one’. Thus we get the names Sum-ARIAN and aristocracy orARIAN-stock-racy. The lion has always been a major symbol through the agesbecause it was an Aryan symbol for the Sun and was often placed at the entrancesto temples and sacred places. Hence the lion-bodied Sphinx which also relates tothe astrological sign of Leo, again considered in astrology to be the sign ruledby the Sun. The whole foundation of ‘British’ culture and legend came from thePhoenicians. The famous legend of St George and the Dragon comes from St Georgeof Cappadocia, the Phoenician centre in Asia Minor. The battles between StGeorge and the dragon could well have been symbolic of the Martian-reptilianconflicts which seem to go back a very long way. The red cross of St George(England) and the crosses of St Andrew (Scotland) and St Patrick (Ireland), andthe ensigns of Scandinavia, were all carried as sacred standards of victory bythe Phoenicians. The red cross was the fire cross, a Phoenician-Aryan symbol forthe Sun, as was the swastika, later used by the Nazis. A swastika can be seen ona stone dedicated to the Phoenician Sun-god Bel, which was found at Craig-Nargetin Scotland and was used to decorate the robes of their high priestesses (seeFigures 10 and 11). I read that the name swastika comes from the Sanskrit word,svasti, which means well-being, and it was considered a positive symbol untilthe Nazis turned it around and made it a symbol of destruction. L. A. Waddelltranslated the markings on another stone in Scotland, the Newton Stone in theDumfries and Galloway region, to be Phoenician-Hittite and dedicated to theirSun god, Bel or Bil. The classic British symbol of Britannia comes from thePhoenician goddess, Barati. Look at how the Phoenicians depicted Barati and howthe British depict Britannia in Figure 12! One of the major centres of theAryan-Hittite-Phoenicians was Cilicia in Asia Minor and here Barati wasworshipped as Perathea and later Diana. So Diana and Britannia originate fromthe same source. Barati was the queen/goddess figure of the Phoenicians as Baratwas the god/king. These are possibly names for the Babylonian deities Nimrod andSemiramis. The ‘royal’ élite clan of the Aryans were (are) called the Barats andthis is why you find the term Barat or Brihat in the ancient Indian culture asyou do with Britain and British (Barat-ain and Barat-ish). The Indian Vedas saythat “King Barat gave his name to the Dynastic Race of which he was the founder;and so it is from him that the fame of that Dynastic people hath spread sowide.”35 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos308938] Parat, Prat and Prydi, aresome of the other derivatives of Barat. The original form was Barat-ana orBrithad-ana.36 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309033] The suffix ana inHittite-Sumerian (Aryan) means ‘one’. Ana in fact evolved into the English word‘one’ and the Scottish ‘ane’. Barat-ana or Briton therefore means ‘One of theBarats’ (Bruits). It is the same with many other countries occupied by thiswhite race. The name Iran comes from the earlier Airy-Ana or Air-an, which meansLand of the Arrays or Aryans.37 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309158][../Images/00025.jpg]Figure 10: The swastika, the Phoenician sun symbol, on the PhoenicianCraig-Narget stone in Scotland and, Figure 11, on the robe of a Phoenician HighPriestess.[../Images/00026.jpg]Figure 12: The Phoenician depiction of Barati (right) and the British symbol ofBritannia. They are the same deity and alternative names for Queen Semiramis inBabylon and Isis in Egypt.The Indian Vedas also acknowledge the goddess Barati (Belonging to the Barats),and she was known as Brihad the Divine. They say her special place was on theSaras-vati River which happens to be the modern Sarus River in theHittite-Phoenician land of Cilicia. The river entered the sea at Tarsus, thealleged home of St Paul in the New Testament, a work written in accordance withAryan sun myths. Also, these Phoenicians and Aryans worshipped the serpent andthe shape-shifting reptilians called the Nagas were the serpent gods of theHindus. The Vedas, inspired by the Aryans, tell how the serpent-humans, theNagas, could cause fantastic damage and instant death. The Nagas were also saidto have appeared at the birth of the man who became known as Buddha and theserpent plays a part in the legend of Krishna. The Roman name for Barati wasFortune after her legend as the goddess of fortune. They depicted Fortune in thesame way as the Phoenicians symbolised Barati and the British do with Britannia.All were associated with water as you expect with a sea-faring race like thePhoenicians. The Egyptians, too, had a goddess called Birth, the goddess of thewaters, and she was another mirror of Barati because the Aryan-Phoenicians werethe force behind Egypt. Birth was described by a Babylonian emperor about 680 BCas “a Phoenician god across the sea”.38[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309242] In Crete, another Phoenician centreunder the title ‘Minoan’, their goddess was Brito-Martis. She was a Phoeniciangoddess according to Greek and Roman legend (Barati in other words) and thedivine daughter of Phoenix, the king of Phoenicia. Brito-Martis becameidentified with the goddess Diana, a major deity of the ancient world, and likeher she was armed for the hunt. As Earl Spencer made a point of emphasising atthe funeral of his sister Diana, Princess of Wales, she was named after theancient goddess of hunting.The early British kings called themselves and their race the ‘Catti’ and thisappears on their coins. The Aryan Hittites of Asia Minor and Syria-Phoeniciacalled themselves the Catti or Khatti. The race of Aryans who left the Caucasusto rule India were known as the Khattiyo. The term Khatti evolved through theHebrew and English translations into the Hittites of the Old Testament. Kassi orCassi was the title used by the first Phoenician dynasty about 3,000 BC and wasadopted by the Babylonian dynasty. Not surprising because these were differentbranches of the same people. The ancient Indian Epic king lists name some of thesame people named in the Mesopotamian king lists and the predynastic civilisersof early Egypt also turn out to be of the Aryan race. We are looking at the samepeople here, no doubt whatsoever, and within this race are the reptile-Aryanbloodlines which have increasingly held the reins of power from the ancientworld to the present day. As L. A. Waddell points out, the English, Scottish,Irish, Gaelic, Welsh, Gothic and Anglo-Saxon languages and their writing, andthe entire family of Aryan languages, derive from the Aryan Phoenician languagevia the Hittite and Sumerian. About half of the commonest words used in theso-called English language today are of Sumerian, Cyprian or Hittite origin withthe same sound and meaning. Sumerian, the language of the ‘gods’, is the parentlanguage for most of the world, although I think it originated somewhere elseeven further back in history, maybe Atlantis or even the area today called theBritish Isles. As Waddell says:“I had recognised that the various ancient scripts found at or near the oldsettlements of the Phoenicians, and (those known as) Cyprian, Karian, Aramaic orSyrian, Lykian, Lydian, Corinthian, Ionian, Cretan or “Minoan”, Pelasgian,Phrygian, Cappadocian, Cilician, Theban, Libyan, Celto-Iberian, Gothic Runesetc, were all really local variations of the standard Aryan Hitto-Sumerianwriting of the Aryan Phoenician mariners, those ancient pioneer spreaders of theHittite Civilisation along the shores of the Mediterranean and out beyond thePillars of Hercules to the British Isles.”39[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309332]Official history asks us to believe that the people of Britain were savages whowere ‘civilised’ only after the Romans came. This is not true and in fact theRomans said the opposite. Roman records say that the Britons were generallycivilised and their customs much the same as the Gauls. Of course they were.They were the same people with the same origins. The Britons used gold money andthere was trade with the European continent, as British coins of the periodfound there have confirmed. It was only the people of the interior of Britain,still uninfluenced by the Phoenician culture closer to the coasts, whom theRomans regarded as uncivilised when they arrived. Many of the roads regarded as‘Roman’ were not built by the Romans at all. They were pre-Roman roads whichthey repaired. The Romans admired the efficiency of the British armies,particularly their use of war chariots. You won’t be surprised to know by nowthat these famous ‘British’ chariots were the same as those used by the Hittitesor Catti described by the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II around 1,295 BC at theBattle of Kadesh, a Hittite-Phoenician port. In about 350 BC, three centuriesbefore the Romans arrived, the explorer and scientist, Pytheas, sailed aroundBritain and mapped the land scientifically with latitudes. Pytheas was a nativeof Phocca in Asia Minor, Phocca deriving from Phoenicia, as did an adjoiningport called Phoenice.40 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309422] By thistime the Phoenicians had organised the tin trade, from their mines in Cornwallin the west of England across Gaul/France to Marseilles, from where it was takenby sea to the lands of the Mediterranean and Aegean. The first Phoeniciantin-port in Cornwall was Ictis or St Michael’s Mount in Penzance Bay. StMichael, one of the great heroes of Christianity, was in truth a Phoeniciandeity.There is endless evidence to prove the ancient link between the British Islesand Ireland and the culture of North Africa and the Near East. They say if youwant to expose corruption, follow the money. Well if you want to identify thepassage of people and cultures, follow the language. The Irish language today isEnglish which replaced Gaelic and Gaelic itself evolved from a now lost earlierlanguage. Gaelic speaking missionaries in the Middle Ages had to useinterpreters to communicate with the Picts, the ancient people of what becameScotland, and Cormac, a Gaelic-speaking Irish king of the ninth century,referred to the language of the people of Munster in south west Ireland as the‘iron language’. But even Gaelic connects us very firmly into the Middle East.In Conamara, in the west of Ireland, is a community which still speaks Gaelic asits first language. Their sean-nos (old style) singing, the basis of all Irishmusic, is amazingly similar to the native songs of the Middle East. Even trainedears find it almost impossible to distinguish between the chants of the Gaelicsingers and those of Libyans. Charles Acton, the music critic of the IrishTimes, wrote:“If one listened for hours in the desert of an evening to Bedouin Arabs singingnarrative epics… and then returned to Ireland and heard a fine sean-nos singerusing the same melismata and rhythm, one finds the resemblance almost uncanny.So, too, if one listens to (the Spanish) “canto jondo”.41[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309512]There were major sea trading routes between Ireland and Spain and Spain andNorth Africa in ancient times through which the passage of bloodlines, knowledgeand culture was transported. The Spanish Arch in Galway in the west of Irelandcommemorates this, as does the Conamara dancing known as ‘the battering’ whichis virtually the same as Spanish Flamenco. The stick dance performed by theWexford Mummers in Ireland is of North African origin. The word ‘mummer’ comesfrom Mohammedan. The Irish symbol, the harp, came from North Africa and so didthe name of that other classic symbol of Ireland, the shamrock. Any three leafplant is known in Egypt as a shamrukh. The rosary beads, the symbol of devoutRoman Catholics, come from the Middle East and are still used by the Egyptians.Even ‘Saint’ Patrick, the mythical ‘hero’ who supposed to have broughtChristianity to Ireland, is merely a cover name for the Egyptian god, Ptah, fromwhich the name Patrick derives. In the same way Nimrod = John in Illuminatisymbolism, as in the secret society the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. Theword ‘nun’ is Egyptian and their garments are from the Middle East. According toArbois de Juvainville, the author of a work called Cours De Literature Celtigue,the Irish were known as ‘Egyptians’ in the Middle Ages. There are obviousconnections between Irish books and those of the Egyptians. They employ the samestyles of illustration and the colours used in the Irish Book of Kells and Bookof Durrow are of Mediterranean origin. The red used in these books came from aMediterranean insect, the Kermococcus vermilio, and others came from aMediterranean plant, the Crozophora tinctoria. The crossed arms pose of manyEgyptian portrayals of their god, Osiris, can be seen in Irish manuscripts. TheIrish sweaters made on the Isle of Arran carry, according to at least one experton the history of knitting, designs first given to them by Egyptian Copticmonks.42 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309778] The main blood group ofArran (Aryan?) is different from most of the Irish population. The old Irishsailing craft called pucan was invented by the North Africans and used on theNile. Excavations at Navan Fort, near Armagh City, found remains of the Barbaryape estimated to have lived about 500 BC. The Barbary ape today is mainlyassociated with Gibraltar, but its home in 500 BC was North Africa. Libyandragonskins (mercenaries) were believed to have been at large in Ireland 2,000years ago. In the second century, the geographer Ptolemy, who lived inAlexandria, could name sixteen tribes in Ireland. The Irish sport of hurling ismirrored by the game called Takourt in Morocco. Irish ritual was, like all thecultures inspired by the Phoenician-Aryans, focused on the Sun. The Earth moundat Newgrange in Ireland has a narrow passageway of some 62 feet which isperfectly aligned with the Sun as it rises on December 21st/22nd, the wintersolstice. So much so that the golden sunlight fills and illuminates the wholepassage and the chamber at the centre. The entrance to structures in theMediterranean, particularly the one at the Palace of Minos in Crete, are thesame. The distinctive Round Towers of Ireland are, according to someorientalists, of Phoenician origin.43[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos309951] Again all this fits perfectly intothe story I am revealing here. The Phoenicians came from the Middle and NearEast, one of the global centres for the Anunnaki-reptilians and, according tothe research of Professor Phillip Calahan I mentioned earlier, the round towersare aligned with stars systems in the northern sky – especially Draco.The connections between Ireland and the Berbers of Morocco deserves a specialmention. They are a light-skinned mountain people, some blue-eyed andblond-haired. They are associated with the Atlas Mountains which are themselvesassociated with Atlantis and named after Atlas, a son of the legendary ruler ofAtlantis, Poseidon. Berber art has many similarities to the Irish version andanyone speaking Gaelic could comfortably understand the Berber tongue. The mainBerber clans like M’Tir, M’Tuga and M’Ghill, are obvious origins or derivativesof the Ireland-Scottish MacTier, MacDougal and MacGhill. The term Mac means‘children or child of’ and the Arabs use the term Bini, as in Bini M’Tir, whichmeans the same. Missionaries who first explored the lands of the Berbers foundthat they used bagpipes, as do the Irish and Scots. Early invaders of Irelandwere known as the men with the leather bags. An Irish goatskin drum found inKerry is a twin of the Moroccan drum, the bindir. The violin and the guitar alsooriginate in North Africa. The Viking wing of the Aryans invaded Ireland andfounded many towns, including the present capital city of Dublin. But, notsurprisingly in the light of the evidence you have been reading, the famousViking galley with the high front and stern was a Phoenician design used by theEgyptians. Rock carvings at Newgrange appear to depict this design thousands ofyears earlier. The name Idris is well known in Wales and the saints and kings ofthe Muslims have been called Idris for centuries. In the British Museum is aMuslim coin, a gold dinar, which has the name ‘Offa’ stamped upon it. Offa wasthe King of Mercia in England in the 8th century and he is said to have builtthe 120 mile earth ‘wall’ between England and Wales known as Offa’s Dyke. Thename Wales comes from ‘Weallas’ meaning Land of Foreigners. The Welsh, like theIrish, explored the northern waters around Iceland before the Vikings and it issaid that the Welshman Prince Madoc went ashore in America three centuriesbefore Columbus. That’s very possible because if he had access to the knowledgeof the Phoenicians, he would have known that the Americas were there. TheVenerable Bede of Cymbri (approximately the Welsh) said they were an Easternpeople who migrated after the flood from the lands of the Bible to the BritishIsles.44 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos310053]When the Irish settled in parts of Wales and Cornwall, some of the displacedpeople moved to Armorica, now Brittany, on the French coast. There you find thefantastic forest of standing stones called Carnac, a name which comes fromKarnac in Egypt. The Breton language is a mixture of old Welsh and Cornish –Aryan. Brittany means Little Britain and relates again to Barat and Barati.Amorica means ‘land facing the sea’, a perfect description of America approachedfrom the Atlantic. This is surely the true origin of the name America, and notAmerigo Vespucci, the explorer from Florence who was the contractor forChristopher Columbus in Spain. The Isle of Man was also populated by the IrishAryans and it became a very sacred land. It was one of two places in Britain,Anglesea in North Wales was other, where the Arch Druids were based. These werethe highest ranked members of the ancient British priestly class, who inheritedtheir knowledge from the Phoenicians and later the Babylonian Brotherhood. TheIsle of Man’s three legs symbol is not unlike that ancient Phoenician symbol forthe Sun, the swastika. Irish connections with Ethiopia have also beenidentified. An American researcher, Winthrop Palmer Boswell, wrote a book calledIrish Wizards In The Woods Of Ethiopia in which she showed the similaritiesbetween Irish and Ethiopian folk stories. The baobab tree is held in greatreverence by Ethiopians and Berbers and ‘banba’ is an old name for Ireland.This reverence for trees in North Africa was expressed in the British Isles andEurope by the Druids and the giant or Titan race, the reptilian-humancrossbreeds of the ancient Near East, were often symbolised as trees because oftheir height. In his 1833 book, Phoenician Ireland, Joachim de Villeneuve,insisted that Irish Druids were the ‘snake priests’ of the Phoenician seafarers.This would certainly explain the origin of the Balor of the Evil Eye, the Irishversion of the North African god Baal, and the celebration on May 1st of theBaal ritual, Beltane. The evil eye relates to the hypnotic stare of thereptilians. The Sun god of the Phoenicians was Bel or Bil and later became knownby the Canaanites and Babylonians as Baal – Nimrod. The Druids became thecarriers of the mystery school tradition in Britain, Ireland and France orBritannia, Eire and Gaul as they were then called, and some of them becamedeeply corrupted by the influence of the reptile-human bloodlines of theBabylonian Brotherhood which established control of the Aryan priesthood as thecenturies passed. The origin of the word Druid is not certain. A Gaelic word,druidh, means ‘a wise man’ or a ‘sorcerer’, but it may come from the Irish word,Drui, which means ‘men of the oak trees’.45[../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos310203] The Druidic Mysteries were taughtin the darkness of caves, forests and groves with the oak tree symbolising theirSupreme Deity (very much in line with the Watcher tree-symbolism). They did notworship the oak tree, it was a symbol and anything which grew upon it, likemistletoe, became sacred. The holly bush was another sacred symbol of the Druidsand this is where we get the name Hollywood in Los Angeles, the centre of theglobal film industry which was created by modern initiates of the BabylonianBrotherhood. It has remained in their control and Hollywood is one of their mostimportant vehicles for mass mind conditioning. Hollywood is indeed a place ofmagic as it casts a spell on humanity’s perception of itself and the world. TheDruids knew about astrology and astronomy and they celebrated the birth of theSun on December 25th. The Moon was also very important to them. Particularlysacred was the night of the new Moon, the sixth day, and the full Moon.As with the Blue Degrees of modern Freemasonry, the Druid initiates were dividedinto three groups. The teachings given to each level in the forest groves ofancient times and the Freemasonic temples of today are virtually the same. Thefirst level of the Druid School was the Ovate who was dressed in green, theDruidic colour for learning. The second was the Bard, who wore sky bluerepresenting harmony and truth. They had the task of memorising some of the20,000 verses of Druidic poetry within which the mysteries were hidden. Thethird, the Druid, would be dressed in a white robe, their symbolic colour forpurity and the Sun. To become an Arch-Druid, a spiritual leader, you had to passsix levels of degree. The Druids had total power over the population for a longtime and some deeply unpleasant rituals emerged after their mystery schoolnetwork was taken over by the Babylonian Brotherhood. The basic moral code wastaught to all people, but the secret knowledge was, as with all these networks,preserved for initiates under the strictest secrecy. Eliphas Levi, the famousesotericist, said of their healing methods:“The Druids were priests and physicians, curing by magnetism… Their universalremedies were mistletoe and serpent’s eggs, because these substances attractastral light in a special manner. The solemnity with which mistletoe was cutdown drew upon this plant the popular confidence and rendered it powerfullymagnetic.”46 [../Text/index_split_015.html#filepos310337]The Druids, like the other mystery religions, were carriers of advancedknowledge which has been kept from the people, and some of them used it for lessthan positive reasons. I am not condemning the Druids as a whole and I certainlydo not wish to cast a negative interpretation on the work of modern Druids.Knowledge is neutral and the same knowledge can be used with good or malevolentintent. But there is no doubt that the Druidic religion was infiltrated andbegan to manifest the classic rituals and behaviour of the reptilians, includinghuman sacrifice. The Brotherhood today still uses Druidic rituals in its ownblack magic ceremonies.Going home?The evidence of the connections between the Middle-Near East and the BritishIsles and Ireland is simply enormous. You can follow the flow of peoples,knowledge, culture, language, deities, symbols and rituals, very comfortably. Iwonder, however, if this was all travelling between these two areas of the worldfor the first time from around 3,000 BC or whether, in the ancient past beforethe Venus cataclysm, it had all gone in the reverse direction. Could it be thatthe origins of the Middle-Near East cultures had actually been in what becamethe British Isles and Europe, and after 3,000 BC it was taken in the reversedirection. I can’t present detailed evidence of this at the moment, but myresearch is moving that way. If the British Isles and parts of Europe were badlyaffected by Earth upheavals, maybe there was a mass movement of the advancedrace from many parts of the world to safer lands, particularly in the Near East.Certainly, the Babylonian Brotherhood and others with advanced knowledge werevery keen to make their way to Britain and establish their headquarters there.London became the epicentre of their operations and it remains so to this day.There must be a very important reason for that and I think it relates to theenergy fields in these lands. The British Isles is a really sacred place to theBrotherhood because it is the centre of the Earth’s energy grid. It is notwithout reason that there is a greater concentration of stone circles, standingstones, ancient mounds and sites, in areas of Britain than in almost anywhereelse in the world. Those who understand how to manipulate energy andconsciousness would seek to base their activities at the heart centre of theplanetary energy grid and they have done this by operating so much of theirAgenda from the British Isles.London is also a major site on the Earth’s magnetic grid and it became thecapital not only of Britain or Barat-land, but also of the BabylonianBrotherhood. To them, it is their ‘New Troy’ or ‘New Babylon’. The city of Troyin Asia Minor, the place made famous by the Trojan Wars and the Wooden Horselegend, was another Aryan centre. It was the old capital of the Hittites. Manyof the reptile-Aryan bloodlines appear to have been based in Troy and it remainsa sacred place for those at the upper levels of the secret society network whoare aware of their true origins. Troy or Troia means ‘three places’ in Greek andHebrew, an allusion to the trinity, another belief that Christianity has stolenfrom the ancient world. In English, Troy or Troia is Tripoli, the name of thecapital of Libya today and home to that Brotherhood frontman, Colonel Gaddafi.Once again, Troy relates to the extraterrestrial full-bloods and crossbreeds,hence the constant obsession with that name by the Brotherhood. In the Iliadepic, believed to have been written by the Greek poet, Homer, it states thatTroy was founded by Dardanus, the son of the Greek god Zeus, who was a Titan –the reptilian bloodline. Zeus was depicted as both an eagle and a serpent. Hewas said to have been born in Arcadia, in Sparta, and after the Trojan War manySpartans migrated into what is now France. Terms like ‘New Troy’, therefore,relate to centres for these same bloodlines. The Greeks also employed the dragonin their stories of the conflicts between the Titans and the gods of Olympus aswell as in the tales involving Cadmus, the founder of the city of Thebes. Thedragon guarded the Golden Fleece and the dragon protected the fruits of one ofthe twelve labors of Heracles.Most people don’t realise that London was founded as the ‘New Troy’. After thedestruction of Troy around 1,200 BC, the story goes that Aeneas, born of a royalbloodline, fled with the remnants of his people and settled in Italy. There hemarried the daughter of Latinus, the king of the Latins, and through this linelater emerged the Roman Empire. According to many traditions, the grandson ofAeneas, a man called Brutus, landed in Britain around 1,103 BC with a group ofTrojans, including some from colonies in Spain. They referred to Britain as the‘Great White Island’ after the white cliffs which abound on the South Coast. Inthe south west of England is the town of Totnes in Devon, a short distanceinland from Torbay, the oldest seaport in the area. Here there is a stone calledthe Brutus Stone on which, the legend says, the former Trojan prince stood afterhe first landed. Welsh records say that Brutus was met by three tribes ofBritons who proclaimed him king. Brutus founded a city he called ‘Caer Troia’ –New Troy. The Romans would later call it Londinium. London became theoperational centre of the empire of the Babylonian Brotherhood, and it still is,along with Paris and the Vatican. In the King Arthur stories, London or NewTroy, is Troynavant, King Arthur’s eastern gateway city and King Arthur’sCamelot apparently means Martian City or City of Mars. Artefacts discovered bythe German archaeologist, Heinrich Schliemann, at the site of ancient Troy,contained many of the markings found on British megalithic stones. They werealso decorated with the swastika, the Phoenician-Aryan symbol of the Sun. Onceagain, they were the same people. All the white peoples are and it is the whiterace which has taken over the world, quite demonstrably. Just look around you atwho controls all the reigns of global power. White people.And within this race and others, going back to antiquity, are the reptilebloodlines who always seemed to end up in the positions of royal, political,financial and administrative power. They are today centred on London, New Troy,or more appropriately New Babylon. The bodies of these Elite bloodlines areoccupied or controlled by the reptiles of the lower fourth dimension and most ofthe lesser Aryan hierarchy have no idea that this is so. I will focus on thisreptilian-Anunnaki network and chart it into the modern world when we haveconsidered the truth about the religions which the reptilians have used soeffectively to batter the human race into mental, emotional and spiritualsubmission."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos216919] Brian Desborough, The GreatPyramid Mystery.2 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos217083] Ibid.3 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos217662] Ibid.4 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos217963] Ibid.5 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos218362] Ibid.6 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos218706] Geoffrey Higgins, Anacalypsis(first published 1836, republished in 1972 by Health Research, PO Box 850,Pomeroy, WA, USA 99347), volume I, p 368.7 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos220358] The Great Pyramid Mystery.8 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos221031] Ibid.9 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos223023] Ibid.10 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos225450] Ibid.11 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos225681] Ibid.12 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos226077] Ibid.13 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos227190] Ibid.14 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos228206] Ibid.15 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos229022] Ibid.16 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos230004] First Book of Enoch, 7:2-6.17 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos232952] The Universe (Life NationalPicture Library, Time-Life International, Netherlands, 1964), pp 85-94.18 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos233190] Ibid.19 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos233674] Ibid.20 [../Text/index_split_014.html#filepos234277] Adrian G.

Still today inAmerica religion controls the minds and limits the thinking of the Christianpatriot movement which has seen through many other smokescreens and identifiedmany aspects of the Brotherhood conspiracy. What they cannot face, however, isthat their own religion is a massive part of that conspiracy.That is not to condemn all people who call themselves Christian. There are manywho express a loving spirituality through their Christian beliefs. I am talkingof the institution of Christianity and its arrogant indoctrination andimposition of its desperately limited vision of life which has created amind-prison for literally billions of people over almost 2,000 years. All theworld’s major religions, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Islam, came out ofthe very same region of the Middle and Near East from which the Aryan race andthe reptile crossbreeds emerged after the cataclysm of perhaps 7,000 years ago.These religions were designed to imprison the mind and engulf the emotions withfear and guilt. They were usually based on some ‘saviour-god’ figure like Jesusor Mohammed and only by believing in them and following their dictates can wefind ‘God’ and be saved. That is precisely what the Babylonian priests saidabout Nimrod when the blueprint for control-by-religion was being moulded inBabylon. Those who refuse to believe this hogwash are condemned to stoke thefires of hell for all eternity. Staggeringly, billions upon billions have fallenfor this scam over thousands of years, and still do. That’s fine if they want togive their minds and their lives away, but many insist that everyone else mustdo the same and that’s not fine. Seriously not fine. Most of the people readingthis book will be from the parts of the world dominated by Christianity andJudaism and so I shall take those as the main examples of how symbolic storieshave become literal truths and how the manipulation of these stories hasproduced the most powerful form of mass mind control yet invented.To understand the true background to the religions, we need to appreciate thebasis of all ancient religion going back to the Phoenicians, the Babylonians andbeyond. It was the Sun. The hierarchy focused on the Sun because, as I outlinedearlier, they understood its true power as an amazing generator ofelectromagnetic energy which is affecting our lives and behaviour every secondof every day. The Sun contains 99% of the mass of this solar system. Just thinkabout that. The Sun is the solar system and when it changes, we change.Understanding these Sun cycles, and the changing nature of the energy itprojects, allows you to anticipate how human beings are most likely to react tovarious events at different times. As with the texts that form the basis of thevarious religions, there are two levels of knowledge in Sun worship. In theancient world, the hierarchy focused on the Sun because they knew its effect ata deep level, while the masses worshipped the Sun because its heat and light hadan obvious and crucial role in ensuring an abundant harvest. In the same way, aninitiate of the esoteric knowledge will read the Bible differently to aChristian or Jewish believer. The initiate will recognise the symbolism, thenumerology and the esoteric codes, while the believer takes the text literally.So the same text acts as a means of passing on esoteric knowledge to theinitiated and creates a prison-religion for the masses who are not initiated.Great scam.[../Images/00027.jpg]Figure 13: The ancient symbol for the annual cycle of the Sun from which so manysymbols and symbolic stories have originated. You can see this symbol in thedepictions of Barati and Britannia in Figure 12.To understand the ancient Sun symbolism is to understand the major religions. Inthe ancient world they used one particular symbol (see Figure 13) for the Sun’sjourney through the year. As we will see in a later chapter, this is still afundamental symbol used by the Babylonian Brotherhood. It symbolised both thePhoenician depictions of Barati and was on the shield of her British expression,Britannia. The ancients took the circle of the zodiac (a Greek word meaninganimal circle) and inserted a cross to mark the four seasons. At the centre ofthe cross, they placed the Sun. So many of the pre-Christian deities were saidto have been born on December 25th because of this symbolism. On December21st–22nd, you have the winter solstice when, in the northern hemisphere, theSun is at the lowest point of its power in the annual cycle. The Sun, theancients said, had symbolically ‘died’. By December 25th, the Sun haddemonstrably begun its symbolic journey back to the summer and the peak of itspower. The ancients, therefore, said that the Sun was ‘born’ on December 25th.The Christian Christmas is merely a renamed Pagan festival, as indeed are allChristian festivals. Easter is another. About March 25th, the old fixed date forEaster, the Sun enters the astrological sign of Aries the ram or the lamb. Atthis time the ancients used to sacrifice lambs because they believed this wouldappease the gods, most notably the Sun god, and ensure abundant harvests. Inother words they believed that the blood of the lamb would mean that their sinswould be forgiven.In ancient Babylon, Ninus/Tammuz, the son of Queen Semiramis, was said to havebeen crucified with a lamb at his feet and placed in a cave. When a rock wasrolled away from the cave’s entrance three days later, his body had disappeared.I’ve definitely heard that somewhere before. The ancients also symbolised theSun as a baby in December, a youth at Easter, a strapping, immensely strong, manin the summer, an ageing man losing his power in the autumn, and an old man bythe winter solstice. The modern depiction of Old Father Time is a version ofthis. They also symbolised the Sun as having long golden hair (sun rays) whichgot shorter as he lost his power in the months of autumn. Now look again at theOld Testament story of Samson – Sam-sun. He was incredibly strong and had longhair, but he lost his power when his hair was cut. The problems started when heentered the House of Delilah – the astrological house of Virgo, the virgin,through which the Sun passes as autumn approaches. Summoning his last burst ofpower, Sam-the-Sun, pushes down the two pillars, which are classic Brotherhoodsymbolism going back at least to ancient Egypt and are still used by theFreemasons today. Samson is Sam Sun – a symbolic story of the Sun’s annualcycle. There wasn’t any such person. In Hebrew, Samson means I understand, theGod of the Sun.To the orthodox Christian, Jesus is the only begotten Son of God who died so oursins could be forgiven. But you will find exactly the same claims for a streamof ‘gods’ in the ancient world long before the name of ‘Jesus’ was even heardof. Indeed, we know his name wasn’t Jesus because that’s a Greek translation ofa Hebrew name. The term Son of God would seem to originate at least as far backas the Aryan Gothic kings of Cilicia who took the title ‘Son of the Sun God’, atradition adopted by the Pharaohs of Egypt.1[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos393890] To many in the New Age, Jesus isSananda, a high initiate of some spiritual hierarchy who incarnated to infusethe Earth with the ‘Christ’ energy. Or, depending on who you talk to, he was anextraterrestrial on a similar mission. To others he was claiming to be the Kingof the ‘Jews’ by right of his King David bloodline. But did Jesus actuallyexist? Did Moses, Solomon and King David exist? I would say categorically no.There is no credible evidence for the existence of any of them outside thebiblical texts and they are certainly not credible. So where did they come from?The Old TestamentIn 721 BC, it appears that Israel was overrun by the Assyrians and theIsraelites or Canaanites were taken into captivity. However, the tribes known byofficial history as Judah and Benjamin, survived for more than a hundred yearsafter that, before they were conquered and captured by our friends, theBabylonians, in around 586 BC. It was in Babylon, that ancient capital city ofthe reptile-Aryan priesthood and hierarchy, that the Hebrew priests, theLevites, began to create a manufactured history which obscured the truth of whatreally happened. I mean, ask yourself, is a Brotherhood who arranged for thedestruction of ancient knowledge and libraries all over the world going to writedown the true history in their texts or are they going to produce the versionthey want the people to believe? During and after their stay in Babylon, withits wealth of inherited knowledge and stories from Sumer, the Levites mixedtruth, often symbolic truth, with fantasies and this concoction became thefoundations of the Old Testament. The so-called Israelites did not write thesetexts or agree with what they said. Even if you accept they even existed, theIsraelites had long dispersed by the time the Levites inked their pens. Genesis,Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, which together make up the ‘Jewish’ Torah, wereall written by the Levites or under their supervision during or after theirperiod in Babylon. This bunch of human sacrificing, blood drinking fanatics andblack magicians, who you would not trust to tell you the time, compiled the lawwhich Jewish people to this day are supposed to follow. Likewise many Christianfanatics quote this stuff as the word of God! It is not the word of God, it isthe word of the Levites under the direction of the reptile full-bloods andcrossbreeds of the Babylonian Brotherhood. The Sumerian Tablets prove beyondquestion that Genesis was a much edited and condensed version of Sumer records.The Sumerian story of Edin became the Levite’s biblical Garden of Eden. Rememberthe story of ‘Moses’ being found in the bulrushes by the Egyptian princess? Thesame tale was told by the Sumerians-Babylonians about King Sargon the Elder. Thestory of Moses is make-believe, as is the Egyptian ‘captivity’, the Exodus, atleast in the form described, and also the creation of the 12 tribes via Jacob.These texts were written by the Levites, the heads of which were reptilianmystery school initiates in Babylon. Their stories are symbolic and coded forinitiates to understand and the masses to take literally. According to theLevites, Moses was given his laws and commandments by God on top of a mountain.Again and again we see the symbol of mountains. One reason for this is that thetop of a mountain is closer to their symbol of God – the Sun. Mount Sion meansSun Mountain. The Sun rising over the eastern mountains is still a majorBrotherhood symbol today. The Egyptians symbolised the sun rising in the east asHorus, their ‘Son of God’. Hence we have the term hori-zon. When the sun wasgoing ‘down into the dark place’ at dusk, it was symbolised as Set, the Egyptiansymbol for the dark force. Hence sun-set. The story of the Israelites and Jewsis largely a fantasy – the veil behind which the truth has been hidden. No-onehas been ‘had’ more comprehensively over these thousands of years than thepeople who have considered themselves Jewish. They have been terrorised, usedand manipulated in the most merciless and grotesque fashion by their hierarchyto advance an Agenda which the Jewish people in general have not even begun toidentify. There is no greater example of this manipulation than the way thereptilian bloodlines like the ‘Jewish’ Rothschilds funded and supported theNazis and allowed the rank and file Jewish people to reap the unspeakableconsequences. The Levite story of Exodus is a smokescreen to hide the fact thatthe ‘Hebrew’ knowledge was stolen from the Egyptian mystery schools after theywere infiltrated by the Babylonian Brotherhood. The Egyptians considered the‘Jehovah’ revelation to be a robbery committed against the sacred sciences.2[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394014] Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonichistorian and initiate, said that black magic dictated the state religion inEgypt and that the intellectual and spiritual activities of the people wereparalysed by complete obedience to the dogma formulated by the priestcraft. Whata perfect description of the Levite-Babylonian mode of manipulation and of allthe religions, like Christianity, which were to emerge from the lies theypeddled. And that’s a crucial point to remember. Judaism, Christianity and Islamall base their beliefs on these same stories written by the Levites after theirstay in Babylon. We are looking at a point in history which was to define andcontrol the world from then until now. The knowledge the Levites stole fromEgypt and expanded as a result of their stay in Babylon, became known as theCabala (Kabala, Qaballa), which comes from the Hebrew root, QBL, meaning mouthto ear. This is the method used to communicate the most secret information toinitiates. The Cabala is the esoteric stream of what is called Judaism, which infact is a front for the Babylonian Brotherhood, as is the Vatican. The Cabala isthe secret knowledge hidden in codes within the Old Testament and other texts.Judaism is the literal interpretation of it. This is a technique you can see inall the religions. An example of the Levite coding is the names of the fivescribes, Garia, Dabria, Tzelemia, Echanu and Azrel, in the second book of Esdrasor Ezra. The names and their true meanings are: * Garia: Marks which ancient scribes used to indicate that the text is either defective or has another meaning. * Dabria: Words comprising a phrase or text. * Tzelemia: Figures, something figured, or indicated in an obscure manner. * Echanu: Something which has been changed or doubled. * Azrel: The name of Esdras/Ezra, the suffix ‘el’ meaning the work of Ezra.3 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394243]These five names for ‘scribes’ therefore read as one phrase to an initiate:“Marks of warning – of the words – figured in an obscure manner – which havebeen changed or doubled – which is the work of Ezra.”4[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394374] There is a book called The BibleCode5 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394462] which claims to haveidentified a code in the Hebrew version of the Old Testament which predicts thefuture. As one of these codes predicted that Lee Harvey Oswald would killPresident Kennedy, you’ll excuse me if I remain extremely unconvinced about itscredibility. Is there anyone left who still believes that Oswald killed Kennedy?But while I question claims in The Bible Code, there is a code in the Bible, anesoteric code for initiates. They either made up characters to fit theirsymbolism or vaguely based them on living people who they usually massivelymisrepresented. Here are some examples of codes in the Bible. A common theme inall mystery school traditions is of 12 disciples, knights or followerssurrounding a deity. The number 12 is a code, among other things, for the 12months of the year and the houses of the zodiac through which symbolicallytravels the Sun, the ‘god’, symbolised as 13. This is the ‘sacred 12 and one’ assome people describe it and it is one major reason why the numbers 12 and 13keep recurring. Thus you have the 12 tribes of Israel, 12 princes of Ishmael, 12disciples or followers of Jesus, Buddha, Osiris and Quetzalcoatl. There is alsoKing Arthur and his 12 Knights of the Round Table (the zodiac circle), Himmlerand his 12 knights in the Nazi SS, and the woman (Isis, Semiramis) with a crownof 12 stars in the Book of Revelation. In Scandinavia and that whole northernregion you find the Odin mysteries, again inspired by the same Aryan race fromthe Near East. In this tradition, you find twelve ‘Drottars’ presiding over themysteries with Odin. The sacred 12 and one again. These stories are notliterally true, they are mystery school symbolism. This continues today withthese same symbols used by the Brotherhood secret society network in nationalflags, coats of arms, advertising and company logos. That Brotherhood creation,the European Union, has a circle of 12 stars as its symbol. We are talkingsacred numbers and geometry here. The proportions of Egyptian statues, whetherbig or small, were multiples or sub multiples of 12 or 6.The numbers 7 and 40 are also code numbers in the Bible and the mysteries. So inthe Bible we have seven spirits of God, the seven churches of Asia, seven goldencandlesticks, seven stars, seven lamps of fire, seven seals, seven trumpets,seven angels, seven thunders and the red dragon in Revelation with seven headsand seven crowns. The story of Jericho has Joshua marching his army around thecity for seven days, accompanied by seven priests carrying seven trumpets. Onthe seventh day they circled Jericho seven times and the walls came tumblingdown. In the story of Noah, seven pairs of each animal go into the ark and sevenpairs of each type of bird. There are seven days between the prediction of thedeluge and the rain and seven days between the sending of the doves. The arkcomes to rest on the 17th day of the seventh month, Noah leaves the ark on the27th day, and after the flood he begins his seventh century. Many of the namesfor the symbolic deities, such as Abraxas of the Gnostics and Serapis of Greecehave seven letters. Then there is 40. Adam enters Paradise when he is 40 yearsold; Eve follows 40 years later; during the Great Flood it rains for 40 days and40 nights; Seth is carried away by angels when he is 40 and is not seen for 40days; Moses is 40 when he goes to Midian and he stays for 40 years; Joseph is 40years old when Jacob arrives in Egypt; Jesus goes into the wilderness for 40days. The Bible is the word of God? No. It is written in the esoteric code ofthe mystery schools. The Arabian literature was also compiled by and forinitiates of the mysteries and here you find the same codes. The Arbaindt (theforties) are stories which all relate to the number 40 and their calendar has 40rainy and 40 windy days. Their laws constantly refer to 40. Another series ofArabian books, the Sebaydt or ‘seven’ are based on that number. These numbercodes have even deeper meanings than the more obvious ones of days, months andthe zodiac. Numbers also represent vibrational frequencies. Every frequencyresonates to a certain number, colour and sound. Some frequencies, representedby numbers, colours and sounds, are particularly powerful. Symbols alsorepresent frequencies and they affect the subconscious without the personrealising it is happening. This is another reason why certain symbols are seenin secret societies, national flags, company logos, advertising and so on.There is no historical evidence for the existence of a man called Moses exceptin the texts produced by the Levites and other writings and opinions stimulatedby those texts. Some say this was a cover name for the Egyptian pharaoh,Arkenaten, and I would certainly not dismiss that, but the official backgroundto ‘Moses’ and his name have no historical basis. Nothing was known about the‘Moses’ story, or the ‘plagues’ inflicted upon the Egyptians, until the Levitesof Babylon wrote Exodus centuries after it was supposed to have happened. Allthe animals of Egypt were killed three times according to the story! What didthey do, die and immediately remanifest? There was no murder of the first bornof Egypt and so the Feast of the Passover has no historical basis. It wascreated as a result of a story invented by the Levites. Their references to thelamb’s blood on the doors is code for the ancient symbolism of the lamb. Thereis no official book in Hebrew which makes any mention of the Pentateuch (thelaws of Moses) before the Levites went to Babylon. As for the Israelites beingcaptive in Egypt, even Deuteronomy describes them as ‘strangers’, not slaves, inthis period.6 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394619] So where did the nameMoses come from? Every initiated person who attained the highest rank in theEgyptian mystery schools was called a Muse, Mose or… Moses.7[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394747] Manetho, the Egyptian historian ofthe third century BC, quoted by the ‘Jewish’ historian, Josephus, says that hewas a priest at Heliopolis or ON (Place of the Sun), and that afterwards he tookthe name of Mosheh or Moses.8 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394835] Theword Moses means: he who has been taken away, he who has been put out from thewaters, who has been made a missionary, an ambassador, an apostle.9[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos394929] The Chief Priest in the Egyptiantemples was called EOVE or EOVA, hence the emergence of the name Jehovah,10[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395017] and the Hebrew language is reallythe sacred language of the Egyptian mystery schools.11[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395107] The general language of Egypt wascalled CBT, QBT or CBT, and is better known as Copt or Coptic. The sacredlanguage of the mystery schools took its name from OBR or ABR which, in thesetimes, meant the passage from one place to another and a transition of somekind. Exactly the point of the original mystery school teachings, a transitionto greater enlightenment. ABR became Ambres, the name of the holy doctrinereserved for initiates, and it was also written as Ambric, Hebric, Hebraic and…Hebrew.12 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395197] The Hebrew alphabet has22 letters, but the original, before the time of ‘Moses’, only contained ten,and its true meaning was known only to the priests.Hebrews were not Israelites or Jews, they were initiates of the Egyptian mysteryschools, or at least their founders were. No wonder it has proved impossible toidentify a genetic Hebrew or Jewish ‘race’. Cohen, the Jewish name for priest,comes from Cahen, the Egyptian pronunciation for a priest and a prince.13[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395281] Even circumcision, that uniquely‘Jewish’ tradition, came from the Egyptian mystery schools and was performed atleast as far back as 4,000 BC. You could not be initiated unless you werecircumcised. The Hebrew religion did not exist in Egypt and there was no Hebrewlaw because there was no Hebrew ‘race’. The only worship was Egyptian worship.The Hebrew religion, language and race only emerged when initiates of theEgyptian mysteries, later to be known as Levites, took the knowledge out ofEgypt and invented a whole history to cover what they were doing, who they wereworking for and where they came from. The terms ‘Hebrew’ and ‘Judaism’ areanother way of saying Egyptian. This is one reason why we have the constant useof symbols by today’s Brotherhood which relate to Egypt, including the pyramidwith the capstone missing. This is symbolic of the Great Pyramid at Giza and theEgyptian mystery schools, together with much deeper meanings. At the entrance tothe mystery school temple in Egypt were two massive obelisks. These are oftenrepresented as two pillars by the Freemasons and in buildings designed andfunded by initiates. Hence the two pillars that Samson pushed over. Everyinitiate in the mystery schools was given a secret name and this also continueswith the Brotherhood today. One connection to the Hebrews in Egypt could be theinvasion of the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings. The Egyptian historian, Manetho,reported that a strange and barbaric race invaded and took control of Egypt.When they were eventually driven out, he said, they journeyed through Syria andbuilt a city called Jerusalem.14 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395371]The Hyksos could well be a group of similar description called the Habiru whocame out of the former lands of Sumer, as did, according to the Old Testament,the one called Abraham.King Solomon and his temple are more symbolism. There is, again, no independentevidence for a person called King Solomon. Not once has his name appeared in anyinscriptions. Before the Levites wrote their texts, the Greek historianHerodotus (c. 485–425 BC), travelled and researched the lands and history ofEgypt and the Near East. He heard nothing of the empire of Solomon, the massexodus of Israelites from Egypt, or the destruction of the pursuing Egyptianarmy in the Red Sea. Nor did Plato in his travels to the same area. Why? Becauseit is all invention. The three syllables in Sol-om-on are all names for the Sunin three languages. Manly P. Hall wrote that Solomon and his wives andconcubines were symbolic of the planets, moons, asteroids and other receptivebodies within his house – the solar mansion.15[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395461] Solomon’s Temple is symbolic of thedomain of the Sun. In Talmudic legend, Solomon is presented as a master magicianwho understood the Cabala and cast out demons. This is more symbolism of thesecret knowledge held within the fabricated stories of Hebrew ‘history’. Thebooks of Kings and Chronicles, which recount the building of Solomon’s Temple,were written between 500 and 600 years after the events they are supposed to bedescribing. Hebrew chroniclers of the Temple of Solomon are so over the top,it’s hilarious. It was supposed to occupy 153,600 workmen for seven years andits cost, worked out by Arthur Dynott Thomson, would have been £6,900 million.And Thomson was writing in 1872! What would it be today? Such figures areludicrous and yet further examples of the make-believe behind these tales. Theyare symbolic, not literal. Another point. If Solomon didn’t exist, why should webelieve that his ‘father’, King David, did? I keep reading accounts of his lifeand the only sources quoted are the Old Testament texts written by the Levites!There is no other evidence. It’s a con. So is the idea of the King David-Jesusbloodline being taken to France by ‘Mary Magdalene’ to become the Merovingiansas suggested in many books over recent years. As the scholar and researcher, L.A. Waddell, points out:“There is absolutely no inscriptional evidence whatsoever, nor any ancient Greekor Roman reference, for the existence of Abraham or any of the Jewish patriarchsor prophets of the Old Testament, nor for Moses, Saul, David, Solomon, nor anyof the Jewish kings, with the mere exception of two, or at most three, of thelater kings.”16 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395585]The consequences of all this for the people who have called themselves Jewish,and for humanity in general, have been quite appalling. The Mosaic Law, the lawof ‘Moses’, is the law of the Levites – the law of the reptilian full-bloods andcrossbreeds of the Babylonian Brotherhood. What it is not, is the law or word ofGod. The Torah and Talmud, both compiled overwhelmingly in and after their timein Babylon, are a mental bombardment of highly detailed laws governing everyarea of a person’s life. There’s no way that was given by ‘God’ on the top of amountain. The Levites wrote it and then invented Moses to hide this fact. Other‘laws’ have been constantly added or revised since, to cover all eventualities.The pages of these Levite texts contain a constant and sickening theme ofextreme racism against non-Judeans and the need to ‘utterly destroy’ anyone whodefies them – exactly the way Manly Hall described the methods of the blackmagic priests. They encourage murder and mayhem of every conceivable kind. TheTalmud must be the most racist document on Earth. Here are just a few examplesof the depth of its spiritual sickness:“Just the Jews are humans, the non-Jews are no humans, but cattle” Kerithuth 6b,page 78, Jebhammoth 61“The non-Jews have been created to serve the Jews as slaves” Midrasch Talpioth225“Sexual intercourse with non-Jews is like sexual intercourse with animals”Kethuboth 3b“The non-Jews have to be avoided even more than sick pigs” Orach Chaiim 57, 6a“The birth rate of non-Jews has to be suppressed massively” Zohar 11, 4b“As you replace lost cows and donkeys, so you shall replace non-Jews” Lore Dea377,1But this is not just a grotesque diatribe of racism. Look again. It is the veryattitudes that the Draco reptilians and their underlings have towards humans.Remember this horrific stuff was not written by Judeans or ‘Jews’ as a people.They are victims of these beliefs, not the authors. It was written by theLevites, representatives of the priestly bloodlines of the reptilians and theBabylonian Brotherhood, who have no more allegiance to the Jewish people thandid Adolf Hitler. To blame it on ‘the Jews’ is a nonsense and exactly what theBrotherhood want people to do because it creates enormous opportunities todivide and rule, the very foundation of their control. What horrors thismanipulation has caused for ‘Jew’ and ‘Gentile’ alike. It is the same with theJewish oral law called the Mishnah, completed by the second century AD. IsraelShahak, a survivor of the Belsen Concentration Camp, is one of the comparativelyfew people now known as Jews, who has had the courage to openly challenge andexpose the Talmud. Shahak, in his book Jewish History, Jewish Religion,highlights the stunning level of racism on which the ‘Jewish’ (Levite,Brotherhood) law is founded. He tells how the extreme end of this ‘faith’, asrepresented by the orthodox rabbis today, makes it a religious offence to savethe life of a Gentile, unless there would be unpleasant consequences for Jewsnot doing so. The charging of interest on loans to a fellow Jew is banned, butby Talmudic law they must charge a Gentile as much interest as they possiblycan. It is demanded that Jews must utter a curse every time they pass a Gentilecemetery and that when they pass a Gentile building they must ask God to destroyit. Jews are forbidden to defraud each other, but that law does not apply to thedefrauding of Gentiles. Jewish prayers bless God for not making them Gentilesand others ask that Christians may perish immediately. A religious Jew must notdrink from a bottle of wine if a Gentile has touched it since it was opened. TheJewish writer, Agnon, after being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, saidon Israeli radio: “I am not forgetting that it is forbidden to praise Gentiles,but here there is a special reason for doing so – that is, they awarded theprize to a Jew.”17 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395711] These are thelaws of the belief system called ‘Jewish’ which is constantly complaining about,and condemning, racism against Jews! The very belief system is founded on themost extreme racism you will ever encounter. Yet the cry of “anti-Semitic” isused to discredit researchers who are getting too close to the truth about theglobal conspiracy. Benjamin Freedman, a Jew who knew the top Zionists (Sionists,Sun cultists) of the 1930s and 40s, said that anti-Semitism should be eliminatedfrom the English language. He went on:“Anti-Semitism serves only one purpose today. It is used as a smear word. Whenso-called Jews feel that anyone opposes their real objectives, they discredittheir victims by applying the word “anti-Semite” or “anti-Semitic” through allthe channels they have at their command and under their control.”18[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos395936]One of these channels is an organisation based in the United States, andoperating worldwide, which was set up precisely to condemn as racists thoseexposing the Brotherhood. It is called the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Ihave been a target for them myself, something I find very comforting andconfirmation that I am going in the correct direction. It has great support fromnon-Jewish sycophants who wish to keep the ADL sweet and to feed their owndesire to posture their sense of self-purity. I’ll take the sanctimonious,holier-than-thou, ‘antiracist’ movements seriously, when they begin to protestagainst all racism and not just that which suits their political correctness.The smell of hypocrisy makes my nostrils ache. This Levite racism is notfollowed by the overwhelming majority of Jewish people and many have rebelledagainst the strict race laws that demand that Jews only interbreed with Jews.Most people who call themselves Jewish are brought up from birth to be thefrightened, indoctrinated puppets of this vicious Levite hierarchy which hasmetamorphosed as the Pharisees, the Talmudists and the extreme Zionists oftoday, controlled by the fanatical rabbis dispensing the ‘law’ of the Levites ofBabylon on behalf of the reptilians. Most people who follow the religionsspawned from these sources have no idea of their true origin or agenda. This isthe privileged knowledge of a tiny Elite at the top of the secret societynetwork who set up and manipulate the religions and their advocates. They arenot concerned for their followers, be they Jews, Roman Catholics, Muslims,whatever. Nothing emphasises what a sham all these religions and races reallyare more than the present day peoples we are told are ‘Jewish’. As Jewishwriters and anthropologists have said, there is no such thing as the Jewishrace. Jewishness is a faith, not a race. The whole concept of a ‘Jewish’ peoplewas manufactured as a cover story. Alfred M. Lilenthal, the Jewish writer andresearcher, said:“There is no reputable anthropologist who will not agree that Jewish racialismis as much poppycock as Aryan racialism… Anthropological science divides mankindinto three recognised races: Negro, Mongolian and Oriental, and Caucasian orwhite (although some authorities refer to a fourth race – the australoids)…Members of the Jewish faith are found in all three races and subdivisions.”19[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos396194]The point is, however, that within the Jewish faith and other cultures, is arace, a hidden race operating undercover, which carries the bloodlines of thereptilian full-bloods and crossbreeds. These bloodlines appear, on the surface,to be part of these faiths and cultures when, in fact, they are there toimprison and manipulate. So it is with the Levites. It gets even more farcical,and indicative of what a smokescreen world we live in, when you realise thatmost people who call themselves Jewish today have no genetic connectionwhatsoever to the land they call Israel. Yet it is this very connection that wasused to justify the imposition of a ‘Jewish’ homeland on the Arab peoples ofPalestine! Again, as Jewish writers such as Arthur Koestler have exposed, allexcept a small minority of people who created and populated the State of Israel,originate genetically in southern Russia, not Israel. The hooked nose which isconsidered so ‘Jewish’ is a genetic trait of southern Russia and the Caucasus,not Israel. In 740 AD, a people called the Khazars had a mass conversion toJudaism. Koestler writes:“The Khazars came not from Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan, but fromthe Caucasus. Genetically they are more related to the Hun, Uigar and the Magyarthan the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The story of the Khazar Empire, as itslowly emerges from the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax thathistory has ever perpetrated.”20 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos396363]There are two main sub divisions of those who call themselves Jewish, theSephardim and the Ashkenazim. The Sephardim are the descendants of those wholived in Spain from antiquity until the 15th century when they were expelled.The Ashkenazim are the ancestors of the Khazars. In the 1960s, the Sephardimwere estimated to number some half a million, but the Ashkenazim numbered abouteleven million. These eleven million have absolutely no historical connectionwith Israel whatsoever, but they are the ones who invaded Palestine and createdthe State of Israel with the justification that ‘God’ promised them that land inthe Old Testament. Who wrote the Old Testament? Their priests, the Levites! Andwho wrote the New Testament which created Christianity? People controlled by thesame force which controlled the Levites, the Babylonian Brotherhood.The New TestamentOK, a little quiz. Who am I talking about?He was born to a virgin by immaculate conception through the intervention of aholy spirit. This fulfilled an ancient prophecy. When he was born the rulingtyrant wanted to kill him. His parents had to flee to safety. All male childrenunder the age of two were slain by the ruler as he sought to kill the child.Angels and shepherds were at his birth and he was given gifts of gold,frankincense and myrrh. He was worshipped as the saviour of men and led a moraland humble life. He performed miracles which included healing the sick, givingsight to the blind, casting out devils and raising the dead. He was put to deathon the cross between two thieves. He descended to hell and rose from the dead toascend back to heaven.21 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos396551]Sounds exactly like Jesus doesn’t it? But it’s not. That is how they describedthe Eastern saviour god known as Virishna 1,200 years before Jesus is claimed tohave been born. If you want a saviour god who died so our sins could beforgiven, take your pick from the ancient world because there are a stream ofthem, all originating with the Aryan and reptile-Aryan race that came out of theNear East and the Caucasus Mountains. Here are just some of the ‘Son of God’heroes who play the lead role in stories which mirror those attributed to Jesusand almost all were worshipped long before Jesus was even heard of:Krishna of Hindostan; Buddha Sakia of India; Salivahana of Bermuda; Osiris andHorus of Egypt; Odin of Scandinavia; Crite of Chaldea; Zoroaster of Persia; Baaland Taut of Phoenicia; Indra of Tibet; Bali of Afghanistan; Jao of Nepal;Wittoba of Bilingonese; Tammuz of Syria and Babylon; Attis of Phrygia; Xamolxisof Thrace; Zoar of the Bonzes; Adad of Assyria; Deva Tat and Sammonocadam ofSiam; Alcides of Thebes; Mikado of the Sintoos; Beddru of Japan; Hesus or Eros,and Bremrillahm, of the Druids; Thor, son of Odin, of the Gauls; Cadmus ofGreece; Hil and Feta of Mandaites; Gentaut and Quetzalcoatl of Mexico; UniversalMonarch of the Sibyls; Ischy of Formosa; Divine Teacher of Plato; Holy One ofXaca; Fohi and Tien of China; Adonis, son of virgin Io, of Greece; Ixion andQuirinus of Rome; Prometheus of the Caucasus; and Mohammed or Mahomet, ofArabia.22 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos396843]All but a few of those ‘sons of God’ or ‘prophets’, and the mind-prisonreligions founded in their names, come from the very lands occupied orinfluenced by peoples emerging from the Near East and the Caucasus. The lands ofthe Aryans and reptile-Aryans. Other ‘sons of God’ included Mithra or Mithras,the pre-Christian Roman-Persian god, and in Greece and Asia Minor they hadDionysus and Bacchus. These were sons of God who died so our sins could beforgiven, born of a virgin mother, and their birthdays were on… December 25th!Mithra was crucified, but raised from the dead on March 25th – Easter! Mithraninitiations took place in caves adorned with the signs of Capricorn and Cancer,symbolic of the winter and summer solstices, the high and low points of the Sun.Mithra was often portrayed as a winged lion, a symbol for the Sun still used bythe secret societies today. References to the lion and the ‘grip of the lion’spaw’ in the Master Mason Degree of Freemasonry originate with this same streamof mystery school symbolism. Initiates into the rites of Mithra were calledlions and were marked on their foreheads with the Egyptian cross. The firstdegree initiates had a golden crown placed on their heads, representing theirspiritual self, and this crown, symbolising the rays of the sun, can be found onthe Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour. This is one origin of the crowns ofthe ‘royal’ dynasties and the symbolic ‘crown of thorns’ worn by Jesus, the sun.All these rituals went back thousands of years to Babylon and the stories ofNimrod, Queen Semiramis, and Tammuz, their version of Jesus. Mithra was said tobe the son (Sun) of god who died to save humanity and give them eternal life.One classic symbol of Mithra was as a lion with a snake curled around his body,while he holds the keys to heaven. This is more Nimrod symbolism and the originof the story of St Peter, one of Jesus’ 12 disciples, holding the keys toheaven. Peter was the name of the High Priest in the Babylon mystery school.After an initiate of the Mithran cult had completed the ritual, the members hada meal of bread and wine in which they believed they were eating the flesh ofMithra and drinking his blood. Mithra, like a long list of pre-Christian gods,was said to have been visited by wise men at his birth who brought him gifts ofgold, frankincense and myrrh. The same was said by Plato of his teacher,Socrates, in ancient Greece. Christianity is a Pagan sun religion, the worshipof which is condemned by Christianity! It is also an astrology religion, the‘evil’ of which is condemned by Christianity, not least by the Pope! Beam me upScotty, it’s mad down here. The church hierarchy, of course, know all this. Theyjust don’t want you to know. The mystery cult of Mithra spread from Persia tothe Roman Empire and at one point this doctrine could be found in almost everypart of Europe. The present site of the Vatican in Rome was a sacred place forthe followers of Mithra, and his image and symbols have been found cut intorocks and stone tablets throughout the western provinces of the former Romandomain, including Germany, France and Britain. Christianity and the Roman Churchwere based on the Persian-Roman Sun god called Mithra (Nimrod), who has anearlier equivalent in India called Mitra. Tammuz or Adonis (Lord), who wasrevered in Babylonia and Syria, was said to have been born at midnight onDecember 24th. These were also ‘sons’ of God.Horus was the the ‘son’ of God in Egypt. He provided another blueprint for thelater Jesus. The connections are devastating for the credibility of theChristian Church: Jesus was the Light of the World. Horus was the Light of theWorld. Jesus said he was the way, the truth and the life. Horus said he was thetruth, the life. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the ‘house of bread’. Horus wasborn in Annu, the ‘place of bread’. Jesus was the Good Shepherd. Horus was theGood Shepherd. Seven fishers board a boat with Jesus. Seven people board a boatwith Horus. Jesus was the lamb. Horus was the lamb. Jesus is identified with across. Horus is identified with a cross. Jesus was baptised at 30. Horus wasbaptised at 30. Jesus was the child of a virgin, Mary. Horus was the child of avirgin, Isis. The birth of Jesus was marked by a star. The birth of Horus wasmarked by a star. Jesus was the child teacher in the temple. Horus was the childteacher in the temple. Jesus had 12 disciples. Horus had 12 followers. Jesus wasthe Morning Star. Horus was the Morning Star. Jesus was the Christ. Horus wasthe Krst. Jesus was tempted on a mountain by Satan. Horus was tempted on amountain by Set.23 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos396934]Jesus is said to be the ‘judge of the dead’. He has some competition there. Thiswas also said of the earlier Nimrod, Krishna, Buddha, Ormuzd, Osiris, Aeacus andothers. Jesus is the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. So was Krishna,Buddha, Lao-kiun, Bacchus, Zeus and others. Jesus is claimed to have performedmiracles such as healing the sick and raising people from the dead. So didKrishna, Buddha, Zoroaster, Bochia, Horus, Osiris, Serapis, Marduk, Bacchus,Hermes and others. Jesus was born of royal blood. So was Buddha, Rama, Fo-hi,Horus, Hercules, Bacchus, Perseus and others. Jesus was born to a virgin. So wasKrishna, Buddha, Lao-kiun or tsze, Confusius, Horus, Ra, Zoroaster, Prometheus,Perseus, Apollo, Mercury, Baldur, Quetzalcoatl and far too many others tomention. Jesus will, we are told, be born again. The sky is going to be rathercrowded because Krishna, Vishnu, Buddha, Quetzalcoatl and others, will also bethere. The ‘star’ at the birth of Jesus is another multideity story and goesback at least to the Babylonian tale of Nimrod who, in a dream, saw a brilliantstar rising above the horizon. The soothsayers told him that this foretold thebirth of a child who would become a great prince.24[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397158] It’s all recycling. Jesus is a mythman.[../Images/00028.jpg]Figure 14: A Phoenician standing stone depicting their Sun God, Bel or Bil, withthe halo representing the rays of the Sun. This is precisely the way ‘Jesus’ isportrayed because he, too, was a symbol of the Sun.The invented character of Jesus was a Sun god, symbolic of God’s ‘Sun’… TheLight of the World. This very phrase, Light of the World, was used by theAryan-Phoenicians to symbolise the ‘one true god’ thousands of years before thealleged birth of Abraham, the quite wrongly named creator of the one-godconcept.25 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397479] They also symbolised theone true god, the Sun, with the ‘one true cross’.26[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397613] The Christians portray Jesus with ahalo around his head and that’s exactly how the Phoenicians depicted the rays ofthe Sun around the head of their Sun god, Bel or Bil. This can be seen on aPhoenician stone dating to about the 4th century BC (see Figure 14). The Sun wasat the heart of the Egyptian religion and at noon when the Sun was at the peakof its daily ‘journey’, they prayed to the ‘Most High’. At this time, they saidthe Sun was going about his father’s work in the temple. The Bible tells us thatat the age of 12 (noon) Jesus was doing his father’s work in the temple,worshipping the “most high”. The virgin mothers associated with all of these Sungods were different names for Queen Semiramis and Ninkharsag, also known asIsis, the Egyptian symbol of the female creative force without which nothing,not even the Sun, could exist. Over time, names for what had once symbolisedextraterrestrial ‘gods’ became used to describe concepts and esotericprinciples. Different eras and cultures gave different names to these sameconcepts and so in the Gospels, Horus became Jesus and Isis became Mary, thevirgin mother of Jesus, the Sun. Mary is constantly pictured holding the babyJesus, but this is merely a repeat of all the Egyptian portrayals of Isisholding the baby Horus (see Figure 15). These different people did not actuallyexist, they are symbolic. Isis became associated with the astrological sign ofVirgo the virgin, as did Mary. The titles given to Isis of ‘Star of the Sea’ and‘Queen of Heaven’ were also given to Mary and they both originate from QueenSemiramis, who was called the Queen of Heaven in Babylon. Christianity andJudaism are both the religion of Babylon.[../Images/00029.jpg]Figure 15: Mary and Jesus? No, this is the way the Egyptians portrayed Isis andHorus. If you lived in ancient Babylon this would have been Queen Semiramis andNinus/Tammuz.Throughout the world you see the same Sun religions and rituals, in Sumer,Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Britain, Greece, Europe in general, Mexico and CentralAmerica, Australia… everywhere. It was the universal religion inspired by thesame, ultimately extraterrestrial, source thousands of years beforeChristianity. Sun and fire worship was the focus of religions in India wheretheir festivals charted the Sun’s symbolic cycle through the year,27[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397697] and in the Jesus story you seeconstant symbolic references to this and to astrology and mystery schoolsymbolism. The crown of thorns is the symbol of the rays of the Sun, just likethe crown of spikes around the head of the Statue of Liberty. The cross is alsoSun and astrological symbolism, as you saw earlier with the cross and thecircle. Leonardo da Vinci, the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion (Sun), usedthis same symbolism in his famous painting of the Last Supper (see Figure 16).He divides the 12 disciples into four groups of three with Jesus, the ‘Sun’, inthe middle of them. Again this is astrological symbolism painted by a highinitiate of the secret societies and mystery schools who knew the truth. It maywell be that da Vinci has portrayed one of the disciples as a woman to symbolisethe Isis, Barati, Semiramis, deity. This became symbolised as an ‘M’ for Mary orMadonna (Semiramis). Jesus is said to have been born on December 25th, a datethe Christians took from the Sun religions of Sol Invictus (the Sun Unconquered)for reasons I’ve explained. He is also said to have died at Easter on a cross.This is a repeat of the same ancient story again. The Egyptians representedOsiris stretched out on a cross in astrological symbolism.According to the ancients, it took three days for the Sun to recover from‘death’ on December 21st/22nd. In the Gospels how many days are there betweenJesus ‘dying’ and ‘rising’ from the dead? Three! The same time it took theBabylon Son of God, Ninus/Tammuz, to rise again. This is how Luke’s Gospeldescribes what happened as Jesus (the Sun) died on the cross:“And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the Earthuntil the ninth hour. And the Sun was darkened…” Luke 23-44,45The son/Sun had died and so there was darkness. And look how many hours thislasted for: three. The same story of darkness at their death was told by theHindus of Krishna, the Buddhists of Buddha, the Greeks of Hercules, the Mexicansof Quetzalcoatl, ad infinitum, long before Jesus. When he died, Jesus ‘descendedinto hell’, just like the earlier Krishna, Zoroaster, Osiris, Horus,Adonis/Ninus/Tammuz, Bacchus, Hercules, Mercury and so on. He then rose from thedead like the earlier Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster, Adonis/Ninus/ Tammuz, Osiris,Mithra, Hercules and Baldur. Jesus was symbolically crucified at Easter becausethis is the spring equinox when the Sun (Jesus) enters the astrological sign ofAries, the Ram or… the lamb. The lamb in the Book of Revelation is the samesymbol. In around 2,200 BC the group known as the Priesthood of Melchizedekbegan making their aprons with lamb’s wool, a symbol continued today by a modernexpression of the Brotherhood, the Freemasons. It is at Easter, the equinox,that Jesus (the Sun) triumphs over darkness – the time of year when there ismore light than darkness every day. The world is restored by the power of theSun in the time of rebirth and the spring equinox was one of the most sacredEgyptian events. Queen Isis was often portrayed with rams heads to symbolisethat the time of Aries, the spring, was a period of nature’s abundant creation.The Festival of Easter was as important to early Christians as December 25th.The legend of Mithra said he was crucified and was resurrected on March 25th.The date of Easter is no longer fixed to the first day of Aries, but thesymbolism remains. The Christian religious day is… SUNday. Christian churchesare build east-west with the altar to the east. This means that the congregationface east – the direction of the rising Sun, Horus. Even Easter eggs, like hotcross buns, are not a Christian tradition. Dyed eggs were sacred Easterofferings in Egypt and Persia, among other places. How ironic that theauthorities at Westminster Abbey have questioned whether they should have aChristmas tree because it is a Pagan symbol. The whole flippin’ religion ispagan![../Images/00030.jpg]Figure 16: The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. Look how he symbolises Jesus asthe Sun and breaks up the twelve disciples into four sets of three – the signsof the zodiac. It is a pictorial version of the sun circle and the cross we sawearlier.Along with the Sun symbolism, the Jesus story and its countless predecessorsalso include initiation symbolism from the mystery schools. The cross as areligious symbol can be found in every culture, from the Native Americans to theChinese, India, Japan, Egypt, Sumer, the ancient peoples of Europe andcentral-south America. The Buddhist Wheel of Life is made of two superimposedcrosses and birds with their wings open are used to symbolise the cross inendless logos, coats of arms and badges. One of the most ancient forms of thecross is the Tau or Tav cross which resembles the letter T. This was the crosson which political dissidents were hung by the Romans, apparently. It was thesymbol of the Druid god, Hu, and it is still used today by the Freemasons intheir symbol of the T square. The Egyptian’s Crux Ansata, the ‘cross of life’,added a loop to the top. The Crux Ansata and the Tau cross were found on statuesand other artwork throughout ancient Central America. It was associated withwater and the Babylonians used the cross as an emblem of the water gods who theysaid had brought them their civilisation. The Nagas, by the way, thehuman-reptile gods of the East, were also said to live in the water. The conceptof a saviour god figure dying for humanity is an ancient one. The religions ofIndia had a tradition of the crucified saviour centuries before Christianity andit originated from the Aryans in the Caucasus. The Hindu ‘Christ’ figure,Krishna, appears in some portrayals nailed to a cross in classic Jesus manner.28[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397857] Quetzalcoatl is said to have comeout of the sea carrying a cross and he has been represented as being nailed to across. In mystery school symbolism, a cross of gold = illumination; a cross ofsilver = purification; a cross of base metals = humiliation; and a cross of wood= aspiration. The latter relates to the constant symbolism of the tree andsaviour god figures dying on trees or wooden crosses. Some of the Pagan mysteryceremonies involved the student hanging from a cross or lying on an altar in theshape of a cross.29 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos397988] It symbolisedthe death of the body, the world of physical domination and desire, and openingto the spiritual self. The driving in of nails and the flow of blood is yet moremystery school symbolism. The crucifixion of Jesus was an allegory, a symbolicevent written to carry a hidden meaning. It did not physically happen, you arejust meant to think it did. And what of the physical resurrection from the deadby Jesus? St Paul is quoted as saying of this event in his first letter to theCorinthians:“But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And ifChrist be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of Godthat he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead risenot.” Corinthians 15:13-16He says that if Jesus was not physically raised from the dead, there is no basisto the Christian faith and religion. If that’s the case, Christianity is inserious trouble. First of all the Gospel accounts of the resurrection havenumerous contradictions as each copied the original story differently, orchanged it on purpose. And secondly the resurrection is yet more Sun symbolismfrom the ancient religions. In Persia, long before Christianity, they had aritual in which a young man, apparently dead, was restored to life. He wascalled the Saviour and his sufferings were said to have ensured the salvation ofthe people. His priests watched his tomb until midnight on the equinox and theycried: “Rejoice, O sacred initiated! Your God is risen. His death and sufferingshave worked your salvation.” The same tale was told in Egypt about Horus and inIndia about Krishna a thousand years before Christianity. The Bible tells usthat Jesus will return on a cloud and what do we see among the clouds? The Sun.The tomb of Jesus is symbolic of the darkness into which the Sun descendedbefore its rebirth and nearly all the mystery school initiations involved somesort of cave, underground chamber, or dark enclosed space, like the sweatlodgesof native America. Even the story of the spear which pierced the side of Jesusafter he was taken from the cross is mystery school symbolism. The Christianlegend says that this was done by a blind Roman centurion called Longinus andsome of the blood of Jesus fell on his eyes and cured his blindness. Longinuswas converted and spent the rest of his life breaking up Pagan idols. Yeah, surehe did. Centurions were not blind and could not have done their job if theywere, and once again we find this story is a repeat from earlier versions. TheScandinavian saviour, Balder, son of Odin, had a spear of mistletoe thrust intohim by Hod, a god who was blind. March 15th, the Ides of March, was when manyPagan saviours also died. This day was devoted to Hod and later became aChristian feast day to the ‘Blessed Longinus’!30[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398091] You’ve got to laugh, really.The symbol of the fish is a theme throughout the Gospel stories and this issymbolic of Nimrod/Tammuz, the father-son, of Babylon. Another reason for Jesusas a fish was the astrological sign of Pisces, the fishes. Around the time Jesuswas supposed to have been born, the Earth was entering the astrological house ofPisces. A new age was being born and Jesus the fish could have been a symbol ofthe age of Pisces. We are now entering another new age, the age of Aquarius,according to the laws of the ‘Earth wobble’ precession. When the Bible talks ofthe end of the world, this is another mistranslation. They translate ‘world’from the Greek, ‘aeon’, but aeon does not mean world, it means ‘age’.31[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398283] We are not facing the end of theworld, but the end of the age, the 2,160 years of Pisces. Christianity did notreplace the Pagan religions, it is a Pagan religion. The Persians, who inheritedtheir beliefs from Sumer, Egypt and Babylon, had baptism, confirmation, paradiseand hell, angels of light and darkness, and a fallen angel. All of these wereabsorbed by Christianity and claimed for their own.During the alleged life time of Jesus, the Essene Brotherhood, was based atQumran at the northern end of the Dead Sea, or at least that is what we aretold. Brian Desborough’s research indicates that this site was a leper colony atthe time and that the Essenes lived in a much more appropriate place furtheralong the Dead Sea coast. The Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves near Qumran in1947, have offered a greater insight into their lifestyle and beliefs, despitesuppression by the authorities who wish to maintain the official version ofhistory. The scrolls were hidden from the Romans during the ill-fated Judeanrevolt around 70 AD. Some 500 Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts were found, whichincluded texts from the Old Testament, among them a complete draft of the Bookof Isaiah, centuries older than the one in the Bible. There were scores ofdocuments relating to the Essene customs and organisation. The scrolls confirmthat the Essenes were fanatics who followed to the letter the Levite inventionsin the Old Testament texts. Anyone who didn’t do the same was their enemy andthey fiercely opposed the Roman occupation. They were a Palestine branch of aneven more extreme Egyptian sect called the Therapeutae (‘healers’, hencetherapeutic 32 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398439]) and they inheritedthe secret knowledge of Egypt and the ancient world. The Therapeutae and theEssenes also used the symbol of the ‘messeh’, the ‘Draco’ crocodile of Egypt,the fat of which anointed the Pharaohs under the authority of the Royal Court ofthe Dragon. The Essenes had a detailed understanding of drugs, including thehallucinogenic variety, which were used in mystery school initiations and forentering other states of consciousness. The properties of the ‘sacred mushrooms’or ‘Holy Plant’ were so much part of life in the secret brotherhood that theJewish high priest wore a mushroom cap (see Figure 17) to acknowledge theirimportance. They had special rituals for their preparation and use. Themushroom, too, was given ‘son of God’ connotations (what wasn’t?) and it wasconnected to the Sun cycle. The mushrooms were picked with great reverencebefore sunrise and many symbols of this ritual can be found in the Bible and farolder texts. Again, the use of the sacred mushroom and other drugs, and thesecret knowledge of their properties, can be traced back to the earliest days ofSumer.33 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398577] The Therapeutae had aflourishing university at Alexandria and from there they sent out missionariesto establish branches and affiliated communities across the Middle East. Hereagain we have the connection back to Egypt and the mystery schools.[../Images/00031.jpg]Figure 17: The Jewish priest with the mushroom cap to symbolise the importanceof magic hallucinogenic mushrooms in their rituals.The Essenes were advocates of Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher and esotericmathematician, who was a high initiate of both the Greek and Egyptian mysteryschools.34 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398737] According to the mostfamous historian of the period, Josephus, the Essenes were sworn to keep secretthe names of the powers who ruled the universe. This was in line with the lawsof the mystery schools. The Essenes-Therapeutae practised rituals very similarto the later Christian baptism and they marked the foreheads of initiates with across. This being the symbol indicated in the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel forenlightened (or illuminated) ones and also used for initiations into themysteries of Mithra and other such Sun god figures. The Essenes viewed naturalbodily functions, including sex, with disgust and in that sense they were anexcellent forerunner of the Roman Church which was to absorb many of theirbeliefs, terms and practises. Two of the Dead Sea Scrolls, one in Hebrew, theother in Aramaic, contain what we would call horoscopes, the belief that themovement of the planets affects a person’s character and destiny. The Essenespractised astrology, the symbolism of which you find throughout the Gospels andthe Old Testament. The early Christians, an offshoot of the Essenes-Therapeutae,did the same, as did the Romans and all the Gentile nations surrounding Judea.35[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos398909] The writer, Philo, who lived at thealleged time of Jesus, said in his Treatise on the Contemplative Life, that whenthe Therapeutae prayed to God, they turned to the Sun and they studied in orderto discover the hidden (coded) meaning of sacred books. He wrote that they alsomeditated on the secrets of nature contained in the books under the veil ofallegory.36 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399133] That is precisely theway the Bible is written. Today this secret language is used in the logos, coatsof arms and flags, of companies, countries and other Brotherhood-controlledorganisations.Interconnected with the Essenes and a theme which links both the Old and NewTestaments is the secret society called the Nazarites or Nazarenes. OldTestament characters such as Moses and Samson were said to be members of thisgroup and so were Jesus, his brother James, John the Baptist and St Paul. TheActs of the Apostles says of St Paul: “For we have found this man a pestilentfellow, and a mover of sedition among all of the Jews throughout the world, anda ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.”37[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399263] None of these people reallyexisted, but the Nazarene symbolism makes a secret society link through theBible. The Essenes and the Nazarites-Nazarenes appear to be different offshootsof the same group. The Essenes wore white according to the ‘Judean’ historianJosephus, but the Nazarenes wore black, the same as the priests of Isis inEgypt. Black is a colour of the Babylonian Brotherhood which has manipulated itsway through history. In keeping with this, black has become the colourassociated with authority (look at the legal profession) and with death. It isalso the traditional colour of the teaching profession with the black gown andthe black hat called the mortar board, which is the circle and square symbol ofFreemasonry. The greatest miracle of Jesus, it seems, was coming from Nazarethbecause Nazareth did not exist at the time. And Jesus said: “Let there beNazareth. And there was Nazareth.” Or rather, there wasn’t. The name does notappear in any of the detailed Roman records, nor in any books, writings ordocuments of any kind relating to the period covered by the Gospels. Jesus the‘Nazarene’ does not relate to Nazareth, but to the Nazarene secret society.The Essenes-Therapeutae-Nazarenes were the bridge between the Old Testament, theNew Testament and the creation of Christianity. The early ‘Christians’ werecalled Nazarenes before they were called Christians.38[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399351] The rituals of the NazareneBrotherhood can be clearly seen in the Christian Church today. The Nazareneswore black and so do most Christian clerics. At Qumran they had a ritual bath towash away their ‘sins’. This became the Christian baptism. They had a meal ofbread and wine which became the Christian Mass. W. Wynn Westcott was a founderof the Satanic Order of the Golden Dawn in England which would later play asignificant role in the emergence of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. He knew theinside story and he said in his work, The Magical Mason, that today’s Freemasonsgo back to the Essenes among other ancient groups of similar background. Todaythe Arabic word for Christians is Nasrani and the Muslim Koran uses the termNasara or Nazara. These originate with the Hebrew word, Nozrim, which derivedfrom the term, Nozrei ha-Brit – the Keepers of the Covenant. The term, Nozreiha-Brit, can be traced as far back as the alleged time of Samuel and Samson inthe Old Testament. Samuel was portrayed as the top man of the Levites and it wasthey who orchestrated this whole Bible-Talmud scam under the direction of theBabylonian Brotherhood. The Covenant is the Freemason’s Great Work of Ages – theAgenda for the takeover of the planet by the reptilians.The bloodlines, the ‘chosen people’ of the gods, and the secret knowledge, aresymbolised as ‘the vine’ and ‘vineyards’ in the Bible and countless otherwritings and pictures. The Old Testament speaks of “The vine thou didst bringout of Egypt”.39 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399539] We are also toldthat “The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel and the men ofJudah his pleasant plant”.40 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399630] Thebloodline symbolised as the vine is not, I would strongly suggest, the bloodlineof King David at all. He didn’t exist for a start, which confirms the pointrather conclusively. The symbolism of the vine can once again be traced back toBabylon and Egypt. In the mystery schools of Greece, their Sun gods Dionysus andBacchus, were the patron gods of the vineyard.41[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399720] What do grapes depend upon to grow?The Sun. The vine and the bloodline of ‘Jesus’ weaved in among that Sunsymbolism is one of the royal and priestly bloodlines which lead back to thereptilians, the Anunnaki. The New Testament features the Wedding at Cana, butthis was not a real wedding. It is again symbolic of the Sun and the Earth, thegod and goddess. In the land of Canaan every spring, they celebrated sexual andfertility rites under the title, ‘The Marriage Festival of Canaan’.42[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399834] It was at the symbolic wedding atCana in the Gospels that Jesus turns the water into wine. It is the Sun’s warmthand the Earth’s water which grow the grapes to make wine. Bacchus, the Greek sonof Zeus and the virgin Semele, was said to have turned water into wine. Alsothere were Essene ritual terms related to water and wine. The Essenes,Therapeutae and Gnostics were seriously into hidden meanings and the Jesusstories are a mass of interweaved allegories related to the Sun, astronomy,astrology, bloodlines, secret knowledge and the rituals and names used by themystery schools. The New Testament is a mirror of the Old in that some fact,much fiction, and a mass of esoteric codes and symbols are fused, and oftencon-fused, into a narrative which is desperately misleading if taken literally.This is summed up by the phrase: “Let he who has ears, let him hear”. Let he whois initiated into the secret knowledge understand what I am really saying. Lethe who is not initiated believe any old crap.Here are a few more Bible myths to explode: * The idea of the ‘carpenter’ is a translation error. The English translation of ‘carpenter’ comes from the Hebrew word naggar, via the Greek, ho tekton. These words do not mean literally a ‘carpenter’, but people who were masters of their craft and the word was applied to teachers and scholars as well as craftsmen. * Jesus was definitely not born in a stable and not a single gospel claims this is so. The Christmas nativity is complete invention. The concept comes from Luke’s Gospel43 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos399990] which says that Jesus was laid in a manger, an animal feeding box, because there was no room in the inn. But the Greek version, from which the English translation came, says there was no ‘topos’ in the ‘kataluma’ – there was no place in the room.44 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400078] Matthew’s Gospel specifically states that Jesus was in a house: “And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshipped him.”45 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400198] Mangers were often used for babies when a proper cradle was not available, but they moved the manger to the baby, not the baby to the manger! * The nativity scene apparently originates with St Francis of Assisi in Greccio, Italy, in 1223 AD.46 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400292] He brought together some local people and their livestock to illustrate the birth of Jesus and this nativity scene quickly caught on. Manger scenes carved from wood became popular all over Italy at Christmas and the rest is history. Giving gifts is not a Christian custom, either. This was done in the Pagan world at New Year long before Christianity. The Christians simply borrowed it, as they did everything else. * The prophecies said that the ‘messiah’ (messeh, the crocodile of Egypt) would be called Emmanuel, but the name of the Gospel ‘messiah’ was Jesus, or at least its Judean equivalent. Oops! Funny how Christians seem to miss this point when they quote the prophecy about the coming of ‘Emmanuel’ every Christmas. Think of all those children who have been dressed up as Mary, Joseph, shepherds, wise men, donkeys, cows and sheep. This fantasy has been used to indoctrinate countless generations to believe that this is how it all happened, when, in truth, the nativity and the Christmas story are the acting out of translation errors, an invention of St Francis, and the mid-winter rituals of Pagan beliefs. I say, Jenny and Johnny, before you don those costumes this year, can I have a quiet word? * The Christian Eucharist, when they eat bread and drink wine to symbolise the body and blood of Christ, originates with a cannibalistic ritual when they ate and drank the real thing in animal and human sacrifices. Most of the Christian terms come from the Greek, including Christ and Christianity. Among many others are Church (the Lord’s House), Ecclesiastical (Ecclesia, the Greek Assembly or Parliament), Apostle (missionary), Presbyter/priest (elder), and baptism (immersion). * Even according to the Gospel stories, Jesus was surrounded by terrorists. Simon Magus was known as Simon Zelotes (the Zealot) to acknowledge his role as a commander of the Zealots, the ‘freedom fighters’ who advocated a war against the Romans. Another description is Simon ‘Kananites’, a Greek word meaning fanatic. This was translated into English as Simon the Canaanite! Judas ‘Iscariot’ derives from the word Sicarius, which meant assassin. There was a terrorist group called the Sicarii or Sons of the Dagger, and this name comes from the word, Sica, meaning curved dagger. Sicarius became the Greek, Sikariotes, and this was later mistranslated into English as Iscariot. The Zealots-Sicarii would raid Roman supply caravans and ambush their soldiers very much along the lines of terrorist groups like the IRA in Northern Ireland. * * People were not crucified for theft which makes the story of the two thieves crucified with Jesus another invention. It is a ‘steal’ once again because the same story was told about some of the pre-Christian Jesus figures. The punishment for the ‘crimes’ Jesus was accused of in the Gospels would have been stoning to death by the Judean authorities, not the Romans. * Pontius Pilatus, the Roman Procurator in this period, is supposed to have washed his hands and passed on responsibility for the death of ‘Jesus’ to the crowd. The washing of hands to indicate innocence was the custom of the Essene community.47 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400439] The Bible says that it was the Roman custom at the time of the Passover Festival to offer a prisoner for release, but this is simply not true. There was no such custom and the scene is invention.You can write an entire book about the myths in the Bible and, in fact, someonehas. It’s called, appropriately, Bible Myths, and if you want detaileddocumentation of the information in this chapter I thoroughly recommend it.There is no credible evidence whatsoever for the existence of Jesus. Noarchaeological evidence, no written evidence, nothing. So it is with Solomon,Moses, David, Abraham, Samson and countless other biblical ‘stars’. All we haveare the Levite texts and the Gospel stories in their various versions. Sodesperate did the religious manipulators become to cross reference ‘Jesus’ thatthey inserted a pathetically obvious addition into the works of the ‘Jewish’historian, Josephus, to support the unsupportable. More than 40 writers areknown to have chronicled the events of these lands during the alleged time ofJesus, but they don’t mention him.48[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400611] A guy who did all the things thathe was supposed to have done and no-one records it? Philo lived throughout thesupposed life of Jesus and wrote a history of the Judeans which covered thewhole of this period. He even lived in or near Jerusalem when Jesus was said tohave been born and Herod was supposed to have killed the children, yet hedoesn’t record any of this. He was there when Jesus is said to have made histriumphant arrival in Jerusalem and when he was crucified and rose from the deadon the third day. What does Philo say about these fantastic events? Nothing. Nota syllable. Not a titter.49 [../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400770] None ofthis is mentioned in any Roman record or in the contemporary accounts of thewriters of Greece and Alexandria who were familiar with what happened there.50[../Text/index_split_017.html#filepos400854]Why? Because it didn’t happen. It was a symbolic, coded story to pass onesoteric and astrological knowledge of many kinds and, most crucially, to createanother prison-religion based on the symbols of the Babylonian Brotherhood.

If anyone requiresconfirmation of how easy it is for the few to control the masses, they need lookno further than the billions of people who have worshipped the fairy talespeddled these past 2,000 years by men in long frocks. And what goes forChristianity goes for the rest of them, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and all therest.These religions were created by the same force to achieve the same effect and,therefore, the saviour-god myths throughout the ancient world have an identicalgame plan: 1 You are born with original sin and so you are an unworthy piece ofshit from the day you arrive on the planet. 2 You can only be saved by believingin the ‘Saviour’ and that means doing what the priesthood tell you to do. 3 Ifyou don’t do that, you will be condemned to the bowels of hell forever. Whatguilt and terror this has created over thousands of years. I have heard RomanCatholic mothers in anguish after their babies have died wondering what willhave happened to them. The babies couldn’t believe in Jesus because they wereonly a few days old, so would they go to heaven or hell? I was watching a RomanCatholic television channel in the United States and the guy with the long frockwas asked about that. He said it was a profound theological question. Oh really?He said that either the baby’s soul would go into limbo (until when onewonders?) or it would be judged on the behaviour of the parents. What staggeringnonsense. Thank goodness the baby won’t be judged on the behaviour of thepriests. And if you can only be saved by believing in Jesus, what about allthose billions of people throughout the period of Christianity who lived in vastareas of the world who had never heard of Jesus? Are they all condemned by lackof information to stoke the fires, too? Bit of an arsehole, this Christian God,eh? But of course it’s not true. It’s all make-believe, conjured up by theBabylonian Brotherhood initiates of the reptilians to control the minds of themasses.When I was writing this section of the book and investigating where the Gospelscame from, I was reaching to take a book from a high shelf in my office. As Ipulled the book down, another smaller one fell to the floor. I don’t rememberseeing it before, but the title immediately caught my attention. It was The TrueAuthorship Of The New Testament by Abelard Reuchlin, first printed in the UnitedStates in 1979.1 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos468455] It talked about aninner circle or inner ring, the most exclusive club in history, who knew the‘Great Secret’. In this circle were those religious, political and literaryleaders, who knew the truth about Jesus, but did not want anyone else to know.What struck me was that this book came to the same conclusions that I had. TheGospels are an invention designed to manufacture a new prison-religion. The bookdoesn’t go into all the symbolism I have documented here, but it does name thefamily and others who wrote the New Testament and the codes they used to ‘sign’their authorship. One of these codes, interestingly, is the number 40 Ihighlighted earlier. Forty was also represented by the letter M, as in Mary. Theletter M is very significant to the Brotherhood still today and we see iteverywhere in the symbol of the McDonalds fast food chain. We will see later howthe big corporations use Brotherhood symbolism in their logos and names. M meansMary or Madonna, who means Semiramis. The wealth of evidence in Reuchlin’s book,much of it complex and dealing with esoteric mathematical codes, is extremelycompelling. I do recommend you try to get hold of a copy if you want the fulldetails. The opening paragraph encapsulates its findings:“The New Testament, the Church and Christianity, were all the creation of theCalpurnius Piso (pronounced Peso) family, who were Roman aristocrats. The NewTestament and all the characters in it – Jesus, all the Josephs, all the Marys,all the disciples, apostles, Paul, John the Baptist – all are fictional. ThePisos created the story and the characters; they tied the story to a specifictime and place in history; and they connected it with some peripheral actualpeople, such as the Herods, Gamaliel, the Roman procurators, etc. But Jesus andeveryone involved with him were created (that is fictional!) characters.”2[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos468667]The Pisos were a bloodline family descended from statesmen, consuls, poets andhistorians, and such people would definitely be initiates of the secret societynetwork of the Roman Empire, a major stepping stone for the reptilianfull-bloods and crossbreeds to the present day. This is why a Roman soldier isthe logo of that Brotherhood operation, American Express. The Piso familyclaimed to descend from Calpus who, they said, was the son of Numa Pompilius,the successor to Romulus, the founder of Rome. These were seriously connectedpeople. Such Roman bloodlines are said to have come from Troy and we are lookingat a family which goes back to the Caucasus and the Near East. After thedestruction of Troy around 1,200 BC, the story goes that a guy called Aeneas ofa ‘royal’ (that is reptilian) bloodline went with the remnants of his people andsettled in Italy. There he married into the royal family of the Latins andthrough this bloodline later emerged the Roman Empire. According to manytraditions, the grandson of Aeneas, a man called Brutus, landed in Britainaround 1,103 BC with a group of Trojans, including some from colonies in Spain,to become King of the Britons and found the city of New Troy – London.Lucius Calpurnius Piso, the head of the family, was married to the greatgranddaughter of Herod the Great. According to Reuchlin’s research, Piso, whoused many pseudonyms, produced his ‘Ur Marcus’, the first version of the Gospelof Mark, in about 60AD. One of the friends who encouraged him was the famousRoman writer, Annaeus Seneca, but it seems that both of them were killed by theEmperor Nero in the year 65. With this, the name Piso disappears from Romanhistory and doesn’t reappear until 138 AD when Piso’s grandson, Antoninus,became emperor. But from this point the family are mostly known as theAntonines, not the Pisos. In the 73 years between the death of father Piso andthe emergence of Antoninus, the foundations for Christianity were written andproclaimed under assumed names. After the death of his father at the hands ofNero, Piso’s son, Arius, who used a number of names, including Cestius Gallus,was made governor of Syria. This gave him command over the Roman army in Judea.He was involved in the Judean revolt in 66 AD which Vespasian was sent to Judeato quell. Emperor Nero was assassinated in 68 AD by an agent of Piso accordingto Reuchlin. This certainly makes sense if Nero killed his father. With this,the Piso clan threw their power and manipulation behind Vespasian and he becameEmperor of Rome in 69 AD. A year later the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, stole thetemple treasures, including it is claimed the Ark of the Covenant, andapparently took them back to Rome where they entered the secret societyunderground. This underground was nothing less than the Babylonian Brotherhood.Reuchlin says that Arius Calpurnius Piso then wrote three of the Gospels in thefollowing order: The Gospel of Matthew (70–75 AD); the updated Mark (75–80);and, with the help of the Roman writer and statesman, Pliny the Younger, theupdated Luke (85–90). The Gospel of John, the work of Arius’s son, Justus,followed in 105.3 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos468755] As Reuchlin says,‘Jesus’ was a composite figure and the stories include elements of the tales ofJoseph in Egypt and other Old Testament characters, plus some Essene writingsand characteristics of various Pagan gods. This is precisely what the evidence Ihave documented confirms. The several Josephs in the story are all the creationof Piso and part of the code. The letters in the name Piso translate in Hebrewas Yud, Vov, Samech, Fey, and they spell the name, Joseph. Another code Pisoused for himself in the stories is the number 60. Reuchlin points out the manysimilarities between the Jesus story and the one of the Old Testament character,Joseph, which Piso used as a foundation: Joseph had 12 brothers, Jesus 12disciples; Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver, Jesus for 30 pieces ofsilver (inflation); brother Judah suggests the sale of Joseph, Judas sellsJesus; Joseph is in Egypt where the first born are killed, Jesus and family fleeto Egypt to avoid the slaying of male children. Piso uses his four sons as thedisciples, John (Julius), James (Justus), Simon-Peter (Proculus), and Alexander(Andrew).4 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos468846] Julius, Justus andProculus, would go on to write some later New Testament texts. Piso makes Jesusfulfil a number of Old Testament prophecies, particularly those of Isaiah.Reuchlin says that the Pisos made changes and additions to some Old Testamenttexts also, and wrote most of the 14 Old Testament books known as the Apocrypha.These included Esdras, 1 Maccabbees, Judith, Tobit, Bel and the Dragon.5[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos468935] The Pisos were Stoics (henceStoical) and the Stoics believed that people were motivated by, and controllablethrough, the use of fear and hope6 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469023](the very methods of the Babylonian Brotherhood). What better way of describingthe religions which have been spawned by the Old and New Testaments?Another manifestation of Arius Piso was Flavius Josephus, the writer I havequoted once or twice. The reason that Piso, as Josephus, and his granddaughter’shusband Pliny the Younger, do not mention Jesus in their official writings isbecause at the time it simply would not have been credible to do so. It was onlywith the passage of time as the true origin of ‘Jesus’ was lost that the storiesbecame accepted as ‘fact’. The official history of Josephus is that he was aJudean descended from Hasmonean royalty. He fought against the Romans andalthough his friends committed suicide when the revolt went pear-shaped, he gavehimself up and was spared. More than that, we are told he was housed in Rome bythe emperors for 30 years while he wrote books on Jewish ‘history’ and thenmarried his granddaughter into the Roman aristocracy. Oh, do come on. Josephuswas the Roman aristocrat, Arius Calpurnius Piso, and together with his sons andPliny the Younger, they wrote the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament.Pliny wrote a number of the epistles (letters) under the name St Ignatius, andthis same group, under various names, were the early church ‘fathers’. And whowas to turn this Roman invention into the vast prison-religion it was to become?A Roman emperor in the same Babylonian Brotherhood as the Pisos, calledConstantine the Great. What was the vehicle for doing this? The Roman Churchbased in Rome! And wait for this: the Piso family who wrote the Gospel storiesand Constantine the Great who, in effect, was to create the Christian religionas we know it today, were the SAME bloodline! But there’s more, much more. Sixmonths after the first edition of this book was published, I was sent a seriesof detailed genealogical charts entitled History of the First Century which hadbeen posted on the internet on http://www.totse.com/files/FA020/histchr2.htm[http://www.totse.com/files/FA020/histchr2.htm]. It appears they had been lastupdated in 1992. What staggered me was that they read like the index of thisbook (see Appendix 1). They were posted on the internet by researchers fromanother website called The Piso Homepage. The charts follow just some strands ofa bloodline that goes back to Alexander the Great and beyond. Alexanderplundered that key area of Greece, Persia, Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon, theformer lands of Sumer, and India before he died at the age of 33 in 323 BC. Itwas he who established the Egyptian city of Alexandria which became one of themain centres of esoteric knowledge in the ancient world. His bloodline camedown, the charts document, through Cleopatra, that most famous monarch of Egypt,who married the most famous Roman emperor, Julius Caesar, and they produced ason who became Ptolemy XIV. The bloodline goes on to Herod the Great, the Herodin the Jesus stories, who was therefore related to both the Pisos, who wrote theoriginal Gospel texts, and Constantine, who established Christianity as we knowit, a religion based on those stories! This same bloodline became the keyMerovingian bloodline in France, of which much more later, and became the Frenchand British royal dynasties, including the present House of Windsor. And stillmore. As we shall see, all the US presidents from the first, George Washington,to Bill Clinton have been of this same bloodline! This includes George Bush andtherefore his son, George W. Bush, the favourite to be president after the year2,000 election. Stunning confirmation of the themes of this book. I will use thecode (Ramses-Piso-Bush) to indicate everyone named in the book from this pointwho is of this line to Alexander the Great and the Merovingians, etc. Butremember this won’t be all of them and there will be many, many others named inthe book who will also be identified with this same bloodline as the geneaolgyresearch continues.So you can see how Christianity has been manipulated into existence all alongand why it and the Church of Rome have been such a vehicle of control. It isreptilian control. The same with the other religions. Geoffrey Higgins in hisepic work, Anacalypsis, shows how Rome was created as a new Babylon. No wonderChristianity is so awash with Babylonian symbols. The whole thing was a set upto create yet another religion to entrap the human mind, and the hierarchy ofthe Christian Church today know all this! The Church élite have always knownthis because they are part of the secret society stream which created the mythcalled Christianity. Cynical lies like the Turin Shroud, which has beenconnected with the Knights Templar secret society, have been invented toperpetuate the propaganda. The force which invented Jesus and Christianity isthe same force which still controls the world today. For instance, the RomanCollege of Architects was a forerunner of today’s Freemasons, only the name haschanged. The Romans used the same symbols of the square and compass and so on. Atemple used by this college in Pompeii was lost under the eruptions of Vesuviusin 71 AD and excavators have recovered from the temple a hexagram ‘Star ofDavid’, a skull and a black and white tracing board first used by the DionysianArtificers.7 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469112] All these symbols areused by today’s Freemasons.The Judean battle against Rome continued until the final defeat of the Zealotsin 74 AD at Masada, the flat-topped mountain stronghold overlooking the DeadSea. It was the last bastion of the Essene community who had evacuated theirbase further down the coast. As the Judean Zealots were routed by the Romans,many members of the Nazarene secret society headed into Jordan, Mesopotamia,Syria and Turkey, as documented by Julius Africanus, who lived in Turkey around200 AD. Joseph of Arimathea, the biblical ‘uncle’ of Jesus, is said to havetravelled to France to spread the word. The Vatican librarian, CardinalBaronius, said that Joseph first arrived in Marseilles in 35 AD and later wenton to Britain.8 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469283] ‘Mary Magdalene’and offspring of ‘Jesus’ are also said to have headed for the South of Franceafter the ‘crucifixion’. This is the foundation of the Holy Grail story whichclaims that the Jesus bloodline became the Merovingians in France. Well that’scrap because these people didn’t exist and note the source of this story, thelibrarian of the Vatican Library of the Roman Church in Rome. So what was sospecial suddenly about Provence and the South of France? Guess where the Pisofamily had extensive estates? In Gaul and, more specifically, in… Provence!9[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469403] No wonder the ‘vine’(bloodline/knowledge) can be identified in this very part of France. Centurieslater it became one version of the Holy Grail story of so much myth and legendand manifested as the Merovingians. These are the symbolic stories of KingArthur (another ‘Sun’), and they can also be seen in the tarot cards and themusic and art of Europe for centuries. The Grail has been portrayed as the cupor chalice which held the blood of Jesus at the crucifixion. But this blood wasmerely symbolic of the blood which flowed in the ancient rituals in which lambswere sacrificed at the spring equinox and, for the more initiated, thebloodlines which go back to the reptilian ‘gods’. In the early manuscripts ofthe Grail stories, the ‘Holy Grail’ is called the Sangraal. How close this is tothe Sang Raal, the Old French term meaning blood royal. This royal blood, as weshall establish, was the bloodlines of the reptilian-human crossbreeds and hadnothing to do with ‘Jesus’.The Sun god composite, symbolically known as Jesus, was transformed into asupernatural Son of God by the man we call St Paul, whose original name in thestories was Saul of Tarsus. Officially, St Paul was born to Judean parents and,like them, became a Roman citizen, despite being a Pharisee and a strictadherent to the Hebrew religion. Who else was supposed to be a Judean who becamea Roman? Josephus, the pseudonym for Arius Piso, who wrote the Gospels! St Paul,it is said, encouraged the persecution of the early Christians, but had aconversion on the road to Damascus when Jesus miraculously ‘appeared’ to him andasked: “Why do you persecute me?” However, Paul had three versions of his story.In one he heard the voice of Jesus speak to him (Acts 9:7). In another he saw agreat light, but without the voice (Acts 22:9). And in the third, he has Jesusgiving him instructions about his future mission (Acts 26:13). Paul was thecreation of Pliny the Younger (military name, Maximus) and Justus Piso.10[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469535] They introduced into Paul’s storymany of their friends and associates, and characters from the family’s history.For instance, the man called ‘Ananias’ in Acts who cures Paul of blindness wasinspired by Annaeus Seneca who died with father Piso at the hands of Nero.11[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469625] And in Romans, you find the phrase:“Greet Herodion my kinsman”, a code for the Piso family’s connection with Herodthe Great.12 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469718] Paul did not spreadthe Jesus message to Cyprus, Crete, Macedonia, Asia, Greece and Rome. Pliny andthe Pisos did. Between 100 and 105 Justus, his father, and Pliny, together withtheir family, friends and slaves, went to Asia Minor (now Turkey), the Greekcities and Alexandria, among many other places, to ‘encourage’ the poor and theslaves into joining their new faith.13[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469811] The first churches were created inBithynia and Pontus by Pliny. He had visited these places a number of times fromthe year 85 AD and this is the origin of the first name of Pontius Pilate. Hewas only called Pilate in Matthew and Mark, the first gospels written by thePisos, but in Luke, the one Piso wrote with Pliny, Pilate suddenly acquires thename, Pontius. Luke was written in the very years that Pliny began to visitPontus.14 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos469944] Pliny’s letters, writtenunder his own name, say that Justus Piso was in Bithynia in the years 96 and 98using the name, Tullius Justus, and that the Pisos also located in Ephesus, thehome of the cult and temple to the goddess Diana, another version of Isis,Semiramis, Barati, ad infinitum. As they travelled they claimed to be apostlesand bishops, the successors to their inventions, Peter and Paul. They claimed tobe Ignatius (Pliny), Justinus (Justus), Clement of Rome (Julius), Polycarp(Proculus), and Papias (Julianus, son of Justus).15[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470041] By this time, a Piso, PompeiaPlotina (real name Claudia Phoebe), was the wife of the Roman Emperor, Trajan,and so they had tremendous support from the highest level for theirmanipulation.16 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470131] She also appears as‘our sister Phoebe’ and as ‘Claudia’ and ‘Claudine’ in the texts called Romans,Timothy and Clement.17 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470221]The Pisos and Pliny introduced into their stories all the symbols of the Sunreligion and Babylonian Brotherhood myths. They locate their Saul/Paul in Tarsusin Asia Minor (now Turkey), the chief city of the Cilicians. This just happensto be a major centre for the Mithra Sun religion and it was the Cilicians whohad taken this cult to Rome, from where it spread throughout the empire. AsiaMinor was also a region which followed the cult of Dionysus. Both were symbolicSun gods, born on December 25th, who died so our sins could be forgiven.Everything Christians believe about Jesus, the Romans and Persians believedabout Mithra. Sunday was the sacred day for Mithraists because he was a Sun Godand they called this The Lord’s Day. Dionysus was born to a virgin mother, andhe was known as: the Vine, Our Lord, the Saviour, the Judge of the Dead, theDeliverer, the Born Again and the only begotten Son of God. Above the head ofDionysus were the words: “I am Life, Death, and Resurrection, I hold the wingedcrown (the Sun).”18 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470311] The writer, H.G. Wells, pointed out that many of the phrases used by Paul for Jesus were thesame as those used by the followers of Mithra. The Liturgy of Mithra is theLiturgy of Jesus. When Paul says: “They drank from the spiritual rock and thatrock was Christ” (I Corinthians 10:4), he was using exactly the same words foundin the scriptures of Mithra. Only the names were changed. In the Gospels, Peterbecame the Christian ‘rock’ on whom the new church would be built. The VaticanHill in Rome was said to be sacred to Peter, but this place was also claimed,much earlier, to be sacred to Mithra and many Mithric remains have been foundthere! The Piso clan turned Mithra into Myth-ra–Christianity.All the Popes have claimed to rule as the heirs to Peter, the first Pope. Thisclaim derives from a sentence in the Bible which has Jesus saying: “ Thou artPeter, and upon this rock I will build my church.”19[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470539] Only four verses after supposedlymaking Peter the ‘rock’ on which he would build his church, comes thisdemolition of him: “But he (Jesus) turned, and said unto Peter, ‘Get thee behindme Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that beof God, but those that be of men’.”20[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470635] The ‘rock’ is classic mysteryschool symbolism, as is the ‘corner stone’ associated with Jesus and still usedin Freemasonic symbolism today. Peter is supposed to be the custodian of thekeys to Heaven, but this is just a rerun of the mystery school symbol of thetwo-faced Janus, custodian of the key to the Temple of Wisdom and the keys toheaven held by Mithra. And Janus was Eannus, a title for Nimrod in Babylon. Thegold and silver keys of St Peter’s alleged successor, the Pope, are more symbolsof the secret doctrine. The Popes and those who control them know what all thisstuff really means. Gold and silver are the precious metals used to symbolisethe Sun and the Moon. Peter and Paul are both said to have been killed in Romeduring the purge of Christians by the Emperor Nero, but there is no evidence toconfirm this because it didn’t happen. Two other people who were said to havebeen killed by Nero, however, were Lucius Calpurnius Piso, the head of thefamily, and his friend Annaeus Seneca! As the years passed, the Sun religion andthe esoteric symbolism of the mystery schools, were transformed into a religionbased on the literal translation of symbolic texts.On this misunderstanding and deceit Christianity was built. We are led tobelieve that the Christian Church emerged as one unit, but this is simply nottrue. There were many factions across a wide spectrum of views arguing andbattling for supremacy as the holders of ‘the truth’. The fiercest conflictensued between the followers of the St Paul version of Jesus as the supernaturalSon of God, and the Arians, who believed he was a man, not God. The Arians werenamed after Arius, a churchman in Alexandria, Egypt, who questioned that Jesuscould be the same as God. Had not Jehovah said that he was the only God? Howthen could God be in three parts as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? The‘trinity’ is a Pagan concept and part of Babylonian and Egyptian belief. Now ifwe lived in a world full of mature adults, we would allow people the respect andfreedom to believe anything they like so long as they don’t impose it on others.Just because we may think it is wrong or a nonsense should not matter. Myproblem with Christianity and religion in general is not that anyone believesit, that is their right, what I challenge is the way it has been imposed uponpeople through the use of fear, guilt, violence and the suppression ofalternative thought. Unfortunately, allowing people the right to believesomething you don’t, has become a criminal offence and so the Paulines and theArians insisted on crushing each other. At this point, enter Constantine theGreat, who, together with the Pisos, his ancesters, and Pliny, was the creatorof what became known as Christianity.Constantine was made Emperor of the Roman Empire in 312 AD. He won a reputationas a brave and ruthless soldier and served in Britain for a time before beingelected as Caesar of the West. He then began to kill his rivals, including manyof their children, as he sought to be emperor of all. In one of his battles forthe Roman leadership, at Milvian Bridge near Rome, the Christian legend claimsthat he saw a vision of a cross in the sky with the words: “By this Conquer”.The next night, so it is said, he had a vision of Jesus who told him to put thecross on his flag to guarantee victory over his enemies. Good story, but theword bollocks* is drifting across my mind. Constantine was said to have beenconverted to Christianity by his visions, but there’s one tiny problem withthat. He never did become a Christian, except perhaps on his deathbed as a bitof insurance. He worshipped the Greek god Apollo (the Sun), and the Sol Invictus(Unconquered Sun), and he remained to his death the Pontifex Maximus of thePagan Church! As a result, Jesus was given the Sun’s birthday of December 25thwhich has remained ever since. Constantine is also responsible for the greatChristian shrine in Jerusalem. His mother, Helena, was dispatched to the city totrack down the places and relics of the Christian story. It was she who claimedto have found the exact locations of the birth of Jesus, the crucifixion, histomb and where he ascended into the sky. You can still find them all on theguided tour of Jerusalem! Constantine built a basilica in 326 AD on the site hismother said the crucifixion took place and on the same spot today stands theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre which attracts millions of Christians to see where‘Jesus died on the cross’. Helena also claimed to have found the three woodencrosses around 300 years after the event. What a clever lady she must have been.The truth went far deeper, however. Constantine was a member of the sameBabylonian Brotherhood through which the Pisos and Pliny operated. The Basilicawhich Constantine built in Jerusalem is part of the sacred geometric pattern ofthis city according to some researchers. The Roman College of Architects wereconnected with the Order of Comacine Masters who expanded rapidly under thereigns of Constantine and Theodosius as Christianity was becoming the dominantreligion of the Roman Empire.21 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470728]Both were important branches of the Brotherhood underground. The Order ofComacine based themselves on the island of Comacini in Lake Como in northernItaly. Lake Como, which today is close to the Swiss drug money launderingcentres like Lugano, is a very important centre for the Babylonian Brotherhood.Two of its modern British members, Prince Philip and his mentor, LordMountbatten, attended a meeting of the Brotherhood’s Bilderberg Group at LakeComo in 1965. The Order of Comacine was divided into lodges headed by GrandMasters and they wore white gloves and aprons and communicated through secretsigns and handshakes.22 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470841] All thiswas happening more than a thousand years before the official creation ofFreemasonry! They were given the patronage of the king of Lombardy and were mademasters of all masons and architects in Italy.23[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos470925] It was this secret order, thesuccessors to the earlier Brotherhood architects, the Dionysian Artificers, whoprovided the bridge between those who built the ancient Pagan temples and theirbrethren, who would build the great Christian cathedrals of Europe. The sameBrotherhood built both! The ancient temples were shrines to the Pagan deities,and the Christian cathedrals were also shrines to the Pagan deities. The onlydifference was that, with the latter, the public thought they were built toworship ‘Jesus’. The famous Christian hero, St Bernard, defined God as ‘length,width, height and depth’ because he understood the effect of geometry andnumbers on the energy fields. Pythagoras also stated that: “number is all”. Thepower of pattern, numbers, geometry and proportion, are some of the ‘greatmysteries’ that have been denied the mass of the people.Clearly Constantine, and the Brotherhood which controlled the emperors, sawpolitical advantage in supporting the Christian movement. And the people wouldhave had no problem encompassing Jesus into their belief system because thestory matched that of the other Sun gods of the time, including Mithra.Christianity picked up many followers of Mithra because to them it was nodifferent to what they already believed except for the name. Constantine endedthe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire by issuing his Edict of Milan,but this was not specific to Christianity, though it stopped the persecutionagainst all one-God religions. Anyway, as one persecution ended another was soonto begin, as the Roman Church persecuted, burned and tortured anyone who refusedto believe in the Christian faith, or even their version of the faith. Tens ofmillions of people have died in the name of the so-called ‘Prince of Peace’.Appropriately, Constantine murdered his wife and elder son before making thejourney in 325 AD to his palace at Nicaea (now Iznik in Turkey) to decide whatChristians to this day must believe. He wanted to end the conflict between thePaulines and the Arians and install a single Christian creed. He called 318bishops (another mystical number) together at Nicaea to tell them what theircreed was going to be. Bitter arguments erupted between the factions on theburning issue for the future of the world: Was Jesus part of a trinity ofFather, Son and Holy Ghost? Holy shit. Documents were torn up and blows werestruck. If you are a Christian, this is how your faith was decided. The Arianslost the day and out of this mayhem and Roman dictatorship came the foundationbelief of Christianity, the Nicene Creed. This dog’s breakfast was as follows. Ihope you are concentrating, I’ll be asking questions later:“We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things, both visibleand invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son of God, begotten of theFather, only begotten, that is to say, of the same substance of the Father, Godof God and Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made, being ofone substance with the father, by whom all things were made, both things inheaven and things on earth; who, for us men and our salvation, came down andmade flesh, made man, suffered and rose again on the third day, went up to theheavens, and is to come again to judge the quick and the dead; and in the holyghost.”Simple eh? It was decided that Jesus was the same substance as the fatherbecause in ancient Babylon it was said that Nimrod and his son, Tammuz, were thesame person. His mother, Queen Semiramis, was titled the Holy Spirit. So theFather, Son and Holy Ghost, are in fact Nimrod-Tammuz and Semiramis.Christianity is the religion of Babylon and has been from the start. Today Romeand Italy remain a major Brotherhood centre, as I detail in …And The Truth ShallSet You Free. The Vatican itself is wholly controlled by the Brotherhood and oneof its most important bases.Christianity, like Judaism and Islam, was designed to achieve another vital partof the reptilian Agenda: the suppression of the female energy, the intuitiveconnection to higher levels of our multidimensional consciousness. Once yousuppress your feminine energy, your intuition, you switch off your higherconsciousness and become dominated by your lower consciousness. You are isolatedfrom your highest expression of love, wisdom and knowledge, and at the mercy ofthe manipulated ‘information’ bombarding your eyes and ears. This is why theBrotherhood have sought to create a world in which the male energy has calledthe shots, on the surface at least. The state of being we know as ‘macho man’ isa person disconnected from his female energy and therefore deeply imbalanced.Note that there is no mention of women in Constantine’s Nicene Creed. It saysthat God became flesh as Jesus “for us men and our salvation”. Christianity wasa male bastion from its very foundation, created to suppress the balancingfemale energy. The early founders of the Church, like Quintus Tertullian, bannedwomen from priestly office and even speaking in church. It was only at theCouncil of Trent in 1545 that the Roman Church officially agreed that women hadsouls and then only by a majority of three votes! The seeds of thisanti-feminine dogma in the Christian Church can be seen in its mirror,Zoroasterism, the sect of the prophet (mythical Sun god), Zoroaster. He and hisreligion emerged yet again from Persia, now Turkey, the home of the TaurusMountains and St Paul’s abode, Tarsus. Zoroaster was vehemently anti-women andhe said that “no women could enter Heaven except those ‘submissive to control,who had considered their husbands lords’”. This whole philosophy is an almostword-for-word repeat of Brahmanism, the appalling Hindu creed which wasintroduced by the Aryans to India many centuries before. St Paul (the Pisos andPliny) continued the anti-feminine agenda in Christianity and set the scene forthe horrific suppression of women over nearly two thousand years. Among StPaul’s little gems are:“Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife as Christis the head of the Church. Now if the Church submits to Christ so should wivessubmit to their husbands in everything.”And:“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but tobe in silence.”The Christian Church was built to represent and perpetuate the extreme malevibration, the Sun energy, and to keep the ancient knowledge secret. TheChristian Church became a crucial and highly effective vehicle to removeknowledge from circulation so it could be used secretly and malevolently frombehind the scenes. The assault on the balancing female energy and the hoardingof knowledge resulted in the persecution of ‘witches’ – channellers, mediums,psychics and seers of all kinds. These communications with other realms had beenan everyday part of pre-Christian life. Channellers were given names likeprophets, oracles, vessels of God and such like. One of the leaders of thiswitch-hunt was Jerome, born in 341, who is credited with gathering the texts forthe main Latin version of the ‘Holy Bible’. It was Jerome who persuaded the Popeto outlaw channelling (psychic communications with other dimensions). By thissingle papal decree, the vessels of God became vessels and witches of the Devil,terms still used by many Christians. King James I (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the firstking of both England and Scotland, included a bitter condemnation of witches inhis King James Bible in 1611 and he was true to his word as he had thousands ofwomen tortured and executed for being witches. Jerome wanted the priests to bethe middle men between humanity and God. He did not want people going direct,contradicting the official line, or circulating unapproved knowledge. As hesaid:“We tell them (the channellers) that we do not so much reject prophecy, asrefuse to receive prophets whose utterances fail to accord with the Scripturesold and new.”24 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471009]Yet at the same time the initiates of the Babylonian Brotherhood which createdthe Roman Church were using these same psychic powers and modes ofinter-dimensional communication. OK, how else can we control and diminish thegreat unwashed? We’ve got them to believe a fantasy about Jesus and we’ve connedthem to think that after one life on Earth, God decides if they go to heaven orhell. We have also conned them to think that we, the men in frocks, know how Godwants them to live and that anything to do with the esoteric is the Devil.Anything else? Hey, we need to be careful about that sexual energy, the creativeforce. Got to shut that down or their power source will still be there. I’ve gotjust the man. I say, Augustine, in my office, please. Saint Augustine of Hippo,like most of the early Church heroes, was from North Africa. He couldn’t getenough sex earlier in his life, but after his alleged conversion to Christianityat the age of 31, he switched dramatically and decided that sex was horrid. Youknow what smokers are like when they stop. He would not allow a woman into hishouse unaccompanied, even his sister. He couldn’t think of another way ofproducing children, so unless the race was to die out, he was stuck with it.However, he insisted that on no account should you enjoy it. I’ve tried thatmate, and it doesn’t work. This was Augustine’s view of sexuality:“Husbands love your wives, but love them chastely. Insist on the work of theflesh only in such measure as is necessary for the procreation of children.Since you cannot beget children in any other way, you must descend to it againstyour will, for it is the punishment of Adam.”These attitudes led, in stages, to the imposition of celibacy on priests by PopeGregory VII in 1074. Yes, we have celibate priests in the Roman Catholic Churchtoday because of what one pope decided a thousand years ago and countlesschildren, abused by sexually frustrated and messed up churchmen, have taken theconsequences. Augustine connected sex with original sin, the idea that we areborn sinners because of our link back to Adam and Eve. Jesus, so this theorygoes, was the only one born without original sin because he was conceived by avirgin birth. But what about his mother? She must have had original sin and sosome of it must have been passed on to him. Eventually, the Roman Church couldsee the contradiction and they decreed that Mary, too, was a virgin birth. Butwhat about her mother? Did she have original sin? If so, it must have beenpassed on to Mary. My God, please stop me before I disappear up my own orifice.What garbage it all is. But billions of people have been controlled andmanipulated in this way since the Christian creed sank its fangs of fear, guiltand violence, deep into the human spirit. Actually I believe in original sinmyself. Some of my ‘sins’ have been very original. If you are going to sin, makeit original, that’s what I say.Our spiritual, mental, emotional and physical levels of being are connected byvortices of energy known as chakras (a Sanskrit word meaning: wheels of light).It is through these chakra vortices that imbalances on one level are passed onto another (see Figure 18). Thus when we get very emotionally stressed, thefirst thing that happens is that we stop thinking straight. The imbalance on theemotional level is transmitted to the mental level. This is eventually passedonto the physical level if the imbalance is not corrected and this is how stressand emotional upset causes illness and disease or dis-ease. These emotionalimbalances manifest in the physical body as chemical reactions and it is thesereactions that official medicine (the transnational drug corporations) seeks to‘treat’ at unbelievable cost in both money and long term effects on the body.They treat the symptom, not the cause, because most doctors are soin-doctor-rinated that they have no idea how the body really works and what thehuman being really is. Those that control the drug corporations do know,however, and they use every means possible to suppress ‘alternative’ healingmethods which treat the cause and not the symptom.It is also the chakras which suck energy into our consciousness field and in afully functioning state we take in vast amounts of energy, particularly throughthe base chakra at the bottom of the spine. From there it moves through theseven major chakras going up along the spine and out through the crown chakra atthe top of the head. I explain all this in detail in other books like I Am Me IAm Free. For reasons I will go into in a later chapter, the more energy we suckinto our energy field, the more power we have to create and control our owndestiny. It is vital, therefore, that those who wish to diminish and dominate usfind ways to limit the amount of energy we absorb. This is where themanipulation of sex comes in. The three lowest chakras are the base, the sexualchakra just above that, and then the chakra connected to our emotional level inthe solar plexus. It is this chakra which stimulates the ‘butterflies’ and‘nervous stomachs’ when we are worried or stressed. So the Christian and ‘moral’attitudes to sex close down the base chakra and what energy it does absorb isthrown into turmoil when it hits the sexual and emotional chakras because of allthe fear and guilt surrounding the subject. This imbalances and diminishes theentire human energy-consciousness field. Most Christian clerics have no ideathat this is so, but those who have controlled Christianity and the Roman Churchcertainly do, because they are in the knowledge stream that has been suppressedin the general population. Each generation has been conditioned to think theChristian way about sex, whether consciously or subconsciously, and they in turnhave helped to condition the next generation to think the same. But sex iswonderful. It is to be enjoyed. The ability to express your love physically foranother human being is an incredible gift. I don’t care what your sexuality maybe. Love is love is love. Let’s express it. If Augustine or the Pope want to tiea knot in theirs, fair enough, everyone to their own, as long as they don’t tellme how to live my life.[../Images/00032.jpg]Figure 18: The human ‘chakra’ or vortex system which interpenetrates our levelsof being. When they are open we connect with the cosmos and draw in limitlessamounts of energy. When they are closed we are disconnected from the cosmos andoperate on a fraction of our mental, emotional, physical and spiritualpotential.In the East, Asia and China, they have retained the understanding of the powerof sexual energy over thousands of years and this knowledge has been practisedin the West in the secret societies and Satanic rituals. Once again the sexualenergy is just that, energy, and can be used to create or destroy. In theEastern religions, the conscious creation and stimulation of sexual energy isknown as Tantra. Sexual intercourse is seen, quite rightly, as the union andbalance of the male and female, the yang (male) and yin (female). The idea ofTantric sex is to stimulate the sexual energy held in the base of the spine, theKundalini energy as it has become known. This was symbolised as uncurlingserpents and in Tantra the participants control and delay orgasm to transformthe kundalini from its original state (ching) into the higher energy (ch’i) andfinally its highest expression (shen). This is done by raising the energy up thespine and down again until it has reached a vibratory state that can reconnectthe person with the cosmos. By the end of this book you will see the importanceof this and its scientific basis. When the kundalini explodes into your energyfield as it did with me in 1990–91, it can blow you away mentally, emotionallyand spiritually, sometimes physically too, until you have mastered its power.Stimulating the kundalini is described as ‘lighting the inner fire’. Mine wasn’ta fire, it was a nuclear strike! Tantra is designed to complete this process ina more controlled way, but sometimes the uncontrolled way offers a more extremeand enlightening experience. Once the Kundalini is awakened, you have a constantsupply of enormously powerful energy with which to create whatever you choose.The Satanists use sex as a fundamental part of their ritual so they can tap thissexual, kundalini force, for their horrendous purposes. But it can equally beused to set us free and hence the Christian obsession with making sex into adirty, immoral, guilt-ridden experience which suppresses or imbalances thekundalini energy and delinks the person from their cosmic levels of self.The compilation of the Bible was yet another farce. If you ask most people aboutthe Gospel writers, they will usually tell you that Matthew, Mark, Luke and Johnwere the disciples of Jesus. That’s the impression people get and are encouragedto get, but it’s not true and not even the Church claims that officially. TheGospels and other books of the Bible are only those chosen by the hierarchy ofthe Christian Church from those written by the Pisos and Pliny and the manycopies and offshoots which followed. Many other texts were available that werejust as valid, often very much more so, than those which made it into the ‘HolyBook’. Texts were rejected, destroyed or rewritten to fit the official line andthe philosopher, Celsus, wrote of the church leaders in the third century:“You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of making them seemlikely… You have altered three, four times and oftener, the texts of your ownGospels in order to deny objections to you.”25[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471135]In 1958, a manuscript was discovered at a monastery at Mar Saba, east ofJerusalem, which shows how the Jesus story was rewritten by the Church wheneverit suited them at the time. It was found by an American, Morton Smith,26[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471226] Professor of Ancient History atColumbia University, and it included the content of a letter by Bishop Clementof Alexandria, Egypt, an early Christian father, to a colleague called Theodore.It also revealed an unknown segment of Mark’s Gospel which had been suppressed.It included in the ‘Jesus’ story some details of mystery school initiations andit was an account of the raising of Lazarus by Jesus, the famous raising fromthe dead. In this suppressed text Lazarus called to Jesus before any ‘raising’took place, so proving that he was not supposed to be physically dead. There wasalso another devastating revelation for Christianity. The manuscript makesreferences to the effect that Jesus was understood to have engaged in possiblehomosexual practices involving the ‘rich young man’ mentioned in Mark’sGospel.27 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471381] Let me stress that I amnot condemning homosexuality here. Good luck to those who wish to live theirlives in this way so long as it’s the choice of all concerned. I am making thepoint that the Christian hierarchy have been deceiving and lying to theirfollowers right from the start. Bishop Clement’s letter was replying to aChristian who was very perturbed to be told the above story of ‘Jesus’ by theGnostic group called the Carpocrates. It had apparently been leaked to them byan official in Alexandria. Clement’s advice, after confirming the story, wasthat anything which contradicts the official church view must be denied, even ifit is true. The letter says of those who question official orthodoxy:“For even if they should say something true, one who loves the Truth should not,even so, agree with them… To them one must never give way; nor, when they putforward their falsifications, should one concede that the secret Gospel is byMark – but should deny it on oath. For not all true things are to be said to allmen.”28 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471474]Clement was summing up the attitude of the Brotherhood and their religiousfronts throughout history. Most members of the Church follow the party linebecause that is what they are conditioned to believe, but within these‘religions’ are the secret sects which know the truth. They are organisationswithin organisations or an organisation (the reptilian Brotherhood) withinorganisations. It was such people who created the religion in the first placeand compiled and translated the Bible, the book that was to mind control theworld for centuries and, to a very large extent, still does. Jerome becamesecretary to Pope Damasus in about 382 and he was commissioned to bring varioustexts together to produce the Bible in Latin, the official language of Rome. Nowwe had another translation, the Hebrew and Greek into Latin, plus Jerome’s ownprejudices. His version is known as the Vulgate, from the Latin Vulgata, meaningin common use. The English derivative, vulgar, meaning ‘in poor taste’, wouldhave been a better description. Jerome edited the texts as he saw fit andrejected those which didn’t support the creed of Nicaea. He worked with anotherchurch ‘father’, the sex bomb, Augustine. Jerome and Augustine both agreed thatwomen were morally and spiritually inferior and that sex and earthly pleasureswere a source of evil which kept men from their spiritual path. Poor sods. Theyexamined 13 gospels, nine acts and teachings of the Apostles, plus 31 lettersand other writings. They decided which were ‘orthodox’ and which were to berejected. Their choice was supported by the Council of Carthage in 397 andconfirmed again by Pope Innocent I a hundred years later. Jerome’s Vulgate Biblebecame widely accepted as the version. The Council of Trent in 1545 decreed thatit was the only acceptable one for Roman Catholics.Most Christians could not understand what it said because they didn’t readLatin, but they could rely on the priests to tell them what it said they shoulddo. People were condemned and killed for the crime of translating the Bible intoEnglish because doing so allowed millions to actually read the texts the priestswere using to control and terrify them. In 553 AD, the belief in reincarnationwas outlawed at the Second Synod Council of Constantinople under the influenceof the Emperor Justinian. The council decided, without the attendance of thePope, that: “If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls and shallsubmit to the monstrous doctrine that follows from it, let him be…excommunicated”. The ‘monstrous doctrine’ was that we live forever on an eternaljourney of evolution through experience and we are all responsible for ouractions in this physical life or a future one. An acceptance of reincarnationtook away the power of the heaven or hell mob to frighten people into doing asthey, sorry, ‘God’, said. The knowledge continued to be sucked from the publicdomain. After Constantine the Great, came other emperors who influenced thecourse of the fast emerging Christian creed. Among them was Theodosius (marriedinto the Constantine bloodline) who made Christianity the official religion ofthe empire in 380. The power of the men in frocks grew enormously as theBabylonian priesthood dropped anchor in Rome. Anyone who strayed even marginallyfrom the official beliefs was brutally executed and their documents destroyed –exactly the Nimrod doctrine of Babylon. This is not just a bunch of power crazedpsychopaths, ad-libbing their way through this grotesque slaughter, it was acoldly calculated plan to rule by terror and in doing so, take any otherknowledge or versions of life out of public circulation. As reptilians and thepuppets of reptilians, they wanted to create a mental and emotional prison cell,outside of which it was fatal to tread.The marauding Visigoths, a Germanic (Aryan) people who occupied southern France,eventually sacked Rome in 410, but by then the Roman Church had such a grip onthe minds of so many in the former Roman Empire, that where the Roman emperorsleft off, the Popes would take over. The Roman dictatorship became a papaldictatorship and in the centuries that followed, Europe became a landscape ofuntold slaughter. The Pope ruled and who ruled the Pope? The BabylonianBrotherhood, exactly as they do today. The Hebrew and Christian religions arethe inventions of those who controlled the underground stream of secretknowledge. Even the ritual garbs are the same in so many ways. What do Jewishpeople wear? Skull caps. What does the Pope wear? A skull cap. This is symbolicof the way priests in the mystery schools used to shave the backs of theirheads. The more formal headgear and ritual of Judaism and Christianity are alsovery similar because they originate from the same source and the Pope’s mitre isthe fish head symbol of Nimrod.To complete the trio, along came the skull-cap-wearing Muslims and the creed ofIslam, inspired by the ‘Prophet’ Mahomet (Mohammed) when he had a ‘vision’ inthe year 612. Once more we find that Islam’s roots are in Christianity andJudaism and therefore Babylon. Muslims see Islam as an updated continuation ofthe Judeo-Christian stream and they, too, trace their ancestry back to our oldmate, Abraham, who is said to have emerged from the Sumerian city of Ur andheaded for Egypt. They believe that Abraham built the Kaaba, the sacred shrineat Mecca, and the focus of pilgrimage for Muslims all over the world. But it wasin fact originally a Pagan temple of goddess (Semiramis) worship featuring thefamous Black Stone. W. Wynn Westcott, founder of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, wrote in his work, The Magical Mason, that the Black Stone supposedto have been brought to Mecca by Abraham, was used originally for ancient Paganritual.29 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471624] Again you see Brotherhoodsymbolism in this ‘new’ religion. The symbols of the crescent and the curvedsword, the scimitar, are identified with the Moon and Venus, the Morning Star,the term used for Lucifer. Venus was also a title for Queen Semiramis. Muslimshave bought the idea that Moses, King David and Jesus were divine prophets sentby the one All Mighty God, when in fact all three are Brotherhood inventions.Their holy book, the Koran, which was supposed to be inspired by God, mentionsJesus in 93 verses and treats him as a living person. Islam was created by thesame Brotherhood networks as the Christian religions, to further imprison,divide and rule. Mohammed was the last prophet and therefore, the Muslimsreckon, the most valid. As such, all Christians and Jews should convert toIslam, the orthodox Muslims demand. The term, Jihad, is the ‘Holy War’ thatMuslims are urged to wage against all who do not accept the creed of Mohammed.How fitting that Islam means ‘to submit or surrender’ and Muslim means ‘one whosubmits’. Some of the bloodiest conflict in history has resulted from the desireof Islam, Christianity and Judaism to impose their creed on each other, whenthey all come from the same source and the same manipulation! Excuse me, did Icome in late and miss something? Beam me up Scotty, get me out of here…The Islamic god Allah is the same ‘god’, the Muslims say, as theJudeo-Christian, Jehovah. The Koran is the Islamic holy book, but Muslims alsogive credence to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testamentattributed to Moses. In truth they were written by the Levites after Babylon andnot by ‘Moses’, which was a title in the Egyptian mystery schools. Is it reallya coincidence that these three massive prisons of the mind, suppressors of thefemale and creators of bloody conflict, should all come from the same part ofthe world and be based on the same sources? Or that people having visions andvisitations should play such a crucial part in the formation and legend whichcreated these monsters? Mohammed said he had his vision near the cave where heused to go. Caves and dark places constantly recur in stories of religioussuperstars and Sun gods like Mithra and Jesus. Mohammed said his visitor claimedto be the Angel Gabriel of biblical fame and during the encounter Mohammed saidhe lost consciousness and entered a trance state. While Mohammed was in histrance or hypnotic state, ‘Gabriel’ gave him a message to remember and recite.Mohammed said that when he awoke the message was inscribed upon his heart. Whatfollowed the encounter with ‘Gabriel’ was a bloodbath spanning the centuries tothe present day, as Mohammed and his successors sought to impose their creed onthe world. Islam is not the opposite of Christianity and Judaism, they are all‘oppo-sames’: the same state of mind with a different name, ultimatelycontrolled by the same people, the reptilians. Islam is another mystery schoolreligion, its texts written in esoteric code for the masses to take literally.There were times in later centuries when some of this secret knowledge wasallowed into the public domain by more enlightened Muslim leaders and this wasthe inspiration for the advanced societies and science which came out of MuslimSpain and Baghdad. Today, part of the Brotherhood Agenda is to stimulateconflict with the Islamic nations by causing division between the Muslim andChristian-Jewish world.The Mormon Church is another ‘vision’ religion which very powerfully locks intothe Brotherhood network, as all religions do. The Mormon Church, or moreformally, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, was founded by JosephSmith (Ramses-Piso-Bush) after he claimed an ‘angel’ called Moroni appeared tohim in 1823. Moroni, he said, told him of the existence of a book of gold platescontaining: “the fullness of the everlasting gospel” and “an account of theformer inhabitants of this continent and the sources from which they sprang”.The location was revealed to him, and in 1827 with help from two ‘magic stones’called Urim and Thummim, he translated the plates into English. Urim and Thummimwere, in fact, the names of knucklebones or dice used by Levite priests and theKings of Israel were said to follow their prophecies. They were used in themystery school holy place known as the Tabernacle. Here we have yet anotherreligion originating from the same source and another perpetuation of the Jesusmyth. The gold plates, Smith said, were written in ‘reformed Egyptian’. Fromthis came the Book of Mormon two years later and his followers became the MormonChurch in 1830. The pillars of the early church were Smith, his brother Hiram,and another guy called Brigham Young. They were all high degree Freemasons andthe expansion of this church was funded by Kuhn, Loeb and Company, theRothschild Bank in the United States30[../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos471812] which also helped to fund theRussian Revolution and both sides in the First World War. The Mormons were aBrotherhood creation. Mormons recognise the Bible, but claim that Smith’swritings are equally divine. They set up communities called Stakes of Zion(Sion, the Sun) and eventually settled in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Mormon cityfrom where its mind control programmes are orchestrated, as I shall document ina later chapter. Funny how all these religions are justified by a vision orvisitation, followed by an extreme, dogmatic and autocratic religion which rulesby fear, indoctrination and mind manipulation.So the Rothschilds funded the Mormons and they did the same for another blackmagic mind control sect which emerged from Christianity/Judaism called TheWatchtower Society or Jehovah’s Witnesses, who worship the Hebrew angry god,Jehovah. One of their leading founders was Charles Taze Russell(Ramses-Piso-Bush) , close friend of the Rothschilds, and one of the RussellIlluminati bloodlines. Russell was a high degree Freemason, a black occultistand, according to his wife, a paedophile. The symbol of the Watchtower is partof black occultism. He and his organisation had tremendous support from theRothschild-Illuminati front, B’nai B’rith. These religions were set up tocontrol, to create conflict between people, and to divide and rule the masses.Visions of biblical characters like the Virgin Mary which have enhancedmainstream Christian beliefs over the centuries have followed a similar pattern.We have no idea what the Jesus ‘team’ looked like, but people always see them astheir classic artistic depiction. Those who have seen visions which relate tothe Bible stories have had shrines built to them, but those who see visionswhich are not biblical are condemned as working with the Devil. William Cooper,a former operative with United States Naval Intelligence, said he had seensecret documents which claim that extraterrestrials had told the US authoritiesthat they had manipulated the human race via religion, Satanism, witchcraft,magic and the occult. Certainly, the human race has been manipulated andcontrolled through religion and Satanism. The only question is, areextraterrestrials (or inner-terrestrials) behind this? As Cooper asks: “…werethey indeed the source of our religions with which they had been manipulating usall along?”31 [../Text/index_split_019.html#filepos472005]The answer, I would suggest, is a very loud: “Yes”.* American readers, I understand, do not know the meaning of the British term,‘bollocks’.

These were Nimrodworshippers and, appropriately, the very name of Italy derives from the wordbull – a Nimrod symbol.Once again they travelled under the heading of Phoenicians and they settled inthe north of Italy in 466 AD in what is now Venice. These Phoenicians thenbecame known as Venetians. They built a powerful maritime (of course) andfinancial empire which was based on lending people money that does not exist andcharging them interest on it. This is another common theme of the BabylonianBrotherhood over thousands of years and today this financial scam controls thepurse strings of the planet. When you go to a bank for a loan, the bank does notprint a single new note or mint a single new coin. It simply types into youraccount the size of the loan and from that moment you start to pay interest onwhat is nothing more than figures on a screen. The bank has created ‘money’ outof nothing and insist that you pay them for doing so. If anyone else did that,they would be arrested for fraud, but the banks do it every day quite legally.This system was employed in Babylon and it has been expanded over thousands ofyears. It has rarely been challenged because the Brotherhood which devised thissystem have also controlled the kings, queens and leading politicians, who haveimposed it on the people. More than that, the Brotherhood are the kings, queensand leading politicians! The ‘money’ created in this way is known as ‘fiat’money.The Phoenician-Venetians, under the control of the Babylonian Brotherhood,expanded their wealth and power by war, assassinations, piracy and by ruthlesslymanipulating trade and money. They would support a country when it suited themand then immediately seek to destroy it if that advanced their Agenda. One oftheir common methods was to bankrupt any person, business or country thatopposed them. If that sounds exactly like the methods in use globally today,there is a reason for that. The same Brotherhood now control the world bankingand trading system via the central banking network, the World Bank, theInternational Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the Bank ofInternational Settlements and so on. The reptile-Aryans of Venice married intothe nobility, bought themselves titles, and simply invented others. As a result,from around 1171, they became known throughout Europe as the ‘Black Nobility’(Ramses-Piso-Bush overwhelmingly, if not entirely!). Once again the Phoenicians(or rather the reptile-Phoenicians) became the aristocracy. They operated acrossnorthern Italy to Genoa and into an area that became known as Lombardy, goingnorth into what is now Switzerland. Lombard is still a word widely used in thefinancial industry and Lombard Street is one of the best known streets in theCity of London financial centre. Northern Italy or Lombardy was the regioninvaded around the fourth century BC by Aryan ‘Celts’ called the Lombards whobrought an influx of Nordic blood from Germany. They were later absorbed byanother Aryan people, the Franks, from where we get the name France. In short,they were different branches of the same white race with the reptile-Aryans,unknown to the rest of the population, invariably at the helm. As today, thesereptilians and reptilian puppets looked human, but they were controlled withinby a very different force working to a long term Agenda. Long term in ourperception, anyway. Switzerland remains a fundamentally important financialstronghold for the Brotherhood. This is why it is never attacked and never takespart in wars, even when every country along its borders is involved. Switzerlandis a major financial centre for the people who are creating the wars and so theyensure it is not involved. See how simple history becomes when you know theAgenda!Venice was for centuries a hub of the reptile bloodlines who expanded into theFar East with the journeys of the Venetian, Marco Polo, of whom there is farmore to know than official history suggests. The surviving royal families inEurope are the reptile bloodline of this Black Nobility, including Britain’sHouse of Windsor. This is why these royal houses, including the Windsors, arerife with Satanism and fundamentally connected with Freemasonry and other Elitesecret societies. I will chart the history of the Windsors, their grotesquerecord of manipulation, and their reptilian-Satanic activities, in a laterchapter. The Black Nobility established close relationships with the bloodlinefamilies of Britain and they were behind the invasion in 1066 by another branchof their ‘family’, the Normans of William the Conqueror and the St Clairs, afamily of Viking descent. Once again the Black Nobility married into the Britisharistocratic families, awarded themselves titles, or invented them out ofnothing. Two families were especially important in the Black Nobility takeoverof Britain, the Savoys and the Estes. The Savoys (after which the famous Londonhotel is named) ruled Italy from 1146 to 1945 and the Estes ruled the regioncalled Ferrara from the 1100s until 1860 when Italy became one country. Thereare countless examples of how the Black Nobility infiltrated and took overBritain. Eleanor, the daughter of Peter, the ninth Count of Savoy, married theEnglish king, Henry III. Peter ‘Savoy’, the Black Nobility count, was givenlarge estates in England by Henry after he married his daughter and thisincluded the title of the Earl of Richmond. From this foothold the BlackNobility count, now the Earl of Richmond, arranged a series of other marriagesbetween the Black Nobility and the English aristocracy. His younger brother,Boniface, was even made Archbishop of Canterbury! The Black Nobility have beencontrolling the Church of England for centuries, indeed from the start, andtoday one of their most active representatives, Queen Elizabeth II, is still theofficial head of the Church. The Black Nobility bloodlines are reptilianfull-bloods and crossbreeds and pure Babylonian Brotherhood. For Black Nobilityread Ramses-Piso-Bush. They seized the reins of power in Europe to take theirAgenda into another stage.The founders of the European royal houses, many of which continue to this day,were Rupert, the Count of Nassau, and Christian, Count of Oldenbourg. Both livedin the 11th and 12th centuries, the very period when the BlackNobility-Babylonian Brotherhood launched its plan to control the whole ofEurope. From Rupert came the Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Cassal lines, the Dukesof Luxembourg, the Battenborgs/Battenbergs (later Mountbattens), the Prince ofOrange and Nassau, and the Kings of the Netherlands. From Christian came theKings of Denmark and Norway, the Schleswig-Holstein line and the Hanovers, whobecame Kings of England. It was from the Hanovers that the present House ofWindsor is derived. Other Black Nobility-reptile bloodlines included the Dukesof Normandy (like William the Conqueror, hence their support for him and the StClairs), the Saxe-Coburgs (another Windsor bloodline), and the Plantagenets whoproduced the Tudor and Stuart monarchs of England. Here you see how the Englisharistocracy and the monarchs on the English throne have in fact been the BlackNobility. The Scottish nobility, the clans and the ruling aristocratic familieslike the St Clairs, the Bruces and others I have mentioned, are also the BlackNobility in disguise, the reptile-Aryans from the ancient world. Of course theyfight among themselves for power and many of them will not be aware of who theyare and what is controlling them, but they are the same Anunnaki–reptilianbloodlines and invariably find themselves in the positions of royal, religiousand political power.Many of today’s most famous financial and business families are members of theBlack Nobility lines of the Babylonian Brotherhood. The Warburg banking dynastyis in fact of the Abraham del Banco family, the biggest banking family in Venicewhen the city was at the height of its powers and influence. The Agnelli family,famous for the car giant, Fiat (remember fiat money?), is another of these BlackNobility bloodlines. This is why the Agnellis control Italy and dictate to itsgovernments. Another of the most powerful Black Nobility families of Venice werethe de Medicis (Ramses-Piso-Bush) and it was they who sponsored the journey ofChristopher Columbus to ‘discover’ the Americas. The reason for that will becomeclear soon. The de Medicis also sponsored the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, aleading initiate of the secret society network. Da Vinci was able to predictsome of the future development of technology because he knew what most of thepublic were not allowed to know. His famous depiction of the man within thecircle was symbolic of the golden mean geometry on which the major sacred sitesof the world are designed and located.The influence of the Black Nobility expanded northwards into Germany and it isfrom this stream that the British royal family, the House of Windsor,originates. Until they changed their name in 1917, they were called the House ofSaxe-Coburg-Gotha, a German royal line going back to the Black Nobility ofVenice-Lombardy and beyond that to Babylon. The Windsors are reptilianfull-bloods and they know it. When the Black Nobility expanded into Germany, thedel Banco family of Venice became known as the Warburgs. Although they claim tobe Jewish, the Warburgs are in fact a reptile-Aryan bloodline. This explains whythey became bankers to Adolf Hitler and why other reptile-Aryan families likethe Rothschilds claim to be Jewish while funding and supporting people likeHitler. (See …And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background tothis.) In 1998 while on a speaking tour of South Africa, I was invited to have aprivate meeting with P. W. Botha, the President of South Africa during the1980s, who wished to give me information about who controls that country. Hetold me that during his presidency he was asked to host a delegation of theEnglish Rothschilds in Cape Town. At that meeting they told him that money whichonce belonged to German Jews was sitting in Swiss bank accounts and it wasavailable for investment in South Africa if they could agree an interest rate.Botha said he was outraged and refused to play. But this was the money that hasbeen recently located in Swiss banks and was stolen from the Jews who sufferedunder Hitler. The Rothschilds have been lending it and making money from itsince the war. That, my friends, is what the Rothschilds think of Jewish peopleand yet to expose the Rothschilds is to be branded ‘anti-Semitic’ by both Jewishpeople who have no idea how they are being manipulated, and by theself-righteous, self-indulgent ‘Robot Radicals’, better known as the politicalleft. For a definition of how the ‘left’ think and behave, see any definition ofhow the political ‘right’ think and behave! The Rothschilds were formerly knownas the Bauers, one of the most famous occult families of Middle Ages Germany,and they originate not from Israel, but the Caucasus Mountains. They areshape-shifting reptilians hiding behind human form. The Elite Brotherhoodfamilies change their names from time to time to ensure that people won’trealise that the same bloodlines holding the positions of power weave their waythrough history.The Black Nobility made its centre for a time in Amsterdam. Again many of themclaimed to be Jews, but they were not, they were Aryan bloodlines which hadjourneyed there by various routes. Some originated from the Phoenician-Venetiansand some were the Khazar Aryans from the Caucasus Mountains where theirancestors had mass converted to Judaism in the 8th century. What we call Judaismis just another offshoot of the Sun religion of the Aryans, as is Christianity.The leadership in Amsterdam was the successors to the black magicians ofBabylon. They were reptilians operating mostly, but certainly not always, withinthe white race. It was while the Black Nobility had their base in Amsterdam thatthe Dutch people were used to begin the white settlement of South Africa. In1689, one of this Black Nobility, called William of Orange (Ramses-Piso-Bush) ofthe Habsburg bloodline, was manipulated onto the throne of England and at thistime the reptile-Aryan leadership in Amsterdam moved to London to connect withthe other reptile-Aryan bloodlines who had settled in London and Britainthousands of years before. London became even more the epicentre of theirincreasingly global operations. It was after this that British people were usedto settle South Africa and they went to war with the Dutch people there, theBoers, to establish control. Both peoples involved were pawns in a game they didnot understand and their successors still don’t. William of Orange landed inEngland or Barat-land, on the shores of Torbay in 1688, the same place that theTrojan, Brutus, had landed when he came to establish London as his New Troyabout 1,103 BC. Still today there is a statue of William of Orange in thefishing port of Brixham to commemorate his arrival near that spot. William was,of course, a student of the esoteric arts and his physician, Johann Schweitzer,also known as Helvetius, once claimed to have performed alchemy and turned leadinto gold.William of Orange became William III of England as husband of Queen Mary. It wasWilliam’s grotesque treatment of the Irish which led to centuries of bitternessin Ireland which continues to this day. In 1694, William signed the charter forthe Bank of England and the Black Nobility, together with the reptile-Aryanaristocracy already well established in Britain, made the City of London-NewTroy the centre of global finance, a position it still enjoys. Little wonderthat the entrance to the City of London financial centre is marked by statues ofwinged reptiles holding the red cross on a white shield, the ancient Aryan Sunsymbol, and also the symbol of the Rosi Crucis or Sumerian Gra-al, the reptilianbloodlines (more about that later). Other central banks had already been createdby the reptile-Aryan Black Nobility branches. They were the Bank of Amsterdam(1609), Bank of Hamburg (1619) and the Bank of Sweden (1661), but the Bank ofEngland was the jewel. They were designed to lend those governments money thatdid not exist and charge them (the people through taxation) interest on thedebt. The greater the debt the greater the interest and therefore the greaterthe taxation. Get the idea? We’ve been had, my darlin’s, and it’s time to wakeup. Governments, of course, could create their own money interest free and haveno interest to pay to the private banking cartel. The reason they don’tintroduce this most obvious system is because the governments are controlled bythose who control the banks – the Babylonian Brotherhood. And they coordinatebetween their branches in the various countries to ensure that anyone who soughtto do this would be immediately crushed economically and politically. The maincoordinating body between the interconnected central banks is called the Bank ofInternational Settlements, based in the Brotherhood stronghold of Geneva,Switzerland. Just as the reptile Brotherhood control the monarchies because theyare the monarchies, so they have created and controlled all the politicalparties, left, right and centre. The ‘radical’ Liberal Party in Britain, now theLiberal Democrats, used to be known as the Venetian Party and at their highestlevels they are all the reptile-Aryan Party under different guises. Everwondered why politicians appear to differ so much in public and yet introducethe same policies when they get into government? It’s all a conjuring trick onthe human mind.The list of people who arranged for William of Orange to take the British thronereads like a Who’s Who? of the reptile-Aryan-Phoenician Elite. Among the longlist of the Phoenician, sorry, British, aristocracy who subscribed to the Bankof England at its formation (making unbelievable profits) was William Cavendish,the Duke of Devonshire, who also signed the invitation for William to becomeKing. The Cavendish’s are based at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, now a touristattraction, and I felt it to be one of the blackest places I have ever visited.As with all these stately homes of the Brotherhood, goodness knows what has goneon there over the centuries. The Cavendish family crest is a reptile and asnake, whatever its origin it is highly appropriate. The Cavendish’s fused withthe Kennedy family of the United States when Kathleen, the sister of PresidentJohn F. Kennedy, married the heir to the Devonshire fortune. When he died duringWorld War II and she had claim to the Devonshire estates, she ‘conveniently’died in a plane crash. The Kennedy’s are another Elite bloodline which go backto the ancient Irish kings and beyond. The arrival of William of Orange was alsosupported by the reptile-Aryan aristocracy of Scotland where many of thebloodlines based themselves. The Phoenicians were in Scotland thousands of yearsBC, but some of the most famous ‘Scottish’ bloodlines came later from northernFrance and Belgium during the reigns of the Scottish kings, David I and MalcolmIV, between 1124 and 1165. Classic ‘Scottish’ names like Stewart, Seton,Hamilton, Campbell, Douglas, Montgomery, Balliol, Graham, Lindsay, Cameron andComyn, arrived in this period. These ‘Flemish’ people were bloodlines fromSumer, Babylon, Asia Minor and the Caucasus, who had made their way across landto Europe (see Appendix 1). Within 150 years of their arrival in Scotland theywere running the show. One of the most famous of Scottish kings, Robert theBruce, came from the line of Robert of Bruges in what is now Belgium, one of thekey Brotherhood centres today. The battles between the Scots and the Englishwere, although the people never knew, merely battles between different branchesof the same Elite for supremacy in the Agenda. Some were reptile-Aryans, somewere not. Bruce and the St Clairs/Sinclairs were reptilian for sure. It was oneof Bruce’s descendants, the Scottish nobleman James Bruce of Kinnaird, who leftBritain in 1768 for Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, to find a rare copy of the KebraNagast, the sacred book of the Ethiopians, and three copies of the Book of Enochwith which he returned to Europe in 1773. James Bruce was a Freemason, a memberof the Canongate Kilwinning No 2 Lodge in Edinburgh, one of the oldest inScotland.1 [../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos508828] The present Britishroyal family, the Windsors, carry some of the blood of Robert the Bruce and ofthe Scottish, Irish and Welsh Elite, as well as the genetic stream of thereptile-Aryan branches in Germany. The Windsors, like all the royal families(family) of Europe are representatives of the Black Nobility and BabylonianBrotherhood and related to William of Orange. They are, as I shall bedescribing, shape-shifting reptilians.Anna Campbell, Countess of Balcarras and Argyll, was governess to the youngPrince William, and Archibald Campbell, first Duke of Argyll, was alongside himwhen he sailed to England in 1688 to remove the sitting monarch, James II. Adescendant of Anna Campbell was Jenny von Westphalen, who was related to boththe Campbells and the Dukes of Argyll. Jenny von Westphalen was the wife of…Karl Marx, the Brotherhood clone who was used to create Communism. This was oneof the great vehicles used to divide and rule the global population throughfear. Incidentally the reason Marx condemned Jews was because, contrary topopular belief, he wasn’t one. He was of a Brotherhood bloodline which is why hegot the job as frontman for Marxism, a creed compiled not by him but for him(see …And The Truth Shall Set You Free). These interconnecting bloodlines havebeen interbreeding and filling the positions of political and economic powerthroughout the centuries and the genealogy is recorded in the most minutedetail. It is known which lines are more open to possession by the reptiliansand which are not. When a position is to be filled, someone is selected from areptile-Aryan line and if he or she has not already been ‘plugged in’ to thereptilian consciousness via secret society initiations, he or she is invited tojoin the club and away they go.The interconnections and breeding of these bloodlines is simply endless. Themodern Earls of Balcarras are related to Viscount Cowdray (Weetman JohnChurchill Pearson of the London Financial Times family). His mother was thedaughter of Lord Spencer Churchill, the grandfather of Winston Churchill, andhis sister married the Scottish Duke of Atholl. The Argyll-Balcarras linesmanifest as the Lindsays and Campbells. Robert A. Lindsay, the 12th Earl ofBalcarras, became chairman of the National Westminster Bank, one of four majorBritish clearing banks, and director of the Rothschild’s Sun Alliance Assurance.This same Earl was also a British Minister of State for Defence and for Foreignand Commonwealth Affairs. His mother was a Cavendish, who are the Dukes ofDevonshire, headquartered at Chatsworth House. And that’s just one tiny exampleof the way the bloodlines interconnect.[../Images/00033.jpg]Figure 19: The Dragon crest of the Marlborough family at Blenheim Palace.The Marlborough family, one of the most powerful British aristocratic families,also played an important role in putting William of Orange on the Britishthrone. They are related to the Churchills and Winston Churchill was born attheir ancestral home, Blenheim Palace near Oxford, where the gates areemblazoned with the Marlborough family crest, dominated by two reptiles (seeFigure 19). Churchill knew exactly what he was doing when he was the wartimePrime Minister in Britain. The image of him left to us by official history is afarce. He did not save the British Isles from tyranny, he was part of thetyranny to create a war in which all sides were fronted and funded by the samepeople. See …And The Truth Shall Set You Free for proof of this. I could sithere all day detailing the Elite reptile-Aryan families and the way they haveinterbred and interconnected to hold the reins of power in all areas of humanlife over thousands of years. This world has been controlled since antiquity bythe same tribe with their masters operating from the lower fourth dimension.The reptile Agenda has been unfolding over many centuries. It is the long termplan for this tribe, and therefore the reptilians, to take over the planetcompletely. The Agenda has a set timescale and a definite sequence. This isclear by the way each move follows another with breathtaking efficiency underthe supervision of the inner core which operates outside the public arena and,ultimately, from another dimension. For example, in 1665 war broke out betweenthe Dutch and the British and the Great Plague killed 68,000 Londoners andcaused two thirds of the people to leave the city. In 1666, on September 2nd,the Great Fire of London destroyed the city and was blamed, for historicalpurposes, on a baker in Pudding Lane. This happened while the plans were beingarranged for William of Orange to become King of England. When he arrived fromHolland to take the throne, many branches of the Brotherhood bloodlines unitedin London or New Troy to create their operational headquarters. London, thanksto the fire, had created a blank sheet of land on which they could build theirnew financial centre. And who was the main architect of the new London? A highinitiate of the Brotherhood network called Sir Christopher Wren. All acoincidence? Replicas of St Paul’s Cathedral with its massive dome, an ancientritual symbol for the Brotherhood, stand in Paris and Washington DC. One iscalled the Pantheon and the other is the Congress Building on Capitol Hill(named after Capitoline Hill, a sacred hill of the Babylonian Brotherhood inancient Rome). In the years that followed the arrival of William of Orange, camethe so-called Great British Empire. As a kid I always wondered how a few islandswhich you can hardly see on the globe could have an empire that spanned theworld. Now the reason is obvious. It was not the Great British Empire at all. Itwas the empire of the Babylonian Brotherhood which had based itself in Britain,and particularly London. As the ‘British’ Empire expanded into the Americas,Africa, Asia, China, Australia and New Zealand, the Babylonian Brotherhood’scontrol of the world expanded also. Other reptile-Aryan branches in countrieslike Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Germany, occupied other parts ofAfrica; and the Spanish and Portuguese took care of Central and South America.King Leopold II of Belgium, a member of the Windsor reptilian bloodline calledSaxe-Coburg-Gotha, played a major role in the European occupation andexploitation of Africa. The Saxe-Coburg-Gotha line was also prominent inPortugal. Everywhere the reptile-Aryans went they sought to destroy the nativeculture and knowledge. They took out of general circulation the esotericknowledge, memories and understanding of true history. Ancient accounts of thereptilians and the origins of the white race were largely destroyed or withdrawnto secret Brotherhood libraries, not least beneath the Vatican. Christianity wasused as the vehicle for eliminating information that we vitally need to know.It would seem that the contraction of these British and European empires,particularly in this century, indicates that this control has diminished. Notso. It has increased. Overt control, such as a dictatorship you can see, alwayshas a finite life, because in the end there will be a challenge and rebellionagainst it. Covert control, however, control you cannot see, identify or target,can go on forever, because you don’t rebel against something you don’t knowexists. A person who thinks he is free will not complain that he is not. So whathas happened throughout Africa, South America, Asia and the United States andCanada, is that overt control from Britain and Europe has been replaced bycovert control. As these overt empires, particularly the British, have appearedon the surface to contract, they have left in these countries the secret societynetwork, bloodlines and structures to rule just as powerfully as before, but nowwith no danger of a challenge from people with no idea of who is really incontrol. The global structure is quite simple. The central Agenda is coordinatedfrom the City of London, which comprises the financial centre known as the‘Square Mile’, and the land along the River Thames running down to theheadquarters of the British legal profession (Temple Bar), the Houses ofParliament, the centres of government and British Intelligence, and across toBuckingham Palace, the home of the reptilian bloodline known as the Windsors.The British Government is merely a front for the real Agenda that is operatedfrom these few miles of prime real estate in the City of London and the City ofWestminster. Paris is another key centre for the Babylonian Brotherhood and sois the Vatican. Look at the structures of government known laughingly as‘democracy’, the structure of law, economics, the media and all the institutionsyou find in most countries today. Where did the original blueprints for thesestructures come from? London, exactly. We still talk of Britain as the ‘Motherof Parliaments’, for instance. These structures were designed to give theappearance of freedom while allowing almost limitless control by the few behindthe scenes. These are the very structures that the British Empire left behindwhen it apparently withdrew to allow those countries to govern themselves. Likehell they did. Physical occupation was replaced by financial occupation andovert control by covert control.From London, the reptile-Aryan Elite dictates its policy and Agenda to its‘branch managers’, the bloodline families in each country, which ensure that theLondon coordinated Agenda is introduced globally. This is why the same policiesare being imposed in every country I visit. In the United States, the mainbranch managers for London are the Rockefellers who have orchestrated a cartelof families and frontmen like the Morgans, Harrimans, Carnegies, Mellons etc,under the over all supervision of London. In South Africa the bloodline branchmanagers are the Oppenheimers. I spent three weeks travelling, talking andlistening all over South Africa in 1998 and 1999 and it is a wonderful exampleof what I am saying here. Look at the history for a start. First the Dutchsettled the Cape when the Black Nobility were centred in Amsterdam. Then, afterthey moved across the English Channel to London, the British were used as thepawns of occupation. The Dutch East India Company in South Africa was pushedaside by the British East India Company. Explorers of the African interior, likeDoctor David Livingstone, were funded by organisations such as the NationalGeographical Society, controlled from the City of London. Another wave ofreptile-Aryan-British occupation was headed by Cecil Rhodes and his SouthAfrican Company, also a City of London operation. Rhodes was a major Brotherhoodfrontman, especially through a secret society called the Round Table which stillexists today and is exposed at length in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free.Rhodes and his South Africa Company started the diamond and gold mining empirescalled De Beers and Consolidated Goldfields which the Oppenheimers now controlon behalf of the same Brotherhood that funded Rhodes. Another offshoot of theSouth Africa Company was the notorious London-Rhodesia Company called Lonrho,headed most famously by the late Tiny Rowland. Lonrho has manipulated andexploited Africa and its people appallingly, which is in line with the presentday Agenda. Quite clearly, the same group have controlled the African continentunder different companies, people and guises, from the time the first whitesettlers arrived.Before the transfer of power from white minority to black majority under NelsonMandela in South Africa, the Oppenheimer family controlled something like 80 percent of the companies quoted on the South African stock-market and they ownedthe gold, diamond and other mining industries on which the country depends. Theyalso controlled the media through various frontmen. Then came ‘massive change’as Nelson Mandela was released and the blacks were given their ‘freedom’. Now,after this blow for democracy, the Oppenheimers still control something like 80per cent of the companies on the South African stock-market, they own the gold,diamond and other mining industries on which the country depends, and theycontrol the media via frontmen like Henry Kissinger’s friend, Tony O’Reilly, theIrish billionaire. O’Reilly resigned as chairman of the Brotherhood-controlledHeinz corporation and began to buy up newspapers all over the world, moneyapparently no object. So what’s the difference between the Brotherhood’s controlof South Africa before and after the ‘changeover’? One thing and one thing only:no-one is complaining anymore because overt control has been replaced by covertcontrol. When there was a white minority dictatorship the global condemnationcould be heard constantly: “It’s not fair”, the robot radicals would scream,“It’s racism, it’s dictatorship. Outrageous.” And it was. But now the ralliesand the protests have stopped and Mandela is a hero to the world while the samepeople go on controlling South Africa as they did before, although now without aword of protest from the heart-on-the-sleeve, wave-your-banner merchants. Theshanty towns and corrugated iron ghettos are still there in Soweto and in evenmore places these days, but they are not on the daily news anymore becauseeveryone knows that South Africa is now free. The ANC government is just ascontrolled and corrupt as the white one it replaced. Shell Oil, the BabylonianBrotherhood oil company controlled by people like Prince Bernhard of theNetherlands, gave a whole tower block to the ANC at the time of the changeover,and it is, apparently, common knowledge among journalists worth the name, thatMandela took no major decision without consulting the Oppenheimers. In 1993,Mandela spent Christmas at the Nassau holiday home of Tony O’Reilly in theBahamas. In early 1994, O’Reilly bought South Africa’s biggest newspaper group.Oops, could I be questioning a global hero? Slap my wrist. In fact, Mandela isprobably quite a genuine guy who has simply learned the realities of where thereal power lies and he can’t summon the strength or desire to openly challengethe system anymore. But there are many truly corrupt blacks, like Robert Mugabe,the President of Zimbabwe, who are only too willing to take the money and playthe frontman for the Babylonian Brotherhood at the grotesque expense of thepeople. Only in this way can overt control operate behind black faces and thereare reptilian bloodlines among the blacks as well as the whites.The same situation exists throughout the world where you find the samebloodlines and their puppets in charge in country after country, in front of thecamera and behind the scenes. The latter group hold the real power, of course.So if it suits the Agenda to crash the US dollar or the Mexican Peso or bringdown a government, or start a civil war, the branch managers in those countriesgo to work through their financial, media and secret society operations toensure that it happens. In this way, the world can be run by a very few peoplein the City of London and other Brotherhood centres like Paris, Bonn, Brussels,Washington, New York, Switzerland and the Vatican. It’s a simple and brilliantlyorganised structure, ruled from the top with a rod of iron, and no mercy isshown to anyone who does not do exactly as they are told. That’s why it hasworked so efficiently for so long. Add to that the fact that the truth of whatis going on is so bizarre that most people will not believe it and you have theperfect situation for ongoing, unchallenged control.Until now."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_020.html#filepos492138] From The Ashes Of Angels, p 12."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos6369]Knights of the Sun [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos6369]Over thousands of years, the reptilian full-bloods and crossbreeds have createda fantastic web of interconnecting secret societies to enforce their Agenda. Yetthe people in general have been unaware that such a coordinating force has beenat work, manipulating their governments and their lives. In the next threechapters I will show how these networks seized control of the institutions ofroyal, political and religious power, and created the United States. Thisapparent ‘superpower’ is still a puppet of the Babylonian Brotherhood in London.Three of the most significant of the secret societies emerged publicly in the12th century. They are still in existence today and have among their membershiptop people in global politics, banking, business, military and the media. Theywere the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem andthe Teutonic Knights. The Knights Hospitaller have changed their name a numberof times. They have been the Knights of Rhodes and today they are the Knights ofMalta in their ‘Roman Catholic’ form and their ‘Protestant’ version is known asthe Knights of St John of Jerusalem. As the Knights of Malta, their officialhead is the Pope and their headquarters is in Rome. As the Knights of St Johnthey are based in London and their official head is the King or Queen. TheCatholic and Protestant wings are in fact the same organisation at the highestlevel. The Knights Templar were formed about the same time in 1118, though thiscould have been at least four years earlier, and were first known as theSoldiers of Christ. The Templars are surrounded in mystery and contradiction,but it is known that they dedicated the order to the ‘Mother of God’. TheKnights Templar promoted a Christian image as a cover and so Mother of God wastaken to be Mary, the mother of Jesus, but to the reptile-human secret societiesthe term, Mother of God, is symbolic of Isis, the virgin mother of the EgyptianSon of God, Horus, and the wife of the Sun god, Osiris, in Egyptian legend.Isis, in turn, is another name for Queen Semiramis, as inNimrod-Semiramis-Tammuz. Isis/Semiramis is also known by a stream of other namesin the various regions, cultures and countries. These include Barati, Diana,Rhea, Minerva, Aphrodite, Venus, Hecate, Juno, Ceres, Luna and many, manyothers. It is said that they are symbolic of the Moon, the female energy in itsvarious forms. The headquarters of the Grand Mother Lodge of English Freemasonry(Grand Mother = Semiramis/Isis) is based in Great Queen Street in London (GreatQueen = Semiramis/Isis). In the end all the names were inspired by Ninkharsag,the Anunnaki ‘Mother Goddess’ of the reptilian-human crossbreeds, their ‘mammy’.The ancient gods such as Nimrod/Osiris and the endless other names under whichhe is known, represent the power of the Sun, the male, and also represent starsand constellations. Osiris = Orion, Isis = Sirius. This was the knowledge onwhich the Templars were founded and their Phoenician and reptilian inspirationcan be seen in their symbol, the red cross on a white background – the firecross or Sun symbol of the Phoenicians and symbol of the bloodlines. This isalso the flag of England to this day.From the start of the official Templar story there were blatant untruths. Theyclaimed to have been formed to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land, but for thefirst nine years it seems there were only nine of them. Some protection. Itdoesn’t take a genius to see that this was a smokescreen for something else. Infact, it would appear they were formed as the protectors and military wing of asecret society called the Order of Sion, later the Priory of Sion. The word‘Sion’ comes from Siona, the ancient Sanskrit (Aryan) name for… the Sun.1[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588034] Here we go again. Among the laterGrand Masters of the Priory of Sion, according to the book, Holy Blood, HolyGrail, 2 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588253] was Leonardo da Vinci, whowas sponsored by the de Medici banking family (Ramses-Piso-Bush) of the VenetianBlack Nobility. They would also sponsor Christopher Columbus. Among the mostimportant sponsors and supporters of the early Templars was St Bernard, thefounder of the Cistercian Order, and the French St Clair family which became theScottish Sinclair family after they settled in Scotland following the Normaninvasion of Britain by William the Conqueror in 1066. The St Clair/Sinclairs areof a reptilian bloodline and knowledge of the reptilian Agenda was the greatsecret held by the leading Templars. The first Grand Master of the KnightsTemplar was Hughes de Payens, who joined in 1124. He was a French nobleman(meaning literally: Aryan-man) allied to the Count of Champagne, and was marriedto a Scottish woman of Norman decent called Catherine St Clair. The firstTemplar centre or ‘preceptory’ outside the Holy Land was built on the St Clairestate in Scotland. Other early Templars included Fulk, the Count d’Anjou, whowas the father of Geoffrey Plantagenet and the grandfather of the English King,Henry II (all Ramses-Piso-Bush). It was Henry who sponsored the building of thefamous Benedictine Abbey at Glastonbury in the west of England, a sacred sitesince ancient times. The Templars were connected to the Knights Hospitaller(Knights of Malta) at their highest level and these links very much continuetoday. There are many tales of how much they hated each other and there haveundoubtedly been periods of rifts and conflict. But at their peak they aredifferent branches of the same organisation and at that level the Agenda is allimportant. In June 1099, another glorious blow was struck for the ‘Lord’ whenChristian crusaders invaded Jerusalem and slaughtered the Saracen Muslim Turksand the Judeans living there. This reopened the ‘Holy City’ to Christianpilgrims who began to arrive in large numbers through the ports of Jaffa, Tyreand Acre. Tyre was one of the major centres for the Phoenicians. The KnightsHospitaller established the Amalfi Hostelry in Jerusalem to provide food andshelter for the visitors. As their wealth and prestige grew, they formed amilitary wing, which was given papal backing in 1118, the same year that theoriginal nine Knights Templar arrived in Jerusalem to ‘guard’ the pilgrims.The Templars were given quarters adjoining Temple Mount, the alleged, and Istress alleged, site of Solomon’s Temple. Some researchers believe the Templarsfound something of great value, possibly manuscripts, possibly vast amounts ofgold, while excavating under Temple Mount. But whatever happened events began tomove rapidly after 1126, for it was then that the Grand Master, Hugues dePayens, left Jerusalem to gather recruits and expand the order. He headed backto France to meet St Bernard, then Abbot of Clairvaux, and he took with himBernard’s Templar uncle, Andre de Montbard. Bernard sang their praises to PopeHonarius II, and the Templars were formally established on January 31st 1128 atthe Council of Troyes. Yes, named after Troy, that great Aryan and reptile-Aryanheadquarters in Asia Minor which also inspired the original name of London. TheTemplars were part of the same gang, although many of the lower initiates wouldnot have known this. Among their symbols, apart from the Phoenician red cross,were a black and white flag (made up of two squares), the skull and crossbones,and the watchtower. All of these symbols have spanned the centuries to thepresent day Brotherhood organisations. The black and white squares can be foundon the floor of every Freemason Temple, because the Freemasons are the Templarsunder another name. Many churches and cathedrals, like Westminster Abbey andNotre Dame in Paris, also have black and white squares on the floor, because theChristian church is a front for the Babylonian Brotherhood. Many police forces,including those in the UK and the USA, have black and white squares on theiruniform because they are controlled by the Freemasons and the Templars. Theskull and bones is symbolic, in part, of the black magic rituals the Brotherhoodhave employed since their very earliest days and these same sickening rituals,often involving human sacrifice, are still going on today. If you look at theVatican or papal crest, you will see that the dome of St Peter’s Basilica andthe crossed keys of Peter also form the same skull and crossbones. They’re allin it together. This theme could well be the reason that the Piso family in theGospel stories said the location of the ‘crucifixion’ of Jesus, was a placecalled Golgotha, meaning: the place of the skull. Another Babylonian Brotherhoodorganisation is the appropriately named Skull and Bones Society based across theroad from the campus of Yale University at New Haven in Connecticut, USA. It isa blood drinking, Satanic secret society for the bloodline families and its mostfamous current member is George Bush, the former President of the United Statesand a shape-shifting reptilian related to a stream of names throughout thisbook. So too, of course, is George W. Bush, his son. Father George is also oneof the foremost drug runners in America, and a Satanist, child abuser and serialkiller. See a later chapter for details of this. The Watchtower symbol can beseen in the Jehovah’s Witness organisation because this is also a Brotherhoodfront that is conning countless followers into believing it is Christian. One ofits founders was Charles Taze Russell, a high degree Freemason, who is buriedunder a pyramid.Only a year after the Templars were formally established at the Council ofTroyes, incredible expansion had taken place. They had a papal constitution,wealth, land and three hundred recruits from noble families who had to give alltheir wealth to the Templars when they joined. As a result they owned land inFrance, England, Scotland, Spain and Portugal, and within ten years this wasextended to Italy, Austria, Germany, Hungary and Constantinople. There wereTemplar preceptories and villages, hamlets and farms galore all over England.Whenever you see the name Temple in a British place name (for instanceTemplecombe) it is a former Templar site. Their national headquarters was inLondon on land which is now High Holborn and in 1161 they moved a short distanceto a new London temple which is still today called Temple Bar. Here can be foundthe original church in the classic round design of the Templars, along with someTemplar graves. In a most prominent position in Temple Bar, in the centre of themain thoroughfare, is a statue of a winged reptile. The Templar holdingsincluded the Strand and much of Fleet Street which, until recently, was the homeof the British national newspaper industry. The symbol of the national tabloid,The Daily Express, once headquartered in Fleet Street, is a knight carrying ashield emblazoned with the Templar-Phoenician red cross on a white background.The Templar lands stretched down to the River Thames where the Templars hadtheir own docks. During the reign of Queen Victoria, the Brotherhood erected anobelisk alongside the Thames at this point and placed a sphinx on either side.The obelisk had formerly stood in the Egyptian city of On or Heliopolis (theCity or Place of the Sun) and it is known today as Cleopatra’s Needle (seepicture section). This obelisk is an ancient Egyptian-Aryan symbol of the Sun,the male energy, the phallus. These symbols are to be found in many places,often under the guise of war memorials and have been placed there by Freemasonicmanipulation. Has anyone ever asked themselves why a war memorial nearly alwayshas to be an obelisk? And why do you think the Washington monument in the centreof Washington DC is a giant obelisk? Because obelisks, like all these symbolsand geometrical shapes, generate the energy they represent. I remember climbingsome stone steps inside a big obelisk near Hebden Bridge in England and feelingenormous male sexual energy all around me. I wondered what on Earth washappening until I remembered where I was… inside a male penis in effect. What asymbol is built to represent is the energy it will generate, because symbols area physical manifestation of the thoughts which create them. These guys don’t puttheir symbols everywhere just for fun. They do it because it helps to resonatethe energy field to the vibrational frequency they want. In turn, this affectsthe thoughts and feelings of the people.Most notably today, the Templar lands of London are the home of the Britishlegal profession. Barristers qualify when they ‘come to the Bar’ – Temple Bar –and they join either the Inner Temple, Middle Temple or Outer Temple. I havespoken with people who have had experience of these organisations and they foundthem to be very sinister indeed. For sure, they are. If you want to control thepeople you have to control the law and who is and isn’t prosecuted. Thus youhave the police awash with members of the Freemasons along with the legalprofession and the judges. These Templar lands of all those centuries ago are inthe heart of that area of London from the City of London ‘square mile’ financialdistrict down to the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. This is theland from which the world is currently controlled, at least at the operationallevel, together with Paris and the Vatican. And Paris was the otherdual-headquarters for the Knights Templar. That city also has a 3,200 year oldEgyptian obelisk at a key point in its street plan, the Place de la Concorde.Princess Diana passed that obelisk in the Mercedes literally a minute before itcrashed in the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in 1997.By the middle of the 12th century the Templars were second only to the RomanChurch for wealth and influence. They had their own fleet of ships (on whichthey flew the skull and bones flag), and their financial centres in London andParis were, in effect, the start of the modern banking system which has madehumanity slaves to non-existent ‘money’. They, too, lent ‘money’ that didn’texist and charged interest on it in true Babylonian Brotherhood style. Onedocumented case shows the Templars charging 60 per cent interest on the latepayment of a debt. One of the plans promoted by the Templars was the creation ofa United States of Europe and under different guises and fronts their masters inthe Brotherhood have achieved just that. The creation of the European Union withits single central bank and currency is one of the pillars of the BrotherhoodAgenda.Some of the advanced knowledge inherited by the Templars was that of the Earth’senergy grid, the network of magnetic force lines known as ley lines, dragonlines or meridians. The major sacred sites are where many of these lines cross,creating enormous vortices of energy. If you perform a black magic ritual andhuman sacrifice at these points the deeply negative energy it produces iscarried on the force lines emanating from the vortex and pumped throughout thenetwork. This affects the vibrational state of the Earth’s magnetic energy fieldwithin which we all live. If that energy field is full of fear, people will bemore likely to feel that emotion. And fear is the four letter word that controlsthe world. The most important weapon for the Babylonian Brotherhood since itscreation has been the manipulation of fear. Nothing limits people’s potential toexpress their true selves more than fear. It becomes understandable, therefore,why so many Christian churches were built on ancient Pagan sites and why so manySatanic rituals are performed in churches under the cover of darkness. It wasthe Templars, with their knowledge of the esoteric arts, who financed the greatGothic cathedrals of Europe between 1130 and 1250. The Gothic style can be shownto have originated with the Aryan race in the Middle-Near East. The Gothiccathedrals which were funded and designed by the Templars included WestminsterAbbey, York Minster in northern England, Chartres in France not far from Paris,and Notre Dame in Paris itself. Notre Dame (Our Lady: Isis/Semiramis/Ninkharsag)was built on a site dedicated to the goddess Diana, and Chartres was placed onan ancient sacred site which once attracted Druids from all over Europe. Thefamous chapel of Kings College, Cambridge which was based upon the cabalisticTree of Life symbol, was described as one of the last great Gothic structuresbuilt in Britain.3 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588452] Its design wasapparently inspired by the 14th century cathedral at Albi in the Languedoc insouthern France, one of the primary centres for both the Templars and theCathars. In the 12th and 13th centuries the Cathar religion, which challengedmany beliefs of the Roman Church and contained much esoteric knowledge, was thedominant faith in much of southern France. This sent the alarm bells ringing inthe Babylonian Brotherhood in Rome and the puppet Pope, Innocent III, destroyedthe Cathars in an unspeakable ‘crusade’ of torture and burning, which culminatedin the siege of the Cathar castle at Montsegur in 1244. Incidentally, the use ofreptile figures called gargoyles became widespread on ‘Christian’ churches andcathedrals. Notre Dame in Paris is covered in them (see picture section) andmany are smaller representations of the same reptile depictions you find on andaround the Mayan pyramids and sites in Mexico. The Mexican President, Miguel DeLa Madrid, said that the Maya had been interbred with the ‘Iguana race’ –reptilians.Both Chartres and Notre Dame were centres of Black Madonna worship, anotherTemplar obsession. The Black Madonna cult was not related to Mary, mother ofJesus, although that was the impression they wanted people to have. It was theworship of Queen Semiramis and Isis/Barati. The Egyptians portrayed Isis inwhite in her positive mode and in black in her negative form. The Black Madonnawas the Black Isis/Barati and more directly, Queen Semiramis who was known inBabylon as the Madonna. The Black Madonna symbolises the negative use of female‘Moon’ energy, while the Black Sun symbolises the negative use of solar energy,the male, besides being an occult name for the galactic Sun which this solarsystem orbits. For instance, the white horse was a Sun symbol of the Phoeniciansand so the black horse under the Brotherhood’s system of reverse symbolism,represents the malevolent use of the Sun energy. The black horse is the symbolof the Brotherhood front in the United Kingdom, Lloyds Bank. The statues of Maryholding the baby Jesus in the Christian churches are mirrors of the way theEgyptians portrayed Isis holding the baby, Horus. St Bernard was clearly acovert disciple of the goddess religion and was born at Fontaines near Dijon, acentre for Black Madonna worship. The Templars shared his passion and they builttheir own churches in a circular shape, indicating the feminine. The widespreaduse of the dome or ‘womb’ by the Brotherhood also relates to this, among otherthings.The New Age belief system has often fallen into the trap of believing thatfemale energy is good and male energy not so good, because they think the worldis male-dominated. In fact the world is dominated by the extremes of bothenergies, male and female. I am not talking about male and female bodies here,but male and female energy which both men and women have the potential tomanifest. When a male suppresses his female polarity he becomes ‘macho man’ andthinks the only way to be a ‘real man’ is to be dominant and aggressive. Thisextreme of male energy is reflected by soldiers with guns and overt, in yourface, aggression and power. Thus we think the world is male-dominated becauseyou can see the extremes of male energy on the news every night. That’s thepoint, you can see it. The negative extreme of female energy, however, is behindthe scenes manipulation, covertly setting up the events and conflicts which theextreme of the male energy can play out in public. In other words, you can’t seeit. This is the energy that the agents of the Babylonian Brotherhood work withand they symbolise this with names like Semiramis, Isis and all the rest. Theyalso know that the female energy is the creative force, which brought forth eventhe Sun, as the Egyptians used to say of Isis. This female force, like allenergy, is neutral. You can create something positive or something malevolent,but to do either you need to harness the female, the creative force. Hence youhave the constant female symbolism by the Brotherhood in all its forms. It isthe balanced, positive expression of the female energy that they have sought tosuppress, not the female energy itself.The Gothic cathedrals and Christian churches are full of Sun, astrological,goddess and sexual symbolism. The great Gothic doorways and the ridges aroundthem are depictions of the vulva and many even have a clitoris symbol at the topof the arch. The same is depicted in windows and especially the rose windows ofthe Gothic cathedrals which face west, the sacred direction of female deities.Carvings on other medieval churches have been found which portray monks andpriests having sex with young girls and wearing animal heads. This is what theSatanists still do today. The Sheela-na-gig symbols in old churches,particularly prevalent in Ireland, represent naked women with spread legs andinside the alters of churches have been found stone phallic symbols. Mygoodness, what will the vicar think? The often shell-like receptacle for the‘holy water’ is goddess symbolism also, and churches were actually built as asymbolic womb. The spider’s web and maze decorations of the Gothic and othercathedrals and churches refer to the female ‘goddess’ energy, the intuitive,creative force, which weaves and spins the fate of the world. This is also thesymbolism of the Spider Woman legends of the Native American traditions and thenames of sacred places like Spider Rock in Arizona. A book by Fred Gettings, TheSecret Zodiac (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1987), features the zodiac mosaic inthe marble floor of the Gothic church of San Miniato in Florence, Italy, whichdates from 1207. Gettings suggests that the church was built to align with arare conjunction of Mercury, Venus and Saturn in the sign of Taurus at the endof May that year. Astrology, which can be traced back to the beginning of knownhistory, was a very important art to the Templars and was taught in the schoolat Chartres. When Christians go to church they have no idea that they areentering a ‘Pagan’ shrine, but that’s exactly what they are doing.The Templars had close relationships with most of the monarchs of the time,although less so in France. Given their immense wealth, the Templars ‘owned’many of the kings who appeared to be in power, just as their Brotherhoodsuccessors own the governments of today. The Templars were close to Henry II ofEngland (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the sponsor of Glastonbury. How interesting thatHenry’s famous feud with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas à Becket, endedwhen two knights arrived from France to murder him in Canterbury Cathedral in1170. Henry’s son Richard the Lionheart (Ramses-Piso-Bush) was, in effect, aTemplar himself, though not officially. He used their ships and preceptories andwhen he was forced to escape from England and the threats of his brother, John,he did so disguised as a Templar. He was protected by them and headed for theHoly Land crusades against the Muslim Saracens. Richard sold Cyprus (a formerPhoenician settlement) to the Templars and he was involved in negotiationsbetween them and their Islamic version, the secret society called the Assassins.This word is now used to describe a killer and it derives from the Assassinsparticular method of ruling by fear and terrorism. Assassin is said to mean‘user of hashish’ because they used the drug to trick and manipulate young meninto killing for ‘God’ in the belief that this would secure their place inparadise. The name could also originate from the words hass (to destroy) andasana (to lay snares). They waged an international terrorist war from theirmountain headquarters at Alamut or Eagles Nest in Persia (Asia Minor/Turkey).Pottery decorated with pentagrams and the symbol of the female vulva have beenfound at this site and the Assassins wore white tunics with a red sash. TheAssassins, who still continue today under different fronts, emerged from a sectfounded by a Persian called Hassan Sabah (another very possible origin of thename) in 1090, the same period the Templars, Knights Hospitaller, and theTeutonic Knights were being formed.The Templars and the Assassins worked together although they appeared to be ondifferent sides. This is the way the public are still duped today into believingthat because two groups war or oppose each other in public they must be ondifferent sides. If you want to control the outcome of a game, you have tocontrol both sides, but to get away with this you must kid the people that thetwo sides have different masters and goals. One of the most effective methods ofmanipulation by the Brotherhood is to create or infiltrate all sides and socontrol the outcome. The Templars were skilled in this. While they wereescorting Richard the Lionheart to the Crusades, they were supporting hisbrother and fierce rival, King John (Ramses-Piso-Bush). The Templars were behindthe signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, thanks to the efforts of Aymeric de StMaur, the Templar’s Grand Master in England and King John’s closest advisor. TheMagna Carta curtailed many powers of the monarchy, so increasing the Templarscontrol and leading further down the road to the Agenda’s long term goal tointroduce ‘democracy’: imprisonment disguised as freedom. Covert control insteadof overt control. I am not saying that all the Templars were of negative intent.I’m sure that’s not the case. But as always in these secret societies there weremany levels of knowledge and agendas. The French writer and researcher, JeanRobin, concluded that the Order of the Temple consisted of seven outer circleswhich were taught the ‘minor’ mysteries and three inner circles which workedwith the ‘great’ mysteries. It is the same with Freemasonry and all secretsocieties today. The mass of the membership has no idea what their top levelsknow or the Agenda they are promoting.Despite their wealth, the Templars were exempt from taxes (just like thetax-exempt foundations of the Brotherhood today) and they had their own courts.They controlled monarchs, people of influence, businesses and countries. Theirmethod was to manipulate their ‘targets’ into a position of dependency, usuallythrough blackmail or debt. In this way the Templars could then dictate theiractions. Nothing changes. Edward I borrowed substantial sums from the Templarswhile King John and Henry III were up to their necks in debt to them. All threewere the Ramses-Piso-Bush bloodline. At one point, Henry pawned the Crown Jewelsto the Templars to pay for military exploits. This is another ancient techniqueof the Babylonian Brotherhood still constantly used today. Manipulate wars, lendall sides the money to fight them, and pick up massive profits from the horrorsyou have secretly caused. You also lend the same countries money to rebuildtheir shattered societies and this makes them even more in your debt and furtherunder your control. You can also use the war to remove leaders, take over lands,and redraw the boundaries in line with your Agenda. Look at the two world warsin the 20th century to see how it is done. This is explained in detail in …AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free. The English Crown Jewels at the time of King Johnwere kept at the Templar’s London Temple and under John, Henry II, Henry III andEdward I, it was also one of four royal treasuries. The Templars collected thetaxes for the Pope and the Crown, plus the taxation known as tithes. They were aprivate organisation with a secret agenda, collecting taxes from the people onbehalf of others and a great slice of that money went straight to themselves inpayment for interest on loans. Apparently they were ruthless with non-payers.Today these are still the methods used throughout the world. The Templar vows ofsobriety and chastity were often so much hypocrisy. One description for heavydrinking in medieval England was to ‘drink like a Templar’. When it came to theserious business of money, however, they were as ruthless with their own as theywere with the populace. It is the same today when members of the Brotherhood andtheir lackeys step out of line. In France, the Templar centre in Paris was theleading royal treasury and the French monarchy was also in serious debt to them.But the French king, Philippe IV, or Philippe the Fair, decided, it seems, thathe’d had enough and took steps to destroy the Templars in a purge against themin October 1307. Or at least that’s the official story. There is a great dealmore to know before we can understand what really happened and its relevance tothe world events which followed. I will summarise some of the background.The Merovingian bloodlineFrom their creation, the Templars and the Order of Sion, later Priory of Sion,were two branches of the same organisation. The role of the Priory of Sion,claimed by the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, is to protect a ‘royal’ bloodlinecalled the Merovingians (Ramses-Piso-Bush). As such, all of the Grand Masters Iname, like Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton, must be of this same bloodline.But there are so many smokescreens in this story to obscure the truth. One ofthese is the claim that the Merovingians are the bloodline of Jesus, via thechild or children he conceived with Mary Magdalene, who fled with them to theSouth of France after the ‘Crucifixion’. But there was no Jesus and no Marybecause these are symbolic figures in a story which has been told endless timesthroughout the pre-Christian world, using different names. I find it hard tocomprehend, therefore, how two symbolic people could conceive a bloodline thatbecame the Merovingians. It’s baloney and this tale has been hatched to divertresearchers from the truth. Yes, the truth is about bloodlines and theMerovingians are a major one. But no, it has nothing whatsoever to do withJesus. This particular line, going back to Alexander the Great and beyond,became known as the Merovingians in France by the 5th and 6th centuries. We areindebted for the early history of these people to Fredegar’s Chronicle, a copyof which exists in the National Library in Paris. Fredegar was a 7th centuryscribe from Burgundy and he worked for 35 years to complete his record of theearly Franks and Merovingians. A tribe called the Sicambrian Franks, from whomwe get France, was another link in the Aryan and reptile-Aryan ‘vine’. TheFranks were named after their leader, Francio, who died in 11 BC. Francio’speople migrated from Troy in what is now Turkey and became the Scythians andeventually the Sicambrian Franks, named after their tribal queen, Cambra, in thelate fourth century. They originated in Scythia, north of the Black Sea in theCaucasus Mountains, from where the Aryan and reptile-Aryan race swept acrossEurope. The Sicambrian Franks called themselves the Newmage – the People of theCovenant; that is the covenant of the Anunnaki.The Sicambrian Franks later lived in an area west of the River Danube andsettled in Germania (named by the Romans after the Scythian ‘genuine ones’) andtheir centre was Cologne. It was from the time of King Meroveus(Ramses-Piso-Bush), who was named Guardian of the Franks in 448, that this linebecame known as the Merovingians. These were the sorcerer kings who were notedfor their esoteric knowledge and magical powers which they inherited from theunderground bloodline streams of secret groups and initiations. Francio, thefounder of the Franks, claimed to be a descendant of Noah and his ancestors onceresided in ancient Troy. I think myself that the story of Noah is symbolic ofthe reptilian crossbreed bloodlines which survived the flood and afterwardsreturned the dove and the olive branch (Semiramis-Nimrod) to power. Decendentsof Noah = human-reptilian crossbreeds, or at least those who have interbredenough to maintain that genetic structure. The French city of Troyes, where theTemplars were officially formed, was named by the Sicambrian Franks after theirformer home. The City of Paris was established by them in the 6th century afterthey became known as the Merovingians and it was named after Prince Paris, theson of King Priam of Troy. It was the relationship between Prince Paris andHelen of Sparta which supposedly caused the Trojan War in which the Trojan Horseinfiltration assured victory for the Spartans. Both the Trojans and the Spartanswere offshoots of the same Aryan and reptile-Aryan peoples. The Merovingiansestablished the city of Paris on a major vortex point and used an undergroundchamber there for their rituals, including human sacrifice to the goddess Diana.Here, kings in dispute over property would settle the issue in combat. Meroveus,the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, followed the Pagan goddess cult ofDiana, another symbol for Isis/Semiramis. This is not surprising because thecentre for Diana worship was at Ephesus in Asia Minor, not far from the allegedsite of Troy. The location of the ancient underground chamber in Paris where theMerovingians worshipped and sacrificed to the goddess Diana is now called thePont and Place de L’Alma and it is still, by design, an underground chamber. Onthe site today is a road tunnel and it was here that the car of Diana, Princessof Wales, crashed in the early morning of Sunday, August 31st 1997. Anotheroffshoot of the Scythian-Sicambrian Franks-Merovingian bloodline(Ramses-Piso-Bush) emigrated from northern France and Belgium in the 12thcentury to become the famous ‘Scottish’ families and some of these were theancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales.The Merovingian king, Clovis (Ramses-Piso-Bush), had the iris, or fleur-de-lis,as his royal emblem, a flower which grows wild in the Middle East. It is alsoknown as a three-pronged lily and it was used to symbolise Nimrod or rather thereptilian bloodline of Nimrod. In Latin it means small sword and it became thesymbol of the royal bloodline of what is now France and this was because inancient Sumer the reptilian bloodline, as passed on through the female, wassymbolised by a lily. Hence the main reptilian gene carriers were given nameslike Lilith, Lili, Lilutu and Lillette. Another version is Lilibet or Elizabethand this is why the present British Queen is called Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth)and was known to her family circle as Lilibet. She is a major reptilian genecarrier who produced a major reptilian full-blood called Prince Charles. Bothare shape-shifting reptilians, a fact that will be supported by later evidence.So is the Queen Mother, formerly Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth) Bowes-Lyon. Thefleur-de-lis is an ancient symbol and also represents the twin phallic pillarsof Jachin and Boaz in the symbolic Solomon’s Temple, which were carved with‘lilywork’, as described in Kings 7:22. Today you will see the fleur-de-lis usedprofusely on the regalia of British royalty, on official buildings and thefencing around them, and in churches. It is, appropriately, on a public gate tothe White House in Washington, another home of the bloodlines. The three-leafedshamrock in Ireland is likewise an ancient symbol of the bloodline and the wordshamrock comes from the North African term: shamrukh. All these symbols relateto the three horned depiction of Nimrod in Babylon and to other esotericprinciples. Other Merovingian symbols were the fish (Nimrod again), the lion(Leo, the Sun, authority), and the bee. Three hundred golden bees were found onthe burial cloak of King Childeric I (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the son of Meroveus,who died in the 5th century. Bees are an ancient symbol of the Love Goddess(Semiramis) and symbolised royalty in Egypt. They also focus on the Queen Bee,symbolic of Isis/Semiramis.The Merovingians were another name for a Babylonian Brotherhood bloodline andthe idea that they are from the bloodline of Jesus is a play on words, or,rather, a play on deities, by the Priory of Sion. Jesus is another name forNimrod/Tammuz, the father-son of Babylon. Therefore, I would suggest, thebloodline of ‘Jesus’ is really the bloodline of the ‘Nimrod’ Brotherhood, thereptile-Aryans. Also, the Priory of Sion say they are dedicated to restoring theMerovingian line to the throne of France. They never were the monarchy ofFrance, because it didn’t exist at that time. It’s all nonsense and designed tohide the real Agenda of the Priory of Sion which is a Babylonian Brotherhoodfront. What all these diversions obscure is a simple and devastating truth. The‘Grant of Arms’ or symbol of the Dragon bloodine in Sumer was called a Gra-al,also known as the Mark of Cain. The biblical Cain was one of the earlyAnunnaki-human royal crossbreeds who followed ‘Adam’. It is this Gra-al thatbecame the so-called Holy Grail and this is why its equvilant in Old Frenchmeans ‘blood royal’. The Grant of Arms emblem in Sumer was… a cup of waters or aRosi-Crucis or ‘Dew Cup’. It is described in Egyptian, Sumerian, Phoenician andHebrew records as a cup decorated with a red cross within a circle. This is thetrue origin of the ‘grail cup’. It wasn’t the cup that caught the blood of Jesusat the crucifixion because there was no Jesus or crucifixion. It was the cupthat symbolised the womb and the bloodline of the most ‘pure’ of the reptiliancrossbreeds which is passed on most crucially through the female. The termRosi-Crucis was also the origin, quite obviously, of the Rosicrucians, anancient secret society which has schemed and manipulated to ensure the reptilianbloodlines continue to occupy the positions of power. One of the authors who isselling the idea that the bloodline relates to Jesus is Sir Laurence Gardner, ‘asovereign and chivalric genealogist’. Funny that, because he must know this isnot true. Sir Laurence is Chancellor of the Imperial and Royal Court of theDragon Sovereignty, the former Royal Court of the Dragon in Egypt. He is alsoPrior of the Celtic Church of the Sacred Kindred of Saint Columba (Semiramis);Presidential Attaché to the European Council of Princes; formerly attached tothe Noble Household Guard of the Royal House of Stewart (Stuart, the MerovingianRamses-Piso-Bush line); he is known as Le Chevalier Labhran de Saint Germain,and is Preceptor of the Knights Templars of Saint Anthony. I think it’s fair tocall him an insider. So why does he keep telling us the Holy Grail bloodline isabout Jesus when, with that background, he must know that it isn’t?Eventually the Roman Church withdrew its support for the Merovingians and theylost their power and faded from the public scene until the last few years.Another bloodline monarch from the reptilian ‘stable’ became King of the Franks.His name was Charles, better known as Charlemagne (Ramses-Piso-Bush), one of themost celebrated monarchs in the history of Europe. He was an early patron of thestone masons who later built the Gothic cathedrals of Europe for the Templars.In Toulouse he is said to have founded a lodge of the Rosicrucian Order, whichhas its origins at least as far back as ancient Egypt,4[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588607] and relates, as stated, to theRosi-Crusis, the symbol of the reptilian bloodlines. Charlemagne vastly extendedthe Frankish empire and in 800 he was installed as Emperor of the West in thepapal empire of Pope Leo III. The Church of Rome/Babylon controlled much ofwestern and central Europe. This domination was completed when the militaryopposition to Rome, the Hohenstaufens or Ghibellines, were defeated by theGuelphs, named after Welf, the Duke of Bavaria, in 1268. This led to thecreation of the Holy Roman Empire, an horrendous papal dictatorship. Its mostprominent dynasty of Emperors were the Habsburgs (Ramses-Piso-Bush), a bloodlinefamily first noted in Switzerland during the 10th century. They emerged withpapal support to govern the Holy Roman Empire for five hundred years until itsdemise in 1806. They ruled Austria from 1278 and in the 16th century theyinherited the crown of Spain. The Habsburgs are a reptilian bloodline and I knowa high priestess who has officiated at top Satanic rituals and who has seen themodern Habsburgs at rituals shape-shift into reptilians. A lot more from herlater. Charlemagne was a wonderful servant of the Babylonian Brotherhood and hisbloodline has continued to hold the reins of power. At least 33 Americanpresidents are genetically related to him, probably all of them.The Rennes-le-Chateau mysteryThe Merovingians returned to public attention more recently in a number of booksseeking to solve the mystery of the tiny mountain top hamlet in the Languedoc insouthern France called Rennes-le-Chateau. This was once one of the mostimportant centres for the Priory of Sion, the Templars, the Cathars and manyothers in the ‘knowledge’ stream. The area was once peopled by the Celts, theformer Cimmerians and Scythians, from the Near East and the Caucasus Mountains,and Rennes-le-Chateau was called Rhedae after one of their tribes. It wasworshipped as a sacred place by the Druids because again this is a region ofimmense magnetic power. In the late 1960s a document of uncertain backgroundcalled the Red Serpent or Le Serpent Rouge came to light in the National Libraryin Paris. It contained the genealogy of the Merovingians, two maps of France inthe Merovingian period, and a ground plan of St Sulpice, the Roman Catholiccentre for occult studies in Paris.5[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588719] St Sulpice was built on the ruinsof a temple to Isis/Semiramis and was a burial ground for Merovingian kings. LeSerpent Rouge was dated January 17th 1967, and the deposit slip at the NationalLibrary was dated February 15th.6 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos588906]The latter turned out to be a forgery, however, and the real date it wasdeposited was March 20th.7 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589081] By thistime all the alleged authors of the work, Pierre Feugere, Louis Saint-Maxent andGaston de Koker, had died within 24 hours of each other on March 6–7.8[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589164] But it gets even stranger becausethese three, it emerges, were not the authors at all.9[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589247] Someone, it is thought, had usedthe names of these three dead men as the authors to add more mystery to thetale. There were 13 days between the three deaths and the deposit of thedocument at the library. The 13 page document included short prose poemscorresponding to each sign of the zodiac and it listed 13 signs. It called theextra one, Ophiuchus (the Serpent Holder), which it placed between Scorpio andSagittarius. The most important number to the Templars was 13 and this willbecome more and more relevant as the story unfolds. I have long believed therewere originally 13 signs to the zodiac. The text of Le Serpent Rouge, whichappears to mention the landscape around Rennes-le-Chateau, presents a version ofthe Sleeping Beauty story in which the princess (female energy) is condemned tosleep until the handsome prince arrives to awaken her. This is also highlyrelevant to the number 13 for reasons I will later outline. Le Serpent Rougeconfirmed that Mary Magdalene was another symbol for Isis. It said:“…Formerly some called her ISIS, queen of the beneficent sources, COME TO ME ALLYOU SUFFER AND WHO ARE OVERWHELMED AND I WILL COMFORT YOU, others: MAGDALENE, ofthe famous vase full of healing balm. The initiates know her true name: NOTREDAME DES CROSS.”10 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589330]The female energy and the reptilian bloodline are passed on through the female,and since the intervention of Ninkharsag and Enki this energy was symbolised byMary, Isis and Semiramis, and was also known as Diana. Princess Diana was killedon an ancient Merovingian sacrificial site to the goddess Diana when her carstruck the 13th pillar. A cave at Sainte-Baume in southern France is an officialCatholic shrine because, it is said quite wrongly, Mary Magdalene lived there.11[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589420] In fact, during Roman times thatcave was a centre for the worship of the goddess Diana Lucifera – Diana thelight bringer or Illuminatrix. This was the very name given to Mary Magdalene byJacobus de Voragine, the Dominican Archbishop of Black Nobility Genoa.12[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589510] One other interesting point is thatwhile Templars throughout France were arrested and tortured after the purge byPhillipe the Fair in 1307, the ones in the Rennes-le-Chateau area at Le Bezu, leValdieu and Blanchefort, were left alone. This area was quite obviously veryimportant to the Templars and they were connected with the Blanchefort family atChateau de Blanchefort, just two miles from Rennes-le-Chateau. Some researchersbelieve that the Templars buried much of their gold near Rennes-le-Chateau.Certainly a third of all their European property was once to be found in theLanguedoc region. The Romans, too, thought this area to be sacred and worshippedtheir Pagan gods here. By the 6th century, Rennes-le-Chateau was a thriving townof 30,000 people, the northern capital of the Visigoth empire which spread southacross the Pyrenees into Spain. The Visigoths were a Germanic or Teutonicpeople, the same as the later Teutonic Knights who emerged at the same time asthe Templars. The Visigoths were again the descendents of the Cimmerians and theScythians, the white peoples from the Caucasus. It was the Visigoths who sweptout of central Europe to sack Rome and bring an end to Roman rule.An ancient Visigoth chateau, the Chateau d’Hautpoul, still survives atRennes-le-Chateau and it has an alchemist’s tower. Alchemy is the transformationof base man/woman into pure spirit, but it has another meaning too, thetransformation of base metals into gold. The theory of this was summed up by theancient Greek initiate, Aristotle, who taught Alexander the Great. Aristotle wasone of the world’s most famous philosophers. He was taught by Plato, who in turnwas taught by Socrates. Aristotle said that the basis of the physical world waswhat he called prime or first matter. This, he said, was a non-physical energywhich you could not see or touch. He believed that prime matter could manifestas physical form through the four elements of Earth, Fire, Water and Air. Theseelements are different from each other, but each is connected by a common bondof dryness, moisture, heat or cold. Every element has two of these qualities,one of which dominates. Earth is cold and dry and dryness predominates. Fire ishot and dry and heat predominates. Water is moist and cold and coldpredominates. Air is hot and moist and moistness predominates. The idea is thatone element can be transformed into another through the bond they have incommon, eg Fire becomes air through the common bond of heat. Substances are madefrom the elements and if you can transform the elements into each other, youmust be able to transform the substances the elements are made from. Forinstance, lead can be changed into gold. There is, it is believed, a secretpowder which is necessary for this transformation and it has become known as thePhilosopher’s Stone. The d’Hautpoul family are said to have been holders of suchsecrets. The document, Le Serpent Rouge, when speaking of the 13th sign of thezodiac, Ophiuchus, says: “the base lead of my words may contain the purestgold”.13 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589594] This could well relate tothe properties of the mono-atomic gold I mentioned earlier. For five hundredyears, Rennes-le-Chateau was owned by the Count of Razes and became an importantcentre for the Cathars. With their demise its power waned. A plague and Catalanbandits completed its fall from a major town to the tiny hamlet it was tobecome.14 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589694] Today it is a place ofgreat beauty and mystery with views across the mountains and valleys. I woulddefinitely file it under paradise if it were not for a very unpleasant feel inthe energy there. I experienced a feeling of underlying ‘evil’.[../Images/00035.jpg]Figure 20: The extended pentagram identified by David Wood and Ian Campbell inthe area around Rennes-le-Chateau. They connected churches and other keylandscape features.The fantastic geometrical patterns in this area connecting mountains, sacredsites and churches, have been identified in modern times by people like HenryLincoln, a pioneer researcher of the Rennes-le-Chateau mysteries, and David Woodand Ian Campbell in their books Genisis and Geneset (see Figure 20). The goddessIsis is mentioned in old records of Rennes-les-Bains, a short distance fromRennes-le-Chateau, and in the last century a statue of Isis was found near thevillage.15 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589809] Wood and Campbellsuggest that Rennes-le-Chateau and Rennes-le-Bains translate as Queen of theHouse and Queen of the Waters – the names given by the ancient Egyptians totheir goddesses Nephthys and Isis.16[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589909] The area around Rennes-le-Chateauis one of enormous power and importance within the Earth’s energy grid andtherefore became a focus from ancient times for those who understood this andknew how to harness the energy. The modern world awoke to the story ofRennes-le-Chateau with Henry Lincoln’s BBC television films and the book, HolyBlood, Holy Grail, written by Lincoln with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. Itwas inspired by the story of Berenger Sauniere, who, in 1885, became priest atthe church of St Mary Magdalene at Rennes-le-Chateau. Sauniere was born atnearby Montazels. The church was in a terrible state and, the story goes, in1887 he and two workmen began the immense task of repairing the worst of thedamage to the interior. They lifted a flagstone near the altar and saw anengraving on the underside depicting two men on one horse. This symbol was thefirst seal of the Knights Templar. The flagstone became known as the KnightsStone and can be seen in the village museum. When Sauniere realised there mightbe something of importance to find, he continued the search alone. Thebreakthrough came when he dismantled the altar and inside one of the pillars hefound hollow wooden tubes, sealed with wax. Inside those he discoveredparchments which, he later established, were written in code. After consultinghis church superiors in Carcassonne, he travelled to Paris and the RomanCatholic occult research centre called St Sulpice which is positioned on theParis time meridian on a site of ‘former’ Isis/Semiramis worship. Here theyemployed experts in medieval texts, writings and codes. Research so far hassuggested that Sauniere’s parchments contained a genealogy dated 1244 (the yearthe Cathars were slaughtered at Montsegur) which confirmed the survival of theMerovingian bloodline; another Merovingian genealogy from 1244 to 1644; and twocompiled in the 1780s apparently by Abbe Antoine Bigou, a previous priest atRennes-le-Chateau, and personal chaplain to the Blanchefort family. I don’tbelieve for a second that this is all that Sauniere found. Anything that reallymattered would never have been made public and it is quite possible thatSauniere did not find his parchments in the church at all. Maybe it’s a coverstory to obscure the real tale.The Priory of Sion ‘leaked’ copies of the two Bigou parchments in 1967, or atleast in the 1960s. The Priory of Sion is believed to have originated in Troyes,France, the city founded by the Sicabrian Franks (Merovingians) where theTemplars were officially formed. The Priory of Sion arrived on the scene aboutthe same time as the Templars, the Knights of Malta and the Teutonic Knights,and it had a particularly close association with the Templars. But someresearchers believe the true origins of the Priory of Sion go much further back.Its Grand Masters are called Nautonnier or Navigators and the ones between 1188and 1918 were listed (or claimed to be) in documents known as the DossiersSecrets, which were privately published texts deposited at the National Libraryin Paris. Among them were Marie and Jean de Saint-Clair; Leonardo da Vinci;Sandro Botticelli, another Italian artist and friend of da Vinci; NicolasFlamel, the famous medieval alchemist; Robert Fludd, the philosopher; IsaacNewton, who ‘discovered’ the law of gravity and was a major player in thecreation of the this-world-is-all-there-is version of ‘science’; Robert Boyle, aclose friend of Newton and another founder of modern ‘science’; and JeanCocteau, the French writer and artist. Two others in office during the lifetimeof Sauniere, were the French writer and poet Victor Hugo, and his friend thecomposer Claude Debussy, a Grand Master of the Rosicrucian Order (allRamses-Piso-Bush, I am sure you will find). One of Debussy’s most famous operaswas a Merovingian drama. A recent Grand Master appears to be Pierre Plantard deSaint-Clair who, according to documents revealed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, is adescendant of Dagobert II (Ramses-Piso-Bush) and the Merovingian dynasty.Dagobert was the Merovingian heir who was sent into exile in Ireland as a child.He returned to take his crown, but was later murdered. His son is supposed tohave survived. There is no way the Merovingian bloodline died out. It hadcountless strands. I think that Pierre Plantard has misled the authors of HolyBlood, Holy Grail in many ways, and the idea that the Merovingian bloodlines arethe bloodline of Jesus is without foundation. This is nothing to do with Jesus.The reason you find so many references to Arcadia in relation toRennes-le-Chateau is because Arcadia in Sparta was the legendary home of Zeusand the Titans – the reptilian bloodlines of Troy. That is the origin of thesebloodlines, not Jesus, who did not even exist. Pierre Plantard(Ramses-Piso-Bush), who knows the truth, but doesn’t want you to know, was bornin 1920 and, with the approval of the German oppressors, he edited a magazine inNazi-occupied France in 1942 called Conquest For A Young Knighthood. 17[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos589993] It was the journal of a Paris basedMasonic-chivalric society called the Order Alpha-Galates, and Plantard becameits Grand Master at the age of 22.18[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590108] This is certainly not a man who’sword is his bond.At St Sulpice in Paris, the village priest Abbe Berenger Sauniere met with AbbeBieil, the Director General of the Seminary, and the latter’s nephew, EmileHoffet.19 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590192] Through Hoffet he waswarmly welcomed into a circle of esoteric friends, including the famous operasinger, Emma Calve, and Claude Debussy, the Grand Master of the Priory of Sionas well as the Rosicrucians. Sauniere and Calve began a close relationship andshe visited him at Rennes-le-Chateau. Calve was at the heart of the occultmovements in France and one of her intimates was the Marquis Stanislas deGualta, a founder of the modern version of the Order of the Rose-Croix, theRosicrucians.20 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590307] Most of the GrandMasters of the Priory of Sion have Rosicrucian connections. Another of Calve’sfriends was Jules Bois, a notorious Satanist, and close associate of a fellowSatanist, MacGregor Mathers.21 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590398]Encouraged by Bois, Mathers established the British occult society, the Order ofthe Golden Dawn, of which the Satanist, Aleister Crowley, was a most prominentmember. The Order of the Golden Dawn and its offshoots and personnel, likeCrowley, were involved with both the Nazis and the British Satanist, Druid, andwartime Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. The pointed-arm ‘heil Hitler’salute was in fact a ritual sign of the Order of the Golden Dawn. Another famousmember of the Golden Dawn was the poet, W. B. Yeats, a friend of Claude Debussy.Yeats quite brilliantly summed up the aims of the Babylonian Brotherhood when hedescribed his ideal society:“…an aristocratic civilisation in its most completed form, every detail of hislife hierachical, every great man’s door crowded at dawn with petitioners, greatwealth everywhere in few men’s hands, all dependent upon a few, up to theEmperor himself, who is a God dependent upon a greater God and everywhere, inCourt, in the family, an inequality made law.”22[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590482]This is precisely the vision for the human race planned by the reptilians. IfSauniere and his friends were operating among Emma Calve’s circle, we aretalking Satanism here. I’m not saying that Sauniere was a Satanist because Idon’t know, but he knew people who were. Other famous visitors of Sauniere atRennes-le-Chateau were the French Secretary of State for Culture and theArchduke Johann von Habsburg, a cousin of Franz-Josef, the Emperor of Austria.23[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590645] The Habsburgs, a big-time reptilianbloodline, ruled the Holy Roman Empire for 500 years before its demise in 1806.The Priory of Sion, the Merovingian bloodline, and Rennes-le-Chateau, definitelyconnect into the wider web I am exposing.Among the most significant Freemasonic lodges in the world today is the GrandAlpine Lodge in Switzerland. Henry Kissinger, one of the planet’s most activeservants of the reptilians (he is one), is a member. It is involved at a veryhigh level in the global manipulation (see …And The Truth Shall Set You Free)and it is most definitely Satanic. A work entitled The Merovingian DescendantsAnd The Enigma Of The Visigoth Razes was published, according to its title page,by the Grand Alpine Lodge, though they now deny it.24[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590760] Razes is the old name for the areaaround Rennes-le-Chateau.25 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590850] It wasfirst published in German and then translated into French by a WalterCelse-Nazaire, a pseudonym made up of the saints after whom the church atRennes-les-Bains is dedicated. The secrets held in Rennes-le-Chateau and theLanguedoc are extremely important to these people. The composer, Richard Wagner,used unusual names from the Rennes area in his operas and in his work, TheValkyrie, we see again the theme of someone condemned to eternal sleep in theruins of an enchanted castle. There are many ruined enchanted castles aroundRennes-le-Chateau and Wagner’s Castle of Valhalla is a castle on the ParisMeridian a few miles from the village.26[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos590934] Adolf Hitler, who was obsessed withblack magic, said that to understand the Nazis, one had to understand Wagner.One legend has it that Wagner visited Sauniere at Rennes-le-Chateau. JulesVerne, the science ‘fiction’ writer, was a high initiate who knew much secretknowledge. His book, Chateau Of The Carpathians, includes several names uniqueto the Rennes-le-Chateau area, and in Verne’s Clovis d’Ardentor, one thecharacters is Captain Bugarach – the name of a peak near Rennes-le-Chateau knownlocally as the magnetic mountain. Clovis was also the name of one of the firstMerovingian kings. A farm near Rennes-les-Bains is called Jouanne, another nameused for a Jules Verne character.27 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591034]Back in Rennes-le-Chateau after his visit to Paris, Sauniere began a spendingspree well beyond the means of a poorly paid village priest. Where did hissudden wealth come from? He built a house which he called Villa Bethaniaalongside the church for himself and his housekeeper, Marie Denarnaud. Close by,he built a watchtower on the edge of a sheer cliff overlooking the valley andmountains. He called it La Tour Magdala and he said it was a library. Havingseen it, I don’t believe that. There is very little room for books and it hardlyconstitutes a ‘library’. It is, however, placed precisely on the spot where acircle connecting churches meets a point on the pentagram in the geometricalpattern identified by Wood and Campbell. The name Magdala means watchtower andthe watchtower is a Brotherhood symbol for Mary Magdalene – the female energy,Isis, Semiramis. Note that it is also the symbol of the Jehovah’s Witnesses,another prison-religion, created by Brotherhood frontmen like the high degreeFreemason, Charles Taze Russell. They’re all connected, the secret societies andthe religions they created. Sauniere spent profusely on art and antiques; hepaid for a water tower to improve the village supply; and he spent a fortune tobuild a road to replace the long dirt track up the mountain toRennes-le-Chateau. He also began to correspond with people all over Europe. Mostnotably, he transformed his church with his new-found wealth. It was fullyrestored and refurbished with strange statues and esoteric symbols. On theentrance to the church he had written in French: “This place is terrible”. Asyou walk through the door you are faced with a demonic statue depicting aparticular version of the Devil. It is Asmodeus who, the legend says, was forcedby King Solomon to help with the building of his temple in Jerusalem. A cuttingwith a picture of Asmodeus in chains was found among Sauniere’s possessions. Aplate glass window features Mary Magdalene anointing the feet of Jesus and astatue of Mary Magdalene includes a skull at her feet – that symbol of theTemplar rituals. The floor is laid out with the black and white squares of aMasonic temple. A feature of the Sauniere-inspired decoration in the church isthe rose and the cross. This is the symbol of the secret society called theRosicrucians or Rose Croix and it goes back to ancient times. Templar artefactsretrieved from Paris and Cyprus feature the rose and cross.28[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591124] The rose once again relates togoddess worship and sexual symbolism. The Romans knew the rose as the Flower ofVenus (Venus = Semiramis) and it was the badge of her ‘sacred prostitutes’. Inthe Venus sexual mysteries, anything ‘sub rosa’ meaning under the rose, was notto be revealed to the uninitiated.29[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591272] Mother Mary, when used as a symbolfor the goddess energy, was referred to as the Rose, Rose-bush, Rose-garland orMystic Rose.30 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591356] The name Rose mayalso come from Eros, the symbol for sexual love. The Rosicrucians link into theBrotherhood network, as do the Jesuits. Sauniere’s brother, Alfred, was aJesuit. The guy at the museum in Rennes-le-Chateau told me that Sauniere couldhave been a member of the Rosicrucian Order and I would have been surprised ifhe wasn’t. There is a cross and red rose on his grave in the churchyard. A redrose on a grave can indicate an exemplary life or that the person’s life wasended prematurely. When Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair, a Grand Master of thePriory of Sion, made a visit to Rennes-le-Chateau, he was seen performing astrange ceremony at Sauniere’s grave. Obviously, questions were asked by thechurch hierarchy about Sauniere’s spending spree, but when the crunch came hewas supported by the Pope himself.Sauniere was working closely, and in secret, with two other local priests, AbbeBoudet at Rennes-le-Bains, and Abbe Gelis at Coutaussa. The two villages areonly a short distance from Rennes-le-Chateau. Records show that Boudet, a friendof Pierre Plantard’s grandfather, paid Sauniere and his Jesuit brother largesums of money.31 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591440] All threeapparently enjoyed unexplained windfalls of cash. In 1897 their closeassociation was broken by conflict between Sauniere and Boudet, and the viciousand bloody murder of Gelis, who had become a recluse, living behind a lockeddoor in fear of his life. With good reason, it turned out. He was bludgeoned todeath by someone he clearly knew and trusted, because he opened his door to themand a bell alarm Gelis had installed was not activated. Despite the violence ofhis death and the intense struggle which preceded it, his body was left neatlylaid out on the floor in almost ritualistic fashion.32[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591619] In his church at Coutaussa were thenow familiar symbols, the lion paws, the grapes and the vine, and a form of theStar of David, the six pointed star, with one triangle superimposed on the otherinstead of being interweaved as normal. Exactly the same symbol was found onSauniere’s bookplate.33 [../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591710] On Gelis’sgrave, topped by a Maltese/Templar cross, is the word Assassine and theheadstone is adorned with a rose, the symbol of the Rosicrucians and ofpremature death. Sauniere died following a stroke in 1917. The stroke happenedon January 17th 1917, which appears to be a very significant date to theBabylonian Brotherhood. It is the feast day of St Sulpice. It was to St SulpiceChurch in Paris that Sauniere travelled with his parchments; it was thegroundplan of St Sulpice which appeared in the mysterious documents called LeSerpent Rouge; St Sulpice was designed according to the laws of sacred geometryin 1645 on the ruins of a temple of Isis and was the headquarters of theCompagnie du Saint-Sacrement, an alleged front for the Priory of Sion; andVictor Hugo, a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, was married at St Sulpice. LeSerpent Rouge was dated January 17th and it emphasises that January 17th comesunder the astrological house of Capricorn, the goat, which, in its negativedepiction, is Baphomet and the Goat of Mendes, the symbol of Satanism and theTemplars (see Figure 21). This originates from the symbolic sacrifice of a goatby the Israelites in honour of the Watcher (reptilian) called Azazel who alsobecame symbolised as an inverted pentagram – the ‘goat head’. Nicholas Flamel,another Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, was said to have performed his firstalchemical transmutation at noon on January 17th. A statue of Charles deLorraine (Ramses-Piso-Bush), a Grand Master of both the Priory of Sion and theTeutonic Order, was unveiled in Brussels on January 17th 1775.34[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591801] If you think this is allcoincidence, I would ask you not to underestimate how important precise datesand times are to the Babylonian Brotherhood. Every split second has a differentvibration as the Earth’s magnetic field is subtly changed by the Sun and themovement of the planets, and every number and combination of numbers carry theirown unique vibratory signature. Sauniere transferred all his money andpossessions to his housekeeper, Marie Denarnaud, his confidant throughout theperiod we have been documenting. She is alleged to have said to a friend:[../Images/00036.jpg]Figure 21: The composite symbol of the malevolent force, Baphomet.“The people around here walk around on gold without knowing it… With that whichthe Monsieur has left we could feed Rennes for a hundred years and there wouldstill be enough left over… one day I will tell you a secret which will make ofyou a rich man – very, very rich.”35[../Text/index_split_023.html#filepos591892]But she never did. Rennes-le-Chateau is a place of so many secrets and in somany ways encapsulates the ‘hall of mirrors’ that has kept the truth from thepeople for so long. However, the veil is lifting and the truth is emerging. Thecomplication in the story of Rennes-le-Chateau, and the Brotherhood in general,is the feuding that goes on between competing factions operating beneath thesame overall leadership. It means that people who you know are involved areundermined or murdered by others you know are involved. This can be confusingunless you understand the game. Such infighting is inevitable with the mindsetof these people, and often it suits the Brotherhood leadership to have thesefeuds spill over into the public arena. It creates the very chaos, the divideand rule, which they need to manipulate their Agenda into being. But this upperhierarchy can quickly bring the factions into line when the fighting threatensthe over all Agenda on which all sides agree – control of the world. Just such abattle broke out between the Priory of Sion and its military arm, the KnightsTemplar, which led to considerable conflict in the centuries that followed. In1187, the Templars lost control of Jerusalem to the Saracen Turks, possibly onpurpose, and a conflict followed with their former allies and official masters,the Priory of Sion. A year later they formerly separated in a ritual known asthe Cutting of the Elm at Gisors, a city close to the coast in northern France.The Order of Sion changed its name to the Priory of Sion and adopted as itsemblem, the red cross used by the Templars. The Priory also adopted the title,l’Ordre de la Rose-Cross Veritas, the Order of the True Red Cross. The twosecret societies agreed to operate independently, but the Priory of Sion wantedthe Templar wealth which it believed it rightly owned and it probably used theMerovingian king of France, Philippe the Fair, in an attempt to do this.The purge of the TemplarsFirst Philippe removed two Popes until he found one who would take his orders.He sent one of his heavies to assault and abuse Pope Boniface VIII, who diedshortly afterwards. He then poisoned a second Pope, Benedict XI. This allowedhim to install his own choice, the Archbishop of Bordeax, who became PopeClement V. He moved the Papacy to Avignon and produced a split in the RomanChurch for 68 years while rival Popes resided in France and in Rome. Havingestablished his own personal Pope, Philippe turned his mind to the KnightsTemplar. He coveted their wealth, hated their power and was a puppet of thePriory of Sion. The Templars lost much of their influence with the Church after1291 when the Saracens defeated the Christian Crusaders and ejected them fromthe Holy Land. Philippe, in league with his puppet Pope, set out to destroy theTemplars. In 1306 he had arrested every Jew in France, banished them from thecountry and taken all their property. He then planned a similar operation andsecretly arranged for all Templars in France to be arrested at dawn on Friday,October 13th 1307. Friday the 13th has been deemed unlucky ever since. ManyTemplars were seized, including their Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, andsubjected to the unimaginable torture of the Inquisition. But there is clearevidence that many Templars knew of the plan and escaped.Documents detailing their rules and rituals were removed or destroyed before theraids and when the vaults were opened at the Templar headquarters in Paris, thevast fortune Philippe so coveted was gone. He and his Pope pressured othermonarchs to arrest the Templars, but this wasn’t easy. In the German, laterFrench, region of Lorraine, the duke (Ramses-Piso-Bush) supported the Templarsand in other parts of Germany the Templars went unprosecuted. Others changedtheir name from Knights Templar and continued as before in another guise. Somejoined the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Malta) or the Teutonic Order. Thearistocratic bloodlines of Lorraine are some of the ‘purest’ reptiliancrossbreeds and one of them is today one of the biggest players in the globalSatanic ritual network. While officially these three orders were not connectedand did not like each other, they were, at their upper levels, the sameorganisation.Edward II (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the English king, did his best for years to ignorethe papal order to arrest the Templars and, when pressed further, he was aslenient with them as possible. Scotland and Ireland did the same. Eventually,however, the Inquisitors arrived and the Templars either left England or Irelandor met their fate. Scotland was a very different story. The Templar fleetescaped from France at the time of the purge, particularly from their main portat La Rochelle, and took their wealth with them. There is, however, anotherpossibility that Philippe the Fair was duped by the Priory of Sion who hadarranged for the English fleet to intercept the fleeing Templar ships and stealthe gold that way. That’s possible. The Templars headed for Scotland, Portugal,and most likely, the Americas as they knew that continent existed because theyhad access to the underground knowledge of the Aryan Elite and they were wellaware that the Phoenicians had been to the Americas thousands of years before.The choice of Scotland was obvious for many reasons. The St Clair-Sinclairs werethere and so were the other ancient Brotherhood bloodlines which arrived withthe original Phoenicians or came from Belgium and northern France to settlethere much later. The head of one of these families, Robert the Bruce, was atwar with another branch of the Aryans, the English, for control of Scotland andhe was excommuni-cated by the Pope. This meant that the papal order to destroythe Templars was not applicable in the areas controlled by Bruce. It was to herethat many Templars headed after the purge in France. They sailed around the westcoast of Ireland to land on the north west coast of Scotland between Islay, Juraand the Mull of Kintyre. Along this coast many Templar graves and relics havebeen found at places like Kilmory and Kilmartin. The Templars also settled inthe region called Dalriada, now Argyll, and they were soon to play a crucialpart in the most famous battle in Scottish history."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos513173] Geoffrey Higgins, Anacalypsis(reprinted in 1972 by Health Research, PO Box 850, Pomeroy, WA 99347, USA, firstpublished 1836).2 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos513381] Michael Baigent, Richard Leighand Henry Lincoln, Holy Blood, Holy Grail (Corgi Books, London, 1982), pp 449,450.3 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos526350] Joy Hancox, The Byrom Collection(Jonathan Cape, London, 1992), p 131.4 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos550430] The Occult Conspiracy p 48.5 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos552960] David Wood and Ian Campbell,Geneset (Bellevue Books, Sunbury on Thames, England, 1994) , pp 104, 105.6 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos553269] Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince,The Templar Revelation (Bantam Press, London, 1997), p 45.7 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos553450] Ibid.8 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos553693] Ibid.9 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos553863] Ibid.10 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos555280] Ibid, p 49.11 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos555888] Ibid, p 68.12 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos556234] Ibid.13 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos559469] Geneset, p 34.14 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos559898] Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 33.15 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos561200] Geneset, p 36.16 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos561491] Ibid.17 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos566756] The Templar Revelation, p 43.18 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos566988] Ibid.19 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos567345] Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 27.20 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos567925] Ibid, p 159.21 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos568214] Ibid.22 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos569381] Quoted by Francis King in SatanAnd Swastika (Mayflower Books, London, 1976).23 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos569976] Holy Blood, Holy Grail, p 29.24 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos570894] Ibid, p 97.25 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos571038] Ibid.26 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos571783] Geneset, p 33.27 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos572583] Ibid, p 33.28 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos575199] The Woman’s Encyclopaedia OfMyths And Secrets, pp 866, 867.29 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos575595] Ibid.30 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos575806] Ibid.31 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos577108] Richard Andrews and PaulSchellenberger, The Tomb Of God (Little Brown, London, 1996), p 177.32 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos577801] Ibid, p 187.33 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos578182] Ibid, p 182.34 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos579906] Ibid, p 259.35 [../Text/index_split_022.html#filepos581188] Ibid, pp 172, 173."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos6594]Same face, different mask [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos6594]In the years before the Templars arrived in force from France, Robert theBruce’s campaign against the English had been pretty disastrous. He was forcedto seek refuge in the Perthshire mountains and later in Argyll. From there heheaded for Kintyre and the north of Ireland.Bruce had very close connections with Ulster and owned land there. Bruce’stitle, the Earl of Carrick, can be seen in a number of place names in this partof Ireland, including Carrickfergus. The people of Ulster have long politicaland blood associations with the Scots, particularly on the west coast ofScotland, but they have been manipulated into conflict many times. At the heartof the troubles in Ulster to this day are the squabbles between the Irish(Catholics) and the Scots-Irish (Protestants) who moved into Ulster fromScotland. These conflicts are manipulated and encouraged by the Brotherhoodthrough their placemen. With support from Irish noble families, Bruce returnedto Scotland in 1307, the year of the Templar purge in France, and he soon foundhimself fighting a new English king as Edward II replaced Edward I. Bruce’scampaign gathered momentum thanks to support and weapons from the Templarsfleeing France, and it culminated in the battle of Bannockburn, near StirlingCastle, on John the Baptist’s Day (Nimrod’s day), June 24th 1314. The Scotsrouted the English after a day of battle when a force of ‘unknown’ horsemenarrived to support the Scottish ranks. For some reason, never explained, theEnglish panicked and ran at the sight of these reinforcements. They had to be aspecial fighting force and they had to be immediately recognisable to stimulatesuch an instant reaction. The Templars were both, and this ‘unknown’ group hadto be the Knights Templar, the warriors so feared in the crusades, who had nowregrouped in Scotland. The victory at Bannockburn would ensure the independenceof Scotland for the next 289 years and among those who fought with Bruce thatday was Sir William St Clair of Rosslyn. When Bruce died in 1329, the Stuartdynasty began. In France in Merovingian times, they appointed Mayors of thePalace to support the monarch and from the time of King David I, Scotland hadinstalled a similar system. They were called Royal Stewards and these positionsbecame hereditary. It later changed to Stewart and from this line came theStuarts. Again, as with the Merovingians, the hereditary mayors or stewards tothe official royal line eventually became the royal line themselves. This cameafter Bruce’s daughter married Walter the Steward or Stewart. Upon Bruce’sdeath, the first child of this unison became Robert II of Scotland. The Stuartline had its first king.A creation of the officially disbanded Knights Templar was the Order of theGarter, the premier order of chivalry, created by Edward III (Ramses-Piso-Bush)in 1348 and still headed by the British monarch. It is an Elite front for thereptilians of the Babylonian Brotherhood and is dedicated to the ‘Virgin Mary’ –Semiramis/ Ninkharsag. Meetings of the Order took place under Edward in aspecial chamber at Windsor Castle around a table modelled on the one in KingArthur legend. Windsor Castle is built on an ancient and very powerful sacredenergy vortex and this is where the Satanist and reptilian, Henry Kissinger, wasknighted by the Queen (Ramses-Piso-Bush). She is knowingly working for theBrotherhood Agenda and the Order of the Garter is one of her premier networks.Edward III’s name was Windsor and when the present royal family decided tochange their German name to an English one for public relations reasons duringthe First World War, they chose Windsor, after the man who founded this keyBrotherhood order. The insignia of the Order of the Garter is a jewelled collarwith red roses alternating with 26 gold knots representing the 26 knights in twogroups of 13.1 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669198] Similar ordersemerged in France with the Order of the Star, the Order of the Golden Fleece,and the Order of St Michael. The Freemasons are the Knights Templar and thePriory of Sion under another name and the Company of Jesus or Jesuits are basedon the same structure as the Templars with the same goal. The Jesuits and theKnights of Malta are esoteric secret societies which hoard and use the secretknowledge while outwardly claiming to be Roman Catholic and ‘Christian’. Theyare doing exactly the same as the Templars did at the time of the Crusades andtogether they control, with the higher levels of Freemasonry, the Vatican, thePope and the Roman Catholic Church. In other words, they control both sides, theesoteric underground and the Church which condemns this very same underground asevil. Thus they control the game and the ultimate outcome of the game – unlesswe wake up fast. An obvious example of this came after the papal purge on theTemplars. In 1312, all lands and property owned by the Templars were given bythe Pope to their ‘rivals’ the Knights Hospitaller of St John, later called theKnights of Rhodes and now the Knights of Malta (Catholic) and the Knights of StJohn (Protestant). Both were the same force, as were, and are, the TeutonicKnights. All were involved in the same things, including banking, and used thesame vicious, unscrupulous methods to get their way. For more than 200 yearsuntil the middle of the 16th century, the Hospitallers and the Templars weremerged into a joint order and much Templar land and property was not absorbed bythe Knights Hospitaller, even though most of it was there for the taking.The Templars restored their influence in France under the title of the ScotsGuard in the mid 15th century. When Robert the Bruce was installed as theunchallenged king of Scotland, he signed a pact with Charles IV of France,renewing what was known as the ‘auld alliance’. This was no surprise, given thatthe bloodlines which controlled Scotland, including Bruce and the Sinclairs,came from France and Flanders. In 1445, a later King Charles, Charles VII,formed the first standing army in Europe since the Templars and, in fact, it wasthe Templars. Pride of place in Charles’s army was the Scottish Company and itwas at the front of all parades. Even more powerful and influential, however,was the élite Scots Guard which consisted of 33 men – a very significantesoteric number which would manifest again in the 33 degrees of the ScottishRite of Freemasonry. The Scots Guard was there to guard the king and they evenslept in his bedroom. Not all 33, I hope. As the numbers in the guard increasedit was by multiples of 13, again in keeping with esoteric numerological laws anda key number to the Knights Templar. Commanders of the Scots Guard wereautomatically made members of the secret society called the Order of St Michael,which later established a branch in Scotland. Another common theme of themanipulation into the present day is that people operating behind one ‘mask’ arealso members of other, sometimes many other, ‘masks’ working to the same agenda.Yet again, the Scots Guard (Templars) proved to be expert at the Trojan Horsetechnique. They infiltrated and took over the administration of France as‘advisors’ and ‘ambassadors’. Charles was their puppet and the names of thisScots Guard élite are getting familiar… Sinclair, Stuart, Hamilton, Hay,Montgomery, Cunningham, Cockburn and Seton. These were the families who came toScotland from France and Flanders and could trace their bloodlines back to theancient Near East and the Anunnaki. They took over Scotland and now theyre-established their influence in France. The Scots Guard was another front forthe secret knowledge, the unfolding of the Templar Agenda, and the Satanicrituals of which the Templars had been accused. Nothing changes, except thename. A present member of the Montgomery family told the authors of The TempleAnd The Lodge that an order was formed at the time of the Scots Guard in whichall male members of the Montgomery family were eligible. It was called the Orderof the Temple.2 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669311] The Templars wouldlater re-emerge as the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.Another significant connection into this same network was the House of Lorrainein the northern France-Germany region and in particular the Duke of Lorraineknown as Rene d’Anjou (Ramses-Piso-Bush), who was born in 1408. He became GrandMaster of the Priory of Sion at the age of ten and operated under the guidanceof his uncle Louis, Cardinal de Bar, until he was 20.3[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669499] This is a big-time reptilianbloodline. His list of titles included Count of Provence (near Rennes-le-Chateaucountry), Count of Guise, Duke of Anjou, King of Hungary, King of Naples andSicily, King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca and Sardinia, and the symbolic one ofKing of Jerusalem.4 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669618] The lattertitle is very important to the Brotherhood. The next in line for King ofJerusalem is the reptilian, Karl von Habsburg, and his name, numerologically,equates to 666. One of Rene d’Anjou’s daughters married Henry VI of England in1445 and was prominent in the Wars of the Roses in which the red rose of Henryof Lancaster met the white rose of York in 1455. Rene d’Anjou had connections inevery direction and he was a classic Brotherhood figure at the centre of a vastweb. Just two of the famous names of history to whom he was connected wereChristopher Columbus and Joan of Arc. At one time he employed ChristopherColumbus and the enormous significance of this will become clear soon. Joan ofArc, it appears, was born as a subject of Rene d’Anjou in the duchy of Bar.According to official history, in 1429 she announced her ‘divine mission’ tosave France from the English invaders and to ensure that Charles became king ofFrance, as he did as Charles VII. She asked for an audience with Rene d’Anjou’sfather-in-law and great uncle and when the meeting took place, Rene, waspresent.5 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669701] To fulfil her mission,she said, according to the official tale, she needed Rene, a horse, and: “somegood men to take me into France”. Historians who chronicled Rene’s life suggestthat he left with Joan to meet with Charles and was at her side in hervictorious battles against the English which put Charles on the throne. Hiswhereabouts cannot be accounted for between the years 1429–1431, the very yearswhen Joan of Arc was at the peak of her military career. Joan was eventuallyburned at the stake by the Inquisition as a witch and it is very clear when youlook at the evidence that her whole story was another historical smokescreen. Weare supposed to believe that this young girl from a poor background knocked onthe door of the aristocracy and they allowed her to lead a war against theEnglish. Yes, OK, and I can tie my willy to the lamppost across the street. Theman who was really behind that military campaign was Rene d’Anjou with the storyof Joan of Arc (based on the legend of the ‘Virgin of Lorraine’) merely aconvenient way of hiding the real goings on.It was Rene d’Anjou who was responsible for the two-bar cross becoming known asthe Cross of Lorraine. The double cross symbol was later used by some aspects ofthe Christian Church and it is the origin of the term to be ‘double crossed’,manipulated. This has become another symbol of the reptilian Brotherhood and youcan see it in the logo of the oil giant, Exxon, controlled by their Americanbranch managers, the Rockefellers. Rene d’Anjou was steeped in the esotericunderground and a student of the Arthurian and Grail legends. Through hisextensive possessions and connections in Italy he interlocked with the BlackNobility and other aristocratic families and he was an inspiration behind theemergence of the Renaissance when the ancient knowledge of Egypt and Greece wastranslated into European languages. In Rene d’Anjou’s court was an astrologercalled Jean de Saint-Remy and, according to several accounts, he was thegrandfather of the most famous psychic-astrologer of all time, Nostradamus. Thismakes sense because in the 16th century Nostradamus was closely connected to theHouse of Lorraine and it’s offshoot, the House of Guise, as they pursued abloody campaign of assassination against their bloodline rivals in a bid,ultimately unsuccessful, to win the throne of France. He was also doctor toCatherine de Medici (Ramses-Piso-Bush) of the black nobility family so powerfulin Venice. She was the Queen of France who died in 1589. His very name gives hisbackground away. Nostradamus’ real name was Michel de Notre Dame, Michael of OurLady. The French writer and investigator, Gerard de Sede, who it seems hadinsider contacts, claimed that Nostradamus was an agent for the Houses ofLorraine and Guise and was using his position as astrologer to the French courtto manipulate on their behalf. De Sede further suggests that many of thepredictions or ‘quatrains’ by Nostradmus were not so much predictions asmessages, ciphers, timetables, instructions and symbolism of past events andgroups. He says that Nostradamus spent a long time in Lorraine being trainedbefore he entered the royal court of their rivals and in this period he wasgiven access to an ancient book on which all his work became based. No wonder hewas apparently such a brilliant astrologer, he knew what few others wereprivileged to know. Incidentally, Gerard de Sede also claims that theMerovingian bloodline are extraterrestrials which, of course, has been dismissedas ludicrous, but I say he’s right. At least they are a ‘royal’ bloodline whichhas been occupied and controlled by the reptilians of the lower fourthdimension.6 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos669791]In the 16th and 17th centuries, a stream of events unfolded to advance theBrotherhood Agenda. The extent and influence of the underground esotericnetworks had continued to expand and now it was possible to begin the next stageof the global takeover. Rene d’Anjou (Ramses-Piso-Bush) was one of the keyplayers behind the Renaissance when, through his many contacts in Italy andparticularly Florence, he helped to orchestrate the translation, publishing anddistribution of ancient Greek, Egyptian and Gnostic works, including those ofPlato and Pythagoras. This transformed art and culture among the privilegedclasses of Europe and the power of the church was under more challenge than everbefore. It also enlisted many more influential people into the gathering secretsociety network. The pressure on the church establishment was increased stillfurther by the publication of the Rosicrucian Manifestos in 1614 to 1616 whichclaimed to be issued by a secret group of initiates in Germany and France. Theypledged to transform the world with the esoteric knowledge and herald a new eraof religious and political freedom. The Catholic Church and the Holy RomanEmpire were fiercely condemned. The Order of the Rose Cross or Rosicrucians,however, was no new fad. It was founded, apparently, at least as long ago as thePharaoh Thothmes III in the 15th century BC. His personal seal (cartouche) isused on modern Rosicrucian literature7[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670151] and the Rosicrucians connect withthe Royal Court of the Dragon in ancient Egypt. It is now widely believed byresearchers that the Manifestos were written by the German esotericist, JohannValentin Andrea, who is listed as a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. Anotherhighly influential voice for Rosicrucian thought was Robert Fludd, the man whopreceded Andrea as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.The Bacon legacyOne of the most important men of this entire era was the Rosicrucian, FrancisBacon. His influence was colossal. He was the Grand Master of the Rosicruciansin England, a major force in the creation of Freemasonry, the ‘father’ of modernscience, and possibly one of the authors of the ‘Shakespeare’ plays. He was alsoa member of a secret society called the Order of the Helmet, dedicated to theworship of the goddess of wisdom, Pallas Athene, who was portrayed as wearing ahelmet and holding a spear.8 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670270]Researchers and investigators like Manly P. Hall, the renowned Freemasonichistorian, have little doubt that Bacon was born from a liaison between QueenElizabeth I, the ‘virgin queen’, and her lover Robert Dudley, the Earl ofLeicester.9 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670359] He was brought up byNicholas and Anne Bacon and would become the most influential man in thecountry, overtly and covertly, with the title of Viscount of St Albans and therole of Lord Chancellor of England. (This was the Bacon role, you might say.) IfBacon was the son of Queen Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth), he was of a reptilianbloodline, and this would explain his rapid rise to prominence in politics andthe secret societies. He worked secretly through the underground channels, amongthem the Inns of Court, the centre of the Brotherhood-controlled legalprofession which is based on the former Templar lands in the now aptly named,Temple Bar, in London. It was a time of great conflict and upheaval as theBrotherhood sought to use the church as a vehicle for widespread war and chaos.One of their frontmen for this was Martin Luther, a product of German secretsocieties and a Rosicrucian. His personal seal was a rose and cross. In 1517,this professor of theology at Wittenberg University listed 95 complaints againstthe Vatican for selling pardons to raise money to build St Peter’s Church.Luther was excommunicated, but he burned the decree along with copies of RomanChurch law and launched his own Lutheran Church. Protestant Christianity hadbegun and conflict was unleashed across Europe as Protestants and Catholics wentto war to decide which version of the same nonsense would prevail. Funny thatthe Rosicrucians claimed to stand for religious and political freedom and yetone of their puppets, Martin Luther, stood for anything but. He hatedfreethinking and open minded research. In one sermon he said that his followersshould throw spit in the face of reason, because she was the Devil’s whore,rotten with the itch of leprosy, and should be kept in the toilet.10[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670492] Lovely. He also wrote:“Damned be love into the abyss of hell, if it is maintained to the damage offaith… It is better that tyrants should sin a hundred times against the peoplethan the people should sin once against the tyrants… the ass wants to bethrashed, the mob to be governed by force.”11[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670618]Speak for yourself, darlin’. A Frenchman, known in English as John Calvin, alsoproduced his version of Protestant Christianity, another extreme and arrogantcreed called Calvinism. This spawned the Puritan movement which was soinfluential in the European occupation of North America. The Protestant Churchcame to England because King Henry VIII wanted a son and heir and his firstwife, Catherine of Aragon, had produced ‘only’ a daughter. He wanted to divorceher and try his luck elsewhere, but Pope Clement VII refused to sanction this.Henry at this time was a committed Catholic, at least in public, and the Popehad awarded him the title Defender of the Faith. Ironically, this same title,awarded by a Roman Catholic Pope, is still held by British monarchs to this dayto defend the Protestant faith! You’ve got to chuckle, really. What a farce itall is. Henry, being much miffed by the Pope’s refusal to sanction his divorce,ordered Parliament to create a Church of England, independent of Rome. He madehimself the head of the new Church in the Act of Supremacy of 1534 and unleasheda bloody purge against Roman Catholics. Henry was succeeded by his only son,Edward, but after he died at the age of 15, he was replaced by Henry’s daughter,Mary. She was a staunch Roman Catholic who earned the title ‘bloody Mary’ forher purge of Protestants. Mary had secured the throne by executing her rival,Lady Jane Grey, the ‘six-day queen’. With Mary’s death came the legendary reignof Elizabeth I, Henry’s daughter by Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth executed her rival,Mary Queen of Scots, from the House of Stuart, and Elizabeth proceeded torestore the Church of England with herself as Supreme Head. She ordered a purgeagainst Catholics which was to earn her the title of ‘bloody Elizabeth’. Nicefamily.It was against this backdrop that Francis Bacon emerged as a very high initiateof the secret knowledge in the reign of his probable mother Elizabeth I, and hersuccessor James I, the Scottish king who united the English and Scottishmonarchy when he was crowned in 1603 as the first king of both countries. It wasBacon, with Robert Fludd, Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, who oversaw thetranslation of the King James version of the Bible, a book which, according to astudy in 1881, has at least 36,191 translation errors. Given that Bacon was anextremely educated and intelligent man, I can’t believe that such a mess couldhave been made of the Bible translation on such a scale unless it was meant thatway. Bacon also removed the two Books of Maccabees from his version which,significantly, were hostile to the secret society called the Nazarenes, aBrotherhood offshoot at the time of the mythical Jesus. Bacon has also beendubbed the ‘father’ of modern science – this-world-is-all-there-is science –which has focused only on the physical level of existence. Why would Baconsupport such a version of ‘science’ when he was an advanced initiate of thesecret knowledge and knew the truth? There’s something seriously not right aboutall this, especially when you consider that other ‘fathers’ of modern sciencelike Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle were also advanced initiates as Grand Mastersof the Priory of Sion. Here you have Bacon, a leading initiate of the secretknowledge, involved, via the Rosicrucians and other networks, in the dividing ofthe Christian Church, the writing of the Christian Bible, and the creation ofmodern ‘science’ which challenged many of the basic foundations of Christianity.He was playing two sides against each other to create an environment in whichanother, unspoken, Agenda could flourish. Certainly this period produced theclassic control system of divide and rule. Mass slaughter erupted across Europein the Protestant-Catholic wars, while, at the same time, both creeds were beingchallenged by the emerging ‘scientific’ dogma.It was also under the influence of Bacon and other esoteric magicians like JohnDee and Sir Francis Walsingham, that the spy networks across Europe, now knownas British Intelligence, were created. British Intelligence was formed by thereptilian bloodlines of the Babylonian Brotherhood and British Intelligencewould later create American Intelligence and similar networks throughout theexpanding British Empire, which are still at work today. The CIA was created byElite members of British Intelligence during the presidency of the 33rd degreeFreemason, Harry S. Truman, the man who officially ordered the bombs to bedropped on Japan. He took his advice from Bill Donovan, the head of the CIA’spredecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was peopled entirelyby Knights Templar according to Bill Cooper, a former operative with US NavalIntelligence. Walsingham was posted as ambassador to France to expand the spynetworks and it was no surprise when a French Intelligence agent told me thatBritish and French Intelligence are the same organisation. It certainly makesthe cover up of Princess Diana’s murder easier. The intelligence agencies of theworld, at their peaks, are esoteric, black magic secret societies working to thesame Agenda – global control. John Dee was the Queen’s astrologer, a RosicrucianGrand Master, a black magician, and a secret agent for the new intelligencenetwork. He appears to have had a copy of the Book of Enoch from some source orother and he, and the psychic Edward Kelley, developed a written language theycalled ‘Enochian script or cipher’ from communications with the angels –reptilians. Dee signed his reports 007 – the same, of course, as James Bond, thestories written by a 20th century agent of this same British Intelligence, IanFleming, a friend of the black magician, Aleister Crowley. Dee travelledthroughout Europe manipulating, gathering information and oiling the networks.One of his haunts was Bohemia and he was closely associated with Emperor RudolfII of the reptilian Habsburg dynasty, another occultist.12[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670708] Dee was among the influentialvoices who were orchestrating a policy of British expansionism which became theBritish Empire. While in Prague, Dee gave Emperor Rudolph an illustratedmanuscript written in code and claimed to be the work of Roger Bacon (Roger, notFrancis), the 13th century Franciscan monk who upset the church authorities withhis views and ideas. These included prophecies about the microscope, telescope,car, submarine, aeroplane and the belief that the Earth was a sphere and notflat. In 1912, this same manuscript was bought by an American book dealer calledWilfred Voynich and became known as the Voynich Manuscript. When he sent copiesto the experts of the day, they said that most of the hundreds of plantsillustrated did not grow on this planet. Some of the illustrations looked liketissue seen under a microscope and others were of star systems andconstellations. The best code breakers available to United States Intelligencein both the First and Second World Wars tried to decipher what they called: “themost mysterious manuscript in the world”, but none of them could do it. WilliamRomaine Newbold, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, claimed to havedecoded some of it in 1921. He said that part of the text read:“In a concave mirror, I saw a star in the form of a snail between the navel ofPegasus, the girdle of Andromeda, and the head of Cassiopeia.”13[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos670826]What is described in the manuscript acquired by Dr John Dee is now known to beaccurate and the illustration it contains of the Andromeda nebula is alsocorrect, but it is depicted from an angle which cannot be seen from Earth! Thismanuscript is just one example of the level of knowledge the Brotherhood wereworking with hundreds of years ago while their other wing, the religions, werekeeping the masses in the most basic ignorance. In this John Dee-Francis Baconcircle were all the leading figures of Elizabethan society, including Sir WalterRaleigh. It may have been Francis Bacon who communicated some of the secretknowledge ‘for those who have ears’ in ciphers and symbolism in the works calledthe Shakespeare plays. He, like the writers of the Old and New Testaments andthe King Arthur ‘Grail’ stories, was a high initiate of the secret mysteriescommunicating through code and hidden meaning. Manly P. Hall says that Baconindicated that he was the true author in a series of codes. His esoteric numberwas 33 and on one page in the first part of the ‘Shakespeare’ play, Henry TheFourth, the name ‘Francis’ appears 33 times. Bacon also used watermarks in paperto transmit his symbols, as did the Rosicrucians and secret societies ingeneral. These included the rose and the cross and bunches of grapes – the vine,the bloodlines.14 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671021] Bacon also usedTarot symbolism in his codes, including the numbers 21, 56 and 78, which arerelated to divisions in the Tarot deck.15[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671157] In a Shakespearean Folio of 1623,the Christian name of Bacon appears 21 times on page 56.16[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671241] The term Rota Mundi frequentlyoccurs in the early manifestos of the Fraternity of the Rose Cross. Rearrangethe letters in Rota and you get Taro, the ancient name for the tarot cards.17[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671325] Shakespeare is known as the Bard. ABard was a Druidic initiate of the secret knowledge and, the Concise OxfordDictionary tells me, there is another definition of bard… “a slice of baconplaced on meat or game before roasting”. The famous Globe Theatre in Londonwhere the plays were performed was built according to the principles of sacredgeometry and the last ‘Shakespeare’ play, The Tempest, included many Rosicrucianconcepts.18 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671409] It is equally possiblethat the ‘Shakespeare’ plays were written by another initiate of Elizabethansociety, Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, who also fitted the bill andsome believe even more so than Bacon. They were both bloodline, almost certainlyRamses-Piso-Bush, and so no wonder the ‘Shakespeare’ plays focussed onBrotherhood themes and bloodlines like Cleopatra and the Scottish King, Macbeth.Brian Desborough, who has extensively researched this subject for a film script,says that De Vere was the head of a team of initiate writers, including Bacon,who put the plays together. One of De Vere’s 5th century ancestors, Richard DeVere, was head of the Royal Court of the Dragon and was known as Lord Draconis!Desborough has established that Edward De Vere fathered a son with QueenElizabeth I, and the child was later known as the Earl of Southampton. De Verewas just 14 when this conception took place and three years earlier, as a childgenius and brilliant writer, he was commissioned by the Queen to write a poemcalled Romeus and Juliet!The idea that the world famous plays were written by an illiterate fromStratford-upon-Avon called William Shakespeare is patently ridiculous and, likeso much accepted ‘truth’, does not survive the most basic research. Shakespeare,the ‘Bard’, grew up in Stratford, a town with no school capable of communicatingsuch a high degree of learning. His parents were illiterate and he showed atotal disregard for study. Yet the plays were written by someone with a greatknowledge of the world which could be gleaned only from a fantastic range ofbooks and personal experience through travel. Shakespeare had no such library,not that he could have used it if he had, and he is never known to have left thecountry. Bacon had just such a library and travelled widely to many of theplaces featured in the plays. So did De Vere. Where did Shakespeare acquire hisknowledge of French, Italian, Spanish, Danish and classic Latin and Greek?Answer, he didn’t. Ben Jonson, a close friend of Shakespeare, said that the‘Bard’ understood: “small Latin and less Greek!”19[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671525] But Bacon and De Vere were learnedin these languages. Shakespeare’s daughter, Judith, was known to be illiterateand could not even write her name at the age of 27.20[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671653] It really makes sense that a manwho wrote so eloquently would have a daughter who could not write her signature.There are only six known examples of Shakespeare’s own handwriting, allsignatures, and three of these are on his will. They reveal a man unfamiliarwith a pen and a hand that was probably guided by another. His will included hissecond best bed and a broad silver gilt bowl, but nothing whatsoever to suggestthat he wrote or owned a single work of literature!21[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671745] Nor is there one authentic portraitof Shakespeare. The differences in the depiction of him by artists confirm thatno-one has any idea what he looked like. Yet the power of conditioning andaccepting the official line attracts millions of people to Stratford from allover the world to see the home of the man who didn’t write the Shakespeareplays! This is only one small example of how the official fairy story called‘history’ is used to control current behaviour and perception. What else inhistory isn’t true? Just about everything. Behind the Shakespeare plays was thehidden hand behind most historical events of significance – the Brotherhoodnetworks. And nothing sums up the attitude of this group better than the wordsof the witches in the play, Macbeth: “Fair is foul and foul is fair.” As ManlyP. Hall, the Freemasonic historian, wrote of Bacon:“He was a Rosicrucian, some have intimated the Rosicrucian. If not actually theIllustrious Father C.R.C. referred to in the Rosicrucian manifestos, he wascertainly a high initiate of the Rosicrucian Order… those enthusiasts who foryears have struggled to identify Sir Francis Bacon as the true “Bard of Avon”might long since have won their case had they emphasised its most importantangle, namely, that Sir Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucian initiate, wrote into theShakespearean plays the secret teachings of the Fraternity of R.C. and the truerituals of the Freemasonic Order, of which order it may be discovered that hewas the actual founder.”22 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671838]The same, however, can be said of Edward De Vere. The rituals and symbols ofFreemasonry can be traced back to ancient Egypt and beyond. In truth, itsknowledge of sacred geometry, numbers and form, go back to before the lastcataclysm. The Dionysiac Artificers or Architects, composed of initiates of theBacchus-Dionysus (Sun) Mysteries whose role it was to design the publicbuildings and monuments, can be traced back at least three thousand years if notmore.23 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos671931] It was thesearchitect-initiates who designed the great buildings of Constantinople, Rhodes,Athens and Rome and it was this same stream who built the temple to the goddessDiana at the world centre for the Diana cult at Ephesus,24[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672025] which is remembered as one of thewonders of the ancient world. The Dionysiac Architects were connected with asecret society called the Ionians (hence the island of Iona in Scotland) whowere apparently the people who commissioned the Temple of Diana. Under othernames, the Dionysian Architects and initiates from the Frater Solomonis mysteryschool also built great Christian Cathedrals funded by the Knights Templar.There were many Rosicrucian and Masonic emblems to be seen in the carvings ofthe Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and numerous depictions of compasses, squaresand building tools before they were destroyed during the French Revolution.25[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672109] The Bacchus-Dionysus architectswere divided into communities headed by Masters and Wardens, just as Freemasonryis today, and they settled in Israel where some researchers link them with theEssenes, the Egyptian sect who produced the Dead Sea Scrolls.26[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672193] Bacchus-Dionysus (two names for thesame deity) was a symbol of the Sun who was said to have been born to a virginon December 25th. The foundation of Freemasonic legend and ‘history’ centres onthe building of the symbolic King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. The Freemasonichero is Hiram Abiff, the ‘son of the widow’ in their folklore. This is moresymbolism. In Egypt, Horus (Tammuz) was the son of the widow, Isis.The creation of Freemasonry in the 16th and 17th centuries pulled together manyof the various themes, agendas and organisations I have highlighted so far. Itconnected the Rosicrucians and Templars in England, like Bacon, with the storyof the Templars after their arrival from France at the time of Philippe theFair, and their subsequent return to France as the Scots Guard. It also connectsthis group with the Priory of Sion. The figure which encapsulated theseconnections was James VI of Scotland (Ramses-Piso-Bush), who succeeded ElizabethI and became James I of England and Scotland. He was the only child of MaryQueen of Scots. The Stuart bloodline with its connections to the reptilianMerovingians (Ramses-Piso-Bush) was now on the throne of both England andScotland. Under James’s patronage, the Scottish and Templar knowledge and theRosicrucian knowledge of Francis Bacon and others could merge and become unitedunder the name, Freemasonry. So could the knowledge of the reptilian House ofLorraine, another bloodline of King James. He had the whole set, this guy. Forthis reason, and others, you find the names ‘James’ and ‘St James’ appear manytimes in the titles of Brotherhood companies, organisations and their locations.The American ambassador to London is known as the Ambassador to the Court of StJames. Close to the Houses of Parliament in London you find St James’s Squareand here is the headquarters of the Conservative Party; the biggest Britishtrade union, the Transport Union; a building owned by the Scottish reptilianbloodline, the Keswicks (of which more later); and in the centre is a massiveround church dedicated to St John (Nimrod).One of his first acts as King James I of England and Scotland (Ramses-Piso-Bush)was to award a knighthood to Bacon, and James would later appoint himSolicitor-General, Attorney-General, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and, in 1618,Lord Chancellor and Baron Verulam. Later Bacon was prosecuted on corruptioncharges and retired from official public life. In those early years under JamesI, there was a wonderful opportunity to circulate the suppressed knowledge ofthe ancient world if that was really the motivation of the James-Bacon esotericunderground. But again we have the contradiction. The very opposite happened.James employed Bacon to edit the King James version of the Bible and launched avicious condemnation of ‘witches and wizards’ – those among the generalpopulation who used and communicated the esoteric knowledge. More than that, heembarked on a vicious slaughter of them, killing thousands, and he even wrote abook explaining how they should be identified and dealt with. Why do that if, asclaimed, the motivation of this underground stream was to protect and eventuallycirculate such information? Because that was never the idea. It helps if peoplewhose support you need think that is your motivation, but when it comes to thecrunch you walk the other way. The hierarchy of the groups I have beenhighlighting don’t want to make the knowledge available, they want to hoard itand use it to gain power on a global scale. To be honest I’m fed up with hearingof how the Freemasons, Templars, Rosicrucians, Bacon and others, have beenprotectors of the knowledge when every time the climate has been right to makeit public, including today, the opportunity is spurned. It’s bullshit. They knowthat knowledge is power if you have it and others do not, so the last thingtheir hierarchy wants is an informed population. Throughout Europe, the wizardsand witches, the sensitives and psychics in other words, were burned, drowned,jailed and tortured, on the orders of people like King James and Martin Luther.Yet these were initiates using the same knowledge the ‘wizards and witches’ wereusing and communicating. There were two esoteric undergrounds and still are. Theone among the people which passed on the knowledge in secret, myth and fairytale, to avoid the wrath of the religious and political establishment; and theBabylonian Brotherhood underground which wanted that knowledge for itself tocontrol and manipulate the religious and political establishment. So thepeoples’ underground was, and is, constantly attacked and pursued by theBrotherhood underground. Some 250,000 were murdered for being ‘wizards andwitches’, 30,000 of them in the British Isles alone.27[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672307] Incidentally, less we miss thefact. The Piso family wrote the Gospel stories and Constantine the Great turnedthem into the religion we know today. Their bloodline became the Merovingianswho were related to James I, the sponsor of the most used version of the Bibleto this day!The Freemasonic movement was to become a sort of central meeting place andcoordinator for the various elements of the Brotherhood network. W. WynnWestcott, founder of the Hermetic (and Satanic) Order of the Golden Dawn, knewthe true background to Freemasonry because of his connections to the esotericunderground. He wrote in his work, The Magical Mason, that the Freemasonsoriginate from the Essenes, the Pharisee (Levite) Jews, the ancient mysteryschools of Egypt and Greece, the Vehm-Gerichte of Westphalia, Germany, the RomanCollegia, the French Compagnons, and the Rosicrucians.28[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672434] The official (and inaccurate) storyis that Freemasonry emerged from the lodges of the stone masons who worked onthe great churches and cathedrals, craftsmen with the knowledge of sacredgeometry. They had enjoyed a close connection with the Knights Templar since thebuilding of the Gothic cathedrals. But by the time of Henry VIII, their work wasin decline. Far from building more cathedrals, Henry set about looting themonasteries and the fraternities, brotherhoods and guilds to raise some muchneeded cash. To survive, the Masonic guilds began to open their doors tonon-Masons, people from the professional classes, the businessmen, merchants,landowners and the aristocracy. It was now freemasonry and, of course, thenewcomers took over the show very quickly, we are told. What happened, in truth,is that the Knights Templar-Rosicrucian-Babylonian Brotherhood underground,created their own initiation structure to pass on the secret knowledge to thechosen few and keep it out of circulation. The mason guilds were simply a coverstory.Freemasonry was born in Scotland among the familiar Brotherhood bloodlinefamilies, especially the reptilian St Clair/Sinclairs. They were based atRosslyn or Roslin Castle just south of Edinburgh in a region steeped in Templartradition. Like all of these bloodline families, they periodically change theirname to hide their origins. This line became the St Clairs while they wereliving in Normandy before they crossed the English Channel with William theConqueror for the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and became the Scottish Sinclairs.Five of the nine St Clairs who took part in the battle were William’s firstcousins and one of them settled in Scotland to found the Scottish dynasty.29[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672546] The family apparently namedthemselves St Clair after a martyred hermit named Clare, or that’s the officialline.30 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672791] They were the Norsemen whocame down from Scandinavia to occupy what they called Normandy, but their trueorigin was with the white races and reptile-Aryans which emerged from the NearEast and the Caucasus. The foundations were laid for Rosslyn Chapel in 1446 andit was completed in the 1480s. It is a mass of esoteric and later Freemasonicsymbolism and it is like a shrine for the Brotherhood. The Sinclairs hadextensive connections to the underground networks in France, Lorraine and Guise,and with Scandinavia, Denmark and the one-time Brotherhood financial centre inVenice. They were steeped in the reptilian network. A Sinclair went ashore inNorth America with the Black Nobility Venetian, Nicolo Zeno, a century beforeChristopher Columbus would do so officially. One of the symbols at RosslynChapel is the Pagan vegetation god or ‘Green Man’. Tim Wallace-Murphy wrote inhis official history of Rosslyn Chapel that the Green Man can be identified withTammuz, the dying and resurrecting god of Babylon and an aspect of Nimrod.Tammuz, and other names for the same deity, was often depicted to have a greenface. This includes Osiris, the husband-brother of Isis. The story of Robin Hoodin his ‘Lincoln green’ originated with this Green Man deity. Robin Hood began inthe original legend as a species of ‘fairy’ and he was also known as GreenRobin, Robin of Greenwood and Robin Goodfellow.31[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672875] His ‘Shakespearean’ version, Puck,in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, presided over fertility and sexual rites at thesummer solstice. On May 1st, May Day, they had the May Pole ceremonies. The MayPole is a phallic symbol dedicated to the goddess of sexuality and fertility andon that day every village virgin would be a Queen of the May (Queen Semiramis).Many would end up in the green wood to undergo a sexual initiation with a youthplaying the role of Robin Hood or Robin Goodfellow. The children that oftenfollowed nine months later were the origin of the now common names Robinson andRobertson.32 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos672993] The story of RobinHood was another symbolic tale to maintain the memory of Pagan sexual ritualamid the crossed legs and scowling faces of orthodox Christianity. A play calledRobin Hood and Little John was performed every May and June at Rosslyn bygypsies or other travelling performers. 33[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673084] Sir William Sinclair became, for atime, a protector of gypsies when legislation was passed in Scotland designed towipe them out. The gypsies originated in Egypt and they carried the knowledgefrom place to place and generation to generation. This is why they have been sopersecuted and hounded until most of their knowledge disappeared.The biggest rite of world Freemasonry are the 33 degrees (initiation levels)called the Scottish Rite. It is named after that little country in the north ofthe British Isles because that is where many of the ancient bloodlines settledto be followed by the Templar knowledge at the time of Philippe the Fair. Nowthe Templars had reemerged publicly under another name – Freemasonry. The othermain stream of the ‘craft’ is the York Rite, after which New York is named,which is the centre of United States Freemasonry to this day. Some researchersbelieve that the Priory of Sion wrested control of the Scottish and York Ritesfrom the Templars who later crossed the English Channel to found FrenchFreemasonry. This may be true, but in the end they are all the same organisationat the highest level. You can still see the influence of the Templars in thedegrees of the York Rite. The top degree is the Knights Templar Degree, followedby the Knights of Malta Degree and the Red Cross Degree. But the officialdegrees are only what they admit to. Above these levels are what I call theIlluminati degrees which very, very few people even know about, never mindreach. The vast majority of Freemasons never progress beyond the bottom threelevels, the ‘blue degrees’, and they are used as a front of respectability tohide the real Agenda which the rank and file are not aware of. Albert Pike wasthe head of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in theUnited States in the last century and is considered a Freemasonic ‘god’ inAmerica. His statue stands in Washington DC. In his Freemasonic book, Morals AndDogma, he writes on page 819:“The blue degrees are, but the outer court or portico of the temple. Part of thesymbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled byfalse interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but itis intended that he shall imagine he understands them.”Put another way, keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit. This is theclassic secret society structure in which only the highest levels know what isreally going on. The rest are sold a myth. In the mid-17th century, the ThirtyYears War between the Protestant and Catholic believers had turned Europe into acauldron of death and mayhem. It was feared at one stage that the new Protestantmovement would be routed and the rule of Rome restored. Britain became a safehaven for the Protestant cause, particularly under the royal house of Stuart,which ironically was not Christian at all. But the split the Protestants createdin the Christian Church, and the way the power of Rome was thus diminished,suited the Brotherhood. The British Isles became the focus for esoteric thoughtin Europe and the creation of Freemasonry wove these strands together in onestructure. Freemasonry was to quickly become a vehicle for political andeconomic manipulation, its members working through all sides to the same end.The Agenda in this period was to diminish the power of the monarchies in Europeand replace them with political systems designed in a way that allowed theBrotherhood to control them. It was based on the structure in ancient Sumer andBabylon and this has continued to this very day. A series of civil wars weretriggered throughout Europe which either removed the monarchy or made them merepuppets. In the English Civil War of 1642–1646, the Stuart king and Freemason,Charles I, was defeated and later executed. The monarchy was briefly overthrownand replaced by a Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, also a Freemason. This maysound strange and contradictory, but it isn’t. The Agenda is the primemotivation, in fact the only motivation, of the Brotherhood. If that meansreplacing a Freemason and a Stuart who won’t follow the Agenda with a Freemasonwho will, then so be it. The end of the royal line for the Stuarts is not assignificant as it would seem. The Brotherhood Elite and the reptilians do notcare who introduces their Agenda, so long as someone does and the mostinfluential of their bloodlines are not always the most famous people. Often themost influential ones work in the background where the real power lies. TheStuarts were fine for a while, but everyone is expendable to the cause and bynow the structures were in place to run countries via the secret societynetworks, using frontmen and women. The power of a single monarch was over andthat was certainly the case in the UK after the beheading of Charles I. Evenwhen the monarchy was restored with Charles II, it was a puppet of theBrotherhood and took orders in the same way that Oliver Cromwell did when, in1655, he allowed ‘Jewish’ (Aryan) people to return to England for the first timesince they were excluded by Edward I in 1290. This was the time when the BlackNobility in Amsterdam were preparing to put their man, William of Orange, on theBritish throne.Everything interconnects with everything else in the most remarkable way becauseit is being coordinated from the lower fourth dimension which can see into thisone. The Christian Church was split into rival and violent factions by theRosicrucian, Martin Luther, and the emergence of a vicious brand of theProtestant faith called Calvinism, later known as the Puritans. Its founder‘John Calvin’ was actually Jean Cauin from Noyons, France, who was educated atthe Brotherhood-controlled, College du Montagu. This is also where IgnatiusLoyola, the ‘Catholic’ founder of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, waseducated. Cauin moved to Paris and then to Geneva, Switzerland, where he wasknown as Cohen. This name relates to ‘priest’ and goes back to the Egyptianmystery schools. In Geneva he developed, or someone else did, the philosophyknown as Calvinism. He changed his name again from Cohen to Calvin to make itmore acceptable to the English who now became the prime target of this newreligion – yet another created by the same source as all the others. Calvinismwas a designer religion for the next stage of the plan. It focused rigidly onthe ten commandments of ‘Moses’ and the Old Testament texts (taken literally,not symbolically of course). But this was the crucial bit. Up to this point theChristian religion had banned usury, the charging of interest on loans. Now,with the Black Nobility bankers manoeuvring to take over England, a Christiancountry, using the outwardly ‘Christian’ aristocracy, the time had come to endthat rule and make usury the norm. Calvinism, therefore, supported the chargingof interest and one of the great beneficiaries was Switzerland, where the plotwas conceived, because it became the centre of the world’s private bankingsystem. Another role for Calvinism was to insist on the burning of witches andin so doing take more of the secret knowledge out of public circulation. TheBlack Nobility wanted their man, William of Orange, on the throne and to do thisthey had to remove Charles I, the guy they eventually beheaded in 1649.Calvinism was used to ferment unrest with the monarchy and along came theFreemason and Calvinist, Oliver Cromwell, to play his part in yet anothermanufactured conflict as his Roundheads met the Royalists in the English CivilWar. On September 3rd 1921, a publication by Lord Alfred Douglas called PlainEnglish presented the contents of correspondence relating to the plot behind themurder of Charles I. It said that volumes of records had been found in theSynagogue of Mulheim by a L. A. Van Valckert. They were written in German andhad been lost since the Napoleonic Wars. An entry for June 6th 1647, from OliverCromwell to an Ebenezer Pratt, says (in modern language):“In return for financial support will advocate admission of Jews to England;this, however, impossible while Charles living. Charles cannot be executedwithout trial, adequate grounds for which at present do not exist. Therefore,advise that Charles be assassinated, but will have nothing to do with procuringan assassin, though willing to help with his escape.”Ebenezer Pratt’s reply was on July 12th 1647:“Will grant financial aid as soon as Charles removed and Jews admitted.Assassination too dangerous. Charles should be given the opportunity to escape.His recapture will then make trial and execution possible. The support will beliberal, but useless to discuss terms until trial commences.”34[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673168]This publication was so revealing that the Brotherhood network had thepublisher, Lord Alfred Douglas, imprisoned on the basis of an alleged ‘libel’printed in his paper about Winston Churchill. How it is possible to libel aSatanist like Churchill is rather hard to comprehend. That correspondencebetween Cromwell and Pratt was mirrored by actual events. On November 12th 1647,Charles I was allowed to escape and in fact was ‘hidden’ on the Isle of Wight,just off the southern coast of England, where I am writing this section. Charleswas recaptured and when he and Parliament appeared to be close to an agreementthat would spare his life, Cromwell, by now Lord Protector, dismissed all themembers supporting an agreement. History calls what remained the ‘RumpParliament’. Another trial was ordered by Cromwell because his agreement withhis backers in Amsterdam was that Charles would be executed. The indictmentagainst Charles was drawn up by Isaac Dorislaus, the agent in England ofManasseh ben Israel, one of the main funders from Amsterdam of the Cromwell‘revolution’.35 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673290] The outcome of the‘trial’ was the public beheading of Charles and this was followed by Cromwellallowing the ‘Jews’ to return to England. I would stress again that we are not,in truth, talking about Jews, but the financial hierarchy of the Black Nobilityand the Brotherhood who hide behind the term ‘Jews’ and mercilessly manipulatethe mass of those who call themselves Jewish. After Cromwell’s death in 1661,many of his Calvinist-Puritan followers headed for America to escape ‘religiouspersecution’ following the reinstatement of the monarchy under Charles II. Thesewere the religious fanatics who slaughtered the Native Americans under thebanner of ‘God’. The Black Nobility bankers in Amsterdam caused a financialdepression in England to undermine Charles II. Eventually a ‘peace’ deal wasstruck between Holland and England in 1667 in which William of Orange (BlackNobility) would marry Mary, daughter of the Duke of York. When Charles II diedin 1685, it was the Duke of York who became King James II. Now all theBrotherhood had to do was remove him from the throne and their guy would be Kingof England. They began to bribe James II’s most influential aristocraticsupporters and the first to bite was John Churchill, the reptilian Duke ofMarlborough. The Commissioner of Public Accounts revealed that Churchill hadtaken bribes totalling some £60,000 (an absolute fortune in those days) fromrepresentatives of Dutch and Spanish financial families like Sir Solomon deMedina and Antonio Machado. Researcher, Euctace Mullins, puts it at more like£350,000.36 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673380]John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, was an ancestor of Britain’s wartime primeminister, Sir Winston Churchill, and the Churchill-Brotherhood connectionscontinue to this day. Sir Winston’s daughter-in-law, Pamela, married theAmerican, Averell Harriman, one of the great Brotherhood manipulators of the20th century and much documented in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free. PamelaHarriman, who had formerly been married to Winston’s son, Randolph, became veryinfluential in the American Democratic Party and is widely named as the forcebehind Bill Clinton’s election as US president. She was rewarded by being madeUS ambassador to the key Brotherhood city of Paris, where she died in 1997 atthe age of 76. Her son, also named Winston, is a British member of Parliamentwho is close to the Rothschilds. Pamela Churchill-Harriman dated Elie deRothschild before marrying Averell Harriman. In 1995 the Churchill family weregiven £12,500 million of National Lottery money when they sold some of SirWinston Churchill’s Second World War speeches to ‘the nation’. The speeches werepurchased with this public money by the National Heritage Memorial Board,chaired by… Lord Jacob Rothschild. Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about.The Churchill-Harrimans are bloodline families. One of Pamela Harriman’sancestors conspired with the Percy family, ancestors of George Bush, in theattempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in the so-called Gun Powder Plot ledby Guy Fawkes on November 5th 1605. As a Harriman, Pamela represented the‘Democratic’ wing of the Brotherhood while the Bush’s, close associates andbusiness partners of the Harrimans, represent the ‘Republican’ wing. Both haveanswered to the same master to ensure that the United States, like every othercountry, is a one-party-state. The Bush family are close friends of theWindsors, which shouldn’t surprise anyone who has read this far because both areshape-shifting reptilians. Bush and his associate, the Brotherhood’s tirelessglobal manipulator, Henry Kissinger, have both been knighted by Queen ElizabethII.The modern version of Freemasonry expanded rapidly from its obscure beginningsamong the Templars and other mystery initiates. The ‘God’ of the Freemasons,incidentally, is a deity they call Jahbulon, as higher initiates will know, butthe lower ones do not. Credo Mutwa, the Zulu Shaman, says that African initiateshave known for centuries that Jahbulon is a name for the leader of thereptilians or Chitauri. The vast majority of Freemasons won’t know this, buttheir secret society is a front for the worship and advancement of reptilianpower. The same with the Templars, out of which the Freemasons came. The GrandLodge of England – the centre of the network – was officially formed on June24th 1717. This is St John the Baptist’s Day, a sacred day for the KnightsTemplar and an obvious connection to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem(Malta). John the Baptist is the patron saint of both the Freemasons and theTemplars because Oannes was another form of John in Babylon and Oannes was aanother name for Nimrod. The Irish Grand Lodge followed some six or seven yearslater. Most of the field lodges which emerged among the regiments in the Britisharmy were warranted by the Irish and not the English Grand Lodge. The Scottishclans introduced Freemasonry to their blood brethren in France and I shouldmention one man in this regard, Andrew Michael Ramsey, a tutor to the ScottishStuart pretender to the throne, Bonnie Prince Charlie. Ramsey was born inScotland in the 1680s and was a close friend of Isaac Newton, the Grand Masterof the Priory of Sion. He was a member of many Elite groupings, including a sortof Rosicrucian society called the Philadelphians (named after the city fromwhere the American War of Independence was orchestrated) and the Frenchchivalric Order of St Lazarus. Many of these Elite groups give their initiatesesoteric names and Ramsey’s Brotherhood name was ‘Chevalier’.37[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673470] He was a significant factor in thespread of Freemasonry and he is particularly remembered in Freemasonic circlesfor two versions of the same speech he made in December 1736 and March 1737. Itbecame known as Ramsey’s Oration and in it he charted some of the history ofFreemasonry. He confirmed that it was derived from the mystery schools ofantiquity which worshipped Diana, Minerva and Isis (Semiramis). He said thatFreemasonry had its origins in the Holy Land at the time of the Crusades (theKnights Templar) and did not originate with stone masons. Ramsey said that ‘ourOrder’ (the Templars) had formed an intimate union with the Knights of St Johnof Jerusalem (Malta) and from that time: “our lodges took the name of Lodges ofSt John”.38 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673588] In France, Freemasonry,with Ramsey’s keen support, spawned a particularly important strand, a fusionbetween Freemasonry and the Jacobite movement which became known as Grand OrientFreemasonry. There are also Grand Orient networks in others countries likeBrazil and Portugal. Grand Orient means Grand East and its rituals are inspiredby the worship of Zoroaster in Persia, Ishtar and Tammuz (Semiramis and Nimrod)in Babylon, Demeter, Persephone and Dionysus in Greece, Aphrodite and Adonis inSyria, Isis and Osiris in Egypt, and Mithra in Persia.39[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673679] The Grand Orient in France was tobe the focus behind the manipulation and coordination of the French Revolution.From the Brotherhood’s point of view, this ‘peoples’ revolution had nothing todo with freedom and everything to do with its Agenda for global control. Thefamous cry of the French revolutionaries: “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”, is aFreemasonic motto.The science of manipulationAs the power of religion began to wane, another mental prison cell was created.We call it, rather bravely, ‘science’. Not real science. Official science, theone that says that this world is all there is and there is no continuation oflife after ‘death’. The Brotherhood had to find an alternative for thoserejecting religion to ensure they would not realise that we are multidimensionalinfinite consciousness incarnate in a physical body for a period of intenseexperience on the road of evolution; that we don’t ‘die’ because we cannot die.Energy is consciousness and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed intoanother expression of itself. When you realise that you are not your physicalbody, but the infinite, eternal consciousness giving life to that body, yourvision of yourself and your potential is expanded beyond measure. What anightmare for those who wish to exert control. So through the Freemasonicnetworks, the Royal Society was formed, yet again in London, under a royalwarrant from Charles II in 1662. It was the world’s first assembly of scientistsand engineers, and it was to be the dominating influence on the direction of‘science’. Virtually all the early members of the Royal Society were Freemasonswho knew that that direction was flawed and untrue. No doubt the same appliestoday. Some familiar names are about to appear again. The ‘father’ of the RoyalSociety, who was said to be its inspiration before he ‘died’ (or movedlocations), was Francis Bacon, the top Rosicrucian, translator of the Bible, andarchitect of Freemasonry. The Royal Society stalwarts also included: IsaacNewton, the Rosicrucian Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, who became a fellowin 1672; Lord Moray, a Scottish Freemason; Elias Ashmole, one of the firstregistered Freemasons; and Andrew Michael ‘Chevalier’ Ramsey, a leading light ofFreemasonry, who was admitted to the Royal Society without any scientificqualifications whatsoever. Another fellow was John Byrom, a Freemason and memberof the Cabala Club, also known as the Sun Club.40[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673791] In 1984, more than 500 of hispapers were found in a house in Manchester and they included information aboutsacred geometry, architecture and cabalistic, Freemasonic and other alchemicaland esoteric symbols.41 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos673907]Ashmole, an alchemist and Rosicrucian with many esoteric contacts in Germany,was a close friend of Charles II and a Knight of the Order of the Garter, thatpremier order of ‘chivalry’ headed by the monarch. He wrote a book with ArthurDee (the son of Dr John Dee), who was personal physician to the Tsar, Ivan theTerrible. When Ivan died, Dee’s manipulation installed the Romanov dynasty onthe Russian throne.42 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674003] Ashmole wasextremely well connected and maintained close contacts with the ‘InvisibleCollege’ which met in Oxford from 1650. Just such a group was proposed byFrancis Bacon in his book, The New Atlantis. This ‘Invisible College’ includedthe famed scientist Robert Boyle, another Grand Master of the Priory of Sion,and Sir Christopher Wren, the architect behind St Paul’s Cathedral in the Cityof London, the financial centre of the Black Nobility and the BabylonianBrotherhood. Both were Grand Masters of the Rosicrucian Order. St Paul’s, andthe rebuilding of the City in general, was made possible by the Great Fire ofLondon in 1666 and how interesting that both Wren, the architect who designed StPaul’s Cathedral on a former site of Diana worship, and Robert Hooke, one ofthree city surveyors after the fire, were both members of the Royal Society andhigh initiates of the secret societies. The new City of London was built to aMasonic street plan with the design of the buildings based on the knowledge ofthe energy grid in that area and how best to manipulate it.The Royal Society was – and is – more than a grouping of scientists. At its coreit is a secret society controlled, indeed created, by the Brotherhood to limitthe vision and breadth of scientific and spiritual understanding. Forconfirmation of that, look at the esoteric initiates behind an organisationwhich denies the esoteric. This becomes even more obvious when you consider thebackground of another group of esoteric initiates who merged into the RoyalSociety. They called themselves the Lunar Society because they met once a monthon the night of the full Moon.43 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674124]Among its members was Benjamin Franklin, the high level Freemason, Rosicrucian,one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, and closely connected to theFreemasons behind the French Revolution. More of him in the next chapter. OtherLunar Society members were Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin,the man who would be used to promote the belief in this world-is-all-there-isscience and the survival of the fittest via natural selection. I don’t thinkthat even Darwin believed that, certainly not at the end of his life, but theimage, the myth, has prevailed. Anyway, the idea that Charles Darwin‘discovered’ the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest isridiculous. His grandfather, Erasmus of the Lunar Society, wrote a book calledZoonomia in 1794 in which he outlined the very same opinion.44[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674378] Josiah Wedgwood of the Wedgwoodpottery empire, was another Lunar Society member and his daughter marriedErasmus Darwin’s son, Robert Darwin, and became the mother of Charles Darwin!45[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674468] This same bloodline produced ThomasMalthus, who’s sickening racist creed has been used by Adolf Hitler, HenryKissinger and endless other frontmen for the Brotherhood to justify the genocideof ‘lesser’ races to maintain the genetic purity of the human blood stock – thereptile Aryans.46 [../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674558] Malthus, anAnglican clergyman, said that disease and appalling living conditions for themasses were essential to stop over-population and the dilution of the master(white) bloodlines. This is just one of his little gems of wisdom:“We are bound in justice and honour formally to disclaim the right of the poorto support. To this end, I should propose a regulation to be made declaring thatno child born… should ever be entitled to parish assistance… The (illegitimate)infant is, comparatively speaking, of little value to society, as others willimmediately supply its place… All children beyond what would be required to keepup the population to this (desired) level, must necessarily perish, unless roombe made for them by the deaths of grown persons.”47[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674652]The economist, John Maynard Keynes, who’s principles have dominated moderneconomic policy, thought Malthus to be a genius and Darwin and his circlebelieved him to be a master of logic.48[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674768] The population control policies ofthis century have been inspired by the genocide principles of Malthus, as Iexpose in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Again the Scottish connectionappears. Six of the members of the Lunar Society were educated in Edinburgh andso was Charles Darwin. Another major voice in the official dismantling of ‘God’and the denial of the eternal soul, was the Frenchman, Rene Descartes, born in1596 and called: “the father of modern philosophy”.49[../Text/index_split_025.html#filepos674880] Descartes was educated by the RomanCatholic branch of the Babylonian Brotherhood, the Jesuits. He called himself aRoman Catholic all his life and yet his books were placed on the Catholic Indexof Forbidden Books. His views would later be expounded by Isaac Newton. Both ofthem were fascinated by the esoteric and alchemy. Here we can see that the sameforce which created the religions of the ancient world, also designed the new‘science’. Who created and sold the idea of a judgmental God and paradise onlyfor believers? The very people who knew it wasn’t true. Who created thematerialist and ‘cosmic accident’ version of ‘science’ that denies the eternalsoul? The very people who knew it wasn’t true. This tradition is continued todayby the movement known as Humanism. Its manifesto, published in 1953, says thatthe universe is self existing and not created; modern science offers the onlyacceptable definition of the universe and human values; and when you die youcease to exist.These two apparent opposites, religion and science, have many things in common,but one in particular. They both deny the true nature of who we are and thepower we have within ourselves to control our destiny. Once we realise that andgrasp the limitless power that is waiting to be tapped, the control of thereptilians and their bloodlines will be no more. The face of the BabylonianBrotherhood has endless interconnected masks, but the creation of Freemasonryprovided a network which could act as a global coordinator for the thousands ofthese ‘masks’ to communicate with each other. Some of the masks operate withinone group or area of society, but most, especially the major ones likeFreemasonry, operate within organisations and groups which appear on the surfaceto be opposed to each other. This has been a means for the same ‘mask’ tomanipulate conflicts and wars, and to direct science, politics and religion toadvance the Agenda.The structure was now in place to press the button on the next stage of theplan.

But the United States hasalways been controlled from London and still is. America has never been the landof the free and it’s time it was.The focus of the world has been on big, bad America, as the global villain whileall the time the events blamed on Americans have been orchestrated by the Eliteof the Babylonian Brotherhood in England and elsewhere. The apparent break up ofthe British Empire and Britain’s decline, on the surface, as the super power,has further obscured, on purpose, where the real power lies. I emphasise that byLondon I do not mean the British Government which is just another facade nomatter who is in office. I mean that for historical and other reasons the majoroperational centre of the secret society web of the reptile Brotherhood is basedin London or New Troy and, to a large extent, Paris, Brussels and Rome, also.Once again, to understand what has happened in the United States we have to goback a very long time. The Phoenicians landed there in ancient times and whatappeared to be Egyptian (Phoenician) or Oriental remains were found in the GrandCanyon in the early years of this century, although the knowledge of this hasbeen suppressed. The naming of the US city of Phoenix in the Valley of the Sunin Arizona was inspired by an understanding of the true history of that area, nomatter what the official version may wish us to believe. There is evidence thatthe Welsh, Irish, English and Scots landed in North America many centuriesbefore Columbus.The official story that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas isludicrous. A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands RosslynChapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of aTemplar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esotericsymbolism. The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s.How remarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions ofsweetcorn and cacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbusdid not ‘discover’ that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, infact, no mystery. Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first whiteperson to land in the Americas. The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons,Basques and Portuguese, all sailed to America before him and so did Prince HenrySinclair of Rosslyn, as documented in a rare book by Frederick J. Pohl calledPrince Henry Sinclair’s Voyage To The New World 1398. Sinclair made the journeywith another Brotherhood bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominentBlack Nobility families in Venice. Sinclair and Antonio Zeno landed in what wecall Newfoundland and went ashore in Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1398.Antonio’s descriptions in his letters of the land they found correspondperfectly, and in detail, with an area of pitch (asphalt) deposits in PictouCounty, Nova Scotia, not far from the present town of New Glasgow. Sinclair wenton to land in what is now New England. In Massachusetts at a place calledProspect Hill at Westford, 25 miles from Boston, a representation of a sword andan armoured knight have been found in the rock. T. C. Lethbridge, the curator ofthe University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Cambridge, England, saidthat the arms, armour and heraldic emblems were those of a late 14th centuryknight, north Scottish, and: “a kin to the first Sinclair, Earl of Orkney”.1[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos743591] The Brotherhood had known about theAmericas for thousands of years and Christopher Columbus was used to make theofficial discovery so that the occupation of the Americas could begin. This isthe story of how it was done.After the purge of 1307, many Templars left France for Scotland, as we haveseen. But others headed for Portugal where they operated under the name, theKnights of Christ, focusing mainly on maritime activities. The most famous GrandMaster of the Knights of Christ was Prince Henry the Navigator (another PrinceHenry) who lived between 1394 and 1460. The term ‘navigator’ or ‘nautonnier’ wasused by the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion to denote a Grand Master andso not surprisingly it was continued by this Templar front, the Knights ofChrist. Prince Henry was a maritime explorer of royal (reptilian) blood and itwas his sailors who ‘discovered’ Madeira and the Azores, two possible remnantsof Atlantis. Because of his connections to the secret Brotherhood knowledge, hehad access to many maps compiled from the journeys of the Phoenicians andothers, including those which charted the existence of the Americas. Only alittle over 20 years after Columbus set sail for the Americas, sorry ‘India’,the Ottoman Turkish Admiral, Piri Reis, drew a map of what the land mass ofAntarctica looked like 300 years before that continent was officiallydiscovered! The accuracy of his map has been confirmed by modern techniques. Howcould he do that? He said he drew the map from earlier ones, the same sourcesavailable to Prince Henry the Navigator and the Knights of Christ – KnightsTemplar. This becomes extremely important when you realise that one of PrinceHenry’s sea captains and a Knight of Christ was the father-in-law of…Christopher Columbus. This guy was not looking for India. He knew where he wasgoing all along. This is why so many maritime explorers and circumnavigators ofthe world, like Vasco de Gama and Amerigo Vespucci, came from Portugal. Also,the later Captain Cook, the ‘discoverer’ of Australia was sponsored andcontrolled by the Brotherhood’s Royal Society in London. As the Freemasonichistorian, Manly P. Hall, has explained, Columbus was connected to the secretsociety network in Genoa and northern Italy, the bastion of the Black NobilityVenetian-Phoenicians and the reptilian crossbreeds. He was at one time employedby Rene d’Anjou (Ramses-Piso-Bush) of the reptilian House of Lorraine, a memberof the Babylonian Brotherhood and a nobleman with endless contacts acrossEurope, including Genoa and Venice. Columbus (real name Colon) was a member of agroup inspired by the beliefs of the poet, Dante, who was a very active Catharand Templar and the flag Columbus flew on his ships on that journey to theAmericas was… the red cross on the white background. Crucial support forColumbus came from two high initiates of the Babylon Brotherhood network,Lorenzo de Medici, one of the most powerful Venetian reptilian families, and theartist Leonardo da Vinci, a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion the secretsociety of the Merovingian line (Ramses-Piso-Bush). He was supported by KingFerdinand of Spain and his wife, Queen Isabella of Castile (bothRamses-Piso-Bush). They were the ones who also instigated the horrific SpanishInquisition which began in 1478 and was not abolished until 1834. This means,you may note, that the SAME bloodline wrote the Gospel stories (Pisos); formedthe structure of the Christian religion based on those stories (Constantine);sponsored the translation of the Bible in what became its main version to thisday (King James Ist); and launched the Spanish Inquisition against anyone whochallenged the Christian version of God, life and history (Ferdinand andIsabella). Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about!Five years after Columbus landed in the Caribbean, an Italian known as JohnCabot set sail from the Templar port of Bristol in the west of England toofficially discover Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and North America. The nameBristol evolved from Barati and was once called Caer Brito. Bristol was a centrefor the Knights Templar and the area of the city today called Temple Meadsrelates to that. Cabot was backed by England’s Henry VII and Cabot’s son,Sebastian, born in Venice, was an explorer and map maker for Henry. Sebastianalso sailed to the Hudson Bay in Canada and led an expedition for the Spanish toSouth America. The Cabots said they were looking for Asia! The expeditions ofthe Spanish to South America and the British and French to North America wereall coordinated by the same source, branches of the Brotherhood. Officialhistory does not connect Cabot with Columbus, but not through lack of evidence.John Cabot’s real name was Giovanni Caboto. He was a naturalised Venetian whocame from Genoa – the very city where Columbus operated from at the same timeCabot was there. Manly P. Hall, a high degree Freemason himself, said that bothwere connected to the same secret societies and ‘Wise Men of the East’. He addsin his book, America’s Assignment With Destiny:“The explorers who opened the New World operated from a master plan and wereagents of re-discovery rather than discoverers. Very little is known about theorigin, lives, characters, and policies of these intrepid adventurers. Althoughthey lived in a century amply provided with historians and biographers, thesesaw fit either to remain silent or to invent plausible accounts withoutsubstance.”2 [../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos743733]Of course they did. They didn’t want the people to know the truth that it wasall a scam and part of the long term Brotherhood Agenda. Over the next fourcenturies the Brotherhood-controlled countries of Europe, particularly Britain,but also including the Dutch, French, Belgians, Spanish, Portuguese, Germans andothers, plundered the planet, taking over the world, in effect, and expanded thereptile-Aryan control as never before. Typical of the mentality and the methodsemployed were those of Hernando Cortes, who led the Spanish takeover of CentralAmerica after Columbus. The native peoples had their own system of measuringtime and they had a date on which they expected the return of their god,Quetzalcoatl, in many ways their version of Jesus. The stories told about Jesusin the Middle East and Europe and those of Quetzalcoatl in Central America werebasically the same because they came from the same source. The date of theexpected second coming of the white god, Quetzalcoatl, was, in European time,1519 and they believed that he would be wearing attire in keeping with hisnickname of the Plumed Serpent. Cortes went ashore in Mexico in 1519 wearingplumed feathers and he even landed close to the spot where Quetzacoatl wasexpected. He was also carrying a cross, again in keeping with the Quetzalcoatllegend. Because of this, the Aztec king, Montezuma, believed, like his people,that Cortes was the long awaited return of their god. This allowed Cortes, withonly 598 men, to gain control of a vast number of people. By the time theyrealised that Cortes was no second coming, it was too late. Enormous slaughterof the native peoples followed and one Spanish historian estimated at least 12million natives of South America alone were killed after the Europeans (Aryansand reptile-Aryans) arrived and an even greater number became slaves. Among theSpanish conquests were the lands of the Incas and the Maya and much of theirknowledge was lost or systematically destroyed. The same happened in NorthAmerica where the Europeans killed untold numbers of Native Americans andvirtually wiped that culture from the face of the Earth. The native peoples ofAfrica, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere suffered a similar fate. CredoMutwa tells in the video The Reptilian Agenda Part Two, how strange tall beings,known as The Beasts of the Terrible Blanket, appeared in Africa in the yearsbefore the white Europeans arrived, and these beings carried the same symbolslater used by Christian missionaries. The Aryans, unknowingly controlled by thereptile-Aryans, took over the world through these British and European empiresand wherever they went the knowledge of life and history (ie, the reptilianinvolvement in human affairs) was stolen or destroyed. One of the most obviousearlier examples of this was the destruction of the great esoteric library atAlexandria in Egypt on the orders of the Romans in the 4th century. Books thatwere not destroyed were hoarded in the Vatican. The contact who has relativesworking at high levels in the Vatican told me how, during his guided tour of theplace, he saw vacuum-sealed vaults under the building which housed thousands ofancient esoteric books. “It was unbelievable”, he said.The first permanent English settlement in what became the United States was atJamestown, Virginia, in the early 17th century. Virginia, it is said, was namedafter Elizabeth I, the completely misnamed ‘virgin queen’. It is far morelikely, however, given the background, that it was named after the virgingoddess of ancient Babylon, Queen Semiramis and her mirror in Egypt, Isis. Manymembers of the Francis Bacon family were among the early settlers and so werethe Puritan-Calvinists in their black clothing and tall hats who treated thenative population, like their own women, with an arrogance and inhumanity beyonddescription. With the settlers, as the Brotherhood expanded their occupation ofthe planet, came the reptilian bloodlines of the European aristocracy androyalty who would become the business leaders, bankers, presidents andadministrators of the new United States. The financial and land ownership ofAmerica was assured from the start with the formation of the Virginia Company,set up by King James I (Ramses-Piso-Bush) in 1606. James knighted Francis Baconand appointed him to many important positions, including Lord Chancellor ofEngland. Under James’s patronage, the Templars, Rosicrucians and other secretsocieties joined forces under one name, Freemasonry. Look at some of the earlymembers of the Virginia Company – Francis Bacon, Earl of Pembroke, Earl ofMontgomery, Earl of Salisbury, Earl of Northampton, and Lord Southampton. All ofthem of Brotherhood (reptilian) bloodlines. The Virginia Company still existsunder other names and it still controls the United States, as I shall explain ina moment.The Freemasons were at the forefront of the change from overt to covert rule byBritain of the North American continent. This transition is known by history asthe American War of Independence. The Brotherhood Agenda for America wasencapsulated in Francis Bacon’s work, The New Atlantis, published in 1607, inwhich an ‘Invisible College’ of élite intellectuals dictated events. One of theleading Freemasons of the British colonies in America was Benjamin Franklin, whois still revered as a Founding Father who believed in freedom for the people.His face can be seen on the $100 note. Even the Christian patriot movement whichhas understood many elements of the global conspiracy, has bought the idea thatFranklin would have been on their side. I beg, most strongly, to disagree.Franklin was an asset of British Intelligence, a Satanist, stalwart of theBabylonian Brotherhood, and sacrificer of children. If Americans are not to losethe plot here they need to take a whole new look at the background andmotivations of many of their Founding Fathers. Franklin was the Henry Kissingerof his day. It was Franklin who, on December 8th 1730, printed the firstdocumented article about Freemasonry in his newspaper, The Pennsylvania Gazette.He officially became a Freemason in February 1731, and was made Provincial GrandMaster of Pennsylvania in 1734. In the same year Franklin printed the firstMasonic book in America and the first recorded American lodge was founded in hisprovince in Philadelphia. Where was the American War of ‘Independence’orchestrated from? Philadelphia and there you will still find the Liberty Bell –symbol of Bel, the Sun god of the Phoenicians and the Aryans. The Phoenicianlanguage is about sound, not spelling, and integral to the secret, symboliclanguage of the reptile-Aryans is the sound of a word. Franklin, who was also aRosicrucian Grand Master, was at the heart of the Brotherhood operation to takeover America and replace overt control from London with covert control, the mosteffective and ongoing form of ruling the masses. I would urge those who thinkthat people like Franklin and many other Founding Fathers were believers infreedom, not to be duped here. If I want you to give me power and support me atan election, am I going to tell you what you want to hear or what I know youdon’t want to hear? Many of the main Founding Fathers, like Franklin andJefferson, were obvious hypocrites who said one thing and did quite another.This is something, of course, that everyone does from time to time, but we aretalking scale here. Jefferson (Ramses-Piso-Bush) wrote that all men are createdequal while keeping 200 black slaves and writing elsewhere that black people aregenetically and intellectually inferior to whites. How do you square thosestatements? You can’t. Franklin, too, kept black slaves while parroting on aboutfreedom.Franklin was the leading Freemason in the very place where the War ofIndependence was organised; he was a member of Freemasonic networks in France,like the Nine Sisters and the San Juan Lodges, which helped to manipulate theFrench Revolution in 1789; he was an initiate of the highly exclusive RoyalLodge of Commanders of the Temple West of Carcassonne; he was also a member ofthe Satanic Hellfire Club with his close friend, the British Chancellor of theExchequer, Sir Francis Dashwood, who was linked to many esoteric groups,including the Druid Universal Bond. Dashwood had a huge cave dug at his WestWycombe (Wicca) estate for their Satanic rituals and sexual ‘magic’ ceremonies.3[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos743975] I will discuss the reasons behindthe obsession with sex ritual in a later chapter. Let me stress again here thatI am not condemning all Druids or the Wiccan traditions, not at all. I ampointing out the malevolent use of this knowledge, which can, and is, used verypositively and lovingly also by people who call themselves Druids and Wiccan.The reason I mention that people were Druids etc, is to confirm that theyunderstood and worked with the esoteric knowledge while condemning it in publicand hiding behind Christianity. Another Hellfire Club member at this time wasFrederick, the Prince of Wales, and so were the Prime Minister, the First Lordof the Admiralty, and the Mayor of the City of London.4[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744275] This was the company kept byBenjamin Franklin, the man who would lead a ‘rebellion’ against the same BritishCrown! In truth he was agent 72 of British Intelligence, the very sameorganisation created by people like Francis Bacon and Dr John Dee during thereign of Elizabeth I. In 1998 excavations under Franklin’s former home at 36Craven Street, near Trafalgar Square in London, found the remains of ten bodies,six of them children, and they have been dated to the time that Franklin livedthere. The cover story appears to be that he and his house mate must have beeninto grave robbing or buying bodies for medical research. Given that Franklinwas a member of a group involved in ritual sacrifice, in line with the ancientrituals of the Babylonian Brotherhood, does anyone seriously believe that? Ohyes, one other thing. It was these two Satanists, Benjamin Franklin and SirFrancis Dashwood, who produced a prayer book which became the basis for theChristian Book of Common Prayer! As Dashwood was also known as Lord leDeSpencer, their work became known as the Franklin-DeSpencer Prayer Book and, inthe United States, it was the Franklin Prayer Book.5[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744364] Franklin was working in bothAmerica and Europe for the Brotherhood Agenda as were other Founding Fathers,and it is no accident that both Franklin and Jefferson were appointed atdifferent times to represent American interests in that key centre, Paris, aswas Sir Francis Bacon as a ‘British’ representative. It was Franklin’s closecontacts with the secret society network in France which led to so many Frenchrevolutionaries and Freemasons, like Lafayette, being involved in the AmericanWar of Independence. His underground contacts also secured the services of theGerman Freemason, Baron von Streuben, who served in the army of Frederick ofPrussia. Streube played a significant role in the war, as, of course, did thehigh degree Freemason, George Washington, the head of the American forces, andthe first President of the United States. Most of his officers were Freemasons,as were the leaders and many of the troops in the British armies.Lord Geoffrey Amherst was Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the War ofIndependence and the man who paid for his commission to become an officer in thefirst place, was Lionel Sackville, the first Duke of Dorset, an associate of theDuke of Wharton. In 1741, Sackville and Wharton became Knights of the Garter,the Elite chivalric order of the British monarch which slots into the other‘knights’ networks like the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta). The symbolof the Knights of the Garter is a red cross on a white shield. Sackville foundedthe Grand Orient network of Freemasonry in Italy which worked with the highlysecretive Carbonari and the Alta Vendita. His sons, George and Charles the Earlof Middlesex, were both very active Freemasons. Charles Sackville formed a lodgein the Black Nobility stronghold of Florence, Italy in 1733 and he cofounded theDilettanti Society with Benjamin Franklin’s friend, Sir Francis Dashwood.Charles Sackville and Dashwood were members of an Elite group of Freemasonsaround Frederick, Prince of Wales, a member of the Hellfire Club. Charles’younger brother, George, became colonel of the 20th Foot Regiment (later theLancashire Fusiliers) and Master of their Freemasonic field lodge. One of thewardens in this lodge was Lieutenant Colonel Edward Cornwallis, another of thetop British Army commanders in the war with the American colonies. Cornwallis,who’s twin brother was Archbishop of Canterbury, was made Governor of NovaScotia in 1750 and formed a Freemasons lodge there. Serving under Cornwallis wasCaptain James Wolf, yet another figure who would play a vital role for theBritish in the War of Independence. In 1751, George Sackville became GrandMaster of the Irish Grand Lodge, the very body to which the field lodges of theBritish Army in the colonies were affiliated. And in 1775, just as the war inAmerica was getting into full swing, this same George Sackville, a close friendof the Black Nobility’s King George III (Ramses-Piso-Bush), was appointedColonial Secretary in charge of the American colonies! This was the same networkto which Benjamin Franklin was connected. In short, the Babylonian Brotherhood,via the Freemasons, controlled and manipulated both sides in the American War ofIndependence, just as they do in every other war.As historians have documented, the British military and naval operation duringthe War of Independence was incredibly inept. It wasn’t that the colonies wonthe war, it was that the British chose to lose it. Now we can see why, and thechannels through which this was made possible. Also, the British regiments wereawash with Freemasonic field lodges which interlocked with their brethren in theAmerican Army. Benjamin Franklin based himself in Paris during the crucialperiod and from there he could communicate easily with the French lodges and theBritish. Paris was also a major centre, and still is, for the British spynetwork. The role of British Postmaster General was traditionally one ofespionage, not least because you had control of all communications. Britainsplit the job between two people, Sir Francis Dashwood, Franklin’s fellowSatanist, and the Earl of Sandwich who, with Dashwood, formed yet another secretsociety called the Order of St Francis. This was another Hellfire Club. The Earlof Sandwich was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in charge of the naval waragainst the American colonies and the Encyclopaedia Britannica says that forcorruption and incapacity, the administration of the Earl of Sandwich was uniquein the history of the British Navy. Equally inept (on purpose) was the commanderof naval operations, Admiral Lord Richard Howe, who had been brought togetherwith Franklin in 1774 by Franklin’s sister, a member of his spy network wholived in England. Howe later admitted publicly that he had not told hissuperiors of his meetings with Franklin. In the three or four years leading upto the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, Franklin spent the summerat Dashwood’s estate in West Wycombe, north of London, where they took part in‘rituals’ in the specially-created caves dug on Dashwood’s orders to provide theappropriate locations for their Satanism. A statue of Harpocrates, the Greek godof secrecy and silence, was to be found on the premises of the Hellfire Clubdepicted with a finger held to his mouth.6[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744454] Statues of Harpocrates were oftenfound at the entrances to temples, caves and other sites where the mysterieswere performed and communicated. It was Dashwood and Franklin, himself a deputyPostmaster General for the Colonies, who coordinated the war from both sides toensure the outcome – the covert control of the new United States by theBabylonian Brotherhood in London. A letter dated June 3rd 1778, written by JohnNorris, an agent of Dashwood, says that he: “Did this day Heliographintelligence from Doctor Franklin in Paris to Wycombe.”7[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744543]The American War of Independence broke out officially in 1775, triggered by theimposition by the British Crown of higher taxation on the colonies to meet thehuge costs of the Seven Years War between Britain and France, anotherBrotherhood-manipulated conflict. The Seven Years War itself began after GeorgeWashington (Ramses-Piso-Bush), then a young military leader in the BritishColonial Army, had apparently ordered the killing of French troops in Ohio. Theseeds of revolution in America were sown when the Brotherhood in London ensuredthat new taxes were introduced and their representatives in the colonies beganto stimulate the rebellion against them. This is a classic technique usedthroughout the ages. The mass of the people stood in the middle with no idea ofwhat was going on, taking everything on face value. Among the American ‘rebels’were the Freemasons, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, who led a rebellion bythe Virginia Assembly in 1769. The situation came to a head with the passing ofthe Tea Act which allowed that Brotherhood operation, the British East IndiaCompany, to unload its surplus tea in the colonies without paying duty. Thisclearly destroyed the market for everyone else. Official history to this daysays that a group of Mohawk Indians boarded a ship called the Dartmouth inBoston Harbour and threw its cargo of tea into the water. This was dubbed: theBoston Tea Party. In fact the ‘rebels’ were not Mohawk Indians, but members ofthe St Andrew’s Freemasons Lodge in Boston dressed up as Indians. They were ledby their junior warden, Paul Revere. This event could not have happened withoutsupport from the British-controlled Colonial Militia who had been detailed toguard the Dartmouth. The captain of one detachment, Edward Proctor, was a memberof… the St Andrew’s Lodge. This lodge was the first in the world to confer a newFreemasonic degree called the Knights Templar Degree. The Grand Master, JosephWarren, was appointed Grand Master of the whole of North America by the GrandLodge of Scotland. Other members of the St Andrew’s Lodge included John Hancock.He would be a leader of the so-called Continental Congress who signed theDeclaration of Independence. At least three members of the St Andrew’s Lodge,including Paul Revere, were members of the ‘loyal nine’, the inner élite of animportant revolutionary group called the Sons of Liberty. It was this groupwhich organised the Boston Tea Party.Much of this information is documented by the Freemasonic historian, Manly P.Hall, who also points out that of the 56 signatories of the American Declarationof Independence, almost 50 were known Freemasons and only one was definitelyknown not to be. And get this. All those who signed the declaration were cousinsand a royal bloodline. On September 3rd 1783, the colonies were recognised as anindependent republic, the United States, in the appropriately named, Treaty ofParis. The new constitution was primarily produced by George Washington(Ramses-Piso-Bush), Benjamin Franklin, Edmund Randolph, Thomas Jefferson(Ramses-Piso-Bush), and John Adams (Ramses-Piso-Bush), at least officially. Mostof the Founding Fathers who were so committed to freedom were, like Franklin andJefferson, keen owners of slaves. Franklin owned slaves for 30 years and soldthem at his general store. He placed an advertisement for a slave in 1733 whichread: “A likely wench about 15 years old, has had the smallpox, been in thecountry above a year, and talks English. Inquire the printer hereof.” GeorgeWashington owned slaves as did other big names in the War of Independence likeJohn Hancock and Patrick Henry. It was Henry who said: “Give me liberty or giveme death.” Unless your face is black, that is. In all, nine presidents wereslave owners and one, Andrew Johnson, placed an advertisement seeking therecapture of a runaway slave and offering an extra ten dollars for every 100lashes the captor gave the slave. Edmund Randolph, a close associate and aide toGeorge Washington, and later Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, wasappointed the first Attorney General and Secretary of State of the UnitedStates. It was Randolph who proposed a system of central government based on thestructure long proposed by the ‘Invisible College’ and the Francis Baconnetwork.Most Americans believe the Constitution was compiled to ensure freedom, but itwas carefully worded to create loopholes through which the Brotherhood Agendacould be ridden. For a start it says that if the President vetoes a bill passedby Congress the legislation goes back to the House of Representatives and theSenate and to override the presidential veto it has to be voted through again bya majority of at least two-thirds in both houses. This means that you only haveto control the President and one third of one house and you stop any legislationbecoming law. What more powerful weapon could you have within a ‘free’ societyto defend your status quo and stop challenges to your power? Patriots believethat the creation of money by the private banks is unconstitutional in theUnited States because the Constitution says that Congress must create thecurrency. But it doesn’t say that. Article One, Section 8, says that: “Congressshall have the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof.” It does notsay (on purpose) that only Congress shall have that power, nor that they have touse that power. Section 10 says that no State shall coin money and that gold andsilver coins shall be the only payment of debts. So paper money must beunconstitutional? No. An area of Maryland was given to the new Congress tocreate the District, not the State, of Columbia for the new federal capitalcalled Washington DC. Within this district is the privately-owned central bankof America, the Federal Reserve, which issues the nations paper currency. TheDistrict of Columbia is effectively isolated from many of clauses in theConstitution which apply to the States. The main Founding Fathers would haveknown that.The first President was George Washington (Ramses-Piso-Bush) who sat in a chairwith a rising Sun carved into the back, an ancient symbol of the Aryan Sunreligion and the Egyptian Son of God, Horus (horizon). He was Grand Master ofthe Freemasons Lodge at Alexandria (named after its Egyptian namesake) nearWashington DC. When he was inaugurated as President on April 30th 1789, the daybefore the major Brotherhood ritual day, May 1st or May Day, the oath was takenby Robert Livingstone, the Grand Master of the New York Grand Lodge. Theceremony was entirely Freemasonic ritual carried out by Freemasons. A GrandProcession included Washington and the officers and initiates of American lodgesin their regalia. Like most of the leading Founding Fathers, Washington was froman English aristocratic bloodline and one of his ancestors was an English knightof the 12th century, the time the Templars were formed, and another was arelative of the Duke of Buckingham who had fought for the Crown in the EnglishCivil War. Washington was only the first example of how the BabylonianBrotherhood based in Britain has used its reptilian bloodlines to rule theUnited States from that day to this. Look at the genealogy of Americanpresidents, leading politicians, banking and business tycoons, military leaders,media owners, government officials, intelligence agency chiefs, etc, etc, andyou will find they come from the same bloodlines which can be charted back tothe British and European royal and aristocratic (reptile-Aryan) families andtheir origins in the Middle and Near East at the time of Sumer, Babylon andEgypt. Two examples: At least 33 of the first 42 presidents of the United Stateshave been related to England’s King Alfred the Great (849–899) and Charlemagne(742–814), the famous monarch of France, and 19 Presidents are related toEngland’s King Edward III (1312–1377), who has a thousand blood connections toPrince Charles (Ramses-Piso-Bush). George Bush and Barbara Bush are both fromthe same British aristocratic line, among others I have noted. They come fromthe Pierce bloodline, which changed its name from Percy after fleeing England inthe wake of the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the English parliament. The Bushesmarried for genetics, as the Eastern Establishment families in the States alwayshave done in line with their fellow reptilian royal and aristocratic bloodrelatives in Europe. Even Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, who ‘opposed’ each other atthe 1996 Presidential election, are distant cousins. They can trace theirancestry to England’s King Henry III (Ramses-Piso-Bush), who reigned from 1216to 1272 during the years of Templar pre-eminence, and US Presidents, WilliamHenry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. This information comes from thepublication, Burkes Peerage, which traces the lineage of royal and aristocraticfamilies. Clinton has far more royal blood than Dole and is directly descendedfrom the same bloodline as the House of Windsor, every Scottish monarch, andKing Robert I of France. This is why he was the Brotherhood’s choice. HaroldBrooks-Baker, the publishing director of Burkes Peerage, said: “The presidentialcandidate with the greatest number of royal genes has always been the victor,without exception, since George Washington”. What an astonishing statistic and‘royal’ genes = reptilian genes. The same tribe which controlled Europe simplyexpanded into the Americas and called it freedom. The United States has neverbeen free of control from London. Indeed, it was the creation of London. Britainand the British Crown has always owned, yes owned, the United States. If you areAmerican and you have not heard this information before, and few have, it mightbe advisable to sit down quietly and have a cup of sweet tea because you are infor quite a shock. In 1604, a group of leading politicians, businessmen,merchants, manufacturers and bankers, met in Greenwich, then in the Englishcounty of Kent, and formed a corporation called the Virginia Company inanticipation of the imminent influx of white Europeans, mostly British at first,into the North American continent. Its main stockholder was the reptilian, KingJames I, and the original charter for the company was completed by April 10th1606. This and later updates to the charter established the following: * The Virginia (Semiramis/Isis) Company comprised of two branches, the London Company and the Plymouth or New England Company. The former was responsible for the first permanent colony in America at Jamestown on May 14th 1607 and the latter were the so-called ‘Pilgrim Fathers’ who arrived at Cape Cod in the ship the Mayflower, in November 1620, and went on to land in Plymouth Harbour on December 21st. The ‘Pilgrims’ of American historical myth were, in fact, members of the second Virginia Company branch called the New England Company. The Pilgrim Society is still a major elite grouping within the Illuminati and their English branch meets at the Savoy Hotel in London. * The Virginia Company owned most of the land of what we now call the USA, and any lands up to 900 miles offshore. This included Bermuda and most of what is now known as the Caribbean Islands. The Virginia Company (the British Crown and the bloodline families) had rights to 50%, yes 50%, of the ore of all gold and silver mined on its lands, plus percentages of other minerals and raw materials, and 5% of all profits from other ventures. These rights, the charters detailed, were to be passed on to all heirs of the owners of the Virginia Company and therefore continue to apply… forever! The controlling members of the Virginia Company who were to enjoy these rights became known as the Treasurer and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London. * After the first 21 years from the formation of the Virginia Company, all ‘duties, imposts, and excises’ paid on trading activities in the colonies had to be paid directly to the British Crown through the Crown treasurer. No trader could export goods out of the colonies without the permission of the British Crown and to do so would involve the seizure of all their goods and the ship or vehicle which carried them. * * The lands of the Virginia Company were granted to the colonies under a Deed of Trust (on lease) and therefore they could not claim ownership of the land. They could pass on the perpetual use of the land to their heirs or sell the perpetual use, but they could never own it. Ownership was retained by the British Crown. * The colonial lands were to be governed by two Colonial Councils, each with 13 members (that number again), but the Kings Council in London had the final say on all decisions. The sitting British monarch also chose the Governor of the American Colonies, who we would today call the President. * The monarch, through his Council for the Colonies, insisted that members of the colonies impose the Christian religion on all the people, including the Native Americans. To use the language of the time… “with all diligence, care and respect, do provide that the true word of God and Christian faith be preached, planted and used, not only within every of the several said colonies and plantations, but also as much as they may amongst the savage people which do or shall adjoin us to them or border upon them, according to the doctrine, rights, and religion, now professed and established within our realm of England.” If the Native Americans did not accept the Christian religion, they would have to be forced to, the Crown insisted. This was the order to destroy the culture and knowledge of the native peoples of North America and also to maintain the white colonists under the vicious yoke of Christian terrorism peddled by the Calvinist-Puritans. It was a free licence to kill, torture and kidnap the native peoples with complete immunity from prosecution. * The criminal courts on the lands of the Virginia Company were to be operated under Admiralty Law, the law of the sea, and the civil courts under common law, the law of the land. This is a crucial point which I will come to in a second.Now, get this. All of the above still applies today! Read those percentages oncemore and let the magnitude of that sink in. After the original 13 (again!)American colonies won their ‘independence’ and an ‘independent’ country wasformed after 1783, the Virginia Company simply changed its name to… the UnitedStates. You see there are two USAs, or rather a USA and a usA. The united statesof America with a lower case ‘u’ and ‘s’ are the lands of the various states.These lands, as we have seen, are still owned by the British Crown as the headof the old Virginia Company, although there is something to add about this in amoment. Then there is the United States, capital ‘U’ and ‘S’ (usually known asThe United States), which is the 68 square miles of land east of the PotomacRiver on which is built the federal capital, Washington DC and the District ofColumbia. It also includes the US protectorates of Guam and Puerto Rico. TheUnited States is not a country, it is a corporation owned by the sameBrotherhood reptilian bloodlines who owned the Virginia Company, because the USAis the Virginia Company! When Americans agree to have a social security numberthe citizens of the united states surrender their sovereignty and agree tobecome franchisees of the United States (the Virginia Company of the BritishCrown). So why do they do it? Because they have no idea that this is what theyare doing. They are led to believe that there is only one United States and theFederal government is the rightful government. There is no law that says thatAmericans must pay federal income tax, but they go on paying because they thinkthey have to. The Brotherhood-controlled Internal Revenue Service operates insuch a terrorist manner that even most of those who know it’s a scam still payup because they are terrified not to. Have a sip of that sweet tea now and takea deep breath because there’s more.This means that all the rights which applied to the owners of the VirginiaCompany to the gold, silver, minerals and duties, mined and paid in America,still apply to the British families who own the United States and the lands ofthe united states of America. Those same percentages have been paid since‘independence’ and are still being paid by the American people via their federalofficials who are, in fact, officials of the Virginia Company – yes, includingthe President. The British Crown owns the lands of the united states and theland and institutions of the United States, including the Internal RevenueService which collects the taxation and the Federal Reserve Board, the privatelyowned ‘central bank’ of America which lends the government money that doesn’texist and charges the taxpayers interest on it. The Federal Reserve Board isowned by the same Brotherhood families in Britain and Europe who own the rest ofAmerica. But here’s yet another twist. Who owns the assets apparently owned bythe Virginia Company? Answer: the Vatican. On October 3rd 1213, King John(Ramses-Piso-Bush), as ‘King of England Corporation Sole’, claimed autonomy overall the sovereign rights of England and assigned them to the Pope, who, as Vicarof Christ, claimed dominion over the whole world. In return, the Pope grantedexecutiveship to the English Crown over all these dominions. In other words, theCrown is the chief executive and the Vatican is the owner, although, of course,the true owner is whoever controls the Vatican. This is why I keep saying thatLondon is the centre of the operational level of the Brotherhood. Even greaterpower lies elsewhere, some of it in the Vatican, and, ultimately, I think, onthe physical level, somewhere under the ground in Tibet and Asia. The people ofAmerica have been bled dry by this scam and continue to be so. Land of the Free?What a joke! And, people of America, your presidents, judges and leadinggovernment officials know this. In turn, it must be stressed, the King Johnagreement with the Pope presumably gave away the sovereignty of England, also.And who controlled King John? The Templars did.When you know what you are looking for, the truth is in your face. I said thatthe Virginia Company and King James I decreed that criminal courts in thecolonies would be controlled by Admiralty Law, the law of the sea. WhatAdmiralty were they talking about? The British Admiralty, of course. When acourt is being run under Admiralty or maritime law, the flag in the court has tohave a gold fringe around it. Look in any criminal court in the United States orthe united states and you will see it has a gold fringe. The same with manyother official buildings. Those ‘American’ criminal courts are being run underBRITISH admiralty law. The Crown and the Brotherhood families of Britain alsocontrol the American criminal courts and the core of that control is with thesecret societies based in Temple Bar in London, the former Templar lands, thecentre of the British legal profession. The Grand Lodge of English Freemasonryis in Great Queen (Isis/Semiramis) Street in London and has controlled mostFreemasonry across the globe since it was formed in 1717. Through this, theBritish reptile-Aryans control the American judges, lawyers, police, and so on,and through other organisations, like the Council on Foreign Relations and theTrilateral Commission, they manipulate the American political system. TheAmerican judges are fully aware that their courtrooms are controlled by BritishAdmiralty Law, but they keep quiet and take the money. The Rockefeller familyare the bloodline branch managers in America for the London headquarters and itis the Rockefellers who, quite provably, decide who is going to be President. Inother words, the London Elite decide. The Queen of England, Prince Philip andthe main members of the British royal family all know this and are helping toorchestrate it. Who is the Grand Master of the English Mother Lodge ofFreemasonry? The Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Kent.But there is also a French connection to this. There usually is with London andParis the main operational centres for the Brotherhood. Many times the Frenchand English wings have battled for supremacy, but they are still, in the end,two sides of the same coin. The French Revolution of 1789 (the year GeorgeWashington became the first US President) was wholly engineered by theFreemasons and their offshoot, the Bavarian Illuminati. The background to allthis is detailed in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free. After the‘revolutionaries’ executed King Louis XVI (Ramses-Piso-Bush) and Queen MarieAntoinette (Ramses-Piso-Bush), her son, Crown Prince Louis, still a toddler, wasplaced under house arrest at the Paris Temple. Two years later he was smuggledout in a laundry basket by his doctor, Dr Naudin. The retarded nephew of theMarquis de Jarjayes was substituted and he died in 1795. The prince was secretlytaken to the Vendee Palace and given sanctuary by Prince Conde. He was latermoved to a fortress on the River Rhine where he lived under the name of Baron deRichemont. He arrived in England in February 1804 with the former royalpaymaster of France, George Payseur, and was protected by King George III(Ramses-Piso-Bush), the monarch at the time of the American War of Independence.The Prince changed his name again to Daniel Payseur while George Payseur becameGeorge Bayshore. King George III gave the prince, now Daniel Payseur(Ramses-Piso-Bush), a ship and awarded George Bayshore 600 acres of land inNorth Carolina. When they arrived in America they were given help by the Boddiefamily, who were related to the British monarchy. Before leaving England, theprince bought shares in the Virginia Company and once in America he acquiredgold mines, including the Gold Hill Mining Company, which he purchased secretlyusing a trustee, George Newman, as his frontman or proxy. With the invention ofthe steam engine, Payseur began to build railroads and leased them to operatingcompanies. He also established the Lancaster Manufacturing Company to producetimber for railroad products and the Lincolnton Iron Company which later locatedin Chicago and formed two subsidiaries, Carnegie Steel and Pullman StandardCompany. To provide fuel for locomotives (or so it was said), the FederalGovernment (the Virginia Company of which Payseur was a shareholder) allocatedall land extending 100 feet either side of the tracks. Much larger areas of landalongside the railroads were also broken up into sections some ten miles squareand half of these were given to Payseur who also bought up many others. Thus heand the railroads owned some of America’s prime real estate. Much of thislegislation is in the 1854 Congressional Record. The Payseurs’ Lancaster Railwaywas, through the Alabama Mineral Company, the controller of Coca Cola, PepsiCola, General Motors, Boeing, Ford and Standard Oil.After the manipulated American Civil War in the 1860s, all railroads and realestate owned by the supporters of the losers, the southern Confederates, wereconfiscated and auctioned off at Wilmington, North Carolina. They were bought bynine trustees of Daniel Payseur at extremely low prices. A deed of trust wassigned in Nashville between the railroad owners and the government establishingthe United States Military Railroad system which granted the developers amonopoly over transport and communications. All these agreements still apply.Payseur’s chief trustee and general manager was a Rothschild relative calledLeroy Springs, formerly Leroy Springstein. It appears that Leroy Springs was ahalf brother to the American President, Abraham Lincoln. A lady called NancyHanks gave birth to a son in 1808 after an affair with Springs’ father. In hiswill his father left a large area of land in Huntsville, Alabama, to a son,Abraham Lincoln. Rumours that Lincoln was a Rothschild would appear to have abasis in fact. In the 1850s Lincoln’s own affair with a daughter of the Germanmonarch Leopold in 1856, produced twin girls, Ella and Emily. One of thedescendants of this line was the billionaire, Howard Hughes. Many of the famousAmerican families who appeared to be powerful in their own right turn out tohave been leg-men for Payseur and the Virginia Company. Andrew Carnegie was ayoung employee at a Payseur steelworks who was used to front another companywhich Payseur called Carnegie Steel. The Vanderbilt family claim that a mansioncalled Biltmore is their country home. Not true. Biltmore was constructed by thePayseur family as a hotel in the 1880s and it was operated by the Payseurtrustees, the Vanderbilts, on a 99 year lease. Another Payseur trustee was J. P.Morgan, one of the most famous industrialists and bankers in American history.He was yet another face behind which those truly in control could hide theextent of their power.Many of the major oil and mineral deposits in the US are on land owned by therailroad companies, and Payseur’s mineral rights were transferred to petrol andmining companies in exchange for a controlling shareholding. Other rights wereleased to timber companies. After Daniel Payseur died in 1860, his fantasticempire was managed by his grandson, Lewis Cass Payseur, and the expansioncontinued apace. In 1872, a Payseur company, the Charleston, Cincinnati andChicago Railroad, established a telegraph company called Western Union. Itformed a subsidiary called AT and T in 1875 and today it is one of America’sbiggest telephone and communication companies. The Charleston, Cincinnati andChicago Railroad company is the parent company for the Federal Reserve, theprivately owned ‘central bank’ of the United States. The Payseur empire(Ramses-Piso-Bush) became heavily involved in banking. Their Bank of Lancasterbecame the North Carolina Bank and then Nationsbank. The biggest bank in Texas,Interfirst, of which George Bush is a director, merged in 1987 with RepublicBank to form First Republic. This was later absorbed by Nationsbank which thenmerged with the Bank of America. These two launder CIA drug money and that’sappropriate because the forerunner to the CIA, the OSS or Office of StrategicServices, was created from the Payseurs’ own security network which was formedby the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad to protect the Military Railroad System.It’s all wheels within wheels, family within family, and Americans have not aclue who really runs their lives and their country. The question is whocontrolled the Payseurs?The Payseur family have now lost control of their empire, but the same reptiliantribe are still at the helm. The Payseur’s principal trustee, Leroy Springs,died in 1931 and his playboy son, Elliot, took over. He volunteered to upgradethe local County Records filing system and removed the records from theLancaster courthouse. When he returned them, hundreds of Payseur land deeds hadbeen reassigned to Elliot Springs, a Rothschild relative. It seems obvious thathe was told exactly what to do to stop the Payseur daughters inheriting theempire. In the early 1950s, Anne, the daughter of Elliot Springs, married a NewJersey organised crime figure called Hugh Close and Close was appointed chairmanof all the Payseur companies stolen by Elliot Springs. Close’s daughter, MrsCrandall Close Bowles, became a director of the Carolina Federal Reserve Bank. Abattle continues for control of the former Payseur holdings, but at the momentit appears they are controlled by the Rothschilds. Some people who think theyown land they have purchased from the railroad companies are going to be verydisappointed. Their deeds are not legal because the land was not the railroadcompanies’ to sell. It was leased from the Payseur empire. In the end, it isowned by the Virginia Company.Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the Brotherhood President of theUnited States during the Second World War, said that nothing ever happens byaccident in politics. If it happens, it is meant to happen. So it is with allthe major events that have advanced the Agenda towards the centralisation ofglobal power, be they wars, economic collapses, assassinations or ‘scandals’ toremove politicians who are not playing the game. The three major wars onAmerican soil have been the war with the native Americans after the whites firstarrived, the War of ‘Independence’ and the Civil War when the states of thesouth sought to withdraw from the union in 1860. We have seen that the wars withthe native Americans and the War of Independence were engineered by theBrotherhood and the same is true of the Civil War also. Leading Freemasons fromall over Europe attended six Masonic festivals in Paris between 1841 and 1845and it was at six secret Supreme Council meetings held under the cover of theseevents that the American Civil War was planned to further impose Masonic,reptile-Aryan, control on America. Lord Palmeston, the British Foreign Secretaryand Prime Minister, and a Grand Patriarch of Freemasonry, was at the heart ofthese conspiracies.8 [../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744660] Two 33rddegree Freemasons of the Scottish Rite were chosen to manipulate the conflict.They were Caleb Cushing, who worked in the north among the unionists, and AlbertPike, the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction of the ScottishRite, who organised the southern rebellion.9[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744886] Ironically, but highlyappropriately, the funding for the southern rebellion was arranged throughLondon Masonic bankers by Cushing, who was operating in the north!10[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos744969] Pike, a Satanist who believed inthe Aryan (reptile-Aryan) Master Race, enlisted the help of Giuseppe Mazzini,the head of the Italian Grand Orient Freemasonry, out of which emerged theinfamous organised crime operation called the Mafia. In 1851, Mazzini started toestablish groups across America which began to campaign against slavery. TheFreemasons used these groups as the cover for the true motivation behind theCivil War. ‘Young America’ lodges were organised to do this and theirheadquarters was at the Cincinnati Lodge No 133. Their main funding came fromthe British Freemasonic banker and Rothschild frontman called George Peabody andhe appointed J. P. Morgan senior to handle the funds in America. Morgan, you’llrecall, was a stooge for Daniel Payseur. See how the same names keep coming upwherever you look.Franklin Pierce (the bloodline of George and Barbara Bush) was elected Presidentin 1853 and Mazzini wrote that: “almost all his nominations are such as wedesired.”11 [../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745059] One of these‘nominations’ was the appointment by Pierce of Caleb Cushing as his AttorneyGeneral. Cushing was controlled by English Freemasonry and connected to theBritish opium trade to China through his ship-owner father and his cousin, JohnPerkins Cushing. Caleb Cushing wrote extensively against slavery and became thearchitect, with Pike, of the Civil War. Pike had been a school principal inCushing’s home town of Newburyport, Massachusetts, but he was living in LittleRock, Arkansas, the later home of Bill Clinton (Ramses-Piso-Bush), when hisMasonic career began to flourish and indeed, soar. A crucial Elite group behindthe Civil War was the Knights of the Golden Circle, again based in Cincinnati,Ohio. One of their number was the infamous outlaw, Jesse James, a 33rd degreeMason assigned by Albert Pike to rob banks in the north to further fund the war.Another Knight of the Golden Circle was the Freemason, General P. T. Beauregard,who started the Civil War with an attack on Fort Sumter in 1861. One of the mostfamous voices against slavery was John Brown, who became a legend through thesong about ‘John Brown’s body’. Brown, in fact, was a member of a number ofsecret societies, including the Freemasons. He became a Master Mason at theHudson Lodge No 68 in Hudson, Ohio, on May 11th 1824,12[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745246] and was a member of Mazzini’s YoungAmerica. Brown was funded by the John Jacob Astor family, another Brotherhoodreptilian bloodline. With the Freemasons whipping up agitation on both sides inclassic fashion, the Civil War was about to break out. In November 1856, theFreemason, James Buchanan, was elected President and appointed Freemason, JohnB. Floyd, as his Secretary of War. The Vice President was John C. Breckinridge,of Kentucky, who received the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite from Albert Pikeon March 28th 1860. The President of the rebel or Confederate States of thesouth was the Freemason, Jefferson Davis, and the first state to withdraw fromthe Union was South Carolina, the headquarters of Pike’s Southern Jurisdictionof the Scottish Rite. Freemasons were at the head of all the other states whofollowed. Significantly, only eleven states seceded from the Union, but theConfederate flag had 13 stars, a sacred number to the Freemasons and the KnightsTemplar.When Abraham Lincoln became President of the Northern Unionists on March 4th1861, he was offered financial backing for the war by the same people who werefunding the south, the Masonic bankers of London. There was one catch, however.Lincoln had to agree to introduce a privately-owned ‘central bank’ of America.One of the main reasons for the Civil War was to bankrupt America to the pointwhere it would have to agree to allow the creation of the central bank togenerate the funds needed to fight the war. But Lincoln refused and introduced amost obvious policy and one which any government today could follow if they werenot all controlled by the bankers. Lincoln simply printed his own interest-freemoney called ‘greenbacks’ and used them to finance the government. PresidentJohn F. Kennedy embarked on a similar policy. This is the Brotherhood bankersworst nightmare and Lincoln was assassinated on April 14th 1865, just as Kennedywas assassinated on November 22nd 1963. Lincoln’s assassin was John WilkesBooth, a 33rd degree Freemason, and a member of Mazzini’s Young America.13[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745360] He was selected by the Knights ofthe Golden Circle who were themselves funded by the London Freemasonic bankers.(One researcher claims the fatal shot was fired by Lincoln's opium-addictedwife, Mary Todd, and Booth framed for the murder. On the evidence I have read Iwould not dismiss that.)The cover up of the assassination, whoever the true culprit, was headed by theFreemason, Edwin Stanton, who ordered blockades of all the roads out ofWashington DC, except for the one that Booth used to escape. Alongside this roada drunk of similar appearance and build to Booth was murdered and his bodyburned in a barn. Who officially ‘found’ this man? Only Edwin Stanton who, ofcourse, identified him immediately as Booth.14[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745450] At the conspiracy trial intoLincoln’s death in Indianapolis in June 1865, some of the people named asdirectly involved were: Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister and 33rddegree Freemason who died in that same year; John Wilkes Booth, 33rd degreeFreemason; Judah P. Benjamin, the voice of the London Freemason bankers whoordered the assassination; and Jacob Thompson, a former Secretary for theInterior, who withdrew $180,000 from the Bank of Montreal in Canada to bankrollthe operation. The Knights of the Golden Circle were also exposed and AlbertPike decided to change their name. He called them… the Ku Klux Klan, thewhite-robed Satanists who have terrorised the black peoples of America. Theirname was taken from the Greek word, kuklos, meaning ‘circle’.15[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745534] Pike was born in Boston in 1809 andeducated at Harvard University. He became Grand Commander of AmericanFreemasonry and Grand Master of the Scottish Rite Lodge at Little Rock,Arkansas, later the lodge of one Bill Clinton. When Pike died in 1891 inWashington DC, his funeral was held in the Freemasonic Temple at midnight withthe room draped entirely in black.16[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745624] This man was a Satanist through andthrough. He is a Freemasonic ‘god’ and his statue stands near the Washingtonpolice headquarters, a short walk from Capitol Hill.Before Lincoln died, the Freemason-controlled Congress had passed the NationalBanking Act of 1863 which created a federally chartered national bank with thepower to issue US bank notes. These were notes lent to the government atinterest by the Masonic bankers. The bankers had survived the greenbacks and thearchitect of that bill, Lincoln’s Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase,was such a hero that the Freemasons named one of their banks after him, theChase Bank, now the Chase Manhattan, controlled by David Rockefeller. I thinkyou will have seen by now that the great events which have divided humanity andcaused constant conflict, be they wars, religions, whatever, come back to thesame source and the same Agenda. What’s more they interweave between the samepeople in a most remarkable way.In the story I have just told of the creation of the United States, you alsofind a connection to the conflict in Northern Ireland. It involves a naturalistand chemist called Dr Edward Bancroft, a close friend of Benjamin Franklin, whohad sponsored Bancroft’s Fellowship of the Brotherhood ‘science’ front inLondon, the Royal Society.17 [../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745742] Laterhe became private secretary to Franklin in Paris, a centre of the Brotherhood’sspy network, and joined the Elite Neuf Soeurs Lodge while Franklin was its GrandMaster. Bancroft led a secret mission to Ireland in 1779 and a year later LordStormont, the British Ambassador to France, informed the king that a secretIrish delegation had been to Paris to see King Louis XVI to propose anindependent Ireland. The ambassador said that: “the delegates are all connectedwith Franklin…”18 [../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos745826] In the years thatfollowed a Brotherhood secret society called the Society of United Irishmen wasformed which involved people like Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone.19[../Text/index_split_027.html#filepos746036] This was behind the Irishrebellions of 1798 and 1803 and the conflict thus triggered has continued inIreland ever since. You find the Brotherhood involved in all the major worldevents in history. Simon Bolivar, known as the founder of Bolivia in SouthAmerica and the liberator of Venezuela, New Granada, Equador and Peru, was amember of the Cadiz Freemasons Lodge in Spain and a master in the Nine SistersLodge in Paris.

The most important of these, in terms of control, isbanking. The creation and manipulation of money.The Brotherhood financial sting is very simple and spans the period we aredocumenting from the time of Sumer and Babylon to the present day. It is basedon creating money that doesn’t exist and lending it to people and businesses inreturn for interest. This creates enormous debt for governments, businesses andthe general population, and you therefore control them. Vital to this has beento allow bankers to lend money they do not have. It works like this. If you orme have a million pounds, we can lend a million pounds. Very simple. But if abank has a million pounds it can lend ten times that and more, and chargeinterest on it. If even a fraction of the people who theoretically have ‘money’deposited in the banks went today to remove it, the banks would slam the doorsin half an hour because they do not have it. Money in the bank is a myth,another confidence trick. When you go into a bank and ask for a loan, the bankdoes not print a single new note nor mint a single new coin. It merely types theamount of the loan into your account. From that moment you are paying interestto the bank on what is no more than figures typed on a screen. However, if youfail to pay back that non-existent loan, the bank can come along and quitelegally take your wealth that does exist, your home, land, car, and possessions,to the estimated value of whatever figure was typed onto that screen. More thanthat, because money is not brought into circulation by governments, but byprivate banks making loans to customers, the banks control how much money is incirculation. The more loans they choose to make, the more money is incirculation. What is the difference between an economic boom (prosperity) and aneconomic depression (poverty)? One thing only: the amount of money incirculation. That’s all. And, through this system, the private banks, controlledby the same people, decide how much money will be in circulation. They cancreate booms and busts at will. The same with the stock-markets where these guysare moving trillions of dollars a day around the financial and banking markets,so deciding if they go up or down, soar or crash. Stock-market crashes don’tjust happen, they are made to happen.Most of the ‘money’ in circulation is not physical money, cash and coins. It isrepresented as figures passing from one computer account to anotherelectronically via money transfers, credit cards and cheque books. The moremoney, electronic or otherwise, that is in circulation, the more economicactivity can take place and therefore the more products are bought and sold, themore income people have, and the more jobs are available. But a constant themeof the reptile-Aryan financial coup has been to create a boom by making lots ofloans and then pull the plug. Overpaid economists and economic correspondents,most of whom have no idea what is going on, will tell you that boom and bust ispart of some natural ‘economic cycle’. What claptrap. It is systematicmanipulation by the Brotherhood to steal the real wealth of the world. During aboom many people get themselves into even more debt. The vibrant economicactivity means that businesses borrow more for new technology to increaseproduction to meet demand. People borrow more to buy a bigger house and a new,more expensive car, because they are so confident about their economic future.Then, at the most opportune moment, the major bankers, coordinated by the secretsociety networks, raise interest rates to suppress the demand for loans and theybegin to call in loans already outstanding. They ensure they make far fewerloans than before. This has the affect of taking units of exchange (money in itsvarious forms) out of circulation. This suppresses demand for products and leadsto fewer jobs because there is not enough money in circulation to generate thenecessary economic activity. So people and businesses can no longer earn enoughto repay their loans and they go bankrupt. The banks then take over their realwealth, their business, home, land, car and possessions in return fornon-repayment of a loan that was never more than figures typed on a screen. Thishas been going on in cycles over thousands of years, especially the last fewcenturies, and the real wealth of the world has been sucked out of thepopulation and into the hands of those who control the banking system – thereptilian bloodlines. The same applies to countries. Instead of creating theirown interest free money, governments borrow it from the private banking carteland pay back both the interest and the capital by taxation of the people.Fantastic amounts of the money you pay in taxes go straight to the private banksto pay back loans which the governments could create themselves interest-free!!Why don’t they do it? Because the Brotherhood controls the governments as muchas they control the banks.What we call ‘privatisation’ is the selling off of state assets to stave offbankruptcy caused by the bank-created debt. Third World countries are handingover control of their land and resources to the international bankers becausethey cannot pay back the vast loans made, on purpose, by the banks to ensnarethem in this very situation. The world does not have to be in poverty andconflict, it is manipulated to be that way because it serves the Agenda. TheKnights Templar used the system I’ve just described when they created thefoundations of the modern banking network back in the 12th and 13th centuriesand this clearly connected with the Venetian network of the Black Nobilityoperating at the same time. The world financial manipulation is todaycoordinated by ‘central banks’ in each country which appear to be workingindependently, but are in fact working together to a common end. The Bank ofEngland, chartered by the Black Nobility’s William of Orange, has been thespider at the centre of this web and so, too, since the 1930s, has the Bank ofInternational Settlements in Switzerland. Like the Bank of England, the centralbanks were chartered by the descendants of the reptilian banking families ofGenoa and Venice.The RothschildsOne bloodline which came from the reptile-Aryans within the Khazar empire in theCaucasus Mountains is the Rothschilds. Their leading members are reptile fullbloods, reptilians knowingly occupying a human physical form. Insiders say thatthe Rothschilds secretly claim that their bloodline goes back to Nimrod inBabylon. I have no doubt that they will connect to the Ramses-Piso-Bushbloodline. No overview of the financial manipulation is possible withoutconsiderable mention of the Rothschild gang. They changed their name from Bauerto Rothschild and, from their base in 18th century Frankfurt, they have been atthe heart of the manipulation of the world to this day. I document theRothschilds at length in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, but I will brieflysummarise here because they are so important to the story. The Rothschildbanking dynasty was created by Mayer Amschel Bauer. The reptilian familieschange their names to hide their origins and their use and creation of titleshas been a great help in this. Bauer changed his name to Rothschild which camefrom the red shield (rotes schild in German) which hung over the door of hishouse in Frankfurt. Red has been the colour symbolising revolution since theancient origins of the Brotherhood, which is why the Russian revolutionarieswere called the Reds. On the shield was a hexagram, a Star of David or Seal ofSolomon and this same symbol is now on the flag of Israel. People think it is aJewish symbol because of its name and use, but this is nonsense. One was foundon the floor of a 1,200 year old Muslim mosque which stood on the site ofpresent day Tel Aviv.1 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos793668] The Jewishwriter, O. J. Graham, in her work, The Six Pointed Star, says:“…the six pointed star made its way from Egyptian Pagan rituals of worship, tothe goddess Ashteroth and Moloch… then it progressed through the magic arts,witchcraft, (including Arab magicians, Druids and Satanists)… through the Cabalato Isaac Luria, a Cabalist in the 16th century, to Mayer Amschel Bauer, whochanged his name to this symbol, to Zionism, to the Knesset (parliament) of thenew State of Israel, to the flag of Israel, and its medical organisation,equivalent to the Red Cross.”2 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos793834]So the very name Rothschild comes from an ancient esoteric symbol connected toEgypt as Moloch (Nimrod) the ‘god’ of sacrifice. The hexagram only became usedby the Jewish hierarchy as their symbol with the emergence of the Rothschildsand it has absolutely nothing to do with ‘King David’ as the Jewish leaders wellknow. It is on the flag of Israel because Israel is not the land of the Jews, itis the land of the Rothschilds and those who dictate to them from even higher upthe Brotherhood pyramid. They created Israel and they control it. The red shieldused as the emblem of the Salvation Army was inspired by the Rothschilds, by theway.Frankfurt, the home of the Rothschild dynasty, was where paper money becamepopular and the new European Central Bank is based there. This bank allows a fewunelected bankers to set the interest rates for all the European Union countriesusing the single European currency. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild is quoted tohave said: “Give me control over a nation’s currency and I don’t care who makesthe laws.”3 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794084] Mayer Rothschildmarried Gutele Schnaper, then 16, and they had ten children, five boys and fivegirls, who were sent out to establish branches of the dynasty in London, Paris,Vienna, Berlin and Naples. The Rothschild children were married by arrangementto noble families and to each other at cousin level to maintain the reptilianbloodline and keep the power ‘in house’. Mayer’s will specifically insisted onthis and also that Rothschild men must always head the business and accountsmust be kept strictly secret. The will excluded Rothschild daughters, theirhusbands and heirs, from the business and all knowledge of it. So just becauseyour name might be Rothschild does not mean you are a Satanist or know what isgoing on. I am talking about those at the top of this empire and the sameapplies to all the families I mention. Most members of these families will beshocked to find what has been going on around them. What we do not want is awitch-hunt against everyone who carries these family names or the reptile racein general. It is those knowingly responsible we need to expose, not theinnocent puppets who happen to be in the same family or have the same name.Mayer Rothschild became banker and manipulator to Prince William IX ofHesse-Hanau (Ramses-Piso-Bush), another member of the Black Nobility reptilianbloodline, and they attended Freemason meetings together. According to the book,Jews And Freemasons In Europe (1723–1939), William’s younger brother, Karl, wasaccepted as the head of German Freemasons and members of the Hesse dynasty wereclosely involved with an Elite Freemason group called the Strict Observance.This was later called the Beneficent Knights of the Holy City,4[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794389] and was known in Germany as TheBrethren of John the Baptist (a code for Nimrod).5[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794504] The House of Hesse were on Hitler’sside in the Second World War and Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger betweenHitler and Mussolini.6 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794629] After theytook the British throne William and Rothschild made a fortune hiring Hessetroops to the German Hanoverians. Many of the troops who fought for ‘Britain’ inthe American War of Independence were William’s German mercenaries. William wasthe grandson of the Hanoverian king of England, George II, and is therefore anancestor of Queen Elizabeth II. By another line, he is also related to herhusband, Prince Philip (Ramses-Piso-Bush). Goodness knows how many of thereptilian Hesse bloodline are out there, because William alone is estimated tohave fathered at least 70, yes 70, children by various women.7[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794712] How did he find the time? But thisis another important point. The reptile-Aryan offspring produced through thearranged marriages are the official heirs. But literally thousands are producedunofficially outside of marriage and these are not credited to that bloodline.However, they are carefully documented and the Brotherhood know exactly whothese people are. They want to know which are the reptile bloodlines becausethey know they will be easiest to ‘plug in’ to the reptilians on the lowerfourth dimension. This is one reason for the highly detailed genetic recordskept by the Mormons, another Brotherhood operation at its top level. So whenpeople in power appear to have no blood links with these families, the oppositemay be true. A number of researchers believe Bill Clinton to be a closetRockefeller and he is certainly blood-related to the British monarchy, everyScottish monarch, and King Robert I of France. St Germain, now a ‘messiah’figure to many New Agers, was a friend of William of Hesse-Hanau, and hisbrother, Karl. Apparently, Karl wrote that Germain, an alchemist and magician,had been raised by the de Medici (Black Nobility) family in Italy.8[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794795] Many New Agers today talk about theGreat White Brotherhood of ‘master souls’, including Germain, who arecommunicating ‘guidance’ to channellers about the coming transformation. This isyet another mind control operation by the Brotherhood to misdirect and imprisonthe more extreme of the New Age mentality and to stop it getting off itscollective arse (and the ceiling) and so making a real difference.Political unrest caused by Napoleon Bonaparte made William of Hesse-Hanau takeflight to Denmark for a while, and during this time Mayer Rothschild’s eldestson, Nathan, another Freemason like most of them, stole £600,000 which shouldhave been used to pay the mercenary soldiers. He took it to London to establisha Rothschild bank there. The fortune he made from this by funding Wellington’swar with Napoleon and other manipulated ‘investments’ formed the foundation ofthe dynasty. Both Wellington and Napoleon were manipulated and funded by thesame people who included Napoleon’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, a FreemasonicGrand Master. The Rothschilds, even according to some of their own histories,constantly funded both sides in wars. They engineered these wars through thesecret society network and their own intelligence operation which continuestoday. It is called Mossad which is officially the intelligence agency ofIsrael, but Israel is Roth-rael and so Mossad is Roth-ad. The Rothschild familysymbol, the hexagram or ‘Star of David’, became the symbol of the Israeli flag.What a surprise. Anka Muhlstein, the Jewish author of Baron James, The Rise OfThe French Rothschilds, says the family intelligence network used Hebrew lettersas a code. Hebrew was the sacred language of the Egyptian mystery schools, whichis where much Brotherhood knowledge came from, along with the ancient knowledgeof Asia and the Far East, which is also connected with the Khazar bloodlines.The Rothschild communications network was faster than any government system andone of the famous examples of Rothschild double-dealing was when they spread arumour that Wellington had lost to Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.This caused a crash on the London stock-market and the Rothschilds secretlybought up stock at knockdown prices. When the news arrived that in factWellington had won, the stocks rose in price again and the Rothschilds hadincreased their wealth by an incredible amount. When, like the Rothschilds, youcontrol the media, the politicians, and the stock-market, making money ischild’s play and so is starting wars. Every working day, the world price of goldis still set at the London offices of N. M. Rothschild and the stock-marketsacross the world are controlled by the Babylonian Brotherhood through bankingand financial families like the Rothschilds. If there is a banking andstock-market crash in the Far East, it is because it suits the reptilian Agenda.Another of their cycles is to encourage people to invest in the stock-marketuntil the quoted companies are massively overvalued. The Brotherhood then crashthe markets (having sold their stocks just before) and while most people losetheir money, the Brotherhood buy up vast amounts of stock at bargain prices. Thestock-market goes up, so does the value of the newly acquired companies, and theBrotherhood wealth and control takes another leap forward. It’s all manipulationto achieve the reptilian goal of total global control.Creating wars is a wonderful way to make vast fortunes and destroy the statusquo. You lend money to both sides to fund the war and then you lend them evenmore to rebuild their devastated countries. They get in debt (control) to youand you increase your wealth (power). Such control and power allows you to builda new society in the image of your agenda, when the war you have created andfunded has destroyed the old structure. The so-called Protocols of the Elders ofZion were discovered in the last century and tell in incredible detail theevents and methods of manipulation we have seen manifest in the 20th century.These documents were very much the creation of the Rothschilds and thereptile-Aryans. But they are not really the Protocols of the Elders of Zion,they are, in truth, the Protocols of SION, the Sun, and the Priory of Sion. Somuch disinformation and aggression has been hurled at the Protocols and anyonewho has mentioned them – including me – because the Brotherhood are desperate todiscredit their contents. It is far too close to home. Hitler used the Protocolsin part to justify the oppression of Jews, but he was given the Protocols by aRothschild agent of Khazar decent called Alfred Rosenberg. I don’t accept thatthe Protocols are ‘Jewish’ in the way people have come to understand that term.They are the work of the reptile-Aryans and made to appear ‘Jewish’ so that welose the plot. See …And The Truth Shall Set You Free for more details of thisand The Robot’s Rebellion for the contents of the Protocols.The Rothschild’s became one of the pivotal families in the Brotherhood’sfinancial and political Agenda and they went on to direct events throughoutEurope before expanding into the Americas, South Africa and eventually theworld. They had the crown heads of Europe in debt to them and this included theBlack Nobility reptilian dynasty, the Habsburgs, who ruled the Holy Roman Empirefor 600 years. The Rothschilds also took control of the Bank of England. Ifthere was a war, the Rothschilds were behind the scenes, creating the conflictand funding both sides. The Rothschild leaders are not Jewish, they arereptilians who have sent countless Jews to their deaths to further theirsickening ambitions. They have been close associates of the House of Windsor andthey controlled people like Edward VII, the Grand Master of English Freemasonry.Edward (Ramses-Piso-Bush) was the son of Queen Victoria and the GermanFreemason, Prince Albert. The Mountbattens (formerly the German Battenbergs) areblood relatives of the Rothschilds and Lord Louis Mountbatten arranged themarriage of Queen Elizabeth II to his grandson, Prince Philip, two equal strandsof the reptilian Black Nobility. Mountbatten was also the mentor of PrinceCharles. All these people are of the Ramses-Piso-Bush bloodline. When victims ofSatanic ritual abuse tell me that the late Lord Mountbattan was among theirabusers, it fits the picture completely. That’s the background he came from. TheRothschilds and the Bauers (also Bowers) are steeped in Satanism and both theRothschilds and the Windsor-Mountbattens are reptilian, Anunnaki bloodlines. TheBauers, particularly a man called Richard Bauer, were leading alchemists andesoteric magicians in Germany in the Middle Ages.9[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794878] Karl Marx, the Brotherhood frontmanfor the creation of Communism, was a student of a Bruno Bauer at BerlinUniversity and this Bauer was the only Bible scholar on record who openly wrotethat the New Testament was a synthesis of ideas between Seneca and Josephus(Piso).10 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos794968] He said that Jesus wasthe creation of the writer of Mark’s Gospel.11[../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos795154] Yet more evidence that thebloodlines of the Brotherhood have known the truth all along.The Rothschilds were involved in the Tugenbund League (also the Virtue League)which was formed in 1786 as a ‘sex society’. Its members, and their wives anddaughters, would meet at the home of a woman called Henrietta Herz and take partin sexual activity and rituals. Among them were two daughters of MosesMendelssohn, a Rothschild agent behind the manipulation of the FrenchRevolution; the Marquis de Mirabeau, the Freemason also intimately involved inthe revolution; and Frederick von Gentz, who would become a very influentialRothschild agent.12 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos795324] In 1807, therefollowed the second Tugenbund League, again involving the Rothschilds. It wasformed by Baron von Stein and expanded rapidly to include most leadingpoliticians in Germany and many of the top military leaders and professors ofliterature and science. William of Hesse-Cassal was a member and the officialrole of this second Tugenbund League was to remove the Napoleonic occupation ofGermany.13 [../Text/index_split_029.html#filepos795450] It was close to otherMasonic groups like the Black Knights, the Knights of the Queen of Prussia andthe Concordists. These were offshoots of the ancient Teutonic Knights structurein Germany and the predecessors of the Thule Society, the Edelweiss Society, andVril Society, which were to be the architects of the Nazi Party. It is the sameface with different masks and the Rothschilds have been behind most of them –including the Nazis. All these groups interlock if you dig deep enough.This apparently complex (but ultimately simple) network of banking, business,politics, media, and secret societies, controls the world on behalf of theBrotherhood operational headquarters in London. The control of money and bankingvia the Rothschilds and others are crucial to this. One of the Brotherhood’smost important coups was the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve, theso-called ‘central bank’ of the United States. It is neither federal nor has anyreserve. It is a cartel of private banks owned by the 20 founding families,mostly European, which today decides the interest rates for the United Statesand lends non-existent money (figures on a screen) to the US Government on whichthe taxpayers have to pay interest. This is what we call the ‘American Deficit’– it is fresh air. The Federal Government of the United States does not own asingle share in the Federal Reserve and American citizens cannot purchase them.Profits exceed $150 billion a year and the Federal Reserve has not once in allits history published audited accounts. This income is assured because 1 theBrotherhood control the US Government (the Virginia Company under another name)which continues to borrow ‘money’ from the ‘Fed’; 2 they also control theprivately-owned Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the illegal terroristorganisation which collects the taxation from the people; and 3 it controls themedia to ensure that people never find out about 1 and 2.The Brotherhood had long desired a privately-owned ‘central bank’ in America tocomplete their control of the economy. When the leading Freemason, GeorgeWashington (Ramses-Piso-Bush), became the first president he appointed aBrotherhood yes-man called Alexander Hamilton as his Secretary of the Treasury.Hamilton introduced the Bank of the United States, a privately owned centralbank which began to lend money to the new US Government so creating control bydebt from the very start. Look at what happened when the Black Nobilityintroduced the Bank of England, and the scenario is exactly the same. The Bankof the United States caused so much poverty, bankruptcy and rebellion, that itwas eventually closed down, but soon after that came its replacement, theFederal Reserve. The Rothschild’s main banking operation in America in the earlypart of this century was Kuhn, Loeb and Company in New York which was headed byJacob Schiff. The Schiff family lived in the same house in Frankfurt as theRothschilds at the time of the founder, Mayer Amschel Rothschild. In 1902, theRothschilds sent their agents, Paul and Felix Warburg, to America to engineerthe creation of the Federal Reserve. Their brother, Max Warburg, stayed behindto run the family banking business which had been started in Venice under theirprevious name, the Abraham del Banco family. When they arrived in the States,Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb, of Kuhn, Loeb and Company, and Felix marriedFrieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob Schiff. Another wonderful example of arrangedmarriages to suit the demands of the bloodlines and the Agenda. Both brothersbecame partners in Kuhn, Loeb and Company and Paul was put on an annual salaryof some half a million dollars in the opening years of this century. That’s thesort of money we are talking about when we discuss the financial power of thisgroup. Imagine what it must be today.The Brotherhood network ensured that the ‘Democrat’ and Rosicrucian, WoodrowWilson, won the presidency in 1909 and his minder was a leading Brotherhoodmember called ‘Colonel’ Mandel House. Wilson described him as “my secondpersonality”, “my alter ego” , and said: “his thoughts and mine are one”. Neverhas a President said a truer word. As is now well documented by researchers, theElite bankers from the Rockefeller-Morgan-Rothschild-Harriman cartels metsecretly at Jekyl Island in Georgia to discuss tactics and the nature of thebill they wished to be passed to establish the bank they so badly desired. JekylIsland, it appears, was owned by the Payseurs and every member of the group wasa Payseur trustee. Their political spokesman was Senator Nelson Aldrich, thegrandfather of Nelson Rockefeller, the four times governor of New York andvice-president of the United States after Gerald Ford replaced Richard Nixon inthe wake of Watergate in 1974. Aldrich’s daughter, Abby, was married to John D.Rockefeller Jr. When the Federal Reserve Bill was going before Congress thebankers who had written the bill vehemently opposed it in public. The bankerswere very unpopular by this time and they wanted to give the impression that thebill was bad for them, so increasing the public support for it to be passed.This sort of manipulation goes on all the time and no matter what anyone issaying about an event in public, we need to keep asking the question “Whobenefits from this happening?” and “Who benefits from me believing what I ambeing told?”They pushed the bill through just before Christmas 1913 when many Congressmenwere already at home with their families for the holiday. Now they could controlAmerican interest rates and make a fortune lending the government money thatdoesn’t exist and charging interest on it. To complete the cycle, however, theyneeded to ensure an endless supply of funds for the government and so theyintroduced a Federal Income Tax Bill, also in 1913. To do this they needed anamendment, the 16th, to the American Constitution, and that required the consentof at least 36 states. Only two states agreed, but Philander Knox, the Secretaryof State, simply announced that the required majority had been achieved and thebill was introduced. To this day the enforced payment of federal income tax isillegal and yet the Brotherhood’s Internal Revenue Service goes on doing that inthe United States every day. Some may say that calling it a terrorist operationis too extreme, but to terrorise someone you don’t have to use a gun or a bomb.You can do it by threatening to destroy their livelihood and evict them fromtheir home to pay you tax that is illegal. Incidentally, note the year of thesetwo events, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Income Tax – 1913. Numbers andyears matter to these people because of the Sun and astrological cycles and soit would all have been timed to happen in 1913. Look at the obsession theBrotherhood groups throughout history have had with the number 13. When theRockefellers set up their Council of State Governments to control the Americanstate legislatures, they based the organisation in a building numbered 1313. Forthe same reason, a great deal happened in 1933 because 33 is a major esotericnumber which represents a vibrational frequency.The Internal Revenue Service which collects taxation in America is also aprivate company, though the public believe it is part of their government. In1863 the Bureau of Internal Revenue was formed to collect taxation, but in 1933,that year again, came the start of another coup on the American people. Threemembers of the Prescott Bush circle, Helen and Clifton Barton and HectorEcheverria, formed the Internal Revenue Tax and Audit Service, registered inDelaware, America’s flag of convenience state, where few questions are asked.Prescott Bush was the father of George Bush. In 1936, this organisation changedits name to the Internal Revenue Service and ran as a private company. In 1953,the original Bureau of Internal Revenue was disbanded, leaving the privateInternal Revenue Service to collect all the taxes, illegal taxes most of them,too. This is controlled by the same people who own the Federal Reserve and theVirginia Company and it is bleeding America dry. The Internal Revenue Servicewas, appropriately, created by American Nazis who were funding Adolf Hitlerunder the coordination of Prescott Bush, George’s father.The black magicians of the Babylonian Brotherhood have weaved their web ofdeceit from the ancient world to the present day, but because they wear smartsuits in public and save their long robes and Satanic masks for their privaterituals, most people find it almost impossible to comprehend the truth of whatis going on before their eyes."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_028.html#filepos769342] Hirsch M.

I will, however, sketchthe fundamentals of what happened to bridge the gap to the new and stunninginformation I wish to pass on.The exploitation of the incredible continent of Africa is a classic story whichserves as an example of what has happened elsewhere. This horrific operation bythe Rothschilds, Oppenhiemers, Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Milner, Jan Smuts andcountless others, was organised through an Elite secret society called the RoundTable, formed in the latter years of the 19th century. It was headed by CecilRhodes who said he wanted to create a world government centred on Britain.Rhodes headed the South Africa Company and established companies like De BeersConsolidated Mines and Consolidated Gold Fields. Rhodes was also Prime Ministerof the Cape Colony and he is said by writer John Coleman (who claims to be aformer British Intelligence operative), to have been a member of an organisationcalled the Committee of 300, also known as The Olympians. These, he claims, arethe three hundred people who, in each generation, run the world under thesupervision of even smaller groups above them in the highest levels of thepyramid. I will use the abbreviation (Comm 300) to depict others I name who arelisted by Coleman.1 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos865923] Some people, Ishould point out, doubt Coleman’s British Intelligence connections. A contactwho has worked at a high level in the financial world, particularly inSwitzerland, told me that he believes these 300 families are the most reptilianon the planet and that is how they qualify for their appointment to thisnetwork. Rhodes began his career in manipulation while a student at OxfordUniversity, that training ground for Brotherhood personnel. His mentor was JohnRuskin, the fine arts professor who is still a legend at Oxford. Ruskin said hebelieved in centralised power and the state owning the means of production anddistribution. His ideas would form the official philosophy of the British LabourParty until more recently and they were also included in the writings of KarlMarx and Friedrich Engels and became the foundations of Marxist communism whichwas soon to grip the nations of Eastern Europe. Ruskin is widely believed byresearchers to have been connected with the Bavarian Illuminati and it was hisinspiration which led to the formation of the Fabian Society, yet anotherBrotherhood operation which to this day manipulates the British Labour Party andoperates further afield. Ruskin was a student of Plato’s works, as were mostBrotherhood clones like Rhodes, Engels, Weishaupt, the Rothschilds and theRothschild associate, Moses Mendelssohn, one of the principle manipulatorsbehind the French Revolution. Rhodes was so in awe of Ruskin that he copied hisinaugural speech in long hand and kept it with him for the rest of his life.Ruskin had a tremendous impact on many undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridgewho would later play their part in the manipulation of the 20th century,including the Rothschild-controlled banker, Alfred Milner.While Rhodes was the frontman for the Round Table, the real control was with theRothschilds and the other bloodline families like the Astors and the Cecils(Ramses-Piso-Bush). The Astor family were big financial backers of Brotherhoodorganisations like the Royal Institute of International Affairs and WaldorfAstor was one of its leaders. The Astors were the centre of the group known asthe Cliveden Set named after their Cliveden Estate, not far from Windsor Castle.The name Astor comes from the ancient goddess, Ashtoreth. One of the Cecils wasLord Salisbury (Comm 300) (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the British Prime Minister andForeign Secretary when the Round Table was engineering the Boer War in SouthAfrica in which tens of thousands of men, women, and children were killed. Manyof them died in the concentration camps of the Freemason, Lord Kitchener (Comm300). Lord Salisbury was a close friend of Winston Churchill, another bloodlinefrontman who would be used to great effect in the Second World War. Thismanipulation and genocide by Rhodes and the Round Table secured control of themineral rights in southern Africa which still continues today through theOppenheimer family. The Union of South Africa itself was created by the RoundTable after a campaign headed by the banker and Rothschild manipulator, AlfredMilner (Comm 300), who became the new leader of the secret society after Rhodesdied in 1902. In his will, Rhodes bequeathed funds to support the Round Table,although the Rothschilds were the main funders. The will left a considerableamount of money to fund a scheme known as Rhodes Scholarships. These finance afew highly selected overseas students (selected by the Brotherhood) to attendOxford University to be indoctrinated into the ‘world government’ Agenda. Theratio of these students who return to their own countries and enter positions ofovert or covert power is remarkable and the selection process is overwhelminglygoverned by genetic history. For example, the most famous Rhodes Scholar in theworld today is Bill Clinton (Ramses-Piso-Bush), President of the United States,and his main advisor at both of his elections was George Stephanopoulos, aRhodes Scholar. The leaders of the future are not decided at each election, theyare reared and mind manipulated to hold those positions from a very young age,sometimes birth, as we shall see a little later. Another man who claimed to havebeen selected for a Rhodes Scholarship was Fred Franz, the former president ofthe Watchtower Society (Jehovah’s Witnesses), who says he turned down theinvitation to Oxford and instead served the Brotherhood by replacing the leaderof the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Freemason Charles Taze Russell, who was rituallykilled on Halloween 1916.2 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866114] Themagazine of the Jehovah’s Witnessess, The Watchtower, is a mass of esotericsymbolism and subliminal images. George Estabrooks, who taught the use ofhypnotism and mind control to British Intelligence, was also a Rhodes Scholar.3[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866448]By 1915 other branches of the Round Table were set up in South Africa, Canada,the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India. In the United States, theRound Table and the wider network was represented by the bloodlines andfinanciers who had arrived from Europe like the Rockefellers, J. P. Morgan andEdward Harriman, although as we have seen even they were wealthy ‘gofers’answerable to higher powers. They used Rothschild and Payseur funding to buildvast empires which controlled banking, business, oil, steel, etc, and ran theUnited States economy in the way the Oppenhiemers do in South Africa. All thesebranches, however, are subordinate to the central operational control centre inEurope, especially London. These same families in America, the so-called‘Eastern Establishment’, are the force behind one of American’s most sinisterand Satanic secret societies, the Skull and Bones Society, based in a windowlessmausoleum at Yale University in Connecticut known appropriately as the ‘Tomb’.Here highly selected students meet twice a week during term time. Thisinterlocks with the Templars, the Freemasons and the Round Table network. Theskull and bones symbol relates to the skull ceremonies of the Knights Templarand many other Brotherhood groups which inspired this Satanic, blood drinking,secret society. Other Brotherhood universities in the United States, likeHarvard, have similar secret societies, but the Skull and Bones appears to bethe most influential. A network of the same kind operates in Britain at Oxford,Cambridge, Edinburgh and other Universities. The Skull and Bones Society isbelieved to have been introduced to the United States more than 150 years ago asChapter 322 of a German Secret Society and was also known at one time as theBrotherhood of Death. What is known for sure is the Skull and Bones Society wasformed in 1832-33 by a group which included Daniel Coit Gilman, the manresponsible for setting up the American tax exempt foundations like theRockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. OtherSkull and Bones founders were General William Huntington Russell and AlphonsoTaft, of a famous American family. Taft was Secretary of War in the Grantadministration and his son, William Howard Taft, was the only man to be bothPresident and Chief Justice of the United States. Like the Russells(Ramses-Piso-Bush), the Tafts (Ramses-Piso-Bush) are an ancient bloodline familyrelated to Skull and Bones member, George Bush. The Skull and Bones is deeplyracist and was founded on the money made from the illegal drug operations of theRussells. This Society is incorporated into the Russell Trust and its initiationceremonies take place on an island in the St Lawrence River owned by the RussellTrust Association. Most of the land on which Yale University is built is alsoowned by the same association.The Russell family made their fortune from running opium from Turkey to Chinaduring the British opium wars against the Chinese, when the BlackNobility-Brotherhood in London was invading China by flooding that society withaddictive drugs. The Russells later fused their operation with other bloodlinefamilies like Coolidge and Delano (Comm 300 family designate), both of whichproduced Presidents of the United States, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin DelanoRoosevelt (Ramses-Piso-Bush). The Russells used to fly the skull and bones flagon their ships carrying the drugs and the Skull and Bones Society continues thisdrug running tradition through people like George Bush, one of the major drugbarons in North America. The Russell Illuminati bloodline was also behind thecreation of the Watchtower Society (Jehovah's Witnesses) and the Mormons, andcontrols the Illuminati private ‘security’ company, Wackenhut. The Skull andBones Society is dominated by about 20–30 families overwhelmingly from theEastern Seaboard. Most claim ancestry with the British aristocracy (true) orhave a genetic line going back to the English ‘Puritan’ families who arrived inAmerican around 1630–1660 under the policy of emigration inspired by Sir FrancisBacon and his circle. These families have either secured financial powerthemselves or married into wealth via the sons of moguls like the Rockefellersand Harrimans. The key criteria for membership of the Skull and Bones is yourgenetic history. Are you reptilian enough? Major players in the manipulation ofthe 20th century have been initiated into the Skull and Bones Society whilststudents at Yale. Among them Averell Harriman, son of Edward, and one of theBrotherhood’s most active manipulators before his death at 91 in 1986. GeorgeBush’s father, Prescott Bush, was also a Skull and Bones member and it was hewho ransacked the grave of the Apache Chief, Geronimo, and took his skull backto the Yale headquarters for their skull ceremonies. (See …And The Truth ShallSet You Free.) Prescott Bush made his fortune through the Harriman(Payseur/Rothschild) empire and would later help to fund Adolf Hitler.So by the early years of the 20th century the situation was this: The BabylonianBrotherhood operational network headquartered in London had introduced anotherElite grouping called the Round Table with branches all over the world. Thisoperation and its interlocking secret societies, banks, businesses, newspapers,and political placemen, controlled the United States, Canada, South Africa andother African countries, Australia, New Zealand, India, many parts of the FarEast, including Hong Kong, and vast swathes of the rest of the world under thetitle of the ‘British Empire’. Fundamentally involved in this network was theBritish royal family headed after Queen Victoria by her Freemason son, EdwardVII, and when he died in 1910 came George V (all Ramses-Piso-Bush). Edward, inleague with his Black Nobility friends in the City of London, greatly increasedthe personal fortune of the royal family. They were soon to change their namefrom the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor to obscure their Germanorigins during the horrors of the First World War. With these global networksnow in place, the scene was set for the grotesque manipulation of the 20thCentury. I will briefly describe the background to some of the main events inthis chapter, but for greater detail and sources see …And The Truth Shall SetYou Free.The First World WarThe Brotherhood wanted a global war as a massive problem-reaction-solution todestroy the global status quo so allowing them to rebuild the post war world intheir image. It worked brilliantly. After the First World War, power was in farfewer hands than it was before. The British and American governments in theimmediate post war period were controlled by the Round Table leadership. InBritain these were people like Alfred Milner (Comm 300) and Lord Balfour (Comm300) and in America, Colonel House (Comm 300), the dictator of policy toPresident Woodrow Wilson. In Germany the official head of the country was KaiserWilhelm II (Ramses-Piso-Bush), a relative of the British/German royal familysoon to be known as the Windsors. Wilhelm’s ‘minder’ was the leading GermanFreemason, Otto von Bismark, the architect of the German Empire, and otherFreemasons and bloodline families. Kaiser Wilhelm’s Chancellor wasBethmann-Hollweg, a member of the Bethmann banking family in Frankfurt and acousin of the Rothschilds. Wilhelm’s personal banker was Max Warburg, thebrother of Paul and Felix, who had helped to manipulate the US Federal Reserveinto being. Meantime, the Rothschilds had bought the German news agency, Wolff,to control the flow of information to the German people and what the rest of theworld would hear from inside Germany. One of the leading executives of Wolffwas… Max Warburg. The Rothschilds would later buy an interest in the Havas newsagency in France and Reuters in London. (News agencies supply ‘news’ to allmedia organisations.) All that was needed to spark the war was an incident whichcould be used to justify hostilities and that was provided when an agent of aSerbian secret society called the Order of the Black Hand assassinated ArchdukeFerdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne on June 28th 1914. At exactlythe same time in Russia, an attempt was being made on the life of the Tsar’smost trusted advisor, Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin, who was arguing against awar. The Black Hand was formed in 1911 as the Order of Death and its seal was aclenched fist holding a skull and bones and alongside that was a knife, a bomband a poison bottle.4 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866531] Lovely.Leading members of the Black Hand apparently met with French and Grand OrientFreemasons at the Hotel St Jerome in Toulouse in January 1914 to arrange theassassination in Sarajevo.5 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866644] Theactual assassins, led by Gavrilo Princip, were all suffering from tuberculosisand did not have long to live. They were suckers manipulated to carry out an actthinking it would serve Serbian nationalism when it was really the sparkrequired to advance an Agenda they probably did not know existed. So it is withassassins and terrorists galore over thousands of years. How do such people stopthemselves being used in this way? Very simple. Don’t kill anyone, harm anyone,or plant bombs under any circumstances whatsoever. There, all sorted.The German branches of the Brotherhood network started hostilities and thebranches in the rest of Europe followed. The people who actually fought this warwere the innocent pawns in a game they did not understand. Half a million mendied in one battle in the trenches of northern France, a gigantic orgy of bloodletting in an area which is sacred land to the Satanists and blood drinkers whorun this world. These are mass ritual sacrifices to the reptilians. The war wascreated by problem-reaction-solution and the same technique was used to bringthe United States into the conflict as planned. In his election campaign for thepresidency, Woodrow Wilson had told the American people that he would not allowAmerica to become involved in a European war. He had to say that or he would nothave been elected. But he knew that was part of the Brotherhood Agenda and so in1916 the American passenger ship, the Lusitania, was sunk and this was used asan excuse to enter the war. In the same way, the assassination of Ferdinand wasGermany’s excuse and in 1941 the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbour wasused by the American reptile-Aryan President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, toenter the Second World War. A member of one of the bloodline families, AlfredGwynne Vanderbilt, was on the Lusitania when it sank. An urgent telegram tellinghim not to sail on that voyage failed to reach him. The head of the US WarIndustries Board was another vital cog in the Brotherhood network in thiscentury. He was Bernard Baruch (Comm 300), who said that he had…”probably morepower than perhaps any other man did in the war…”6[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866734] Baruch and Mandel House were theday-to-day decision makers in the American branch of the London-based RoundTable.In the 1950s, yet more confirmation of how the First World War was manipulatedwas revealed by a US Congressional investigation into the ‘tax-exempt’foundations in the United States, like the Rockefeller Foundation, the FordFoundation, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which theinvestigation found was manipulating war! Another thing to watch. TheBrotherhood name organisations in a way that leads people to believe their aimis the opposite of what they are really there to do. For instance, if you wantto run drugs without being suspected, do it through an anti-drug agency. If youwant to destroy land and kill wildlife, do it through a wildlife protectionagency. If you want to run a Satanic ring, do it through the Christian Church.The Congressional investigation by the Reece Committee found that thesefoundations had an interlocking leadership and that they were funding‘education’ and ‘science’ to advance their Agenda for the centralisation ofglobal power. The outcome of scientific ‘research’ was being agreed before thefunding was handed over. No agreement on the outcome, no cash. This is one majorway that scientific knowledge is suppressed. Knowledge which could set the worldfree from hunger and the need for the expensive, polluting ‘energy’ technologywe have today. The relevant findings of the Reece Committee in relation to theFirst World War came with their investigation into the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace. Norman Dodd, the committee’s Director of Research, reportedthat at one meeting of the Carnegie trustees, the question was asked:“‘Is there any means known to man more effective than war if you want to alterthe lives of an entire people?’ It was decided that there was not and so thenext question they asked was: ‘How do we involve the United States in a war?’.”Dodd went on:“And then they raised the question: ‘How do we control the diplomatic machineryof the United States?’ And the answer came out: ‘We must control the StateDepartment’. At this point we catch up with what we already found out… thatthrough an agency set up by the Carnegie Endowment, every high appointment inthe State Department was cleared. Finally, we were in a war. These trustees in ameeting about 1917 had the brashness to congratulate themselves on the wisdom oftheir original decision because already the impact of the war had indicated itwould alter life and can alter life in this country. This was the date of ourentry in the war; we were involved. They even had the brashness to word and todispatch a telegram to Mr Wilson cautioning him to see that the war did not endtoo quickly.”7 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos866889]Dodd said that his investigator, Kathryn Casey, found other minutes dealing withthe work of the Carnegie Endowment to prevent American life returning to apre-war state. Changing the way people lived and thought was, after all, themain point of the war. Dodd said:“They came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, they must controleducation. And then they approached the Rockefeller Foundation and they said:“Will you take on the acquisition of control of education as it involvessubjects that are domestic in their significance?” And it was agreed. Thentogether they decided that the key to it was the teaching of American historyand they must change that. So, they then approached the most prominent of whatyou might call American historians at that time with the idea of getting them toalter the manner in which they presented the subject.”8[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867317]This is why you don’t read what really happened in the official history books.You read what the Brotherhood wants you to read. This is the crap that is taughtto our children in schools and universities under the heading of ‘education’.The same with all the other subjects. This is the ‘education’ that Americanfamilies spend their lives scrimping and saving for. They are scrimping andsaving to pay for their children to be indoctrinated, that’s the reality. Thepoint of the First World War was to reshape the post-war world in the image thereptilians desired. So the very people who engineered the war on all ‘sides’were appointed to the Versailles Peace Conference, near Paris (again!) in 1919to decide what would happen as a result of the war they had manufactured. ThePalace of Versailles is also known as the Palace of the Sun King. The‘victorious’ stooges, sorry leaders, at Versailles were Woodrow Wilson of theUnited States, Lloyd George (Comm 300) of Great Britain, and Georges Clemenceauof France. But behind the movie screen what was really happening? Wilson was‘advised’ by Colonel Mandel House (Comm 300) and Bernard Baruch (Comm 300), bothRothschild-Round Table representatives; Lloyd George was advised by AlfredMilner (Comm 300), official leader of the Round Table and Sir Phillip Sassoon, adirect descendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild; Clemenceau had Georges Mandel,his Minister of the Interior, whose real name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Also onthe American Commission to Negotiate Peace were the infamous Dulles brothers;Paul Warburg; Thomas Lamont from J. P. Morgan (Payseur); Robert Lansing, theSecretary of State, an uncle of the infamous Dulles brothers; and Walter Lippman(Comm 300), the founder of the American branch of the Fabian Society. Allbloodline reptilian families. The German delegation included Max Warburg,brother of Paul Warburg on the American side! The host of the conference wasBaron Edmund de Rothschild, a leading campaigner for a Jewish State inPalestine, for which the Versailles Peace Conference confirmed its support. Andnone of the history books will tell you any of this. Out of the conference camethe World Court in The Hague, Netherlands, and the League of Nations, theBrotherhood’s first attempt to create a global organisation which could beevolved into a world government. The first draft of what became the covenant ofthe League of Nations was written by Colonel House, as were Woodrow Wilson’sfamous ‘fourteen points’ at Versailles. Years earlier, House had written a novelcalled Philip Dru: Administrator, which he later admitted was fact presented asfiction. In the book, published anonymously two years before the First WorldWar, he had proposed an organisation called… the League of Nations. The war wasall a plot to further the Agenda and it cost the lives of millions. The Leagueof Nations eventually collapsed, but one war later their ambition was achievedwith the creation of the United Nations in 1945.The Russian Revolution/Cold WarThe Russia Revolution in 1917, during the First World War, lead to the formationof the Soviet Union and later to the Cold War. A constant theme of Brotherhoodmanipulation through the centuries is the creation of monsters for people tofear, something they proceeded to do with Communism in the Soviet Union andChina. The hierarchy of these two regions interlock with the Brotherhood networkand bloodlines, but of course the people don’t know that. The public believedthat the United States leadership was opposed to the Soviet Union because onewas capitalist and one was communist. Not true. They are different kinds ofcartels, that’s all, and controlled, ultimately, by the same people. Communismwas created by Wall Street and the City of London to generate enormous fear andconflict which was used to great effect to advance the Agenda. As always, it wasplanned long before it became public. The Communist Manifesto was written by (orfor) Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels. Marx was a student of the German occultist,Bruno Bauer (Rothschild) and married into the reptilian bloodlines of theScottish aristocracy. Some of his writings were vehemently anti-Jewish whichappears contradictory because he was supposed to be Jewish. But he wasn’t. Hewas another ‘Aryan’ bloodline doing his job for the cause – the reptile cause.All these years the far left in politics have revered Marx as a ‘man of thepeople’ when all along he was a man to imprison the people. The action began inRussia when the Rothschilds manipulated the Tsar into a war with Japan in 1905.The European Rothschilds lent money to the Russians for that conflict whiletheir American branch, Kuhn, Loeb and Company, funded the Japanese. The wardemolished the Russian economy, not least to pay back the Rothschilds, plusinterest, and this helped to fuel the simmering rebellion. When the First WorldWar began and Russia came in against Germany, weapons supplies to the Russianarmy were systematically delayed by Rothschild companies like Vickers Maxim, andeventually the soldiers mutinied. Vickers Maxim was controlled by Ernest Cassel,a business associate of Kuhn, Loeb amd Company and the biggest shareholders werethe Rothschilds. The daughter of Ernest Cassal would marry Lord Mountbatten(Ramses-Piso-Bush), a Rothschild,9 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867400]and the man who arranged the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II to his nephew,Prince Philip. The interconnecting reptilian bloodlines are simply fantastic.The Russian Revolution ended 300 years of rule by the Romanov family which hadbegun in the 17th century with Mikhail Romanov, who is believed to have beensupported by the occultist and Rosicrucian, Dr Arthur Dee, and the BritishSecret Service. Arthur Dee was the son of Dr John Dee, the infamous astrologerto Queen Elizabeth I. But these families are all subordinate to the Agenda andnow it was time for the Romanovs to go. The same applied to the Habsburg andHohenstaufen dynasties in the same period. The infrastructure was long in placeto unseat the Romanovs, with Freemasonry, the Rosicrucians, and other secretgroupings flourishing in Russia from the second half of the 18th century. Thefirst charge to remove the Romanovs was led by Alexander Kerensky, a Freemason,funded from Wall Street and London. A second and more brutal wave was led byLeon Trotsky and Lenin. Trotsky left Germany to live in New York and it was fromthere that he set off on his journey to Russia and the Bolshevik Revolution. Heentered Russia on a United States passport provided for him by the President,Woodrow Wilson, and on his person was $10,000 provided by the Rockefellers. Hewas joined in Russia by Lenin who was given safe passage in a sealed trainacross Germany from Switzerland via Sweden. Massive amounts of Bolshevikpropaganda was financed by the Germans. While Lenin, Trotsky, and the rest werepublicly condemning ‘capitalism’, they were being financed by the Brotherhoodbankers of Wall Street and London, the same people who would later supportHitler. In his autobiography Trotsky would refer to some of these loans, many ofwhich were arranged by the Round Table’s Alfred Milner and ‘Alexander’Gruzenberg (real name Michael), the chief Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia. He wasa confidential advisor to the J. P. Morgan (Payseur)-owned Chase National Bankin New York. One of the most active middle men between the Bolsheviks, London,and Wall Street, was Olof Aschberg who became known as the Bolshevik’s banker.He owned Nya Banken, founded in Stockholm in 1912. Aschberg’s London agent wasthe North Commerce Bank, chaired by Earl Grey, a member of the Round Table andfriend of Cecil Rhodes. Another close associate of Aschberg was Max May, thevice-president of the J. P. Morgan (Payseur) Guaranty Trust and head of itsoverseas operations.In 1915, the American International Corporation had been formed to fund theRussian Revolution. It’s directors represented the interests of theRockefellers, Kuhn, Loeb and Company (Rothschilds), DuPont, Harriman, and theFederal Reserve. They also included George Herbert Walker Bush, the grandfatherof George Bush. The Rothschilds were directly financing the Revolution via JacobSchiff at Kuhn, Loeb and Company. International Brotherhood bankers fromBritain, the United States, Russia, Germany, and France met in Sweden in theSummer of 1917. They agreed that Kuhn, Loeb and Company would deposit $50million in a Swedish bank account for Lenin and Trosky’s use. In an article inThe New York American Journal on February 3rd 1949, Jacob Schiff’s grandson saidthat his grandfather had paid the two ‘revolutionaries’ an additional $20million. The payment of $20 million to the Bolsheviks by Elishu Root (the Kuhn,Loeb and Company’s lawyer and former Secretary of State) via the Special WarFund, is recorded in the Congressional Record of September 2nd 1919. Thisinvestment not only furthered the Brotherhood Agenda, it realised anunbelievable profit. Some researchers suggest that Lenin repaid Kuhn, Loeb, therouble equivalent of $450 million between 1918 and 1922. This was nothingcompared with the profits accrued from the exploitation of Russian land, itseconomy and people, including the theft of the Tsar’s gold and his vastfinancial holdings which were held, and stolen, by the very banks who had fundedthe revolution. Russia, like the rest of the world, has been raped by thereptilians. There is so much more to tell about this story and I do so in …AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free, but I wanted to give you enough to see that theRussian Revolution, and all that came out of it, was another operation by theBrotherhood.Communism would also be played against Fascism (the same thing in truth) in theSecond World War, and when that was over, fear of the Soviet ‘monster’ was usedto further manipulate global events and justify enormous arms spending with thevery armament and aircraft companies owned by the reptilians. Therefore theyensured there was either parity or the Soviet Union were slightly ahead, and inthis way they created fear on both sides and a reason to keep buying ever moreexpensive weapons from their companies – ‘keep up with the Russians’. The ColdWar was classic manipulation. The people of the West were terrified of theSoviet Union and the people of the Soviet Union were terrified of the West whileboth sides were secretly controlled by the same people. At the heart of this wasthe emergence of nuclear weapons during the Second World War thanks to theManhattan Project in America led by Robert Oppenhiemer. The Manhattan Projectwas supported by the Brotherhood-controlled Institute for Advanced Study atPrinceton University where Albert Einstein was a regular visitor. Einstein, whoworked on the development of the atomic bomb, was a close associate of BernardBaruch and Lord Victor Rothschild (Comm 300), the man who controlled BritishIntelligence for decades. Rothschild used these very contacts to supply theState of Israel with the know-how to build nuclear weapons. But, of course, ifthe United States had these devastating weapons and the Russians did not, therewould be no Cold War, so the technological knowledge was passed on to them.Pavel A. Sudoplatov, the head of the Soviet Intelligence Bureau on the atomicproblem during World War Two, has now confirmed that Oppenhiemer was supplyingdata about the bomb to the Soviet Union during the war.10[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867525] Klaus Fuchs, the German physicist,worked on the Manhattan Project after fleeing from Germany to Britain in 1933.Fuchs, an associate of Lord Victor Rothschild, was later jailed for fourteenyears for supplying British and American atomic secrets to the Russians. I knowfrom people I have met in the intelligence community in the United States, andfrom the research of other writers, that nuclear weapons know-how was beingpassed from the United States to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, notleast through the Pugwash Conferences inspired by Einstein and Bertrand Russell(Comm 300) of the bloodline Russell family. Pugwash comes from the name of theCanadian estate of the industrialist Cyrus Eaton, where the conferences wereheld. Eaton began his career as secretary to J. D. Rockefeller and became abusiness partner of the Rockefeller dynasty. In 1946, Bertrand Russell, a friendof Einstein, said it was necessary to use the fear of nuclear weapons to forceall nations to give up their sovereignty and submit to the dictatorship of theUnited Nations.11 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867669]Eventually the Agenda’s time-scale reached the point where the countries of theSoviet Union had to be encompassed into the European Union and NATO in line withthe plan for a world government and world army. That could not be done while theSoviet Union was still there and seen as the ‘evil empire’. Onto the stagesuddenly came Michail Gorbachev, an associate and subordinate of those twoBrotherhood manipulators, Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller, and it was hisjob to play the good guy and break up the Soviet Union. The Berlin Wall camedown and people thought it was a blow for freedom, but it was just another stepon the road to total global domination. Gorbachev left office and now runs theBrotherhood-funded Gorbachev Foundation which puts on prestigious conferencescalling for a world government. He is another shape-shifting reptilian as seenby contacts of mine.The creation of IsraelZionism is often said to be the heart of the conspiracy, but I don’t agree. Itis part of it yes, but the Brotherhood network is far bigger than that. Zionismis not the Jewish people, it is a political movement. Many Jews do not supportit, many non-Jews do. To say that Zionism is the Jewish people is like sayingthe Democratic Party is the American people. Yet to challenge the extremes ofZionism is to be called anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. What utter balls. Just asthe Republic of South Africa is really the Fiefdom of Oppenheimers, so the Stateof Israel is really the State of Rothschild. Zionism was the creation of theRothschilds on behalf of the Brotherhood and in truth it is not Zionist, butSIONism, a branch of the reptile-Aryan Sun cult religion. It has been used toensure the take over of Arab Palestine for two main reasons. This is sacred landfor the reptile-Aryans going back to the Levites and the ancient world. Alsoblatantly stealing an Arab country offered endless opportunities to fosterconflict and division in the Middle East, and this was particularly effective inmanipulating the Arab oil states. The crucial moment in the Rothschild plan for‘Israel’ was the Balfour Declaration when the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur(Lord) Balfour, announced on November 6th 1917 that Britain supported the claimfor a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The Rothschilddominated Versailles PeaceConference confirmed their support for this also. Surprise, surprise. But whatwas this Balfour Declaration? It was not made to members of the WestminsterParliament. It was simply a letter from Lord Balfour (Comm 300), an inner-circlemember of the Round Table secret society, to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild (Comm300), who funded the Round Table! It was a letter between two members of thesame secret society. Rothschild was a representative of the English Federationof Zionists which was set up with Rothschild money. It is widely believed byresearchers that the ‘Balfour’ letter was actually written by Lord Rothschildtogether with Alfred Milner (Comm 300), the Round Table’s leading light who hadbeen made chairman of the mining giant, Rio Tinto Zinc, by the same LordRothschild. Rio Tinto is heavily involved in South Africa and a majorshareholder apparently is the Queen of England. The Arabs of Palestine were usedto fight the Turks in the First World War under the command of the Englishmen,T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) who promised them full sovereignty for theirefforts. All along he knew that the Brotherhood plan was for the ‘Jewish’(Khazar-Aryan) homeland in Palestine. Lawrence, a close friend of WinstonChurchill, later admitted this fact when he said:“I risked the fraud on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheapand easy victory in the East, and that better we win and break our word, thanlose… The Arab inspiration was our main tool for winning the Eastern War. So Iassured them that England kept her word in letter and in spirit. In this comfortthey performed their fine things; but, of course, instead of being proud of whatwe did together, I was continually bitter and ashamed.”12[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867799]Such has been the reptile-Aryan modus operandi for thousands of years. It wasthe Rothschilds who funded the early ‘Jewish’ settlers in Palestine; it was theRothschilds who helped to create and fund Hitler and the Nazis in the SecondWorld War which included the sickening treatment of Jews, gypsies, communists,and others; it was the Rothschilds who used the understandable post-war sympathyfor the ‘Jews’ they had mercilessly exploited to press through their demands fora take-over of Arab Palestine; it was the Rothschilds who funded the ‘Jewish’terrorist groups in Palestine which bombed, murdered, and terrorised Israel intoexistence; and it was the Rothschilds who funded and manipulated theseterrorists into the key positions in Israel, among them the Prime Ministers,Ben-Gurion, Shamir, Begin, and Rabin. These men would spend the rest of theirlives condemning the terrorism of others with an hypocrisy which beggars belief;it was Lord Victor Rothschild, the controller of British Intelligence, whoprovided the know-how for Israel’s nuclear weapons; it was the Rothschilds whoowned and controlled Israel from the start and have continued ever since todictate its policy; it was the Rothschilds and the rest of the Brotherhoodnetwork which has hidden and suppressed the fact, confirmed by Jewishhistorians, that the overwhelming majority of ‘Jewish’ people in Israeloriginate genetically from the Caucasus Mountains, not from the lands they nowoccupy. The Jewish people have been sacrificed on the Rothschild altar of greedand lust for power, but even the Rothschilds take their orders from a higherauthority which, I believe, is probably based in Asia, and the Far East dictatesto the operational headquarters in London. Ultimately, the whole scam isorchestrated from the lower fourth dimension. For the background, detail, andsources, to support the statements I have just made, again you will find them in…And The Truth Shall Set You Free.The Second World WarAt the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919 a number of decisions were made whichculminated in the genocide known as World War Two. Firstly the reparationsimposed on the German people were so fantastic that the Weimar Republic whichfollowed the war had no chance of economic survival. This was precisely asplanned. That economic chaos was a massive problem in need of a solution and thesolution was Adolf Hitler. The second important development, in a secret meetingof the Versailles collaborators at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, was the creationof offshoot organisations connected to the original Round Table. The first camein 1920 with the formation of the Institute of International Affairs, also knownas Chatham House, at 10 St James’s Square in London. The monarch is its officialhead and it was given the title Royal Institute in 1926. It’s American branch,the Council on Foreign Relations, was formed by the American members of theRound Table in 1921 with funds from the Rockefellers and others. These wereadditions to the Brotherhood network designed to control even more completelyBritish and American politics and indeed the much wider world. They are both thesame organisation under different names. The Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs (RIIA) was formed by friends of Cecil Rhodes and all the familiar names,including the Astors. It was funded, as it is today, by a long, long, list ofglobal corporations and media groups owned by the bloodline families. I listthem in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free.The Royal Institute connects into the top levels of politics, banking, business,media, all the usual stuff. For instance, one of its top figures was Major John(Jacob) Astor (Comm 300), a director of the Hambros (Brotherhood) Bank and ownerafter 1922 of the Times newspaper. Other founders included Sir Abe Bailey, theowner of Transvaal Mines in South Africa who worked with Alfred Milner to startthe Boer War; and John W. Wheeler-Bennett, who would be General Eisenhower’s‘political advisor’ in London in the last two crucial years of the Second WorldWar when the design for the post war world was being drawn. The Instituteinterlocks with British universities like Oxford and Cambridge and the LondonSchool of Economics which has produced many of the ‘radicals’ of the political‘left’. Adolf Hitler’s infamous book, Mein Kampf, was ghost-written by MajorGeneral Karl Haushofer, who acknowledged that a major source of the ideas itexpressed was Halford J. MacKinder, a director of the London School ofEconomics. As with the Round Table, Royal Institute branches were established inAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and India, whereit is known as the Council of World Affairs. Its American branch, the Council onForeign Relations (CFR), made its home at Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68thStreet in New York, the former mansion of the Pratt family, friends of theRockefellers. It was organised by Colonel Mandel House, J. P. Morgan (Payseur),the Rockefellers, and their associates. The CFR was soon in control of theUnited States and that remains the case today. Look at its membership and youwill find the top people in all the institutions which control the lives of theAmerican people, including education. These organisations, like the Round Table,are made up of inner and outer circles.The inner circle knows the Agenda andworks full time to achieve it. The next circle knows much of the Agenda andworks to that end in their particular sphere of influence. The next circle ispretty much in the dark about the real Agenda, but is manipulated to make the‘right’ decisions in their area of operation without knowing the true reason forthem. Admiral Chester Ward, a former US Judge Advocate General of the Navy, wasa member of the CFR for sixteen years. He said that the purpose of theorganisation was the “…submergence of US sovereignty and national independenceinto an all-powerful one-world government”. In his book, Kissinger On The Couch,written with Phyllis Schafly, Ward said:“…(the)…lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United Statesis pervasive throughout most of the membership, and particularly in theleadership of several divergent cliques that make up what is actually apolycentric organisation… (the main clique) is composed of theone-world-global-government ideologists – more respectfully referred to as theorganised internationalists. They are the ones who carry on the tradition of thefounders.”Since 1921 virtually every President of the United States has been a member ofthe CFR along with most of the main government posts including most, today all,the American ambassadors around the world. The CFR also includes media owners,key journalists and editors, educationalists, military leaders, on and on itgoes. The membership of the Royal Institute of International Affairs remains asecret, but it also includes people of the same positions and background in theUnited Kingdom and I stress the American CFR is subordinate to, and takes ordersfrom, the Royal Institute in London. These interlock with the Illuminati; the‘knight’ Orders like the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta); the networkcontrolled by the British monarch which I will reveal later; the Freemasons,Rosicrucians, and the Round Table; the American ‘foundation’ network like theRockefeller Foundation and an endless web of interconnecting groups operatingultimately to the same global leadership. This network was spanning the globe bythe 1930s and the Brotherhood was ready for its biggest project yet, the SecondWorld War. It was an effort to achieve further centralisation of power and thecreation of a global body which could be evolved into a world government. Weknow that body today as the United Nations.With the German economy in tatters and inflation running at thousands of percent, the German people looked to Adolf Hitler as their saviour.Problem-reactionsolution. As I document and source in …And The Truth Shall SetYou Free, the Nazis were funded from Wall Street and the City of London. Thiswas done via the German subsidiaries of British and American companies andAmerican loans known as the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan. These loans weresupposed to be helping Germany to pay the reparations, but in fact went straightinto Hitler’s war machine. Standard Oil (the Rockefellers) and I. G. Farben, theGerman chemical cartel which ran the concentration camp at Auchwitz, were, ineffect, the same company. Hitler came to power in 1933 and in that same year, nocoincidence, Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President of the United States.His route to power was the same as Hitler’s. In 1929, the Brotherhood bankerscrashed the Wall Street stock-market and caused the Great Depression. From thisproblem came the solution, the ‘New Deal’ economic package offered by Rooseveltwhich won him the presidential election of 1933. This ‘New Deal’ was a replicaof the economic package offered by Hitler to the German people to solve theirmanufactured economic problems. When he came to power, Roosevelt pulled off oneof the biggest thefts in human history when he passed laws forcing the Americanpeople to hand over all their gold to the government in return for worthlesspieces of paper known as Federal Reserve banknotes. This was necessary, he said,to solve the dire economic problems. Soon afterwards, with the American economynow completely under Brotherhood control, Roosevelt put their symbol, thepyramid and all seeing eye, on the dollar bill. He was saying to the Americanpeople: “Gotch-yer”.Franklin Roosevelt (Ramses-Piso-Bush), a 33rd degree Freemason, held the title,Knight of Pythias, in a secret society called the Ancient Arabic Order of Noblesand Mystics. Among its previous members were Francis Bacon and the Frenchrevolutionary, Mirabeau. Membership is only open to Freemasons who have reachedat least the 32nd degree or are members of the Templar lodges of Freemasonry.13[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos867961] The Order was allegedly founded bya descendant of Mohammed who based it on a secret society in medieval Europewhich included Jews, Arabs, and Christians.14[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868075] Its symbol is a crescent moonrepresented by the claws of a Bengal Tiger, engraved with a pyramid, an urn, andthe pentagram, a combination representing the Universal Mother:Isis-Semiramis-Ninkharsag.15 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868159]Roosevelt’s Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, was also an occultist whowas involved in the decision to put the all-seeing eye symbol on the dollarbill.16 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868243] Wallace had a guru, theRussian mystic and artist, Nicholas Roerich, who spent many years travellingthrough Nepal and Tibet studying with the lamas and searching for the lost cityof Shamballa, the legendary home of the secret occult adepts or ‘masters’ whoare said to have secretly ‘influenced’ world affairs throughout history. Theyare variously known as the Secret Chiefs, the Hidden Masters, or the Great WhiteBrotherhood and some researchers believe they are the force behind the creationof the Freemasons, Sufis, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Theosophical Society,and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.17[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868327] I think these people arereptilians, some of them anyway. Roerich was involved in the formation of theLeague of Nations, the first attempt at world government, and supported the workof Dr Andrija Puharich, a scientist who helped to develop the psychic powers ofa young Israeli called Uri Geller.18[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868417]In Britain, the Round Table-Royal Institute of International Affairs members inthe Houses of Parliament at first called for appeasement with Germany untilHitler’s military build up had reached the point where he could fight a longwar. Then suddenly, as I show clearly in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, theyswitched and called for all-out war against Hitler. Among the most grotesqueexamples of this were Lady Astor, Leopold Amery, Lionel Curtis, and LordLothian, all members of the Round Table and/or the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary and a Round Tablemember almost from its foundation, was another who supported the appeasement ofHitler. He met Hitler on November 19th 1937 and Hitler’s representative, AlfredRosenberg, had come to Britain in May 1933, to meet with Sir Henry Deterding(Comm 300), head of Royal Dutch Shell, Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of the Timesnewspaper owned by the Astors (Round Table, Royal Institute, Comm 300), the 1stViscount Hailsham, the Secretary for War, Walter Eliot MP, and the Duke of Kent,brother of King Edward VIII and King George VI. We will see the British Royalfamily’s Nazi connections later. The sudden change from appeasement with Hitlerto war with him was mirrored in Downing Street as the appeaser prime minister,Neville Chamberlain, was replaced by the Brotherhood’s man of war, WinstonChurchill, on May 11th 1940. Soon after his appointment, the mass bombing ofcivilian targets in Germany began. The reptile-Aryan black magicians hadthemselves another global blood ritual.Churchill’s membership of the Freemasons has often been played down as it haswith Prince Philip. But Churchill was in fact, behind the scenes, a very activeMason after his initiation into the Studholme Lodge (No 1591) at the Cafe Royalin May 1901.19 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868507] Local historians inBradford, England, uncovered evidence that some of Churchill’s wartime policieswere influenced by the fact that he and King George II of Greece were Masons.One example of this was in 1943 when Churchill sent 5,000 troops to Athens torestore George to the throne even though the beleaguered monarch was detested byall sides and the troops were needed elsewhere.20[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868634] The Churchill family has closelinks with the Rothschilds and the esoteric underground. Winston Churchilljoined the Albion Lodge of the Ancient Order of Druids at Blenheim Palace onAugust 15th 1908.21 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868718] His father,Lord Randolph Churchill, was funded by the House of Rothschild while he wasChancellor of the Exchequer in the mid 1800s and his closest friend wasNathaniel Rothschild. When Randolph died, he was in debt to the Rothschilds tothe tune of £65,000, a fantastic amount in those days.22[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos868879] Winston, too, was in debt to themand he was a good friend of Lord Victor Rothschild, the orchestrator of BritishIntelligence, and the Rothschilds’ arch manipulator in the United States,Bernard Baruch. Churchill had close links with the Cecil family who, in effect,controlled him, and the Cecils have long time connections with the networkscreated by that Brotherhood front, the Jesuits, and to the Habsburgs, theBritish monarchs, and the families of the Black Nobility in Italy. TheChurchills are related to the Duke of Marlborough family who played an importantrole in putting William of Orange on the British throne and in fact WinstonChurchill was born at their ancestral home, Blenheim Palace, near Oxford.Churchill knew exactly what he was doing and the image of him left us byofficial history is a farce. He did not save the British Isles from tyranny, hewas part of the tyranny.An American decoding officer at the United States Embassy in London called TylerKent was jailed throughout the war for passing evidence to the Conservative MP,Colonel Ramsey, that Churchill and Roosevelt had been communicating in codedmessages before Churchill was Prime Minister making arrangements to ensure thatwar would break out. Ramsey was also jailed under a law called Regulation 18bwhich was introduced just before the war, the Government said, to deal withterrorism by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Another problem-reaction-solution.This was merely the excuse they used to have a law in place that would allowthem to jail people without trial during the war and so keep the lid on theirgame. One woman, an admiral’s wife, was jailed under regulation 18b as she lefta courtroom which had cleared her of all charges! The man behind this law wasLord Victor Rothschild, one of the most important manipulators of the secondhalf of the 20th century and a friend of Winston Churchill. It was Churchill whobegan to use Regulation 18b as soon as he took office in order to jail peoplewho knew what was going on and were prepared to say so. The American Ambassadorin London in this period was Joseph Kennedy, the deeply crooked father of JohnF. Kennedy. The Kennedy’s are an Elite bloodline going back to the Irish kingsand beyond. To complete the set, the British ambassadors in America during thewar were Lord Lothian of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and LordHalifax of the Royal Institute, Round Table, and Committee of 300. FranklinRoosevelt won a second term as President in 1937 by repeating over and over thatthe sons of America were not going to fight in another war in Europe, while heknew full well that that was exactly what they were going to do. RepresentativePhilip Bennett of Missouri told Congress:“But our boys are not going to be sent abroad, says the President. Nonsense, MrChairman; even now their berths are being built in our transport ships. Even nowthe tags for identification of the dead and wounded are being printed by thefirm of William C. Ballantyne and Co of Washington.”23[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869014]Roosevelt had come to power for the second time by saying that America would notfight in another war in Europe and so when he returned to the White House he hada public relations problem because he was already helping to arrange that verywar. As with Woodrow Wilson and the sinking of the Lusitania, aproblem-reactionsolution was organised to give him the excuse to break his‘promises’. In 1939, Senator P. Nye of North Dakota said that he had seen aseries of volumes called The Next War, including one called Propaganda In TheNext War which originated in London (of course!). It revealed the game plan formanipulating America into the Second World War. This document, written betweenthe wars, said:“To persuade her (the United States) to take our part will be much moredifficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definitethreat to America, a threat moreover, which will have to be brought home bypropaganda to every citizen, before the Republic will again take arms in anexternal quarrel…“…The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan (my emphasis) wereinvolved, and this might and probably would bring America in without furtherado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our propagandiststo achieve this, just as in the Great War they succeeded in embroiling theUnited States against Germany.“Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirelysincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearlyenunciate our belief in the democratic form of government, and our firm resolveto adhere to… the old goddess of democracy routine.”24[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869179]On December 7th 1941, Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and theUnited States entered the war. It has since been established that manyintercepted messages gave Roosevelt considerable prior warning of the Japaneseattack, but no action was taken and Americans were left to die for the sake ofthe Brotherhood Agenda as literally billions of people have these past fewthousand years. The attack itself came after a long campaign by the Americans togoad Japan into attacking them. Henry Stimson, Roosevelt’s Secretary of War anda founder of the Council on Foreign Relations, had said: “We face the delicatequestion of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure Japan is put into thewrong and makes the first bad overt move.”25[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869326]That is the brief summary of how the Second World War was visited upon theplanet and how tens of millions of men, women, and children, lost their lives.The climax was to drop two atomic bombs on Japan which had already agreed tosurrender on the very same terms it eventually agreed to after the bombs hadcaused such devastation. Again the detailed background to all this is in …AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free. The man who ordered those bombs to be dropped wasPresident Harry S. Truman who had replaced Franklin Roosevelt at the end of thewar. Truman was a 33rd degree Freemason and when he reached that level he addedthe middle ‘S’ which stood for Solomon. Truman was a failed haberdasher anddeemed unemployable before the Freemasons launched his career. His mother losther farm because of his debts and when he became President he used to go onnightly drunken binges around the back alleys of Washington followed at adiscreet distance by two FBI agents despatched by J. Edgar Hoover to look afterhim.26 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869493] Truman’s career took offafter he became chief organiser of the Freemasonic lodges in Missouri and thenhe was nominated to become a judge before moving into the White House.27[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869605] The man behind this meteoric risewas another Mason and the head of organised crime in Kansas City, BossPrendergast.28 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869689] Truman’s closestconfidant was David Niles, or Neyhus, who had one sister in an importantposition in the government of Israel and another making policy in Moscow!29[../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869773] This is the background to Harry S.Truman, the Freemason placeman, who refused to accept Japan’s terms ofsurrender, ordered the atomic devastation, and then accepted the surrender onthe same terms he had refused before. The bombs were dropped because as onephase ended in the reptilian Agenda, another was immediately begun – the ColdWar – and it is so much easier to engender the fear necessary for that if peoplehave seen for themselves what happens when one of these devices explodes.After the war, the world was mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physicallydevastated. This allowed the banks to make vast fortunes lending money togovernments to rebuild the societies destroyed by a war the same banks hadfunded. This massively increased the debt owed by nations to private banks andthe control over those countries increased in proportion. The desperation forpeace made the world open to the main reason the Brotherhood had created the war– the formation of the United Nations. Problem-reaction-solution (see Figure22). The charter for the United Nations, the global body the Brotherhood sobadly wanted, was written by a committee of the Council on Foreign Relations.The writer, James Perloff, revealed the background to the UN in his 1988 book,The Shadows Of Power: The Council On Foreign Relations And The American Decline:“In January 1943, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, formed a steeringcommittee composed of himself, Leo Pasvolsky, Isaiah Bowman, Sumner Welles,Norman Davis, and Morton Taylor. All these men – with the exception of Hull –were in the CFR. Later known as the Informal Agenda Group, they drafted theoriginal proposal of the United Nations. It was Bowman – a founder of the CFRand a founder of Colonel House’s old ‘Inquiry’ (another Elite grouping) – whofirst put forward the concept. They called in three attorneys, all CFR men, whoruled that it was constitutional. Then they discussed it with Franklin D.Roosevelt on June 15th 1944. The President approved the plan and announced it tothe public the next day.”30 [../Text/index_split_031.html#filepos869857][../Images/00063.jpg]Figure 22: The Second World War. The only winner was the Babylonian Brotherhood.In his book, The American Language, H. L. Mencken suggests that the term ‘UnitedNations’ was decided by President Roosevelt during a meeting with WinstonChurchill at the White House in December 1941, shortly before the attack onPearl Harbor. When the United Nations was officially formed in San Francisco onJune 26th 1945, the US delegation included 74 members of the CFR, including JohnJ. McCloy, the CFR chairman from 1953-70, a member of the Committee of 300,chairman of the Ford Foundation and the Rockefellers’ Chase Manhattan Bank, andfriend and advisor to nine presidents from Roosevelt to Reagan. Also there wereJohn Foster Dulles, the Hitler supporter, CFR founder, and soon-to-be USSecretary of State, and Nelson Rockefeller, the Satanist and arch manipulator,who was four times Governor of New York and Vice President to Gerald Ford afterRichard Nixon was ousted by Watergate. Remember, too, that while the CFR createdthe United Nations, it is still only a branch of the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs in London, which is only an offshoot of the Round Table,which is only an agency of an even higher authority in the hierarchy. TheRockefellers paid for the headquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva andnow they gave the land for the United Nations building in New York. The land hadpreviously been used for a slaughter house and that was exactly what theSatanists of the Brotherhood wanted. Land covered in blood, fear, and pain, forthe foundations of the organisation designed to do the same to human beings.The UN is a Trojan Horse for world government and it sits atop a vast network oforganisations which present themselves as serving the people when in fact theyare fronts for the most grotesque manipulation, not least in the developingworld of Africa, Asia, South and Central America. The UN network includes theWorld Health Organisation (WHO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of theAnglo-American-Swiss pharmaceutical cartel with its interlocking leadership. TheWHO tell the world there is going to be an epidemic of something or other andits controllers, the pharmaceutical corporations, provide the vaccine. Anotherproblem-reactionsolution and the vaccines are causing untold harm to thephysical and spiritual well being of billions. The UN Population Fund uses‘population control’ for a policy of eugenics against people with black facesand those with white faces who are not up to the genetic ‘purity’ (reptilianbloodline) demanded by these deeply imbalanced people. The UN EnvironmentProgramme uses the environment as an excuse to create international laws, takecontrol of great swathes of land, and steal land from developing countries underthe heading of ‘debt for nature’ swaps. UNESCO, the science and cultureoperation, advances the Agenda across many areas of life. Now the UnitedNations, which was set up to stop war, according to the propaganda, is actuallygoing to war. This happened in the Gulf when American, British and Frenchsoldiers and pilots killed untold thousands of Iraqi civilians under the bannerof the UN flag.Today the latest of the stooges wheeled in to be UN Secretary-general is KofiAnnan, a black man who ought to be disgusted at what his organisation is doingto his African continent. An advisor is Maurice Strong, the Canadian oil tycoon,Rockefeller clone, and manipulator extraordinaire, not least of the environmentmovement. The United Nations is there for the good of the world? Yes, sure itis. Oh look, another pig goes flying by."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_030.html#filepos797291] Dr John Coleman, Committee Of300, The Conspirators Hierarchy (Joseph Holding Company, Nevada, USA, 1995).2 [../Text/index_split_030.html#filepos801990] Fritz Springmeier and CiscoWheeler, The Illuminati Formula To Create An Undetectable Total Mind ControlledSlave (Springmeier, S.E.

This is no surprise because the NaziParty was the creation of a network of secret societies which had access to theunderground stream of knowledge that carries the true, or truer, story of humanorigins.Germany has long been a centre for esoteric thinking and secret societies and,as we have seen, among the most prominent occult families in Middle Ages Germanywere the Bauers, a strand of which changed their name to Rothschild. Much of theWindsor blood also comes via Germany. The Bavarian Illuminati, which wasinvolved in many of the ‘people’s’ revolutions in Europe, including the French,was founded in Germany on May 1st 1776 by the occultist, Adam Weishaupt, and theChristian Church was split into Catholics and Protestants by Martin Luther, theGerman agent for the Rosicrucian Order. Germany is another centre for globalmanipulation. Hitler was not the creator of Nazi belief, merely the publicexpression of it. In the 19th century one of the pre-Hitler prophets was thecomposer Richard Wagner, and his composition, The Ride Of The Valkyries,captures his obsession with the invading powers of evil. Wagner declared theimminent arrival of the Master Race. His work, The Ring, was the musicalexpression of his belief in German ‘supermen’ bestriding the world stage likethe ancient Pagan gods, Wotan and Thor. Hitler would later say that tounderstand Nazi Germany, one had to know Wagner. One of the students ofmaster-race fanatic Wagner, was the composer, Gustav Mahler. His studies withWagner were funded by Baron Albert de Rothschild. One of the places to whichWagner travelled and researched was Rennes-le-Chateau, that mysterious villagein southern France so connected to the Knights Templar and the Cathars. Indeed,the German secret society underground is closely aligned to the Templartraditions and those contemporaries of the original Templars, the TeutonicKnights.Adolf Hitler was officially born in 1889 at Braunau-am-Inn, on the border ofGermany and the Austria-Hungary Empire. But, wait for this, Hitler was actuallya Rothschild! Yes, a Rothschild (see Appendix II for the background). Theesoteric became a consuming passion for Hitler, especially in his rise to power.He was strongly influenced by the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, who wasborn in the Ukraine in 1831 and later, one reliable researcher told me, becamean agent for British Intelligence. Other researchers claim she had connectionswith the secret society of Italian revolutionaries, the Carbonari, who wereclosely linked to the Black Nobility, and she was a member of the Egyptiansociety, the Brotherhood of Luxor, which she later denounced as “a den fordisgusting immorality, greediness for selfish power, and moneymaking”. MadamBlavatsky arrived in New York in 1873 and, with the help of a Colonel HenryOlcott, she founded the Theosophical Society two years later. This is stillaround today. The Theosophical Society’s headquarters in America were inCalifornia at Krotona. The Pythagorean mystery school in ancient Greece was atCrotona. Blavatsky’s society was yet another mystery school derivative. Itsdoctrines are based on Blavatsky’s books such as Isis Unveiled, which waswritten in 1877, and The Secret Doctrine, published in 1888, which arethemselves based on the Hebrew Cabala. She claimed to be in psychic contact withhidden masters or supermen. These hidden masters, she said, lived in centralAsia and could be contacted telepathically by those who knew the secret to theesoteric mysteries. Today we call this process of communication ‘channelling’.There are many UFO sightings and much research which indicate that there aresecret underground and underwater bases for extraterrestrials around the world,central Asia among them. This connects with the endless legends and ancienttraditions all over the world of a Master Race living within the Earth. Thebelief in the Masters and the Great White Brotherhood of discarnate entitiespromoted by people like the Theosophical psychic of the post-Blavatsky period,Alice Bailey, is a theme that remains well entrenched in what is known today asthe New Age movement. Alice Bailey founded the Arcane esoteric school. Sheclaimed to ‘channel’ an entity she called the ‘Tibetan’ and she produced anumber of books including Hierarchy Of The Masters, The Seven Rays, A New GroupOf World Servers, and New World Religion. Bailey said that her Tibetan Masterhad told her the Second World War was necessary to defend the plan of God. Thatsounds ridiculous to me, but there are many in the New Age field who believethat everything is part of ‘the plan’ and the will of God, even a globalholocaust. It seems like a great excuse to do nothing and a cop out of megaproportions. We create our own reality and if we change our inner self we willchange its outer reflection. Inner peace = outer peace. Wars don’t have tohappen as part of some plan of God. We create them and if we change our innerself, our attitudes, we can stop creating them. It’s just a choice. My own viewis that the Masters, the Great White Brotherhood, and this whole concept issomething to be deeply wary of. Whenever I hear the term ‘Master’ I cringe.Two organisations spawned by Alice Bailey’s work, the Lucis Trust (formerly theLucifer Trust) and the World Goodwill Organisation, are both staunch promotersof the United Nations. They are almost UN ‘groupies’, such is their devotion. Itis interesting to see how the New Age has inherited ‘truths’ over the decades inthe same way that conventional religion has done over the centuries. As thefollowers of Christianity have inherited the manipulated version of Jesus, soNew Agers have inherited the Masters. There is too little checking of origins,too much acceptance of inherited belief, I think. Certainly there is with theMasters and Blavatsky’s Great White Brotherhood because she admitted incorrespondence with her sister, that she had made up their names by using thenicknames of the Rosicrucians and Freemasons who were funding her. Yet today allover the world there are hundreds of thousands (at least) of New Age‘channellers’ who claim to be communicating with these Masters and with theArchangel Michael who is an ancient deity of the Phoenicians. If the New Ageisn’t careful, it will be Christianity revisited. It is already becoming so. Ibelieve that the concept of Masters can be a means through which those who haverejected the status quo of religion and science can still have their mindscontrolled.Another big influence on Hitler was the novel, The Coming Race, by theEnglishman, Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), a British colonial ministerheavily involved in imposing opium addiction on the Chinese. He was a closefriend of the British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, and the writer, CharlesDickens, and was Grand Patron of the English Rosicrucian Society, which includedFrancis Bacon and John Dee among its earlier membership. Bulwer-Lytton was alsoa Grand Master of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry and the head of BritishIntelligence. One of his operatives was Helena Blavatsky, a contact told me, andBulwer-Lytton is often referred to in her book, Isis Unveiled. He is best knownfor his work, The Last Days Of Pompeii, but his passion was the world ofesoteric magic. In The Coming Race, he wrote of an enormous civilisation insidethe Earth, well ahead of our own. They had discovered a power called ‘Vril’which, by the use of the psyche, could be used to perform ‘miracles’. Theseunderground supermen would, according to Bulwer-Lytton’s novel, emerge on thesurface one day and take control of the world. Many Nazis believed this. Thethemes of underground supermen, or hidden masters, can be found in most of thesecret societies and in legends across the world. Certainly this was true of theOrder of the Golden Dawn, formed in 1888 by Dr Wynn Westcott, a Freemason, andS.L. Mathers. They called their Masters the Secret Chiefs. This supports theancient and modern theme of extraterrestrials or inner-Earth races livingunderground. Mathers devised a series of rituals and initiations designed tohelp his members access their full psychic and physical potential. He believed,however, that this gift was only for the few and he was a supporter ofauthoritarian government. These rituals would have attracted the extremenegative energies which allowed vibrational synchronisation – possession – withthe reptilians or other lower fourth dimensional ‘astral’ entities which residethere. This is one of the main reasons for such black magic initiations, to plugin the initiate’s consciousness to the reptilians and others in the lower fourthdimension. In the mid 1890s, there were temples of the Order of the Golden Dawnin London, Edinburgh, Bradford, Weston Super Mare, and Paris, where Mathers madehis home. The Golden Dawn also spoke of the Vril force and one of their secretsigns was the pointed-arm salute which the Nazis used when saying “Heil Hitler”.It was yet another source of the esoteric foundations on which Nazism was built.Mathers had known Madam Blavatsky and so had the Master of the Order’s LondonTemple, the poet William Butler Yeats, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize.Remnants of the Order of the Golden Dawn continue to this day, but the originalversion splintered after a row between Yeats, Mathers, and the arch Satanist,Aleister Crowley, which split the membership into quarrelling factions. Othersignificant thinkers and groups which influenced the gathering Nazi philosophyincluded the Order of the Oriental Templars (OTO), which used sex rituals tocreate and harness the energy known as Vril, and two German esoteric magicians,Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. In his summer solstice celebrations,List used wine bottles on the ground to form the symbol of the Hermetic Cross,also known as the Hammer of Thor. It was the Badge of Power in the Order of theGolden Dawn and we know this symbol as the swastika, the ancient Sun symbol ofthe Phoenician-Aryans. Lanz von Liebenfels (real name Adolf Lanz), used theswastika on a flag which flew over his ‘temple’ overlooking the Danube, and forthese two black magicians it symbolised the end of Christianity and the dawningof the age of the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Aryan supermen. They believed in theracial inferiority of those they called the ‘dark forces’, such as the Jews, theSlavs, and the Negroes. Lebenfels recommended castration for these people. Thetwo vons, List and Liebenfels, were to have a massive influence on Adolf Hitler.In 1932, with Hitler on the verge of power, von Liebenfels would write to afellow believer:“Hitler is one of our pupils… you will one day experience that he, and throughhim we, will one day be victorious and develop a movement that will make theworld tremble.”1 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos938872]Two others who would influence the thinking and beliefs of Adolf Hitler were theEnglishmen, Aleister Crowley and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Crowley was bornin Warwickshire in 1875. He rebelled against a strict religious upbringing andwas initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn in 1898 after leaving CambridgeUniversity. He left the Order after the row with its founders and travelled toMexico, India, and Ceylon, where he was introduced to yoga and Buddhism. He alsobecame a record-breaking mountaineer. Buddhism replaced his interest in theoccult until an experience in Cairo in April 1904. Crowley was asked by hiswife, Rose, to perform an esoteric ritual to see what happened. During theceremony she entered a trance-like state and began to channel the words of acommunicator. “They are waiting for you” she said to Crowley. The “They”, shesaid, was Horus, the god of war and the son of Osiris, in ancient Egyptianbelief. Crowley did not accept any of this and asked his wife a series ofdetailed questions in an effort to trick her. But Rose, who apparently knewlittle of the esoteric, gave the correct answer every time, according to theofficial story. The reptilians were on the line again. The communicator toldCrowley to be at a desk in his hotel room between noon and one oclock on threespecific days. He agreed and in these periods he wrote, via automatic writing, adocument called the Book Of The Law. Automatic writing is when your arm and handare guided by another force and often no-one is more surprised at what they arewriting than the person involved. Crowley’s communication said that the old ageof Osiris was being replaced by the new age of Horus. But it said the old agewould first have to be destroyed by barbarism and the Earth bathed in blood.There would be a world war, he was told. The Book Of The Law taught of a race ofsupermen and condemned the old religions, pacifism, democracy, compassion, andhumanitarianism. “Let my servants be few and secret: They shall rule the manyand the known”, the ‘superman’ continued. The message went on:“We have nothing with the outcasts and the unfit; let them die in their misery,for they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings; stamp down the wretched andthe weak; this is the law of the strong; this is our law and the joy of theworld… Love one another with burning hearts; on the low men trample in thefierce lust of your pride in the day of your wrath… Pity not the fallen! I neverknew them. I am not for them. I console not; I hate the consoled and theconsoler…“I am unique and conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damnedand dead. Amen… therefore strike hard and low and to hell with them, master…Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! This is the law of the battle of conquest; thus shallmy worship be about my secret house… Worship me with fire and blood; worship mewith swords and with spears. Let the woman be gurt with a sword before me; letblood flow in my name. Trample down the heathen; be upon them, O warrior, I willgive you their flesh to eat… Sacrifice cattle, little and big; after a child…kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!.”2[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939101]The classic sentiments of the lower fourth dimensional reptilians and theSatanic rings which serve them. If all that sounds remarkably like some of theangry God stuff in the Old Testament, that’s because it was the same force whichcommunicated to the ancients, to Crowley, and to anyone else on that vibrationwho would help to stimulate the conflict of human misery on which these reptilesfeed. This is the force that controls the consciousness of those which havecontrolled the Babylonian Brotherhood since ancient times. When you read thatdiatribe, you will appreciate the mentality that can set out to create thehorrors which have plagued the human race. Crowley apparently tried to ignorewhat he had written with his guided hand, but it would not go away, and from1909 on he began to take it seriously. Very seriously. He said:“After five years of folly and weakness, miss-called politeness, tact,discretion, care for the feeling of others, O I am weary of it. I say today: tohell with Christianity, rationalism, Buddhism, all the lumber of the centuries.I bring you a positive and primeval fact, Magic by name; and with this I willbuild me a new heaven and new Earth. I want none of your faint approval or faintdispraise; I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything, bad or good,but strong.”Crowley left his former tutor, MacGregor Mathers, a broken man as he embarked ona psychic war against him. They both conjured up ‘demons’ to attack the other,but Mathers lost out. Such psychic wars are very much part of the Brotherhoodarmoury today. They war psychically with each other, but overwhelmingly with thepopulation and people who are challenging their power. I have experienced suchattacks myself and I understand how they can kill people in this way. But theywon’t kill me and they had better understand that. Crowley’s communicators wouldalso take over the psyches of Adolf Hitler and other architects of Nazism. Longafter his death, Crowley would become a hero to many involved in the FlowerPower period of the 1960s, when the young were calling for love and peace. Theirony is not lost. Crowley welcomed the First World War as necessary to sweepaway the old age and usher in the new one. After going public with hisrevelations, Crowley was made the world head of the Germany-based, Order of theOriental Templars (OTO), and this gave him very significant influence amonglike-thinkers in Germany. At the same time as he and his organisation wereinfluencing the Nazis, Crowley was a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason and anagent of the British Intelligence operation, MI6.3[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939296] He was an advisor to his fellowSatanist, Winston Churchill.Houston Stewart Chamberlain (Comm 300) was born in England in 1855, but moved toGermany in 1882. In 1908 he married Eva, the daughter of Richard Wagner, andbecame a prestigious writer. His best known work was Foundations Of TheNineteenth Century which ran to 1,200 pages and sold more than 250,000 copies.It made him famous throughout the country. He was, however, a troubled man whohad a series of nervous breakdowns. He felt himself to be taken over by demonsand his books were written in a trance and a fever, which suggests that he waslocked into the reptilians or another low vibrational consciousness viaautomatic writing. In his autobiography, he said he did not recognise suchwriting as his own. The themes of his work are very familiar: all civilisationcomes from the Aryan race and the Germans were the purist of all; Jews were theenemy who would pollute the Aryan bloodlines (yawn). Kaiser Wilhelm II and AdolfHitler said Chamberlain was a prophet. He became the principle advisor to KaiserWilhelm and urged the king to go to war in 1914 to fulfil the prophecy ofGermany’s world domination. When the war was over and Wilhelm had abdicated, herealised how he had been manipulated. Wilhelm gathered together a mass of bookson the occult and the German secret societies and he was convinced that they hadconspired to create the First World War and caused Germany to be defeated.Chamberlain, who had been awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser, died in 1927after years in a wheelchair broken in body and spirit. This is something thatoften happens to those who are used as vehicles and channels for this highlymalevolent branch of the reptilian consciousness. It eventually destroys them.But Chamberlain’s influence was to live on in the mind of Adolf Hitler. He hadbeen introduced to Hitler by Alfred Rosenberg, the refugee from Russia andanother Satanist figure. It was Rosenberg, despite his ‘Jewish’ background, whogave a copy of the Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion to Hitler via anotheroccultist, Dietrich Eckart.4 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939410] TheProtocols were used by Hilter to justify his campaign against the Jews.These were some of the people and beliefs that moulded the thinking of the manclaiming to be a young Austrian called Schiklgruber, but later rather betterknown as Adolf Hitler. “Heil Schiklgruber” would not have had the same ring toit somehow. He hated school, the official story goes, and wanted to be anartist, an ambition that took him to Vienna. He spent hours in the librariesreading books on astrology, mysticism, and the religions of the East. He wasfascinated by the books of Blavatsky, Chamberlain, List, and Liebenfels and hepicked out parts from each of them to produce his preferred mixture, a cocktailof horror and hatred called Nazism. His passion was the power of the will. Thepotential of willpower to achieve anything it desires was to be his focus andguide throughout the years that followed. Put another way, creating your ownreality. He practised the esoteric arts in his effort to access the level ofconsciousness he was convinced would turn him into one of the supermen he hadread so much about and believed in so much. His psyche became locked into thereptilian vibration more powerfully than before. He was possessed, probablyduring some black ritual which opened his psyche to the reptilians. As aRothschild he would have been a reptilian bloodline anyway. You only have tolook at his beliefs to see that he would have had great potential for‘vibrational compatibility’ with this consciousness. It was now that anuncharismatic and ineffectual man would begin to exude the charisma andmagnetism that would captivate and intoxicate a nation.We talk of some people having magnetism and ‘magnetic personalities’ and that isexactly what they have. We are all generating magnetic energies. Some peopletransmit powerful magnetism and others less so. Negative energies are just asmagnetic as positive. Those connected to, and therefore generating, the extremenegative vibration, will be very magnetic. You often hear highly negative peopledescribed as having a magnetic personality or a ‘fatal attraction’. This is why.It is also where the magnetism and charisma of Adolf Hitler suddenly appearedfrom. When he was standing on a public platform, with that contorted face andcrazed delivery, he was channelling the reptilian consciousness and transmittingthis vibration to the vast crowds. This affected the vibrational state of thepeople and turned them into equally crazed agents of hatred. It is the piedpiper principle, using vibrational frequencies. As one writer said of Hitler:“His power to bewitch an audience has been likened to the occult art of theAfrican medicine man or the Asiatic shaman; others have compared it to thesensitivity of a medium, and the magnetism of a hypnotist.”5[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939589]And Hermann Rauschning, an aide to Hitler, said in his book, Hitler Speaks:“One cannot help thinking of him as a medium. For most of the time, mediums areordinary, insignificant people. Suddenly they are endowed with what seem to besupernatural powers which set them apart from the rest of humanity. The mediumis possessed. Once the crisis is passed, they fall back again into mediocrity.It was in this way, beyond any doubt, that Hitler was possessed by forcesoutside of himself – almost demoniacal forces of which the individual man Hitlerwas only the temporary vehicle. The mixture of the banal and the supernaturalcreated that insupportable duality of which one was conscious in his presence…It was like looking at a bizarre face whose expression seemed to reflect anunbalanced state of mind coupled with a disquieting impression of hiddenpowers.”6 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939745]Hitler appeared to live in perpetual fear of the ‘supermen’. Rauschning told howHitler suffered from terrible nightmares and would wake in terror screamingabout entities who were invisible to all but him. Hitler once said to his aide:“What will the social order of the future be like? Comrade, I will tell you.There will be a class of overlords, after them the rank and file of the partymembers in hierarchical order, and then the great mass of anonymous followers,servants and workers in perpetuity, and beneath them again all the conqueredforeign races, the modern slaves. And over and above all these will reign a newand exalted nobility of whom I cannot speak… but of all these plans the militantmembers will know nothing. The new man is living amongst us now! He is here.Isn’t that enough for you? I will tell you a secret. I have seen the new man. Heis intrepid and cruel. I was afraid of him.”7[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939879]This is the society planned by the reptilians and their reptile-Aryan masterrace if we allow the New World Order to be introduced in the next few years.Hitler’s ‘secret chiefs’ are the reptilians and note the obsession withhierarchy and ritual, character traits of the R-complex or reptile brain. AfterHitler moved to Germany, he spent a lot of time in Bavaria, from whenceWeishaupt’s Illuminati had sprung and he returned there after the First WorldWar. That’s the official line, anyway. The following year, he came across a tinyand rather pathetic political party called the German Workers Party. This was anoffshoot of an esoteric secret society called the German Order, which wasfiercely nationalistic and anti-Jewish. Out of this order came other similarsocieties, including the infamous Thule-Gesellschaft (Thule Society) and theLuminous Lodge or Vril Society. Hitler was a member of both. Vril was the namegiven by the English writer, Lord Bulwer-Lytton to the force in the blood which,he claimed, awakens people to their true power and potential to become supermen.So what is the Vril force in the blood? It was known by the Hindus as the‘serpent force’ and it relates to the genetic make up of the body which allowsshape-shifting and conscious interdimensional travel. The Vril force is, yetagain, related to the reptile-human bloodlines. In 1933, the rocket expert,Willi Ley, fled from Germany and revealed the existence of the Vril Society andthe Nazis’ belief that they would become the equals of the supermen in thebowels of the Earth by use of esoteric teachings and mind expansion. Theybelieved this would reawaken the Vril force sleeping in the blood. The initiatesof the Vril Society included two men who would become famous Nazis, HeinrichHimmler and Hermann Goering. Vril members were convinced they were in alliancewith mysterious esoteric lodges in Tibet and one of the so-called ‘unknownsupermen’ who was referred to as the King of Fear. Rudolph Hess,8[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos939962] Hitler’s deputy Fuhrer until hemade his ill-fated flight to England in 1941, was a dedicated occultist and amember, with Hermann Goering, of the Edelweiss Society, a sect which believed inthe Nordic master race. Hess worshipped Hitler as the ‘messiah’, although how hecould do this when the Fuhrer was hardly blue-eyed and blond-haired is notclear. Hitler had the same problem in equating the two, but he would have foundsome ridiculous explanation for it, I’m sure. The inner core of the Nazi secretsociety network was the Black Order which continues today and is reported to bethe innermost circle of the CIA.9 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos940407]The German researcher, Jan van Helsing, writes in his book, Secret Societies OfThe 20th Century, 10 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos940593] of how theVril and Thule societies believed they were corresponding with extraterrestrialsthrough two mediums known as Maria Orsic and Sigrun in a lodge nearBerchtesgaden in December 1919. According to Vril documents, he says, thesechannellings were transmitted from a solar system called Aldebaran, 68 lightyears away in the constellation of Taurus where two inhabited planets formed the‘Sumeran’ empire. The population of Aldebaran is divided into a master race ofblond-haired, blue-eyed, Aryans, known as Light God People and several otherhuman-like races which had mutated to a lower genetic form due to climaticchanges, the channellings said.11 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos940753]In excess of 500 million years ago the Aldebaran sun began to expand so creatinga tremendous increase in heat. The ‘lower’ races were evacuated and taken toother inhabitable planets. Then the Aryan Light God People began to coloniseEarth-like planets after theirs became uninhabitable. In our solar system it wassaid that they first occupied the planet, Mallona, also known as Marduk/Mardek,and by the Russians and Romans, Phaeton, which, they said, existed between Marsand Jupiter in what is now the asteroid belt. This corresponds with the Sumerianaccounts of the planet, Tiamat. The Vril Society believed that later this raceof blond-haired, blue-eyed Aldebarans, colonised Mars before landing on theEarth and starting the Sumerian civilisation. The Vril channellers said that theSumerian language was identical to that of the Aldebarans and sounded like“unintelligible German”. The language frequency of German andSumerian-Aldebaranian were almost identical, they believed.12[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos940848] The details may change in eachversion, but here we see the same basic theme yet again. A blond-haired,blue-eyed master race of extraterrestrials land on the Earth from Mars andbecome the gods of ancient legend. They become the inspiration behind theadvanced Sumerian culture and spawned the purest genetic stream on the planet.These same gods have controlled the planet ever since from their undergroundcities. What I think has been missed, however, is that within the Aryan streamare the reptile-Aryan bloodlines. I know from Brotherhood insiders that thereptilians need the blood for some reason of the blond-haired, blue-eyed people,and the Nazi obsession with the Master Race may have been designed to keep thisstream pure and discourage interbreeding with other streams and races.The Thule Society was named after Ultima Thule which is claimed to be themythical city on Hyperborea, the first continent settled by the extraterrestrialAryan race from Aldebaran, they believed. Some say this was long before Atlantisand Lemuria, others say Hyperborea was Atlantis or even the inner-Earth.Scandinavian legend describes Ultima Thule as a wonderful land in the far Northwhere the Sun never sets and the ancestors of the Aryans have their home. WhenHyperborea started to sink, the legend goes, the Aryan extraterrestrials usedtheir highly advanced technology to burrow gigantic tunnels into the Earth’scrust and they settled under the Himalayan Mountains. This realm became known asAgharta with a capital city called Shamballah, the Thule advocates believe. ThePersians called this area Aryana, the land of the Aryans. The Nazi belief systemclaimed that the people of Agharta were good and those of Shamballah were evil.The two had been in conflict for thousands of years and the Nazis believed theywere backing the ‘good guys’ of Agharta against the ‘Freemasons and Zionists’ ofShamballah. Could this division be Aryan Martians v Anunnaki reptilians, as anage old conflict between the two continues? First they battled on Mars,apparently, then the Moon and now Earth. Hitler was obsessed with finding theentrances to this subterranean world so he could contact the Aryan master race,but the truth is that he was a reptilian puppet controlled by the ‘Angel ofDeath’, Josef Mengele. It is highly likely, as I mentioned early on, that thereptilians are in conflict with other extraterrestrial or inner-terrestrialraces for control of the planet and there will certainly be many competingfactions in the consciousness cesspit of the lower fourth dimension. A founderof the Thule Society was Rudolf Glauer, an astrologer, who changed his name tothe grand-sounding Baron von Sebottendorff. His demands for a revolution againstJews and the Marxists turned the Thule Society into a focus for the anti-Jew,anti-Marxist, German master-racers. Out of all this came the German WorkersParty which would one day become the Nazi Party. Another committed occultist andfriend of Sebottendorff now becomes highly significant. This was DietrichEckart, a heavy-drinking, drug-taking writer who believed he was here to pavethe way for a dictator of Germany. He met Hitler in 1919 and decided he was theone, the ‘messiah’, he was looking for. It is Eckart who is credited withHitler’s advanced esoteric knowledge and probably the black magic rituals whichplugged him so completely into the reptilian frequency. From now on, Hitler’spower to attract support grew rapidly. Eckart wrote to a friend in 1923:“Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We havegiven him the means of communication with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shallhave influenced history more than any other German.”13[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos940939]Another of Hitler’s obsessions was the so-called Spear of Destiny, the weaponalleged to have been used to pierce the side of ‘Jesus’ at the crucifixion. Hestole what is claimed to be the spear when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 andit was taken to Nuremberg. The legend says that whoever has this spear anddecodes its secrets will have control of the world for good or evil. The onethat Hitler stole is now in the Hofburg Museum in Vienna, where there was amajor fire in November 1992, seven days before the blaze which destroyed part ofWindsor Castle. Heinrich Himmler was another dedicated occultist who was intoall matters esoteric. He used this knowledge in the blackest of ways. Himmlerwas particularly interested in the rune stones, a system of divination in whichstones carrying symbols are thrown or selected and the choice or combination‘read’ by an ‘expert’. It was Himmler who formed the notorious SS and, as withthe swastika, he chose an esoteric symbol for his horrific organisation and thiswas the double S or sig rune which looks like two flashes of lightning. The SSwas a virtually self contained body and the epitome of all the esotericknowledge in which the Nazis believed so passionately. Only those consideredracially pure were allowed to join, and instruction in the esoteric arts,including the rune stones, was fundamental to their training. The SS was run andgoverned as a black magic secret society. Their rituals were taken from otherssuch as the Jesuits and the Knights Templar. The highest ranking initiates werethe 13 (here we go again) members of the Grand Council of Knights led by theirGrand Master, Heinrich Himmler, and the black rituals were performed at theancient castle of Wewelsberg in Westphalia. They celebrated the rituals of theNordic Pagans and the summer solstice. Here they worshipped Satan, Lucifer, Set,whichever name you prefer. Prince Bernhard, one of founders of the Brotherhoodfront, the Bilderberg Group, and an extremely close friend of Prince Philip, wasin the SS. Black magic and the esoteric arts pervaded all that Hitler and theNazis did, even down to the use of pendulums on maps to identify the positionsof enemy troops. The original swastika Sun symbol was right handed which, inesoteric terms, means light and creation, the positive. The Nazis reversed it tosymbolise black magic and destruction. This is the classic reversed symbolism ofSatanism which does precisely the same. The inverted pentagram is but oneexample. The mass rallies that Hitler used so effectively were designed with theknowledge of the human psyche and how it can be manipulated. In the book, SatanAnd Swastika, Francis King says:“Hitler’s public appearances, particularly those associated with the NaziParty’s Nuremberg Rallies, were excellent examples of this sort of magicalceremony. The fanfares, military marches, and Wagnerian music, all emphasisedthe idea of German military glory. The mass swastika banners in black, white,and red, filled the consciousness of the participants in the rally with nationalsocialist ideology. The ballet-like precision of the movement of the uniformedparty members, all acting in unison, evoked from the unconscious, the principlesof war and violence which the ancients symbolised as Mars. And the prime ritualsof the rallies – Hitler clasping to other banners the ‘blood banner’ carried inthe Munich Putsch of 1923 – was a quasi-magical ceremony designed to link upminds of living Nazis with the archetypal images symbolised by the dead nationalsocialist heroes of the past. The religio-magical aspects of the rallies wereemphasised by the fact that their high points were reached after dusk and tookplace in a ‘Cathedral of Light’ – an open space surrounded by pillars of lightcoming from electric searchlights pointed upwards to the sky. If a modern ritualmagician of the utmost expertise had designed a ritual intended to ‘invoke Mars’he could not have come up with anything more effective than the ceremonies usedat Nuremberg.”And what applied then, applies now, the esoteric knowledge used by the Nazis formass hypnosis on the German people, is being used today to expand the globalhypnosis on the human race. Symbols, words, colours, sounds and techniques ofwhich the public are not even aware, are being used in the media and advertisingto hypnotise us. The propaganda ministry of Joseph Goebbels was based on theesoteric knowledge of the human psyche. He knew that people will believeanything if you tell them often enough and if you can engineer events whichcreate the ‘something must be done’ mentality in the public mind. He usedcolours, symbols and slogans, to great effect. The slogans were used likemantras and repeated over and over again, hypnotising the mass psyche. Allalternative views and information were censored and the people were programmedto respond as desired. What is the difference between that and the constantdrip, drip, drip, of inaccurate and biased information that is fed to us and ourchildren today? It may not have a swastika on it, but it is still masshypnotism. It would seem to be a contradiction that Hitler sought to destroysecret societies like the Freemasons and to prevent the use of esotericknowledge in German society, but it isn’t. He knew as much as anyone the poweravailable to those with the understanding, and he wanted to keep that forhimself. In 1934, all forms of fortune telling were banned in Berlin and lateresoteric books were banned throughout Germany. Secret societies were disbandedand even the Thule Society and the German Order (which had together foundedNazism) were targeted. Astrologers were attacked and killed and people like Lanzvon Liebenfels were prevented from publishing their work. This purge had twomain motives: to distance Hitler and the Nazis from the occult in the minds ofthe public and other countries and, most importantly, to pull up the ladder andstop anyone else from using esoteric knowledge against them as they were usingit against others. This is a mirror of the tactics of the reptile-Aryansthroughout known history as they have used the knowledge to control and suppresswhile creating the religious dictatorships to take the same knowledge out ofpublic circulation. In truth, the Nazis were created and controlled at everylevel by the secret society underground and, ultimately, by the reptilians. Theybelieved the Sumerian gods were the extraterrestrial master race; they believedin the existence of Atlantis; and they launched expeditions to North Africa,Rennes-le-Chateau and Montsegur in Cathar country, and to Tibet, where theybelieved the underground supermen were based. There is a positive Buddhiststream of belief and a highly negative one. The Nazis connected with the latterand when the Russians arrived in Berlin at the end of the war they found manydead Buddhist monks who had been working with the Nazis.The hollow EarthThe Nazis also believed that the Earth was hollow with entrances at the polesand a number of researchers report that they established an underground base inAntarctica towards the end of the war which is still in operation today. I haveno doubt from the evidence I have seen that the Earth is hollow, or, at the veryleast, there are vast regions inside where highly developed civilisations live.I also feel that there are ancient societies living under the ground between theEarth’s surface and the inner ‘hollow’ centre. It is like three levels ofpeoples living on and within the same planet. The writer, Jules Verne, was ahigh initiate of the secret society network with his connections to theTheosophical Society, the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Order of theOriental Templars. Therefore, he knew far more than the public are allowed toknow. His science-fiction stories were based on fact. He wrote of the two moonsof Mars before they were identified (officially) in 1877. Verne’s epic, JourneyTo The Centre Of The Earth, was not entirely a fantasy. He knew the basis of itwas true. Those who promote the idea of a hollow Earth say that water flows fromone polar entrance to another and in the centre of the planet is a vast sea andan inner ‘central sun’ which provides the heat and light. In the film version ofthe Jules Verne story, which I watched again recently, the scene is depicted inthe same way. Interestingly, the main opposition Verne’s explorers face are frommassive reptiles, one of which they found in the sunken city of Atlantis. Therehas been speculation, supported by much evidence, that dinosaurs may havesurvived the cataclysm of 65 million years ago by living within the Earth,particular in the Southern polar regions. Tom Rich, a palaeontologist at theMuseum of Victoria, Australia, suggested this possibility after he discoveredthe fossilised remains of a polar dinosaur in 1987 in an excavated tunnel on theSouthern tip of Victoria state at a place known as Dinosaur Cove.14[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941052] Jules Verne, a high initiate, wouldhave known the true background and so much truth is passed on through symbolismin ‘fiction’ stories and movies. Steven Spielberg’s films are prime examples,particularly the Indiana Jones series and, I feel, Jurassic Park in which DNA ismanipulated to create reptilian dinosaurs. My view is that human DNA wasmanipulated to create reptilian-humans.[../Images/00065.jpg]Figure 23: A drawing of Donati’s comet in 1853 showing how the disintegratingmass is thrown outwards by centrifugal force to ‘orbit’ a central energy source.This leaves the interior hollow in the same way that clothing spins around ahollow centre in a washing machine or spin dryer. Surely this would havehappened when the Earth was forming also?There is certainly plenty of evidence that there are civilisations living withinthe Earth and even that the Earth is hollow. These are more themes of ancientknowledge and traditions. Humans have become such puppets of the official linethat to suggest the Earth is not solid to the core is to invite enormousridicule. After all, isn’t that at odds with what those highly intelligentscientists say? Yes it is, just as it was to suggest the Earth was round and notflat. When you research this subject you realise how little evidence thescientists produce for their indisputable ‘facts’. They have penetrated only afew miles into the Earth and their theories of what exists at deeper levels arejust that – theories. When you ask a few questions of the official line, it issoon a stuttering wreck. For example: The very spin of the planet createscentrifugal force which throws matter to the outside, very much like a spindryer in which the clothes spin around a hole in the centre. When the planet wasin its molten form, spinning into existence before it cooled, how could itpossibly remain solid to the core? It is against all logic and laws of force,and if you look at Figure 23 you will see from the drawing of Donati’s Cometfrom 1853 how matter is hurled to the outside to spin around the bright core or‘sun’. The Earth is basically the same. Researchers of the hollow Earth havesuggested that the outer crust goes down some 800 miles and beyond that theplanet is hollow. People live on the other side of the very land that we liveon. If you think that is impossible then ask why people in Australia don’t falloff the Earth even though they are on the opposite side of the surface to thosein the northern hemisphere. The answer is that they are pulled to the land bygravity. So are those who live inside the Earth. The force of gravity pullstowards matter and so those on both sides of the planet’s landmass, inside andoutside, will be pulled by gravity towards the land and neither will ‘fall off’.The centre of the Earth’s gravity is not at the core of the planet, but at about400 miles down… the centre of the outer land mass and so gravity pulls equallyon both sides (see Figure 24).[../Images/00069.jpg]Figure 24: The inner earth as some researchers believe it to be. Hollow in thecentre with an inner central sun and water flowing between the polar openings.Gravity would be the same on both sides of the crust because gravity attracts tomass.The alleged openings at the poles make sense because the power of centrifugalforce in the period of formation would have been far less in those areas. Atabout 70 to 75 degrees north and south latitude, the Earth starts to curve intothe polar openings to the inner Earth, supporters of this theory suggest. It isso gradual that people who claim to have experienced this had no idea they wereentering the inner Earth until they began to see land that did not appear on themaps. These openings are an estimated 1,400 miles across and around them is amagnetic ring. The entrances are covered by clouds most of the time, advocatesclaim, and the airspace is restricted by law. When explorers searching for theNorth or South Pole reach this magnetic ring their compasses point straight downand they believe they are at the pole. They are not. They are at the magneticring which encircles the poles. The light and warmth inside the Earth come froman inner ‘sun’, it is claimed. Marshall B. Gardner, one of the best knownadvocates of a hollow Earth, believed that this ‘sun’ was created from theoriginal central fiery core around which the forming Earth was spinning, verymuch like the picture of Donati’s comet. If the Earth is hollow, so it must bethat the other planets, formed in the same way and subject to the same laws,would be hollow. How many civilisations live within these planets while humansonly look for life on the surface?Some other questions for the solid-to-the-core advocates: Why are icebergs madeof fresh water when the only water available at the poles, according to theconventional view, is sea water? Where does all the vegetation come from that isfound inside these icebergs? Why is it that explorers who have ventured beyondthe magnetic poles have found that the weather gets warmer and the seas becomeice-free? Why do some animals and birds in the north polar region, like themusk-ox, migrate north in the winter? The conventional scientific view cannotanswer these questions, but the hollow Earth view can. There are fresh waterrivers which flow out of the inner Earth and this warm water, carryingvegetation and pollen, freezes, so forming the fresh water icebergs in an areaof apparently only salt water. There are some books which reveal the detailedevidence of the inner Earth in much greater detail than I have space to do hereand I can recommend The Hollow Earth by Dr Raymond Bernard as an excellentsummary of this evidence.15 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941167]One man famously flew into the inner Earth at the North Pole in 1947 to adistance 1,700 miles beyond magnetic north and the South Pole in 1956 to adistance of 2,300 miles beyond magnetic south. He was Rear Admiral Richard E.Byrd, a well-known figure in the United States Navy. He called the land hefound: “that enchanted continent in the sky” and “the land of ever lastingmystery”.16 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941359] In 1947, Byrd and hispassengers broadcast live on the radio as they flew inside the planet and theysaw the ice of the northern regions replaced by ice-free lands and lakes andmountains covered with trees. They described strange animals resembling mammothsand the land they saw does not appear on any map to this day. After the initialpublicity, information about the Byrd expeditions was suppressed and he died in1957, the year after his trip to the Antarctic. Two years later in December1959, Ray Palmer, the editor of Flying Saucers magazine published an issuedetailing Admiral Byrd’s discoveries, but when the truck arrived from theprinter with that edition, all the magazines were missing. Palmer called theprinter, but he was told there was no shipping receipt to prove the shipment hadbeen made and when he asked for the edition to be reprinted he was told theprinting plates had been so badly damaged this was not possible. Palmer believedthat UFOs came not from space, but from the inner Earth and that was part of hisarticle in that ill-fated edition. I think he could have been right and theancient Indian epic, Ramayana, describes Rama as an emissary from Aghartaarriving in a flying vehicle.The legends of inner Earth peoples and blond-haired, blue-eyed master races, canbe found in countless ancient cultures including China, Tibet, Egypt, India,Europe, the Americas, and Scandinavia. William F. Warren in his work, ParadiseFound, Or The Cradle Of The Human Race, suggests that humans originated on atropical continent in the Arctic, a land of sunshine where a race of gods livedfor more than a thousand years without growing old. Warren connects thisnorthern paradise with the ancient Greek concept of Hyperborea. The Eskimos, whomay originate from inner Earth peoples, have legends which tell of a paradiseisland to the north, a beautiful land of perpetual light where there is nodarkness nor extremes of sunlight, a place where people live for thousands ofyears in peace and happiness. You find the same in Irish myth also. It was tothe inner Earth, legends say, that some of the fleeing Lemurians and Atlanteanssheltered at the time of great geological turmoil and flood on the surface.Plato wrote of mysterious passageways in and around the Atlantean continent,“tunnels both broad and narrow, in the interior of the Earth.”17[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941449] He also described the great ruler“who sits at the centre, on the navel of the Earth… the interpreter of religionto all mankind”.18 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941748] The Romanwriter, Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as Pliny, refers to undergroundpeoples who had fled from Atlantis and there are the legends of the inner Earthdwellers called the Troglodytes who, Pliny said, have hidden in their tunnels agreat, ancient treasure.19 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941832] Suchstories abound in every culture.The Nazi flying saucersStories also abound of ‘flying saucer’ craft built by the Nazis before andduring the war under programmes controlled by the Thule and Vril Society. Germanresearcher, Jan van Helsing, and many others, have detailed some of thetechnology which was produced after 1934, including the Vril-1 fighter, Vril-7(see picture section), and the Haunebu 1, 2 and 3.20[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos941916] These and others were knowncollectively by the Allies as the Foo Fighters. Wendelle C. Stevens, a USairforce pilot in the Second World War and now a UFO investigator, says that theFoo Fighters were sometimes grey-green, sometimes red-orange. They approachedhis aircraft as close as five metres and then just stayed there, he said. Theycould not be shaken off or shot down and caused many squadrons to either turnback or land.21 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942062] Helsing includesphotographs of these craft and other researchers support this information. I amalways very wary of photographs of this kind because they can easily be fakedand circulated until they become accepted as fact, but there is a documentaryvideo, UFO – The Secrets Of The Third Reich, and the researcher and lecturer,Vladomir Terziski, also includes a wealth of material on this subject. TheGerman flying saucers, apparently, had many technical problems and limitationswhich were ironed out after the war. In 1938, according to a number ofresearchers into these subjects, a German expedition to the Antarctic, was ledby the aircraft carrier, Schwabenland, and a 600,000 kilometre region ofice-free mountains and lakes were declared Germany territory.22[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942157] It was called Neuschwabenland (NewSwabia) and became a massive Nazi military base. In 1947 there is said to havebeen a strange naval mission to the Antarctic by Admiral E. Byrd, the man whoflew into the inner Earth at both the North and South Poles. He took with him4,000 soldiers and a fully equipped aircraft carrier. After eight weeks and highcasualties, they pulled out, some researchers claim. What happened remains amystery, but Byrd would later say publicly that it was the bitter reality thatin the case of a new war, one had to expect attacks by planes that could flyfrom pole to pole. He added that there was an advanced civilisation inAntarctica, and together with the SS, they used advanced systems of technology.23 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942352]So why didn’t the Nazis win the war? Well firstly, it seems there was conflictbetween the Nazi secret societies and secondly, the ‘flying saucer’ technologywas still far from perfected. But the simple answer to why the Germans did notwin the war is that they were not meant to. The reptilians of the lower fourthdimension were manipulating them, yes, but they were working through the othersides also. They wanted a war and so they manipulated all parties to achieve it.As I document and source at length in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, theNazis were funded by the classic bloodline families who were also funding theAllies ‘opposing’ Hitler. The Rothschilds were at the heart of this, once againworking through their vehicles in England, the United States and Germany.Standard Oil, controlled by the Rockefellers, was, in effect, the same companyas I. G. Farben, Hitler’s chemical giant which operated the concentration campat Auchwitz. I. G. Farben was the heart of the Nazi war machine and it wastechnological knowledge transferred to them by Standard Oil which allowed Hitlerto fight the war. This included the know-how necessary to turn the vast Germancoal reserves into oil. Other oil supplies were provided for Germany by StandardOil through the Brotherhood financial centre and stronghold, Switzerland. ThePresident of Standard Oil, New Jersey (now Exxon), was William Stamps Farish, aclose friend of Hermann Schmitz, the chairman of I. G. Farben. Farish’sgrandson, William Farish III, is one of the inner circle around George Bush andalso entertains the Queen of England and Prince Philip at his home. Farish andthe Queen breed their horses together. Bush’s father, Prescott Bush, thestalwart of the Skull and Bones Society, was one of the funders of Hitler. Thiswas done through a subsidiary company called the United Banking Corporation(UBC) of which Prescott Bush was a director and leading light. The UBC connectedthe W. A. Harriman Company of New York (Brown Brothers, Harriman, after 1933)with the business network of Fritz Thyssen, the German steel entrepreneur andbanker, who funded Hitler from the 1920s. The Harriman operation, like the J. P.Morgan and Rockefeller empires, was bankrolled by the Payseurs and theRothschilds. Meanwhile, the Rothschilds were also in control of Hitler’s I. G.Farben.Among those on the board of Farben’s US subsidiary, American I. G., was PaulWarburg, the Payseur/Rothschild trustee and agent who was sent to the UnitedStates to introduce the Federal Reserve banking scam that came to fruition in1913. His brother, Max Warburg, was Hitler’s banker until he left Germanywithout a problem in 1938 and settled in the United States. Other funders ofHitler included General Electric, which had close financial connections toFranklin Delano Roosevelt, the President who ‘opposed’ Hitler; the Ford MotorCompany under Henry Ford who was awarded Germany’s highest honour conferred onnon-Germans, the Grand Cross of the German Eagle; and International Telephoneand Telegraph (ITT) , which, in collusion with Hitler’s personal banker and SSofficer, Baron Kurt von Schroder, also bankrolled the Nazi war effort.Master-minding this coordinated support was Montagu Norman (Comm 300), thegovernor of the Rothschild-controlled Bank of England. Norman was an associateof Hjalmar Schact, who would become Hitler’s financial advisor and president ofthe German Reichsbank. These two were so close that Schact named one of hisgrandsons after Norman. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Norman releasedsix million pounds worth of Czech gold to Hitler which was deposited in London.Incidentally, the two signatures on the document confirming Schact’s appointmentas president of the Reichsbank on March 17th 1933, were Adolf Hitler and theRothschild frontman, Max Warburg. Most ‘Jewish’ people think that families likethe Rothschilds and the Warburgs, who both claim to be Jewish, are on theirside. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I mentioned earlier, the trailof the gold and money stolen by Swiss banks from German Jews during the war alsoleads back to the Rothschilds.The Rothschilds and their associates the Rockefellers, Harrimans, and Bushs,were also behind the Nazi race purity programme. Of course they were. Hitler’srace purity expert was Dr Ernst Rudin, a psychiatrist at the Kaiser WilhelmInstitute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin. There he occupied an entirefloor with his research and it was all made possible by funds provided by… theRockefellers.24 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942462] It was these samefamilies who funded the eugenics movement which is pledged to remove the lowergenetic blood streams and leave only those of superior stock. Eugenics todayoften goes under the title of ‘population control’. The best known of thepopulation control organisations is Planned Parenthood which began life underanother name at the London offices of the British Eugenics Society. No wonderGeorge Bush has taken every opportunity to pump vast amounts of American andUnited Nations money into that organisation. Bush and Henry Kissinger areadvocates of Thomas Malthus, the Freemason of the Darwin bloodline, who died in1834. Malthus called for the culling of non-white peoples and for those whitepeople of ‘lesser’ stock. Malthus and his economist friend, the Freemason, JohnStuart Mill, said that the Aryan race, the blond-haired, blue-eyed people, wasGod’s gift to the world. The higher stock of the white race had to control the‘ignorant’ dark skinned races, this pair said. Now that is no different from theNazi philosophy or that of the British and American establishment because theyare from the same stream. Why have policies been introduced in Africa, Centraland South America, and Asia, which have caused such disease, death anddestruction? It is part of an ongoing plan. You can read the detailed backgroundto the funding of Hitler, the role of the Rothschilds, and the masterrace-population control programme in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free.Yet more confirmation that the same force controlled all sides in the SecondWorld War came with the British-American Intelligence operation called ProjectPaperclip which sprung the main Nazi leaders, scientists, engineers and mindcontrol experts out of Germany before the allied armies arrived. They weretransported to South America and the United States to continue their work forthe reptilian Agenda. The Nazis who were tried and hanged at the NurembergTrials were merely the pawns paraded before a show trial to placate publicanger. The kings, queens, bishops, and knights of the Nazi regime escaped tocontinue their campaign against humanity via the networks arranged by their‘opposition’, the United Kingdom and the United States. Among the Nazis whoescaped in Project Paperclip was the mass murderer and torturer, Josef Mengele.The CIA was the creation of British Intelligence and particularly its Eliteinner circle known as the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The CIA replacedthe wartime US intelligence organisation, the Office of Strategic Services(OSS), which was born out of the Payseur empire intelligence operation. The OSSwas headed by Bill Donovan, a puppet of the Payseur-Rothschild-Rockefellercircle, and a former classmate of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Donovan’s law tutorat the Brotherhood owned Columbia University was Professor Harland F. Stone, whowould later become US Attorney General. Another of Stone’s proteges was J. EdgarHoover, the 33rd degree Freemason and infamous head of the FBI at the time ofthe Kennedy assassination. Significantly, as I highlight at length in …And TheTruth Shall Set You Free, a number of key operatives in the murder of PresidentKennedy were former OSS agents posted to the British Intelligence headquartersin London during the Second World War. Among them was Clay Shaw, the CIA assetwho is the only man to be tried for his part in the Kennedy assassination, atrial featured in the film, JFK. He was cleared only because the main witnessesagainst him were murdered in the run up to his appearance in court. Shaw was anadvisor to the Satanist and Rothschild clone, Winston Churchill, and, like allthe OSS agents in wartime London, he danced to the tune of people like LordVictor Rothschild, the unofficial string-puller of the British Intelligencenetwork.The first Director of the CIA was Allen Dulles, a Nazi himself, as was hisbrother, John Foster Dulles, who was appointed Secretary of State. The Dulles’are another British aristocratic bloodline. Both Dulles brothers were involvedin Project Paperclip, as was Henry Kissinger,25[../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942691] a ‘German Jew’, who answers not toJudaism, but to Satanism and his fellow reptilians. The Dulles’ were from asouthern slave owning family and were cousins of the Rockefellers. The Dulleslaw firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, handled the US affairs of I. G. Farben andHitler’s major backer, Fritz Thyssen, introduced Allen Dulles to him. JohnFoster Dulles wrote “Heil Hitler” on his letters to German clients and he wassent to Germany to negotiate new loans for the Nazis on behalf of theRothschild-Rockefeller Round Table group. The loans were made to help theGermans pay back their war reparations which the same John Foster Dulles hadhelped to impose as a member of the American delegation at the Versailles PeaceConference in 1919. No wonder, then, that the CIA was created by Nazis, forNazis. Among them was Reinhard Gehlen, Hitler’s SS spymaster for the Russianfront, who was appointed by Allen Dulles to set up the CIA network in Europe.The writer and researcher, Noam Chomsky, says that Gehlen formed a secretCIA-Nazi army which extended its operations to Latin America. It’s a similarstory with the international police network called Interpol. The Nazi mentalitydidn’t lose the war. It was controlling all sides and after the carnage, it wasbusiness, or rather Agenda, as usual. Did Hitler die in the bunker? Of coursenot. Dr Robert Dorion, Director of Forensic Dentistry for the Ministry of theSolicitor General of Quebec in Montreal, has found glaring discrepancies betweenthe photographs of the corpse’s teeth and the thousands of open-mouth shots ofHitler. The pattern of gaps between the teeth is different. Hitler had a rootcanal and a porcelain tooth which the corpse did not, and the lower bridgeworkwas very different.26 [../Text/index_split_033.html#filepos942861]After the war, the Nazi leadership simply exchanged their jackboots and tinhelmets for smart suits and scientist’s overalls and the Agenda continued. Giventhis fact, does anyone still believe that the controlling Nazi-Satanic core ofthe US Government would not deliberately set out to burn children to death atWaco or blow them up at Oklahoma in pursuit of their Agenda for globaldomination? This is the mentality that controls our world and five billionpeople are allowing it to happen. Only if they continue to do so, can thereptile-Aryan-Nazi mentality maintain it’s power over Planet Earth."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_032.html#filepos881869] Quoted by J.

But its basicstructure and Agenda remains very simple.The centre of the operational web is the City of London with interlockingleaderships in places like France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and theUnited States. These are the spiders in the web with the City of London, ‘NewTroy’, the most important. From this centre the Global Agenda and policies areadministered and their ‘branch managers’ introduce those policies in eachcountry. So if it suits the Global Agenda to crash the US dollar, the Mexicanpeso, the South African rand, or the Far East stock-markets, the branch managersin those areas will take the action necessary to do that. The Brotherhood don’tsuffer, indeed quite the opposite, because they know what is coming. The majorBrotherhood banks in the United States, like the Rockefellers’ Chase Manhattan,increased their profits on the Mexican peso in 1991, the year the value of thepeso collapsed, because they sold their peso holdings just before the crash. In1987, the late billionaire financier and Rothschild relative, Jimmy Goldsmith,sold all his holdings just before the world stock-market crash. A coincidence,of course.At the heart of the web, or the top of the pyramid, whichever analogy youchoose, are the reptilians. These operate mostly in the background fromunderground bases and overwhelmingly by possessing the reptilian-humanbloodstreams which resonate most closely to the reptile consciousness of thelower fourth dimension. These reptile full-bloods and reptile-possessed peoplehold the major positions of power in the world or work in the backgroundcontrolling those in the positions of apparent power like prime ministers andpresidents. Having a reptilian or reptilian-controlled human as president mightsound fantastic if you have allowed yourself to have your vision of possibilitysuppressed to the size of a pea, but when you see the evidence put together overthousands of years, it makes perfect sense of the ‘mysteries’ of history. Peopleask me the understandable question of why anyone would want to dedicate theirlives to taking over a planet when they knew they were going to die long beforeit was achieved. Answer: The consciousness controlling that body is only usingit as an overcoat, a space suit, until it wears out. When that happens, itpossesses another one. These same reptilians have been occupying the bodies ofall the main players in the conspiracy going back to ancient times. Theobsession with interbreeding within the Brotherhood bloodstreams comes from theneed to hold the reptilian genetic inheritance and therefore maintain thevibrational connection between the human body on the third dimension and itscontrolling force on the lower fourth. It was to hide this truth that theyarranged for the destruction of ancient historical records, texts, and accountsover the centuries as they ravaged and raped the native societies of the world.The reptilians wanted to destroy all memory and records of their earlier openexistence and control in the past. If they could do that, humanity would have noidea that they were being controlled through physical bodies that look human bya fourth-dimensional force that is not human.[../Images/00072.jpg]Figure 25: The pyramid of power in which all institutions ultimately fuse intothe same tiny Elite. This allows the same Agenda to be orchestrated through allareas of society.The truth of what happened and continues to happen is held under the strictestsecrecy at the highest level of the secret society network and only a relativehandful of people know the story. Each section of the global pyramid is itself asmaller compartmentalised pyramid. These are like watertight compartments on aship or, more appropriately given its covert nature, a submarine. As above, sobelow. For example, the Freemason’s pyramid answers to a common leadership andthen this leadership in turn answers to a higher one. The Illuminati degreesbegin where the Freemasons degrees end so the 33rd degree of the Scottish Riteand tenth degree of the York Rite appear to be as far as anyone can go and formost Masons that’s true. But if someone is considered the right mentality andbloodline by the Brotherhood, they move on to the next level, the Illuminatidegrees or to another of the highly secretive inner-circle groups like the RoundTable which operate above the levels of the official secret societies like theFreemasons and the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta). At their peak, thehierarchies of the secret societies fuse and connect with a common leadershipand at that level they are all the same organisation working to the same Agenda,despite their countless internal quarrels and conflicts.This secret society network places its trusted initiates into the mostinfluential positions in the world of banking, business, politics, the media,the military, medicine, etc, and again at their highest levels, these apparentlyunconnected organisations and institutions fuse into the same pyramid peak andare controlled by the same people. It is like Russian dolls, one doll, or inthis case, pyramid, inside another, until you reach the global pyramid whichencompasses all of them (see Figure 25). The public faces of theseorganisations, and those who control them behind the scenes, might connect intothe network by being a Freemason, a Knight of Malta, an initiate of the Skulland Bones Society, or as a member of a group of secret and semi-secretorganisations called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Councilon Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, and the TrilateralCommission, which I will explain more about in a moment. The point I amstressing here is that while all these groups have different names andapparently different aims, they are all the same organisation controlled in theend by the same leadership.The spiderThe secret societies and groups which form the vast web of interconnectedoperations are an expanded version of the same network which goes back intoantiquity. Some researchers say that the upper hierarchy appears to consist ofthe Council of 3, the Council of 5, the Council of 7, Council of 9, Council of13, Council of 33, the Grand Druid Council, the Committee of 300 (also known asthe ‘Olympians’), and the Committee of 500. Many groups have no name to avoiddetection.1 [../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1011104] I’m sure that there isone, maybe two, people, sitting atop this pyramid, a sort of High Priest andHigh Priestess of the world because, as I will expand on later, the mostimportant hierarchy to which all others are subordinate is the Satanisthierarchy. If you want to control the game, you have to control all sides andthis structure allows that to happen. The Brotherhood control the ‘fors’ and the‘againsts’ in politics, banking, business, the media, and politics. They haveagents in all governments and agents in the other political parties ‘opposing’those governments; they have agents on both sides in wars and politicalconflicts; in the drug-running cartels and in the anti-drug agencies ‘opposing’those cartels; within the organised crime syndicates and the police and securityagencies ‘investigating’ those syndicates; within terrorist groups and theintelligence agencies ‘investigating’ those groups. Just because someone says hestands for freedom and peace does not mean that he does. In fact, if he did hewould not need to say it because it would be obvious. I have a simple rule.Anything that calls itself ‘democratic’ stands for anything but. Look at thenumber of Democratic Fronts around the world which spend their time imposing adictatorship.The Round Table networkOne of the major networks is governed from the centre by the Round Table (seeFigure 26 overleaf). As we have seen, the Round Table has branches all over theworld and in 1920 and 1921 it added the Royal Institute of International Affairs(RIIA) and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) to its web. The RIIA itselfcreated its own offshoots. The Council on Foreign Relations in New Yorkdeveloped its own subordinate network within the United States which connectsthe Babylonian Brotherhood with US government departments, Congress, mediaowners, editors, journalists, the tax-exempt foundations like the RockfellerFoundation, universities, scientists, ambassadors, military leaders,‘historians’, bankers, and business people. Each major country has such anetwork which follows the Agenda dictated from the global centres in the City ofLondon, Germany, France, and Switzerland. I was attacked in my absence once on aCape Town radio station by an ‘astrologer’ who said that the conspiracy I amexposing could not exist because it could not be organised over such a longperiod. As usual he had not read any of my books or done any research whatsoeverbefore dismissing the possibility and if he had he would realise that, becauseof the structure I am describing, it is not only possible to follow the sameAgenda across the generations, it is perfectly straightforward. Why don’t bigcorporations or banks cease to exist when one generation of leadership retiresor dies? Because the next generation takes over. Exactly. So it is with theBrotherhood and its Agenda. Perhaps the astrologer might consult his own birthchart and identify the planetary conjunction which is closing his eyes to theobvious and the planet which impels him, like billions of others, to dismiss andcondemn information they have made no attempt to read, check, or understand.[../Images/00073.jpg]Figure 26: The Round Table network.In May 1954 came the first official meeting of the next organisation in theRound Table web, the Bilderberg Group (Bil), which was named after theBilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where that opening meeting tookplace. Or that’s the official story, anyway. Bil or Bel was also the Sun God ofthe Phoenicians. Bilderberg translates as ‘Bel of the rock’ or ‘Bel of themountain’. The Bilderberg Group was chaired from 1954 to 1976 by Prince Bernhardof the Netherlands, the former Nazi SS officer and German spy working for theNW7 Intelligence department operating within the unspeakable chemical giant, I.G. Farben, which ran the Auchwitz Concentration Camp.2[../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1011217] Pope John Paul II is said by someresearchers to have worked for I. G. Farben, also. It makes sense because theBrotherhood pick the Popes, of course. Prince Bernhard, a German who marriedinto the Dutch Royal Family, just as William of Orange had done, is a reptilianblood relative and great friend of Britain’s Prince Philip. Together theylaunched the World Wildlife Fund, now the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). Thelast thing they were interested in was protecting wildlife as we shall see in alater chapter. In 1968 came the Club of Rome, headed by the Bilderberger andFreemason, Aurelio Peccei (Comm 300), the number two at Fiat to the BlackNobility Bilderberger, Giovanni Agnelli. Peccei once said to his friend, theformer US Secretary of State, Alexander Haig (TC, Knight of Malta), that he feltlike Adam Weishaupt reincarnated.3 [../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1011626]Weishaupt was the man behind the Bavarian Illuminati. The Club of Rome, set upat the Rockefeller family’s private estate at Bellagio in Italy, created theenvironmental movement. The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds have played theenvironmental movement like a violin. The Club of Rome has used the environmentto centralise power and confiscate land. It claims to be campaigning to ‘savethe planet’ when in truth it is just another front for the Agenda intent oncontrolling the world and, what’s more, a front peopled by those who aredemonstrably creating the very environmental problems they say they wish tostop. The same applies to the so-called Club of Budapest which is trying to dowith ‘spirituality’ what the Club of Rome has done with the environment. TheClub of Budapest is headed by Ervin Laszio, an associate of the Club of Rome’s,Aurelio Peccei. Another important Round Table satellite is the TrilateralCommission which was created by the Rockefellers in the United States in 1972and it has a role in the network of coordinating the Agenda between three partsof the world, the United States, Europe and Japan. In …And The Truth Shall SetYou Free, I expose these organisations and their membership at great length, butfor those who have not read that book I’ll give you an idea of the scale oftheir influence on daily life and world affairs. Whenever I mention someone whowas, is, or would later become, a member of these groups, I will use theshorthand of RIIA, CFR, Bil and TC. I cannot at this time tell you much aboutthe modern membership of the Royal Institute of International Affairs because itis so secretive and if anyone can help me with that I’d be much obliged. Some oftheir most important members I do know, however.These interlocking groups have among their number the top people in globalbanking, business, media, military, intelligence agencies, education, andpolitics. A look at some of the people who attended the first Bilderberg meetingin 1954 gives further indication of the sort of people we are talking about. Thechairman was Prince Bernhard, the husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands(Comm 300), who has herself been a regular Bilderberg attendee. The presentQueen, Beatrix, is another Bilderberg promoter. Other Bilderberg chairmen haveincluded Sir Alex Douglas Hume (Lord Home), one of the Elite Scottish bloodlinesand a former British Prime Minister, and another British aristocratic bloodline,Lord Carrington, who became chairman in 1991. More about him in a second. PrinceBernhard was head-hunted to be the Bilderberg chairman by Lord VictorRothschild, the spy, conman of colossal proportions, and one of the majormanipulators of the 20th century. Other attendees of that first meetingincluded: David Rockefeller (CFR,TC); Deak Rusk (CFR, TC, Rhodes Scholar), thehead of the Rockefeller Foundation and Secretary of State under John F. Kennedy;Joseph E. Johnson (CFR), head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace(War!) and US Secretary for the Bilderbergers; Denis Healey (TC, RIIA, Comm 300,Fabian Society), the British Labour Party Minister of Defence from 1964–1970 andChancellor of the Exchequer 1974–1979; and Lord Boothby, who worked with WinstonChurchill on the unification of Europe, later known as the European Union.NATO was a creation of the Brotherhood and is designed to evolve by stealth intoa world army by encompassing more and more countries and by manipulating‘problems’ which give it the opportunities to operate outside its designatedarea. The last six Secretary-generals of NATO alone have all been Bilderbergers,Joseph Luns, Lord Carrington, Manfred Woener, Willy Claes, Javier Solana andGeorge Robertson. The head of the World Bank, the Rothschild partner, JamesWolfensohn, and a stream of his predecessors like Robert Strange McNamara, areBilderbergers. So are the first two heads of the new World Trade Organisation, aBrotherhood creation which imposes heavy fines on countries who seek to protecttheir people from the merciless global financial and trading system. The firsthead of the World Trade Organisation was Peter D. Sutherland of Ireland (Bil,TC, Comm 300), the Director of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT),Commissioner of the European Community (Union), and chairman of Allied IrishBanks and Goldman Sachs. He later became head of British Petroleum (BP).Sutherland is an Elite clone make no mistake and he was replaced at the WTO byan Italian Bilderberger, Renato Ruggerio. Both the World Bank and the WorldTrade Organisation connect with other global financial agencies like theInternational Monetary Fund and the G-7/G-8 group to impose their will andpolicies on developing countries in Africa, South and Central America, and Asia,and to ensure they are controlled by the transnational corporations which answerto the same overall leadership. The Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI)is another scam designed to dramatically increase the ability of thetransnational corporations to destroy a country’s economic base by imposingtheir will on the government and walking away with the profits while avoidingthe tax and business laws the other businesses have to face. The central bankingnetwork connects into the Round Table-Bilderberg operation. A number of heads ofthe Bank of England including Sir Gordon Richardson have been Bilderbergers andthe same applies to the other central banks like the United States FederalReserve, the cartel of private banks controlled from Europe which controls theUS economy. The current head of the ‘Fed’ is Alan Greenspan (CFR, TC, Bil) andhe replaced Paul A.Volker (CFR, TC, Bil). You get the picture. Every few weeksin the United States and Britain, the media speculate on the possible content ofstatements by Greenspan and the Governor of the Bank of England or theBundesbank about the state of their countries’ economies. These statements can,and do, send the stock-markets rising and falling on the basis of what thesepeople say. If they put interest rates up or down it can have a spectaculareffect on the markets and people’s lives. Who do you think controls these peopleand the statements they make? Exactly. A friend of mine who invests heavily inthe US markets began to study the investment patterns of the major corporations,banks, and insurance companies, in the period immediately before BilderbergerGreenspan was due to make his financial statements. On every occasion he foundthat the big players either massively buy or sell stock or bonds of a specifickind in the three days before Greenspan speaks. And the statement made byGreenspan has, on each and every occasion, had a fundamental effect on preciselythe stock or bonds the Brotherhood have bought or sold. If you want to know whatthe stock-markets are going to do, watch the buying and selling patterns of theBrotherhood families and corporations who control the markets. Interlocking with‘gofers’ like Greenspan and major players like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers,are ‘renegade’ financiers such as George Soros (Bil) who simply follow orders.It was Soros who made billions by attacking the British pound in September 1992,costing the people unbelievable amounts of money as the Chancellor of theExchequer tried to defend the currency. Who was that Chancellor? Norman Lamont…Bilderberg Group. Soros did the same to the Swedish currency with the sameoutcome. Who was the Swedish Prime Minister at the time? Carl Bildt… BilderbergGroup. It was the fear of standing alone caused by that Soros raid which turneda majority of Swedish public opinion to favour entry into the European Union,something most Swedes now appear to bitterly regret.The careers of so many politicians have taken off dramatically after theyattended Bilderberg meetings. In the 1970s the career of the BritishConservative Party politician, Margaret Thatcher, soared when she began toattend Bilderberg meetings and her election to Prime Minister was made certainin 1979 by the explosion of scandals and strikes which brought down the LabourGovernment. A year later Ronald Reagan and George Bush were elected to the WhiteHouse and they introduced exactly the same extreme economic policies thatMargaret Thatcher was doing under the name Thatcherism. It wasn’t Thatcherism atall, it was the Agenda unfolding as interest rates took off to levels thatcrippled the Third World and made them ripe for the recolonisation programmethrough financial control. Also, the privatisation mania underThatcher-Reagan-Bush handed over state assets to the Brotherhood transnationalcorporations at knock-down prices. When Thatcher had outlived her usefulness shewas dumped, because everyone is expendable to the cause. In 1991, a relativelyunknown Governor for Arkansas called Bill Clinton was invited by DavidRockefeller to the Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. A year later thisman of British (Black Nobility) royal blood was President of the United States.In 1993, a British Labour Party Home Affairs spokesman called Tony Blair wasinvited to the Bilderberg meeting at Vouliagment, Greece, and a year later afterthe sudden and unexpected death of the Labour leader, John Smith, it was Blairwho took over. From the moment that happened, a series of scandals and conflictsdestroyed the credibility of the ruling Conservative Government of John Majormaking it certain that Blair would become Prime Minister in a landslide victoryin 1997. When I was on a speaking tour of Australia in early 1997, I predictedthat not only would Blair be elected as Prime Minister, the election would takeplace on May 1st because, going back to ancient times, that was a very importantday to the Babylonian Brotherhood. Examples of this are the May Day fertilityrituals and the May 1st celebrations in the Brotherhood-created Soviet Union.The Bavarian Illuminati was officially formed on May 1st 1776. Tony Blair wassuch an important frontman for the Brotherhood that I just knew they would bringhim to power on May 1st. In Britain they do not have fixed term governments, thePrime Minister can call the election any time within five years of coming topower and so he is the one who officially announces the date. What did JohnMajor do? Under instruction from the Tribe, he called the 1997 General Electionfor May 1st and Tony Blair, a big-time Brotherhood chosen one, was elected PrimeMinister on that day. Apparently the Blairs’ latest child was conceived on thesolar eclipse over England on August 11th 1999 and was due to be born sometimein early May 2000. From the moment he came to power, Blair and his BilderbergerChancellor, Gordon Brown, began to introduce the Brotherhood Agenda for theMillennium years in Britain and Europe. This included conceding the government’spower to set interest rates to the Bank of England, a move which happened withindays of the election. The economic policies followed by Bilderberger Brown wereno different in fundamentals to those of the previous Conservative Chancellor,Kenneth Clarke, whom Brown replaced. This is not surprising because Clarke isalso a Bilderberger and attended the meeting with Tony Blair in Greece and againat Turnberry, Scotland, in May 1998. Brotherhood Labour yes-man replacesBrotherhood Conservative yes-man as the official head of the nation’s financesand the only thing that changes is the name on the door. Britain, like Americaand virtually every other country in the world, is a one-party-state while thepublic go on thinking they are free because they have the right to put a crosson a piece of paper every five years and choose the next Brotherhood puppet torun their country. In the United States, staggeringly, they vote electronicallyand this makes it so easy to rig.Tony Blair became an immediate bosom-buddy of Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil) andthey speak with one (Brotherhood) voice. Blair’s ‘minder’ in the LabourGovernment has been Peter Mandelson (Bil, RIIA), nicknamed the Prince ofDarkness. He is one of the most important Brotherhood link-men within theBritish Labour Party and continues to be so despite his resignation from thecabinet over a financial scandal. Incidentally it was when Peter Mandelson tookcharge of the Labour Party’s image-making in the 1980s that they changed theirparty symbol from the red flag to the classic Brotherhood symbol over the ages…the red rose. Chancellor Kohl of Germany is a Bilderberger and so were hispredecessors, Brandt and Schmidt. Many prime ministers and leading politiciansin the Netherlands, including Ruud Lubbers, are Bilderbergers and it’s the samethroughout Europe with people such as Carl Bildt and the assassinated Olof Palme(Sweden), Uffe Ellemann-Jenson and Ritt Bjergegaard (Denmark). Jacques Santer,former head of the European Commission, is a Bilderberger. He was the mostimportant public voice in the European Union and he ran his centraliseddictatorship with the stunning arrogance that Brotherhood initiates find so easyto manifest. His successor follows the same pattern of Brotherhood clone.European royalty is represented at Bilderberg meetings by the Dutch, Swedish,Spanish and British royal families, or in truth: family. Lord Mountbatten,Prince Philip, and Prince Charles have attended Bilderberg meetings.The “peace-keepers”When Brotherhood organisations use a word in their name they invariably mean theopposite. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace manipulates war and‘Democratic Fronts’ all over the world introduce dictatorships. It can be thesame with ‘peace-keepers’ and ‘peace negotiators’. Henry Kissinger goes aroundthe world talking about “peace” and yet when he leaves a country all hell oftenbreaks out. It’s not that he’s a bad negotiator, he’s just doing his job for theTribe. His company, Kissinger Associates (founding director Lord Carrington(RIIA, Bil, TC), was heavily involved in starting the Bosnian war which hasmoved the world closer to a global army under NATO control. This is a constanttheme. Start the war and then negotiate the ‘peace’ to suit your Agenda. At thestart of the Bosnian conflict, the status quo was the United NationsPeacekeeping Force. But it was exposed, by design, to be ineffective and withhorrific pictures pouring from the television screens every night, the globalcry was: “Something must be done, this can’t go on, what are they going to doabout it.” That ‘something’ offered by the very people who had engineered thewar, was a 60,000-strong NATO world army, the biggest multinational forceassembled since the Second World War. It is in these circumstances that theRound Table network can be used to ensure the right appointments. The firstpeace negotiator appointed by the European Union in Bosnia was, yes, yes, LordCarrington, chairman of the Bilderberg Group, President of the Royal Instituteof International Affairs, Trilateral Commission member, and one of the Committeeof 300. He was replaced by Lord David Owen (Bil, TC) and Carl Bildt (Bil), theformer Swedish Prime Minister. The United Nations appointed negotiators wereCyrus Vance (Bil, CFR, TC) and the Norwegian, Thorvald Stoltenberg (Bil, TC).When their negotiations came to nothing, along came an ‘independent’ negotiator,Jimmy Carter, the first Trilateral Commission President of the United States,and a CFR member. The cry of “Do something” got even louder as the horrors inBosnia continued unchecked and then came Richard Holbrooke (CFR, TC, Bil), thepeace envoy of Bill Clinton, who negotiated the Dayton Agreement whichintroduced the NATO world army in Bosnia. Holbrooke answered to the thenSecretary of State, Warren Christopher (CFR, TC), and the Defence Secretary,William Perry (Bil). They reported to the President, Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil)who followed the orders of David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger, leading lightsin the CFR, TC, Bil, and RIIA. The first head of the NATO world army in Bosniawas Admiral Leighton Smith (CFR) and the civilian end of the operation wascontrolled by Carl Bildt (Bil). Oh yes, and the American ambassador in theformer Yugoslavia was Warren Zimmerman (CFR). What’s more, the financier, GeorgeSoros (Bil), just happened to have a series of tax-exempt ‘foundations’throughout the former Yugoslavia before and during the war. Just a coincidence,nothing to worry about. This is only one example of the techniques andorganisations used to change the world by making wars and deciding what happensas a result of them. Problem-reaction-solution. There are endless otherexamples, including Bosnia, stage two, the Kosovo conflict. Some of the namesbehind the Bilderberg Group and the wider network are very familiar, theRothschilds, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, and Lord Carrington. I havewritten much about the Rothschilds, but it is important to know about the otherthree as well. They are not the very top of the pyramid people, but they areright up there at the operational level:• David Rockefeller (CFR, TC, Bil, RIIA, Comm 300)The Rockefellers (previous name Rockenfelder) became one of the most powerfulfamilies in the United States with the help of Rothschild money and, no doubt,through other sources, too. The manipulation of the United States and the widerworld abounds with the name Rockefeller, be it J. D. Rockefeller, NelsonRockefeller, Winthrop Rockefeller, Laurance Rockefeller, or the most notoriousof them in the second half of the 20th century, David Rockefeller. If theRockefeller family and its networks and interconnecting bloodlines had neverexisted, the United States would be a very different place today: a land withfar greater freedom than it currently enjoys, as would the world in general.David Rockefeller, the long-time head of the Chase Manhattan Bank and stillunofficially in charge, was secretary of the Council on Foreign Relations StudyGroup which created the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after theSecond World War. Marshall Plan funds were used to promote the European Unionand to undermine the authority of the nation states. The man appointed to headthe Marshall Plan in Europe was… Averell Harriman (Comm 300, Skull and BonesSociety) who based himself at the Rothschild’s Paris mansion. David Rockefellerwas chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1946-53 and created theTrilateral Commission under the leadership of Henry Kissinger (CFR, TC, Bil,RIIA, Comm 300) and Zbigniew Brzezinski (CFR, TC, Bil). Brzezinski was aprofessor at the Brotherhood-founded Columbia University and authored the book,Between Two Ages: America’s Role In The Technotronic Era, which mirrored theBrotherhood vision for the world. He was National Security Advisor to JimmyCarter, the man David Rockefeller selected in 1976 to become the firstTrilateral Commission President of the United States. David Rockefeller is theman behind all the presidents because he controls the money, media, andpolitics, to ensure that both presidential candidates answer to him. That wastrue of George Bush and Bill Clinton in 1992 and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton in1996. If you control the money, the media, and the party machines, you can putanyone you like in the White House and you can get rid of them while they arestill in office if that suits your agenda and timescale. This is why those whotruly represent the interests of the people never reach the upper levels ofpolitics. But it is not just in the United States that this is so. DavidRockefeller has been the banker and puppet master of Russia and the SovietUnion, schooling and dictating to people like Mikhail Gorbachev and BorisYeltsin. Gorbachev, a reptilian shape-shifter, was used by Rockefeller andKissinger to bring down the Soviet Union to allow those countries to begin theprocess of integration into the European Union and NATO. Yeltsin was speaking atTrilateral Commission events before he became President of Russia. You find thehand of David Rockefeller everywhere, for instance, symbolically up the backsideof the glove puppet called Maurice Strong (Bil, Comm 300), the Canadian oilmillionaire or billionaire, who has massively manipulated the environmentalmovement as the first Director of the United Nations Environment Agency and thetop man at the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil. Wherever David Rockefeller goes thestench of corruption, manipulation, and genocide, follows. Which reminds me ofsomeone else…• Henry Kissinger (CFR,TC,Bil, RIIA,Comm 300)Henry Kissinger became world famous after 1968 as the Secretary of State andNational Security Advisor to President Richard Nixon, the only man in US historyto hold both posts at the same time. But Kissinger’s enormous service to theBabylonian Brotherhood goes back a long way before then and continues to thepresent day. He was born in Germany in 1923 and grew up a Jew under AdolfHitler. But if Kissinger really is a ‘Jew’, why was he one of those involved inProject Paperclip, the Anglo-American Intelligence operation which allowed Nazigenetic and mind experimenters and torturers like Josef Mengele to escape fromGermany at the end of the war to continue their work in the United States andSouth America? Because he could not give a shit about Jewish people, that’s why.They are just cattle to him like every other race, except his own, thereptilians. Kissinger is a Satanist, mass murderer, mind control expert, andchild killer. He arrived in the United States on September 5th 1938 and laterbecame a naturalised American citizen. In 1972 the Polish KGB agent, MichaelGoleniewski, told the British Government that KGB documents he saw prior to hisdefection in 1959 included the name Henry Kissinger as a Soviet Union asset.According to Goleniewski, Kissinger was recruited by the KGB into an espionagecell called ODRA and was given the code name BOR or Colonel BOR. He built hispower-base and ‘reputation’ at Harvard and he was on his way. As I reveal indetail in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, Kissinger has been the man behindall the presidents since Nixon, even though he has not been involved officially.It was he who arranged for the Watergate scandal which removed Nixon and broughtin Gerald Ford (CFR, Bil) as President and Nelson Rockefeller, Kissinger’s cronyand mentor, as vice-president. It was Nelson Rockefeller who advised Nixon toappoint Kissinger in the first place. The Watergate scandal was exposed byjournalists Woodwood and Bernstein of the Washington Post, a paper owned byKissinger’s friend, Katherine Graham (CFR, TC, Bil). I was approached by ascientist working for the Brotherhood against his will, who was ordered to ameeting at the White House during the Bush administration (1988–92). He wasastonished to find Kissinger in the Oval Office dictating events while Bush satthere and nodded. Kissinger had no official role in the Bush administration tothe knowledge of the American public and yet there he was calling the shots.Kissinger’s ‘shuttle diplomacy’ consisted, and consists, of misrepresenting eachside to the other, so sparking war after war. In 1973, Kissinger was given theNobel Peace Prize for stopping the Yom Kippur War which he had actually started.When Kissinger and Carrington come into your country, its time to go on holiday,because all hell normally follows the moment they leave. Ask the people ofBurundi and Rwanda…When George Bush became President in 1988, he appointed two executives of theKissinger Associates to his administration. Brent Scowcroft, the head of theWashington office, became Director of the National Security Council, andLawrence Eagleburger, the President of Kissinger Associates, becameUnder-secretary at the State Department. As I’ve said, Kissinger Associates wasbehind the war in Bosnia and the first ‘peace’ negotiator appointed by theEuropean Union was Lord Carrington, a founding director of Kissinger Associates.This company was also instrumental in the Gulf War, arranging loans for Iraqthrough the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) as early as 1984 to allow SaddamHussein to finance arms purchases through a little known subsidiary of Fiat, theItalian car giant owned by Giovanni Agnelli, the Black Nobility Bilderberger.Charles Barletta, a former Justice Department investigator, was quoted aboutthis in the Spotlight newspaper in Washington on November 9th 1992. The reportsaid:“Barletta added that federal probers had collected dozens of such incriminatingcase histories about the Kissinger firm. But Henry Kissinger seems to possess aspecial kind of immunity. I’m not sure how he does it, but Kissinger wields asmuch power over the Washington national security bureaucracy now as in the dayswhen he was the Nixon administration’s foreign policy czar. He gets the payoff;others get the blame. Kissinger will remain unscathed until Congress finds thecourage to convene a full-dress investigation into this Teflon power broker.”Kissinger operates in the highest levels of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations,and the Club of Rome, and he is a member of the Grand Alpine Freemasonry Lodgein Switzerland, which controlled the notorious Italian terrorist lodge known asP2. The world will not be safe while this man is on the streets. Another of his‘specialities’ is genocide in the Third World to dramatically reduce the numberof non-white faces and to cull those members of the white races considered thelower stock. This programme is being introduced by manipulating famine, disease(including those created in laboratories), war, sterilisation and ‘populationcontrol’. See …And The Truth Shall Set You Free.• Lord Carrington (RIIA, TC, Bil, Comm 300)Peter Rupert Carrington comes from a banking family and is an extremely closeassociate of Kissinger. These are the Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum of globalmanipulation. Carrington was on the board of Hambros Bank (Comm 300 designate)which was connected to the Michel Sindona-P2 Freemasonry scandal in Italy. TheElite P2 Freemasonry Lodge controlled by the Mussolini fascist, Lucio Gelli, wasthe force behind the Red Brigades terrorists in the 1970s who planted thedevastating bomb at Bologna railway station and murdered the leading politician,Aldo Morro, after Morro had rejected Henry Kissinger’s order to change hispolicies. P2 and the Hambros-Carrington-connected Michel Sindona were alsoinvolved in the control of the Vatican Bank. Another casualty was the Italian P2Freemason and banker, Roberto Calvi, who was hanged under Blackfriars Bridgenear the City of London’s Square Mile in 1982 after the scandal became public.Carrington’s other business interests have included some familiar names, RioTinto Zinc, Barclays Bank, Cadbury Schweppes, Amalgamated Metal, British Metal,Christies the auctioneers, and the chairmanship of the Australian New ZealandBank. In his book, The English Rothschilds, Richard Davis reports that LionelRothschild was a frequent visitor to the Carrington’s home in Whitehall. The twofamilies are related by the marriage of the fifth Earl Rosebery to HannahRothschild, daughter of Meyer, in 1878. During the ceremony she was ‘given away’as they say by Prime Minister Disraeli. Carrington, then, is of theRothschild-British aristocratic reptilian bloodline. He has the perfectbackground and attitudes for a Brotherhood manipulator and he has been appointedto perform many tasks for them. He was the British Foreign Secretary who ensuredthat power in the former Rhodesia was transferred from the white minoritygovernment of Ian Smith to the black dictator, Robert Mugabe, and things havegot worse, not better, for the people, exactly as planned. It was Carrington whoresigned as Foreign Secretary because of the ‘mistakes’ he made which led to theFalklands War in 1982. You would have thought that he would have been kept wellaway from things military after that, but no, from 1984 to 1988, he was theSecretary-general of NATO and in 1991 he became the chairman of the BilderbergGroup. While in that post, he was appointed to be the first ‘peace’ negotiatorin Bosnia.Control of the mediaThe names Rothschild, Rockefeller, Kissinger and Carrington appear on the boardsand ‘advisory’ boards of global media corporations and that’s no surprise. Tocontrol humanity through the mind and emotions you simply have to control themedia. Without that it’s impossible. This is made so much easier because theoverwhelming majority of journalists in the world, including the so-called ‘bignames’ in each country, are either agents for the Brotherhood (the smallminority) or they don’t know their arse from their elbow when it comes tounderstanding what is going on in the world. I’ve been a journalist and so Ihave seen both sides and what is termed the communications industry is reallythe blind (journalists) leading the blind (their readers and viewers). Myexperience as a journalist, and as the target of journalists, has shown me veryclearly how remarkably few brain cells you need to do the job. Every day ontelevision stations all over the world, journalists and correspondents givetheir viewers the official version of the event they are reporting. “White Housesources say this…, the Prime Minister says that…, the FBI say the other… ” Inall my time in journalism I cannot recall a single conversation in a newsroomthat didn’t reflect the official version of life and the world. Most journalistsare not manipulating, they are simply stunningly uninformed and often incrediblyarrogant. They believe that if anything of magnitude was going on they wouldknow about it because they are ‘journalists’. In truth they are the last toknow. Arrogance and naïveté, the mental combination that produces so manyjournalists, is a telling and highly destructive combination. Add a padlockedmind and you’ve got the job. One BBC interviewer said to me in all seriousnessthat we should be no more concerned about the membership of the Freemasons thanwe should the membership of the local squash club. I’m not kidding. I have givenmany journalists the story of what is going on and they have either dismissed itwithout even looking at the evidence or they have ridiculed the informationwithout looking at the evidence. I remember meeting a guy, I think his name wasTaylor or something, in Los Angeles in early 1997. He worked for The Observernewspaper in London. I told him about the paedophile activities of George Bushand his drug running operation. I offered to put him in touch with some of thosewho had been abused by Bush. What did this ‘journalist’ do? He went away andwrote an article making personal attacks on me, including the fact that my eyesappeared bloodshot. Not surprising after a non-stop speaking tour of Australia,New Zealand and the United States over a period of two months, but how cananyone write about the state of someone’s eyes when they are being offered, ashe put it himself, the “Story of the century”? Because he’s a journalist, that’swhy. I offered to put the British Sunday People in contact with similar sources,but they didn’t want to know. As the old saying goes: “You cannot bribe or twistthe great British journalist, but seeing what they will do unbribed, there’s noreason to.” Of course there are journalists who are exceptions, and honourableones, but they are so, so rare and ask them what happens when they try to writethe story as it really is.Journalists dance to the official tune and become the copy typists and towncriers for the official version of life. They are the ‘gofers’ for those higherup the media pyramid. At the top are bankers who provide the funds to buy themedia groups. These bankers also control the major industries and businessnetworks and the newspaper, television, and radio operations cannot survivewithout the advertising revenue from these people. The threat to stopadvertising has led to many an exposé of the truth ending up in the bin. Belowthe bankers and industrialists come the media ‘barons’, the Murdochs, Blacks,O’Reillys, and Packers. They toe the line of the funders and advertisers andthey appoint their editors to make sure that the same policy appears in thepapers and broadcast media day after day. The editor appoints the journalistsand they have to follow the same line the editor has been told to follow. Thejournalist answers to the editor, the editor answers to the proprietor, and theproprietor answers to the banks and the corporations – the Brotherhood. This iswhat we call ‘news’. We are led to believe that the great media egos likeMurdoch, Packer, and Ted Turner don’t like each other. Maybe that’s true andmaybe its a smokescreen, it doesn’t really matter. Whichever of them heads anorganisation, the same policy prevails, so the Brotherhood could not care lesswhich of their puppets owns a newspaper because their policy will be followedwhatever. These ‘barons’ are not in control. They are frontmen, that’s all. Lookat Ted Turner, the Council on Foreign Relations member who was supposed to betaking on the system with his Cable News Network (CNN). He sold out to TimeWarner, one of the greatest Brotherhood operations on the planet, and CNN poundsout the official line hour after hour, day after day. When someone genuinelywants to start a television station or newspaper to tell the truth, they can’tget advertising or funding or they have their share price undermined via theunimaginable amounts of money the Brotherhood banks, corporations, and insurancecompanies move around every day. This opens up such media operations to ahostile takeover. The three television networks in the United States, CBS, ABC,and NBC are controlled by members of the Round Table network and so are theWashington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and along, long list of others. The same goes for country after country.Two of the lesser known groups which make the point about control of the mediaare Hollinger Inc. and ‘Independent’ Newspapers. Hollinger owns 68% ofnewspapers in Canada and more than 250 papers and magazines worldwide, includingmajor US papers, The Jerusalem Post, and Telegraph Newspapers in London.Hollinger is a front for British Intelligence. During the last world war, anElite section of British Intelligence called the Special Operations Executiveformed a front organisation called War Supplies Ltd under the leadership of twoBritish agents, George Montagu Black and Edward Plunkett Taylor. It was Taylorwho later wrote the banking laws for the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. Afterthe war this British Intelligence company continued under the name of the ArgusCorporation and more recently it changed its name again to Hollinger. Today itis headed by Conrad Black, the son of the British spy, George Montagu Black, whoset it up in the first place. Conrad Black is a member of the inner sanctum ofthe Bilderberg Group. His father was close to the Bronfman gangster family who,like the Kennedys, made a fortune from running illegal booze during theprohibition the Brotherhood themselves had introduced. The Bronfmans today ownthe liquor giant, Seagrams, as well as a substantial drug running operation. Onthe ‘advisory’ board of Hollinger are Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington, andEdmund de Rothschild! Independent Newspapers is owned by the Irish billionaireand former rugby player, Tony O’Reilly. It includes newspapers in Ireland,Britain, France, Portugal, Mexico, South Africa, and New Zealand. The SouthAfrican President, Nelson Mandela, spent Christmas 1993 at O’Reilly’s holidayhome at Nassau in the Bahamas and soon afterwards the Irishman bought the Argusgroup, South Africa’s biggest newspaper chain.4[../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1011789] This is now a mouthpiece forMandela’s African National Congress (ANC). Since 1994, O’Reilly has bought 60%of the Argus Group, 43% of Newspaper Publishing in Britain, 55% of AustralianProvincial Newspapers, 25% of Irish Press Newspapers, and 44% of Wilson andHorton the largest newspaper group in New Zealand.5[../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1011956] He also has extensive interests incable television in Ireland, and radio and television in Australia and NewZealand. His acquisitions will go on and money will be no object because for allhis self-promotion he is just a puppet.

The Agenda is for the completetakeover of the planet by the reptilians without anyone realising that it haseven happened. They are well on their way to achieving this unless people wakeup. The basic structure is designed around a world government which would takeall the major decisions in the world (see Figure 27). This would control a worldcentral bank, currency (electronic, no cash), and army. All this would beunderpinned by a microchipped population linked to a global computer. Under thisstructure would come three superstates – the European Union, the American Union,and the Pacific Union (Asia, Far East, Australia). There could be a fourth, too,the African Union. This edifice of power would dictate to the current nationstates which are planned to be broken up into regions to dismantle any unifiedresponse to the structure I’ve described. It would, quite simply, be a globalfascist dictatorship and we are so close to this unless there is a revolution ofthinking among the mass of humanity. The network I have summarised in thischapter allows for this Agenda to unfold because there are Brotherhood agentsworking within all the political and economic groups needed to make it happen.The more global problems that can be created, the more pressure there will befor global solutions – the centralised control. The second tier, the ‘unions’ ofsuperstates, is well on the way.[../Images/00075.jpg]Figure 27: The structure the Babylonian Brotherhood is seeking to introduceearly in the new Millennium.The Superstate ‘Unions’The European Union with its central bank and single currency has been evolvedfrom a free trade area called the European Economic Community or Common Market.There was no mention of the superstate when we joined, but that was always theAgenda and it has been achieved by the stepping stones approach: moving towardsthe goal step by step with very few realising where these steps are heading. HadAdolf Hitler won the war he had an economic design for Europe he called it theEuropaische Wirtscraft = gemeinschaft. This translates as… the European EconomicCommunity! Hitler lost the war, at least on the surface, but we got the samepolicy anyway because it was part of the Agenda. If I summarise how the EuropeanUnion has been engineered and the people and organisations behind it, you willsee how the hidden hand operates and be more aware of the tactics being employedto do exactly the same in the Americas, the Pacific region, and Africa. A UnitedStates of Europe under centralised control was the aim of the Knights Templarway back in the 12th and 13th centuries and under their different names andincarnations this same force has achieved that target via the Freemasons, theBilderberg Group, and others. The Bilderberg Group is particularly important,however, in the creation of the present superstate. The men behind the formationof the European Economic Community on behalf of the Brotherhood were Jean Monnet(Comm 300), Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi (Comm 300) from Austria, andJoseph Retinger (Comm 300), a Polish ‘socialist’ who helped Prince Bernhard tocreate the Bilderberg Group. Monnet, the son of a French brandy merchant, wentto Canada in 1910 and there connected with the Hudson Bay Company, an old BlackNobility operation, and the Lazard Brothers Bank. He became a confidant topresidents and prime ministers, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and hisinfluential friends gave him a very lucrative contract to ship materials fromCanada to France during the First World War. When the war ended he was appointedto the Allied Supreme Economic Council and became an advisor to the group aroundLord Milner (Round Table, RIIA, Comm 300) and Colonel Mandel House (Round Table,CFR, Comm 300) which was preparing the Treaty of Versailles and creating theLeague of Nations. Monnet was appointed the Deputy Secretary General of theLeague of Nations and later vice-president of a company called Transamericawhich was owned by the drug-money-laundering Bank of America. Monnet wasperfectly placed to be the puppet through which other powers could manipulateinto being the European Economic Community. Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergiwrote a book in 1923 calling for a United States of Europe. He was named afterRichard Wagner, of whom Hitler had said that to understand Nazi Germany one hadto understand Wagner. A close friend of the Count’s father was Theodore Herzl,the founder of Zionism (Sionism – the Sun cult). The Count’s book was called PanEuropa and he went on to form the Pan European Union with branches right acrossthe continent, supported by leading politicians and the Anglo-AmericaEstablishment, including Colonel House and Herbert Hoover. The Count said in hisautobiography:“At the beginning of 1924, we received a call from Baron Louis de Rothschild;one of his friends, Max Warburg (Hitler’s banker) from Hamburg, had read my bookand wanted to get to know us. To my great surprise (sure!), Warburgspontaneously (sure!) offered us 60,000 gold marks to tide the movement over forits first three years… Max Warburg, who was one of the most distinguished andwisest men that I ever came into contact with, had a principle of financingthese movements. He remained sincerely interested in Pan-Europe for his entirelife. Max Warburg arranged his 1925 trip to the United States to introduce me toPaul Warburg and Bernard Baruch.”10[../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1012461]The European Community, now Union, is another creation of the Brotherhood withall the old familiar names involved. Winston Churchill (Comm 300) was asupporter of the European superstate and he wrote an article in 1930 for theAmerican publication The Saturday Evening Post, called “The United States ofEurope”. A few years later he would play his part in advancing the war which ledto the creation of that very structure. Count Coudenhove-Kalergi was givenenthusiastic backing from people like John Foster Dulles, Nicholas MurrayButler, the President of Columbia University and the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace (‘War’), and Dr Stephen Duggan, the founder and firstPresident of the Institute of Education which was 100% controlled by the Councilon Foreign Relations. The United States Congress passed seven resolutions on thepolitical union of Europe and one of them stated: “The creation of a UnitedEurope must be regarded as an essential step towards the creation of a UnitedWorld” (world government). Jean Monnet also headed the Committee for the UnitedStates of Europe which had the same goal. Since the creation of the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC) it has been evolved as planned, by the stepping stonesmethod, to become the centralised fascist state it was always designed to be.Two admirers of Monnet are Merry and Serge Bromberger, and they set out the planin their book, Jean Monnet And The United States Of Europe:“Gradually, it was thought, the supranational authorities, supervised by theEuropean Council of Ministers at Brussels and the Assembly in Strasbourg, wouldadminister all the activities of the continent. A day would come whengovernments would be forced to admit that an integrated Europe was anaccomplished fact, without their having a say in the establishment of itsunderlying principles. All they would have to do was to merge all theseautonomous institutions into a single federal administration and then proclaim aUnited States of Europe.”11 [../Text/index_split_035.html#filepos1012682]That is where we are now. Again you have the structure of the core few at thecentre dictating the overall plan and the interlocking networks in each countrymanipulating their people and Parliament to follow that overall Agenda.The twoPrime Ministers of Britain before, during, and after our entry into the EuropeanCommunity were Labour’s Harold Wilson (Bil) and the Conservative Edward Heath(Bil, TC). They were both close associates of Lord Victor Rothschild and Heathmade Rothschild head of his ‘policy unit’ during his four years as PrimeMinister between 1970 and 1974. It was in this period, in 1972, that Heathsigned the Treaty of Rome which ensnared the United Kingdom into theBrotherhood’s European spider’s web. Sitting beside Heath at the signingceremony was his Foreign Secretary, Alec Douglas Hume (Lord Home), a chairman ofthe Bilderberg Group and a member of an ancient Scottish bloodline. The wholething was manipulation on a vast scale. The ‘opposition’ Labour Party when wewent into Europe under Harold Wilson (Bil) included in its leadership, RoyJenkins (Bil, TC, RIIA), who would go on to become the President of the EuropeanCommission, James Callaghan (Bil, RIIA), and Denis Healey (Bil, TC, Comm 300),chairman of the International Monetary Fund Interim Committee and member of thecouncil of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Healey was at the firstBilderberg meeting in 1954 and attended more of their gatherings than any otherBritish politician in his period in active politics. Good Old Denis, the man ofthe people? Excuse me. In this same period the leaders of Britain’s third party,the Liberals (now Liberal Democrats) were Jo Grimond (Bil) and Jeremy Thorpe,author of the book, Europe: The Case For Going In. I wonder when they were inthe highest political positions in the land, if Wilson, Heath, Jenkins, andHealey, ever got together and pondered on the remarkable twist of destiny whichled four people, who attended Oxford University in the same period, to becomethe leading political names of 1960s and 1970s, just as the United Kingdom wascommitting itself to membership of the European Community. Wilson (JesusCollege, University College), Jenkins (Balliol), Heath (Balliol), Healey(Balliol), Grimond (Balliol), and Thorpe (Trinity College) are such aninspirational example of what can happen when you have an Oxford education. Thefact that Oxford has always been a major Brotherhood centre and, with Cambridge,is a key recruiting ground for manipulators of the next generation, is purelycoincidental, of course.Heath, a shape-shifting reptilian, was manipulating Britain toward membership ofthe Community right through the 1960s and he was agreeing to the political unionof Britain in Europe as early as April 1962 when he was Lord Privy Seal. Beforetaking Britain into Europe, Heath attended a meeting in Paris in October 1972 tonegotiate the conditions with the French President Georges Pompidou (Bil), aformer employee of Guy Rothschild. Douglas Hurd was the British ForeignSecretary who signed the fascist Maastricht Treaty in February 1992 which turnedthe European Community into the European Union, the superstate. Hurd was aprivate secretary to Ted Heath between 1968 and 1970 and his political secretaryfrom 1970 to 1974 when Heath was Prime Minister and signing Britain into Europe.Hurd was also Minister of State to Lord Carrington in the run up to theFalklands War and it was Hurd who recommended an ‘honorary’ knighthood for HenryKissinger. Since that time influential and apparently opposing political figureslike the Conservatives Ted Heath (Bil, TC), Kenneth Clarke (Bil), Geoffrey(Lord) Howe (Bil, Comm 300), the Labour Party’s Tony Blair (Bil), Gordon Brown(Bil, TC), and the Liberal Democrat leaders, David Steel (Bil, TC) and PaddyAshdown (Bil), have pressed and argued for further and further erosion ofBritish decision making and the swamping of freedom by the centralised,bureaucratic European Union. Blair has blatantly filled his ministerial teamnegotiating with the European Union with people who want the UK to join thesingle bank and currency. Among them, before his resignation in a financialscandal, was our friend Peter Mandelson, the man members of Parliament havedubbed: “the Prince of Darkness”. At the time of writing, the three majorBritish political parties are headed by Tony Blair (Bil), William Haig (Bil),and Paddy Ashdown (Bil).We are being conned and the Brotherhood initiates at the top in the banks andcorporations have been activated to frighten the people into believing therewill be an economic collapse if a country does not join the single bank andcurrency. What nonsense. Norway refused to join the European Union and has hadgreat economic prosperity, not least through its exports to the European Unioncountries! What I have described in Europe is planned for the Americas, thePacific region, and Africa. The American Union is designed to evolve from NAFTA,the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Pacific Union from APEC, AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation, the ‘free-trade area’ formed in 1994 after muchcampaigning by the Rhodes Scholar and former Australian Prime Minister, BobHawke. The Organisation of African Unity and the African Economic Communitybecame the African Union in 2001. NAFTA was negotiated between George Bush(CFR,TC, Skull and Bones), the paedophile President of the United States, andBrian Mulroney, a rapist of mind controlled women, who was Prime Minister ofCanada. I’ll expand on their activities in a later chapter. Bush said when hesigned the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico on August 12th 1992 thathe wanted to see NAFTA stretch from the tip of North America to the tip of SouthAmerica. His ‘opponent’, Bill Clinton, said at a gathering of leaders fromthroughout the Americas on December 10th 1994:“History has given the people of the Americas the chance to build a community ofnations, committed to liberty and the promise of prosperity… early in the nextcentury (I want to see)… a huge free trade zone from Alaska to Argentina.”Other elements of the Agenda include the microchipping of the global population;the complete control of energy supplies, the destruction of alternative forms ofhealing that expose established medicine as a fraud; and global marshal law. Iwill write more about this towards the end of the book.

In the ancientmystery schools, drugs were widely employed to stimulate other states ofconsciousness and to manipulate thought and perception.Opium, from which comes heroin, is the oldest narcotic we know of. References toits use have been found in the Sumerian Tablets going back maybe 6,000 years.1[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1037961] The Sumerians called it the ‘joyplant’.2 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038074] It is also mentioned bythe Egyptians and the Greeks in around 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC respectively. Theopium poppy was such a part of Greece that they depicted it on their goldcoins.3 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038157] Traces of hallucinogenicdrugs were found in the grave of a South American Indian dating back 4,500 yearsand, throughout the ancient world, records of drug use can be found.

Certainly gives newmeaning to the phrase “Taking the piss”. The Aztecs used the hallucinogenicproperties of the Psilocybe Mexicana mushroom in their religious rites and theycalled it “God’s flesh”.5 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038336] Imentioned earlier the use of mushrooms by the Hebrew priests which even inspiredthe design of their headgear. The reptile-Aryan priests of Babylon were highlyskilled in their manipulation of the populace through drugs and this hascontinued in the secret society networks they spawned. The Rosicrucians expandedthe use of mind-altering drugs and the Assassins possibly got their very namefrom the way they employed drugs to mind control their killers. More thananything, drugs have been used by the Brotherhood throughout history to destroysocieties so they can be easily taken over. This is precisely what is happeningon a world scale today. But this policy is not new. Only the scale has changed.Most famously opium was the weapon used by the ‘British’ (the London-basedBabylonian Brotherhood) in the Opium Wars against China in 1840 and 1858.Chinese efforts to stop the flow of opium into their country were thwarted bythe might of the British Empire. Queen Victoria’s Foreign Secretary and PrimeMinister during the Opium Wars was Lord Palmerston, the Grand Patriarch orMaster of Grand Orient Freemasonry, and a member of the Committee of 300. ThePalmerstons were in fact the Temple family and their title goes back to 1723when Henry Temple became Baron Temple of Mount Temple, County Sligo, Ireland andViscount Palmerston of Palmerston, County Dublin, an Irish peer. Templeoriginates from Templar. This title was passed onto his grandson, also namedHenry, who was a member of the British House of Commons for 40 years and it washe who owned a painting by the artist, David Teniers, called St Anthony And StPaul, with its mass of sacred geometry, which has been connected by researchersto the coded manuscripts and mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau. Temple was livingat the time at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, later the home of Lord LouisMountbatten. The Mountbatten family also bought the Teniers painting. It was thesecond Lord Palmerston’s son, Henry John Temple, who became the legendary PrimeMinister, Foreign Secretary, and drug runner for the British Crown in China. Hemarried into the English aristocracy through the sister of Lord Melbourne, thePrime Minister at the start of Queen Victoria’s reign, and went on to lead theLiberal Party, also known as the Venetian Party, overseeing the British forcesin the Crimean War and the Opium Wars against China. He entered the House ofCommons for the first time as the member of Parliament for Newport on the Isleof Wight, a name which recurs far more often than you would expect for a smallisland off the south coast of England. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert hadOsborne House built on the island, and this is where she spent much of her timeafter Albert’s death. Lord Mountbatten would later be governor of the island.The Isle of Wight is a significant centre for Satanism as well as being a mostbeautiful place to visit. Another Brotherhood city is Edinburgh in Scotland,just down the road from the Sinclair’s Rosslyn Chapel. Palmerston spent threeyears in Edinburgh lodging with the Whig Party philosopher, Professor DugaldStewart, and Edinburgh University was a common connection between the members ofthe Lunar Society and Charles Darwin. The Brotherhood chosen one, Tony Blair,the British Prime Minister elected on May 1st 1997, was brought up in Edinburghand went to Fettes, a private school there. His father was a lecturer atEdinburgh University.The vehicle for the opium trade from India to China and elsewhere, was the EastIndia Company, a group of Scottish merchants and Freemasons who were alignedwith the Knights of St John of Jerusalem (Malta) and the Society of Jesus, theJesuits. Some researchers believe that the company’s real masters were thebanking families of northern Italy, the Black Nobility, but by then they werecentred in London, anyway. The strategy used by the British in China has becomea blueprint for invasion-by-drug-addiction ever since. They sponsored a massaddiction to opium until Chinese society and vitality was torn asunder. TheBritish Government used a network of terrorism and organised crime, like theTriads, the Hong Society, and the Assassins to carry out the trade on theirbehalf. These secret societies which ruthlessly eliminate anyone, especiallytheir own, who do not carry out orders, are merely threads in the same globalnetwork that connects with the Freemasons. They are, again, different masks onthe same face. The drug trade was (and is) organised by the Far East lodges ofFreemasonry. The Grand Lodge of England (current Grand Master, the Queen’scousin, the Duke of Kent) established lodges in China at Amoy, Canton, Foochow,Swatow, Chefoo, Chinkiang, Hankow, Newchang, Tongshan, Wei-Hai-Wei, two atTientsin, three in Shanghai, and five in Hong Kong.6[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038425] When the Chinese rulers acted tostop the supply of opium, the British used their military and naval might todefeat them. And the ‘peace’ treaty after the conflict then gave the British aguaranteed right to increase the flow of opium; to be paid compensation for theopium the Chinese rulers had confiscated; and to have sovereignty over strategicports and offshore islands and this is how Hong Kong came under British rule. Itwas used as the centre for Far East drug trafficking and that is still its roletoday after it has been returned to China. Most of the gold and moneytransactions on the Hong Kong financial markets are the payoffs and moneylaundering of the drug trade.The Treaty of Nanking of 1842 gave Britain control over Hong Kong, plus about£15 million in silver. It was written by the Freemason and Colonial Minister,Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), whose writings were to so inspire Hitler, theNazis, and mystics like Madame Blavatsky. Bulwer-Lytton wrote of the Vril power(serpent power) in the blood of the ‘underground supermen’. Bulwer-Lytton’s sonwas the Viceroy of India at the height of the opium trade between India andChina, a period ‘camouflaged’ by Rudyard Kipling’s writings about the BritishRaj (British drug runners). In the book The Opium Clippers, Basil Lubbock namesthe owners of the British vessels engaged in the opium trade through the EastIndia Company; Jardine Matheson (the Scottish Keswick family, many of whom areSatanists), Dent and Co; Pybus Bros; Russell and Co; Cama Bros; Duchess ofAtholl; the Earl of Balcarras; King George IV (formerly the Prince Regent); theMarquis of Camden; and Lady Melville. It was Lady Melville’s ancestor, George,who welcomed William of Orange to the throne and was made Lord Privy Seal as areward. The Keswicks and Jardine Matheson have been members of the Committee of300. Other Anglo-American families involved in the drug trade were theSutherlands, Barings, and Lehmans, cousins of the Rothschilds. The Sutherlands,one of the biggest cotton and opium traders in the American south, were cousinsof the Mathesons, and the Barings banking family founded the Peninsular andOrient Steam Navigation Company (the famous British ferry company P & O) totransport opium.The British reptilian bloodline families worked with their other Americanrelatives to expand the drug trade, as they still do today. The bloodlineRussell family made its enormous wealth from the opium trade in the nineteenthcentury through the drug syndicate known as Russell and Company. Its businesswas to take opium from Turkey and transport it illegally to China. Their onlyrivals were the Perkins syndicate, based in Boston, which had intermarried withother families of the British genetic lines who had been involved in the slavetrade. The Russells eventually bought out the Perkins and became the centre ofthe US opium racket in league with other reptilian families like Coolidge andDelano (Comm 300), both of which produced Presidents of the United States. Thehead of Russell and Co in Canton while all this drug racketeering was going onwas Warren Delano Jr, the grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt whocomes from English, Dutch, and French aristocratic bloodlines, including in theSpencer line of Princess Diana and Winston Churchill. In 1986, a history of thedrug trade in America, printed in US News And World Report, said that: “Delanoequated the opium trade with the liquor business – both profitable and bothcornerstones of the family business.”7[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038514] How appropriate that FranklinDelano Roosevelt should be genetically related to George Bush who stillmaintains the tradition of running drugs on an enormous scale. Other Russellpartners were John Cleve Green, who used some of his opium fortune to financePrinceton University; Abiel Abbott Low, who used his opium money to finance theconstruction of Columbia University; and Joseph Coolidge, whose son formed thedrug running operation called the United Fruit Company. His grandson, ArchibaldCary Coolidge, was a founding executive officer of the Council on ForeignRelations. The Russells with the Tafts formed the Skull and Bones Society andthe black flag with the white skull and cross bones was the corporate flag flownon all Russell Trust Company ships. It was also a flag flown on ships in theKnights Templar fleet. Another American connection to the opium trade was theFreemason, John Jacob Astor, the founder of the Astor dynasty who became astockholder in the British East India Company.8[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038641] Philadelphia and Boston, theheadquarters of the Northern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry,were (and are) other centres for the drug trade. A descendant of Astor, WaldorfAstor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, was a high degree Freemason whobecame chairman of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London afterthe Second World War.9 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038754] The RIIA isextensively involved in coordinating the global drug trade (see the book, DopeInc., in the bibliography).After the second Opium War which ended in 1860, the British merchant banks andtrading companies established the Hong Kong and Shanghai Corporation as thecentral bank of the Far East drug industry. According to all research I haveread about the drug network, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, with its globalconnections, continues to be a financial centre for the drug industry to thisday.10 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1038837] The Hong Kong and ShanghaiBank now calls itself HSBC Holdings since China regained Hong Kong and HSBC ownsone of the four British clearing banks, the Midland. It has since replaced theMidland name with its own. Anywhere in the world you see the logo of the red andwhite triangles, that’s the HSBC, the highly shifty Brotherhood cartel. TheNugan Hand Bank (based in Sydney, Australia) was another CIA/Mossad operationrun by Francis Nugan and Michael Hand, a Green Beret and a colonel in the USArmy assigned to the CIA. Hand was in frequent contact with George Bush afterhis election to Vice-President of the United States, according to CIA operative,Trenton Parker.11 [../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039039] Look at someprinciple officers of Nugan Hand Bank; Admiral F. Yates, president, the chief ofstaff for strategic planning of US forces in Asia and the Pacific during theVietnam War; General Edwin F. Black, president of the Hawaii branch, thecommander of US troops in Thailand during the Vietnam conflict; George Farris,operative with the Washington and Hong Kong branches of Nugan Hand, and amilitary intelligence specialist; Bernie Houghton, the Saudi Arabianrepresentative, a US Naval Intelligence undercover agent; Thomas Clines, ofNugan Hand in London, a director of training in the CIA’s clandestine servicewho was involved in the Iran-Contra affair and operated with Michael Hand andTheodore Shackley during Vietnam; Dale Holmgreen, of the Taiwan office, flightservice manager in Vietnam for Civil Air Transport, which later became theinfamous CIA airline, Air America; Walter McDonald, head of the Annapolis,Maryland, branch, the former deputy director of CIA economic research; GeneralRoy Mannor, the Philippines branch, the chief of staff for the US PacificCommand and the US government liaison with President Ferdinand Marcos; WilliamColby, Nugan Hand’s lawyer, a former director of the CIA.12[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039214] Just the kind of people you wouldexpect to be running a bank, eh? This was another drug operation. A director ofNugan Hand, Donald Beazley, was also chairman of City National Bank of Miami,which handled funds for the Mossadfront, the Anti-Defamation League.13[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039305]An Australian Government investigation revealed that millions of dollars inNugan Hand records were unaccounted for and that it was serving as a moneylaundering operation for drug traffickers. These profits were being used by theCIA to finance gun smuggling and illegal covert operations around the world.There was also evidence that the CIA was using the bank to pay for politicalcampaigns against politicians in many countries, including Australia, to ensurethe voters supported the CIA choice. Yes, this is still the ‘free’ world we aretalking about. Banks with household names across the planet are vehicles forlaundering drug money by passing it from account to account until its originsare lost in the web of transactions. The gold and diamond industry, dominated bythe Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers, through companies like De Beers, are alsoused to wash drug money. The money buys gold and diamonds from those companiesand they are then sold to produce ‘clean’ money. The network of interconnectingAnglo-American families in the Brotherhood web of manipulation, which has beenresponsible for the engineering of wars and for economic depression through thegenerations, is also behind the world illegal drugs market. Some of the mostfamous names, merchant banks, and companies in the world, are making the bulk oftheir fortunes directly or indirectly from the drug addiction of the young. Theyare the same families and organisations who were responsible for the slave tradefrom Africa and the ‘coolie’ trade out of China. The term ‘being shanghaied’comes from the kidnapping of Chinese people for shipment to the United States tobe used as servants. Alcohol prohibition was a means to create the massivenetwork of organised crime in the United States. The structure thus produced wasperfect, as intended, for drug trafficking once prohibition was over. The maingroups campaigning for prohibition and an end to the ‘evils of drink’, groupslike the Women’s Christian Temperance Union and its Anti-Saloon League, werefinanced by the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, and Warburgs, via the RockefellerFoundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and similar tax-exempt foundations.Prohibition was another con by the Brotherhood used for longer term motives.Incidentally, it also made a fortune for Joseph Kennedy, the father of JFK.Professor Alfred McCoy’s 1972 classic, The Politics Of Heroin In South EastAsia, and his 1991 update, The Politics Of Heroin – CIA Complicity In The GlobalDrug Trade, tell of how CIA helicopters in Vietnam were carrying drugs from thefields to distribution points, when the American public thought they were thereto fight Communism. He describes how a Pepsi Cola bottling plant was used forthis trade and how the media suppressed this information. 58,000 Americans andgoodness knows how many Vietnamese were killed in that conflict and nothing sumsup more powerfully the lack of respect this mindset has for human life, than theway the CIA smuggled drugs into America in plastic bags hidden in the bodycavities of dead soldiers being returned home from Vietnam for burial. CIAoperative, Gunthar Russbacher, has told how some bodies were gutted and filledwith drugs for shipment back to the States.14[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039519] The bodies carried secret codeswhich allowed those carrying the drugs to be identified on arrival at West CoastAir Bases, particularly the Travis Airforce Base in California. The drugs werethen removed and made available to the young people of America.Heroin is a derivative of the opium poppy which also produces morphine, a nameinspired by the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. It was at the Bayer laboratoriesin Germany in 1898 that heroin was created by adding ingredients to the morphinemolecule. Bayer would later be part of the I. G. Farben pharmaceutical cartel atthe heart of Hitler’s war machine. Heroin is the most addictive of all opiatedrugs, but it was marketed by Bayer as: “An heroic drug, without the addictivepotential of morphine”. The name heroin comes from ‘heroic’ and its creatorswere indeed heroes to the Brotherhood, given the potential it had to causeuntold strife and misery. Today the Far East heroin trade is still organised bythe Freemasons through their interconnected agents, the Triads. These are theMafia of the Far East and increasingly the Western World also, as in Vancouver,Canada. Just to give you another example of the way the game is played. TheChinese ruler before the Communist Revolution was Chiang Kai Shek, a member ofan earlier form of the Triads. The ‘Communist’ leader who toppled him from powerwas Mao Tse Tung, a Grand Orient Freemason!15[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039631] He allowed the British lease ofHong Kong to continue (of course, he did, he was a Brotherhood placeman) and thedrug-business-as-usual continued. By 1983, the Communist Chinese had ninemillion acres of poppy plantations and this is the foundation of the Chineseeconomy, just as it is for the Western economy.16[../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos1039753] Without the drug trade, the worldeconomy would collapse, so dependent has it become on the income and investmentsproduced by the destruction of human life. The Triads organise the production ofheroin in the so-called Golden Triangle. They are paid by the BritishBrotherhood bankers of Hong Kong in gold bullion and some of this is paid by theTriads to buy raw opium from the farmers. So the annual cycle goes on expanding.The cocaine trade out of South America is run by the same people through theiragencies like the CIA. Cocaine comes from the coca leaf and, until 1903, it wasused in the drink, Coca Cola, hence its name. I detail the CIA’s role in thecocaine networks and how they set up the Colombian drug cartels in …And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Also in that book you will find the background to theextensive involvement of George Bush and Bill Clinton in these operations.The drug trade is not only about making vast amounts of money, although that isimportant to fund the Agenda into place, it is also designed to break downsocieties and stop young people manifesting their true worth and potential. Whenpeople are hooked on drugs they are not going to be a problem to theBrotherhood’s grand design. Violence and crime always follows the drug trade asdrug dealers battle for supremacy and addicts mug and steal to finance theirhabit. This offers the Brotherhood a wonderful opportunity to offer the‘solution’ to this ‘problem’ – more power to the police and further erosion ofbasic freedoms. I saw an opinion poll in the Los Angeles Times a few years agoin which something like 84% of those questioned said they would give up basicfreedoms if they thought it would win the war on drugs.Problem-reaction-solution. What those people urgently need to know is that thedrugs are being distributed by those fronting the drug war, who are offering the‘solutions’ at the same time. Much of the ‘anti-drug’ network is deeply corruptand used as a vehicle for distributing drugs without detection. George Bush hasfronted more wars on drugs than any other American politician and yet he is oneof North America’s premier drug barons. A reporter on the San Jose Mercury Newsexposed the CIA’s involvement in putting crack cocaine into the black communityof Los Angeles. This was during the period Bush was in the White House and boththe journalist and the paper were hit by a tidal wave of ridicule and abuse fromthe establishment papers like the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times asthe Brotherhood tried to crush the story. Even the running of drugs comes downto bloodlines, by the way. A friend has a contact who was offered the job ofbeing a drug courier by a US government agency. He refused, but asked why theyhad approached him. “We know what your bloodline is,” came the reply. One of thecodes, he found out, was to have your hand cut across the palm. If you are evercaught, you show the authorities your hand and they let you go.The anti-drug agencies are controlled by the drug cartels and when you hear of‘big drug busts’, it is usually the Brotherhood eliminating the competition andgiving the impression of action. The drug pushers are difficult to find? Thenhow come a youngster straight off the bus in a new city can find them in anhour? If you are taking hard drugs, or thinking of doing so, remember this: Youare not being a ‘rebel’ or ‘dropping out’, you are committing mental, emotional,spiritual and eventually physical, suicide, and you are doing exactly what thepeople who control this world want you to do. The choice is yours, butunderstand the game before you start. There is only one winner when you get intodrugs. And it’s never you."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1013712] Scarlet And The Beast, p 15.2 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1013839] Ibid.3 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1014105] Ibid.4 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1014512] Ibid, p 11.5 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1014979] Ibid, p 13.6 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1020017] Ibid, p 31.7 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1023798] US News And World Report, August4th 1986.8 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1024886] Scarlet And The Beast, p 23.9 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1025338] Ibid.10 [../Text/index_split_036.html#filepos1025993] \"State Organised Crime, ThePresidential Address” by William J.

It has been a seamless processionthrough history of the same rituals to the same deities and this remains offundamental importance to the initiates of the Brotherhood today.My use of the term Satanism has nothing to do with the Christian version ofSatan. I use it only to describe a system of ritual sacrifice and torture which,staggering as it may seem to most people, is commonplace all over the worldtoday. Satanism is just another name for the worship of a highly destructive,negative force which has been given endless names over the centuries: Nimrod,Baal, Moloch or Molech, Set, the Devil, Lucifer, there is no end to them.Satanism perverts everything positive in the same way that the Nazis took apositive symbol, the swastika, and turned it around to symbolise the negative.This is why the Satanists invert the pentagram and why they use black tosymbolise the darkness, hence their Black Mass. But they also reverse thesymbolism of white and that is a powerfully negative colour to them. The Satanicnetworks, under the names of their various deities, were created by theBabylonian Brotherhood to serve their needs. We have seen that the accounts ofthe Watchers and their offspring, the Nefilim, include references to their blooddrinking activities. The Brotherhood know that blood contains the life-forceenergy. Drinking menstrual blood has always been a feature of the reptilianbloodlines because they need blood to live in this dimension. It was known asthe Star Fire, the female lunar essence. The female menstrual cycle is governedby the cycles of the Moon and the blood contains that energy. It’s ingredientsare supposed to ensure a long life. In India it was called soma and in Greece itwas ambrosia, some researchers suggest. This was said to be the nectar of thegods and it was – the reptilian gods who are genetic blood drinkers. The ‘holygrail’ chalice or cup is also symbolic of the womb and drinking menstrual blood,as well as being a symbol of the reptilian ‘royal’ bloodline itself. Menstrualblood was provided for the Elite of the reptilian ‘royal’ line by virginpriestesses and this is the origin of the term ‘Scarlet Woman’ or, to theGreeks, ‘Sacred Woman’. The Greek word for this, Hierodulai, was eventuallytranslated into English as harlot and into German as ‘hores’, the origin ofwhore. The word ritual derives from this practice (ritu = redness) and so do thewords rite and red. Menstrual blood is one reason why the colour red is soimportant to Satanists and it is another reason for the constant use of thecolour gold by the ‘royal’ bloodlines. Gold is called the metal of the gods, butto the Anunnaki of the Sumerian Tablets, menstrual blood could have been the‘gold of the gods’, as well as the mono-atomic variety.The reptilians and their crossbreeds drink blood because they are drinking theperson’s life-force and because they need it to exist in this dimension. Theywill often shape-shift into reptilians when drinking human blood and eatinghuman flesh, I am told by those who have seen this happen. Blood drinking is intheir genes and an Elite high priestess or ‘Mother Goddess’ in the hierarchy,who performed rituals for the Brotherhood at the highest level, told me thatwithout human blood the reptilians cannot hold human form in this dimension. Hername is Arizona Wilder, formerly Jennifer Ann Greene. Interestingly, she saidthat the reptilians had been pursuing the Aryan peoples around the universe,because the blood of the white race was particularly important to them for somereason and the blond-haired, blue-eyed genetic stream was the one they wantedmore than any other. They had followed the white race to Mars, she said, andthen came to Earth with them. It is far from impossible that theIlluminati-reptilian arrival on this planet in numbers was far more recent thaneven many researchers imagine. An interbreeding programme only a few thousandyears ago between the reptilian Anunnaki and white Martian bloodlines alreadyinterbred with the reptilians on Mars, would have produced a very high reptiliangenetic content. This is vital for the reasons I have explained earlier. Theyappear to need a particular ratio of reptilian genes before they can shape-shiftin the way that they do. But when the interbreeding happened is far lessimportant than the fact that it did happen.Satanism is based on the manipulation of energy and consciousness. These deeplysick rituals create an energy field, a vibrational frequency, which connects theconsciousness of the participants to the reptilians and other consciousness ofthe lower fourth dimension. This is the dimensional field, also known as thelower astral to many people, which resonates to the frequency of low vibrationalemotions like fear, guilt, hate and so on. When a ritual focuses these emotions,as Satanism does, a powerful connection is made with the lower fourth dimension,the reptilians. These are some of the ‘demons’ which these rituals have beendesigned to summon since this whole sad story began thousands of years ago. Thisis when so much possession takes place and the reptilians take over theinitiate’s physical body. The leading Satanists are full-blood reptilianscloaked in a human form. These rituals invariably take place on vortex pointsand so the terror, horror, and hatred, created by them enters the global energygrid and affects the Earth’s magnetic field. Thought forms of that scale ofmalevolence hold down the vibrational frequency and affect human thought andemotion. Go to a place where Satanic rituals take place and feel the malevolenceand fear in the atmosphere. What we call ‘atmosphere’ is the vibrational fieldand how it has been affected by human thought forms. Thus we talk about a happy,light or loving atmosphere, or a dark or foreboding one. The closer the Earth’sfield is vibrationally to the lower fourth dimension, the more power thereptilians have over this world and its inhabitants. Satanism is not just asickness and a perversion, although it is that also, its main reason forexistence, from the Brotherhood’s point of view, is to control the Earth’smagnetic field; to worship and connect with their reptile masters; to drink thelife-force of their sacrificed victims; and to provide energy for the reptilianswho appear to feed off human emotion, especially fear. These sacrifices are,literally, sacrifices to the ‘gods’, the reptilians, and they have beenhappening for thousands of years. The mass sacrifice of people by the Aztecs inCentral America, and so many others, were to provide food for the physicalreptilians and crossbreeds who eat the bodies and drink the blood, and energynourishment for the non-physical reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. PhilSchneider, a builder of US underground bases, told the writer and researcher,Alex Christopher, that when children reached the point where they could not workanymore in the slave conditions underground, they were consumed by thereptilians. They prefer young children because they are not contaminated likeadults. Hard to accept isn’t it? I’m sure your mind is screaming ‘nonsense’ atyou because who wants to face a truth like this? But unless we do, how is itever going to be stopped?Satanic rituals generally take place at night because that is when the magneticfield is most stable. During the day the electrically charged particles of thesolar wind cause turbulence in the field and make interdimensional connectionmore difficult. It is most stable during total eclipses and this is when nativepeoples held their most important ceremonies to contact and manifestother-dimensional entities. The tribal shamans know this. Satanic rituals andhuman sacrifice, especially of children, are performed on a vast scale andinvolve some of the most famous politicians, business people, media owners andentertainers on the planet. Of course they do. It would be amazing if they didnot, given the background. These rituals and human sacrifice have always beenthe foundation of the Brotherhood ‘religion’ since ancient times. And theBrotherhood manipulates its Satanic initiates and ‘gofers’ into the positions ofpolitical, economic, business, military, medical and media power, and intoinfluential positions in the world of entertainment. Therefore the ratio ofSatanists and child sacrificers at the top of these professions and institutionsis staggeringly high compared with the general population. Apparently, accordingto former Satanists I have met and read about, some world politicians areaddicted to blood taken from a victim at the moment of sacrifice because of theadrenaline which is produced at that time. I am told this addiction is quitecommon among Satanists, and researchers into the reptilian question suggest thatthis is the substance the reptiles also want. It all fits.The theme of human and animal sacrifice can be easily charted from the ancientworld to the present day. Ironically, but understandably in the context of thisbook, much of it was designed to preserve life rather than destroy it. Thebelief was that one sacrifice to appease ‘the gods’ would protect the lives ofmany more. This is another origin of the concept of the scapegoat, the onekilled for the ‘sins’ of others. This has, of course, manifested as manymythical religious ‘heroes’ who “died so our sins could be forgiven”. Thesacrifice of the king or ruler to appease the gods is another ancient tradition.In the so-called cradle of civilisation, North Africa and the Near East, wherethe Anunnaki and the Watchers were documented, there were human sacrifices,particularly of children. Similar rituals were prevalent in China, Rome, Africa,Asia, Greece, South America and, most famously, in Mexico where the Aztecssacrificed en masse to the ‘gods’. This region is where the former President ofMexico, Miguel De La Madrid, told the mind controlled slave of the CIA, CathyO’Brien, that the reptile extraterrestrials came down and created physicalbodies to occupy, just as they did most profusely among the Aryan people. Thereptilians and human sacrifice go together. Credo Mutwa talks of how theChitauri, the African name for the reptilians, insisted on human sacrifice andeven sacrificed some of their own. The Scandinavians buried children alive in aneffort to stop plagues and to appease the great god of the North, theScandinavian Odin or the German Wodan or Woden. The gods of the mystery schoolswere invariably connected to human sacrifice and it was these very schools whichhave, via the now global Brotherhood and Satanism networks, carried theknowledge and the rituals into the present day. The Incas of Peru sacrificedchildren and human sacrifice was practised from the earliest days in Europe. OneDruid ritual was to bury a child under the foundations of a new building or tosprinkle the child’s blood on the site. The same ritual can be found in manyparts of the world. In the stories of St Columba (dove, Semiramis), this‘Christian’ hero is said to have told his monks that it was fitting for one ofthem to be buried in the foundations of a new monastery on the Scottish islandof Iona (the Sun) to ‘hallow’ the ground. A Saint Oran volunteered and as aresult, it was believed, he went straight to heaven.1[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1123773] What a prat he must have felt whenhe left his body. Roman accounts by the historian, Tacitus, reveal how theDruids deemed it a duty to cover their altars with the blood of their captivesand how they consulted the gods via human entrails. The same stories can befound in Ireland and Scotland. Irish myth says that Ireland was first peopled bya greedy group of gods called the Formorians who demanded two thirds of thechildren born each year. The Phoenicians and their kinsmen, the Carthaginians,sacrificed humans on a large scale and so did the Canaanites. When Carthage wasstruggling in the war against Rome, 200 noble families sacrificed their sons toBaal (the Phoenician Sun god, Bel or Bil).2[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1123955]Another theme is the sacrifice of the first born child, most often the firstborn son. In some aboriginal tribes in Australia, the mother would kill and eatthe first born child to ensure she would be able to have more.3[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124044] The sacrifice of the first born ofanimals and humans was quite common and is mentioned in the Old Testament. TheBook of Kings tells how Mesha, the King of Moab, was so distraught by his defeatat the hands of the Israelites that he sacrificed his eldest son and heir.Remember in Genesis how ‘God’ (the gods) insisted that Abraham sacrificed hisfirst born son to them to test his faith and obedience. The same ritualcontinues today among the Satanists, the bloodline families of the Brotherhood,and their organised crime offshoots like the Mafia. Sacrificing the first bornson is used by these strange people as a way of testing a person’s commitment tothe cause.Yahweh-Jehovah makes it plain in the Book of Numbers that “…all thefirst born of Israel are mine, both man and beast,” and in Exodus, Yahwehdemands that “The first of all thy sons shalt thou give unto me.” The Bible saysthat Abraham came from the Sumer city of Ur and excavations in 1927 by SirLeonard Woolley in the Royal Cemetery there revealed widespread evidence ofhuman sacrifice in graves dating from about 2,800 BC. The Scythians, the peoplewho transported many of the Aryan bloodlines and rituals into Europe, did thesame. Evidence of human sacrifice, especially children, can be found among allthe main locations and peoples who are mentioned in this book, including thepalace of Knossos on Crete.4 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124172] Thecult of the skull as a focus of ritual has recurred again and again in thisstory with the Templars, the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery, and the Skull and BonesSociety in the United States. By examining the bodies of Peking Man, dating fromperhaps a million years ago, and Neanderthal man, dating from about 200,000years ago, evidence of such rituals can be found even at these early times. Thecult of the head, which included eating the brain of the victim, became moreelaborate in Jericho some eight thousand years ago and evidence of the samerituals have been found in the Shinto religion in Japan and in ancient China.Anath, the legendary sister of Baal, was portrayed festooned with severed headsalong with human hands hanging from her girdle, the same as the mother goddessesof Mexico and India.5 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124270]Written texts of ancient Egypt reveal many kinds of sacrifice and torture, whichlater became widespread.6 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124359] TheEgyptians would sacrifice red-headed men on the tomb of Osiris because red wasthe colour associated with Set, the Egyptian version of Satan. Some ritualsrecalled by people today who have suffered indescribably in these horrors,mirror those detailed in the Egyptian Book Of The Dead and include keepinghearts in a jar.7 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124448] The hearts wereplaced on the scales in Egypt to be weighed for judgement by the goddess, Maat.This is the real meaning of the woman with the sun crown holding the Scales ofJustice which you see on so many court buildings. In the ancient world, theBrahmin fakirs in India and other mystery schools knew of drugs, torture ritualsand ‘magic’ which created hallucinations. Silly fakirs. Hypnosis was widely usedin the temples. The demon worshippers of Bel/Baal/Nimrod in Canaan, Babylon andPhoenicia engaged in human sacrifice, cannibalism, and child murder in the nameof Moloch or Molech, an aspect of Nimrod/Baal, as part of their religiousrituals.8 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124562] Baal (lord or ruler),the supreme god of the Canaanites and Phoenicians, was said to be the giver oflife and Moloch was the destroyer of life. Both demanded appeasement bysacrifice. Baal or Moloch became identified with the Roman god Saturn.In honour of Baal, the Sun god and god of fire, the Carthaginians, following therituals of the Phoenicians and Canaanites, rolled children into a fiery pit madein the shape of the image of Baal/Moloch. At a site near modern Tunis sixthousand urns were found containing the charred remains of infants. Remember,these rituals and ‘gods’ are the same as those performed and worshipped by theSatanists and the Brotherhood today. This is why the children of Waco wereallowed to burn to death in an inferno caused entirely by the Satanistcontrolled FBI and the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, onApril 19th 1993. These were the same deeply sick people who blew up the James P.Murrah building in Oklahoma on April 19th 1995, in which so many children died.April 19th is a Satanic ritual day relating to fire – the fire god, Baal orMoloch. And what does Moloch demand? The sacrifice of children. Waco andOklahoma were child sacrifices to Baal/Moloch according to exactly the samebelief system as those performed by the ancients. In the same way, a war tothese people is a mass blood ritual in which unimaginable numbers are killed andmaimed, and the planet is engulfed by negative emotional energy. It is thisenergy on which many of the lower fourth dimensional reptilians either feed oruse to manifest in this dimension. If you want undeniable proof that the BranchDavidians and their children were sacrificed at Waco, I strongly recommend youwatch the video: Waco: The Rules Of Engagement. 9[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124673] You will never believe an officialstatement again. The ritual names for the ‘demons’ are still the same today asthose used in the ancient world and by later groups like the Templars.Confirmation of this comes from a stream of accounts by modern victims ofSatanism. A friend of mine, the British therapist, Vera Diamond, has beenworking for nearly 20 years with people who have been subjected to Satanic andmind control abuse. She says:“Children say the word Satan is used more frequently than any other, but otherdemons include Baphomet and Behemoth. Molech (Moloch) seems to be oneparticularly associated with eating babies, and one called Choronzon. These doseem to be particularly involved with sacrificing babies.”10[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1124882]Choronzon relates to Chronos, the Greek version of Nimrod. According to Greeklegend, Chronos swallowed his children as fast as they were born because hefeared they would overthrow him. Chronos was the most powerful of the Titans,the Greek name for the giants who resulted from the interbreeding of thereptilians with the human, ‘daughters of men’. Greek myth symbolically referredto them as children of the union between heaven (extraterrestrials) and Earth(humans). Chronos was the father of Zeus who survived because his mother hid himfrom her child-killing husband. Zeus later waged a victorious war against hisfather and other Titans and then ruled as the King of Gods over a dynasty awashwith child sacrifice. As you connect the different peoples across thegenerations, so you find the same themes of human sacrifice. TheCannanite-Hebrews were seriously into the sacrifice of humans and animals, muchas their spin doctors have tried to deny it over the years. The Satanists amongthe ‘Jewish’ hierarchy today still perform the same rituals while the mass ofthe Jewish people worldwide have no idea that this is so. Stories throughout thecenturies to the present day of the sacrifice of children by Jewish fanatics atthe time of the Passover can be seen to have an historical basis when yourealise the true meaning of the Passover. It had nothing to do with ‘God’passing over the homes of Israelite children and killing only the first bornEgyptians. This is more symbolism that only an initiate or a determinedresearcher would understand. Records from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, showthat the Israelites burned their sons on sacrificial fires in the Valley ofGehinnon outside Jerusalem.11 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125230] Theinfants were said to have been “passed over” or “passed through” the fire insacrifice to Moloch-Baal. In the Book of Leviticus we find the line: “Thou shaltnot let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Moloch”. The prophet Jeremiahtalks of the people: “burning their sons in the fire as burnt offerings untoBaal” and also in the Book of Jeremiah we are told that: “They have built thehigh places of Tophet, which is in the Valley of Hinnon, to burn their sons anddaughters in the fire…” John Milton also wrote of Moloch in his Paradise Lost:“First Moloch, horrid king, besmirched with blood,Of human sacrifice, and parent’s tears,Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,Their children’s cries unheard, that passed through fire,To his grim idol.”The Old Testament abounds with stories of animal and human sacrifice. The samesymbolism can be seen in a stream of ancient texts about the sacrifice of thefirst born or young children. The Jesus story includes this theme also, ofcourse. At it’s most extreme, the Jewish dogma is deeply sacrificial. Theirtemples were slaughterhouses with a constant supply of animals taken there forritual murder and sacrifice. Look at the Jewish form of killing animals to thistoday. Meat is only considered ‘kosher’ if the animal has its throat cut anddies by being bled dry. The same with the ‘halal’ meat of the Muslims. Throughthe Brotherhood bloodlines the ancient rituals have been strictly maintained andthe ruling Elite today are sacrificing children and drinking blood the same asthey did in the ancient world. The Hindu faith and the information for itssacred books, the Vedas, were taken to the Indian subcontinent by the Aryansfrom the Caucasus Mountains, one of the centres for extraterrestrials/innerterrestrials and their offspring. It is therefore predictable that the Vedascontain the same instructions for sacrifice to the gods. The Vedas, writtenabout 1,400 BC, list the names of the gods and the victim most suitable for eachone. In the modern world, annual victims have been offered to the Mother GoddessKali, the wife of the god, Shiva, and she was always believed to live off humanflesh. A male child was offered every Friday evening at the temple of Shiva atTanjor until the practice was stopped (officially) in the mid-nineteeth century.The Thugs, one of the ancient secret societies in the Brotherhood network,murdered their victims according to elaborate rituals dedicated to Kali, who isdepicted wearing a garland of skulls.Children or so-called ‘young virgins’ are used in these sacrificial ritualsbecause the Satanists and their reptilian masters want to access the purepre-pubescent energy for their own purposes. I have been told by Satanists, manyof their victims, and by therapists working with victims, the same stories of‘regeneration rituals’. The ageing Satanist, sometimes a high ranking member ofthe Brotherhood, stands in the centre of a circle of babies or young children.As they are sacrificed the ritual allows the Satanist to absorb theirlife-essense, their life-force, and regenerate his or her body. The world’s mostfamous Satanist, Aleister Crowley, who had connections to both Winston Churchilland the Nazis, advocated human sacrifice and admitted to sacrificing children.In his 1929 book, Magick In Theory And Practice, he explains the reasons forritual death and why small boys are the best victims:“It was the theory of the ancient magicians that any living being is astorehouse of energy varying in quantity according to the size and health of theanimal, and in quality according to its mental and moral character. At the deathof this animal this energy is liberated suddenly. For the highest spiritualworking one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest andpurest force. A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is themost satisfactory and suitable victim.”12[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125338]Crowley adds in a footnote that according to the records of the Satanist, FraterPerurabo, he performed just such a sacrifice 150 times every year between 1912and 1928. Think about that. It means that this one man ritually sacrificedalmost 2,500 young boys in that period alone. Do you still wonder what happensto many of the millions, yes millions, of children who go missing every year allover the world never to be heard of again? And that’s without all of those bredfor sacrifice that the public knows nothing about. We can begin to see that theestimates of ritual sacrifices every year are no exaggeration. Satanism at itscore is about the manipulation and theft of another person’s energy andconsciousness. In olden times they called it “soul snatching”. It may appear tobe merely a sickening perversion, but those who truly understand the backgroundto the rituals know that what really matters is the effect of the rituals, notso much the rituals themselves. They are the means to an end – stealing ormanipulating energy. Sex is so common in Satanic ritual because at the moment oforgasm, the body explodes with energy which the Satanists and the reptiles cancapture and absorb. Sexual activity inspired by love resonates to a much highervibration and therefore cannot be accessed by the reptilians. Sex during aSatanic ritual or sacrifice, however, explodes the orgasmic energy at a very lowfrequency because of the intent involved and so the energy of Satanic sexresonates to the reptilian frequency. The astrological energies constantlygenerated by the movement of the planets and the cycles of the Sun and Moon arealso employed to add to the power of the rituals. So there are particularSatanic days for their most important ceremonies. On these days unimaginablenumbers of people, mostly children, are sacrificed. Some of the main dates are:Feb 1/2, Candlemas; March 21/22, spring equinox; April 30th/May 1st, WalpurgisNight/Beltane; June 21/22, summer solstice; July 31/August 1, Lammas – GreatSabbat festival; September 21/22, autumn equinox; October 31st/November 1st,Samhain/Halloween; December 21/22, winter solstice or Yule.Let me emphasise again that these dates and festivals are not Satanic inthemselves. They are times in the annual planetary cycle when very powerfulenergies of various kinds are manifesting on the Earth and the rituals andceremonies of both a positive and negative nature are performed on these dates.The cycle produces the energy and the Satanists simply harness that energy fortheir own purposes, just as the positive rituals do, like those performed bymost modern Druids. Other dates for widespread Satanic ritual include every fullMoon because the reflected energy of the Sun is at its most powerful on thoseoccasions. Note also the significance to Satanists of May 1st, the day theBavarian Illuminati was formed in 1776 and the day of celebration in theBrotherhood-created Communist and Socialist calendar.The Key of Solomon is a book of occult magic which legend claims was written by‘King Solomon’ himself. It includes the pentagram in its instructions of how toinvoke demons and make sacrifices to demons. Such ancient works provide thefoundations for the same rituals in each generation. The inner core of theKnights Templar was involved in black magic ritual and the Templars were accusedof what today we call Satanism and of rejecting Christianity by denying Christand spitting on the cross. They were said to worship a demon power calledBaphomet, a black magic symbol, also known as the Goat of Mendes. Capricorn (thegoat, also symbolised by the unicorn) is the sign of the initiate and itrepresents political power, while Leo (the Sun, the lion) represents royalpower. Hence the lion is the King of the Jungle and is the main symbol on theflag of the British royal family. The planet Saturn rules Capricorn while theSun rules Leo and Satanists and black magicians are very much focused on the Sunand Saturn in their rituals. The Saturn vibration has a much bigger impact onthe Earth than is recognised. In astrology it is the planet of law andauthority. Capricorn, the sign of authority, is also, according to astrologers,the astrological sign of England, that centre of global control. The name,Baphomet, is reckoned to derive from Greek words meaning baptism of wisdom orknowledge (initiation) and Dr Hugh Schonfield, one of the experts on the DeadSea Scrolls, says that using the code of the Essenes, the word Baphomet can betranslated to ‘Sophia’, the goddess of the Gnostics, and the Greek word forwisdom.13 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125498] Sophia is another namefor the female energy. Schonfield is sure there is a link between the Templarsand the Essenes and so am I. He has demonstrated that the Templars used the samecode, the Atbash Cipher, employed in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls.14[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125614] Other accusations against theTemplars were of killing children and teaching women how to abort.15[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125732] It is true that most of theseconfessions were made under extreme torture by the Roman Church Satanists, theInquisition. But not all of these reports were gleaned in this way and thethemes are so strong, and the story so consistent, that it would be ridiculousjust to dismiss them all. And one thing is quite provable. These very ceremoniesinvolving the ritual murder of children, and the use of women called breeders toproduce babies and aborted foetuses for sacrifice to a demon ‘god’, are mostcertainly performed today and this Satanic structure of abuse and ritual murderis controlled by the very secret society network the Templars helped to expand.The testimony of one Templar, Squin de Flexian, said they all had to swear neverto leave the Order and to further its interests by any means, right or wrong. Nocrime committed for the honour or benefit of the Order was considered to besinful. He also made allegations about sacrificing babies and abortingfoetuses.16 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125849]It is the same with the inner circles of the Freemasons. Credo Mutwa, the Zulushaman, told me that compared with the Freemason rituals he had seen in theUnited States and the United Kingdom, the voodoo and black magic of Africa wasput in the shade. The secret password of Freemasonry is Tubal Cain, a descendantof the biblical Cain, who was an Anunnaki crossbreed. Tubal Cain’s sister,Naamah,17 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1125956] is said to have been theone who brought human sacrifice and cannibalism into the world.18[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126068] Tubal Cain is known as the fatherof witchcraft and sorcery and thus his name is a Freemasonic password.19[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126152] The ‘G’ on the symbol ofFreemasonry stands for Gnosticism (knowledge, knowing), for Geometry of the‘sacred’ variety and for Generation, the fertility rites of the sex cults ofancient Baal and Ashtoreth.20 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126236] Nodoubt it is also a symbol connected to generation and genetics, as in thereptilian bloodlines. You see the ‘G’ in the logo of the Gannett chain which hasbeen buying up newspapers and television stations across the United States andpublishes the national daily, USA Today. 21[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126320] The de Medici bloodline of theBlack Nobility in Venice, who funded Christopher Columbus, included Catherine deMedici (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the Queen of France, who was reported to havecommissioned human sacrifice in a Black Mass in the 16th century. Her doctor wasNostradamus. A young boy was sacrificed and the blood used in a communiondesigned to save her dying son, Philip.22[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126410] Medici wore around her neck atalisman with the name of the Satanic demon, Asmodei.23[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126523] Benjamin Franklin, a so-calledpillar of the Christian Church and Founding Father of the United States, was amember of the Satanic Hellfire Club and the bodies of six children and fouradults have been found under his former home in London dated to the time helived there. Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were Satanists and so were their‘opponents’ like Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. TheRothschilds, formerly the infamous German occult family, the Bauers, apparentlyuse the Canaanite Satanic rituals24[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126607] while some of the bloodlinefamilies with long connections to the Celtic lands, like the St Clair-Sinclairs,prefer the Druid system.25 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126722] It wasthe Satanic deity, Ashtoreth, which inspired the name, Astor, one of thebloodline families which has been heavily involved in Satanism.26[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126806] The Astors have close connectionsto the British royal family and they were at the heart of the Profumo scandal in1963 when the British Defence Minister, John Profumo, was forced to resign afterlying to the House of Commons about his involvement with Christine Keeler, acall girl who was also having a sexual relationship with a Russian KGB agent.The Profumo-Keeler liaison was arranged by Stephen Ward, a sadomasochist andblack magician, who lived in a house on the Astor estate at Clivedon inBerkshire. There was much more to this than was allowed to come out and if itever does it will once again shine a light on some very dark practices andconnect with the highest echelons of British society, including the Windsors.Prince Philip knew Stephen Ward and Lord Mountbatten was a guest at the infamous‘swimming party’ at Cliveden which played a major role in Profumo’s downfall.What is called Satanism is the ruling hierarchy of the Brotherhood pyramid underthe command of the reptilians. Like all the other parts of the network, it isstrictly compartmentalised. The highest levels of the Satanic network lock intothe highest levels of the Brotherhood, but the lower degrees are not allowed toknow the true nature of the organisations they are involved in. Some of thelevels of Satanism are known as the Sisters of Light, the Five Star Generals,Master Counsellors, Keeper of the Books, Keeper of the Seals, and there is oneposition called an Asmodeus.27 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1126925] Oneof the global centres of Satanism is the Castle of Darkness, the Chateau desAmerois or Castle of Kings, in Belgium, near the appropriately named village ofMuno Bel. The castle is close to the French border and not that far fromLuxemburg. It is protected from view by thick forests and guards keep out thecurious. In the grounds is a cathedral with a dome containing 1,000 lights.28[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127015] When President George Bush talkedof 1,000 points of light, he was speaking in code about this place of initiationfor the highest initiates of the Satanic pyramid. In this Satanic cathedral isthe throne of the high priestess of the upper hierarchy, a position known as theQueen Mother.29 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127131] Every day,apparently, a child is sacrificed in the basement.30[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127215] Ceremonies are performed here tothe Satanic ‘goddess’ known as Lilith, a demon in the Hebrew Cabala. In ancientSumer the reptilian bloodline, as passed on through the female, was symbolisedas a lily and the main reptilian gene carriers were given names like Lilith,Lili, Lilutu and Lillette. Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth) is a derivative of this.Another demon used by some ‘Mothers’ is called Bilair, Bilar, and Bilid,cabalistic names for the force others call Satan, etc.31[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127299] It is from these lands in Belgiumand northern France that the bloodline families came, including the Bruces, totake over Scotland all those centuries ago. Belgium, this little country betweenFrance and the Netherlands, is also the home of the European Union, NATO, and, Iam told, a massive computer centre where databases on all the people of theworld are being compiled. It is known apparently as ‘the Beast’ and there are anumber of these around the world. An Elite mind control operation called theJanus Group is also based in the NATO headquarters and headed, apparently, bythe United States publisher William F. Buckley, a major Illuminati figure.Nimrod was Eannus, the god with two faces, who was later known to the Romans asJanus. The reason that Belgium is a headquarters for Satanism and so manyBrotherhood institutions is very simple. The Brotherhood created Belgium(BELgium) for just this reason in 1831 and they imposed upon it a reptilian‘royal’ line, the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Ramses-Piso-Bush), the bloodlineof the British royal family and, through its branch in Prussia, the supportersof Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati.The paedophile murder ring which came to light in Belgium in 1996 is but onepart of the Satanic network operating from and in that country. It was organisedby Marc Dutroux, who is connected to the Satanic Order of Abrasax, based in thevillage of Forchies-la-Marche near Charleroi in southern Belgium, not far fromthe Castle of Darkness. Abrasax is Abraxas, a fat-bellied demon from whom, it islikely, the magicians term, abracadabra, originated. Dutroux buried alive anaccomplice, Bernard Weinstein, and among Weinstein’s effects was a letter fromthe Abrasax group signed by someone describing himself as the Egyptian god,Anubis. It ordered him to provide ‘presents’ for the High Priestess of the Orderand apparently gave specific details of the age and sex the victims must be. TheBritish Sunday Times reported the accounts of witnesses describing Black Massesin which children were killed in front of audiences which included prominentmembers of Belgian society.32 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127390] ABelgian newspaper reported that a former commissioner of the European Union wasamong a group of judges, senior politicians, lawyers, and policemen, whoattended orgies at a Belgian chateau organised by Michel Nihoul, one of theaccomplices of Marc Dutroux, the alleged leader of the paedophile ring. Oneinvestigator said it was “Like going back to the Middle Ages”.33[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127556] In fact there has not been an old,middle, and modern age with regard to these rituals. It is a seamless flow overthousands of years under the control of the same bloodlines. Human skulls werefound at the sacrificial sites identified by witnesses, particularly at thesect’s headquarters. The Satanic group behind the Belgian murders is said tointerconnect with similar rings in Holland, Germany, and America.34[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127640] In truth, it will be part of theglobal network which operates in all countries. Satanism is run like atransnational corporation.Black magic rituals are going on all over the world and I have spoken withvictims in country after country. In England I met a brave woman, then aged 40.The story she told me of her experiences mirrored those of so many others. Shewas born in Darlington in the 1950s, and soon after she was sold by her Satanicfather to two other Satanists. She knew them only as Thomas and Helena. She wasbrought up in the most horrific circumstances at a children’s home in Hull whichwas run by two child abusers. At night a torchlight was shone into theirbedrooms and when it was held on a child for a minute or so, they knew it wastheir turn to go downstairs and be sexually abused. During holidays back inDarlington, from the age of just seven and eight, she met her father who linkedher with the two Satanists, Thomas and Helena. She would be given drugs viaorange juice and ice cream and be taken at night in a van to country churches inthe Darlington area. The drugs were designed to make her easier to mind controland to prevent her from remembering what she saw. I will explain more about thisin the next chapter. However, as is often the case when people enter their 30sand 40s, the victims can begin to have flashbacks of their ordeals. Theyexperience them again like watching a movie screen. It is for this reason thatso many are murdered before they reach that age, often for ‘snuff’ videos, whichshow in graphic detail a person being murdered. Others are subjected to thesnatch back when they are abducted to undergo ‘booster’ mind-programming to keepthe memories secret. Increasing numbers of people who survived their horrendousyoung lives, are now beginning to remember and they are telling the same basictale. If you are one of them, please contact me if you have anything to add towhat I outline here. An address is at the back of the book. Within days ofspeaking to me, my informant says she was grabbed off the street and bungledinto a van by six Satanists. A syringe was held to her throat and she was warnedto stop talking to “That dangerous prat, Icke” and to stop naming names. Theythreatened her life and those of her children if she continued. She was alsotold that if she didn’t keep quiet, the family dog would be taken and “Postedback to you in pieces”. Nice people.In the ordeals at the country churches which she now remembers, my Englishinformant and other children would be used in Satanic rituals involving sex,torture, and murder. The windows of the church were covered over with blackdrapes and the inside was laid out according to Satanic law with differentcolours used for different ceremonies depending on the time of year. Sometimesthey would use the churches in secret, but don’t underestimate how many peoplein the Christian clergy are also members of the Satanic network. The Satanists,she remembers, were dressed in robes and a number wore masks, including the faceof a goat or Baphomet, the deity the Templars were accused of worshipping. Inthe UK, as in America, some of the best known names in the country are involved.She remembers vividly (God, the thought of it), being laid on her back on thefloor of a church as a screaming boy, no more than six, was being held by thehair above her while a man, who she would later identify as a top politician inNorthern Ireland, had anal sex with him. When it was over, a knife was producedto cut the boy’s throat and the blood poured over her. “I remember this man’seyes,” she told me. “The coldness of his eyes I will never forget.” He prefersboys to girls, she said.On more than one occasion, she says, she was brutally raped by a man who hasbeen a major name in United Kingdom politics for decades. This man, she says,used to hold her naked body to him by using hooks inserted into her flesh at thehip. She was just a little girl when this was happening. She told me that thisman was Edward Heath and his name comes up again and again in interviews withvictims of Satanic abuse in Britain. Heath was the UK Prime Minister from1970–74 and the Bilderberg Group member who signed the UK into the EuropeanCommunity, now Union. He has been one of the main architects of Britain’sfurther integration into the United Fascist States of Europe. One of the manyunconnected people who have identified Heath as a Satanist was the lady Imentioned early in the book who saw the ‘lizard’ figure at Burnham Beeches inBuckinghamshire, a short drive from the British Prime Minister’s officialcountry residence called Chequers. The game of chequers is played on a board ofblack and white squares – the floor plan of all Freemasonic temples. BurnhamBeeches is not far from High Wycombe and the headquarters of the Hellfire Clubof Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood. I’m sure Burnham Beeches wouldhave been one of their haunts, too. This lady was the wife of the Head Keeper atBurnham Beeches and they lived on the land. She had been brought up by a Satanicfamily in Scotland and had been sexually and ritually abused as a child by theScottish Brotherhood network. Her husband was also a Satanist which is why hewas given the responsibility of looking after Burnham Beeches, an area ofancient groves and forests managed by the City of London (logo, two flyingreptiles) and including an area called Egypt Wood. Late one night in the early1970s during Heath’s reign as Prime Minister, she was taking her dog for a walkwhen she saw some lights. Quietly she moved closer to see what was going on. Toher horror she saw that it was a Satanic ritual and in the circle was the thenPrime Minister, Edward Heath, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, AnthonyBarber. She says that as she watched him, Heath began to transform into areptile and she said that what surprised her was that no-one in the circleseemed in the least surprised. “He eventually became a full-bodied Reptiloid,growing in size by some two foot.” She said he was “slightly scaly” and “spokefairly naturally, although it sounded like ‘long distance’ – if you can imaginethe short ‘time’ lapses”. I remember well meeting Heath on a television electionprogramme in 1989 while I was a spokesman for the British Green Party and I havenever seen such cold and unpleasant eyes in my life. I knew nothing of thesesubjects then, but the look of his eyes I have never forgotten. When a reportertold Heath what I had written about him in this book, his only response was: “Ihope David Icke recovers from his illness.”Another famous paedophile and Satanist in Britain is Lord McAlpine, the formertreasurer of Heath’s Conservative Party, and executive of the McAlpineConstruction empire. He also followed the late Jimmy Goldsmith as head of theReferendum Party in Britain which was created to hijack the groups opposing theEuropean Union and lead them to glorious failure. McAlpine, who is heavilyinvolved in a network of Brotherhood secret societies, including the Freemasons,has been publicly named as a paedophile by the investigative magazine,Scallywag. 35 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127724] He was accused ofhaving oral sex with an underage boy in 1965 and was formerly cautioned byStrathclyde Police for sexual offences against a minor. McAlpine was also namedby one of the former residents at the Bryn Alyn Children’s Home in North Waleswho said he was forced to have oral sex with him. The McAlpine family is one ofthe Elite bloodlines of Scotland, possibly connecting with the ancient Scottishking, Kenneth McAlpin. The McAlpine family has a long history of Satanism in itsranks, as does the Scottish Keswick family. Both are part of a web whichoperates across the world into the Far East and Australia. A close friend of theMcAlpines was Willie Whitelaw, a chairman of the Conservative Party. He was alsoDeputy Prime Minister to Margaret Thatcher, who was ‘minded’ by Whitelaw, theMcAlpines, and Sir Geoffrey Howe, during her years as Prime Minister. When shehad outlived her usefulness to the Brotherhood, it was Howe who made the speechin the House of Commons which effectively ended her reign. Whitelaw was named asa leading Satanist by self-confessed Satanist, Derry Mainwaring-Knight, atMaidstone Crown Court in 1986. As usual, nothing was done about it.36[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1127879] Mainwaring-Knight lived near EastGrinstead, one of the centres of Satanism in England. In Scotland, a foremostSatanic centre is Loch Ness, near Inverness, the home, according to the legend,of the famous reptile, the Loch Ness monster. So what could these legends reallybe symbolic of? Aleister Crowley, the best known Satanist of the 20th century,had a house at Loch Ness and it was to this area that he came to perform some ofhis most powerful black magic rituals. A rock formation near the loch called theRock of Curses has been used by black magicians for hundreds of years andCrowley was particularly drawn to the energy emanating from a nearby mountainknown as Mealfuorvonie.37 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128073] There ismuch more to the legend of the Loch Ness Monster than meets the eye and the sameis true of other unidentified creatures like the so-called Bigfoot. Some NativeAmerican shamans believe that the entity which manifests as the Bigfoot can alsoappear as an aquatic monster or a panther because it has the ability toshape-shift.38 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128199]Over and over I have been told by survivors of how they were abused orprogrammed at the stately homes of the aristocracy or in rooms under the BritishMuseum and other official buildings in London. Names of Conservative governmentministers keep recurring in survivor’s accounts. Another paedophile is theformer Leicester member of Parliament, Greville Janner, a vociferous campaignerfor Jewish causes in Britain. A notorious location for paedophile activities isan apartment block called Dolphin Square in Pimlico, the biggest block of flatsin Europe and the London residence of many members of Parliament. The buildinghas been under surveillance by the British Customs after the discovery ofpornographic material from Amsterdam. One resident was quoted as saying: “Weoften have underage boys wandering in the corridors totally lost, asking for theflat of a particular MP.” Pimlico has been nicknamed ‘Pimp-lico’ because of thewidespread use of boy prostitutes known as rent boys. The Dolphin Squareresident, David Steel, the Scottish former leader of the Liberal Democrats, hasactively supported campaigns for ‘gay rights’ by Ian Campbell Dunn, a planningofficer at Edinburgh District Council. But Mr Campbell wants rather more thanjust ‘gay rights’. He is a founding member of the Paedophile InformationExchange (PIE), which wants to legalise sex with children.39[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128289] Should Mr Steel be supporting sucha character? The former cabinet ministers, Michael Portillo and Peter Lilley,are apparently regular diners at the restaurant in Dolphin Square along withmany famous political figures. I wonder what the attraction can be? Must be thefood. Yes, definitely the food.People think that ritual abuse and sacrifice, if it exists at all, is rare. Likehell it is. Human sacrifice and ritual abuse is rampant. Look at the Satanicchild abuse and murder network exposed in Belgium which involves the police,judges and top politicians. The same is coming to light in North Wales and otherareas of the UK. The lack of interest by the media is stunning, if notsurprising. Ted Gunderson, a man of 28 years experience with the FBI, told amind control conference in the United States that after long and detailedresearch, he estimates there are 3.75 million practising Satanists in the US andbetween 50 and 60,000 human sacrifices a year. Therapists at the conference saidthat their clients had pointed to a massive Satanic grave site in open landoutside Lancaster, California.40 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128429]Another exists, apparently, at Matamoros, Mexico. The Satanic ritual networkconnects into the children’s homes, care centres, and runaway hostels to ensurea constant supply of children. Please tell me what you know.A short while before this book was sent to the printer, I was contacted by afriend in the United States who was deprogramming a mind controlled slave of theBrotherhood called Arizona Wilder. I will explain how this mind control is donein the next chapter. She had been mind controlled from childhood to be aso-called Mother Goddess, who conducts sacrificial rituals at the highest levelsof the global Brotherhood. Arizona was one of only three women at that level inthe world, she says. She has performed rituals for the British royal family, asyou will see in the chapter, The Goddess and the King. She was genetically bredfor this job and her mother is of French noble descent. Arizona told me that thereptilians do not appear to be that psychic, and I guess this has something todo with the lack of a fully formed emotional and spiritual level of being, andso they mind control and programme humans of particular bloodlines, like her, toperform the rituals and draw in the energies for them. She says she waspersonally programmed by Josef Mengele (she knows him as Green or Greenbaum), ashape-shifting reptilian, and the infamous Nazi mind controller and geneticmanipulator, who escaped at the end of the war with the help of British andAmerican Intelligence to continue his horrors in the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, and South America. He once showed her a spider a foot wide which he hadgenetically developed and he introduced her to Adolf Hitler in the United Statesin the 1960s, she says. She has described many top secret facilities in theUnited States which my friend has personally seen himself and every time she hasbeen 100% accurate. She says that each of the ruling 13 families of the globalBrotherhood have their own council of 13. The most powerful council in theUnited States is based in California and among the members are Robert Caldwell,his son Richard, Jim Christensen, Richard Hoehn, Richard Bradbury, Jim Efferson,Fred Danger and Frank Cohen. But the head of that council, and thehighest-ranked member of the Illuminati (Brotherhood) that she knows, is a mancode-named Pindar from the Alsace-Lorraine region of France. Pindar means ‘Penisof the Dragon’. His name, Arizona says, is the Marquis de Libeaux. I have notyet established if this is his real name or another pseudonym – can you help?Libeaux relates to ‘of the water’ and is consistent with the ancient legends ofreptilian gods coming from the water. She says that in the basement of hischateau in Alsace-Lorraine there is an opening into the subterranean world. Notethe area – Lorraine, home to key reptilian bloodlines going back many centuriesas I outlined earlier through the Ramses-Piso-Bush House of Lorraine. This mindcontrolled high priestess/Mother Goddess was impregnated by Pindar, she says,but her own mind began to reject the programming and she aborted the foetus andbroke with the Brotherhood. As often happens, her programming began to breakdown when her programmer, Mengele, died in the late 1980s. Arizona says thatPindar, like all the reptilians when they shape-shift, has very powerfulhypnotic eyes (the ‘evil eye’ of legend) and at sacrifices the victim’s face isturned to Pindar at the moment of death for him to steal the person’s soul orenergy through this ‘evil eye’ magnetic process. Credo Mutwa tells the samestory of the reptilian Chitauri.The following is information that has been supplied by Arizona: Pindar attendsthe major Satanic ceremonies in Europe and then flies to California for therituals there. Beltane used to be celebrated in Trebuco Canyon in Orange County,California, but due to urban sprawl, the rites are now conducted in nearbyBlackstar Canyon, which is closed to the public. Local streets are also cordonedoff by members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. The Samhain ritual isconducted at the Eastside Christian Church located at the junction of 7th Avenueand Obispo in Longbeach. Outside the church is a logo of a white dove with a redgoblet between its wings. This is Semiramis again and white is considered ademonic colour by these people, hence Pindar, the ‘Marquis de Libeaux’, travelsin a white limousine. (A ‘code-white’ is a code understood by judges, police,the military, etc, and it means: look the other way or do not prosecute thisperson). Military guards carrying automatic weapons protect the church andinquisitive outsiders are ritually murdered and disposed of at the mortuary downthe street, she says. The Walpurgis ritual takes place at the west side ofCatalina Island. The Coastguard vessel, Golden Eagle, takes sacrificial childrenwho can’t swim across to the site and they are thrown overboard. The bodies arerecovered and placed in cages filled with starving sharks for disposal.At outdoor rituals, Arizona says she wore a red robe and stood in the centre ofa pentagram which was surrounded by a hexagram or Star of David. She wastriggered into her ‘Isis’ program and conducted the Drawing Down of the Moonceremony which, she says, made four snarling, hideous creatures materialise inthe Satanists’ circle. The sacrificial victims, who have been bred from birthfor the role, are ritually killed by slashing the throat from left to right.This is the origin of the Freemasonic sign of pulling the flat hand across thethroat from left to right, a movement which means “You’re dead”. The blood fromthe victims is collected and mixed with arsenic, which appears to be a necessaryelement for those of the human-reptilian bloodlines. This is poured into gobletsand consumed by the Satanists, together with the liver and eyes. This issupposed to provide strength and greater psychic vision. Fat is scraped from theintestines and smeared over the bodies of the participants – like the fat of the‘messeh’ in ancient Egypt. The corpse is then suspended from a tree and theSatanists stand naked to allow the dripping blood to fall on them. The MotherGoddess says that by this time the participants are in such a high state ofexcitement that they often shape-shift into reptilians and mostly manifest, shesays, in a sort of off-white colour. They are also terrified, because at thispoint the Mother Goddess points to four of them and they are then rituallymurdered. Clare Reeves, the President of Mothers Against Sexual Abuse in the US,told me that at least 12 ritually abused clients had reported that theparticipants shape-shifted into reptilians. Another ritual takes place in OrangeCounty at Dana Cove Point in which a pregnant woman is drowned and her babyremoved. The British royal family, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, GeorgeBush, the two Bush Governor sons, Henry Kissinger, Newt Gingrich, Bill andHillary Clinton, Rothschilds, Habsburgs, Bob Hope, Rupert Murdoch and a streamof other famous names have all attended sacrificial rituals at which this MotherGoddess has presided, Arizona says. Most of those names – perhaps all – areRamses-Piso-Bush. Arizona says that Hillary is the power that controls BillClinton because she is far higher up the hierarchy than him. He is mindcontrolled, she says, and Hillary is his handler. She also reports that she hasseen reptilians, Greys, and reptile-human hybrids at many undergroundfacilities, including the infamous Area 51 in Nevada. She says that astronautNeil Armstrong took pictures on the Moon of translucent structures and anunderground habitat. These pictures are, apparently, in a building in OklahomaCity. The Mother Goddess said that she had also conducted Satanic ceremonies inFrance involving Pope John Paul II. Another source within the mind controlcommunity reports that the Pope is also a mind contolled stooge and a contactwith relatives in the Vatican told me that they were slowly poisoning the Popeto ensure that he dies in time for their chosen one to replace him at the righttime. We should expect, he said, to see the Pope looking more and more frail andsick in the weeks and months ahead.What the victims have told me would be almost unbelievable were it not comingfrom so many different, unconnected sources and were not the stories across theworld not telling the same basic tale, even down to the details of the ritualsand the mind programming techniques. The children, and the traumatised adultsthey become, have nowhere to turn. Their stories are so astonishing that fewbelieve them and they are frightened of going to the police because they knowthat the Satanic network includes top police officers, judges, civil servants,media people, politicians, and many others who control our ‘free’ society.Questions like “Who are you going to tell?” and “Where are you going to run?”are used to break their spirit. Their sense of hopelessness makes them thinkthere is nothing they can do to seek justice, so they give up and stop trying.The vast majority of Freemasons are not Satanists or child abusers, but there isa far greater ratio of them in secret societies like the Masons, than outside.How can you have confidence in justice therefore when, for instance, the Manorof St James’s Freemasonry Lodge, No 9179, consists of the leading operationalpolice officers from all the major units of London’s Metropolitan Police,including the Anti-Terrorist Squad, Fraud Squad, and the ComplaintsInvestigations Branch which is supposed to investigate allegations of policewrong-doing! The St James’s Lodge further includes senior figures from the HomeOffice, judiciary, and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, which decides ifa person will or will not be prosecuted. The whole system of investigation,prosecution, and trial, or the suppression of them, can be achieved by membersof this one lodge working together. What chance has a child got against that?Also, as many of the victims have said, they themselves are drugged andprogrammed to take part in the ritual murder and torture of other children. Thisis videoed and played back to them when they are in a conscious state. They areso horrified at what they have done and so terrified of the consequences thatthey dare not speak to the authorities. Other techniques to prevent exposureinclude abusing children while wearing a Mickey Mouse face or a Devil’s head.When little children say they were abused by Mickey Mouse or the Devil it makesthem even less likely to be believed. One woman who contacted me said that herfather sexually abused her while wearing a Devil’s head and it was a long timebefore she realised that her father was responsible. The stories of the people Ihave talked to, and the accounts of others I have read, tell of events that arebeyond comprehension or, at least, they would be if they were not actuallyhappening. Drinking blood, eating the flesh of dead bodies, thousands of adultsand children buried in deep graves, the murder of people on camera for theso-called ‘snuff’ videos, the story is just appalling. One mother told atelevision documentary in the Dispatches series on Channel Four in the UK, ofhow she was forced to place her new-born baby on a Satanic altar and push aknife through its heart. A Satanist then had sex with the dead body. This ishappening in your country NOW!Many of the victims are born into Satanic families and others are bred forsacrifice through the use of breeders: women kept in captivity to give birth toone child after another which are never formerly registered and so, according toofficial records, they don’t exist. You can’t murder someone who doesn’t existand so these children and foetuses are sacrificed without anyone outside thecircle knowing the children have even been born. The Ku Klux Klan, the Aryanmaster race fanatics created by the Freemason Satanist, Albert Pike, are one ofthe endless groups who keep women under lock and key for this purpose.41[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128555] These groups have their ownmidwives who supervise the births and they are also born in hospitals under thesupervision of staff loyal to the Brotherhood and their Satanic ritualoffshoots.42 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128670] Other children fromnon-Satanic families are taken away at birth and the parents are told theirchild has died when in fact they are taken away to be sacrificed or to be usedin the mind control projects I will discuss in the next chapter. Low incomeparents, and those addicted to drugs, are at the mercy of the Freemasons andSatanists operating among the social services hierarchy and judges. Theirchildren are often taken away from them for Satanic ritual or mind controlprojects. So called ‘crack’ babies are apparently sought after for mind controloperations, as are twins. I know of twins who were crack babies in Denver,Colorado, a major Satanic centre. They were first taken from their parents andgiven to foster parents. Later they were taken from the foster parents by DenverSocial Services after the husband was murdered in very strange circumstances andthey were given to a single woman who had turned up out of nowhere after themurder and offered to be a nanny to the children. The Satanic ring centred inDenver connects into Boulder, Colorado and this was where the child beautyqueen, JonBenet Ramsey, was found murdered in her parents home in verymysterious and unexplained circumstances in December 1996. The American coronerand investigator, Dr Cyril Wecht, says that the evidence proves that her deathhappened during sexual abuse by her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.43[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128754] Personally, from what I haveheard, I would like to know what Bill Clinton was doing that night. JonBenet wasmurdered on Christmas Eve and Josef Mengele created a sacrificial ritual forthis date called “The Last Bulb on the Christmas Tree”. Mengele’s pseudonym,Greenbaum, means green tree and relates to the Cabalistic Tree of Life. ABrotherhood term for the Devil is JonBet and the coincidence is so amazing that,given the other circumstances, I cannot believe that this was not the trueinspiration for her name.A research project into ritual abuse at the University of Colorado at Boulderfound that all of those questioned had been subjected to intercourse ormolestation; 97% saw or took part in animal sacrifice; 97% forced to take partin sex with adults; 97% experienced torture; 94% were sodomised; 88% were forcedto watch or take part in human sacrifice; 88% in cannibalism. A long, long listof child and other murders across the world are the work of Satanic groups,including, I would strongly contend, the still unexplained murder of 13-year-oldGenette Tate near Exeter in Devon in 1978. Her body has never been found. I havemet with people who have been investigating this case for many years and theevidence is overwhelming that it involved a Satanic group which could well haveincluded some leading personnel at the Devon and Cornwall police headquarters, ashort distance from where Genette was last seen alive. Her father, John Tate,also has some significant questions to answer. A manuscript exists of thisevidence if there is a publisher out there who is interested in exposing thecase. When sceptics ask how such widespread Satanism, abuse and murder can becovered up, they need to appreciate the sort of people who are involved in theserings. David Berkowitz, the serial killer in New York known as the Son of Sam,has written that he was part of a Satanic group which had orchestrated themurders. In letters to a church minister, Berkowitz said:“…this group contained a mixture of Satanic practices, including the teachingsof Aleister Crowley and Eliphas Levi (another notorious Satanist). It was (andstill is) totally blood orientated… The coven’s doctrines are a blend of ancientDruidism, teachings of the secret order of the Golden Dawn, black magick, and ahost of other unlawful and obnoxious practices…“… Satanists (genuine ones) are peculiar people. They aren’t ignorant peasantsor semi-literate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors, lawyers,businessmen, and basically highly responsible citizens… They are not a carelessgroup who are apt to make mistakes. But they are secretive and bonded togetherby a common need and desire to mete out havoc on society. It was AleisterCrowley who said: “I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything bad.”44[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1128965]Satanism is the creation of the reptilians, the ‘fallen angels’, andinterestingly they also had a son of Sam according to a one thousand-year-oldaccount. The Arab poet, Firdowsi, completed his legendary history of Iran in1010 AD, a work called the Shahnameh or Book of Kings. He writes about a kingcalled Sam who married a beautiful woman who gave birth to a baby of unearthlyappearance. The description of the baby’s features is exactly the same as thechildren born of the interbreeding between the Watchers and human women – verylarge, white skinned, and hair like snow. His name was Zal, a Nefilim child, aWatcher (reptilian) – human hybrid. And Zal was the son of Sam. In 1969, CharlesManson and his Satanic ‘Family’ murdered nine people, including the actressSharon Tate. Manson operated in California in the Flower Power years when agroup called the Process had a high profile in cities like San Francisco. TheProcess emerged in Britain and then established branches in California and NewYork. The group celebrates Adolf Hitler and worships a Trinity of Jehovah,Lucifer, and Satan. In the British occult magazine, The Lamp Of Thoth, a writerby the name of Soror H, said of Charles Manson: “(He) showed many of us what itis like to actually commit the crime we’d like to commit… Manson went astraywhere others like the Process succeeded. He got caught.”45[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1129088] Another serial killer, Henry LeeLucas, who is said to have murdered 360 people, including his mother, claimed hewas a member of the Hand of Death Satanic group. He said that murder was part ofthe initiation and he admitted to drinking the blood of some of his victims. TheHand of Death, he said, was involved in drug running and the kidnapping ofchildren for slavery and sacrifice. When they were killed, the group would drinktheir blood and eat part of their body, Lucas said. Mutilated bodies were foundin Mexico and Arizona which appeared to support his story. Richard Ramirez, theserial killer known as the Knight Stalker, said he killed his thirteen victimsin the name of Satan. Inverted pentagrams, the classic Satanic symbol, werefound spray painted in the homes of several of his victims and he carved apentagram on the thigh of an elderly woman.The number of murders world-wide involving Satanic ritual is simply fantastic.While I was writing this book I heard from another researcher of the ritualmurder of Alfred Kunz, a rebel Roman Catholic priest who performed exorcisms. Hewas found in March 1998 in his rectory at Madison, Wisconsin, hanging upsidedown with his throat cut from ear to ear. His head had then been cut off and hisblood taken away. Such were the circumstances in the case that the FBI wascalled in to investigate. The assassinations of President Kennedy and PrincessDiana were full of Satanic ritual, also, as I shall outline later. I hear thesame themes of Satanic ritual, abuse and sacrifice in every country I visit andeven on the Isle of Wight, the small island off the south coast of England whereI have lived for many years, there is substantial Satanic activity. Britain’sbiggest selling Sunday tabloid, The News Of The World, published the revelationsof a community worker on the Isle of Wight who exposed the nature and extent ofthe abuse there. She said that these Satanic sacrificers of children werepillars of the local community, owners of seaside hotels, business people, localgovernment officers, and politicians. She described the breeding programmes onthe island in which babies are bred for sacrifice and how it connected into thepaedophile and drug smuggling rings, another common theme. Detective ChiefInspector Neil Kingman, who was heading the inquiry, said: “ I have met thecommunity worker several times and interviewed other people regarding thismatter. I have no reason to doubt what I am being told.”46[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1129179]There have been many famous cases in which ritual abuse has been alleged, butthese have been successfully covered up by the political and judicialauthorities and a compliant, uninformed, and slanted media. In the UnitedStates, the McMartin case in Los Angeles which came to light in 1983 was a primeexample. It involved allegations by 369 children at the McMartin Day Care Centrethat they had been sexually abused. They told of animals being slaughtered andother Satanic rituals. They described how they were buried, locked in the dark,and taken to different locations to be abused. These included a grocery store, acemetery, a church, and a crematorium. The children said they were forced todrink blood and urine and they saw the eyes of a baby ripped out and its bodyincinerated. Others said that a rabbit was killed in front of them to show whatwould happen if they told their parents. The case was under investigation forfour years, on trial for two and a half years, involved 124 witnesses, 50,000pages of transcript, and cost almost $23,000 a day. But in the end it fell apartand those responsible escaped with their freedom. Crucial to the children’sstories was their description of a network of secret tunnels under the buildingthrough which they said they were taken to be abused. It was claimed at thetrial that there was no evidence that these tunnels existed, but five monthsafter the files were closed on the McMartin case and the official cover upcompleted, a team of trained investigators and excavators uncovered the tunnelsystem which connected to a vaulted room under the day care centre. Theyextended out to adjacent buildings where the children said they had been takenbefore they were driven to other locations. In 1991, an independentarchaeologist also confirmed the existence of the tunnels and an alarm systeminside the centre. In other words, the children had been telling the truth. InBritain there have been, among many others, cases in Orkney, Nottingham,Rochdale and Cleveland. Each time the social workers trying to expose Satanicabuse have been subjected to a blitz of condemnation by the mainstream mediawith the Mail On Sunday particularly vehement in its opposition. It went so faron one occasion as to describe the “spectre” of Satanism as “hystericalnonsense”. Such remarks are so at odds with worldwide evidence that they canonly be the work of an uninformed idiot (quite possible) or someone who wishesthe truth to remain uncovered. As a result of such imbalanced coverage and, ofcourse, the staggering nature of the children’s evidence, most cases do not evencome to trial and when they do very few lead to conviction. The public wouldrather believe the allegations are not true because they want to believe suchhorrors are not happening. Unfortunately they are, on a vast scale, and if yougo into denial about it because you don’t want to face the truth about yourworld, then you are helping to perpetuate this unspeakable treatment ofchildren. As Caroline Lekiar of the National Association of Young People inCare, said:“I can understand people finding it difficult to believe, it’s extraordinary,but yet, everything is showing that it is happening. Young kids are drawingpictures of the type of thing that don’t come on TV. I’ve been dealing with thisfor the last two years, I’ve come across many cases of ritualistic abuse and alot of it happens all over the place; people have really got to wake up.”47[../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1129315]Satanic ritual abuse is a global network, another pyramid of interconnectinggroups, with the high and mighty of society among their numbers, toppoliticians, government officials, bankers, business leaders, lawyers, judges,doctors, coroners, publishers, editors and journalists. All the people you need,in fact, to carry out and cover up your rituals and crimes against humanity. Itis not that researchers see Satanists everywhere. The ratio of them in leadingpositions is very high because that’s the way it is meant to be. The Satanicnetworks control the system and so they ensure that there is a far, far, higherratio of Satanists in positions of power than there are in the generalpopulation. The higher you go up the pyramids, the more Satanists you find. Mostof the non-Satanists are filtered out before they reach those levels. The resultof all this for the children involved is beyond the imagination of anyone whohas not experienced the level of trauma that they must suffer. The singer, JoanBaez, sings a song about recalling childhood abuse as the amnesiac barriersbegin to fall, the mind control breaks down, and the memories come flashingback. The words capture the feelings of such people magnificently:You don’t have to play me backwards,To get the meaning of my verse,You don’t have to die and go to hell,To feel the Devil’s curse.Well I thought my life was a photograph,On the family Christmas card.Kids all dressed in buttons and bows,And lined up in the yard.Were the golden days of childhood,So lyrical and warm?Or did the picture start to fade,On the day that I was born.Let the night begin, there’s a pop of skin,And the sudden rush of scarlet,There’s a little boy riding on a goat’s head,And a little girl playing the harlot.There’s a sacrifice in an empty church,Of sweet li’l baby Rose,And a man in a mask from Mexico,Is peeling off my clothes.I’ve seen them light the candles,I’ve heard them beat the drum,And I’ve cried Mama, Mama, I’m cold as ice,And I’ve got no place to run.So I’m paying for protection,Smoking out the truth,Chasing recollections,Nailing down the proof.I’ll stand before your altar,And tell everything I know,I’ve come to claim my childhood,At the chapel of baby Rose.48 [../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1129434]What an horrific experience this verbalises and many thousands of children willgo through that same nightmare all over the world today and every day. Doesanyone still believe that we should walk away and ignore it? That we should kidourselves that it is not happening. Or is this get-off-your-arse time? A time tomake a difference."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1052168] Nigel Davies, Human Sacrifice,In History And Today (William Morrow and Company, New York), p 46.2 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1052954] Ibid, p 21.3 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1053303] Human Sacrifice, In History AndToday p 22.4 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1054787] Ibid, pp 53, 56, 57.5 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1055679] Ibid, p 51.6 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1055921] Ibid, p 33.7 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1056336] The Illuminati Formula, p 46.8 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1057078] The Curse Of Canaan, p 67.9 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1058985] Waco: The Rules Of Engagement(Fifth Estate Productions, distributed by Somford Entertainment, Los Angeles,CA, USA).10 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1059858] Andrew Boyd, BlasphemousRumours (Fount Paperbacks, an imprint of Harper Collins, London, 1991), p 142.This is a very balanced and first class investigation into the subject and Ichallenge anyone to read this and still deny that Satanic ritual abuse is amyth.11 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1061714] Human Sacrifice, p 64.12 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1066033] Aleister Crowley, Magick TheoryAnd Practice (Dover, USA, 1929), pp 94-95.13 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1070908] The Templar Revelation, p 109.14 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1071241] The Occult Conspiracy, pp39-40.15 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1071421] The Temple And The Lodge, p 53.16 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1072489] The Hiram Key, p 364.17 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1073026] The Curse Of Canaan, p 37.18 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1073198] Ibid.19 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1073386] Ibid.20 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1073683] Ibid.21 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1074056] Ibid, p 38.22 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1074519] Blasphemous Rumours, p 114.23 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1074686] Ibid.24 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1075292] The Illuminati Formula, p 46.25 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1075509] Ibid.26 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1075736] The Top 13 IlluminatiBloodlines.27 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1077350] Ibid, p 93.28 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1077821] The Illuminati Formula, p 213.29 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1078193] Ibid.30 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1078338] Ibid.31 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1078906] Ibid, p 214.32 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1081215] \"Satanic Links to BelgianMurder Trial”, The Sunday Times, December 29th 1996.33 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1081672] Ibid.34 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1082170] Ibid.35 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1089739] \"Lord McAlpine and thePaedophile Ring”, Scallywag, issue 22, 1994.36 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1091017] Peter Jones, The Obedience OfAustralia (XPO-imprint, 26 Burlington Close, London, W9 3LZ, 1995) , pp 10-11.37 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1091790] Extraterrestrial Friends AndFoes, p 70.38 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1092209] Ibid, p 69.39 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1093737] \"The Monster Man of PIE”,Scallywag, issue 25, 1994.40 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1094983] Contact newspaper, April 4th1995, p 23.41 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1107560] The Illuminati Formula, p 22.42 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1107833] Ibid.43 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1109321] National Enquirer, April 28th1998, p 39, quoting a proposed book by Dr Wecht called Who Killed JonBenetRamsey44 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1112397] Quoted in Blasphemous Rumours,p 212.45 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1113932] Ibid, p 183.46 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1116564] The News Of The World, August24th 1997, pp 30-31.47 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1120265] Quoted Blasphemous Rumours, p30.48 [../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos1123168] Written by Joan Baez, WallyWilson, Kenny Greenberg and Karen O'Connor, published by Gabriel Earl Music/SonyCross Keys Publishing Company/Greenberg Music."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos8483]Where have all the children gone? [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos8483]The Satanic networks are a vital part of the global mind control programmesdesigned to create a race of mindless zombies and an endless flow of mindcontrolled assassins, crazed gunmen, and agents provocateur. Human robots – mindcontrolled slaves – have been with us for thousands of years and it is anepidemic today. As Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler say in their detailedinvestigation into mind control:“The basic techniques were developed in German, Scottish, Italian, and Englishfamilies and have been done for centuries. Some report that techniques go backto ancient Egypt and ancient Babylon to the ancient mystery religions. The Nazisare known to have studied ancient Egyptian texts in their mind control research.The records and secrets of the generational bloodlines are very well guardedsecrets.”1 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1264951]Control of the human mind and emotions is the very foundation of the reptiliancontrol of the human race. Control a person’s mind and you control them. Theexternal manipulation of the mind takes many forms and the question is not howmany are mind controlled, but how few are not. Every time you allow a newspaper,news programme, or manipulating advertisement to affect your perceptions anddecisions, you are being mind controlled. The emergence of today’s vast networkof mind control centres and operations can be traced back to the British Army’sDirectorate of Psychological Warfare commanded by Brigadier General JohnRawlings Rees. This interlocked with the Tavistock Clinic which was founded in1920 under the direct support of the British royal family through the Duke ofKent. Later came the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London and thisis the centre of a global web which includes the Stanford Institute in theUnited States. The aim of these organisations is the control of humanity via theexternal manipulation of the mind. Rawlings Rees was a vehement racist andsupporter of the eugenics ‘master race’ movement. He studied ‘war neuroses’during World War I and he believed that by using the right conditions neuroticbehaviour could be stimulated and controlled. He wrote in his book, The ShapingOf Psychiatry By War, published in 1945, that the Tavistock Group haddemonstrated during the Second World War that there was a ‘psychopathologicaltenth’ of the population who were genetically stupid. The numbers of thesepeople had to be controlled, he said, to protect civilised society and it wasnecessary to take steps, including the use of psychiatry, to prevent theirincrease in numbers – especially in the backward colonial countries whichthreatened the civilised world. This was the usual reptilian-Aryan bullshit andHenry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, and Adolf Hitler, could not have put itbetter. Rawlings Rees said there was another ten per cent of the populationwhose genetic superiority and psychological training made them suitable tooccupy the seats of power (the reptilians and their crossbreeds). The othereighty per cent between these two extremes could, he suggested, be usefulservants to the genetic élite if their neuroses could be controlled. RawlingsRees wanted to see psychiatrists involved throughout society, in the home, atwork, and in schools, and he arranged for the Tavistock group to train what hecalled the ‘shock troops’, the psychiatrists posing as ‘advisors’ to thebusiness, military, political, and educational management. Their job was, andis, to shape the way people think in the educational, political and businesssectors and therefore control the direction of the world. I was told by a memberof the House of Lords in Britain that Dr David Owen, now Lord Owen (Bil, TC),the British Foreign Secretary in the 1970s, founder of the Social DemocraticParty, and peace negotiator for the European Union in Bosnia, was trained atTavistock, but I have not yet been able to confirm this or otherwise at the timeof writing.In 1947, Rawlings Rees took his ‘vision’ to the United Nations and formed theWorld Federation of Mental Health with Montegu Norman, the Governor of the Bankof England who had funded and manipulated Adolf Hitler and the Nazis to power.As usual, dozens of affiliated, and centrally controlled organisations with anidentical agenda were formed around the world. In each country these groupstargeted people for mind manipulation that ensured their unquestioning serviceto the Brotherhood Agenda. Many of these people became the leaders of the ThirdWorld countries which, on the surface, were winning their ‘independence’. Intruth they continued to be controlled by the same people as before. Runningalongside this was the United Nations Social and Cultural Organisation under theleadership of another Brotherhood mind programmer, Julian Huxley. The late DrFred Wills, the Foreign Minister of Guyana, summed up the situation brilliantlywhen he said the United Nations was the world’s largest, continuously-run,brainwashing programme for leaders of developing countries. The same applies tothe leaders of the industrial countries too, who also have their minds playedwith before they are allowed to enter the positions of political and economicpower. Rawlings Rees’s protege, Eric Trist, was involved in a Tavistock projectto ‘restructure’ the thinking of business management. This plan includedbreaking the power of the trades union movement and manipulating the thinking oftop management. Among the corporations who hired Tavistock to do this wereShell, Unilever, the coal industry (then government owned), and a number of theleading financial institutions. Major corporations today use ‘psychologists’ andthey employ ‘facilitators’ or ‘group leaders’ to run business meetings. What arethey really there for? And who are they working for? This all fits into theTavistock plan to have ‘psychiatrists’ at every level of society hiding behindother job descriptions. Tavistock was behind the drug culture of the 1960s andthe hippie movement and it was they who controlled the purveyors of the ‘tunein, drop out’ philosophy. This was underpinned by the Brotherhood-CIA operationwhich made the drug LSD widely available. They are constantly in search of morepowerful techniques to imprison the human race in complete servitude. AldousHuxley, a Tavistock agent, and guru of the 60s ‘revolution’, revealed the agendaat a lecture to the California Medical School in San Francisco in 1961. He said:“There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of makingpeople love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears so tospeak. Producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies sothat people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but willrather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel – bypropaganda, or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacologicalmethods. And this seems to be the final revolution.”We are at that very point today. The work of John Rawlings Rees was continued byother Tavistock operatives such as Dr Kurt Lewin as Tavistock developed evermore sophisticated techniques for the individual and mass control of the humanmind. These have increased the speed at which humanity has become unthinking androbotic. Tavistock became the centre of a global network as unlimited funds weremade available through ‘charity’ trusts sponsored by the British royal familyand from familiar sources like the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Mellons,and the Morgans. Tavistock created ‘terrorist’ groups are used to createconflict and turmoil in countries where the Brotherhood want to change thegovernment or justify the imposition of ‘peace-keeping’ troops. In the 1950s,Brigadier General Frank Kitson commanded a Tavistock project which used mindcontrol and torture techniques on prisoners in British prisoner of war camps inKenya. These robots were then released to penetrate groups opposing Britishcontrol, destroy them from the inside, and kill their leaders. Others formedtheir own groups to fight the genuine ones and so Kenyan was fighting Kenyan.This is why the SAS are operating in Africa and South America today under thecover of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the ‘security’ organisations, as Ishall document. This has happened in Algeria, Rwanda, Burundi, the Congo, thelist seems endless. The same Brigadier General Frank Kitson who created suchconflict and terror in Africa was sent to Northern Ireland in 1970 to launch theinitial bombing and murder campaign which triggered the Northern Irelandconflict that still continues today. Such conflicts all over the world lead todemands that something must be done and that ‘something’ is always furthercentralisation of power. It is not surprising to learn, therefore, that EricTrist launched the Tavistock operation in the 1980s designed to use its enormousinternational network to programme the collective psyche to accept a worldgovernment.In 1991, the Tavistock journal, Human Relations, reported on the worldgovernment project. The collapse of the Soviet Union (orchestrated by theBrotherhood) had created great opportunities for world government and the end ofthe nation state, the report said. It proposed a reformation of the UnitedNations to hand over all operations to a network of hundreds of thousands of(centrally controlled) ‘non-governmental organisations’. These would operateacross national borders and not be subject to any control by electedgovernments. All this is a systematic plan to impose the will of the reptilianson the collective human mind and it has constantly gathered pace since the1950s. After the Second World War the Brotherhood emphasis changed from controlof territory to control of minds and finances. People will eventually rebelagainst occupation of their land, but it’s very much more difficult to identify,and therefore resist, occupation of their minds and their financial choices.Winston Churchill told an audience at Harvard University on September 6th 1943,that to control what men think offered far better prizes than taking away otherpeople’s lands or provinces or grinding them down in exploitation. The empiresof the future, he said, would be the empires of the mind. Lord Bertrand Russellsaid in his 1957 book, The Impact Of Science Upon Society, that when thetechniques of mind control had been perfected, every government that was incharge of education for more than one generation would be able to control itssubjects securely without any need for armies or policemen. That is what‘education’ is doing to our children today.Along with the British Psychological Warfare Department and the Tavistockoperation, research also expanded rapidly under the fascists in Germany andItaly. Josef Mengele, ‘the Angel of Death’, conducted mind control experimentson thousands of twins under the supervision of Heinrich Himmler at the KaiserWilhelm Medical Institute in Berlin. Mengele was born into a rich Satanicreptilian bloodline. He was an expert in demonology and the Cabala and was atleast a Grand Master in the Illuminati, though probably much higher.2[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265064] As the camp ‘doctor’ at theAuchwitz Concentration Camp run by I. G. Farben, he was able to experiment oncountless thousands of inmates. When the Allied armies were closing in onGermany in 1945 the British-United States Intelligence operation called ProjectPaperclip was launched to allow Mengele and the Elite Nazi leadership,‘scientists’, ‘doctors’, and military personnel to escape. Mengele disappearedfrom Auchwitz in January 1945, and the public were led to believe he had escapedto South America. In fact, he travelled world-wide, working at both theTavistock Institute in London and in the United States where he was known as Dr.Green or Greenbaum.3 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265159] The officialrecords in Germany detailing Mengele’s mind control research were taken by theAmericans at the end of the war and the millions of sheets of paper involved arestill stored in the Suitland Annex in Washington DC where they are kept understrict security. Most of Mengele’s research gleaned in the concentration campsis still classified.4 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265249] ResearcherFritz Springmeier established the names of a number of people who had securityclearance to access these files and every one was connected to the Brotherhoodnetworks, including the Illuminati. Many other documents have been destroyed andin the bowels of the CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia, just across theriver from Washington DC, is a basement area known as the Pit where documentsare shredded around the clock.5 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265337]Mind control survivors from this period recall Mengele’s spotless uniform andshiny boots which he wore during programming sessions. They remember his thickGerman accent, the space between his front teeth, and the way he jabbed with histhumb.6 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265420] As in the concentrationcamps of Germany, he often had German shepherd dogs to frighten children in hisprogramming sessions. Coordinating Project Paperclip and the subsequent mindcontrol programmes in the United States were the Dulles brothers, cousins to theRockefellers, both Satanists, reptilians, and Nazis to their core. John FosterDulles became the US Secretary of State after the war while his brother AllenDulles was appointed to head the new Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Fromthis influx of Nazi mind-doctors into the United States came the now notoriousand unspeakable mind control programmes known as MKUltra. MK stands for mindcontrol; they used the German spelling of kontrolle in deference to the GermanNazis who inspired the methods and techniques. It was headed, officially, byEwen Cameron, an extremely sick individual, and a member of one of the EliteScottish reptilian bloodlines. His favourite book as a child was Frankensteinwhich, he said, inspired him to follow a career in psychiatry. From his base inMontreal, Canada, he coordinated the infamous MKUltra mind control operationwith funding from familiar names like the Rockefellers and he had regularmeetings with Allen Dulles and the CIA. One of Cameron’s institutionsadministered 60,000 electrical shocks to patients in one year alone: 1961.Cameron’s code name was ‘Dr White’ and indeed colour was part of his research.He was trying to discover how to make brown eyes blue. Can it really be acoincidence that the country singer, Crystal Gayle, who is reported to be a mindcontrolled slave,7 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265509] made a hitrecord called Don’t It Make Your Brown Eyes Blue?Many of the rituals and methods employed in the mind control projects areinspired by the ancient mystery schools. Admiral Stanfield Turner, the Directorof the CIA, admitted publicly in 1977 that millions of dollars had been spentstudying voodoo, witchcraft and psychics, and at the Senate hearing on August3rd 1977, he said that the CIA had been mind controlling countless peoplewithout their consent or knowledge. MKUltra had involved at least 185scientists, 80 US institutions, among them prisons, pharmaceutical companies,hospitals, and 44 medical colleges and universities. Some 700 drugs are used bythe Babylonian Brotherhood’s mad professors in their mind control projects tocreate their human robots. This is why so many drugs were found at the JonestownCompound in Guyana in 1978 when ‘cult’ members were murdered in their hundreds.The People’s Temple ‘cult’ was created by CIA operative, Jim Jones. It was not anew religion as portrayed in the media, it was a mind control experiment. Seethe chapter Cult or Con in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free. Drugs have beenused since ancient times to mind manipulate people and take them into alteredstates of consciousness. They can also suppress the will and allow what iscalled ‘demonic possession’. The CIA-British Intelligence networks fund drugresearch (in other words the public do) to find more and more effective ways ofsuppressing consciousness and will. This includes vaccinations, food additives,and electromagnetic techniques. One of the centres involved in drug research forthe CIA is the California Medical Facility at Vacaville where the work was doneby Dr Arthur Nugent. Countless experiments have been carried out and continue tobe so. They include the use of mind controlling drugs on servicemen at theBethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland (since exposed in a television documentary).One of the experiments is in Haiti where the Vodoun cult, a CIA-front, hasturned most of the people into little more than zombies.Prozac is a drug that constantly appears in research into these matters and itis not confined to individual mind control projects, it is being issued likeconfetti by doctors who serve the profits and ambitions of the drug cartelinstead of their patient’s wellbeing. It is one of the world’s most prescribeddrugs for depression and, as I write, Eli Lilly is seeking approval to market aversion of Prozac for children in peppermint and orange flavours. Already some400,000 youngsters under 18 are being treated with Prozac in the United Statesalone and that is just the start. This is a mass mind control operation we areseeing here, creating a race of zombies like the ones in Haiti. Eli Lilly isclosely connected to the Morgan and Rockefeller networks, US Intelligence, andGeorge Bush. Other pharmaceutical companies involved in drug research for themind control projects include: Sterling Drug (a spin-off from Hitler’s I. G.Farben) which is connected to the bloodline family, the Krupps, the CIA’s TinkerFoundation, and the Order of St John of Jerusalem; and Monsanto Chemical Companywhere the president Earle H. Harbison Jr is also president of the Mental HealthAssociation and director of the infamous Bethesda General Hospital where slavesare programmed for a mind control operation called Project Monarch.8[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265599] Monsanto is heavily involved withgenetically manipulated food.Trauma-based mind controlProject Monarch is one of the many offshoots of MKUltra, a programme which,despite official denials, is not only continuing today under other names, it hasmassively expanded. The foundation of these projects world-wide is a techniquecalled trauma-based mind control and now we can see how the Satanic networks fitinto this picture. The mind has a defence mechanism which compartmentalises thememory of extreme trauma. This is why people cannot remember serious roadaccidents. Their mind creates an amnesiac barrier around the event so they don’thave to keep reliving such horrible memories. From ancient times this has beenunderstood by the Brotherhood. In the concentration camps of Nazi Germany themethods of exploiting this phenomena for mind control were further perfected.Mengele and the Nazis realised that if you could systematically traumatisesomeone through torture, sexual abuse, and by sacrificing and torturing othersas they watched, you could shatter a person’s mind into a honeycomb ofself-contained compartments or amnesiac barriers. Satanic rituals are widelyused to do this. Once the mind’s unity has been shattered, these variouscompartments, each unaware of the other’s existence, can be programmed forvarious tasks or experiences. Using trigger words and hypnotic keys, sounds, orsignals, these compartments can be pulled forward and pushed back like a mentalfiling cabinet. One self contained compartment or fragment of mind becomes theperson’s conscious level and it is then returned to the subconscious and anothercompartment accessed. This means that after the victim has performed a task theyforget what they have done and who with. This condition has become known asMultiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Thelatter is more accurate because the compartments are not ‘personalities’ assuch, they are fragments of mind which have disassociated, become detached from,the rest of the consciousness. It is like moving a radio dial across thestations, the compartments, tuning into one and then another. Even thistechnique is primitive compared with the latest methods. I knew from my researchthat there is an obsession among Satanists and paedophiles with having anal sexwith young girls, as well as boys, and the British therapist, Vera Diamond, toldme that this is a way of creating multiples. Anal penetration is so painful to achild that it sends a surge of energy up the spine which explodes in the brain,causing further ‘personality’ splitting. It is called vaso-vagal shock. Sheshowed me a painting by a female victim of this and it portrayed a surge ofwhite energy rising from the bottom of the spine and exploding in all directionsin her head. So even anal sex has an ulterior motive for those who understandits mental and emotional effect.Most people are MPD or ‘multiples’ to an extent because we are all shutting outwhat we would rather not face, but we are talking here about an extreme andcalculated version of it. Many soldiers become multiples when they witnessunimaginable slaughter, as their mind walls off the memory and they have norecollection of what they saw. Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich, a professor atTubingen University in Germany, wrote a classic study of Multiple PersonalityDisorder and ‘demonic possession’ in 1921 called Possession, Demonical AndOther. This revealed that trauma-based mind control was being used in France,Germany and Belgium long before the dawn of the 20th century. Survivors andprofessionals have told of how the British used agents programmed through MPD inthe First World War.9 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265688] Although thetrauma may be forgotten, subconsciously it is still affecting them and theirlives, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Many people who are sexuallyabused and systematically traumatised as children appear mentally and physicallyunstable, especially if the programming has stopped and the compartment wallsbegin to dismantle. I have sat in on sessions with the British therapist, VeraDiamond, and seen people switch between vastly different ‘personalities’, oneafter the other, by the use of a single word or sentence. It is incredible toexperience. One of her clients has to be attached to a plastic bag whichcollects her urine because her bladder has been destroyed by torture. Hermedical records are so enormous it shocked a doctor who saw them. When I mether, this lady was just 30… 30… years of age. In the UK the psychologists,social workers, and police, glean their knowledge of Multiple PersonalityDisorder from the Tavistock group which claims to be the authority on treatingthe problem while secretly using it to programme people. Dr William Sargant, apsychiatrist at the Tavistock Institute, wrote in his 1957 book, Battle For TheMind:“Various types of belief can be implanted in many people after brain functionhas been deliberately disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear,anger or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturbances, the most commonone is temporarily impaired judgement and heightened suggestibility. Its variousgroup manifestations are sometimes classed under the heading of “herd instinct”,and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe epidemics, and in allsimilar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety and so individual andmass suggestibility.”There you have another reason why the public are fed a constant diet of eventswhich induce fear, anger or excitement. Once again, the knowledge of this is notnew, it is just more widely used and focused today. People, or rather zombies,in a programmed state are used for many things. They are activated to carry outassassinations, as with the killers of John Lennon and Robert Kennedy. SirhanSirhan, the mind controlled puppet alleged to have murdered Robert Kennedy in1968, was on a ‘mind expansion’ course with the Rosicrucians when he began tohear messages telling him to kill Kennedy. I detail the background to this in…And The Truth Shall Set You Free. We can now see why so many assassinations areperformed by people with the same mental profile – the so-called ‘lone nutters’.They are neither alone nor, in most cases, insane if they were allowed to livein their natural state. They are programmed people, often since childhood. Bythis method, you can use these mind controlled robots to plant a terrorist bomband then ensure they are in the right place at the right time to be accused andcharged with the outrage. You can also program that person’s mind while incustody to make sure that he even thinks he was involved. The infamous CIA mindcontroller called Dr Louis Jolyon ‘Jolly’ West, who features strongly in …AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free, gave a ‘mental examination’ to Timothy McVeigh,the microchipped former US soldier who was convicted of the Oklahoma bombing.West was deeply involved in MKUltra and one of his keenest supporters was thethen Governor of California, later President of the United States, RonaldReagan.We have seen a spate of ‘lone nutters’ in many countries who commit mass murderby going apparently crazy with guns. In the United Kingdom we have hadhorrendous examples of this in the little towns of Hungerford in Berkshire in1987 and Dunblane in Scotland on March 13th 1996. A ‘nutter’ called ThomasHamilton walked into a school in Dunblane and opened fire on little children ina gymnasium. He killed 16 five and six year olds and a teacher. The effect onthe collective psyche of hundreds of millions of people across the world,especially of course, in the UK, was devastating. Shortly after that came themassacre in Port Arthur, a small town in Tasmania, Australia, when another lonegunman called Martin Bryant went ‘crazy’ on April 28th 1996 and killed 35people. This was followed in England by a guy attacking children and theirteachers with a machete at a school in Wolverhampton. In March 1998 came‘America’s Dunblane’ when two youngsters, Mitchell Johnson aged 13, and hiscousin, 11-year-old Andrew Golden, opened fire on their school friends andteachers at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro in Arkansas, just 130 milesfrom Bill Clinton’s political base at Little Rock. 27 shots were fired killingfour students and a teacher and wounding eleven others. In 1999 came theColumbine High School shootings in Colorado in which 13 students were shot dead.Often reports emerge after these events that some of the killers were involvedin Satanism. Similar incidents happened in Pearl, Mississippi, on October 1st1997, and in December the same year at West Paducah, Kentucky, and Stamps,Arkansas. Again, it was claimed that those involved in Pearl had been takingpart in Satanism. There have been many more since. These events have all thehallmarks of mind control operations. So what goes on here?Look at the profiles of many of these people. Most have a background of being abit strange, troubled or simple – “Not the full quid”, as neighbours describedthe Port Arthur killer, Martin Bryant. This is perfect when you want them andtheir horrors to be dismissed as the work of a lone nutter. In Bryant’s case, hehad apparently just returned from a two week stay in the United States when hewent berserk with his gun. People close to him said his character had changedafter he came back from the US, although he had a long history of psychiatricproblems and Bryant was a creation of the global mind control centre atTavistock in London. He was ‘examined’ in 1983–84 by Tavistock’s Dr EricCunningham Dax, who decided on his future ‘treatment’. Dax was for decades aclose associate of Dr John Rawlings Rees, the inspiration for the Tavistockbrainwashing operation. It has been shown that terrorist groups like the IRAhave what they call ‘sleepers’, people who lie low unused for years, evendecades, until circumstances occur in which they and their cover can beexploited for a particular task. It is the same in this world of mind control.There are people programmed to live in the community with a certain characterprofile until the time comes when they can be used. They are known in the‘trade’ as ‘dead eyes’. They have no idea that they are being used in this waybecause they are not in control of their minds, their programmers are. There areso many unanswered questions, interestingly, about why the Dunblane killer, theFreemason Thomas Hamilton, was allowed to legally keep guns when his strangebehaviour should have ensured his licence was refused. And why did the police inPort Arthur take an hour to respond when the scene of the massacre was close tothe police station and they had been informed within minutes of Bryant’s firstshot? Also, Bryant, Hamilton, and so many other people who commit such outragesare reportedly taking Prozac. Side effects include nervousness, anxiety,suicidal tendencies, hypomania, and violent behaviour when the drug iswithdrawn. Doctors are warned not to prescribe Prozac to anyone with a historyof ‘mania’. A number of people involved in mass shootings in the United Stateshave been taking this drug. Traces of the active ingredient of Prozac were alsofound in the blood of Henri Paul, the driver of Princess Diana’s Mercedes whenit crashed in Paris in 1997.So what is the motivation behind these gun massacres? The manipulation of themind and emotions. Where did these mass murders take place? Not in the ganglandareas of London, Glasgow, Los Angeles, or Sydney, but in quiet littlecommunities where everyone felt perfectly safe. In the same way, the ‘McVeigh’bomb and the school shootings did not happen in New York or Washington, but inOklahoma. We would be advised not to underestimate the effect on the collectivepsyche in terms of fear and a desire for the authorities to ‘protect’ peoplefrom that fear. That means more cameras in the streets and more security guardsand cameras in schools so that children are brought up to accept the culture ofbeing ‘protected’ from danger by ‘Big Brother’ authority. A front page headlinein, I think, the London Daily Mail encompassed the very reaction themanipulators wanted to stimulate. It said after the Australia killings: “Isnowhere in the world safe anymore?” When these things happen in quietcommunities, it encourages even more powerfully the response of “My God, thiscould happen to me and my children – hey, we need protecting”. A traumatisedmind is far more susceptible to mind manipulation. The Brotherhood want toremove all guns from the general population in preparation for their final coupd’état. No-one wants to rid the world of weapons more than me, but we need toask about the motivation behind the immense pressure for gun laws inspired by…Hungerford, Dunblane, Tasmania, Oklahoma, etc, etc. Problem-reactionsolution.Getting hold of illegal weapons is so easy that gun laws would not stop anyonewho really wanted to kill. The gun used by Martin Bryant in Port Arthur wasstolen and he had no licence. Gun laws would not have stopped that, but thereason such laws are being introduced all over the world is to prevent thepopulation from defending themselves when the order goes out to round up thosewho are challenging the Agenda. In the UK the distraught parents who lostchildren in Dunblane were sickeningly and callously used to spearhead anti-gunlegislation by the very people who orchestrated the murder of their loved ones.I don’t think I would use a gun, but who knows what a person would do in certaincircumstances? My instincts are that I don’t see the point of using violence tooppose violence, but many people would and the Brotherhood know that. For thisreason they want an unarmed population. Adolf Hitler introduced gun laws shortlybefore he began to transport people to his concentration camps. Similar camps,or ‘holding facilities’, have already been built in the United States by anorganisation called FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was setup by Zbigniew Brzezinski, a shape-shifting reptilian, and the man who launchedthe Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller. FEMA is headed by James LeeWitt and I would advise you to take a look at his eyes if you get the chance ontelevision and ask yourself what they remind you of.Mind controlled human robots are also used to pass messages between peopleoutside the normal channels. These include unofficial communications betweenworld leaders and between personnel within the Brotherhood-controlled illegaldrugs network which involves presidents of the United States and many otherworld leaders and officials. People programmed through Multiple PersonalityDisorder apparently develop a photographic memory. The words of thecommunication are dictated under a form of hypnosis and then compartmentalised,often using a high voltage stun gun which lowers blood sugar levels and makesthe person more open to suggestion. Later a trigger word, sentence, or action,activates that ‘personality’ compartment and the human robot repeats the messageword for word like a recorded tape. I have no doubt that many world leaders arethemselves under the influence of mind control by their handlers and I amconvinced that the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, with his distant eyes andfixed smile, is under some sort of mental influence. People look at some of thepeople I name and say: “But he seems such a nice chap, he’d never do that”. Thepoint to remember is that the minds of these people, including many primeministers and presidents, are compartmentalised and they can be switched fromone mode to another. They are not one personality, but multiples of them and weneed to appreciate this if we are going to follow the plot. Their closestfriends won’t realise that what they see is only one compartment of their mind.If they saw them switched to another compartment, they would not recognise themas the person they think they know. Mind controlled ‘multiples’ are also used toinfiltrate organisations the Brotherhood wish to discredit and destroy. Once onthe inside they are triggered to behave in ways that turn public opinion againstthe organisation.Mind controlled robots, including very small children, provide bizarre sex forpresidents, foreign leaders, politicians, and businessmen. Often this is done toencourage these leaders into the Brotherhood’s way of thinking or to compromiseand blackmail them into doing as they are told. When I say bizarre, I mean itand I don’t find the information that follows easy to write or speak about. Butit is so important that this veil is lifted, not least for those who are beingsubjected now, this minute, to some of this grotesque torture. For the mostobvious of reasons, these human robots are rarely able to talk about what hashappened to them. They are either in zombie mode and can’t remember, or, whenthey are past their sell by date from the Brotherhood’s perspective, they aremurdered and sometimes their body parts used for black magic rituals attended bysome very famous people. You think you know the personalities of people you seeon the television? Please read on. Fortunately, one very brave woman who wasmind controlled as a young child has spoken out after escaping from USgovernment slavery. She was taken through long and painful deprogrammingsessions lasting more than a year which dismantled compartments in her mind andallowed her to remember what happened to her – and who did it. She is CathyO’Brien, an American of Irish decent, who together with Mark Phillips, hasproduced a self-published book about her experiences called Trance Formation OfAmerica. 10 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1265776] It is a stunning talethat she has to tell, but there have been millions more like her (still are) andthat will continue to be the case until humanity wakes up to itsresponsibilities. Cathy describes in great detail the conversations she heard,the rooms and decor in the White House, the Pentagon, and top secret militaryestablishments across the US. She can also describe physical details of thepeople involved which she could only know if she had seen them naked. There area number of researchers who question some of the details in Trance Formation OfAmerica and, as always, I have many questions myself. But the themes and many ofthe names in Cathy’s book have come up again and again in the accounts of otherrecovering mind controlled slaves and in the research of myself and many others.Her story is a summary of what is happening all over the world so I will tell itat some length.Cathleen (Cathy) Ann O’Brien was born in 1957 in Muskegon, Michigan. Her fatherEarl O’Brien is a paedophile and one of Cathy’s first memories was being unableto breathe because his penis was in her mouth. Such trauma automaticallytriggers Multiple Personality Disorder without any need for programming becausethe child’s own mind wishes to shut out the horror. Her father’s friends werealso allowed to abuse and rape the young Cathy and her brothers, just as herfather and mother had been abused as children. Her mother was sexually abused byCathy’s grandfather, the leader of a Masonic Blue Lodge. Her mother’s brother,Uncle Bob to Cathy, was a pilot in Airforce Intelligence who claimed that heworked for the Vatican. Uncle Bob was also a commercial pornographer and Cathy’sfather forced her and her older brother, Bill, to take part in pornographicfilms made for the local Michigan Mafia which was connected, she says, to the‘porn king’ Gerald Ford, then a US representative. He would later be thevice-president of the United States under Richard Nixon and president when Nixonwas ousted by Henry Kissinger and company via Watergate. Ford also served on theWarren Commission ‘investigating’ the assassination of President Kennedy anddecided the official version was true even though it was impossible. While CathyO’Brien was a little child at school, she says she was raped by Gerald Ford inthe office of the Michigan State Senator, Guy VanderJagt, who also raped her.VanderJagt would become the chairman of the Republican Party NationalCongressional Committee which supported the child rapist and murderer, GeorgeBush, the Queen of England’s friend, in his successful campaign to becomePresident of the United States.Eventually, Cathy’s father was caught sending child pornography through the post– a film of young Cathy having sex with a boxer dog. To avoid prosecution, Cathywas handed over by her father to the United States Government and the DefenseIntelligence Agency. Her father was delighted with the deal because he was nowimmune from prosecution and could continue his pornography and paedophileactivities while the authorities looked the other way. The agency was searchingfor sexually abused children with Multiple Personality Disorder who came fromfamilies with a history of intergenerational child abuse. They wanted thechildren for their studies into genetic mind control which operated under thetitle, Project Monarch, an offshoot of MKUltra. The name Monarch comes from theMonarch butterfly, more symbolism which relates in part to the butterfly net.The man who arrived at Cathy’s house to give her father the ultimatum to “Handover your daughter or be prosecuted” was… Gerald Ford. Cathy’s father was sentto Harvard University near Boston to be instructed in how to prepare hisdaughter for the mad professors of the government agencies. Cathy says in herbook:“…in keeping with his government-provided instructions, my father began workingme like the legendary Cinderella. I shovelled fireplace ashes, hauled andstacked firewood, raked leaves, shovelled snow, chopped ice, and swept –‘because’, my father said, ‘Your little hands fit so nicely around the rake,mop, shovel, and broom handles…’ By this time my father’s exploitation of meincluded prostitution to his friends, local mobsters, and Masons, relatives,Satanists, strangers, and police officers…“…Government researchers involved in MKUltra Project Monarch knew about thephotographic memory aspect of MPD/DID, of course, as well as other resultant‘super-human’ characteristics. Visual acuity of an MPD/DID is 44 times greaterthan that of the average person. My developed unusually high pain threshold,plus compartmentalisation of memory, were “necessary” for military and covertoperation applications. Additionally, my sexuality was primitively twisted frominfancy. This programming was appealing and useful to perverse politicians whobelieved they could hide their actions deep within my memory compartments whichclinicians refer to as personalities.”11[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266053]All these methods of trauma, and others I will reveal, are not just gratuitoustorture. For example, heavy exercise with little sleep causes the overproductionof endorphins in the brain and this makes the person start to robotically reactto commands.12 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266143] This is part of thetraining methods in the military, of course, which is nothing more than a schoolfor mind control. The “Yes sir” mentally is pure mind control and subordinationto the will of another. Soldiers are not encouraged to think and question, onlyto do as they are told. You want to be mind controlled? OK, simple – join themilitary. The sexual theme of the programming and abuse is also inspired by themanipulation of sexual energy, the creative force, and at the point of orgasmthe mind psyche is wide open to access other higher or lower dimensions,depending on the state of being of those involved. These mind controlprogrammers have high-tech equipment which stimulate those parts of the brainwhich trigger the orgasm and so open the mind of the victim to the lower‘demonic’ dimensions, the reptilians. The programming techniques are highlysophisticated and often very subtle. One common Monarch technique is the ‘doublebind’ in which you say two opposites in the same sentence to cause confusion:“Don’t believe any of this, it’s all true” is an example.13[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266258] Slavery is not confined tohistory. Slavery is happening all over the world today, including, no,especially, in Britain, the United States, and other ‘civilised’ countries.Paedophiles make the news from time to time, but they are the tiniest tip of amassive network that goes right to the top (sorry, gutter) of ‘free’ societies.The truth about the abuse of boys at the Kincora Home in Northern Ireland wassuppressed because one of the abusers was an agent of British Intelligence. Italso involved at least one famous politician in Northern Ireland, but this facthas been covered up, not least by a now retired official of British Intelligencecalled Ian Cameron. Such child abuse networks provide the perfect vehicle tosatisfy the sexual desires of those in control and for blackmailing those theywish to control. I want to know the names of those involved in whatever countryyou live. If you know something, please tell me. The information will be in thestrictest confidence and if it can be substantiated I will make it public. Ifyou hesitate just think about the children being abused today, now, this minute.Cathy O’Brien says she was abused by Father James Thaylen when she soughtcomfort at a Roman Catholic Church called St Francis de Sales in Muskegon andanother priest, a Father Don, helped Gerald Ford’s friend, Guy VanderJagt, toconfuse and abuse her in line with the ‘requirements’ of Project Monarch. Latershe was sent to a Roman Catholic School, one of many used by the Brotherhood tosafely house their mind controlled children under the strict regime designed toincrease the depth of their Multiple Personality Disorder. Her school wasMuskegon Catholic Central High School where she was raped by Father Vesbit manytimes, on one occasion during a Satanic ritual involving other mind controlledboys and girls in his private chapel. The Roman Catholic Church is the epitomeof hypocrisy and deeply, deeply, sick. As this book has explained, it was thecreation of the Babylonian Brotherhood from the start, back at the time of theRoman Empire. The Roman Catholic Jesuit movement is an important vehicle for themanipulation of the global conspiracy. Like the Knights of Malta, who help tocontrol the Vatican, the Jesuit hierarchy does not even believe in Christianity!That’s just a front. The whole conspiracy is a lot of masks, mirrors andsmokescreens. The Jesuits, the Knights of Malta, and the Roman Catholichierarchy are part of the Babylonian Brotherhood. They were, and are, keensupporters of mind control outrages like Project Monarch and MKUltra. Howappropriate, given that the Roman Catholic Church has survived by terrifying,brainwashing, and mind controlling its global congregation. Cathy says she waspressured and manipulated from a young age by the CIA’s Roman Catholic branchinto keeping secrets through a technique known as the Rite to Remain Silent. Andthere were so many secrets to keep locked away in her compartmentalised mind.In the years that followed, she says she was under the control of the US‘Democrat’, the senator for West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd, and her abuse by himand the government agencies expanded. Byrd is a ‘constitutional’ expert workingto undermine and destroy the best parts of the American Constitution. She claimsthat Byrd controls a network of mind controlled slaves and loves nothing morethan to whip them mercilessly until they are close to death. One of Byrd’sassociates, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would later torture Cathy byputting a needle in her eye while her daughter, Kelly, was forced to watch, shewrites in her book.14 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266349] Leahy wasvice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and served on Byrd’s SenateAppropriations Committee. Leahy and Byrd played out a public game of ‘opposing’each other while actually working together to the same goals. The samemasquerade goes on in the parliaments of the world every day. Byrd, a cocaineaddict,15 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266470] often bragged to ‘safe’people of how he mind controlled President Jimmy Carter while he was Carter’s‘confidant and advisor’. The hypnotic voice of Byrd became the ‘voice of God’ toa praying and meditating Carter who faithfully followed the ‘guidance’ hebelieved was divine.16 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266620]Cathy’s torture and mind control was inflicted at many government establishmentsaround the States, including the NASA Space and Rocket Centre at Huntsville,Alabama, where she and later her daughter, Kelly, were used for pornographicfilms. Yes – Man on the Moon, Space Shuttle – NASA does all this. Religions areused constantly to manipulate people and as a ‘respectable’ cover for tortureand mind manipulation. One centre of Cathy’s mind programming was Salt LakeCity, Utah, the headquarters of the Mormon Church. Another establishment formind controlling slaves is known as the Charm School at Youngstown, Ohio. Thisis a sex-slave ‘school’ where Cathy says she, Kelly and countless other womenand children, were tortured and abused with electric shocks, sleep deprivationand sexual trauma. Cathy says an unnamed member of the Mellon banking family(more close friends of the Windsors) was the ‘governor’ of the Charm School.Other well known people involved were US Representative Jim Traficant and DickThornburgh, then Governor of Pennsylvania and later US Attorney General andSecretary for the United Nations, Cathy writes.17[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266710] She, and so many others like her Ihave spoken with or read about, say that part of their torture programming tookplace at Disneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida. The opening of theDisney park near Paris has given the opportunity for similar programming formind-slaves in Europe. The Disney company is a major Brotherhood operation andits films and theme parks are perfect for creating the illusions that confusethe mind of the multiple. Satanic rituals go on here and trauma-basedprogramming when the parks are closed, Cathy says. Children are targeted forkidnapping here and the ones they want get ‘lost’ in the crowds. One obviousexample of a children’s story full of mind-programming symbolism is the MGMepic, The Wizard Of Oz. The word ‘Oz’ is short for Osiris, another theme of theprogramming. Some slaves have the ‘golden penis of Osiris’ placed upon them.18[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266831] The story of The Wizard Of Oz waspublished in 1900 by Frank Baum, a member of Madam Blavatsky’s TheosophicalSociety, and it became a film in 1939. It is a mass of mystery school, Satanicand mind control symbolism and Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler include asuperb analysis of the story in their book, The Illuminati Formula Used ToCreate An Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave. Other programming centresinclude Las Vegas, Nevada, and its surrounding area. The fantasy themes of thecasinos in Vegas, like the MGM Grand, are used and one of the slave ‘auction’sites is a remote spot 20 miles from the city.19[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1266946]While still a child, Cathy says that she was raped, abused and tortured by somevery famous people. She says that she was raped by Pierre Trudeau, the long timePrime Minister of Canada, who as a Jesuit, was working closely with the Vatican;she was raped again by Gerald Ford when he was actually President; raped byRonald Reagan while he was President; and raped many times in the most brutalfashion by Dick Cheney, the White House Chief of Staff under Ford and theDefense Secretary of the United States under George Bush. Cathy is able todescribe Cheney’s office in the Pentagon in great detail. If you accept heroften highly detailed evidence you can only conclude that Cheney, like Bush, hasan immensely imbalanced mind capable of staggering violence and murder. Cathysays that Cheney told her on one occasion: “I could kill you – kill you – withmy bare hands. You’re not the first and you won’t be the last”.20[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267037] These were the characters wholaunched the Gulf War to show that ‘violence does not pay’! Cheney, Bush, andothers have ‘fun’ playing something they call The Most Dangerous Game. Itinvolves threatening government slaves like Cathy and other mind controlledchildren and adults with appalling consequences if they are caught. They arethen allowed to ‘escape’ into a forest, usually in some top secret military arealike Lampe, Missouri or Mount Shasta, California, which are surrounded by a highfence to prevent any escape. George Bush, the man who called for a “kinder,gentler America”, Dick Cheney, and Bill Clinton often go after them with guns,Cathy says in her book and newspaper interviews. When they are caught, they arebrutally raped, sometimes killed, she says. The Mount Shasta compound, whereBush and Cheney shared an office, is, according to Cathy: “The largest covertmind control slave camp of which I am aware”.21[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267158] There she saw an enormous fleet ofunmarked black helicopters, which, as researchers have revealed, are part of theBrotherhood’s private army which is being installed to instigate the coup d’étatagainst dissidents when the moment is deemed right. These helicopters have oftenbeen reported near the scenes of ‘alien’ abductions and cattle mutilations. Partof the cover for these military and mind control operations at the Shastacompound, Cathy says, is the country music scene at Lake Shasta.Cathy says she was forced to marry a mind controlled Satanist called Wayne Cox,a member of the Jack Greene country music band. Greene, a CIA operative, wasalso a Satanist, she says.22 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267249] Cox’sjob was to further traumatise her to create more compartments which could beused to program new ‘personalities’, Cathy writes. One night, she says Cox tookher with him to the ruins of the Union Railway Station in Nashville and, using aflashlight, found a homeless man asleep. He ordered Cathy to “Kiss the railroadbum goodbye” and proceeded to shoot him in the head. That was horrific enough,but then he produced a machete and chopped off the man’s hands before puttingthem into a zipper bag.23 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267340] As Cathyhas stated at public meetings many times, Wayne Cox is a serial killer whoinvariably chops off the hands of his prey. This is a Satanic signature. In aninterview published in the Contact newspaper, Cathy said:“By 1978, Wayne Cox, my first designated controller, was actively ritually anddismembering bums, children, and those who “wouldn’t be missed” and blatantlydistributing body parts from his Chatham, Louisiana, home base to key Sataniccapitals of several states which included the “Little Rock-Missouri route.”24[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267424]Government agencies know this, she says, but he is immune from prosecutionbecause he works for them. Cox led Cathy to another spot on the Union Stationsite, the tower at the old railway depot, and waiting in the room for them, shesays,were Jack Greene, members of his band and others, dressed in black robes.They were standing around a black leather altar, she claims. She describes theroom as being draped in red velvet and lit by candles. Cathy was laid on thealtar and subjected to rape and torture while the Satanists performed a blackmagic ritual that involved sex, blood, and cannibalism.25[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267550] Years later when ‘married’ toanother CIA asset, Alex Houston, she would be made pregnant and artificiallyaborted many times so the foetuses could be used for Satanic rituals, she says.Bohemian GroveThere is a sexual playground for leading American and foreign politicians,mobsters, bankers, businessmen, top entertainers, etc, who are initiates of theBabylonian Brotherhood. It is called Bohemian Grove, 75 miles north of SanFrancisco in California, near the hamlet of Monte Rio alongside the RussianRiver in Sonoma County. I went to the area in 1997 to have a look around andwhen I told the hotel receptionist where I was going she warned me to be verycareful because some people who had been to investigate had never been seenagain. Here at Bohemian Grove, Cathy, and others I have interviewed, say theywere forced to serve the perversions of their abusers. These include Satanicrituals, torture, child sacrifices, and blood drinking, which take place on theexclusive 2,700 acre estate in among the redwood trees. As Cathy says in herbook: “Slaves of advancing age or with failed programming were ritually murderedat random in the wooded grounds of Bohemian Grove and I felt it was only amatter of time until it would be me”.26[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267671] She says the Grove has a number ofrooms for different perversions including a Dark Room, a Leather Room, aNecrophilia Room, and one known as the Underground Lounge, spelt as‘U.N.derground’ on the sign. I’ve seen a covertly taken picture of robed men atBohemian Grove standing alongside a large fire worshipping a 40 foot stone owl(see picture section). The owl is the symbol of Moloch or Molech, an aspect ofNimrod/Baal. Moloch demands the sacrifice of children and it was to this deitythat the children of the Babylonians, Hebrews, Canaanites, Phoenicians andCarthaginians, were sacrificially burned. This picture provided visual supportfor the claims over many years that Druid rituals were being performed at theGrove with people in red robes marching in procession chanting to the Great Owl,Moloch. The Romans called the owl by the same word that meant witch. The Greekssaid the owl was sacred to Athene, the ancient Mesopotamian ‘Eye Goddess’, andher staring owl-like images have been found throughout the Middle East.27[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267762] The owl was also the totem ofLilith, the symbol of the bloodline genes passed on through the female, andother versions of the triple goddess of the Moon. The owl has been symbolised asa witch in bird form and is associated with witches in the symbols of Halloween.The symbolism of being able to see in the dark and with a 360 degree range ofvision are also appropriate for a Brotherhood deity. These world famousBrotherhood initiates at Bohemian Grove burn a Celtic wicker effigy at the startof their ‘camp’ to symbolise their ‘religion’. The population of Britain hasbeen manipulated into doing the same every November 5th when effigies of GuyFawkes are burned to mark the day on which he tried to blow up Parliament.A local community newspaper, The Santa Rosa Sun, reported in July 1993 about theCult of Canaan and the legend of Moloch at Bohemian Grove, but policeinvestigations into alleged murders on the site have predictably led nowhere.Regular attendees at Bohemian Grove are known as ‘grovers’ and among them arepeople like George Bush; Gerald Ford; Henry Kissinger; Dick Cheney; AlanGreenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve; Jack Kemp (Bob Dole’s running mateat the 1996 US election); Alexander Haig, the former Defense Secretary; CasperWeinberger and George Shultz, former Secretaries of State; and a long list ofthe best known politicians, businessmen, media people, and entertainers in theworld, let alone America. Steve Bechtel, the head of the world’s biggestconstruction company, attended Bohemian Grove in the 1980s while his companyenjoyed massive contracts thanks to the spending decisions of the World Bank andits president A. W. Clausen, another ‘grover’. According to researchers, thereis a waiting list of some 1,500 people anxious to pay the initiation fee of$2,500 and annual dues of $600. This is a ‘summer camp’ and Satanic centre forthe Elite who run the planet and this is where many of the real decisions aremade before they become public. I have a picture from 1957 of Ronald Reagan andRichard Nixon sitting at a table at Bohemian Grove listening to Dr GlennSeaborg, who was involved in the discovery of plutonium and worked on theManhattan Project which produced the bombs that were dropped on Japan. DoctorEdward Teller, the ‘father of the H-bomb’, was also a member. Both Reagan andNixon, part of this Elite Satanic club more than 40 years ago, would go on tobecome presidents of the United States. In fact, every Republican presidentsince Herbert Hoover in 1945 has been a member and most Democrats, includingBill Clinton.It was in Sonoma County, not far from Bohemian Grove, that 12-year-old PollyKlaas was murdered, quite obviously by Satanists, in October 1993. She waskidnapped from her bed while her mother and sister slept in the next room. Hergrandfather, Joe, had publicly endorsed a book called Breaking The Circle OfSatanic Ritual Abuse by the former Satanist, Daniel Ryder. It exposed the tiesbetween Satanists and the mind control programmes MKUltra and Project Monarch.While a man was reluctantly charged with Polly’s murder, the facts pointconclusively to a retaliation by the Satanists against her grandfather. A womancalled the FBI to say she had escaped from a coven in Sonoma County and thatPolly might be killed as part of a five-day Satanic Halloween Festival. She saidPolly might be found near the Pythian Road on Highway 12 which, coincidentally,is close to a 1,600 acre spread called the Beltane Ranch. The FBI ignored thiswarning and Polly’s body was later found near the Pythian Road. She had beensexually assaulted and decapitated, but the authorities claimed she had beenstrangled. The man who kidnapped her, Richard Alan Davis, was not even chargedwith the murder by the Sonoma County District Attorney’s office until they wereforced to act by protests from police officers.One of those who controlled Cathy O’Brien was Lt Colonel Michael Aquino of theUS Army, a top man in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Psychological WarfareDivision. I have named him in my last three books as the head of a SatanicChurch known as the Temple of Set, an organisation inspired by the leader ofHitler’s SS, Heinrich Himmler. When it was exposed that America’s psychologicalwarfare was being headed by a neo-Nazi from a Satanic Church, the officialresponse was that a man’s religion was his own business! But, as Cathy soonfound out, people like Aquino and the rest of this disturbed and possessedbunch, are above the law, because their mentality controls the law right up tothe President and beyond. Aquino’s wife, who works with him, is called LilithSinclair. Lilith is a symbol of the reptilian bloodlines and the Sinclair/StClair bloodline you know all about by now.28[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1267910] She founded the Lilith Grottowithin Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan and is a member of that Church’s Council ofNine.29 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268026] The term ‘Council of Nine’is a recurring theme in the Satanism/Brotherhood structures. LaVey’s Church ofSatan is a good example of the way Satanism and the mind control operationsinterlink. The United States has become the home for a stream of Satanicorganisations inspired by those in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. NewYork and California have long been major centres for Satanism and theBrotherhood. California was settled in the early 20th century by Haitians whopractised voodoo and Satanists from Europe, South America and Cuba also headedfor California and the San Bernandino Valley. Anton LaVey, student of AleisterCrowley, was the most famous of these and he founded the Church of Satan in1966. LaVey’s maternal grandmother came from Transylvannia, legendary home ofthe blood sucking ‘vampire’, and he loved horror movies. It was LaVey, it isclaimed, who found Marilyn Monroe working in the strip clubs and used hiscontacts to make her a movie star. He has had connections with some of thebiggest names in business, politics and entertainment, including President JohnF. Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford, and Jayne Mansfield.Sammy Davis was an early member of LaVey’s Church of Satan and Jayne Mansfieldwas a high priestess. Michael Aquino of the US Psychological Warfare Departmentworked with LaVey before they had a disagreement and Aquino launched hisbreakaway, Temple of Set. This is now, apparently, based in Austin, Texas, thepolitical base of George W. Bush, the son of the man himself.Cathy conceived a child, Kelly, with her ‘husband’ Wayne Cox, and soon Kelly wasbeing used in the same way as her mother. She says that Kelly was raped manytimes by George Bush and Dick Cheney. Bush’s Satanism and paedophilia are commonthemes of my research. In his book, The Franklin Cover Up: Child Abuse,Satanism, And Murder In Nebraska, the Nebraska State Senator John W. DeCampexposed a Satanic child abuse ring in Omaha, headed by the top Republican,Lawrence King.30 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268110] It was King whosang the national anthem at the 1984 and 1988 Republican Conventions, but waslater jailed for stealing some $40 million from the Franklin Credit Union. Itwas while investigating this scam that DeCamp uncovered the Satanic ring whichinvolved local police chiefs and Harold Andersen the publisher of the localpaper The Omaha World-Herald. Some of the paedophile ‘parties’ identified byDeCamp and his contacts were attended by… George Bush. Another Bush-relatedactivity described by researchers was Operation Brownstone. A Brownstonebuilding in Virginia, close to Washington DC, was used to compromise politiciansduring the Bush presidency by providing children for sex and filming whathappened. Before he arrived for a presidential visit to Australia in December1991, the publication Inside News asked the question: “Is George Bush theworld’s leading child abuser?”. Bush’s abuse of children is well known to anyonewho has cared to look and you don’t have to look far, either. Both Cathy andKelly were forced to have sex with animals for videos made on the orders ofPresident Ronald Reagan, Cathy says in her book. “Uncle Ron” liked nothing morethan to watch these videos and they were known as “Uncle Ronnie’s Bed-timeStories”.31 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268316] They were recorded andproduced, Cathy says, by his pornographer, Michael Dante (also known as MichaelViti). She says that Dante had connections with the Mafia and the CIA (samething at their top levels), and was a close associate of politicians like GuyVanderJagt, Gerald Ford, Dick Thornburgh, Jim Traficant, and Gary Ackerman.32[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268437] It was Dante who installed thetiny hidden cameras which recorded the sexual activities of US and foreignpoliticians so they could be blackmailed into supporting the Brotherhood Agenda,Cathy recalls. How many ‘leaders’ today are following certain policies againstthe interests of the people because if they didn’t, the evidence of their sexualexploits would be revealed. Cathy writes that Reagan’s leading pornographer wasa man called Larry Flynt of the pornography magazine, Hustler. 33[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268528] He was the subject of a filmcalled The People V Larry Flynt. He too has CIA, Mafia and Vatican connections,she says.34 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268626] Bill Clinton wascompromised in this way, on one occasion, by his boss, oops, sorry, ‘opponent’,George Bush, Cathy told an American alternative newspaper. It happened at theLampe, Missouri, mind control facility known as Swiss Villa. She says that Bushordered her daughter, Kelly, to perform oral sex on Clinton while Clinton wasdoing the same with Cathy. She recalls the following exchange:“Clinton pushed his way out from under me and told Bush while he glanced aroundfor the camera: “You didn’t need to do that. I’m with you anyway. My positiondoes not need to be compromised.” Clinton was apparently referring to theblackmail tactics amongst the Order of the Rose elite. World leaders were alwayscompromised through covertly filmed bizarre sexual activity as was my experienceat the Bohemian Grove.”35 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268717] (TheOrder of the Rose is another exclusive secret society)After this encounter, Bush and Clinton, discussed introducing Clinton’sdaughter, Chelsea, to the child abuse scene, Cathy says. Bush offered to “Openher up”. Clinton said he would have to discuss it with Hillary.36[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268848] Clinton and his vice-president, AlGore, were quite a pairing. Two former Satanists from different groups have saidthat Gore is addicted to drinking blood.37[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1268932] This makes sense because ArizonaWilder, the Brotherhood Mother Goddess who escaped from their clutches, told mehow she has seen Gore at sacrifice rituals when he shape-shifted into areptilian. Many Satanic initiates have the same addiction to the adrenalchromewhich is released in the body just before a person is sacrificed.38[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269048] It is produced by the pineal glandduring periods of terror. Cathy says that she and Kelly were raped by anotherCanadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who is addicted to sex with mindcontrolled slaves.39 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269132] Mindcontrolled mothers and young daughters were, and are, regularly transported toNiagara Falls just over the Canadian border for Mulroney to rape them.40[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269253] It was Mulroney in his period asPrime Minister who forced upon the Canadian people the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA), which is set to become the Americas’ version of the EuropeanUnion. The agreement was manipulated into existence by his fellow rapist, GeorgeBush, and later by Bill Clinton. Under the orders of President Reagan’s personalattaché, Philip Habib, Cathy says, she was forced to have sex on severaloccasions with the Brotherhood stooge, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. The Saudiroyal family serve as puppet leaders while suppressing their people with abrutal religion which they themselves do not even begin to observe. Americanmind controlled slaves are also ‘sold’ to Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and othercountries to help fund the covert operations of the New World Order.Cathy was so powerfully mind controlled that she was ‘promoted’ to become whatis known as a Presidential Model, a mind controlled slave who is detailed tooperate with the top people in the White House and the Pentagon. She was used topass messages between Reagan, Bush and their foreign associates such as thedictators, Baby Doc Duvalier of Haiti, President Miguel De La Madrid of Mexicoand Manuel Noriega of Panama, a paid CIA operative working for the US governmentillegal drug trade. Cathy says she observed one party attended by Air Forceofficials and their wives, drug barons like the Pueto Rican, Jose Busto and the‘hero’ (I feel ill) of the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal, Oliver North.Upstairs were Noriega, Michael Aquino, and Senator Allen Simpson, the‘Republican’ from Wyoming, she says.41[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269344] While all this was going on,George Bush was having a “war on drugs” to “save the American children”. Cocaineaddict Bill Clinton would later do the same. Cathy says she met Clinton a fewtimes and on one occasion in Arkansas, he was trying (successfully) to persuadea supporter, Bill Hall, to become involved in the drugs trade. Hall need notworry, Clinton said, because it was “Reagan’s operation”. Cathy says thatClinton told Hall in her then mind controlled presence:“Bottom line is, we’ve got control of the (drugs) industry, therefore we’ve gotcontrol of them (suppliers and buyers). You control the guy underneath you anduncle (Uncle Sam, the United States Government) has you covered. What have yougot to lose? No risk. No-one’s going to hang you out to dry. And whatever spillsoff the truck as it passes through (Clinton laughed here and snorted anothernose-full of cocaine) you get to clean up.”42[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269465]Later that night, Cathy says, she was taken by Bill Hall’s wife to meet HillaryClinton at the Hall’s guest villa. There Mrs Clinton, another cocaine user,43[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269556] performed oral sex on Cathy andthen insisted it was done to her.44[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269681] Both President Clinton and hisfirst lady knew Cathy was a mind controlled slave and they know what is goingon. So does Al Gore. They keep quiet because they are part of what is going on.Hillary Clinton is a sixth degree Illuminati witch and slave handler, accordingto some researchers.45 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269802] Cathy actedas a robotic messenger for Clinton who was very adept at triggering herprogramming, as she has stated publicly many times. Clinton and Bush may seem tobe opponents in ‘different’ political parties, but they are part of the samescam. Cathy O’Brien says she has confirmed from her own direct experience whatresearchers like myself and others have been suggesting for years: Bush wasPresident during the ‘Reagan years’, President through his own ‘official’ periodin the oval office, and pulled strings again during the ‘Clinton’ regime underorders from a higher authority. Cathy says she met Bush and Clinton togetheryears before Clinton was even publicly considered a possible presidentialcandidate. She once observed them at Swiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri. The‘infirmary’ on the site is home to a CIA near-death trauma centre, she says.Cathy, under mind control, had delivered a large amount of cocaine there in amotorhome when she saw the two future presidents:“…I noticed then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at a corner table withHillary talking to the then vice-president George Bush, and their two specialforces ‘toy soldiers’ (mind controlled) who had transferred the cocaine to theinfirmary building. My mind control owner, US Senator, Robert Byrd, told me thatBush and others had been grooming Bill Clinton for the presidency in the eventthat the American public became disillusioned with Republicans and believe thatelecting a Democrat would make a difference. Clinton obediently followed Bush’sorders. Since the implementation of what Hitler termed ‘New World Order’, knewno party lines, the question should be raised as to the agenda of Clinton’s 1992presidential campaign manager, James Carville, and his wife, Mary Matalin, whowas Bush’s campaign manager.”46 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1269924]Another Clinton-Bush connection is their love of hunting mind controlled men,women, and children, in The Most Dangerous Game. Cathy describes one of herexperiences at Swiss Villa when Clinton and Bush went hunting with dogs forherself, her daughter, Kelly and two mind controlled ‘toy soldiers’, one of whomhad Italian-looking features:“Swiss Villa appeared deserted, except for Bill Clinton and George Bush whostood at the edge of the woods with their hunting dogs at the ready to embark on‘The Most Dangerous Game’ of human hunting. (Clinton shared Bush’s passion fortraumatising and hunting humans)… Bush and Clinton were dressed alike incamouflage pants, army boots, and wind breakers. The two also shared thetrademark of wearing a cap of cryptic meaning. This time, Bush’s camouflage caphad an orange insignia which said ‘Dear Hunter’. Clinton’s blue cap read: ‘AimHigh’ and had a picture of a rifle on it. Clinton appeared awkward with hishunting rifle, while Bush looked like an expert marksman with his black riflewith elaborate scope.“‘The rules of the game are simple’ Bush began, triggering me by using the samewords that always preceded a most dangerous game.“Clinton interrupted: ‘You run. We hunt.’“Bush continued: ‘This will be called “Hunt for a Virgin”’ (Clinton chuckled)‘and she’s it.’ He pointed to Kelly who was still in my arms. ‘I catch you,she’s mine.’“Clinton spoke up: ‘You’ll have plenty of time to play with the dogs becausethey’ll have you pinned down while we…’ (he slid a bullet in the chamber foremphasis) ‘…hunt down the bigger game.’ Clinton glared at the ‘toy soldier’ withthe waxy face. Toy soldier was a term I often heard referring to themind-controlled robotic ‘special forces’ young men who operated under the NewWorld Order.“The two guys ran for the woods. Carrying Kelly I began running, too. Judgingfrom the close proximity of the dogs barks, I had not gone far when they wereturned lose. The five barking dogs caught me right away and surrounded me. Kellyscreamed as one snapped at her leg and I automatically slapped at its face. Iwas convinced that the dogs were going to tear us up by the time Bush andClinton walked into the clearing. They seemed to be engaged in a seriousconversation until Bush looked up and smiled.“‘She’s mine’, he claimed (referring to Kelly). ‘But then, she always has been.Let go.’“As I walked passed Clinton, who was deep in thought, he mumbled ‘I thoughtyou’d be fucking a dog or something’. We walked the short way back in silencewith Clinton veering off to the right as Bush directed me toward the twohelicopters. The door of the helicopter next to me slid open and Clinton pushedthe Italian into the helicopter. ‘I caught this one. He’s going to ride jumpseat.’ Bush motioned for him to sit in the leather chair marked for death by theblack rose while I rode in the actual jump seat.“‘Come here little one’ Bush coaxed Kelly. ‘You can sit on Uncle George’s lap.’He lifted her onto his lap as Clinton got in front with the pilot who wasstarted the engines. ‘Over the lake, Jake’, Bush told the pilot.“Flying over Swiss Villa’s deep remote lake, Bush set Kelly aside, stood up asfar as he was able in the helicopter, and slid the door open. The powerful windblew Bush’s greasy strands from his face as he gestured for the man (theItalian) to stand up.“‘Free fall’, Bush instructed. ‘That’s an order.’“‘Yes sir’ he replied as he stepped out of the door fully clad in his camouflageuniform and military boots – with no parachute. I watched in horror as he fellto his death in the water below, splatter and submerge…”47[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270055]The United States might lose its freedom? My God. The United States has neverbeen free. The mind controlled slaves are programmed to mind control others andthere are now fantastic numbers of mind controlled children and adults at large.There are whole armies of them like the Delta Force, the ‘toy soldiers’, in theUnited States and other ‘élite’ (often psychopathic) groupings like the SAS andthe Parachute Regiment in the United Kingdom. The name, Delta, symbolises thepyramid and also relates to the Nile Delta and the ancient Egyptians. ‘Delta’programming creates killers, assassins. The training alone for these people isclassic mind control, never mind all the individual stuff they experience. Thechildren being prepared to join the Delta Force later in life are put throughindescribable horrors to desensitise them from pain and death, both forthemselves and others. One of the techniques to do this is to bond the childinto a close relationship with another child and then to incinerate their friendwhile they are forced to watch. The Brotherhood know that to take over the worldby open force eventually they must have a mind controlled army which would notbe affected by what they do to their fellow countrymen and even their ownfamilies. Why in wars like Bosnia and in mass murders like those in Algeria dopeople report how sons have slaughtered their own families along with the restof a village or community? Because they are mind controlled to do it, that’swhy. It is the same with the ‘suicide bombers’ and other ‘kamikaze’ operations.In the same way it is the mind controlled Elite, and their lower level ‘gofers’,who are in the positions of political, business, military, administrative,media, and religious power in the world. To an untrained eye, such programmingis undetectable, but these people are following a programmed Agenda. At a deeplevel, they are automatons controlled by reptilians.When the slaves outlive their usefulness or their programming begins to breakdown, they are murdered. The so-called Presidential Models like Cathy O’Brienare rarely allowed to live beyond their 30th year and when that came for Cathyin 1987/88, she was told it was her last year of life. Fortunately as her bookexplains, she and the then eight year old Kelly would be rescued from death by abusinessman called Mark Phillips. He says he had considerable knowledge ofadvanced mind control techniques from his time working for the Ampex Corporationand the US Department of Defense as a civilian subcontractor. This gave himcontact with the leading research scientists in this field and he had access toknowledge that is denied to the mainstream psychiatric profession, he writes inTrance Formation Of America. Psychiatrists, like doctors and scientists, arealso mind-manipulated by the suppression of information which gives them adistorted picture of what is possible. Mark Phillips says he was apparentlyregarded as ‘safe’ because of his background and security clearance and he wasapproached by a man called Alex Houston for support with a business deal.Houston was now the ‘handler’ of Cathy and Kelly and he married Cathy at theinstruction of her controller, Senator Robert C. Byrd, their book says.48[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270145]Alex Houston, a rapist, paedophile, and drug runner, according to Cathy, was anentertainer, a ventriloquist and stage hypnotist, who, she says, also had hismind and mouth worked by someone else – the US government’s mind controlnetwork. She says it was his job to maintain her and Kelly in their programmedmode by following the instructions he was given, which included food and waterdeprivation and constant trauma. Houston used his travel to venues as a cover totransport Cathy and Kelly to their ‘assignments’ and Cathy says this introducedher to the truth about the United States country music industry and, indeed, theentertainment industry in general. Country music, she discovered, was used bythe Brotherhood’s US agencies to distribute massive amounts of drugs intoAmerican society and as a cover for its mind control projects. It was theseagencies, she says, which paid for the promotion and hype that turned a singercalled Boxcar Willie into a country music star. Some of this promotion, Cathysays, took the form of high-tech television commercials designed to have ahypnotic effect on the viewer. He became the leader, she writes, of the countrymusic segment of the ‘Freedom train’ – the internationally recognised code namefor the slave operations of Project Monarch. The name Boxcar Willie was notselected at random, it would seem. It makes a statement about the man and hisrole. Cathy names Boxcar Willie as a paedophile rapist of mind controlled womenand children, including Kelly, who, she says, he raped regularly in threedifferent mental institutions.49 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270266]He is also heavily involved in the cocaine operations controlled by thegovernment agencies, she says, and he was the man Bill Clinton’s friend, BillHall, began to work with after Clinton persuaded him to become involved.50[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270364] It was Boxcar Willie who inspiredthe moving of the country music ‘capital’ to Branson, Missouri, to be close tothe CIA mind control and drug operation based at Lampe, Missouri, according toCathy in her book.51 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270455]Many people in the entertainment industry are either connected with theconspiracy or mind controlled by it, she says. One of the latter was MarilynMonroe, a lover of President John F. Kennedy. Both were to be murdered. Thesinger, Madonna, is a mind controlled slave according to Springmeier and Wheelerin their book on this subject. Springmeier says he was given a catalogue of theVidimax occult porn video club based in New Jersey which included a videoinvolving Madonna. It sells videos of people being murdered (snuff videos),cannibalism and sacrifices.52 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270585]Springmeier and Wheeler say Madonna was a mind controlled slave given the name,Louise Chiccone, living in New York East Village when a film was made of herbeing raped and the rapist being taken away and sacrificed. Vidimax sell thisvideo apparently for $19 to their members.53[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270701] If, as they say, Madonna is amultiple, she will most likely have no recollection of this. Elvis Presley, amember of the Theosophical Society, has been named as a multiple slave bysurvivors and Cisco Wheeler, herself a recovering slave, says that herexperiences led her to believe this about Elvis. His handler was his manager,‘Colonel’ Tom Parker, she says.54 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270792]When Elvis died (if he did), the Sun International Corporation released aPresley album called Orion with a winged sun-disc on the cover. This is anancient Egyptian and Sumerian symbol used by the Order of the Oriental Templarsand other Brotherhood groups. Barbara Streisand is a mind controlled asset ofthe Brotherhood, as revealed in detail by the recovered slave, Brice Taylor, inher book, Thanks For The Memories. Another mind controlled singer, according toCathy, is Lorretta Lynn, a slave of the CIA. Her mental and emotional problemsare caused by this, Cathy says. Lorretta’s road manager Ken Riley is apaedophile and best friend to Cathy’s handler, Alex Houston. Both were connectedwith US congressman, Gary Ackerman, the ‘Democrat’ from New York, who, Cathyreports, ran an elaborate drug operation through Long Island docks.55[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1270890] A mind controlled woman named byMark Phillips is Seidina ‘Dina’ Reed, the daughter of actor-singer, Jerry Reed.Seidina had been used many times with Cathy in pornographic films, he says,under the control of her husband, the sadist, David Rorick, (also known as DaveRowe). Rorick was trained in mind control by Alex Houston and Seidina’s famousfather Jerry Reed knew all about it, according to Mark Phillips. Seidina was afavourite sex slave of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Arabian ambassador tothe US.56 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271011] The singer and actorKris Kristopherson, a drug-addicted alcoholic born into a CIA family, accordingto Phillips, is also involved as a seriously imbalanced controller and mindmanipulator of slaves, Cathy recounts in her book and public statements.57[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271108] She writes that she was torturedby him and Michael Aquino, using high voltage electric shocks.58[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271206] Kristopherson, a Jesuit, is anassociate of Senator Robert C. Byrd, Cathy’s controller, she says. In thatposition, Byrd was, in mind control parlance, said to be ‘married’ to Cathy eventhough she was officially married to Alex Houston. Cathy says of Kristophersonin her book:“…Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis which furthersexually aroused him, late in the Summer of 1987 during another incident relatedto Byrd.”59 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271304]A world famous psychopath and drug runner for the government, Cathy writes, isthe rock and roll legend, Jerry Lee Lewis, a friend of Elvis Presley. Cathy saysshe was threatened on many occasions with the words: “We’ll sell you to JerryLee”. Frank Sinatra and JFK’s brother, Ted Kennedy, are reported by recoveringslaves to have been particularly brutal, also. I spoke at a conference on mindcontrol in the United States and met Brice Taylor who, like Cathy O’Brien, alsobecame a Presidential Model. Her handler from the time she was a little girl insouthern California was the comedian, Bob Hope, a member of Bohemian Grove. Shehad also worked extensively with Henry Kissinger, a highly skilled programmer,and Nelson Rockefeller, the four times Governor of New York. Rockefeller becamevice-president of the United States when the paedophile, Gerald Ford, replacedRichard Nixon after Watergate. Brice claimed to have been forced to have sexwith John F. Kennedy when she was only 12, although she said: “I was made up tolook 16”. Bob Hope is also named by Springmeier and Wheeler in their book as aslave handler and as a British Intelligence operative during the Second WorldWar as he toured the world hosting concerts for the troops.60[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271402] Hope and media mogul, RupertMurdoch, were both awarded ‘knighthoods’ by the Roman Catholic Church in LosAngeles, California. They became Knights of the Order of St Gregory and while Iwas writing this book Hope was given an honorary knighthood by the Queen toelevate him to the same rank as Bush, Kissinger, and the other chosen few theWindsor’s reward for services to the cause. Bob ‘isn’t he a hoot’ Hope has beenused to draw many top names in Hollywood into the net and one of his most famousfilms, The Road To Mandalay, was appropriately named because the most élitegroup at the Bohemian Grove is known as the Mandalay Camp. Hollywood and theentertainment industry is rife with both slaves and handlers.Another famous figure named by Springmeier and Wheeler as a Satanist is theworld’s best known ‘Christian’ preacher, Billy Graham.61[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271518] Springmeier and Wheeler haveassembled a list of people who have seen Graham ‘in action’. They also say heuses Project Monarch slaves for sex and he launders drug money through hisevangelical operation. Graham is a Brotherhood stooge who carries messagesbetween world leaders.62 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271613] Thewitnesses say that Graham is a multiple who switches personalities, and the‘person’ people see at the pulpit is only one compartment. There are otherswhich are very different. ‘Christianity’ is a cover used by countless Satanistsand programmers and Dr Loreda Fox says in her book, The Spiritual And ClinicalDimensions of Multiple Personality Disorder, that “Most survivors whom I haveworked with had Satanist parents who were high in positions in churches; manywere pastors”.63 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271710] Christianity wasthe creation of the Brotherhood and is still controlled by it. Billy Graham, a33rd degree Freemason, is a close friend of George Bush and Henry Kissinger. Heand Bush famously ‘prayed’ together after Bush had given the go ahead to killcountless men, women and children in the Gulf War. Another friend of Graham,Allan Dulles, was the Satanist Director of the CIA, who helped to fund Hitler.Dulles was one of the main architects after the war of MKUltra and ProjectMonarch. Billy Graham’s first three Christian crusades were funded by WilliamRandolph Hearst, the American newspaper tycoon and high degree Brotherhoodinitiate.64 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1271908] Other world tours havebeen funded by bloodline families like the Rockefellers, Whitneys, andVanderbilts. The main people in the Billy Graham Crusades and his EvangelicalAssociation are Freemasons and they have included William M. Watson, Presidentof the Occidental Petroleum Corporation of the Brotherhood frontman, ArmandHammer (Arm and Hammer). The Billy Graham television shows put messages on thescreen carrying Monarch activation codes, Springmeier and Wheeler say.65[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272024] When Billy Graham’s family firstwent to the United States they were known as the Frank family and were relatedto Jakob Frank the leader of a branch of Satanism called Sabbatuanism, later,due to his leadership, Frankism.66 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272115]The evidence that Springmeier and Wheeler present to support these claims aboutGraham is simply enormous and covers some 24 pages. A Presidential Model told methat Pope John Paul II is a programmed multiple and that certainly fits thepicture.Cathy O’Brien says that she and her daughter, Kelly, escaped from ProjectMonarch when Mark Phillips came on the scene. He says he worked with AlexHouston on a big business deal involving Hong Kong and China, but then he wastold by a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Defence about Houston’sbackground and his involvement with the CIA, drugs, money laundering, childprostitution, and slavery. Phillip’s informant, who, he says, produceddocumentary proof, said that Houston was a “very bad man” and that his crimeswere “of the White House”. Mark Phillips writes in Trance Formation Of America:“My first response to this ‘officer’ was that Houston was too stupid and crookedto be connected with US ‘Intelligence’. This comment was quickly countered witha gutwrenching photograph of Houston. He was smiling a demonic grin whileapparently having anal sex with a small, very young, frightened black boy. Laterhe was identified to me as Haitian.”67[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272206]Phillips says he made contact with an old friend, now dead, who had been an AirForce general in the Intelligence Division and maintained close connections withthe upper levels of US and foreign intelligence. He says the general told himabout the CIA slave trade world-wide and that Cathy and Kelly had been subjectedto trauma-based mind control. Mark Phillips recalls:“I was growing numb. The first words out of my dry mouth were: ‘How would youspring these people out of it?’“He smiled and said: ‘I wouldn’t! What are you going to do with them if you getthem out?’ Before I could answer, he interrupted and said: ‘Look. You’re stillthe same, but nothing else is with Uncle (the USA). Now most of the CIA, FBI,and the Mob (Mafia) are the same and they’re making moves on the military.’”68[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272326]Phillips says he was insistent that he wanted to attempt a rescue and he writesthat his friend gave him the mind control codes (based on Christianity and God)that would activate Cathy to go with him. The full and detailed story is told intheir book. Phillips says he took them to Alaska while leaving messages for theauthorities that he had no intention of exposing the truth. He said he told themhe would “…take them to Alaska and play like a voiceless chameleon”. This hehoped would spare their lives at this stage, he says. Phillips told me that theyhave also been helped by many good people in Intelligence who want to root outthis sickness. There is an internal ‘war’ unfolding within the Intelligencecommunity, it would appear. In Alaska, Mark Phillips says he used his knowledgeof mind control, with covert support from his contacts, to deprogram Cathy’scompartmentalised mind. This immense task absorbed almost every spare wakingmoment month after month after month, he says. Cathy began to remember what hadhappened, she says, and what a story she now had to tell. Kelly’s deprogrammingproved even more difficult and she suffered from severe asthma caused by theconstant trauma she has suffered. Attempts were made by the CIA mind controller,Dr Louis Jolyon West, and his associates, to take Kelly from Cathy and Mark.Eventually the authorities used the ‘law’ to ensure they had control of her onceagain. Kelly became a political prisoner under the custody of the State ofTennessee. This is a story constantly repeated. Brice Taylor and Arizona Wilderlost their children when they broke away. Brice’s daughter is also called Kelly,a common illuminati name for such children. Her daughter was also sexuallyabused by Bush. The media and public were banned from court cases involvingKelly O’Brien and she was denied the right to an independent attorney, Cathysays. The court also banned the words ‘president’, ‘politics’, ‘New WorldOrder’, ‘mind control’ and ‘George Bush’.69[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272420] All this was ‘justified’ by theinterests of ‘national security’. These restrictions were significantly easedafter the publication of their book. The authorities refuse to deprogram Kellyfrom her Project Monarch-MKUltra mind control by invoking the National SecurityAct (amended by Reagan in 1984) which allows them the excuse of ‘nationalsecurity’ whenever they want to put the lid on something. Whenever you seegovernments using the guise of ‘national security’ to deny justice andinformation, what they really mean is the security of their own criminalbehaviour. Cathy and Mark say they have had their life threatened many times,but they have sent their information, with documented and sometimes audio tapesupport, to a catalogue of US politicians, government agencies, and pressuregroups, including presidential candidate and Brotherhood yes man, Bob Dole. Thesilence has been deafening.Cathy says she witnessed many conversations about the New World Order whichsupport the themes that I and scores of others have written about, including theplans for a military coup of the United States. As Cathy’s experiences confirm,the attempt to complete the takeover of the world is not a theory, it is REAL.It’s happening now. Cathy says that she heard both Reagan and Bush insist thatthe only way to “world peace” is the “mind control of the masses”. She reportsthat she was able to observe the planning of the New World Order project,Education 2000, while under the control of another of her and Kelly’sprogrammers and sexual abusers, the reptilian Bill Bennett, a Jesuit-trainedmind controller, who became US Education Secretary under Reagan-Bush.70[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272518] She was then placed under thecontrol of Bill Bennett’s associate Lama Alexander, the former governor ofTennessee, with whom Cathy says she had been forced to take part in a Satanicritual in an affluent area of Nashville.71[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272609] Bill Bennett’s brother, Bob, whois also alleged to have raped Kelly at the Bohemian Grove in 1986, later becamelegal counsel to Bill Clinton.72 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272700]Another of Bill Bennett’s roles was to head a ‘war on drugs’ for George Bush!Well at least Bennett could not be accused of a lack of experience in thesubject. The Bennetts’ were the ones who took her through one of her reptilianexperiences I described earlier in the book. Cathy says she was used tocompromise and provide ‘favours’ for key politicians to ensure support forEducation 2000. She learned that this project, also known as America 2000 andGlobal 2000, is designed to increase children’s ‘learning’ capacity whiledestroying their ability to critically think for themselves.73[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272784] Our children are being mindcontrolled every day at school and most of the teachers don’t even know they aredoing it, because they have been conditioned by the same system. A friend whoworks in education research in the United Kingdom has had access to suppressedsurveys which show that children are asking fewer and fewer questions about the‘facts’ they are told in school – particularly after they move to the seniorschools.Cathy says she witnessed how the United Nations is just a vehicle for themanipulators. George Bush referred to the New World Order as his ‘neighbourhood’and talked of how he simply told many other world leaders, like King Fahd ofSaudi Arabia, what to do and say. No doubt the same applies to Saddam Husseinwith whom Bush shared oil ‘kick backs’ totalling hundreds of millions of dollars(see …And The Truth Shall Set You Free). The US Secretary of State (formerly UNambassador), Madeleine Albright, is a Brotherhood initiate. I call her the HighPriestess of US politics. George Bush once described her in Cathy’s presence as…“the reverend mother of all sisters (slaves)”.74[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272875] Albright knows about the USgovernment mind controlled slaves and supports that policy. Yet there she was infront of the television cameras at the United Nations and as Secretary of State,lecturing other countries on human rights. Cathy recalls that Brian Mulroney,the Canadian Prime Minister and child rapist, talked about the plan for the NewWorld Order while with Cathy and Reagan at the same White House cocktail partyat which she met Albright. Cathy says she was subsequently taken to a WhiteHouse bedroom with other slaves, including one controlled by the US Senator,Arlen Spector. Mulroney then arrived to rape them after activating their sexslave programming.75 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1272966] Cathy saysshe noticed that one of the slaves had a red rose tattooed on her left wrist andother people she met over the years, including Mulroney, wore the symbol of thered rose which indicates membership of the Order of the Rose, an Elite offshootof the Rosicrucians. Other people connected to the Order of the Rose includeClinton, Bush, Byrd, Bennett and Trudeau. How fascinating, then, that the UnitedKingdom Labour Party should change its party symbol in the 1980s to a… red rose.The handlers of slaves like Cathy carry with them a black or grey three-ringnotebook – often these days a laptop computer – which lists the access keys andtriggers.76 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273057] Others memorise them.The data contains details of the methods of torture, the dates it happened, andthe most important parts of the code are said to be written in ‘Enochian’ Hebrew(the ‘magical’ language of the Egyptian mystery schools), and Druidic symbols.77[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273146] The scale of what is going onsimply defies the imagination. I was told by a contact about thousands of cagedchildren kept at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in the California desert atRidgecrest. This is in the same region as the mass grave for ritually murderedchildren at Lancaster, California, I mentioned earlier. Vast areas of land inthis region between Los Angeles, the infamous San Bernandino Valley and LasVegas, Nevada, are occupied by the United States Forces. It is also one of thegreatest areas of Satanism on the planet. It includes the Edward’s Airforcebase, China Lake, and the town of Bakersfield. Springmeier and Wheeler writethat other programming sites close to China Lake are Papa Ludo’s Store andTavern which has a secret underground programming centre, and Scotty’s Castle inthe appropriately named Death Valley.78[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273230] The ‘local’ for the CIA personneloperating at China Lake was the former Hideaway Tavern. Northwest of theairfield at China Lake the authorities have built a hexagram (Star of David –Seal of Solomon) on the ground, each section of which is a quarter of a milelong.79 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273345] These lands run into thedeserts of Nevada which are full of Brotherhood operations in and around theirwholly-owned city of Las Vegas. I have driven through all these areas and it isone of blackest places you will ever experience.Interestingly, the Springmeier-Wheeler research also documents the involvementof the China Lake Naval Weapons Center which I had also heard from othersources. They say that ‘batches’ of babies numbering one, two and threethousand, were kept at China Lake in cages piled to the ceiling of largehangers.80 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273429] The cages, known as‘Woodpecker Grids’ were electrified and the babies were tortured with powerfulelectric shocks.81 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273519] A male survivorof Project Monarch tells of seeing the rows and rows of cages at China Lake andone of the programmers, he said, was dressed like a catholic priest.82[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273603] He described how the electriccurrent running through the cages made a humming sound and he said that childrenwere sacrificed by people in black hooded robes in front of the children in thecages. This took place on a marble slab which served as an altar.83[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273693] Charles Manson was a slaveprogrammed at China Lake and his cult was based only 45 minutes drive away atthe Myers and Barker ranches.84 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273777]Josef Mengele (Dr Green or Greenbaum) and Ewen Cameron (Dr White) both worked atChina Lake after the war. It was then called the Naval Ordinance Test Station orNOTS.Survivors of China Lake recall flashing lights. The flashing createsdisassociation, particularly with those who are programmed, and this is why thephenomenon of flashing lights was introduced into our culture. Discos and popconcerts are an obvious example. The operation at China Lake is closelyconnected with the California Institute of Technology at Pasedena.85[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273861] Children are transported to ChinaLake by train, car and air. One of the main delivery routes into China Lake isby plane from the Santa Rosa airstrip near Bohemian Grove. The airstrip wasbuilt during World War Two as a training base. FEMA, the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, has a radio station there.86[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1273951] FEMA is officially the governmentagency which responds to disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. But in truthit is a major arm of the Brotherhood and it is building concentration camps inthe United States capable of holding thousands of people. This is no theory,video footage exists of some of these places. They have railway lines runninginto them in classic Nazi fashion. The tops of the barbed wire fences, whichwere formerly designed to keep people out, have now been changed to keep peoplein. The Santa Rosa strip is supposed to be closed, yet planes are leaving thereevery night and they do not put their lights on until they are hundreds of feetin the air.87 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274035] They land at ChinaLake early in the morning. If you think the numbers of children claimed to beinvolved are an exaggeration, the truth is that this is only a fraction of thechildren in mind control projects and Satanic abuse rings in every country inthe world. The children come through the breeding programmes, through adoptionagencies (particularly, it seems, Catholic ones), some from kidnapping in theThird World, and from parents who sell their own children. They also comethrough the network of Social Services agencies. There are organisations whosejob it is to find children of the right genetic background for these projects.The best known was the CIA/FBI group called the Finders and programmed childrenare also trained to procure other children. One case which came to light inFebruary 1992 involved an American lawyer called Patrick Gagel, who exportedthree thousand children from the United States to Peru for ‘adoption’ and theywere never seen or heard of again.88[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274119] Gagel was arrested by Peruvianpolice, but then released after pressure from ‘on high’.89[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274203] This is another common theme inwhich the perpetrators of such abominations can operate outside the law. DonEcker, the state director in Idaho for the UFO investigation network known asMUFON, wrote the following in the July-August 1989 edition of UFO magazine:“According to a recent report just received from Westchester County, New York,researchers have discovered that in a small area of the county, which has beenthe site of numerous UFO overflights and reported human abductions, over 3,000missing children reports have surfaced. After extensive investigation by localpolice departments, these children have not yet been found at centers for youngrunaways or in red light districts. Researchers and law enforcement officialsare baffled.”90 [../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274287]The mind controlled EliteThe Brotherhood scientists realised that the ability to disassociate quickly ispassed on from generation to generation through genetics. This is why the CIAtargeted Cathy O’Brien. She was the daughter of parents who had themselves beensexually abused as children and therefore the parents ability to disassociate tocope with their childhood trauma would have been passed on to their children.This makes the children much more open to disassociation via trauma-based mindcontrol. There is no greater example of this than the bloodline familiesthemselves. They put their children through staggering traumas and abuse andthis multigenerational genetic ‘baton’ has made these families particularly opento disassociation by mind control. They apparently put their children through aseries of tests around the age of 18 months to determine which of them are mostopen to disassociation. They are then programmed through their childhood tothink the way the Brotherhood wants them to think so they will take the Agendaforward into the next generation. It is the mind controlled manipulating themind controlled. According to the experiences of Cisco Wheeler and many of theother victims and therapists involved in this subject, the child of the Elitefamilies are conceived according to ancient rituals and their programming isagreed and set out largely before they are even born. One of these pre-birthrituals is called the Moon Child ceremony. Mothers who give birth to a so-called‘dark child’ are called a ‘Rosemary’ – the rose of Mary. Roman Polanski, thehusband of Sharon Tate, the actress murdered by Charles Manson’s cult, made afilm called Rosemary’s Baby. Polanski’s film was about a woman impregnated by ademon summoned by a Satanic cult. Over the centuries it became understood thatif you torture a child in the womb the baby would disassociate or ‘split’ and somothers are traumatised during pregnancy to traumatise the child. Needles areinserted into the womb to stab the baby. Many are induced prematurely because ofthe effect that has on them and it is also part of the selection process.A child who shows the instinct and spirit for survival in a premature birth willnormally enlist that same spirit during the trauma-programming which will oftentake them to near death. After birth, a programmer is assigned to them. This isnormally a woman, although it can be male. The Brotherhood children are oftenassigned a programmer known in the hierarchy as a Grande Dame.91[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274413] Children are ‘bonded’ to theprogrammers and taught to become dependent upon them. The idea is to manipulatethe children to worship the programmer and see them as a god. The child is onlyallowed to develop a close relationship with the programmer and thatrelationship is based on adoration, dependency and obedience. They are taughttotal obedience to the programmer and later to the Agenda and the Brotherhoodhierarchy. Once the process of crying has developed their lungs, they are taughtnot to cry through a series of punishments and rewards under the system known asbehaviour modification. Already they are becoming robots. One foundationtechnique is to give them intense love and affection for the first 18 months oftheir lives and then suddenly withdraw it and treat them with extreme cruelty.This is a technique known as ‘love bombing’ and when the switch is made fromlove to cruelty the trauma this creates in the child is enormous. They will alsobe allowed to bond with a pet and then the pet is killed. The programmer thechild loved so much is now the person the child fears with equal intensity.Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler, herself a victim of government programming,describe what follows:“Everything imaginable can be used to overwhelm the caged little child’s sensesand create dissociation. Rotten foul odours of the child’s excrement, ofammonia, and rotten food while it huddles in its cage will overwhelm the child’ssense of smell. Being fed blood overwhelms the sense of taste. The chanting ofthe programmers dressed in Satanic garb, banging noises, rock music, and theelectric hum, and ultrasonic stimulation overwhelms the child’s sense ofhearing. The child’s natural developing sense of shapes is taken advantage of byspinning the child and making it feel like it is going to fall. The child willalso be deprived of sleep and drugged…“…The fourth stage is to strip the child of everything nice and lovely in theworld. The child is caged and tormented by electric shock. The child’s senseswill be overloaded and they will become numb. Eyewitnesses have described thesehundreds of numbered children as ‘zombies’… In the fourth step, the child isstarved, cold, and naked. When they finally see their beloved master or belovedadult caretaker appear after suffering from 42 to 72 hours, they are excited andthey dissociate the pain of the previous hours of deprivation. Help appears tobe on the scene. At that point the programmer/ beloved adult shows her/his mostvicious side, and the child in order to deal with how this loving caretaker hasnot only rejected them, but is now hurting them, dissociates along the samelines of dissociation created by the trauma of the premature birth.”92[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274528]How can the Brotherhood initiates be so inhuman? Because they are reptilians, orrather that group of reptilians on the lower fourth dimension and they do nothave the emotions that we feel. This treatment is, in part, to ensure that anyconsciousness which incarnates into these bloodlines with the aim of removingtheir power, will find it almost impossible to manifest its true self. Thosechosen for programming are usually very intelligent because people with lowintelligence and creativity have been found to be almost impossible to programto the level required. Springmeier and Wheeler say that at the age of three theElite Brotherhood children selected for later advancement into the hierarchy aretaken before the Grand Druid Council and formal approval is given at apresentation by the Queen Mother of the Council. Interesting how George Bushtold Cathy O’Brien that Madeleine Albright, the US Ambassador to the UnitedNations and Secretary of State, was the ‘Reverend Mother of all slaves’. Istress again that this Grand Druid Council has nothing whatsoever to do with themany thousands of people who call themselves Druids today and they are notconnected with these events in any way. We need to understand that the use of aname by the Brotherhood does not mean that everyone using that name is involved.Most of the Druids I have met in Britain are lovely people with love in theirhearts and I have no desire to cast condemnation on them. Quite the opposite.The most preferred candidates for programming are fittingly, like Cathy O’Brien,blond-haired and blue-eyed ‘Caucasians’ who are not physically defective in anyway. The Brotherhood bloodlines are not only those which carry the names of theclassic bloodline families. The Brotherhood also use ‘breeders’, women who givebirth to their unofficial children. They use ‘brooder’ families where women bearBrotherhood children, or rear children from the time they are babies, who areconnected to classic bloodline families, although there appears to be norelationship. Children are swapped, sent to foster parents (like Sir FrancisBacon), or mothers suddenly ‘give birth’ when no-one even knew they werepregnant, which, of course, they weren’t. This allows Brotherhood bloodlinemembers to be placed in the positions of power in politics, banking, business,the media and the military, without there being an outcry from the public thatthe same families are in all the positions of control.Those who are not put through the birth trauma and programmed from the womb haveto begin their ‘preparation’ before the age of six because this type ofprogramming is more difficult after that. Some are still brought into theprogramme after that age, but this is rare. These children are put through evenmore gruesome torture to break down their developing minds. The programmers findout what phobias and fears the children have and use those to terrify them. Thisincludes putting children in dark confined places with spiders and snakes. Thechildren are told that if they ‘play dead’ the snakes and spiders won’t bitethem, so encouraging them to dissociate. Putting them in coffins emphasisesthat. They are forced to kill and eat other children and they are immersed inexcrement, urine, and blood. Most of the slave children will have experiencedall these things and more by the age of four or five.93[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274618] One common sign of programming orchildhood sexual abuse are eating disorders like bulimia. That is not to saythat all bulimia is caused by that, of course not, but it is a regularoccurrence in ritually abused and mind controlled people, as is attemptedsuicide and self mutilation. Finding it difficult to hold a stable relationshipis another and so is a squint in the left eye. Cathy O’Brien says she wastortured by having a needle pushed into her eye. This eye trauma, and sometimesthe insertion of a microchip behind the left eye, is quite common. Baron Guy deRothschild has a drooping left eye. He is a major slave handler and programmer,but he would have been put through childhood trauma as part of his preparationfor his role in the Brotherhood. The programmers create monsters and then thosemonsters create the next generation of monsters while the whole thing iscontrolled by the reptilians. The idea is to break the children’s spirit so theywill do exactly as they are told without question. That is precisely the aim andthe methods of the British public school system and its like around the world, asystem which, like the deeper mind-programming projects, are turning out theleaders and administrators who run the world to the Brotherhood reptilianAgenda.The false memory scamWhen Cathy O’Brien and thousands around the world began to recover theirmemories of abuse, the authorities retaliated with an organisation called theFalse Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) which has sought to discredit theirstories. It began in the United States in 1992, fronted by Pamela Freyd and herhusband, Peter, a mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, who have bothbeen accused by their daughter, Jennifer, of abusing her as a child. Branches ofthe False Memory Syndrome Foundation have appeared in other countries, includingthe UK, and, as a result, many journalists have written deeply destructivearticles dismissing the memories of mind control and ritual abuse victims asillusions. The FMSF claim that the victims of abuse are suffering from falsememories and are not remembering what really happened. Of course this canhappen, but the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is not satisfied with ‘some’.It wants all of them to be dismissed in this way, which is utter nonsense. Ithas hounded responsible therapists, accusing them of putting the memories intotheir clients minds. Why the therapists would want to do that has not beenexplained, nor how those people who have never forgotten their childhood sexualand Satanic abuse could be suffering from a false memory. A FMSF ‘scientific’adviser, Doctor Harold Merskey, testified in court that a woman claiming thather doctor sexually abused her as a child might be suffering from false memorysyndrome, when the doctor had already been struck off for previous paedophileactivities he had admitted. Merskey had not even examined the woman and said hisconclusion came from observing her in the court!One of the leaders of the FMSF, Doctor Ralph Underwager, was forced out when itwas revealed publicly that he and his wife, Hollida Wakefield, had given aninterview to a Dutch paedophile magazine called Paedika in 1993, in which hesaid that sex with children was “An acceptable expression of God’s will forlove”. Three members of the Advisory Board of the False Memory SyndromeFoundation in the United States have been Doctor Martin Orne, a notorious CIAmind controller at the University of Pennsylvania; Doctor Louis Jolyon ‘Jolly’West at the University of California, another infamous CIA mind controller(featured, like Orne, in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free); and, I read, JamesRandi, a magician known as The Amazing Randi. Amazing indeed to hear a tape ofhim, as I have, propositioning teenage boys for sex and boasting about his ‘nineinch willy’. Or maybe that tape and the transcript in my file is a false memory.Randi has also been used to discredit psychic powers and phenomena through aludicrous organisation called the Committee for the Investigation of Claims ofthe Paranormal or CSICOP. This is headed by Paul Kurtz, the chairman ofPrometheus Books, which publishes the works of James Randi and books aboutchildren’s sexual encounters with adults. Kurtz is Professor emeritus ofPhilosophy at New York State University in Buffalo. Another member of CSICOP,Vern Bullough, the Professor at the Faculty of Natural and Social Science at theUniversity of New York, is the ‘Human Sexuality’ Editor at Prometheus Books. Heis also a board member of Paedika, the Dutch paedophile magazine whichinterviewed Ralph Underwager of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. A numberof people are board members of both FMSF and CSICOP. What a web we weave.Discrediting psychic phenomena, life after death, or the memories of childhoodritual abuse, its all the same to these guys. And what do both organisationshave in common? They serve the Brotherhood Agenda by suppressing the exposure ofthe mind control and ritual abuse networks and the knowledge of the true natureof life. I am also staggered sometimes by the ‘research’ of some ‘conspiracywriters’ who dismiss the existence of Project Monarch and the highly detailedand documented work of people like Springmeier and Wheeler. If you read suchauthors in the light of the evidence presented here and elsewhere, one wondersif these ‘conspiracy writers’ are merely poor reseachers or part of the agendato lead people away from the truth. One writer comes to mind immediately whoturns out ‘conspiracy’ books full of old information with no original researchand yet dismisses the detailed documentation and personal experience ofSpringmeier and Wheeler. He has since done the same with an hysterical attack onthis book.How easy it has been to keep people in ignorance by destroying the true recordsof the reptilian involvement in human history and by selling a version of lifethat is a perversion of the truth. It means that people are so divorced fromreality that even when they are given the true, or truer, picture of the world,most people either laugh at the reptilian information or go into a state ofcomplete denial over Satanism and mind control. “They wouldn’t do that”, I hearpeople say. Oh yes they would, and they do, and they are doing it to someonenow. The reptilians can continue with the global dictatorship in all itsgrotesque forms because most people aren’t bothered what is going on in theworld and who is controlling their lives and those of their children. They areso pressured by debt and fear that they keep their heads down and their eyesclosed; or they are more concerned at the price of beer, the latest ‘scandal’ onthe television soaps, or how their soccer team is doing. Michael Aquino, theSatanist at the US government’s Psychological Warfare Department, once toldCathy O’Brien: “95 per cent want to be led by the other five per cent and the 95per cent do not want to know what is really going on in government”. How sadthat this is actually true. Anyone who still believes that the outcome of soccermatches or the price of beer is really important in the wider picture of life onthis planet, might benefit from reading the following. It is an account inCathy’s own words of what happened to her child, Kelly, again and again:“Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush’s‘neighbourhood’ and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter. Sheran 104–6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilising headaches for anaverage of three days (as is consistent with high voltage trauma). These werethe only tell-tale evidences aside from the scaring burns left on her skin.Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me to comfort her,pitifully complaining that her head ‘hurt too bad even to move’. And she did notmove for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain and herrectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My own mindcontrol victimisation rendered me unable to help or protect her. Seeing my childin such horrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in deeper,perpetuating my total inability to affect her needs until our rescue by MarkPhillips in 1988.“Kelly’s bleeding rectum was… one of (the)… physical indicators of George Bush’spaedophile perversions. I have overheard him speak blatantly of his sexual abuseof her on many occasions. He used this and threats to her life to ‘pull mystrings’ and control me. The psychological ramifications of being raped by apaedophile president are mind shattering enough, but reportedly Bush furtherreinforced his traumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASA electronic anddrug mind control devices. Bush also instilled the ‘who ya gonna call?’ and‘I’ll be watching you’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing her sense ofhelplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a child now seemtrite in comparison to the brutal physical and psychological devastation thatGeorge Bush inflicted on my daughter.”94[../Text/index_split_041.html#filepos1274708]Come on gang, I know this chapter must have been terribly hard to read, but it’stime to wake up.

They are obsessed with theirrituals and symbols because of their reptilian brain and I cannot overstressthis point. It is a means through which they can be tracked and read.Their most used symbols is the lighted torch, the symbol of knowledge and theSun. When an initiate reaches a certain level in the pyramid they are said to be‘illuminated’, more symbolism of the lighted torch. One of the recurring storiesin the ancient world is of a hero figure who takes fire (knowledge) from the‘gods’ and gives it to the people – the chosen few people, that is. The Watchers(extraterrestrials) called Azazel and Shemyaza were among those who gaveadvanced knowledge to humans, according to the Book of Enoch. The most famoussymbol of these Watchers is the Greek god, Prometheus, who was said to haveemerged from the Caucasus Mountains. In many ways he was another ‘Jesus’ figurewho died for the people and it is not inconceivable that the story of Jesus wasinspired, in part, by the legend of Prometheus. At the Rockefeller Center in NewYork today is a gold statue of Prometheus (gold, the solar metal of the gods)and he is holding the light, the fire, in line with the legend (see picturesection). To the Rockefellers this is not just a statue, it is a symbol of thewhole scam they are involved in. The Statue of Liberty is another Brotherhoodsymbol highlighting the lighted torch. The Statue of Liberty is actually theStatue of Liberties – the liberties perpetrated on the American people by theBrotherhood. There she stands on her island in New York Harbour holding hertorch of ‘freedom’ and Americans believe she is the symbol of their liberty inthe Land of the Free. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Statue ofLiberty was given to New York by French Freemasons and her mirror image standson an island in the River Seine in Paris (see picture section for this and othersymbols in this chapter). These statues of liberty are representations of QueenSemiramis and Isis et al, with the rays of the Sun around her head. The ancientssymbolised the Sun in this way. And they are not holding the torch of liberty,but the torch of the illuminated ones, the reptile-Aryan Elite. The Statue ofLiberty is a Brotherhood symbol which says: “We control this country and we aretelling you so, but you are too stupid to see it!” The torch is the most obviousBrotherhood signature.When the Brotherhood assassinated President Kennedy in 1963, they put a lightedtorch, the eternal flame which has burned to this day, on his grave in theArlington Cemetery. After the murder in Dallas the Freemasons erected an obeliskin Dealey Plaza a few yards from the spot where Kennedy was shot. At the topthey placed a depiction of the lighted torch. When Diana, Princess of Wales, wasmurdered in the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel in Paris, the ‘shrine’ to her, wherepeople left flowers, was a large gold symbol of the very ‘eternal’ flame held bythe two Statues of Liberty, which just happened to be on top of the tunnel whereher car crashed into the 13th pillar. Just a coincidence! On the island whereshe is said to be buried, they have placed yet another depiction of a lightedtorch. The Brotherhood are telling us that they killed Kennedy and Diana, butunless you understand their symbolic language, you don’t know. The lighted torchin the Olympic Games has the same meaning. I have to laugh when I see thedifferent cities holding their breath to see which of them has been selected tohold the next Olympics. It was all decided years before, in line with what ismost appropriate to the Brotherhood Agenda and its symbolism. You would havethought that the centenary Olympic Games would have been held in its originalhome of Greece, but instead it was given to Atlanta. Why the hell Atlanta,especially when the United States had only recently hosted the games in LosAngeles? One reason for this decision by the symbol-obsessed Brotherhood was thesymbolism of the legendary, Atlanta, the goddess and huntress, who was said tobe such a great athlete that no man could beat her. Everyone she defeated in arace had to suffer death and many were killed before one managed to trick herinto losing a race by dropping golden apples to divert her attention. It wassaid that she and her bridegroom were turned into lions and pulled the chariotof the Great Mother of the Gods.1 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1327429]The Olympic Games in Atlanta also allowed multimillions to be spent on roads andinfrastructure in a city reported to be a major centre for the New World Orderafter the Millennium.Another key Brotherhood symbol is the pyramid or the pyramid with the capstonemissing. The street plan of Dealey Plaza where Kennedy was killed is shaped likea pyramid with the capstone missing and Dealey actually means ‘Goddess Line’ asin Dea (goddess) and ley (ley line). The pyramid with the capstone missing, orthe pyramid and all seeing eye, is most famously depicted on the reverse of theGreat Seal of the United States and the dollar bill. The all seeing eye is theeye of Horus, Lucifer, Satan, whatever name you want to use, and also relates tothe so-called ‘third eye’, the chakra vortex in the centre of the foreheadthrough which we connect with our psychic sight. According to Egyptian legend,Osiris was murdered by Set and Set was killed by Horus who lost an eye in theprocess, hence the Eye of Horus. It also symbolises the reptilians looking intothis world from the lower fourth dimension and if you look at a magnification ofthe eye in Figure 28 (overleaf) you will see that the skin texture even looksreptilian. The 33rd degree Freemason and Black Nobility president, FranklinDelano Roosevelt (Ramses-Piso-Bush), had this symbol printed on the dollar billfrom 1933. It was a symbol of secret societies in Europe long before anyoneheard of the United States and it is awash with Freemasonic and secret societysymbolism going back to the ancient world (see Figure 29). The number of statesin America at the time of independence, 13, was no coincidence. Thirteen, thesacred twelve and one, is an ancient mystical number as we have seen throughoutthis book. On the two sides of the Great Seal you find 13 stars above the headof the eagle. The motto E Pluribus Unum has 13 letters, as does Annuit Coeptis.The eagle holds 13 leaves with 13 berries in its right talon and 13 arrows inthe left. There are 72 stones (another mystic number) on the pyramid arranged in13 rows. The eagle evolved from the symbol of the phoenix, the sacred Sun birdof the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians and the Native American version is thethunderbird. Manly P. Hall says that the original seal included the phoenix andit is known that one design for the Great Seal submitted by William Barton in1782 included a phoenix sitting on a nest of flames.2[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1327573] The symbol of the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry is the double eagle with a head looking in both directions – thesymbol of Nimrod.[../Images/00077.jpg]Figure 28: The All Seeing Eye on the dollar bill. Is the skin reptilian?This same symbol appears in at least two portraits of George Washington. Theeagle is a widely used Brotherhood symbol and it can be found on the coats ofarms of many countries, including Egypt, Libya and Iraq. It was a major symbolfor the Nazis in Germany and it appears in the designs of pulpits and lecternsused by the Christian Church. Seals like the one used in the Great Seal of theUnited States can be traced back to at least 4,000 BC in Egypt, Babylon, Assyriaand India. Our old friends, in other words. The first English Royal pendant sealwas that of Edward the Confessor, who ruled between 1042 and 1066. This became amodel for all future British and American seals.The Latin words above and below the pyramid on the Great Seal/dollar billannounce the arrival of a new secular order. The New World Order is the insidername for the Brotherhood Agenda and George Bush used the term profusely when hewas president. The date written in Latin on the bottom of the pyramid, 1776, isthought, understandably, to relate to the American Declaration of Independencein that year. But something else happened on May 1st (a date beloved bySatanists) in that same year of 1776. A very significant strand in theBrotherhood network was officially launched called the Bavarian Illuminati bythe German professor, Adam Weishaupt. This was quite a year for the Brotherhoodbecause also in 1776 the House of Rothschild was formerly founded and theBrotherhood-controlled economist from Scotland, Adam Smith, published his highlyinfluential work, The Wealth Of Nations. Like I say, dates matter to thesepeople because they represent energy flows and cycles. Weishaupt used hisIlluminati to further infiltrate Freemasonry. Weishaupt was trained as a Jesuit,the Society of Jesus. The founder of the Jesuits, the Spaniard Ignatius Loyola,formed a secret society within this apparently ‘Catholic’ order and theinitiates were called the Alumbrados, the ‘enlightened’, the ‘illuminated’.Weishaupt created 13 degrees of initiation in his Illuminati (the same as thenumber of levels on the Great Seal pyramid) and the key personnel were to befound in the top nine degrees. Many people get confused between the Illuminati(the network that spans thousands of years) and the Bavarian Illuminati, whichwas just one significant secret society within the network.[../Images/00080.jpg]Figure 29: The Pyramid and All Seeing Eye, the ancient Brotherhood symbol, onthe dollar bill and the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States.The obelisk and the dome are common sights in the monuments and buildings of theBrotherhood. The obelisk is an ancient phallic symbol of the male energy andsolar energy and the dome represents the female or moon energy. Often they areplaced together or close to each other. This is the symbolism of the Oval Office(the womb, female) in the White House which looks out on the WashingtonMonument, the vast stone obelisk (phallic, male). These symbols attract andgenerate the energy they represent: they are a physical thought form. Theobelisk also symbolises the penis of the Egyptian Sun god, Osiris. According tolegend, after Osiris had been sliced into pieces by his rival, Set, the QueenIsis found all the pieces except his willy. Credo Mutwa details a similar storyrelated to the penis of the chief of the Chitauri reptilians in African legends.An obelisk claimed to come from Alexandria in Egypt stands in Central Park, NewYork, and its twin was erected in the 19th century, during the reign of QueenVictoria (Ramses-Piso-Bush), on the former Templar lands alongside the RiverThames not far from the Houses of Parliament. It is known as Cleopatra’s Needle(Cleopatra = Ramses-Piso-Bush) and originally stood in On (Heliopolis), theEgyptian City of the Sun, from at least 1500 BC, before it was moved toAlexandria (see picture section). A sphinx has been placed on either side at itsLondon location. Another Egyptian obelisk which was built in Luxor 3,200 yearsago now stands in the Place de Concorde in Paris, less than a minute’s drivefrom the scene of Diana’s crash.On the other side of the crash scene is the Eiffel Tower, another giganticobelisk in disguise. The Washington Monument in Washington DC is a colossalobelisk. The dome (from a Greek word meaning Place of the Gods) draws in andharnesses energy, as does the pyramid. So often you find that the greatcathedrals are built around a massive dome because their builders and designersunderstood the power of geometry to focus energy in one spot. The vast goldendome on the ‘Islamic’ shrine on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the dome of StPeter’s at the Vatican in Rome, and the Church of Santa Maria which dominatesthe skyline of Florence, are obvious examples of this. Look around the majorBrotherhood cities and you will find they have at least one major domedbuilding. In the City of London you have St Paul’s Cathedral designed by theinitiate Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire of London had destroyed theoriginal city. The mirror of St Paul’s Cathedral is in Paris and known as thePantheon. Look at the Congress building in Washington DC and you will find thatit is another St Paul’s (see picture section). In London’s Leicester Squarethere is a dome-shaped skylight with concentric circles in the strangely namedNotre-Dame de France built in 1865 on a site with Knights Templar associationsand rebuilt in the late 1950s.3 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1327701]The building includes a stone slab from Chartres Cathedral and a mural of thecrucifixion scene, full of occult symbolism and sacred geometry, by the Frenchartist Jean Cocteau (1889–1963), a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. His muralincludes a black sun, a classic Brotherhood symbol, casting its rays into thesky, and a man with an eye drawn in the shape of a fish, which could well besymbolic of the Babylonian Nimrod. In Rome there is the dome at the Vatican,that ancient site of Mithra (Sun) worship, and alongside the dome you findobelisks in St. Peter’s Square. In London the Millennium Dome has been builtnext to the Greenwich zero longitude time-line which runs through the nearbyGreenwich Observatory, which was also, incidentally, designed by Sir ChristopherWren. It is to this point in the world that all the watches, clocks, and timezones (therefore the collective human mind) are tuned and we view the universefrom the same time-perspective. The measurement used in the Greenwich time-gridis solar time. On the other side of the River Thames, opposite the MillenniumDome, is the biggest building and obelisk in Europe, the Canary Wharf building.Again in the Brotherhood cities you will invariably find a skyscraper shapedlike an obelisk because of the effect that has on the energy field and theharnessing of solar energy. Big Ben, the famous clock at the Houses ofParliament in Westminister, is also an obelisk. The word ben is Cymric andGaelic for mountain and in ancient Egypt ‘Ben’ related to the sacred ben benstone on the top of the pillars in On, the city of the Sun. These pillars becamesymbolised by the obelisk and it was said to be the point where the godsdescended to the Earth. The bennu bird – the inspiration for the Phoenix – saton the ben ben stone, according to legend.4[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1327812] There is also another significancefor the Millennium Dome and Canary Wharf which I will explain later.The street plans of major cities are designed under the laws of sacred geometryin the same way that the great cathedrals, temples and stone circles were. Aswith the City of London after the Great Fire of 1666, the new city of WashingtonDC was designed according to these laws. Symbols, shapes and angles generatedifferent energies and if you understand these principles you can vibrate theenergy field of a place to the vibrational range you deem most suitable for whatyou wish to achieve there. Anyone living or working within that field will beaffected by it. You can also focus solar and other astrological energies in thatplace.I found Washington one of the most unpleasant energies I have ever encounteredoutside the Square Mile in the City of London. A French Freemason, Major PierreCharles L’Enfant, was engaged to create the new Washington, and his work wasbased on plans officially prepared by leaders like Thomas Jefferson and GeorgeWashington (both Ramses-Piso-Bush), although others with greater esotericunderstanding would have been the real architects. Jefferson, however, had deepesoteric connections and when he died a code system which was very similar toancient Rosicrucian secret manuscripts was found among his possessions by theRosicrucian, Spencer Lewis.5 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1327936] Someresearchers say Jefferson was a Grand Master of the Rosicrucians. He was anexpert in astronomy and astrology, as was Benjamin Franklin who wrote abest-seller on the subject called Poor Richard’s Almanac. L’Enfant had fought inthe War of Independence and he, like Washington, was a member of the highlysecretive and exclusive grouping called the Society of Cincinnati. It wasofficially a secret society for American and French officers in the War ofIndependence and it introduced hereditary membership which is passed on to theeldest son. Washington was its president for life. The diary entries ofWashington and letters by Jefferson relating to L’Enfant and the street planhave ‘disappeared’. L’Enfant was dismissed after a year, but the street plancontinued. In 1909 his remains were exhumed and taken by military escort toCapitol Hill to lie ‘in State’ for just three hours. Thousands went to pay theirrespects and he was reburied at the Arlington National Cemetery. What goes on?The Arlington Cemetery was formerly the grounds of Vernon House the home ofGeorge Washington and the American Order of the Knights Templar hold theirannual sunrise ceremonies in the amphitheatre there.6[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328227]Forty boundary posts were established a mile apart to mark the boundary of theten square miles of Washington and in the centre was built the Congressbuilding, Capitol Hill, named after the sacred place of the Roman secretsocieties called Capitoline Hill. It was no surprise, therefore, that the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, the high priestess of Americanpolitics, should make a pilgrimage to Capitoline Hill on her first officialvisit to Europe after her appointment. Capitol Hill is not a political building,it is a temple to the Satanic Brotherhood and underneath its ‘St Paul’s’ dome isa crypt room. Beneath the floor of the crypt, marked by a pentagram star, is avacant tomb. They say this was meant for George Washington, who decided to beburied elsewhere, but there is more to it than that. The bodies of Kennedy,Lincoln, McKinley, Garfield, Harding, Taft, Hoover, Wilson, Stevens, Dewey,Pershing, MacArthur, L’Enfant and two unknown soldiers have all been placed onthe catafalque found in the tomb.7 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328316]A catafalque for those, like me, who had never heard the word, is the structureon which the body is carried during a funeral procession or placed on for lyingin state. The same format of a tomb under a dome is the ‘tomb of St Peter’beneath the Basilica at the Vatican. The Congress building is a temple to asecret society which, under many names, originates in the ancient world. Withinthe Washington street plan, centred on Capitol Hill and the White House, areastrological symbols (which relate exactly to where certain constellationsappear in the sky), hexagrams, Satanic pentagrams, squares, a Masonic compass, a‘Spear of Destiny’, a skull and bones and scores of others. For more informationand illustrations I strongly recommend an excellent book by Charles L. WestbrookJr called The Talisman Of The United States, Signature Of The InvisibleBrotherhood. Roads in Washington relate to the points where the Sun rises at thewinter and summer solstice, just as the ancient mounds, temples and stonecircles like Stonehenge, were designed to do (see Figure 30). Other streetscross at precisely 33 degrees and still others mark the precession of theequinoxes, and there is a hexagram or Star of David (see Figure 31).[../Images/00081.jpg]Figure 30: The street plan of Washington DC, like all the major Brotherhoodcities, is a mass of esoteric symbolism. Key buildings, like Congress, aredesigned to mark the places the Sun rises and sets at the winter and summersolstice. There is also a hexagram or Star of David – Figure 31.I described earlier how the Elite of America and further afield gather at theBohemian Grove in Northern California and take part in ceremonies under a 40foot stone owl. The owl is symbolic of Moloch or Molech, the ancient deity towhich children were, and are, sacrificed. Another symbol of Moloch is thehexagram or Star of David which is the family symbol of the Rothschilds. TheSumerian goddess, Lilith, known as the Lady of the Breasts, was also symbolisedas an owl.8 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328405] Lilith is symbolic ofthe bloodline. The Pagan religions knew her as the enchantress. In the picturesection you will see the ‘grovers’ performing a ceremony at Bohemian Grovebefore the giant owl. How interesting that when I was looking at a map ofWashington I found that the roads within the grounds of the Congress Buildingmake the very clear symbol of… an owl! You also find that the owl is sitting ona pyramid. The pyramid and all seeing owl (see Figure 32). The same owl symbolcan be found hidden on the dollar bill if you know where to look and you have avery powerful magnifying glass. I also understand a new pedestrianisation schemearound Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, is going to look like an owlfrom above. There are at least three Satanic pentagrams in the Washington streetplan. By ‘Satanic’, I mean pentagrams pointing downwards or with the lines madeof different lengths to distort the shape. These reverses and distortions of thepentagram are Satanic signatures in the same way that the Nazis reversed theswastika. One pentagram points down into Capitol Hill (see Figure 33 overleaf ),another into the White House (see Figure 34 overleaf ), and a third extends outfrom the giant obelisk called the Washington Monument and covers a large area ofthe inner city. At its centre is the sign for Aries, the ram or lamb. SimilarSatanic pentagrams can be identified in the street plan of Rome, the old city ofJerusalem, the land around Rennes-le-Chateau, the pyramid site at Giza, and nodoubt over London and other cities and sites. Across the Potomac River fromWashington is the home of the United States military – the Pentagon Buildingwhich was aligned to the constellation of Taurus.9[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328552] A pentagon, of course, is thecentre of a pentagram. If you drive through the centre of the White Housepentagram you come to a remarkable building at 1733 16th Street. Note thenumber: 1733. The number 17 recurs over and over in the story ofRennes-le-Chateau, and 33 is the official number of degrees in the ScottishRite. This building has the feel of an Egyptian temple with two depictions ofthe Sphinx outside and a massive image of the rising Sun (Horus). A similarsymbol was on the ‘sun chair’ of George Washington. This strange building is theSupreme Headquarters of the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. The33rd degree is known as the Revolutionary Degree and most heads of governmentare 33rd degree Freemasons even though they will be keen to deny this or keep itquiet. It is an honorary degree and they will have made an oath of loyalty toFreemasonry that overrides their oath to their nation. In the garden behind thisbuilding I saw through the hedge a bust of George Washington celebrating him asthe first Freemason President of the United States. This building is home to thebiggest collection of Freemason relics in the world (and that’s only themembers).[../Images/00083.jpg]Figure 32: The Pyramid and All Seeing Owl. The roadways within the Congressgrounds and the two main thoroughfares leading away create an owl sitting on apyramid around the Congress Building. The owl is symbolic of Moloch, to whomchildren have been sacrificed for thousands of years.[../Images/00085.jpg]Figure 33: The inverted and distorted pentagrams in the Washington streets, onepoints into Congress……the other into the White House – Figure 34.[../Images/00088.jpg]In the Smithsonian Museum, just down from the White House, there is a remarkablemarble statue of George Washington which was once displayed at Capitol Hill. Itwas commissioned by Congress in the 19th century and sculptured in Florence,Italy, by Horatio Greenough. When the statue was unloaded at the Washington NavyYard in 1840, people were horrified at what they saw. Washington was depictedsitting in a chair, naked to the waist, with a sheet laid across his netherregions. General Henry Wise, the Virginia statesman, remarked that: “The mandoes not live, and never did live, who saw Washington without his shirt”.10[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328677] So why portray him like that? Andwhy was his right hand pointing up and his left hand pointing down? If you lookagain at Figure 21 (page 155) you will understand. They made the statue in theimage of Baphomet of Mendes or Asmodeus, the Satanists’ symbol of the ‘Devil’.Asmodeus is said to have been the guardian of Solomon’s Treasure and a portrayalof him was found among the possessions of Abbe Sauniere, the mysterious priestat Rennes-le-Chateau who placed a statue of Asmodeus at the entrance to hischurch. Asmodeus is named as the chief demon in the Hebrew Talmud. A painting ofWashington by ‘Caduceus’ is a mass of esoteric symbolism and geometry. Twoexamples are that his hand is raised at the angle of the rising moon and hissword is at the angle of the Sun at the winter solstice.11[../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328767][../Images/00089.jpg]Figure 35: The ancient sun, circle, and cross symbol and it is portrayed in...Figure 36: The Celtic Cross, Figure 37: The NATO logo and Figure 38: The crossand sun of the CIA badge.The Washington street design has been expanded over the years, but this has beendone in keeping with a plan which appears to have been decided at the start. Thesame thing seems to have happened with some structures in the ancient world,most notably the site at Giza. The Jefferson and Lincoln memorials were added tothe Washington street plan in the early 20th century. The Jefferson building,historians believe, is based on a design of the Pantheon in Rome. Like all ofthese key buildings, they are built alongside water or ‘reflecting pools’. Thebuilding represents the Sun and the water is the Moon reflecting the Sun. TheWashington monument, at 555 feet, the biggest stone obelisk in the world, wascompleted in 1885. The cornerstone had been laid by the Grand Freemasons Lodgeof the District of Columbia. While travelling and speaking in the United StatesI saw a television item which said the authorities intended to build a memorialin the Mall, the heart of the street plan, to those who died in the Second WorldWar. It would include at its centre, they said, a depiction of a lighted torch.The locations of the cities and centres of the Brotherhood relate to placeswhere solar and other cosmic energy can be most powerfully harnessed. Charles L.Westbrook Jr, the author of The Talisman Of The United States, received someanonymous correspondence after his book was published. It consisted of a map ofthe USA and a piece of paper on which were written the words: “It’s bigger thanyou think.”12 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328857] Lines drawn on themap revealed similar geometry to that in Washington, but on a much larger scale.Some of the points connecting the geometry, or highlighted by it, were MountVernon, Illinois; Miami, which was dubbed the ‘magic city’ as early as 1820; anda place called Pike’s Peak in Jefferson County, Colorado, just across the borderfrom Arkansas.The ancient symbol of the circle and the cross I described a few chapters back,is still used today in the secret language. It is the one symbolising the Sun’sprogress through the 12 months and the 12 signs of the zodiac, the cross andcircle with the Sun on the cross (see Figure 35). This has inspired the Celticcross (see Figure 36), the logo of NATO, the world-army-in-waiting (see Figure37), and the emblem of the CIA (see Figure 38). In the City of London financialdistrict opposite St Paul’s Cathedral, I also found the symbol in Figure 39(overleaf ). It is a zodiac circle with a black sun at the centre. This buildingwas designed originally for the Financial Times newspaper and the face on theblack sun is that of Winston Churchill. The black sun is more reverse symbolismwhich indicates the negative use of solar energy and the galactic sun aroundwhich the solar system orbits. The Nazis also spoke of the black sun. I feel theblack horse symbol of that Brotherhood operation, Lloyds Bank, is a similarcode. The white horse was a Phoenician Sun symbol. This same symbol of thecircle and the cross was used by the Phoenicians and can be seen in theirdepictions of their goddess Barati, as it can on the shield in her Britishversion, Britannia. The street plan of Paris, dominated by the Arc or ‘arch’ deTriomphe, is the same symbolism. The arch itself is a Brotherhood symbol. It isthe meaning behind the name of the Royal Arch lodges in the York Rite ofFreemasonry and relates in part to the key stone at the top which holds the archtogether and gives it strength. The earliest record of such a lodge is in theannals of the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 22nd 1753.Fredericksburg was the location of the House of the Rising Sun, the Masonicmeeting place where people like Benjamin Franklin, George Washington and otherFounding Fathers used to gather. The arch symbolism of Freemasonry is also theinspiration for a vast concrete arch at St Louis, Missouri. The Arc de Triompheis placed at the centre of a circle from which 12 roads go out across Paris. Onthe road circle around the Arc de Triomphe are 12 points on the road making a12-pointed star. Again the sun at the centre of the circle broken up into 12segments (see picture section). The main road going through this pattern is thefamous Champs Elysees and when you follow this line you can see how planned itall is. When you stand underneath the Arc de Triomphe next to the ‘eternalflame’ of the unknown soldier, look in one direction, dead straight, and you seea big modern concrete arch in the distance. When you turn and look the otherway, again dead straight, you look down the Champs Elysees to the 3,200 year oldEgyptian obelisk in the Place de Concorde. Beyond that in the same direct lineyou find another arch, similar to the Arc de Triomphe, but much smaller, andthat, in turn, is in direct line with the big black glass pyramid built outsidethe Louvre Museum during the presidency of the 33rd degree Freemason, FrancoisMitterrand. People were flabbergasted that anyone could build such anout-ofkeeping structure alongside the beautiful architecture of the Louvre. Thereason had nothing to do with architecture and everything to do with adding morepower to the geometrical design of the city. A similar and vast black pyramidhas been built with a massive Sphinx and an obelisk in that Brotherhood city,Las Vegas.[../Images/00091.jpg]Figure 39: The sun and zodiac circle at the entrance to a financial building inthe City of London, near St Paul’s Cathedral in the heart of the BrotherhoodSpider’s Web. The Black Sun represents the malevolent use of solar energy andthe ‘galactic Sun’, and this one includes the face of Winston Churchill.The lion is seen so often in heraldry and flags because it is an ancient symbolof the Sun, as is the Sphinx most probably. The fish symbolises the sign ofPisces and also the legendary King of Babylon, Nimrod, who was depicted as afish. The dove symbolises his partner, Queen Semiramis, and it is more reversesymbolism. While the dove means peace to most people, it symbolises death anddestruction to the Brotherhood. This reversing allows them to use their symbolsin the public eye in a way that no-one understands. Sinn Fein, the politicalwing of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland, has a dove as its symbol forthis reason. It is this dove symbolism which gives us the fictitious name ofChristopher Columbus who in fact used to sign his name Colon. The name Columbuswas invented as yet more Brotherhood symbolism. The Romans used to worship adeity they called Venus Columba, Venus the Dove. Venus and dove are associatedwith Queen Semiramis in Babylon. The word dove in French today is stillColombre. Columba is also an ‘Aphrodite’ goddess which symbolises the negative,death and destruction, aspects of the female energy. Hence we have BritishColumbia, Columbia Pictures, Columbia University, Columbia Broadcasting (CBS),the Space Shuttle Columbia, and District of Columbia in which they placedWashington DC. You’ve only got to look at some of the names for places aroundWashington to see where their originators were coming from. The most obvious isAlexandria just over the border from the District of Columbia, in Virginia (thevirgin – Isis, Semiramis). And, by the way, look at the logos of those Columbiaorganisations. Columbia Pictures has the lady holding the lighted torch,Columbia University has the lighted torch, and Columbia Broadcasting (CBS) hasthe eye, the all seeing eye. Doves can be seen standing on Maltese crosses onthe sceptres held by the Queen of England in her ceremonies and there areMaltese crosses on the crown of the British monarch (see picture section).Sceptres and rods were symbols of power in ancient Egypt. The Maltese or splayedcross (see Figure 40 overleaf ) was found in caves in the former Phoenicianlands of Cappadocia, now Turkey, dating back many thousands of years and itbecame the cross of the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem (Knights ofMalta), the Knights Templar, and the Nazis. If you look in the picture sectionat the Nazi soldier you will see that he has the whole set – the Maltese Cross,the reversed swastika, the skull and bones and the eagle! Three major symbols ofthe Brotherhood are the lighted torch, the red rose and the dove. The symbols ofthe three main political parties in the United Kingdom which serve the structureheaded by the Queen are the lighted torch (Conservatives), the red rose (Labour)and the dove (Liberal Democrats)! At the time of writing their three leaders areTony Blair (Bilderberg Group), William Haig (Bilderberg Group), and PaddyAshdown (Bilderberg Group). Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about.The laurel leaves in the United Nations symbol are mirrored by the Freemasons(see Figure 41 overleaf ) and there are 33 sections in the circle. The logo isblue, a Freemasonic colour, as in the Blue Degrees of Freemasonry. The symbol ofthe European Union is also blue. The inspiration for the ‘frame’ around the UNlogo can be easily seen in the Freemasons symbol in Figure 42. You find theblack and white squares of the Freemasons and the Templars (and endless otherBrotherhood groups) on the uniform of British and American police forces (andmany others), as well as on the floors of great cathedrals and the church atRennes-le-Chateau. When American presidents put their hand on their breast whilelistening to the national anthem they are performing part of Freemasonic ritual.Americans who oppose the Freemasons do the same because they don’t understandthe symbolism. Another hand signal for the Brotherhood is to put your arm in theair with the two outer fingers pointing upwards and the two middle fingers helddown by the thumb. This is the symbol of the Devil or Baphomet, the horns ofNimrod (the royal reptilians), and this is the sign that Bill Clinton made afterhis first inaugural speech as president in January, 1993. Baphomet is alsosymbolic of the Watcher-reptilian, Azazel, the ‘goat’. The double square, onesquare on top of another in any form, is more secret society symbolism. In thesecret language, one square by itself means control of what is right and just.From this we get phrases like “fair and square” and a “square deal”. One squareon top of another means control of all that is right and all that is wrong, allthat is just and all that is unjust, all that is positive and all that isnegative. In other words “we control everything”. The double square, or eightpointed star, can be seen in the lobby at the heart of the British Parliamentand a long list of world police forces surround their badge with the same symbol(see Figure 43). The chevron is another version of this (see Figure 44). Youneed to look at this as symbolic of two three-dimensional boxes, one above theother, and not as one-dimensional ‘ticks’. This is the logo of the Brotherhoodoil company, Chevron, and the other oil and transnational corporations are amaze of symbols featuring the secret language of the force which controls theworld. The double cross of the House of Lorraine is the origin of the phrase to‘double cross’ someone, to manipulate them. This same symbol can be found in theRockefeller-guided oil giant, Exxon (see Figures 45 and 46). Texaco has thepentagram inside a circle with the T square of Freemasonry (see Figure 47). Thesymbol of Atlantic Richfield Oil (ARCO) is a pyramid with the capstone missinglooked at from above (see Figure 48) and Amoco has the lighted torch (see Figure49). Look at the names of some of the Brotherhood’s insurance companies: SunAlliance, Sun Life, Britannic Assurance, Eagle Star. The Sun Alliance buildingin Piccadilly Circus, London, is decorated with two pillars, two flames, and astatue of Britannia (Barati) holding her circle and cross shield, the ancientSun symbol! Note also the names given to space craft, military aircraft, andnaval ships like Hermes, Nimrod, Atlantis, and Columbia. All symbolic to theBrotherhood.[../Images/00093.jpg]Figure 40: The Maltese Cross.[../Images/00096.jpg]Figure 41: The United Nations logo in Freemason blue with 33 sections within thecircle in line with the 33 official degrees of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.The ‘frame’ is also directly from Freemasonry as you can see in Figure 42.[../Images/00097.jpg]Figure 43: One square placed over another in any form means “we controleverything”. Appropriately we see that here in the badge of Sussex Police inEngland.[../Images/00050.jpg]Figure 44: Chevron. You need to look at this as a three-dimensional, not aone-dimensional image. There are two boxes, symbolising one square on top ofanother. We control everything.[../Images/00060.jpg]Figure 45: The double cross of the House of Lorraine which can be seen today inthe logo of the Exxon Oil Company – Figure 46.[../Images/00064.jpg]The Fleur-de-lis is another ancient symbol which is widely used today,particularly by royalty, and you find it on the fences around many buildings. Itcan be found on one of the gates to the White House. It was used by theMerovingians in France and, apart from its connection to them, it symbolises theBabylonian god Nimrod, and Lilith, the name symbolising the reptilian bloodline.The red rose is another Brotherhood signature and the bell, as in the AmericanLiberty Bell, is symbolic of Bel, Bil or Baal, the Aryan Sun god of the ancientworld. The most obvious symbol of the Brotherhood’s intent is the fasces, fromwhich we get the word, fascism. You can see it at the bottom of a United States‘liberty’ symbol and in the Congress Building (see Figure 50). It was a symbolused widely in the Roman Empire and it consists of rods bound together around anaxe. This axe is the origin of the term Axis Powers for the fascist countries inthe Second World War. The symbolism is of people and countries bound togetherunder a common centralised dictatorship, the axe. That is a perfect descriptionof the European Union in which the nations of Europe are subordinate to commonlaws decided and imposed by the unelected dictatorship in Brussels. The EuropeanUnion is truly a fascist state in accordance with the fascist symbol.[../Images/00070.jpg]Figure 47: Texaco. The pentagram in the circle with the Tau cross, the T-squareof Freemasonry.[../Images/00068.jpg]Figure 48: Atlantic Richfield Oil and the pyramid with the capstone missing seenfrom above.[../Images/00078.jpg]Figure 49: Amoco, now merged with British Petroleum. The lighted torch.[../Images/00082.jpg]Figure 50: Liberty? Then why the fascist symbols at the bottom which stand foranything but freedom.Another form of symbolism is known as reverse speech or word inversion. A greatdeal more research is being done into this today and it is one of the mysteriesheld by the Brotherhood since ancient time. Under this system, for instance, thecar hire company, Avis, becomes Siva, one of the gods in the Hindu triad ortrinity. The symbol of Siva is the penis and, like Neptune and Satan, Siva isusually pictured with a trident.13 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1328948]Avis, which is owned by the Brotherhood’s International Telephone and Telegraph,have formerly registered the words ‘Wizard’ and ‘Golden File’ as trademarks, asin ‘The Wizard of Avis’. Sun and sex rite symbolism is constantly used inadvertising by the Brotherhood corporations. These words and symbols communicatewith the human subconscious and affect people without them being aware of it.But symbolism does not have to be negative. It is simply a form of communicationand it has also been used to keep the knowledge alive by those who have apositive intent for humanity. Knowledge is neutral; it is the use of it that ispositive or negative. Tarot cards, the forerunner to our playing cards, wereused to pass on suppressed knowledge. Hence the reason why the church has socondemned the tarot cards and dubbed them evil. In the centuries which followedthe elimination of the Cathars in France, the Tarot was circulated by travellingentertainers and gypsies. Some researchers say the Tarot cards were introducedto Europe by the returning crusaders who had acquired them from mystical sectsin the Middle East and that is certainly true to an extent. But what is oftenforgotten is the role played by the gypsies and why they have been persecuted sooften, not least by Adolf Hitler. There is the legend, I believe based on truth,that priests from Alexandria saved whatever they could when the great esotericlibrary at Alexandria was burned by the Roman Church and they became wanderers,a people apart, with their own language and they symbolised their knowledge inthe Tarot. When gypsies are first mentioned in English records at the time ofHenry VIII, they are described as ‘outlandish people, calling themselvesEgyptians’.14 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1329062] The term, Tarot, isbelieved to be derived from two Egyptian words, Tar meaning road, and Ro meaningroyal.15 [../Text/index_split_043.html#filepos1329190] The royal road to wisdomif the knowledge is used properly and not malevolently. The Tarot consists ofthe Minor Arcana, four suits called swords (blade), cups (chalice), pentaclesand sceptres, and the Major Arcana or ‘Great Secrets’, known as trumps. Amongthe trumps was the ‘Joker’ which has survived in modern playing cards. The Jokeris the jester who used humour and clowning to pass on the message. The Jokeralso connects to the Trickster, a term you find in native American myth.Today’s playing cards are an abridged form of the Tarot. The colours black andred represent the two great divisions of the year, Winter and Summer, when theSun is in the north or south. The four suits are the seasons. The 13 cards ineach suit are the 13 lunar months of the year and the 52 cards in the deck arethe 52 weeks of the year. If you count the joker as one point and the Jack,Queen, King, as 11,12 and 13, the sum value of the 52 cards is 365, the days ofthe year. There is astrological symbolism in there, too. The highly symbolicgame of chess, the ‘royal game’, was played in China and India long before itarrived in Europe. A form of chess, more like draughts, was played by thePharaohs in Egypt. The chess board consists of 64 black and white squares,symbolising the floor of the House of Mysteries. The black and white chess‘teams’ symbolise the eternal battle between negative and positive, light anddark, among much else. The 64 squares on a chess board relate to the Chineseesoteric system known as the I Ching, which consists of 64 hexagrams. It is allthe same knowledge hidden or presented in different ways. The singers and songwriters known as the Troubadours of 12th and 13th century France sang thepraises of their ‘lady’. The name troubadour itself leads us back to NorthAfrica because it comes from the Arab term ‘tarab dour’, meaning House ofDelight, a remnant of the Muslim occupation of southern France. They hid their‘lady’ behind the biblical Mary in order to stay alive, but the true meaning oftheir ‘lady’ was Isis. Later would come the stories of King Arthur and hissearch for the Holy Grail, stories that would clearly echo the themes of theGospels, Mithra, Horus, etc., in their symbolism of the Sun, Isis and theastrological Round Table.There you have just some of the symbolism which non-initiates, or those who havenot taken the trouble to find out, simply cannot see. If you are new to thislanguage of symbolism, I hope that now you will be able to read more easily thesigns and signatures of the Brotherhood and therefore be more streetwise totheir games and aims."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos1279972] The Woman’s Encyclopaedia OfMyths And Secrets, pp 73-73.2 [../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos1282600] The Secret Teachings Of AllAges, p LXXXIX.3 [../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos1289051] The Templar Revelation, pp36-39.4 [../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos1290978] My thanks to Ivan Fraser forthis information.5 [../Text/index_split_042.html#filepos1292561] Charles L.

They are of a Black Nobility bloodline going back to Constantine theGreat, the Piso family, Alexander the Great and beyond. The Windsors areknowingly working to the Brotherhood Agenda and when you look behind the façadewhat you find is very dark indeed. They are the highest profile reptilian familyon the planet and they operate at the heart of the global manipulation. They arestill ‘gofers’ of a kind and not at the very top of the pyramid, but they areclose to those who are.The very coronation of the British monarch reveals the true background to theWindsors and their predecessors. When the Queen was crowned Elizabeth II on June2nd 1953, all the regalia of the ceremony, the crowns, sceptres, gowns, orb andbracelets, were taken from the Tower of London and kept overnight in theJerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey. This chamber is where the scholars metto translate the King James ‘authorised version’ of the Bible under the overallsupervision of Sir Francis Bacon and Robert Fludd, the Grand Master of thePriory of Sion.1 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1451528] The British Royalfamily still hold the copyright for this! The Jerusalem Chamber is panelled withcedar wood brought from the Lebanon because that was the wood said to be used tobuild Solomon’s Temple. The tapestry in the chamber depicts the Judgement ofSolomon. Westminster Abbey, the ‘Christian cathedral’, is in fact a Pagantemple. Even the floor is made of black and white squares like a Freemasonictemple.At the start of the ceremony in 1953, the Queen sat on the Coronation Chair andunder her bum was the Stone of Destiny which Edward I had stolen from Scone(pronounced ‘scoon’) Abbey in Scotland in 1246. The Stone was supposed to havebeen brought to Ireland from Israel via Egypt and is also known as Jacob’sPillar or Pillow. I think the basic theme of that is correct, but there is agreat deal more to know about the detail and its true significance. TheArchbishop of Canterbury turned to the north, south, east, and west (the fourpoints of the Pagan cross) and the congregation shouted “God save the Queen”.This was symbolic of the story in the Old Testament describing the crowning of‘Saul’ as King of Israel when people shouted “God save the King”.2[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1451700] This cry can be found eight timesin the Old Testament when the Kings of Israel are crowned. The Queen sat in theCoronation Chair holding the Egyptian symbols, a sceptre and a rod. On the topof the sceptre is the Maltese Cross and on the rod is a dove. She also laterholds an orb with a Maltese Cross on the top, the same as those used by theDutch wing of the Black Nobility. Babylon is now London and Queen Elizabeth isseen by the Brotherhood as a symbolic successor to the legendary founder ofBabylon, Queen Semiramis, who was symbolised as a ‘dove’. The Queen was alsoanointed with oil at her Coronation, the ancient Aryan and reptile-Aryantradition which goes back thousands of years. The word ‘Christ’ means the‘anointed one’. The oil at the Queen’s coronation was the same mixture as thatused in the ancient Middle East. It was carried in a gold vessel called theAmpulla made in the form of… a dove.3[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1451791] This is symbolic of the messeh fatused in Egypt by the Royal Court of the Dragon. The anointing at the Coronationis supposed to elevate the monarch to the rank of High Priest, in this case,appropriately, High Priestess of the Church of England as well as head of state.While this was happening, the Archbishop of Canterbury said:“As kings, priests, and prophets were anointed: and as Solomon was anointed byZadok the priest and Nathan the prophet, so be thou anointed, blessed andconsecrated Queen over the peoples, whom the Lord thy God hath given thee torule and govern… ”4 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1451906]This is pure Brotherhood symbolism. The ‘Lord thy God’ means the ‘gods’ of theancient world, the reptilian ‘gods’. The crown used in the ceremony goes back tothe time of Edward the Confessor. He was the King of England who built theoriginal Westminster Abbey in 1065 and later the present one was begun by theTemplar-controlled, Henry III (Ramses-Piso-Bush). Edward died in 1066, the veryyear that William the Conqueror and his St Clair supporters invaded England andwon the Battle of Hastings under instructions from the Black Nobility of Venice.The Coronation Crown is set with 12 jewels along with two depictions of theMaltese Cross which was one of the most prominent symbols of the Nazis. In theLeviteauthored Exodus we hear of the Breastplate of Aaron which is set with 12stones.5 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1451994] The same stones, in thesame order, appear in the British crown.6[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452087] The Archbishop placed his handsbetween the Queen’s to pay homage to the new head of his Church and he kissedher right hand. Then he said:“The Lord Almighty… establish your throne in righteousness, that it may standfor evermore, like as the sun before him, and as a faithful witness in Heaven.”7[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452203]This is almost a repeat of the words used in God’s covenant with David in theOld Testament.8 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452299] The ‘LordAlmighty’ was formerly El Shaddai or Ishkur, the son of Marduk, who is claimedto have been the son of the Anunnaki scientist, Enki, the guy who, according tothe Sumerian Texts as translated by Zecharia Sitchin, was the one who createdthe human-Anunnaki hybrids with Ninkharsag. The Windsors are of aBrotherhood-Black Nobility bloodline and the Queen was crowned in a Brotherhoodceremony inside a Brotherhood temple. This will make sense of what you are aboutto read.The Windsor bloodElizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, or Queen Elizabeth II, is, like all the royalfamilies of Europe, is the bloodline of that pivotal figure in the takeover ofBritain, William III, Prince of Orange, the man who signed into existence theBank of England. She is also blood related to earlier Black Nobility invaders ofthe British Isles, like William the Conqueror. She is an ancestor of Robert theBruce, Kenneth MacAlpin, and the Kings of Scotland, and is related to the IrishKings going back to the ancient coronation ceremonies at Tara. The Queen Mother,formerly Lady Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth) Bowes-Lyon, comes from a seriouslyBrotherhood-reptilian bloodline, a Scottish aristocratic family which connectswith the Bruces, Stuarts, MacAlpin, and down through the Kings of Ireland.Her father was Claude George Bowes-Lyon, the 14th Earl of Strathmore, and hermother was Nina Celia Cavendish-Bentinck. The wealth and power of many of theselines owes much, sometimes all, to William of Orange and those who controlledhim. It was William who made a Bentinck the first Earl of Portland inrecognition of services rendered and the second Bentinck/Duke of Portlandmarried into the Cavendish fortune to become the Cavendish-Bentinks, the line ofthe Queen Mother’s mother. This makes the Windsors blood relatives of theCavendish family, the Dukes of Devonshire of Chatsworth House. The title Earl ofStrathmore was given originally to the Queen Mother’s ancestor, Patrick Lyon, inrecognition of his support for William of Orange.9[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452393] In short, the ancestors of theWindsors were fundamental in putting the Black Nobility’s William of Orange onthe British throne after which the Bank of England and the power of the City ofLondon was firmly established. Queen Elizabeth (El-lizard-birth), through herHanoverian ancestors, and others, carries the bloodline of the Black Nobility inGermany and all these strands, be they Irish, Scottish, German, Danish, Swedish,whatever, go back via the Black Nobility Venetians through to the Phoenicians,the Egyptians, key figures like Alexander the Great, to Sumer, and thereptilians. The bloodlines are incredible and Prince Charles can trace threethousand lines of decent alone from Edward III (1312–1377),10[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452504] the monarch who formed theBrotherhood grouping the Order of the Garter. Nineteen presidents of the UnitedStates have also been related to Edward III11[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452609] and therefore the line of PrinceCharles and the Ramses-Piso-Bush tribe. Most of the others connect to thisthrough Charlemagne. The Windsors even have a blood connection to thatBrotherhood stooge, Mohammed, the official founder of Islam.12[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452794]William of Orange, William III, died in 1702. He and his wife, Mary, left noheirs and so Mary’s sister, Anne, became queen. Anne was the last of the Stuartmonarchs because although she had 17 children by her husband, George of Denmark,she survived them all. In 1714 the scene was set for the takeover of the BritishCrown by the German Black Nobility family, the Hanovers. They were closelyconnected with the House of Hesse which would become the launch pad for theHouse of Rothschild. The first Hanoverian king was George I. He couldn’t evenspeak English and refused to learn. He began life as minor German nobility, agreat grandson of the infamous James I, and ended it as King of Great Britain.This guy kept his wife, Sophia, in jail for 32 years for her alleged adulterywith the Swede, Philip von Konigsmark, who was never seen again and was rumouredto be under the floorboards of George’s Hanover Palace. George II became king in1727 and died in 1760 while sitting on the toilet suffering from acuteconstipation. Yes he died of the shits – or rather the lack of them – and therecan’t be many monarchs you can say have literally died on the throne. Hisgrandson became George III, whose reign spanned the American War of Independenceand a massive expansion of British power. George IV and William IV followedbefore we come to Queen Victoria, who reigned as Queen of Britain andQueen-Empress of the Empire from 1837 to 1901. By this time the British(reptilian) Empire controlled 40 per cent of the Earth’s land mass and more thana fifth of the population. It was the biggest empire the world had ever seen.Victoria married Prince Albert of the German Black Nobility House ofSaxe-Coburg-Gotha and had nine children who married into the other royalfamilies (family) of Europe. Victoria has an image of being very straight-laced,but like the Rothschilds, Winston Churchill, and other apparent pillars of theestablishment, she was a frequent user of cocaine and heroin.13[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1452878] Drug parties were held at theroyal summer residence at Balmoral in Scotland.14[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1453003] The first son of Victoria andAlbert became Edward VII, a Grand Master of English Freemasonry, who reigneduntil 1910. It was now, during the First World War, that the name of the royalhouse was changed from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the House of Windsor. TheGerman name, Battenberg, was also changed at the same time, 1917, to theanglicised, Mountbatten. The only reason for this sudden switch was publicrelations. The Germans and the British were slaughtering each other in thetrenches of northern France at the time. In 1936 came Edward VIII who abdicatedto marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, and he was replaced by George VI,the father of Queen Elizabeth, and husband to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the presentQueen Mother. George died in 1952 and his eldest daughter was crowned QueenElizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in 1953. By then she had married a fellowmember of the Black Nobility, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, BaronGreenwich, Earl of Merioneth, Duke of Edinburgh. He was born in Corfu, the sonof Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg, the greatgranddaughter of Queen Victoria. Philip, a Battenberg, took the anglicisedversion of Mountbatten and, after his marriage to Elizabeth, the British Royalhouse became the House of Windsor-Mountbatten. Or rather it wasSaxe-Coburg-Gotha-Battenberg. This arranged marriage was orchestrated by LordLouis ‘Dickie’ Mountbatten, Prince Philip’s uncle. Philip is extremely wellrepresented by Black Nobility (reptilian) genes, one reason why he has found itso irritating to have to walk behind his wife according to royal protocol. TheQueen is the great granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Philip is also related toVictoria through his mother. One thing to remember is that the royal ‘families’of Europe are not families at all, they are one family, offshoots of the samebloodline operating to the same Agenda. Some will do this more enthusiasticallythan others, of course, but basically that’s how it works. An example of this isthe way Prince Philip’s clan became the royal family of Greece. After BritishIntelligence had organised a coup against the ‘Greek’ King, Otto I (a German!),and removed him from the Greek throne in 1862, they selected Prince William, thenephew of the Danish king, to become King of Greece. I know all this soundsludicrous, but to the Black Nobility this is like a multinational companyfilling its executive vacancies. Prince William of the Danes became King GeorgeI of Greece. (No, you didn’t misread that.) William, sorry George, er, er, yesGeorge, married a granddaughter of the Russian Tsar Nicholas I and Prince Philipis related to seven Tsars. He has massive bloodline connections into Germany andalso Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and to most of the royal lines of Europe. One ofhis ancestors is Christian, Count of Oldenberg, who died in 1167, and, as Imentioned earlier, one of the two people who founded the European dynasties ofthe Black Nobility. Philip was in line for the Greek throne when, while he wasstill a child, another coup removed the Greek monarchy and the family headed forFrance where he began his education at a private school in Paris. In the years1931 and 1932 Philip’s four older sisters married into the German-Austrianaristocracy. Margarita married a grandson of Queen Victoria, the Czech-Austrianprince, Gottfried von Hohenlohe-Langenburg; Cecilia married a great grandson ofQueen Victoria, Georg Donatus, Grand Duke of Hess-by-Rhine; Sophie’s partner wasPrince Christoph of Hesse; and Theodora married Berthold, the Margrave of Baden.Berthold’s father was Max von Baden, the German Chancellor during World War I.Max von Baden founded a school near Lake Constantine in Germany via his personalsecretary, Kurt Hahn, who was trained at Oxford, the Brotherhood’s premiertraining ground for new recruits. Hahn was head of the intelligence desk at theBerlin Foreign Ministry during the war and was Max von Baden’s advisor at theRothschild-controlled Versailles Peace Conference. It was to their fascistschool in Schloss Salem that Prince Philip was sent to be ‘educated’. At thetime it was under the control of the Nazi Party and Hitler Youth Movement, withNazi ‘race science’ on the curriculum. It had quite an impact on Philip as weshall see. Kurt Hahn had left before Philip arrived, but he was not finishedwith the ‘education’ business. Hahn, a fascist to his core, went to Scotland andstarted the Gordonstoun Academy, the school where Prince Charles was sent to beindoctrinated. Hahn the fascist also became an advisor to the British ForeignOffice. After four years at Hahn’s German Nazi school, Philip was sent toGordonstoun on November 16th 1937 as the approach to the Second World Wargathered pace.15 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1453087] The Britishpublic school system, and its equivalent in the United States and elsewhere, isa vital part of the Brotherhood network. It is the recruiting and trainingground designed to turn out either psychopaths or mentally and emotionallybroken people who have learned to do exactly as they are told. You have only gotto talk with some of those who have experienced it to know what a mind controloperation it is. There are support groups to counsel people who have beenmentally and emotionally scarred for life by what happened to them. It islegalised child abuse. In Britain, the children of the aristocracy and wealthyfamilies (and others who know no better) are taken from home at the age of sixand dumped at their first boarding or ‘prep’ school. ‘Prep’ means preparation tobe indoctrinated. Already they are feeling unloved and frightened as theirparents drive away, leaving them in a strange place among strange people. Irepeat these kids are just six. Can you imagine the effect of that on a littlechild? From the formal, loveless life of prep school they go on to a publicschool. Eton and Harrow are the most famous and Prince William, the heir to thethrone behind his father, Prince Charles, was sent to Eton. At these prep andpublic schools, the children either conform to the rules, regulations andthought control or they incur the wrath of the black gowns, the men in black.The ‘fagging’ system in which younger boys become slaves to the older ones hasencouraged the desire to dominate and control others and introduced youngstersto the ‘joys’ of inflicting pain and torture on others. A friend of mine who wasdetermined not to be broken by the endless beatings he received from bothteachers and older boys, was forced to lie in ice-cold baths in an attempt tobreak his spirit. It is from these schools, and the Oxford and CambridgeUniversities, that the often deeply imbalanced people emerge who enter thepositions of financial, political, military and royal power. The psychopathsamong them give the orders and those of broken spirit do as they are toldwithout question, just as they have been trained to do. The lack of femalecompany encourages homosexual activity and many of these people find it verydifficult to relate to women. I’m not condemning homosexuality, by the way,everyone to their own as long as they don’t force it on anyone else. I’m justexplaining what happens, that’s all. There are some strange goings on at suchschools which are designed to affect the minds of the children involved. Sexualabuse is definitely part of that. Tony Blair, the Brotherhood chosen one whobecame British Prime Minister on May 1st 1997, attended the public school calledFettes College in Edinburgh, Scotland, where one of his close friends was theschool chaplain, the Very Reverend Ronald Selby Wright, a senior figure in theChurch of Scotland. Selby Wright was later revealed to be a persistentpaedophile abusing boys at Fettes and elsewhere.16[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454028] Blair, who is close to theWindsors, went on to Oxford University and became a barrister at the ancientInns of Court at Temple Bar in London. The public school system is horrific andschools such as Gordonstoun and Schloss Salem, which Philip attended, are at theextreme end even of that.Prince Philip’s family were supporters of the Nazi Party and by 1935 PrinceChristoph, the husband of his sister Sophie, was a colonel in the SS onHimmler’s personal staff and head of the Forschungsamt, an Elite intelligenceoperation controlled by Hermann Goering. The Forschungsamt gathered intelligenceon Jews and others the Nazis wished to destroy, worked with the Gestapo, andalso spied on members of the Nazi Party itself. It was they who carried out thefamous Night of the Long Knives when Hitler removed his key opponents. Christophand Sophie named their eldest child, Karl Adolf, after Adolf Hitler and PrincePhilip would be involved in his education. Christoph’s brother, Philip of Hesse,was related to the King of Italy and he was the official liaison between thefascists of Italy and Germany. At the same time, the British King, Edward VIII,was also a Nazi supporter and Philip maintained communications with him afterhis forced abdication in 1936. The official reason for this was Edward’srelationship with the American divorcee, Wallis Simpson. After just 325 daysEdward went into exile to the Rothschild mansion in Austria and later settled inParis. Edward’s Paris home was bought by Mohamed Al Fayed in the 1990s and Dianaand Dodi Fayed visited the house on the day they died. One of Edward’s biggestsupporters was the fascist paedophile and Satanist Lord Louis Mountbatten, uncleof Prince Philip and Philip’s route into the British Royal Family. Mountbattenwas a great grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was born at WindsorCastle in 1900. While Mountbatten (Battenberg) was apparently fighting on theBritish side during the war, he was maintaining communications with his, and theWindsors’, German clan via his sister Louise, the Crown Princess of Sweden andwife of King Gustav. Louise was Prince Philip’s aunt. At the end of the war, inJune 1945, the British king, George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth andhusband of the Queen Mother, sent the former MI5 officer, Anthony Blunt, to theKronberg Castle of Philip’s sister Sophie, and her Nazi husband Prince Christophof Hesse, to recover correspondence between the British Royal family and theirNazi relatives.17 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454188] Blunt was the‘Surveyor of the Queen’s Pictures’ and a world expert in the paintings ofPoussin, the initiate who painted pictures called The Shepherds Of Arcadia whichvery much related to the mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau. Blunt was exposed as amember of a ‘KGB’ unit inside British Intelligence along with Burgess, Macleanand Philby. The fifth man, who was never named, was Lord Victor Rothschild (see…And The Truth Shall Set You Free). In fact it was a Brotherhood unit and not,ultimately, answerable to the KGB. When Blunt was finally collared in the 1980s,Queen Elizabeth apparently demanded that he was not questioned on hisclandestine mission to Kronberg Castle.18[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454338] Lord Mountbatten, this archmanipulator for the Black Nobility, held key positions at vital moments inhistory. He was Supreme Commander in south east Asia during the Second World War(where Prince Philip also served); he was the last Viceroy of India and theGovernor-general during the British withdrawal; and he was First Sea Lord, thepinnacle of the British Navy, at the time of the British invasion of Suez in1958. Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb in Ireland in 1979, but as theseterrorist groups subcontract ‘hits’ between each other the true origin of theassassination cannot be stated with certainty.The Windsor wealthThe Windsors are wealthy beyond description. The Queen’s title of the ‘richestwoman in the world’ hardly tells the story and no wonder Prince Philip calls theWindsors ‘the family firm’. They have inherited the accumulated wealth of theQueen’s Black Nobility ancestors in land, homes, art treasures and jewels. Someof them the Queen owns and others are officially owned by the ‘state’, which, asa result, she can pass on untaxed to each generation of her family. Ownership bythe state means ownership by the Black Nobility which controls the state. Thisis just some of the Windsor booty:The Queen has more than 300 residences, including castles or palaces likeBuckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace (where Diana lived), StJames Palace, (the London base of Prince Charles), Holyrood House in Edinburgh,Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk where Diana first metPrince Charles. She owns the Duchy of Lancaster with around 40,000 acres ofland, mostly agricultural, but including prime development sites of enormousvalue. Parliament passed a bill in 1988 to allow her to develop and sell some ofthis land around the Strand in London. Like much of her wealth, the contents ofthe Duchy of Lancaster was stolen, in this case from Simon de Montfort junior bythe son of Henry III after de Montfort’s efforts to establish a strongparliament were defeated in 1265. If you look at the records you will probablyfind that the de Montforts stole it from someone else. The Windsors own anotherDuchy, that of Cornwall, administered by Prince Charles. This is another 44,000acres which also includes plots in the most expensive parts of London. The Queenhas inherited or purchased the world’s biggest private collection of jewels. TheKoh-i-noor Diamond, then the world’s largest, was presented to Queen Victoriaafter the East India Company had defeated the Maharajah of the Punjab in 1851.The Cullinen Diamond was a peace offering to British royalty after the Boer Warin South Africa which was engineered by Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Milner, theRothschilds and the Round Table. Other gifts have come from Arab oil sheikhs andvarious heads of state. More than 7,000 paintings and 20,000 drawings by oldmasters are owned by the Royal Collection Trust which the Queen controls. Sheprivately owns a vast collection of other works and all this will be passed downthe Windsor line when she dies, unless the nation wakes up and brings an end tothe monarchy.No-one knows what the Windsors really own because it is forbidden for Parliamenteven to discuss the fact that the Queen keeps her private wealth a secret.19[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454426] Such secrecy is vital to preventoutrage by her ‘subjects’ and to allow her to use her privilege for insidertrading, a practice which is illegal. Insider trading is to be in a position tohear privileged information which could be used to make a financial killing andthen to use that knowledge to do just that. The Queen, with her colossalportfolio of global investments, is in the perfect position to make unlimitedprofits. She is constantly kept informed, via meetings with prime ministers,ministers, officials, British Intelligence and other sources, of the secrethappenings in the world. She knows through these channels and others, where thebest and worst investments are going to be and through her secret network shecan ensure that the most effective financial use is made of that information. Itwas exposed in 1977 that the Bank of England, the creation of the BlackNobility, had established a company called the Bank of England Nominees Ltd(BOEN), to hide the Queen’s investments.20[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454577] The Windsor line has had aparticularly profitable relationship with the City of London since the reign ofEdward VII, the son of Queen Victoria. Edward’s leading financial advisor wasErnest Cassel, the Black Nobility banker. Cassel’s daughter and heiress, Edwina,would marry Lord Louis Mountbatten, the foremost influence on both Prince Philipand Prince Charles. Edward VII, a leading Freemason, was also close to theRothschilds, the Sassoons (an offshoot of the Rothschild bloodline), and theAmerican Payseur-Rothschild clones, Morgan and Harriman. Other financial nameswith long royal associations are Barings and Morgan Grenfell. The privatefinancial advisor to George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth, was Sir EdwardPeacock of Barings Bank and the Bank of England. The King awarded Peacock aGrand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, so the advice was obviously veryprofitable. George VI also made Lord Cromer his Lord Chamberlain, the highestrank in the Royal Household. Cromer was at one time managing director ofBarings.Researchers like Philip Beresford, the author of The Book Of The British Rich,say that Queen Elizabeth invests in the major corporations like Rio Tinto(formerly Rio Tinto Zinc or RTZ), Royal Dutch Shell, ICI and General Electric.This makes sense because these are all pillars of the Black Nobility. The Queenappears to have substantial investments in Rio Tinto, the biggest mining companyin the world. It was established in 1873 by Hugh Matheson of the global drugrunning operation called Jardine Matheson. Rio Tinto was in at the start ofNorth Sea oil and, along with Texaco, was using the refineries of BP in whichthe Queen is also believed to have major investments. The Queen would have madeenormous profits at each point in the operation and she would have had insiderknowledge of the North Sea potential. Perhaps the most blatant conflict ofinterest to be identified was Rio Tinto’s involvement in a cartel formed in 1971to fix the price of uranium. A federal grand jury and the 1976 US Senate ForeignRelations Committee, chaired by Frank Church, exposed the sting. It alsoincluded a company called Mary Kathleen Uranium of Australia. This company hadbeen secretly encouraging the Aborigines to occupy uranium lands in Australia totake them out of production and so raise the price on the world market.21[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454661] The manufactured shortage ofuranium had a serious effect on the American Westinghouse company who sought totake legal action against Rio Tinto for price rigging. An American court orderedthat Rio Tinto officials answer questions, but this was quashed by the BritishLaw Lords (Black Nobility and their clones). The Australian government passedlegislation to the same effect. This was after the Australian Prime Minister,Gough Whitlam, had been dismissed from office by the Queen’s Governor General ofAustralia, Sir John Kerr. Whitlam was pursuing a policy of buying out the miningand raw material cartels, like Rio Tinto and Anglo-American, to stop them rapingAustralia’s resource base, while giving nothing in return. The Queen, withenormous investments in both companies, removed Whitlam by using some of herwide range of ‘Prerogative Powers’ which she can instigate when necessary. TheQueen has no power these days? Sure. Part of the scam is to encourage people tobelieve that she has no power while giving her amazing powers should the needarise for emergency action by the Brotherhood. Sir John Kerr, a former highlevel operative for British Intelligence, an arm of the Black Nobility, was madea member of the Privy Council and the Royal Victorian Order for his loyal andmost profitable service to the Queen’s portfolio. He was later murdered,however, when there was a danger of the truth coming out about the removal ofGough Whitlam.22 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454751]The Queen has massive investments in America and many of these relate to thefounding of the Virginia Company under James I and Sir Francis Bacon whichcarved up those lands from the very start. The British Crown still owns America(possibly on behalf of the Vatican) and, with the London-based Brotherhood, theQueen enjoys an amazing income from the raw materials and other profitsgenerated by the United States (the Virginia Company). In 1966 two UScongressmen described in the congressional record how the Queen owned one of theworld’s largest plantations in Scott, Mississippi, close to the Arkansas border,called the Delta and Pine Land Company. It was worth even at that time some$44.5 million and yet it paid its hundreds of black labourers a pittance. Notethe name, too. Delta (the triangle or pyramid) is a major symbol which is whythe Elite US Military unit is called Delta Force. The pornography collection inthe Library of Congress is known as the Delta Collection and the Delta, orTriad, is featured in the logos of hundreds of American businesses, includingDelta Airlines. Not by coincidence Delta is also the symbol of Royal ArchFreemasonry. This is where the name of the Chinese organised crime operation,the Triads (triangle), comes from and the Elite grouping called the TrilateralCommission. When Adnan Khashoggi, the notorious global arms dealer, opened anAmerican branch of his operation he called it Triad America. Khashoggi, arelative of the Fayeds, is an associate of George Bush, who is a close friendand blood relative of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. From 1968 the Queen’sDelta and Pine company attracted US government subsidies of $1.5 million.Senator McIntyre said in Congress on April 16th 1970 that the government had“Paid the Queen $120,000 for not planting cotton on farmland she owns inMississippi”.23 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1454981] The New YorkerMagazine also reported that the Queen is the biggest owner of slum property inNew York City and her holdings include the theatre district, 42nd Street.24[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455111] It is reckoned that between 3,000and 5,000 families own and control the world economy, but the number of peopleat the core of that control is far, far fewer: a relative handful. The Windsorsare definitely among or very close to that inner circle Elite. This Brotherhoodcartel controls every aspect of the global economic network, the banks,insurance companies, raw materials, transportation, factories, finishedproducts, major retail groups (and by market rigging all the rest), the stockand material markets, governments, media, intelligence agencies and so on. Thisis coordinated through the secret societies and one of their most importantvehicles is the City of London-House of Windsor operation called the Club of theIsles. It was named after King Edward VII, Queen Victoria’s son, who was thefirst to carry the title Prince of the Isles. The title is held today by PrinceCharles. Edward was heavily involved with Black Nobility barons of the SquareMile London financial district and helped them to engineer the Crimean War, theRussia-Japan War, the preparations for the First World War and the Opium Warswith China. Through the central organisation of the Club of the Isles comes thefantastic web of interlocking directorships which hold apparently ‘independent’companies in a network of common control and common agenda. Some of this webinclude:The Bank of England; Anglo-American Corp of South Africa; Rio Tinto; MinorcoMinerals and Resources Corp; De Beers Consolidated Mines and De Beers CentenaryAG; N. M. Rothchild Bank; Barclays Bank; Lloyds Bank; Lloyds Insurance Market;Midland Bank (now HSBC); National Westminster Bank; Barings Bank; SchrodersBank; Standard Chartered Bank; Hambros Bank; S. G. Warburg; Toronto DominionBank; Johnson Matthey; Klienwort Benson Group; Lazard Brothers; Lonrho; J. P.Morgan and Co; Morgan Grenfell Group; British Petroleum; Shell and Royal DutchPetroleum; Cadbury-Schweppes; BAT Industries; Assicurazioni Generali SpA,(Venice) Italy; Courtaulds; General Electric; Cazeenove and Co; GrandMetropolitan; Hanson plc; HSBS Holdings (Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank); ImperialChemical Industries; Inchscape plc; Inco Ltd; ING Group; Jardine Matheson;Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co (P & O); Pilkington Glass; ReutersHoldings; Glaxo Wellcome; SmithKline Beecham; Unilever and Unilever NV; Vickersplc;And that is just a few of them! Each of these corporations have staggering listsof subsidiaries going on for page after page. Lonrho alone at the time ofwriting has 640 subsidiares.These London-based operations connect with those inother developed and developing countries giving the Black Nobility-Windsorcartels control over world banking and mineral, energy and food production. Oneof the Black Nobility companies in the United States is Archer Daniels Midland,headed by the Bilderberger, Dwayne Andreas, one of the main financial backers ofthe deeply corrupt US politician, Bob Dole, who so meekly ‘opposed’ theBrotherhood choice, Bill Clinton, in the 1996 presidential election. The BlackNobility has made the City of London the world financial centre since itsarrival en masse with William of Orange. Today this centre is home to over aquarter of the world’s foreign exchange turnover and the London Stock Exchangelists more foreign companies than any other. Ninety per cent of cross-exchangetrading in Europe is handled by the City and it is the world’s biggest issuer ofEurobonds. The leading commodity futures markets in Europe are based here, asare the London Metal Exchange, the International Financial Petroleum Exchangeand the London Commodity Exchange. I understand from contacts in America that itis through organisations like the London Metal Exchange that profits from theVirginia Company (United States of America) are channelled back to London. TheCity is the centre for international marine, aviation, and commercial insuranceand reinsurance. The City dominates world fund management for foreigninstitutions and governments and all these City operations have Freemasons inprominent positions.25 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455195] More than500 foreign banks have offices in the City and in 1993 UK-based banks accountedfor 16% of lending worldwide, an astonishing figure for these small islands. Theinterlocking directorships between these banks and businesses are simplybreathtaking.

Add tothat the control of the media via organisations like the BBC, the Reuters newsagency, Hollinger Inc.,Thomson, News Corporation, Pearson, Reed Elsevier, TheWashington Post, New York Times, NBC, CBS, ABC, etc, etc… and you control theworld. More than that, the people don’t know this is happening and therefore youcan continue indefinitely without challenge or exposure.One of the banks close to the Queen is Hambros plc, a Black Nobility strongholdbased in Tower Hill, London. Joseph Hambro was a banker to the kings of Denmark,Norway, and Sweden, and did much business with the Rothschilds. His son, CarlJoachim Hambro, moved from Copenhagen to London in 1839 and four years laterParliament passed legislation to make Hambros a ‘British’ bank. Like theRothschilds, the Hambros family made much of their fortune funding wars and,again like the Rothschilds, they became heavily involved in BritishIntelligence. J. H. ‘Jack’ Hambro, the head of the firm from 1933, ran theUnited Kingdom Corp, the economic warfare operation of British Intelligenceduring the First World War. His son, Sir Charles Hambro, was director of theélite Special Operations Executive during the Second World War while VictorRothschild was also manipulating events within the British Intelligence network.It was the Special Operations Executive (SOE) which formed the company now knownas Hollinger Inc., the media giant headed by Conrad Black, the son of the SOEagent who helped to set it up. Sir Charles Hambro’s son, Lord Hambro, now headsthe firm. His CV includes Guardian Royal Exchange Insurance (chairman); thePeninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the drug running operationduring the Opium wars, now known as P & O (director); San Paolo Bank Holdings(director); and the Conservative Party (senior treasurer). Also on the HambrosBoard are Sir Chippendale Keswick of the infamous drug running family who isalso connected with De Beers, Anglo-American and the Bank of England among manyothers; Hambros director, Lord Kingsdowne, has a CV including Glaxo Wellcome,the Bank of England, National Westminster Bank, Redland plc, Foreign andColonial Investment Trust, National Economic Investment Council, and theDitchley Foundation, a Brotherhood circle which interlocks with others like theBilderberg Group. Also among the Hambro directors are Lord Halifax and JohnClay, a director of the Guardian Media Group which claims to be‘anti-establishment’ while being part of the web. In the 1970s, a Hambrosdirector was Lord Carrington, close associate of Henry Kissinger and chairman ofthe Bilderberg Group from 1991. It was during the 1970s that Hambros had asignificant stake in a bank called the Banco Privata which was involved in theP2 Freemasonry scandal and was connected to the bank at the centre of thescandal, Ambrosiano Bank. The coordinator of this fraud was Michael Sindona, themain shareholder in Banco Privata and another of his holding companies, LaCentrale Finanzaria, had Jocelyn Hambro and Evelyn de Rothschild on the board.The Sindona financial network was funding P2 and bleeding the Vatican Bank ofenormous sums. In turn, P2 was funding and organising terrorism in Italyincluding the bomb which killed 85 people at Bologna railway station. Exposureof P2 was followed by the murder, in accordance with Freemasonic ritual, of thehead of the Ambrosiano Bank, Roberto Calvi under Blackfriars Bridge in Londonalongside the financial district. I bet the Hambro clan were so relieved that hewasn’t able to talk. Sindona later said that Freemasons from South America hadcarried out the killing. Each part of the network sub-contracts itsassassinations to another branch to make the truth harder to establish. TheHambros operation, like all the others, stinks so high it would take the world’ssupply of deodorant to suppress the stench. But save your most powerful airfreshener for the Queen and the House of Windsor. They are connected with allthe titled criminals who are ripping off the planet and causing death,destruction and misery all over the world. And get this: if you are British youare paying them to do it! The Windsors are knowingly part of this web and theirpublic face is a mere façade to hide the cesspit from which they operate behindthe scenes. This control cascades out of London to the rest of the world wherethe Elite bloodlines rule on behalf of the reptilian Agenda.The Windsor powerThe British Royal family have always been close to Freemasonry and their ownorders like the Knights of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the RoyalVictorian Order interlock with the Freemasonic networks. So, of course, does theOrder of St John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta). The expansion of Freemasonryin England in the 18th century coincided with the arrival of the GermanHanoverian dynasty. The current Grand Master of the English Grand Lodge in GreatQueen (Semiramis/Isis) Street in London is the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Kent.Prince Philip was initiated into the Navy Lodge number 2612 on December 5th1952.27 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455504] His father in law, GeorgeVI, the Queen’s father and husband of the Queen Mother, was an ardent Mason,28[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455613] as was Edward VII and most othermonarchs since the emergence of Freemasonry. The Queen is ‘Grand Patroness’ ofFreemasonry. She is served by the 390 members of the so-called Privy Councilwhich connects with its equivalent in other Commonwealth countries. It islegally above Parliament because of its prerogative powers. Its members, who areappointed for life, include Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the Archbishop ofCanterbury, and the Prime Minister. Nine official meetings are held each yearand the government ministers stand to attention while the Queen is told of thegovernment measures they are asking the Queen to approve. This Privy Council ofinner-circle politicians, courtiers and public servants have to bow to the Queenand shake her hand before standing in line and they are sworn to conduct theirbusiness in the utmost secrecy.29 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455697]Another of the Windsor-Black Nobility vehicles for global manipulation is theCrown Agents. This organisation was formed in 1833 as ‘Crown Agents for theColonies’ to run the day-to-day administration in the Empire and serve asprivate bankers to government officials, colonial authorities and heads ofstate. It also supplied a vast range of goods, including arms. Given the methodsand background of the British Empire, it would certainly have been involved inthe drugs market. The Crown Agents has a long history of involvement withorganised crime and operates covert arms shipments into Africa which are used tocause the genocidal wars.30 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455825] Thiswas, and is, a Crown Agency working for the monarch and yet had its entire debtguaranteed by the British government. In the 1970s it was bailed out by a Bankof England rescue costing hundreds of millions of pounds. For many years itmanaged the personal wealth of the Sultan of Brunei, the friend of the Queen anda funder of many private projects for Prince Philip, Prince Charles and GeorgeBush. The Sultan is also a financial backer of unofficial British and AmericanIntelligence operations31 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1455978] and aman who has funded the operation of Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi. The CrownAgents were ‘privatised’ in 1996 with the name Crown Agents for OverseasGovernment and Administrations Ltd. ‘Privatisation’ is Brotherhood-speak for thetransfer of power from Black Nobility via government agency to Black Nobilityvia direct ownership. The new Crown Agents acts as a holding company for a longlist of companies and ventures and it continues as before as a vital cog in thenetwork throughout the world. It’s chairman, David H. Probert, is the formerdirector of the British weapons manufacturer, Birmingham Small Arms Ltd, and adirector is F. Cassell (that name again), a Companion of the Bath (aQueen-awarded title), and former executive director of the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank for Great Britain. The Crown Agents Foundation,which holds the share capital in trust, is headed by Sir David Rowe-Ham, KnightGrand Cross of the British Empire. This trust includes Barclays Bank, Standardand Chartered Bank, Unilever, Tate and Lyle, Securicor (a global operator of‘security services’), British Telecom, the Prince of Wales Business LeadersForum (headed by Prince Charles), and the Aga Khan Foundation. The same oldcrowd. The Crown Agents manages the customs services for Mozambique and, througha company called Europe SA, is in charge of all economic constructionprocurement for Bosnia… yes, Bosnia. It is also involved in a joint venture witha Monaco-based company, ES-KO, to provide all the food for United Nationspeacekeeping forces in Angola and Bosnia.32[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456073] So the more wars and conflict, themore money the Crown Agents has the potential to make.An important part of the Windsor-Black Nobility-City of London web are theso-called ‘City Livery Companies’. These allege to represent the various groupsof merchants like the gun makers, stationers and newspaper makers, thegoldsmiths, and such like. In fact they are secret societies fundamental to thecontrol of the City institutions and much further afield. In the 1350s, in thewake of the plague known as the Black Death, government of the City was passedfrom the ward councils to the City Livery Companies. The Templars were stillvery active behind the scenes and the power appeared to be concentrated in theMasons Guild. This network interlocks with its offshoots around the world. In1979, the year that Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister, theHonourable Company of Freemen of the City of London of North America began tohold meetings in New York and Toronto, and on October 21st 1991 the Associationof Liverymen of the City of London in Hong Kong was founded and all theirmembers appeared to be architects (Freemasons).33[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456164] The late author, Peter Jones,researched some of the Livery Companies in the 1990s for his book, The ObedienceOf Australia, which exposed the manipulation which led to the removal by theQueen of Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. These are some of the nameshe found within these ‘Companies’: * Engineers: Duke of Edinburgh. * * Airline Pilots and Navigators: Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew. * Butchers: Queen Mother, Lord Vestey (of the meat family and the Lord Prior of the Order of St John of Jerusalem). * Merchant Taylors: Queen Mother, Lord Whitelaw (alleged Satanist and former deputy prime minister to Margaret Thatcher), Lord Hailsham. * Glovers: Margaret Thatcher, Sir John Fieldhouse (the Admiral of the Fleet), both at the forefront of the 1982 Falklands War. * Poulterers: Margaret Thatcher, Duchess of Devonshire (Chatsworth House). * Fishmongers: Duke of Devonshire, Duchess of Devonshire, C. E. A. Hambro (Hambros Bank, Taylor Woodrow, P & O), Lord Inchcape (Inchcape plc, P & O, Her Majesty’s Lieutenant of London). * Goldsmiths: J. H. Hambro. * Grocers: Edward Heath (Satanist and former British Prime Minister, Bilderberg Group and architect of Britain’s entry into the European Community). * Salters: Duke of Kent (Grand Master of English Freemasonry), Lord Armstrong (the man with the long list of government and business appointments I mentioned earlier). * Clothworkers: Sir Peter Gadsden (a Grand Master at the United Grand Lodge), Lord Carrington (Bilderberg Group chairman, President of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and major Brotherhood operative).Another name that appears in many of these Livery Companies is McAlpine, theconstruction family, with the Satanist tendencies. These groups link into theFreemason networks. There are more Freemasons per square foot in the Square Mileof the City of London financial centre than anywhere else on Planet Earth. TheBank of England has its own Freemasonry Lodge (Lodge No 263), so do other bankslike Lloyds (Black Horse of Lombard Street Lodge, No 4155), and there is theélite Guildhall Lodge, based at the Mansion House since 1905. The Mansion Houseis the official residence of the Lord (Freemason) Mayor of London and more than60 Mayors have been Masters of the Lodge.34[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456283] Look at that Lloyd’s symbol, theBlack Horse (Black Sun) of Lombard Street Lodge. Lombardy was a financialfiefdom of the Black Nobility Venetian/Phoenicians.The Windors are part of this reptilian network of financial and politicalmanipulators, Satanists and ritual child killers. Knowingly so. The network hasamong its number, via its countless secret societies, the leading judges,policemen, politicians, business people, top civil servants, media owners andeditors. Under these kings and generals of the network come the corporals andthe foot soldiers who have no idea of the scale of the Agenda they are involvedin. If the Brotherhood want someone framed, prosecuted, or murdered, it happens.If they want one of their people protected from prosecution, it happens. If theywant a controversial proposal like a new road, a building or law change to beapproved, they make sure one of their guys is appointed to head the official‘inquiry’ to make the decision they want. This network selects the primeministers through their manipulation of all political parties and appoints theleading government officials. The Black Nobility networks do the same in othercountries, including, no, especially, in the United States. See …And the TruthShall Set You Free for details of this.The Windsor friendsYou can tell a lot about the attitudes and motivations of people by the companythey choose to keep and those they choose to ‘honour’. It is rare for the Queento give knighthoods to people outside the Commonwealth and those she has chosenfor such ‘Honorary Knighthoods’ read like a business meeting of Brotherhoodoperatives. The titles are dubbed ‘honorary’ because the American Constitutionforbids the acceptance of titles from the monarch of a foreign state without thepermission of Congress. So few of these honours are given because, as a Britishgovernment official put it: “One must not debase the currency”.35[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456399] I wonder if you think thefollowing names debase the currency: Henry Kissinger, the Satanist, ritual childkiller and mass murderer, was made Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michaeland St George at a ceremony at Windsor Castle. This is normally awarded to topBritish diplomats and that is very appropriate because Kissinger has alwaysserved the Black Nobility of London. This included the time when, as USSecretary of State and National Security Advisor, he manipulated the Watergateaffair to remove Richard Nixon and replace him with the rapist and child abuser,Gerald Ford, and his vice-president, Nelson Rockefeller (See …And The TruthShall Set You Free). Kissinger ‘gofer’ Brent Scowcroft, an executive ofKissinger Associates and top advisor to George Bush, was made an Honorary Knightof the British Empire by the Queen. So was Casper Weinberger, another Bushclone, who was involved in the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal. George Bushhimself, the paedophile, ritual child killer, mass murderer and Satanist, is avery close friend and blood relative of the Windsors. The Queen made him anHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, as she did with thatBrotherhood script-reader and rapist of mind controlled slaves, Ronald Reagan,himself a product of mind control. This is the highest award it is possible forher to give to someone outside the Commonwealth. The Order of the Bath sounds asilly title unless you understand the symbolism. The resurrection bath ofalchemy symbolises rebirth and purification or absolution. Baths are given toMasonic ‘Knights of the Bath’ before they perform horrendous deeds, hence ‘bloodbaths’.36 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456552] George Bush and theQueen get on so well because they are both of European ‘royal’ andaristocratic-reptilian blood. They are both shapeshifters. George and his wife,Barbara Pierce Bush (of Merrill, Lynch, Fenner, and Smith), are descended fromthe same Pierce family of England as the American President, Franklin Pierce.The Pierce family is, in fact, the powerful Percy aristocratic family of Englandwhich changed its name to Pierce and some of them emigrated to America whentheir involvement became known in the failed gunpowder plot which attempted toblow up Parliament. One of the Percy homes where the plan was hatched was calledSyon House.37 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1456852] Other Bush relativesinclude the Grosvenor families of England and America and the Taft family ofOhio. The English Grosvenors are the Dukes of Westminster who own the primeproperties in the City of London, the financial headquarters of the BlackNobility. The Grosvenors of America founded the National Geographic which isnotorious for removing the archaeological treasures of the world, especiallythose with religious significance, and relocating them at the SmithsonianInstitute in Washington DC. The Institute is controlled by the Grosvenor’scousins, the Smithsons, who are also descended from the Percys.38[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457032] The ancestry of George Bush canalso be traced to England’s King Alfred the Great and to Charlemagne, thecelebrated monarch who served the Brotherhood Agenda in France in the eighth andninth centuries. The same genealogical line can be traced to 32 other Presidentsof the United States, who are therefore all related to Bush.39[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457116] The Queen was most grateful toBush and her other friends who manipulated and ‘won’ the Gulf War. The militarycommander, Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf, who has lied through his teeth about thecause of Gulf War Syndrome, and Colin (Colon) Powell, the Brotherhood’s chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were both awarded by her most gracious majesty,fawn, fawn, the title of Honorary Knight of the British Empire. (Powell isrelated to King George II, the same as George Bush and Dan Quayle, President andVice-president during the Gulf War in which Powell headed the US forces.)Douglas Fairbanks, the actor and tool of the British and US military, wasaide-de-camp to the Satanist and fascist, Lord Mountbatten, and was rewardedwith a stream of chivalric honours, including Knight of the British Empire.Another name that stands out is Paul Mellon, a very close friend of the Queenand related to Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Queen made him an Honorary Knight ofthe British Empire. The Dutch wing of the Black Nobility, through PrincePhilip’s buddy, the SS officer, Prince Bernhard, made Mellon a Knight of theOrder of Orange Nassau. The title is in honour of William of Orange and thesecret society, the Orange Order. Paul Mellon is a central figure in theLondon-based control of the United States by another incredible network offamilies, including the Rockefellers, Harrimans, Bushes, Kennedys and Morgans,which is based in New York, Virginia (Washington) and Boston. Thus it is knownas the Eastern Establishment. The Mellon family association with the Windsorsgoes back a long time. Paul’s mother was an heiress to the Guiness fortune andhis father, Andrew Mellon, became a confidant of the Windsors when he was USAmbassador to London (the ‘Court of St James’s’) in 1932 and 33. He was followedby another Brotherhood crook, Joseph Kennedy, the father of JFK. Mellon wasthree times US Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Harding, Coolidge, andHoover, representing Black Nobility interests. It was he who financed thecreation of the aluminium cartel known as ALCOA to control the price and supplyof aluminium, in the same way the Brotherhood have done with oil, gold,diamonds, drugs, ad infinitum. It was Mellon and ALCOA which introduced thepolicy of putting fluoride into drinking water to make money from a by-productof the aluminium industry which at the time they were struggling to dispose of.It has nothing to do with saving teeth. Fluoride was actually used as a ratpoison for 40 years and it is an intellect suppressant. See The Robots’Rebellion for that story. Andrew Mellon financed the creation of Gulf Oil whichworked closely with British Petroleum (formerly Anglo-Persian). One of theiroperations was the coup against the Iranian Prime Minister, Dr MohammedMossadegh, in 1953. Mossedagh wanted to stop the exploitation of his country,but the Anglo-American Elite conspired against him and imposed on the Iranianpeople the vicious, murderous regime of the Shah of Iran. One of the peopleinvolved in the coup was Norman Schwarzkopf senior, the father of the Gulf Warcommander so honoured by the Queen. This story is told at length in …And TheTruth Shall Set You Free. Andrew Mellon was also behind the Dawes and YoungPlans which financed the Nazi war machine and caused the economic collapse inGermany that brought Adolf Hitler to power. His son, Paul Mellon, was brought upin England, but returned to the United States to attend Yale University, home ofthe Skull and Bones Society. He turned down membership of that, but insteadjoined the Scroll and Key, another Brotherhood operation. After Yale, it wasback to England to study at Cambridge University where so many BritishIntelligence operatives are spotted and recruited. His father and motherdivorced and he settled with her in Virginia, some 40 miles from Washington DC,where you find names for counties like Loudoun and Orange. This area had longbeen occupied by the US representatives of the Black Nobility like theHarrimans. The Queen and Prince Philip have often visited Paul Mellon at hisRokeby Estate in Virginia and both Prince Charles and Princess Anne have beenthere.40 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457356] Prince Philip went toMellon to fund the World Wildlife Fund. Buckingham Palace told ExecutiveIntelligence Review investigator, Scott Thompson:“I am commanded by The Queen to thank you for your letter… concerning Mr. PaulMellon. The Queen has known Mr. Mellon for many years and visited his estate atUpperville, Virginia, probably for the first time in the 1950s.”41[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457501]The Queen was following in the footsteps of her uncle, the ill-fated Nazisupporter Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated in 1936 to marryWallis Simpson. Paul Mellon’s sister, Ailsa, was part of the Duke’s intimatecircle of friends in Virginia. Wallis Simpson, formerly Wallis Warfield,attended the exclusive Foxcroft School in this area. Another of the Queen’sclose friends, and the Mellons’, is William Farish III. The Queen keeps some ofher breeding mares at his Lane’s End Farm, near Versailles, Kentucky, and shehas been a regular visitor. Paul Mellon often flies in by private jet to jointhem. William Farish III is a close associate of the Queen’s close friend,George Bush. Farish came to prominence when he was the keeper of Bush’s ‘blindtrust’, the system in which presidents are not supposed to know where theirmoney is invested while in office. Unlike the Queen! But, of course, it’s all asham and Bush made a fortune for his own investments while in office, as doesthe Queen. I can see why the Queen and Prince Philip enjoy the company ofFarish. His grandfather, William Farish senior, was the president of theRockefellers’ Standard Oil of New Jersey during the Second World War when it wassupplying oil and technological know-how to the Nazis and their chemical giantI. G. Farben which operated the slave camp at Auchwitz. Indeed Standard Oil andI. G. Farben were basically the same company. …And The Truth Shall Set You Freewill give you the background to all this. Wherever you look, the Windsors can’tseem to avoid Nazis, Nazi sympathisers and supporters.The Windsor genocideThe numerous Anglo-Dutch alliances and intrigues are, in truth, nothing to dowith the British and Dutch people. If we are going to stop being duped, we haveto stop screaming “It’s the British”, “It’s the Dutch”, “It’s the Americans”,“It’s the Germans”, “Its the French”, “It’s the whites”, “It’s the blacks”,“It’s the Jews”, or even “It’s the reptilians”. It is not all these peoples thatare involved, it is certain bloodlines and factions within them. Blaming onerace, nation or belief system is precisely what the Brotherhood want us to do,because if people are divided amongst themselves they will become disunited,quarrelsome or even warring factions. Divide and rule. Manipulation comes from anetwork of bloodlines and their ‘gofers’ who work through all these countriesand groups while keeping the population in ignorance. The close cooperationbetween ‘Britain’ and the ‘Netherlands’ means the British and Dutch wings of theBlack Nobility. This is definitely the case with Prince Philip, the consort ofthe Queen of England, and Prince Bernhard, the consort of Queen Juliana of theNetherlands until she stepped down for her daughter, Beatrix. Philip andBernhard are from the same reptilian bloodline and both have a Nazi view of lifeand people. Philip and his family are steeped in Nazi connections and Bernhardwas a member of Himmler’s murderous SS. He was born a German in 1912, thecousin-inlaw of Princess Victoria of Hohenzollern, the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm(Ramses-Piso-Bush). He was recruited into Nazi Intelligence at the University ofBerlin in 1934 and worked for the SS operation within I. G. Farben, the chemicalgiant which had such close connections with the Rockefeller/Farish Standard Oiland British companies like ICI. Bernhard’s background caused a scandal in theNetherlands when he married Queen Juliana of the infamous House of Orange, tobecome the Netherlands equivalent of his bosom buddy, Prince Philip. Bernhardhelped to found the Bilderberg Group which officially met for the first time in1954, and in 1961 he cofounded, with Philip, the World Wildlife Fund (now theWorld Wide Fund For Nature), funded in part by the Mellons.Lets get one thing straight here. The World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) was notcreated to save endangered species. Its record on that front is quite appallingas a suppressed report by the Oxford professor John Phillipson revealed in1989.42 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457585] A few months before Philiplaunched the WWF, he was with the Queen on a royal tour of India. This includeda tiger shoot in which a tiger was lured into range by tethered goats to be shotdead by Philip the ‘conservationist’.43[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457760] This later caused worldwideoutrage when the story and a photograph of Philip standing over the tiger foundits way into the newspapers. On the same tour, this time in Kathmandu, Philipwas in a shooting party with Alec Douglas Hume (Lord Home), the ConservativePrime Minister, Bilderberg Group chairman and bloodline of the ScottishBrotherhood families. Ian MacPhail, the WWF’s first international appealsdirector, told a British television crew how a mother elephant and her calf cameinto range. Philip shot the mother and her calf ran off in terror. MacPhail saidhe helped to cover up the incident because the WWF was about to be launched andhe believed the Fund would benefit wildlife conservation. He later thoughtdifferently:“…with a heavy heart I have to report that I was wrong. The rhino, the elephantand the panda missed the boat, and the new Noah’s Ark sailed on without them.”44[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457850]It has always mystified the public to see the contradiction between Philip, thefounder and driving force behind the WWF, and Philip the killer of animals andbirds for the sheer enjoyment of it. The same with WWF ‘conservationist’ PrinceCharles riding with the hounds to tear a fox to pieces. But there is nocontradiction, that’s the point. Philip, like Bernard, doesn’t give a stuffabout animal welfare. The WWF was created for very different reasons. It is avehicle for controlling wildlife parks in Africa and elsewhere in whichterrorist groups and mercenaries can gather, train, and cross borders to bringgenocide to places like Rwanda and Burundi. The WWF coordinates and funds thesystematic slaughter of people and animals and has made a fortune from theillegal trade in ivory it was supposed to be trying to stop. Much of this isbeing paid for by donations from the public who think they are supportingwildlife and collected by fund-raisers in the towns and cities who believe thesame. The best contribution you can make to the protection of wildlife is tostop funding the WWF in my view. Sir Peter Scott, the celebratedconservationist, was another founder of the WWF and in 1972 he commissioned areport by a big game hunter, Ian Parker, into the illegal trade in elephanttusks and rhino horn. Parker produced evidence that the family of the KenyanPresident, Jomo Kenyatta, was at the centre of this trade. He also named Kenya’smost prominent ‘conservationists’ as the poachers. Within hours of handing hisreport to Scott, Parker was arrested by Kenyan Special Branch, beaten for threedays, and told if he did not shut up his wife would be killed.45[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1457934] Parker’s report was neverpublished by Scott and at around the same time Prince Bernhard, as WWFInternational President, awarded Kenyatta the ‘Order of the Golden Ark’ forsaving the rhino!46 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458024]I need do no more than list some of the names in the WWF’s 1001 Club to showwhere this organisation is really coming from. This is an exclusive group,formed by Prince Bernhard in 1971, to raise money for the WWF’s ‘activities’.The members, recruited by invitation only as with all the Brotherhood secretsocieties, give a large annual donation. Here is a flavour of the membership ofthe 1001 Club over the years:Conrad Black: agent for British Intelligence and head of the Hollinger mediaempire which was originally formed by his father, George, a British Intelligenceoperative. Black is a member of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group;Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis (deceased): one of the most prominentVenetian families of the Black Nobility and the Holy Roman Empire. Closeassociate of the Rothschilds. His father, Max, founded Hitler’s Allgemeine SSwhich had its headquarters at the family’s Regensburg Castle in Bavaria, home ofthe Bavarian Illuminati; Tibor Rosenbaum (deceased): Mossad logistics operativeand head of the Geneva-based Banque du Credit International (BCI), theforerunner to the notorious BCCI which was dubbed the Bank of Crooks andCriminals. Life magazine exposed Rosenbaum’s bank as a money launderer for theMeyer Lansky US-based organised crime network and Rosenbaum was also a backer ofPermindex, the assassination unit of British Intelligence which was at thecentre of the assassination of John F. Kennedy (see …And the Truth Shall Set YouFree); Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield (deceased): British Intelligence agentwho fronted the Permindex operation; Robert Vesco: sponsored by the Swiss branchof the Rothschilds and part of the American connection to the Medellin drugcartel in Colombia. Last heard of on the run, possibly in Cuba; Henry Keswick,chairman of Jardine Matheson, one of the biggest drug running operations on theplanet. His brother, John Keswick, a backer of the WWF, is chairman of HambrosBank and a director of the Bank of England; Sir Francis de Guingand, former headof British Military Intelligence, now living in South Africa; Sir KennethKleinwort: a member of the banking family behind Kleinwort Benson; King JuanCarlos of Spain: Black Nobility and founder and president of honour ofWWF-Spain; Prince Henrik: President of WWF-Denmark; Dr Luc Hoffman:vice-president of WWF International and director of the Swiss pharmaceuticalcompany Hoffman-LaRoche; John H. Loudon: chairman of Shell Oil until 1976 andchief executive of Royal Dutch Shell. Given knighthoods by both the British andDutch royal families and Bernhard’s successor in 1977 as International Presidentof WWF.47 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458108]Yes, sounds like a bunch of conservationists, doesn’t it? Martin Palmer, anadvisor to Philip on environmental matters, said the WWF was a “missionaryorganisation”.48 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458249] It is, too. Thefirst wave of missionaries began the destruction of Africa and South and CentralAmerica, and now the latest wave, in the guise of operations like the WWF, areseeking to finish the job. The environment is being used as a central plank inthe Brotherhood Agenda and I speak as someone who saw the movement from withinwhen I was a national spokesman for the British Green Party in the late 1980s.To those who condemn environmentalists as ‘ecofascists’ I can tell you that,like all the organisations used by the Brotherhood, including the Freemasons,the vast majority would be horrified at the thought of playing a part in theAgenda I am exposing. Most of them are decent people, incredibly naive andsometimes incredibly arrogant, but certainly not fascists. Once again it is themanipulating core who are fascists that we have to identify and we won’t do thatby screaming abuse at everyone who talks about conservation. The same is true ofthe so-called New Age movement which is being manipulated beyond belief. One ofthe New Age heroes is the Dalai Lama, yet another world figure who is not whathe seems to be. Nancy Nash, the former director of the WWF, was transferred tobecome the Dalai Lama’s minder and controller. In …And The Truth Shall Set YouFree, I detail the manipulation of the global environmental movement throughorganisations like the Club of Rome and individuals like the Canadian oilmillionaire (and the rest), Maurice Strong. Not surprisingly, Strong has been amember of the WWF 1001 Club and so has Alexander King, the co-founder of theClub of Rome in 1968 with Aurelio Peccei, the Fiat executive and number two toGiovanni Agnelli, one of the foremost members of the Black Nobility and an innercircle member of the Bilderberg Group. Strong is also close to the Dalai Lamaand an advisor to Kofi Annan, Secretary-general of the United Nations.The environment is being used in many ways to further the Agenda throughproblem-reaction-solution. If you are looking to impose global ‘solutions’ youneed global ‘problems’ and the environment is perfect for that. It allows you topass international laws and create centralised, global organisations to policethem. It allows you to move native peoples from their ancient lands to createwildlife parks and ‘conservation’ areas all over the world, particularly Africaand the Americas, which then come under your centralised control. It gives youfootholds in strategic areas from which you can launch ‘freedom fighters’ tostart civil wars. The advantages are endless. Transnational agreements like theBiodiversity Treaty are handing control of large tracts of land in the UnitedStates and elsewhere to United Nations control.49[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458463] The situation is the same as inAfrica where the parks are administered by outside agencies over which thepeople have no control. The ‘Global Biodiversity Strategy’ was launched by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) the Swiss-basedorganisation formed by Sir Julian Huxley in 1948 with a constitution written bythe British Foreign Office. This sits at the centre of a network connecting 68countries, 103 government agencies and 640 non-government organisations. Itworked with others like the Rockefeller-funded World Resources Institute in theUnited States headed by Lester Brown (CFR), and its strategy was presented atthe 1992 Rio Earth Summit by… Maurice Strong, the Windsor-Black Nobilityleg-man, who with his wife, is also seeking to play the same scam with the NewAge Movement. One of his vehicles for this is the Dalai Lama.The Club of Rome was formed by the Brotherhood at the Rockefeller estate inItaly in 1968 to launch the environmental movement on the world. All the majorglobal environmental reports saying there is an environmental crisis andsomething must be done, have been funded and fronted by the very people who aredismantling the planet’s ecology and killing the wildlife. Maurice Strong is amajor voice in the Club of Rome. Canada is still a Commonwealth country and itacts as a massive centre for Windsor-Black Nobility operations. This is why somany Canadians, including Strong, Conrad Black, the Bronfman gangster family,and prime ministers like Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney, are involved in thegame. Strong is also part of the Rockefeller organisation, leadingrepresentatives of the Windsor-Black Nobility in the United States. Strongserved with the Rockefeller Foundation which shares a common leadership with allthe other ‘independent’ foundations in the United States like Ford and Carnegie.His main role in the past 20 years, however, has been to front the manipulationof the environmental movement. Who was the first head of the United NationsEnvironment Agency? Maurice Strong. Who was the head of the 1992 Earth Summit inBrazil? Maurice Strong. Who compiled the highly influential environmental reportcalled Our Common Future, better known as the Bruntland Report? Maurice Strong’sCanadian associate, Jim MacNeil, an ‘advisor’ to the Rio Summit. Who compiledthe document called Global 2000, Report To The President, during the Carteradministration in America? Cyrus Vance (CFR, TC, Bil) and other Brotherhoodpersonnel. Strong is a member of the infamous Aspen Institute in Colorado formedby the Bilderberger Robert O. Anderson of Atlantic Richfield Oil (ARCO). Hiscompany has a pyramid with a missing capstone as its logo. Anderson was a funderof the environmental group, Friends of the Earth, which, at the highest level,interlocks with others like Greenpeace, WWF, the Sierra Club, SurvivalInternational, Earth First, World Resources Institute, the Zoological Society ofLondon, Royal Geographical Society, Nature Conservancy, the Flora and FaunaPreservation Society, the United Nations Education, Scientific and CulturalOrganisation (UNESCO), and many, many others. These provide another web ofnational and international agencies through which to organise covert operationswhich often have no connection to ‘conservation’.The assault on Africa and other developing countries by Prince Philip and hisWWF is part of an ongoing operation. The Royal Geographical Society, which wasfounded in 1830 and given a royal charter in 1859, sponsored the expeditionsinto Africa of Doctor David Livingstone and Sir Richard Burton which helped toopen up the continent to exploitation and takeover by the European BlackNobility. When the European invasion of Africa began it was also achievedthrough organisations chartered by the British Crown, including the BritishSouth Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes, the British East Africa Company and theRoyal Niger Company. The operation was a mirror of what happened in America withthe Virginia Company. One of the leading lights in the Royal GeographicalSociety in the last century was Francis Galton, founder of the eugenics (masterrace) movement which continues today under the heading of ‘population control’.This is a favourite theme of Prince Philip and his American paedophile andSatanist friend George Bush (see …And The Truth Shall Set You Free). TheZoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles, theBrotherhood’s Viceroy of India and founder of Singapore. Prince Philip is aformer president of this organisation and it connects with the ZoologicalSociety of New York and Frankfurt, two other major Brotherhood centres. Theboards of these two organisations and the WWF are virtually the same.The Sierra Club was founded in 1892 by John Muir with funding from the Americanbloodline family, the Harrimans, who also funded Galton’s eugenics movement. Itwas the leaders of the Sierra Club in Canada who started Greenpeace in 1971 andDavid Ross Brower, former executive director of the Sierra Club, was the founderof Friends of the Earth in 1969. Ross Brower moved to England in 1970 withfunding from Rothschild interests, the billionaire financier and Rothschildcousin James Goldsmith, and the zoo owner John Aspinall, who, with Goldsmith,was a close friend of Lord Lucan, the missing earl still wanted for the murderof the family nanny. Friends of the Earth reached its peak of prominence inBritain under the directorship of Jonathan Porritt, the son of the formerBritish governor-general of New Zealand, and later an advisor to Prince Charles.Porritt attended the Bilderberg meeting in Sintra, Portugal in June 1999. Thefounder of FOE in France, Brice LaLonde, was a partner in a Rockefeller law firmand became environment minister to the French president, the high levelFreemason and friend of the Rothschilds, Francois Mitterrand, under whose reignthe black glass pyramid was erected alongside the Louvre Museum. As with PrincePhilip, people were surprised when the late Sir James Goldsmith became a ‘bornagain’ environmentalist after a lifetime of financial manipulation and‘investment’ which served both the Brotherhood Agenda and devastated theenvironment. Again, there are no contradictions when you understand the planthey are working to. Goldsmith, formerly Goldschmidt, had a German-Englishfather and a French mother. His father, Frank, was a friend of Winston Churchilland became a Conservative MP. The Goldschmidts had joined forces with otherRothschild cousins, the Bischoffsheims, to form a banking partnership whichfinanced the North in the American Civil War.50[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458619] Goldsmith’s family were part ofthe Black Nobility financial web in Europe and there is no doubting the sourceof Goldsmith’s ‘inspiration’ when he suddenly sold all his stocks just beforethe enormous stockmarket crash of 1987. He further served the Brotherhood bylaunching the Referendum Party in Britain to hijack the anti-European Unionopposition and lead it to failure. It also split the Conservative vote in keyconstituencies which helped the Brotherhood choice, Tony Blair, to become PrimeMinister. Part of this strategy involved the former Conservative PartyTreasurer, the Satanist and paedophile, Lord McAlpine, making a very publictransfer to Goldsmith’s party and he later became its leader. Goldsmith’s elderbrother Edward, ‘Teddy’, founded The Ecologist magazine and has connections withthe WWF. According to published reports, Teddy and James Goldsmith have long hadclose ties with the Wall Street banker, John Train, the brother of RussellTrain, the president of WWF USA. Russell Train is also the top trustee of theAfrican Wildlife Foundation, and intimate of Prince Philip and George Bush. JohnTrain comes from a bloodline family and his grandfather was a founder of the J.P. Morgan banking group. He married into the Venetian Cini family and his, nowdivorced, wife was the daughter of Vittorio Cini who played a major role in thefascist movement in Italy in the 1930s. Train has deep ties with theintelligence community and is a ‘gofer’ for both Bush and the Windsors.51[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458737]The environmental network is just part of the web through which Prince Philipand his WWF genocide operations can work and I stress most emphatically thatmost of those who work for and support the WWF are genuine people who have noidea of the Agenda they are unwittingly serving. The Crown companies which stoleAfrica from its people in the 19th century spawned many of their modern dayequivalents who continue what people like Cecil Rhodes began. The Lonrho(London-Rhodesia) company, headed most famously by the late Tiny Rowland, was asubsidiary of Rhodes’ British South Africa Company and has been responsible formuch of the genocide and war in Africa which has kept the people divided andruled. At the time of writing, Lonrho has 640 subsidiaries in 48 countries. Itis the biggest food producer in Africa, the biggest distributor of motorvehicles, and the biggest producer of textiles. It even produces 90% of British,sorry, Her Majesty’s, postage stamps.52[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1458886] Tiny Rowland was little more thana figurehead to take the blame for what the Queen and the Windsors wereorchestrating on behalf of the Black Nobility. The real power behind theupgrading and expansion of Lonrho was Harley Drayton, the personal financialmanager to the British Crown, and Angus Ogilvy, the husband of PrincessAlexandra, the Queen’s first cousin.53[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459016] Contacts in Canada tell me thatOgilvy is very active there too, in the Windsor operations. Princess Alexandrais the head of WWF-UK.54 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459100] Otherexploiters of the great African continent today include Rio Tinto,Anglo-American, Minorco, De Beers, Barclays, Shell, N. M. Rothschild, ImperialChemical Industries (ICI), and Unilever, all, or most of whom, are reported toenjoy substantial investments by the Queen. Incidentally, Lord Melchett, thegrandson of the founder of ICI, a pillar of the world chemical cartel, becamehead of Greenpeace, United Kingdom. The three biggest mining companies in theworld, Anglo-American, Rio Tinto, and Minorco, are in truth the same operation.Minorco is the international holding company for the Oppenheimer empire, thefamily which have monopolised the world diamond market with the Rothschildsthrough De Beers, the company established by Cecil Rhodes in 1880. Twentydirectors of Minorco are also directors of Anglo-American, which is also full ofDe Beers personnel.The destruction of Africa can be described in three distinct phases. First theinvasion and overt control of the continent by the Black Nobility branches ofEurope, the British, Dutch, Belgians, Germans, Portuguese and French. Then camethe transition from colonial rule by physical occupation to rule by financialoccupation via corrupt presidents and prime ministers imposed by theBrotherhood. Anyone seeking power who will not play the game is removed byassassination, scandal or coup. The faces change, but the masters stay the same.Rhodesia became Zimbabwe under the manipulation of Britain’s Margaret Thatcher(Bil) and Lord Carrington (RIIA, TC, Bil, Comm 300), but all that happened wasthat the white dictatorship of Ian Smith was replaced by the dictatorship ofRobert Mugabe, a black ‘royal’ bloodline going back to the reptilianinterbreeding, according to Credo Mutwa. He says that the black leaders of‘post-colonial’ Africa are invariably the ‘royal’ bloodlines. The lives of thepeople of Africa have not changed because the same people are still in control.Only now its more difficult to spot them because they work behind the scenes.The third phase of this African operation is to turn the continent into abloodbath which will destroy all coherent society and justify the imposition ofrule by NATO and United Nations ‘peacekeepers’. The environment is being used asan excuse to steal more and more land and the debt crisis is being ‘solved’ bythe banks of the Brotherhood offering to forgive ‘debt’ in return for the rightsto the mineral resources – forever.The mass murder in places like Algeria, Rwanda and Burundi is not spontaneous,it has been organised in great detail, just as the conflict and genocide in theformer Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, etc, have been. In…And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I reveal the background to many of theseconflicts. The International Red Cross (red cross, the Templar/Phoeniciansymbol) have been caught supplying arms to the Tamil Rebels in Sri Lanka and theZapatista rebels in Mexico.55 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459184] TheRed Cross, as I document in …And The Truth, is a front for the Brotherhood,although its genuine employees and volunteers have no knowledge of this. Youdon’t need an intelligence test to know why Elizabeth Dole, the wife of BobDole, has been head of the Red Cross in America. Other apparently genuineorganisations like Oxfam and Amnesty International are also used for Brotherhoodmanipulation. Afghan Aid UK was a vehicle through which the Mujahideenterrorists were organised and deployed to trigger the war in Afghanistan.56[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459326] It was headed by ViscountCranborne (Robert Cecil). The Cecil family are one of the oldest Black Nobilitybloodlines in Britain and were most active in the time of Cecil Rhodes. RobertCecil’s great-great-grandfather was the Third Marquess of Salisbury, the primeminister who helped to manipulate the outbreak of the First World War. Anotherintelligence operative involved in the creation of the Afghanistan war was LordBethell, the Lord in Waiting to the Queen, who ran Radio Free Kabul.57[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459420] The Windsor-Black Nobility covertoperations create the ‘terrorist’ groups and ‘freedom fighters’ then light thefuse and watch hundreds of thousands of people, sometimes millions, beslaughtered. They can rely on their media barons like Black, Murdoch, Turner andPacker to sell the public a smokescreen story through ‘journalists’ who mostlyhaven’t got a clue what is happening.Game reserves and national parks already account for more than eight per cent ofthe land in sub-Saharan Africa and in Tanzania it is 40%.58[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459510] Under some of these lands arefantastic reserves of mineral resources and in some cases untapped reserves ofuranium. The ‘parks’ are often in strategic areas across borders and those whoadministrate them can keep out anyone they choose. Who administrates them?Agencies like Prince Philip’s WWF and other Brotherhood organisations such asthe International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the UN Food andAgriculture Organisation, and the UN Development Programme. They employ militaryand intelligence personnel to do this and as such they are subverting thesovereignty of the African nations. Two horrifying examples are OperationStronghold and Operation Lock. Stronghold was supposed to be supporting theZimbabwe Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management to save 700 blackrhinos in the Zambezi Valley, but it emerged that the Chief Game Ranger GlenTatham and his staff were simply killing ‘poachers’ without warning. Officialfigures show that between July 1984 and September 1991, 145 ‘poachers’ werekilled, most of them from a helicopter funded by Prince Philip’s WWF and mannedby WWF contract employees.59 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459675] Butwhen you look at the figures more closely, you find that the overwhelmingmajority of those killed were unarmed! Why no prosecutions then? Because whenthe story first came to light a bill was rushed through the Zimbabwe Parliamentcalled the Protection of Wildlife (Indemnity) Act which gave the game wardensimmunity from prosecution.60 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459835] TheWWF was now able to kill whoever it liked whenever it liked in the reserves. InOperation Lock, the WWF deployed an élite squad of SAS men to ‘neutralise’ thecartels smuggling wildlife and wildlife ‘products’. It turned out that these SASguys had started to deal themselves in the illegal sale of ivory and rhinohorn.61 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1459919] People on the ground inAfrica have long known that the main killers of wildlife in the parks are those,often employed by the WWF, who are supposed to be protecting them.The Operation Lock scandal erupted in late 1989 and early 1990 and it shouldalso be noted that, as with Operation Stronghold, the arrival of the SAScoincided with a rapid rise in the number of dead ‘poachers’. This is notsurprising given that the training of ‘élite’ squads such as the SAS, theParachute Regiment, the Green Berets, the Delta Force, and such like, isdesigned to turn out fully qualified psychopaths. The organisation of the WWF’sOperation Lock was headed by Colonel David Stirling, the founder of the SASduring World War Two. He formed a company for the operation which he named KASEnterprises, a name inspired by his membership of the Capricorn Africa Society(CAS), which in the words of the governor of Kenya Sir Philip Kerr, was createdto ‘preserve apartheid in a sugar coating’.62[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460009] The treasurer of Capricorn AfricaSociety, Mervyn Cowrie, was the man behind the Kenyan park system along withElspeth Huxley. She married into the family of Julian Huxley, the inspirationbehind the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the architects of‘biodiversity’, and an organisation with a constitution written by the BritishForeign Office. The interconnecting web is incredible. The Queen and PrincePhilip knew exactly what Stirling’s SAS assault team were going to do inOperation Lock. Stirling is extremely close to the Windsors and played asignificant role in the Queen’s Coronation ceremony under the title of the‘Golden Stick’.63 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460099] As a Scottisharistocrat, Stirling was particularly close to the Queen Mother, another BlackNobility Scottish bloodline who is certainly not the person she appears to be inher public charade as the nation’s ‘grandma’. Stirling, along with all membersof the SAS, MI5, MI6 and so on, swears his oath of loyalty to the monarch, notthe state. You can’t even take your seat as a British MP unless you make thesame pledge even though you have been elected by the people. Stirling admittedhe had been in close contact with the British Defence and Foreign Ministries,two other links in the Windsor-Brotherhood chain. Stirling’s operational officerin KAS and Operation Lock was Lt Colonel Ian Crooke, one of the hooded men onthe balcony when his SAS team stormed the Iranian Embassy in London in May 1980,while millions watched on live television.64[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460193] People like this were employed byPrince Philip and his WWF to protect wildlife in Africa? No, no, they were thereas part of the Windsor-Black Nobility operation to turn Africa into a devastatedblood bath. The wildlife parks are used as safe havens for theBrotherhood-Windsor-sponsored terrorists responsible for so much genocide inAfrica. Nearly 20 per cent of Rwanda is covered by these reserves. The 1990invasion of Rwanda by the ‘Rwanda Patriotic Front’ (RPF) came via the GorillaPark and Akagera Park in Uganda on the Rwanda-Zaire border, and the Volcans Parkin Rwanda.The RPF (a British-controlled terrorist force) were also based in parts of theVirunga Park in Zaire.65 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460283] A fewmonths before these events, a ‘gorilla protection programme’ had begun in theVirunga, Gorilla and Volcan Parks. This programme was administered by… the WWF.In 1994 the ‘Rwanda Patriotic Front’ invaded Rwanda via the Akagera Park totrigger a conflict which has so far killed well in excess of a million people. Iunderstand the violence began shortly after a ‘diplomatic mission’ to Rwanda byHenry Kissinger and Lord Carrington and it followed the sale of weapons toRwanda by the Israeli government, then headed by Yitzhak Rabin. In truth thisinvasion was not by the ‘Rwanda Patriotic Front’ (RPF) at all. Almost everymember of that group was a soldier in the ‘National Resistance Army’ (NRA) ofUganda’s President Museveni. The leaders of both the RFP and the NRA are thesame! The Rwanda Patriotic Front’s David Tinyefuza was the Ugandan Minister forDefence, whilst Paul Kagame the Rwanda Defence Minister under the RPF was headof Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence in the Ugandan army, and the RPF’sChris Bunyenyezi is the former commander of the Ugandan army’s murderous 306thBrigade.66 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460460] The same crowd underMuseveni were involved in the attempted coup in Burundi in 1993 in whichPresident Melchior Ndadaye was murdered and an estimated 100,000 people losttheir lives.67 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460544] Another aspect ofthis policy in Africa, and Central and South America, is to reduce thepopulation of what Henry Kissinger calls the “useless eaters”. The genocide inAfrica is being coordinated to a large extent out of Uganda which has long beencontrolled by the Windsor-Black Nobility cartels of banking, business andintelligence agencies. The British Minister of Overseas Development at the timewas Margaret Thatcher’s favourite, Lynda Chalker, who had a number of meetingswith Museveni and his officials. South Africa with the end of Nelson Mandela’spresidency is going to be a major target for those who are working to turn blackagainst black to justify the intervention of the white peace keepers. Hissuccessor, Thabo Mbeki, is a Brotherhood clone to his bootstraps. We have seenonly the start of the problems in the African continent: it is time for thepeople there to open their eyes.Exactly the same operation is being played out in the Americas and Australiawhere the same names and techniques are there to see. In South and CentralAmerica, Brotherhood-controlled governments are ‘privatising’ their mineral andmining companies and handing them to the Black Nobility-Windsor cartels,particularly Rio Tinto, Anglo-American, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining. BarrickGold, based in Toronto, was formed in 1981 by Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudifinancier and global arms trader and the uncle of Dodi Fayed. Peter Munk,formerly with the British royal household, became chairman of Barrick whichappeared from nowhere to be the second biggest gold producer in the world.68[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460635] One reason for this was the activeinvolvement of the George Bush-Harriman networks. Khashoggi was a backer ofPresident Bush’s Iran-Contra drug-for-arms operation (see …And The Truth ShallSet You Free). Newmont Mining is based in Denver, Colorado, a highlysignificant, and growing, Brotherhood centre. It appears to be an Americancompany, but is once again controlled from London. It has been owned by theHanson group who sold it to James Goldsmith. He sold 14% to George Soros, one ofthe Brotherhood’s most active and identifiable financial manipulators,especially on behalf of the Rothschilds. Other shareholders in Newmont are LordJacob Rothschild, the Fidelity Mutual Fund (with its pyramid and sun symbol),and Boston-based drug syndicates.69[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460837] Alongside the assault on SouthAmerica by the mineral corporations has come the takeover of the continent’sbanking system by the City of London cartel, led by HSBS (Hong Kong and ShanghaiBank which owns Midland Bank) and their interlocking American and Canadiancounterparts like Citibank, the Bank of Montreal, and the Bank of Nova Scotia orScotiabank.70 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1460928]The Queen is Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces in the United Kingdom andthe countries of the Commonwealth. The British army is deployed in manystrategic parts of the world either directly or via the NATO and UN peacekeepingoperations. British military ‘advisors’ are at work in some 30 countries. Everyweek the Queen is briefed by the Joint Intelligence Committee on all secretoperations. (I wonder if she briefs them on hers?) The Windsor-Black Nobilityhas its own private armies, too. Among these are the Corps of Commissionairesand Defence Systems Ltd. The Corps of Commissionaires was formed, like CrownAgents, under royal sponsorship in 1859 when the British Empire was at the peakof its powers. The idea, so they said, was to find employment for soldierscoming home from the Crimean War and a number were deployed as armed anduninformed security guards at the Black Nobility buildings in the City ofLondon. Branches followed in Australia, South and East Africa, New Zealand andCanada. Another network had been created to post British military personnel andtheir families to strategic centres. After the election of Margaret Thatcher in1979, the Corps of Commissionaires was reorganised and a new division wasestablished to provide ‘specialist security functions’. More members of themilitary and paramilitary élite were employed and the Queen, the Patron of theCorps of Commissionaires, hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace in 1986 tocelebrate the expansion. The Corp’s Board of Governors in every country werefull of the loyal friends of the Queen and Prince Philip. These included MajorGeneral David Alexander, Companion of the Bath and former Equerry and Treasurerto Philip, and Air Marshall Sir Thomas Kennedy, Knight Grand Cross of the Bath,Commander of the British Empire, the former Commander-in-Chief of the RoyalAirforce in Germany. He was Aide-de-camp to the Queen between 1983 and 86. TheCorps of Commissionaires is a Windsor operation through and through. It won’t bea shock to learn, therefore, that the Corps is an umbrella organisation forhired killers. Some of the companies in its network are Sandline Ltd, ExecutiveOutcomes and Defence Systems Ltd. Like the Corps of Commissionaires these areLondon-based and employ from the Special Air Services (SAS) and the military andpolice forces in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. The Corps have apermanent office in Papua New Guinea and the government there was voted fromoffice in 1994 for negotiating a contract with Sandline International to use itsmercenaries to put down a local insurgency. Sandline, in turn, subcontracted toDefence Systems Ltd (DSL), which has private and government contracts in morethan 40 countries. It is employed by almost all the City of London cartels, theClub of the Isles, and has branches in Washington, Jacksonville, Hong Kong,Singapore, Bogata, Lima, Maputo, Kinshasa, Luanda, Port Moresby, Moscow,Kazakhstan, Jersey and Sarajevo.71 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461092]Sandline was behind the coup in Sierra Leone which removed a legitimatelyelected government shortly after they cancelled a $20 million a year contractwith the company.72 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461240] This alsotriggered the inquiry into illegal arms sales to Sierra Leone by Britishsuppliers through the Sandline network. A debt of some $16 million owed toSandline by Sierra Leone before the coup, was paid by turning over diamondconcessions to Executive Outcomes’ London underwriters, Branch Energy.73[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461324] This firm is owned by TonyBuckingham of Sandline International and yet another former member of the SAS.74[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461408] He had pulled the samediamonds-for-mercenaries ‘arrangement’ on Angola and he floated theseconcessions on the Vancouver stock-market as a company called Diamond Works.75[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461492] Another business partner of TonyBuckingham is David Steel, the former leader of the British Liberal Party andAnti-Apartheid Movement, and a member of the Queen’s Privy Council.76[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461576] Steel’s Heritage Oil and Gasshares London offices with Branch Energy.77[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461660]In Sarajevo and the former Yugoslavia it has been working in conjunction withthe Queen’s agency, the Crown Agents. Defence Systems Ltd has substantialcontracts with the United Nations, the World Bank, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, S. G.Warburg, Credit Suisse, Robert Fleming, Kleinwort Benson, British Airways,Cadbury Schweppes, Jardine Matheson, Rothmans, the Rothschilds, Exxon, Mobil,Amoco, Texaco, Chevron, Brown and Root, General Motors, Coca Cola, andBechell.78 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461744] A directory of theBlack Nobility if ever I saw one. Defence Systems Ltd was established in 1981,again the early years of the Thatcher regime, and its rise was meteoric thanksto its supporters and patrons. At one point in 1980 it was a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Hambros Bank.79 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461892] Thefirst managing director of DSL was Alestair Morrison, Order of the BritishEmpire, the former number two in the 22nd regiment of the SAS. The firstchairman was Major General Viscount Gilbert Monckton of Brenchley, Companion ofthe Bath, Order of the British Empire, and former chief of staff of the BritishArmy of the Rhine. His father was in Winston Churchill’s cabinet and chairman ofMidland Bank, and his son was editor of The Daily Telegraph (Hollinger/BritishIntelligence) Sunday Magazine and advisor to Margaret Thatcher. Philip Warner ofthe shipping company P & O was another founding director of Defence Systems anda later chief executive was Richard N. Bethell, another former SAS officer. Hisfather, Lord Nicholas Bethell, was an agent with British Intelligence (MI6) andLord-in-Waiting to the Queen. He was involved in the manipulation of the war inAfghanistan through the 1980s and the terrorist organisations which have comefrom that. Defence Systems interlocks with a similar company, Control Risks, avery important part of the network founded in 1974 to serve Lloyds of London.80[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1461983] The managing director of ControlRisks is Major Arish Turle, former SAS, and among its directors is General SirJohn Stanier, former Commander in Chief of UK land forces andAide-de-Camp-General to the Queen. Lord Soames, the senior Tory politician andson-in-law to Winston Churchill, is another Control Risks director. Soames was‘advisor’ to Prince Charles at the time that Princess Diana gave her outspokeninterview with the BBC programme Panorama. Soames, (nicknamed ‘fatty’),questioned her mental state. I’ve got a feeling she was rather more mentallystable than Soames, somehow. In that Panorama interview Diana spoke in a waythat no insider ever has about the Windsors. According to Stephen Dorrill in hisbook, The Secret Conspiracy, Inside The Secret Service In The 90s, Control Risksis the most important of the private secret services operated by the Queen’sPrivy Council.81 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1462067]Defence Systems was bought by the American company Armor Holdings for $26million. Armor is a front company for the George Bush circle and the idea was togive Defence Systems an ‘American’ owner to allow expansion into the UnitedStates security market. Body Armor and Equipment Inc. was a small family-ownedcompany until it went bankrupt in 1992 and was reorganised as Armor Holdings bythe introduction of Wall Street investors and Windsor associates. One director,Richard C. Bartlett, is chairman and trustee of the Nature Conservancy of Texaswhich was founded by the British Privy Council in 1946. One of the companiesusing Defence Systems in South America is British Petroleum who employ ControlRisks. BP is one of the most unpleasant business operations on the planet and afront for the British Foreign Office, British Intelligence and The Crown.British Petroleum is a jewel of the Brotherhood and the Windsor cartels and soit is only understandable that they would use the Brotherhood-Windsor ‘security’network. The BP chairman, Sir David Simon, was invited to join the government ofgolden boy Tony Blair after he became Prime Minister on May 1st 1997. Simon isalso director of the Bank of England, Grand Metropolitan, Rio Tinto, AllianceAG, and a member of the International Advisory Council of the Deutche Bank.82[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1462229] His role in the government is for‘European affairs’ and this is Blair-speak for ensuring that Britain becomes amember of the European single currency and central bank and therefore loses allpower to govern itself. Simon was replaced as head of BP by Peter D. Sutherland(Bil), a notorious Brotherhood front man, the former head of the World TradeOrganisation. Another company I should mention with regard to the manipulationof Africa and the Americas is Transparency International which is a member ofthe Crown Agents Foundation and has the managing director of the Crown Agents onits own board. Transparency International is used to destabilise governmentsunder the guise of exposing corruption.83[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1462358]These interconnecting ‘security’ companies operating world-wide are the privatearmy of the Windsors and the Black Nobility based in the City of London. Wantsome trouble in Africa to advance your Agenda. No problem. Where do you fancy,Rwanda? Algeria? The Congo? How about South America? Where do you fancy?Bolivia? Peru? These are part of the network being developed for a plannedglobal coup some time in the not too distant future. Confirmation that the RoyalFamily are close to the intelligence agencies and operate outside the‘democratic’ process came in an interview given by Colonel David Stirling, thefounder of the SAS, who worked for Prince Philip’s World Wide Fund for Nature inAfrican covert operations. Before he died, he told the authors of the book WhoKilled Diana?, 84 [../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1462494] that in late1974 or early 1975 he attended a dinner at a royal palace hosted by a seniormember of the monarchy. Prince Philip I would guess. Prince Charles’ uncle, LordMountbatten, was also there along with ten representatives of BritishIntelligence including the heads of MI5 and MI6. They were there in anunofficial capacity and Stirling pointed out that all military officers sworeallegiance to the Queen and regarded her as the ultimate authority, moreimportant than elected governments. The meeting was called to discuss the stateof the country and the need for intervention in political affairs. The use offorce was on the agenda, he said. Stirling told the meeting of his involvementin an operation to create a coup d’état in Libya and at the time he was theleader of an organisation called GB75 which was designed to take over publicservices in times of crisis. John Mitchell, the chairman of the shipping companyCunard, also confirmed that he had been approached to take part in a coupbecause they wanted his ships. One of the orchestrators was Sir BasilSmallpiece, financial advisor to the Queen. Mitchell said:“They asked me to take part in a coup. They said it would involve the army. Theyimplied it had the highest backing… I went out of there in a state of shock.”85[../Text/index_split_045.html#filepos1462660]Yet people still believe that the idea of secret groups manipulating from theshadows is the nonsensical invention of the paranoid. In fact the evidence forthis, and the Windsors’ involvement, is overwhelming. Do we really believe thatthis Windsor-Intelligence agency network which was planning an armed coup inBritain, would not conspire to kill Diana, Princess of Wales, when shethreatened their power? Come on. What I have outlined in this chapter is a merefraction of what there is to tell about the Windsors, the Black Nobility,fascist, reptilian family which operate from Buckingham Palace, London, onbehalf of the global network of the reptilian-Brotherhood. The Windsors havebeen responsible, through their global networks, for the deaths of untoldmillions. As the Brotherhood-controlled police won’t be knocking on the door ofBuckingham Palace, it is the people who, in my view, need to impose so muchpressure on the Windsors and the establishment that they have to abdicate. Thenwe can begin to dismantle their source of power, the enormous structureheadquartered in the City of London.The Windsors in their present mode must know the game is up and they may beplanning to abdicate and move to the United States. It may even be part of theBrotherhood Agenda for them to abdicate soon, who knows? To the reptilians, theAgenda is far more important than any individual or family line, even theirs."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1330821] Thomas Foster, Britain’s RoyalThrone (Acadia Press, Victoria, Australia, 1986), p 2.2 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1332150] Samuel 10:24.3 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1333165] Britain’s Royal Throne, p 6.4 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1333883] Ibid, p 8.5 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1334820] Exodus 28:1-21.6 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1334967] Britain’s Royal Throne, p 12.7 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1335402] Ibid, p 14.8 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1335626] Psalm 89: 35-37.9 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1337902] The Curse Of Canaan, p 85.10 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1338705] In The Blood, p 62.11 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1338939] Gary Boyd Roberts, Ancestors OfThe American Presidents, New England Historic Genealogical Society.12 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1339262] Ibid.13 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1341405] The Top 13 IlluminatiBloodlines, p 99.14 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1341566] Ibid.15 [../Text/index_split_044.html#filepos1346546] The information about Philip'sNazi connections is available through many sources, but this and a catalogue ofother information about the Windsors can be found in a series of articles pulledtogether in a document called \"The True Story Behind the Fall of the House ofWindsor”.

Of that Ihave no doubt. But please don’t take my word for this. Look at the evidence andjudge for yourself.Many people dismiss the idea that Diana was assassinated because it would beimpossible to kill her in a public situation and then cover up the evidence.After all, there would need to be coordination between so many differentagencies. Well that’s precisely what happened in the United States with theassassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1963 and that was evenmore difficult to cover up. It wasn’t staged as an accident which immediatelycreates the diversion of was it an accident or was it murder? The Kennedyassassination was quite clearly murder. He literally had his brains blown out infront of hundreds of onlookers and it was captured on film by one of them,Abraham Zapruder. In …And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I feature the Kennedykilling in detail and you will see that the same people who supported orarranged the assassination were also appointed to the commission of the Chief‘Justice’ and 33rd degree Freemason, Earl Warren, to investigate what happened!Among the Warren Commission ‘team’ were Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA sackedby Kennedy, and the paedophile, rapist, Bohemian Grove member and pornographerGerald Ford, who would later become President of the United States after RichardNixon was removed by Watergate. When Representative Hale Boggs, the onlyCatholic on the Commission, began to question its findings, he died in a planecrash. How convenient.Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney, is the only man to chargeanyone with Kennedy’s murder. This was the CIA operative and former wartimefriend of Winston Churchill called Clay Shaw. Garrison failed to win aconviction against the guilty-as-hell Shaw because many of the key witnesseswere murdered before the trial. Garrison was astonished at the way apparentlyunconnected agencies, including the Dallas police, the FBI, the press, and theWashington establishment, could work so obviously as one unit to carry out theassassination and then cover it up. This was possible because of the networks Ihave been exposing in this book which have their operatives, ‘gofers’ and yesmen, in all the agencies representing all sides and shades of opinion. Gettingon for 40 years after the murder of President Kennedy in a public street on apublic occasion we are no nearer to anyone being convicted. As usual the‘culprit’ was identified immediately by those who were really responsible and hewas eliminated so he couldn’t contradict the official ‘tale’. For Lee HarveyOswald in Dealey Plaza, Dallas in 1963, read Henri Paul in the Pont de L’AlmaTunnel, Paris in 1997. Once the scapegoat has been sacrificed, no other story isentertained by the authorities and public interest wanes with the weeks, monthsand years. It’s an old and well tried technique. A President is killed in apublic assassination; Lee Harvey Oswald, the scapegoat or ‘patsy’, is murderedin public a few days later; and those who orchestrated their demise go to theirgraves unexposed and unconvicted. The Princess of Wales could not be murdered ina staged accident and the whole thing covered up? You’ve got to be kidding.As I’ve described the background to the Kennedy assassination in a previousbook, I won’t repeat it all again here, but there are elements to that storythat need to be highlighted and added to. Diana’s family, the Spencers, are ofan Elite bloodline and so are the Kennedys, who come from the Kennedy clan ofancient Ireland and later Scotland. They are descendants of the Irish king,Brian Boru, also known as Brian Caeneddi, which later became O’Kennedy. Theywere the Lords of Ormond in what is now called north Tipperary.1[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675026] From around 1600 a Scottish branchof the Kennedys can be identified and this intermarried with the Irish line.2[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675150] The Scottish Kennedys became apowerful strand of the aristocratic bloodlines of Scotland and married intoScottish royalty. One notable Kennedy was Archibald Kennedy, the 15th Earl ofCassillis, better known as the Marquess of Ailsa. He lived from 1872 to 1943 andheld many leading positions in the Grand Lodge of Scottish Freemasonry includingGrand Principle.3 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675239] He was a memberof the key Holyrood House Lodge no 44 in Edinburgh which has close ties with theBritish royal family.4 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675322] In the 18thcentury, a Matthew Kennedy from Ireland went to Paris to work with his goodfriend, the Illuminati frontman called Saint Germain, who presided over theIlluminati Lodge at Ermenonville near Paris.5[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675405] The lodge took part in bloodrituals on an altar made from human bones.6[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675488] This Kennedy produced a workcalled A Chronological, Genealogical and Historical Dissertation of the RoyalFamily of the Stuarts who connect into the Merovingian line established inFrance. The JFK wing is related to the Fitzpatricks, a powerful Irish familywith a coat of arms which includes the classic Brotherhood symbols of threefleur-de-lis, a dragon, and a lion.7[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675579] It seems likely that theFitzpatricks go back to France and the Holy Grail story.The family of JFK’s wife, Jackie Bouvier Kennedy (later Onassis), are related tothe Auchinclosses, one of the major Elite Scottish bloodlines, via the marriageof Jackie’s sister into the Auchincloss clan. Other Auchincloss bloodlines havemanifested as names like Bundy, Grosvenor, Vanderbilt, Winthrop andRockefeller.8 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1675668] Hugh D.

The marriage of John Kennedyto Jackie Bouvier was another arranged marriage by the Eastern Establishment,the American bloodlines who run the United States according to the Agendadecided in the British Isles and France. Both bloodlines connect with the keycentres of London and Paris. The fact that their marriage and presidency wasknown as ‘Camelot’ with its King Arthur and Mars connotations, is thoroughlyappropriate because the King Arthur symbolism is used by the Brotherhood as partof their secret language. The Kennedy family have been closely involved withdrugs, organised crime, the British monarchy, and the mind controlled slaveoperations like Project Monarch. This adds credibility to the claims by arecovered mind controlled slave I met who said she was taken to have sex withJohn F. Kennedy at the age of eleven – “Although they made me up to look about16”.The Kennedy presidency was certainly not the way it was portrayed at the time.Kennedy had a stream of sexual partners and three of them, Marilyn Monroe, JayneMansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor, were also girlfriends of Anton LaVey, head of theChurch of Satan. Jayne Mansfield was a high priestess. Other long termrelationships included two with members of Elite Scottish bloodlines, Lady JeanCampbell, daughter of the Duke of Argyll, and Kay-Kay Hannon Auchincloss12[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676038] of the family to which his wifewas related. Behind JFK’s rise to fame was his father, Joseph Kennedy, a memberof the Brotherhood’s Pilgrim Society. He was a crook with close connections tothe Mafia and other organised crime. His fortune was assured when WinstonChurchill awarded him the franchise to import British liquor into the UnitedStates. Joseph Kennedy was an associate of the Rothschilds and the Bronfmans,another ‘Jewish’ crime family in Canada which owns the liquor giant, Seagrams.Among Joseph Kennedy’s contacts in Britain when he was US Ambassador to theCourt of St James’s in London were the Astors and the Rothschild bloodlineoffshoot, the Sassoons. Another intimate friend was Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, aleading executive of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. JosephKennedy’s wife, Rose, came from the Black Nobility Fitzgerald family. TheFitzgeralds were one of the mighty Black Nobility clans of Italy which supportedWilliam the Conqueror’s conquest of England in 1066. This established BlackNobility rule of the British Isles via ancient families like the St.Clairs/Sinclairs. So the ‘F’ in JFK was a Black Nobility family going backthousands of years. Rose’s father and JFK’s grandfather was John F. (Honey Fitz)Fitzgerald, the vote-rigging mayor of Boston. The Fitzgeralds lived in HanoverStreet near the former site of the Green Dragon Tavern in Boston, home to the StAndrews Lodge which was heavily involved in the manipulation of the American Warof Independence and orchestrated the Boston Tea Party.13[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676170]Joseph Kennedy was a member of the Order of St John, the British version of theKnights of Malta, and the Bouvier family was intermarried with the Radziwillswho established the Knights of St John/Knights of Malta in Poland in 1610 andalso helped to establish the order in the United States.14[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676284] The Kennedys support the Knightsof Malta hospice movement in the United States via the Kennedy Institute for theStudy of Human Reproduction and Bioethics at the Jesuit-controlled GeorgetownUniversity. The hospice movement, while presented with a compassionate face, isa front to gather support for euthanasia. Most people involved with the hospicemovement are compassionate, it is the motivation of those who are manipulatingit that I am talking about. Once euthanasia is accepted in law, it opens thefloodgates for the legalised murder of what Kissinger calls the “uselesseaters”. As has been well documented in the countless biographies of JFK, heendured a loveless childhood under the iron rule of his father Joe and mother,Rose. He wasn’t even told that his brother Teddy had been born and it was onlywhen he came home from boarding school that he realised he had a new brother.There were no hugs, no show of affection, and the Kennedy children were notallowed to show pain. His upbringing has all the classic signs of the mindcontrol techniques the Elite use on their own children. Prince Charles wentthrough exactly the same upbringing under his aggressive and deeply unpleasantfather, Prince Philip. JFK was groomed from an early age to take high office forthe Brotherhood and he was supported by all the classic names like theRothschilds, Tafts, Russells, Rockefellers, and media barons like Henry Luce,the head of Time-Life, and Randolph Hearst, the most powerful newspaper tycoonin the United States. When Kennedy ran for political office, the Boston Americannewspaper, owned by Hearst, refused to accept the paid advertisements of hisopponent.15 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676409]But when JFK and his brother, Bobby, became President and Attorney General ofthe United States after their defeat of Richard Nixon in 1960, it seems thatthey began to pursue policies and people that were far from conducive to theintroduction of their paymasters agenda. This included withdrawal from theVietnam War, the introduction of some interest-free money, an assault onorganised crime (in public at least) and, as Kennedy put it, a pledge to breakup the CIA “Into a thousand pieces”. It doesn’t matter who you are, if you don’tdo as you are told, you are removed in the most appropriate way, bloodline ornot. The Agenda is far greater than any individual or family. I can’t helpthinking, however, that there was more to the assassination than this and it hasthe feel of a long planned sacrificial murder, in accordance with theBrotherhood’s ancient ritual laws. The location of the assassination, Dallas,Texas is close to the 33rd parallel of the 33rd degree of latitude. The toplevel of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is the 32nd degree and the 33rd degreeis only for those who have contributed significantly to the Great Work, thetakeover of Planet Earth. Dealey Plaza is a mass of esoteric symbolism and isofficially named after a 33rd degree Freemason called George Bannerman Dealey,an early executive of the Dallas Morning News. Dealey means ‘goddess line’. Leycan also mean rule or law in Spanish, so translating as ‘goddess-rule’. Eitheris perfect symbolism for the Brotherhood, especially the latter. Dealey Plaza,the site of the first Freemason temple in Dallas, is shaped like a pyramid withthe capstone missing (see Figure 51). The top is truncated by a railway bridge.The main pyramid is cut into two more by Main Street which runs directly throughthe centre. It is, in fact, three pyramids, two inside the one: the trinity ortriad. Two energies interacting produce a third. If anyone thinks this is merecoincidence they should do a little research into the background of theBrotherhood secret societies at the top levels and see the staggering obsessionthey have with their symbols and rituals. Kennedy was killed near the grassyknoll on the right of the pyramid. The old Court House nearby which looks intoDealey Plaza is decorated with gargoyles. On top of the Court House is thesymbol of the ancient Order of the Dragon or the Snake. Dealey Plaza, to thesecret societies, is a Sun temple.[../Images/00086.jpg]Figure 51: The pyramid with the capstone missing. This is Dealey Plaza whereJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated.Kennedy was assassinated in an outdoor temple of the Sun by initiates of theBrotherhood network including the Knights Templar, the Knights of Malta, theOrder of St John of Jerusalem, the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons. As JamesShelby Downard writes: “ Masonry does not believe in murdering a man in just anyold way and in the JFK assassination it went to incredible lengths and tookgreat risks in order to make this heinous act correspond to the ancientfertility oblation of the Killing of The King”.16[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676500] Kennedy was shot just after noonwhen the Sun was “most high”. In ancient times it was said that when the Sun was“most high”, he was doing his father’s work in the temple (more symbolism usedin the Jesus story). Bill Cooper, a former operative with US Naval Intelligence,believes that the mythical Freemason hero, Hiram Abiff, is really a symbol forJacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar when they were purgedin France in 1307. De Molay was burnt to death on the Ile de la Cite, theoriginal Paris, in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral, which the Templar’s hadbuilt on a former site of worship to the goddess Diana. His death was ordered bythe Roman Church Inquisition with support from King Phillipe the Fair, who couldwell have been under the control of the Priory of Sion. Cooper says that theassassination of JFK was the revenge of the Knights Templar against the Church,the state and the people. Kennedy is the only Roman Catholic President of theUnited States, the same Church of Rome which killed Jacques de Molay. On DealeyPlaza today, standing near the points where Kennedy and Oswald were murdered, isthe obelisk erected by the Freemasons after the murders. The obelisk is symbolicof the penis of Osiris in Egyptian legend and the one in Dealey Plaza has theflame or lighted torch at the top (see picture section). The eternal flame onthe Kennedy grave in Arlington Cemetery is there for the same reason. The flameor lighted torch is the most obvious Brotherhood signature and on Kennedy’sgrave the flame is within a circle, the ancient symbol of the Sun. Kennedy wasalso laid in state in the centre of a circle under the dome on Capitol Hill.There are 14 stones on the obelisk in Dealey Plaza, the number of pieces intowhich Osiris was cut by Set, according to Egyptian myth. The one part that hissister-wife, Isis, could not find was his penis, represented by the obeliskitself. She replaced the penis of Osiris with the golden one she made herselfand this became the symbol of the Brotherhood. The Dealey Plaza obelisk wasbuilt for, and dedicated to, a Freemasonic lodge of the Scottish Rite. They havefound stone phalluses in cathedrals and churches hidden inside altars and whenthe investigation team of New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison, searchedthe home of Clay Shaw they found penises.In this book I’ve exposed the secret language at its basic level, but the depthto which it goes is astonishing. The science of numbers and names is one ofthese deeper levels of communication and symbolism which only an advancedinitiate or focused researcher would fully understand. Numbers and names are,once again, vibrational frequencies and the amazing synchronicity of these isdue, I feel, to what I call the law of vibrational attraction. Many of thenumber-name ‘coincidences’ will be consciously made to happen, but others aresimply due to the energy field, the consciousness, of the person or peopleattracting to themselves vibrational fields which synchronise with the energythey are generating. This is how we create our own reality. Our inner self, ourvibrating consciousness field, attracts other ‘fields’ – people, places, ways oflife, experiences – which sync with the energy we are generating. It’s avibrational attraction between like energy fields. Therefore, our outer physicalexperience is merely a reflection of what is happening inside. What wevibrationally project with our attitudes and emotions, we attract back to us inpeople, places, ways of life and experiences which vibrate to the frequency weare projecting or broadcasting. So when we change what is happening within us,we change our physical experience because one is a reflection of the other. Itis this ‘magnetic’ attraction of like vibration to like vibration that leads topeople living in streets of a certain name or having relationships with those ofa certain name, etc., because everything has its own vibrational code, includingsounds, numbers, words, colours and names. In ritual magic the correct sounds,words, incantations, and colours, are all used to manifest a desired energyfield or vibratory field. Sound is especially important and this is why thePhoenicians were concerned more with the sound of their words than theirspelling. Mantras, the constant repeating of the same phrase or sound, are partof this same knowledge. And, like all knowledge, they can be used for good orill. The training of Japanese Samurai warriors included instruction in producingthe fighting cry, “Kiai”. This sound is supposed to cause a lowering of bloodpressure and partial paralysis in the hearer. Thus we have a ‘blood-chilling’cry. Low frequency sounds of three to five cycles a second can kill you. TheAmerican researcher, James Shelby Downard, has written of this science ofsounds, numbers and names in relation to the Kennedy assassination. The writer,Robert Anton Wilson, says in his book The Cosmic Trigger, that Downard’s theoryis “The most absurd, the most incredible, the most ridiculous Illuminati theoryof them all”. This makes me even more certain that Downard must definitely be onto something. My own research supports this, too.Kennedy was killed on November 22nd 1963. This date was the anniversary of theorder or papal bull by Pope Clement V for the Knights Templar to be subjected totorture by the Dominican Inquisition. It was issued on November 22nd 1307.November is also the 11th month and if you add that to 22, again you have 33.John and Jackie Kennedy left Fort Worth on the morning of November 22nd 1963 andthe plane came to a stop at gate 28 at Love Field Airport in Dallas. The number28 is assigned the name ‘Beale’ in Solomonic cabalistic numerology. Beale is aword which derives in this way: Bel (El), Baal, Be al, Beal, Beale. These allrelate to Sun gods. The 28th degree of the Knights Templar is the ‘King of theSun degree’. JFK was born at 83 Beal Street, Brookline, Massachusetts, on May29th 1917. The ‘protection’ of the President on this fatal trip to Dallas wasorganised by the New Orleans CIA station which was housed in a Masonic templebuilding. Dallas is just ten miles south of the 33rd degree of latitude and thefounding lodge of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry was in Charleston, exactly onthe 33rd degree. The first atom bomb was exploded at the ‘Trinity’ Site on the33rd degree of latitude. The Kennedy motorcade travelled down Elm Street oncehome to the Blue Front Tavern, the meeting place for Freemasons, and at 12.22 pmit arrived in Dealey Plaza. Elm Street was known as ‘Bloody’ Elm Street becauseit was the scene of countless gun fights, stabbings and other acts of violence.The national offices of Texaco Oil are on Elm Street. Close to Dealey Plaza isthe Trinity River which used to flood the Plaza for many years until theintroduction of flood defences. Into this open air temple of the ancientBrotherhood came Jackie Kennedy, representing the goddess, the Queen of Love andBeauty and her scapegoat Sun King, John F. Kennedy. He was the sacrifice in theancient ritual of the Killing of the Sun King: the ‘Ceannaideach’ which isGaelic for Wounded Head. Kennedy, of course, was shot in the head. One sourcesuggests that Kennedy didn’t die until the following spring. The source claimsthat the ‘Kennedy’ who appeared in the post mortem photographs was J. D.Tippett, the police officer and Kennedy look-alike who was supposed to have beenshot by Oswald with a gun that wasn’t working! I don’t know if this is correct,but it is one view.When JFK was 22, a sculpture was made of him as a winged angel and it waspresented to the Vatican where it was used as part of a panel in which the angelhovers over St Therese as she writes in a book.17[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676623] After the assassination, Kennedy’sbody was code-named ‘Angel’ and the same name was used for the plane, Air Force1, which flew his coffin back to Washington.18[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676713] Both Kennedy and Oswald wereburied in places related to ‘Arlington’. Kennedy at the Arlington NationalCemetery near Washington DC and Oswald at the Rosehill Cemetery, near Arlington,Texas. Arlington is a word related to Freemasonic sorcery and pertains tonecrophilia, a morbid attraction to corpses. Oswald is Os or Oz, the EgyptianSun god Osiris as in the Wizard of Oz. If you are looking at the synchronicityin the science of names and numbers, look at the astonishing coincidencesbetween the assassinations of JFK and Abraham Lincoln, who was also killed bythe Brotherhood. Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846 and Kennedy was electedto Congress in 1946. Lincoln was elected president in 1860 and Kennedy waselected president in 1960. Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was born in1839 and Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of Kennedy, was born in 1939.Their successors were both called Johnson. Andrew Johnson, who succeededLincoln, was born in 1808 and Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in1908. Lincoln’s secretary was called Kennedy and Kennedy’s secretary was calledLincoln. Both presidents were murdered on a Friday in the presence of theirwives and both were shot in the head.Kennedy’s vice-president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, had prior knowledge of theassassination and when he became president he immediately reversed all thepolicies on Vietnam, interest-free money, and the CIA which Kennedy wasimplementing. The Brotherhood Mother Goddess, Arizona Wilder, says she saw theshape-shifting Johnson at sacrifice rituals. Johnson’s middle name, Baines,comes from the related Scottish clans of Bain, Bayne, Beathy, Binnie, Beath andBeth. Freemasons from these clans claim the same ancestor.19[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676797] The term, Mac, means ‘son of’ andso the son of Bain becomes MacBain and the interconnected clan, Beth, becomesMacBeth, the Scottish king made world famous by the writings of ‘WilliamShakespeare’. Bain in French means bath and this is an origin of the Order ofthe Bath title awarded by the British monarch. Purification or absolution bathsare given to the Masonic ‘Knights of the Bath’ before they cause murder andmayhem on the Brotherhood’s behalf. After her husband’s death, Jackie Kennedyjourneyed to the island of Delos in the Aegean Sea which is considered by legendto be the birthplace of the goddess Diana and Apollo the Greek Sun god. Diana(the Moon) and Apollo (the Sun) are often brought together in Brotherhoodsymbolism. Delos is also known as the Island of the Dead because another versionof the goddess Diana, known as Hecate, is said to be the patroness of the‘infernal arts’. Jackie went on to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi in Greece andin the ruins of a Greek theatre on that site she performed an ancient rite knownas the Greeting of the Sun. She performed this, according to James ShelbyDownard, “With the expertise of an Aleister Crowley”.20[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676886] Another stop on her tour was theisland of Santorina with its reputation for vampires. The origin of the vampirestories are the blood drinking and blood sucking rituals of the reptilians andtheir ‘energy sucking’ rituals, also. The vampire stories put the truth beforeour eyes in a way that we think is only fiction. This is something theBrotherhood loves to do via its biggest vehicle for communication, Hollywood, aname which comes from the holly bush, the holly (holy) wood of the Druidmagicians. Hollywood is called a place of magic. Exactly what it is. It’splaying with our minds, manipulating illusions.There are so many similarities between the Kennedy assassination, the ritualkilling of a Sun King, and that of Diana, Princess of Wales, in what I amconvinced to have been a ritual murder of the Moon goddess known to the ancientsas Diana. It was planned that Kennedy would die on that spot at that time longbefore he became president and so, I believe, Diana was groomed for at leastmany years to die in Paris at that spot at that time, also. It is quite possiblethat this was planned from their childhood, even birth. I know how extreme thatsounds, but when you study the Brotherhood in depth you realise very quicklythat they are not formulating their plans weeks or months in advance, butliterally centuries. From the lower fourth dimension the reptilians have a verydifferent perspective of time in this dimension than we do. In the concludingchapters I will look in more detail at this and how and why such ritualassassinations are performed with such an eye to detail. Planning the murder ofthe Roman Catholic John Kennedy, the Sun King, to mark the anniversary of theRoman Church’s Inquisition against the Knights Templar (or some other ritual)could quite obviously have been agreed decades in advance and the scapegoatdecided and groomed for office. In the same way, Diana’s birth to the bloodlinefamily the Spencers in 1961 could have led to her being chosen as a symbol ofthe goddess Diana who would be led to a ritual death in an ancient sacred placeof Diana worship and sacrifice, the Pont de L’Alma tunnel in Paris. I thinkthere is an excellent chance that this is what happened. Just as Kennedy wasmanoeuvred into the presidency in 1960 for his ritual murder in 1963, so Dianawas manoeuvred and manipulated into a marriage with Prince Charles and, finally,into the Pont de L’Alma tunnel. People say that to arrange the murder of Dianawould have involved enormous planning and a great deal of time. Yes, that’sprobably right. But they had plenty of time.Diana Frances Spencer was born at Park House on the Queen’s Sandringham estatein Norfolk on July 1st 1961, the third and youngest daughter of ViscountAlthorp, later the 8th Earl Spencer, and his first wife Frances Roche. Herparents separated when she was six and divorced in 1969, and her mother marriedthe wallpaper tycoon Peter Shand-Kidd. Diana had a younger brother, Charles, thepresent Earl Spencer, and two sisters, Jane and Sarah. Another son was bornbefore Diana, but he died and she believed that her parents would much rathershe been a boy, a son and heir. Diana said that her childhood was very unhappyand she was to crave all her short life for the love and warmth denied her as achild. Living at Sandringham she knew the Queen from the time she was a littlegirl and she used to play with the royal children. It is said that Charles firstsaw Diana when she was still in her pram. She remembered, with less thanaffection, being shunted over to the Queen’s residence during the holidays yearafter year to watch the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The choice of movie isinteresting because it was written by Ian Fleming, the intelligence agent,friend of Aleister Crowley and author of the James Bond novels. The moviefeatures a king and queen who hate children. They employ a child catcher to lurechildren, abduct them, and put them in a cage. They are then taken to the castleand locked in a dungeon. It is all symbolism for what is actually happening andthere is no way that the Windsors played this for Diana so often by accident.Certainly Diana was already picking up the Windsor ‘vibes’ at Sandringham. Shetold Andrew Morton in his book, Diana: Her True Story: “The atmosphere wasalways very strange when we went there and I used to kick and fight anyone whotried to make us go”.21 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1676976] So theWindsors were well aware of Diana from the moment she was born. When she was 13,Diana moved from Norfolk to live at Althorp in Northamptonshire, the Spencerfamily’s ancestral home, after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer.Diana was particularly devastated when her father married Raine, the daughter ofthe novelist Barbara Cartland. Diana had a deep loathing for her. She said inDiana: Her True Story that in September 1989 she had unleashed her years offrustration on Raine: “I told her what I thought about her, and I’ve never knownsuch anger in me. I remember really going for her gullet”. I said “If you onlyknew how much we all hated you for what you’ve done, you’ve ruined the house(Althorp), you spend all daddy’s money, and for what?” The empathy that Dianahad with people in emotional distress came from her own emotional scars whichshe carried all her life.The Spencers are an Elite bloodline family. They are cousins of theSpencer-Churchills and related to the Marlborough family at Blenheim Palace inOxfordshire, where Winston Churchill was born. Other forebears included the Dukeof Marlborough, Sir Robert Walpole, and the Spencer family inherited aconsiderable fortune from Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. They also married intothe Cavendish family, the Dukes of Devonshire at Chatsworth House, and thatoffshoot became known as Spencer-Cavendish. Diana shared common ancestors withPrince Charles in the 3rd Duke of Devonshire and, most significantly, King JamesI, the first Stuart king of England and Scotland and sponsor of Francis Bacon.It was King James who played a highly influential role in the expansion of theBrotherhood, the formation of the Virginia Company which still controls theUnited States, and the creation of the King James version of the Bible. Dianawas also descended through several lines from the Stuart kings, Charles II andJames II, which connected her, as with James I, to the Merovingian bloodline inFrance. Charles II had so many children out of wedlock that goodness knows wheresome of their bloodlines are today. One thing’s for sure, the Brotherhood willknow. As Elite families go, the Spencers are an important bloodline and Dianawas related to countless aristocratic lines, including the Earls of Lucan.Further afield the Spencers have blood ties with many leading American familiesand they are related to the Rockefellers and the Roosevelts. They have a longhistory of serving the monarch and the tradition continued with Diana’s father.He was equerry to King George VI (who was married to the Queen Mother) and toQueen Elizabeth. Diana’s sister, Jane, is married to Sir Robert Fellowes, theQueen’s Private Secretary at the time of Diana’s death. Both of Diana’sgrandmothers, the Countess Spencer and Ruth Lady Fermoy, were inner circlemembers of the Queen Mother’s court, as were four of her great aunts. TheSpencers and the Queen Mother were very close and it was Lady Fermoy and theQueen Mother who manipulated Diana into her marriage with Prince Charles. Thiscould be most significant when you hear about the true nature of the QueenMother.The countdown to the marriage began when Diana met Prince Charles at Althorpwhile he was having a relationship with her sister Sarah, in 1977. Diana was 16,but it was three years later that the Windsors really made their move on her.With the Queen Mother and Lady Fermoy manipulating behind the scenes, she wasinvited to a dance at Buckingham Palace to celebrate Charles’ 30th birthday.Then, in July 1980, a friend of Charles, Philip de Pass, asked her to stay withthem while the Prince was there. In Diana’s own words, Charles was all over herand “He leapt on me practically”.22[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677204] He asked her to travel with him toBuckingham Palace the next day and an invitation followed to join the Windsorsin the September at Balmoral, their residence in Scotland. Eventually Charlesasked her to marry him and she accepted. “I love you so much” Diana said to him.“Whatever love is” Charles replied.23[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677288] That is such a telling statementabout the Windsors and the way they bring up their children. They don’tunderstand love because they give and receive so little. Imagine being a youngchild and having to line up with everyone else to shake your mother’s hand whenshe returned from an overseas visit. That is how the Queen and Prince Philiptreated Charles. Diana was a kindergarten nanny when the story of therelationship broke in the media and her life in the public eye and the constantspotlight had begun. So had her nightmare with the Windsors. Looking back, Dianacould see that Charles had never been genuine in his affection for her. Sherealised even before the wedding that he was having a relationship with his reallove, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and this continued and grew during their marriage.Charles and Camilla communicated using the code ‘Gladys and Fred’. Camilla, likethe Windsors, is close to the Rothschilds and on the first anniversary ofDiana’s death, she was on the Ionian island of Corfu enjoying the hospitality ofLord Jacob Rothschild.24 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677372] He hasalso spent £16 million leasing and restoring the Spencer’s 18th century mansionoverlooking Green Park in London, close to Buckingham Palace.25[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677508]The Windsors wanted Diana to produce heirs with Spencer genes and that was allshe was to them: an incubator. A week after her engagement to Charles, herbulimia began. This is an eating disorder in which you make yourself sick everytime you eat food. Diana was throwing up three or four times a day and becamedesperately thin. As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, many victims ofchildhood sexual and Satanic abuse suffer from bulimia later in life. She saidthat the bulimia was ‘triggered’ when Charles put his hand on her waist and said“Oh, a bit chubby here, aren’t we?” Bulimia is a disease of the emotions, asmost diseases are, and Diana was in emotional turmoil even before the wedding.She described the attitude of Charles like this:“He’d found the virgin, the sacrificial lamb, and in a way he was obsessed withme. But it was hot and cold, hot and cold. You never knew what mood it was goingto be, up and down, up and down… He was in awe of his mama, intimidated by hisfather, and I was always the third person in the room.”26[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677592]She met her sisters and told them she couldn’t go through with the marriage,especially with Camilla still on the scene, but they said she had no choicebecause “Your face is on the tea towels and you’re too late to chicken out”.Before the wedding, Diana stayed at Clarence House, the London residence of theQueen Mother. When she had arrived no-one was there to welcome her, she said, itwas like going to a hotel. Diana and Charles were married in St Paul’s Cathedralon July 29th 1981. That morning at Clarence House she said she felt calm,deathly calm: “I felt I was a lamb to the slaughter. I knew it, and I couldn’tdo anything about it”.27 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677700] Whatprophetic words those would prove to be. They spent the first night of theirhoneymoon at the Mountbatten family estate at Broadlands in Hampshire beforesailing around the Greek islands in the royal yacht Britannia (Barati). Thebulimia got worse and she considered suicide, such was the scale of herunhappiness. “My husband made me feel so inadequate in every possible way thateach time I came up for air he pushed me down again. I hated myself so much”.One of Diana’s royal duties in 1982 was to represent the Queen at the funeral ofPrincess Grace of Monaco, another victim of Brotherhood murder when the brakeson her car failed. Princess Grace, formerly the actress Grace Kelly, ran theMonaco branch of the Order of the Solar Temple with Jean Louis Marsan, the closefriend of her husband, Prince Rainier. The Windsors got what they wanted whenPrince William was conceived. Diana was told that the birth had to be induced tofit in with Charles’ polo playing programme and the blond-haired, blue-eyedWilliam was born on June 21st 1982, the summer solstice. Now first of all, whatkind of father and husband insists that his wife and son be given needless drugsto suit his polo diary? And secondly, does anyone believe that was really thereason? The Windsors are obsessed with astrology and the esoteric arts to suchan extent that the psychic-astrologer mother of an Irish friend of mine couldpredict with uncanny accuracy the colours the Queen and Queen Mother would bewearing every day. She was correct again and again because she knew the coloursconnected to each day according to esoteric law. A family so steeped inSatanism, the esoteric mysteries, and the Sun cult, induce the heir to ensure heis born on the summer solstice, when the Sun is at the peak of its power, andthat’s just a coincidence? No way. He was christened William (after the BlackNobility William the Conqueror) Arthur (after the Sun God symbol, King Arthur)Philip (after the Duke of Edinburgh) Louis (after Louis Mountbatten). William’sfirst serious girlfriend, according to the British press, was EmmaParker-Bowles, the niece of his father’s lover, Camilla. Prince Harry was bornin September 1984 and Diana’s usefulness to the Windsors was over. “Thensuddenly as Harry was born it just went bang, our marriage, the whole thing wentdown the drain”, she told Andrew Morton.28[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677784] Diana and Charles separated in1992 and divorced on August 28th 1996. Almost exactly a year later she was dead.Diana lived in apartments at Kensington Palace or ‘KP’ as she called it. PrinceMichael of Kent, the Grand Master of English Freemasonry, has his home there,also. The Brotherhood-Windsor machine attempted to destroy Diana’s credibilityand public esteem. A tape of an intimate telephone conversation between her andthe car dealer, James Gilbey, was released through the media in 1992. On thetape Diana said that Charles was a real torture. She told Gilbey: “I’ll go outand conquer the world, do my bit in the way I know how and leave him behind”.But despite, perhaps because of, the efforts to discredit her, Diana’spopularity continued and grew. Her unique combination of a big heart, a globalpublic profile, and an intense desire to settle a score with the Windsors,threatened the very survival of royalty. Her natural compassion and empathy withpeople were putting the emotionless Windsors in the shade and exposing them asout of date and irrelevant. The naive, shy 19-year-old, who was enticed into theWindsor web, was now a woman who was realising her true power and was preparedto use it. She took the issue of landmines from obscurity to the front pagesacross the world and she had the platform to do that with any subject she chose.To the Windsors and the Brotherhood, this lady was dangerous with a capital D.She also knew many intimate secrets of the Windsors and the establishment. Sheknew where the bodies were buried as they say, and she had shown in her famousinterview with the BBC current affairs programme, Panorama, in November 1995,that she was prepared to reveal some of them. That interview, in which shetalked of her unhappy relationship with the royal family in very forthrightterms, did immense harm to the Windsors and they must have wondered what onearth she would do next. In my travels around the world I met a man who had acall from Diana in March 1997, a few months before she died. He was amazed whenshe said it was the Princess of Wales and he didn’t believe her at first,especially when she said that she was calling from a ‘supermarket phone’ inEngland. But Diana and this man had a mutual friend, and a close confidant ofDiana told me that she often rang people from public phones, particularly from adepartment store in Kensingston, when she wanted to be certain the conversationwould not be tapped. Diana admired this man for his wisdom and knowledge. Shesaid she had something to reveal that would shake the world and she wanted hisadvice on how best to do it. He will not reveal what she told him, but when Isaid that I knew she was aware of the Windsors’ connection to global drugstrafficking, he said: “Oh no, it was much worse than that”. You might get anidea of what it could have been later in this chapter. Diana knew far more thanpeople realise, as we shall also see. But that was only one level of the plot tokill Diana. At the highest level of the black magicians who control theBrotherhood networks, I have no doubt that her death had long been plannedaccording to their ancient and deeply sick ritual. These two levels, thepractical need to remove her (lower initiates) and the need for a ritual killingof the ‘goddess Diana’ (highest initiates) would run side by side, exactly asthey did with President Kennedy.The final sequence of events which led to her death involves, at almost everyturn, a man called Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian ‘owner’ of Harrods, the toppeople’s store in Knightsbridge, London, and the father of Dodi Fayed who diedin the crash with Diana. Al Fayed also owns the Ritz Hotel in Paris. This is theguy who bleats on and on about the need for “truth” and “justice” over the deathof Diana and yet he would not recognise truth if it bit him on the bum. You canalways tell when Mohamed Al Fayed is lying – his lips are moving. He fought along, public, and vicious battle for control of Harrods and the House of Fraserwith Tiny Rowland, the head of another Brotherhood front, Lonrho, theLondon-Rhodesia company, which has been responsible for so much manipulation ofAfrica and Africans. At one stage there was a Department of Trade and Industryinquiry into the Harrods takeover and it concluded: “The lies of Mohamed Fayedand his success in ‘gagging’ the press created a new fact: that lies were thetruth and the truth was a lie”.29 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1677868]This would be a suitable epitaph for what Private Eye, the British satiricalmagazine and others, have dubbed: The phony pharaoh. The report also revealedthat Al Fayed had lied about his family background. He had claimed to come froma wealthy Egyptian family and it was this money, he said, that he was using tobuy Harrods. In fact he comes from a far from rich family and he didn’t have anysuch money of his own. He was born on January 27th 1929 in Alexandria, the sonof a school inspector. He sold Coca-Cola in the streets and later knocked ondoors selling Singer sewing machines. It was an introduction to Adnan Khashoggi,now the world’s most famous arms broker, which changed his life. Khashoggi wasthe son of the personal physician to the King of Saudi Arabia and the Khashoggisemployed ‘Al’ Fayed (then Mohamed Abdel Moneim Fayed) in their businessventures. He later fell out with the Khashoggi family, apparently, and proceededto lie his way through a stream of business deals which made him a lot of moneyfrom setting up deals for others and taking a commission. The constructioncompany, Costain, was one of his main sources of income in the early days, buthe made nothing like as much money as he claimed to be worth. See Tom Bower’sbook, Fayed, The Unathorised Biography, for the detailed background.30[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678013] Al Fayed’s involvement with theHaiti dictator, Papa Doc, led to interest in his activities by the CIA. One CIAreport on him remarked that: “He strikes one as being friendly and evil at thesame time”.31 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678170]While he became wealthy by the standards of the rest of the population, he didnot have nearly enough of his own money to buy Harrods and he used the wealth ofthe Sultan of Brunei, one of the richest men in the world. It was the Sultan whoprovided the money for Harrods and Al Fayed also acted for him in the purchaseof the prestigious London hotels, the Savoy and the Dorchester. Al Fayed may actthe big tycoon, but in the biggest game he is a ‘gofer’ who takes orders anddoes as he’s told. This is fascinating because we are led to believe thatMohamed Al Fayed and the Queen are on different sides and oppose each other overwhat happened to Diana. Funny, then, that Mohamed Al Fayed is subordinate to theSultan of Brunei and the Queen of England is a friend of the Sultan of Brunei.She went to stay with him between September 16th and 20th in 1998.32[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678260] What is going on here? Al Fayed’smost prominent sycophantic media poodle is the Daily Mirror which has acted ashis personal newsletter. The Mirror made strenuous efforts to secure aninterview with me in June 1998, despite my initial reluctance. But when I mademy thoughts about Al Fayed known to the reporter, the article was dropped by theEditor, Piers Morgan, who personally conducts the Mirror interviews with AlFayed.Doing as you are told by the very rich and powerful and using highlyunscrupulous business methods, has proved extremely profitable for Al Fayed. Heowns a fleet of bullet proof Mercedes, a £3.5 million Sikorski helicopter, a £13million Gulfstream Jet, a £15 million yacht, The Jonikal, castles and 50,000acres in Scotland, and expensive homes in Gstaad, New York, Dubai, Geneva,Gerona, London, Surrey and Los Angeles, all fully staffed and equipped.33[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678392] Balnagown, his Scottish castle, isclose to Loch Ness. As long as he does as he is told and is useful to theBrotherhood his wealth will continue. If he doesn’t – gone. They will hang himout to dry. Another source of income for the Fayeds, again interconnected withthe Sultan of Brunei, is arms dealing. Al Fayed’s former brother-in-law andDodi’s uncle, Adnan Khashoggi, the infamous Saudi arms dealer and fixer, hasarranged weapons sales, legal and illegal, worth multibillions of dollars. Manyof the discussions for such deals take place at the Ritz Hotel in Paris owned byMohamed Al Fayed (or the Sultan?). This is one reason why Al Fayed has the Ritzbugged to eavesdrop on his VIP guests. In fact, he has everything bugged, aswe’ll see. He is deeply involved in brokering arms sales and Dodi was often anunofficial broker for arms-for-oil deals between the Gulf states and America.34[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678566] Adnan Khashoggi is a closeassociate of George Bush and bankrolled part of Bush’s ‘Iran-Contra’arms-fordrugs operation in the 1980s. George Bush, in turn, is a bosom buddy ofthe Queen and Prince Philip. Al Fayed is involved in many underground deals andplots involving events, people, and subjects that he is desperate to ensureremain secret. Certainly not a man to trust under any circumstances, in my view.I should emphasise, too, that the Islamic élite, like the Sultan of Brunei, aresignificant players in the Brotherhood pyramid and the Grand Lodge at Cairo isone of the most powerful secret society centres in the world. This is hardlysurprising given the Brotherhood’s obsession with ancient Egypt and it’s ritualand symbols. The reptilian bloodlines may be predominantly ‘Aryan’, but they arefar from exclusively so. They work through streams within all races, the Arabsand the ‘Jews’ most certainly among them. One of the predominant secretsocieties in the Arab world is the Order of the Mystic Shrine or the ‘Shriners’.They are connected to the Knights Templar, and the York and Scottish Rites ofFreemasonry. Among their members in the United States have been PresidentFranklin Delano Roosevelt and his successor President Harry S. Trueman. There isalso a Prince Hall Shrine for black members of the Brotherhood, including thatself-styled spokesman for the black community in the United States, JesseJackson.Al Fayed has served the interests of the Brotherhood and the establishment in anumber of ways while presenting an anti-establishment public profile. Forinstance it was he who exposed the two Conservative MPs, Neil Hamilton and TimSmith, who were taking money to ask certain questions in the House of Commons.This is quite illegal. Al Fayed knew that this was true because he was the onegiving them the money! This story did enormous harm to the ConservativeGovernment and did much to help the Brotherhood chosen one, Tony Blair, to alandslide victory for the Labour Party at the following General Election. AlFayed has also escaped prosecution so far for a growing number of allegationsfrom young female members of staff at Harrods that he sexually assaulted them.His obsession with sex is legendary. One girl, 17-year-old Samantha-Jane Ramsay,said that when she complained to her supervisor that she had been groped by AlFayed, the supervisor sighed: “Another one”. Al Fayed sacked her for making thecomplaint, as he does all those who speak out against his sexual molestation andstyle of business ‘management’. John Monks the general secretary of the TradesUnion Congress, said that at Harrods there was “A regime of fear and terror”.When Samantha-Jane took her complaint to the local Marylebone Police Station,she said that the officer told her: “You’re not the first to come to us. We havefiles inches high on Mr Al Fayed, but no proof. It would be your word againsthis”.35 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678656] A file inches high ofdifferent girls making the same complaint about the same man would, I suggest,constitute rather more than “No proof”. But Al Fayed, the man we are told theestablishment would love to crush, survives untouched. So this is just some ofthe background to the liar, double-dealer, sexual molester, Satanist and Sultanof Brunei frontman, who had complete control of Diana’s security in the days andhours leading up to her death. I wouldn’t trust him with the security of my cat.Indeed, as Tom Bower has documented, Al Fayed has ordered his hit men to shoot acat he didn’t like.Al Fayed had become close to the Spencer family through Diana’s father, Earl‘Johnny’ Spencer, and stepmother Raine. He helped ‘Johnny’ through financialdifficulties and said he considered the Earl to be a brother.36[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678802] He had given Raine, whom Dianacouldn’t stand, a place on the Harrods board. Al Fayed sponsored prestigiousroyal events like the Royal Windsor Horse Show and polo competitions, but heespecially backed the causes and charities supported by Diana. Bob Loftus, thehead of security at Harrods between 1987 and 1996, told the British Channel Fourprogramme, Dispatches, in June 1998, that he was ordered to tell Al Fayedimmediately if Diana came into the store. Al Fayed would then go to thedepartment where she was shopping and ‘accidentally’ meet her. Every Christmas agreen Harrods van would call at Diana’s home, Kensington Palace, with gifts forher and the boys from ‘Uncle Mohamed’. When you look at the evidence, he made ithis business to court the friendship of the Princess of Wales in every waypossible. On June 3rd 1997, he invited her to join him for a Summer holiday athis beach-side villa in San Tropez in the south of France. On June 11th he gotthe breakthrough he had been working so hard for: she accepted. The followingday he completed the purchase of a £15 million yacht, The Jonikal, through hisBermudan company Mohafa Shipping, and it was on this boat that Dodi and Diana’sromance was soon to blossom.On July 11th Diana arrived in San Tropez with her sons, William and Harry, tostay in an eight-bedroomed luxury apartment on the ten acre Al Fayed estate onthe exclusive Le Parc development. At this time, Dodi Fayed was still at hisapartment in Paris with his fiancée Kelly Fisher, the American model. The41-year-old Dodi was a ‘gofer’ for his father and lived on his father’s wealth,although he had enjoyed some success in the movie industry at one time as thehands-off producer of the hit British film Chariots Of Fire, again thanks to hisfather’s money. He had a playboy reputation and was a very big spender, oncefamously running up a $100,000 bill in two months on his Amex card. He wasdominated by his father and even in his film operation every decision had to beapproved by Al Fayed. Dodi did whatever his father told him to do. He had beenengaged to Kelly Fisher for eight months and she was expecting to spend herholiday on The Jonikal. But on the evening of July 14th, Dodi took a phone callfrom his father who ordered him to go immediately to San Tropez to be withDiana. Kelly Fisher described what happened next in an interview with theDispatches programme:“ (Dodi) said he was going to London and he’d be back and then we were going toSan Tropez. That evening he didn’t call me and I finally got him on his portablephone. I said ‘Dodi where are you?’ and he said he was in London. I said ‘OK,I’ll call you right back at your apartment’. He said ‘No, no, don’t call meback.’ So I said ‘Dodi where are you?’ and he admitted he was in the South ofFrance. His father had asked him to come down and not bring me, I know now.”Two days later Dodi sent a private plane to fly Kelly to San Tropez. But whilehe stayed with Diana, Kelly was kept aboard another Fayed boat. “I’m sittinghere stuck” she said. “So he had me in my little boat cage and he was, I knownow, seducing Diana.” On July 31st, Diana returned to San Tropez for a secondholiday with Dodi, this time alone. Kelly Fisher was back in Los Angelespreparing for her wedding to Dodi which she said was due to take place on August9th. But two days before that, the story broke in the world media of the romancebetween Dodi and Diana. Kelly heard from a friend who saw a picture in thepaper. She recalls:“I started calling him in London because at this time I was expecting hisarrival in a day. I called his private line, but there was no answer. So then Icalled the secretary and asked to speak to him and she wouldn’t put me on. SoMohamed got on and in so many horrible words told me to never call back again. Isaid ‘He’s my fiancee, what are you talking about?’ He hung up on me and Icalled back and the secretary said don’t ever call here again, your calls are nolonger to be put through. It was so horrible.”37[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1678943]Ironically, Diana used to have Kensington Palace swept for listening devices andnow she was in the clutches of a man for whom bugging was an obsession. The AlFayed villa in San Tropez was bugged, as were all Fayed properties. EverythingDiana said could be heard. Bob Loftus, the former Head of Security at Harrods,said that the bugging there was “A very extensive operation” and was also alwaysunder the direction of Al Fayed.38 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679065]Henry Porter, the London Editor of the magazine Vanity Fair, had spent two yearsinvestigating Al Fayed and he said they came across his almost obsessive use ofeavesdropping devices to tape telephone calls, bug rooms, and film people.Through mutual friends, Porter warned Diana about Al Fayed’s background andactivities “Because we thought this was quite dangerous for her for obviousreasons”.39 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679149] But Diana apparentlyfelt she could handle it and although she knew Al Fayed could “Sometimes be arogue”, he was no threat to her, she thought. He is rather more than a rogue andrather more often than ‘sometimes’. She apparently told friends: “I know he’snaughty, but that’s all”. The Dispatches programme said they had writtenevidence that Al Fayed bugged the Ritz Hotel and given his background and thedeals that are hatched at the Ritz, it would be staggering if he did not. KellyFisher said that the whole time she was in Fayed property she just assumedeverything was bugged. It was known, she said, and Dodi had told her everywherewas bugged. She went on: “As a matter of fact, when I confronted him aboutDiana, he said: ‘I can’t talk to you on the phone’. He said ‘I’ll talk to you inLA’. I knew what that meant”. Diana was under the ‘protection’ of the Al Fayedsecurity machine and even her most private conversations were being monitored.Diana went with Dodi to Al Fayed’s Elizabethan-style mansion called Barrow GreenCourt at Oxted in Surrey, formerly owned by the Satanist Lord McAlpine.Throughout the house Al Fayed had placed statues of semi-naked Greek goddesses.On August 21st, despite Henry Porter’s warning, Diana returned again to SanTropez for another holiday with Dodi. Al Fayed was milking the situation,briefing journalists and photographers and enlisting the advice of publicist MaxClifford.40 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679233] The Al Fayed machinewas leaking the couple’s whereabouts to ensure maximum publicity. Al Fayedcomplained after the crash that photographers and journalists would not leavethe Princess alone, a statement which, in the circumstances, beggars belief. TheDiana-Dodi romance was now in full swing and Al Fayed was urging his son tointensify the relationship.41 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679360] Andwhat Al Fayed said, Dodi did. Nothing was left to chance. Diana’s favouritemusic, the theme from The English Patient, was played over and over as thecouple cruised on The Jonikal. Diana and Dodi had much in common. Both had beenborn into wealthy families and their fathers were distant figures. Both hadexperienced the breakdown of their parents’ marriages as their mothers lefthome. They even attended finishing schools close to each other in Switzerland.But we should not rule out the possibility of mind manipulation techniques beingused on both parties. I have met a number of former mind controlled slaves whowere programmed to fall madly in love with someone they normally would not evenlike and there are endless examples of ‘love spells’ concocted by blackmagicians to cause someone to fall madly in love with them. My scientist friend,Brian Desborough, tells me that the feeling of being in love is dependent uponthe brain producing phenylethylamine. This is a chemical which also diminishesthe ability to discriminate effectively, hence the term ‘love is blind’.Production of this chemical is sustained by the release of endorphins, anaturally occurring chemical linked to memory, learning, pain suppression, sexdrive and hormone regulation. If these chemicals could be stimulated in bothparties they would fall instantly in love.I think there is a very good chance that something like this happened as thesting was set up for both of them. There was talk of engagement in the air, butit is impossible to say how imminent that was, because reports conflict. I havegreat doubts about that myself. Diana and Dodi left the South of France fromOlbia Airport at 1.30pm on August 30th bound for Paris on Al Fayed’s Gulfstreamjet. They apparently intended to stay one night at Dodi’s apartment, which looksout on the Arc de Triomphe, before going on to London where Diana was due tomeet her sons. It was to be her last full day alive. The plane touched down atLe Bourget Airport in Paris at 3.20pm and they were met by 20 or so celebrityphotographers known as the paparazzi (from an Italian word meaning ‘buzzinginsects’). A Mercedes was waiting for the party and a green Range Rover was tofollow on behind. This is normal security procedure and the very minimum youwould expect to protect someone so globally famous. With Diana and Dodi in theMercedes was Dodi’s bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, the 29-year-old former memberof the élite British military regiment, the Paras or Parachute Regiment. Alongwith the SAS, the Paras are the most highly trained (and therefore mindcontrolled) regiment in the British forces. In the Range Rover were the driver,Henri Paul, the acting Head of Security at the Ritz, and another bodyguard, KesWingfield. They drove from the airport to the Villa Windsor on the Bois deBoulogne, the former home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The Duke andDuchess lived there after the duke, as King Edward VIII, abdicated the Britishthrone when the government and establishment would not accept his marriage tothe America divorcee, Wallis Simpson. They then moved to Paris as the Duke andDuchess of Windsor. Their house is now owned by Mohamed Al Fayed and it is saidthat he was going to give it to Dodi and Diana as a wedding present. This talkof a wedding, however, is unsubstantiated, much as Al Fayed has sought topromote it. His publicity machine led the public to believe the couple had spenttime at Villa Windsor discussing decor, but the bodyguard Kes Wingfield saidthat they only stayed there for “Around ten minutes”.42[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679451] From here they were driven to theRitz Hotel where they arrived at 4.20pm.The Ritz is in the Place Vendome and all around that square at first floor levelare symbols of the Sun and the cross, very much like the symbols used by theancients to symbolise the ‘journey’ of the Sun through the year which I featuredearlier in the book. This was the symbol of King Louis XIV, who was known as the‘Sun King’. At his palace at Versailles in the 17th century he decorated roomsin honour of Apollo, the Sun god, and Diana, the goddess of the Moon. There wasalso a statue of the goddess Diana at Versailles. In the centre of the VendomeSquare is an immense pillar with a statue of Napoleon on the top and it mirrorsthe famous Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London. At this stage Dianastill had the same level of security that she’d had since the airport, but thiscould have been increased considerably if support from the French HighProtection Police Security Service (SPHP) had been requested. It is there toprotect VIPs visiting the city, but a request for their services must be made.It wasn’t. All Diana’s security was provided by Al Fayed’s people from start tofinish. If they had enlisted the protection of the French police, Diana wouldstill be alive. When a celebrity like Madonna visits Paris, the French Policehave one car in front of hers and another behind, together with two motorcycleriders front and back of the motorcade. The cars are driven by trained driversand they carry armed security men. According to reports, the SPHP made three,possibly four, offers to protect Diana, but each one was refused by Dodi. Washe, himself, under instruction to reject these offers from someone to whom hecould not say no? An officer of the SPHP told Dodi: “If you will not use ourcar, we recommend that two police cars accompany you on your excursions aroundthe city.”43 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679542] This advice, too, wasignored.[../Images/00090.jpg]Figure 52: The journey to Dodi’s apartment in the early evening of August 30th.A straightforward journey with no need to go through the Pont de L’Alma tunnel.Diana and Dodi went straight to the $6,000 a night 18th century Imperial Suiteat the Ritz. From there, Diana rang her friend, the Daily Mail journalistRichard Kay. She told him she intended to retire from public life in Novemberand he said that he had never heard her so happy. The couple booked a table atthe Chez Benoit restaurant for 8.45pm and they intended to spend the night atDodi’s apartment. At 6.30pm Dodi went across the Place Vendome to a jewellers,Repossi, to buy a diamond ring for Diana which was later delivered to the Ritz.A little after 7 pm, the couple were driven in the Mercedes along the ChampsElysées to Dodi’s apartment on Rue Arsene-Houssaye close to the Arc de Triomphe.Here they unpacked and prepared for dinner. Again the back up Range Rover wasthere and so was another car carrying bodyguards for added protection. Why wasthis level of security thought necessary in the early evening, but not in theearly hours of the morning at the time of the crash? Dodi’s apartment is knownas the ‘Etoile flat’ after the Place de L’Etoile, the ‘Sun or star circle’ roadaround the Arc de Triomphe. The route they took to the apartment was out of thePlace Vendome onto the Rue de Rivoli, and half way around the Place de laConcorde they turned right onto the Champs Elysées and drove straight up thatfamous avenue to Dodi’s apartment (see Figure 52). Remember that route, it iscrucially important. As they arrived at the apartment at 7.15pm, bodyguards wereseen to rush from their car to hold back six paparazzi. Diana and Dodi becameconcerned about eating at the unprotected Chez Benoit restaurant and decided tohead back to the Ritz to eat. They took the same route back, down the ChampsElysées and around the Place de la Concorde. The couple, with bodyguardsWingfield and Rees-Jones, walked into the Ritz, captured by the now famous videopictures, at 9.47pm. As the paparazzi gather in numbers outside, amid rumours ofan engagement announcement, Diana has already started the last three hours ofher life. Who was feeding the rumours and the whereabouts of Diana during theday to create the paparazzi stampede that dominated Diana and Dodi’s movementsand decisions that night? I think I can guess, somehow. Al Fayed. And who weresome of these ‘paparazzi’ making life uncomfortable for Diana, thus changing theplans for the evening? The Ritz security video also identified a number ofpeople who had been outside among the onlookers for most of the day and werestill there on the edge of the crowd.44[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679683]Now the plot seriously thickens. After speaking on the phone with his father athis estate in Oxted, Surrey, Dodi Fayed announced a quite ludicrous plan. Toavoid the paparazzi, the Mercedes which had been transporting them all daytogether with the back up Range Rover were to be taken around the front of thehotel and used as a decoy for the paparazzi. At the same time another Mercedeswould be brought around to the back entrance of the hotel to whisk the coupleaway to the apartment on the Champs Elysées. Henri Paul, the 41-year-old actinghead of security at the Ritz, was called on his mobile phone by Dodi and told toreport back to the hotel. He went off duty at 7pm and by the time he returned itwas 10pm. No-one has established where Paul was in those three hours. Dodi saidthat his father, Mohamed Al Fayed, had personally authorised that Henri Paulshould drive the Mercedes. For me, that is Dodi-speak for “My father told methis is how it is going to be”. Henri Paul was not a qualified chauffeur and hadno hire car permit. L. Fletcher Prouty, a former colonel in the US Airforce whoworked closely with the intelligence agencies, once said:“No-one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The active role is playedsecretly by permitting it to happen. This is the greatest single clue. Who hasthe power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions?”45[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679778]Absolutely right. If we apply Prouty’s rule to Diana and ask who had the power –and used that power – to reduce the usual security precautions for her thatnight, we have a rather interesting answer: Mohamed Al Fayed. Given thesecircumstances he must answer the obvious question: Why was this securityreduced? When President Kennedy was assassinated, there were no bodyguardsstanding on his car while four were standing on the one immediately behind (seepicture section). He was also in an open-topped car at a dangerous time in adangerous city. When Martin Luther King was shot dead at the Lorraine Motel inMemphis, Tennessee, on April 4th, 1968, the black police officer in charge ofsecurity for King was sent home against his will hours before the shooting. Theonly two black firemen at the station next to the motel were sent to otherstations just for that day. The scapegoat for this assassination was a guycalled James Earl Ray. Not even King’s family believed he was responsible. Somuch so that they attended his funeral a few years ago. King, by the way, wasvery different from his public image, as was JFK. When Bobby Kennedy wasmurdered after making a speech at the Ambassadors Hotel in Los Angeles on June4th 1968, again the security arrangements were tampered with. The plan was forKennedy to walk off the stage and through the crowd to the exit. But immediatelyafter the speech, Kennedy’s ‘aides’, especially Frank Mankiewicz, insisted thatit was safer for him to go out through the hotel kitchen. When he walked intothe kitchen he was met by the mind controlled Sirhan Sirhan with a gun in hishand. It is far more likely that Bobby Kennedy was actually shot by members ofhis ‘security’ team, particularly Thane Eugene Caesar, the ‘security guard’ whowas employed at the last minute and had endless connections into far rightgroups and the intelligence community. But with Sirhan Sirhan at the scene witha gun, they had a mind controlled scapegoat to take the rap and that was allthey needed. Sirhan Sirhan had been on a ‘mind expansion’ course with theRosicrucians in the weeks before he was implicated in Kennedy’s death (see …AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free). Frank Mankiewicz, who guided Kennedy to thekitchen, was a former public relations man for the Mossad-front in America, theAnti Defamation League. He turned up later as head of publicity for the OliverStone film, JFK, which claimed to be an exposé of the assassination of PresidentKennedy. It wasn’t. When the Israeli Prime Minister, Zitzhak Rabin, was shotdead by an assassin in Tel Aviv in 1995, an extraordinary video taken by anonlooker showed how Rabin’s security detail stepped back in unison to leave theassassin alone and free to kill his target. You can see the pattern. And whathappened in the crucial last minutes of Diana’s life? They withdrew her securityon the orders of Mohamed Al Fayed via his son. That is a fact. All day she hadtravelled in the same Mercedes with the Range Rover as a back up vehicle. Nowshe would transfer to another Mercedes with no back up support whatsoever. Thiswas an extraordinary decision for a man obsessed with his own security. BobLoftus, the former Head of Security at Harrods, said:“Compared with the protection that Al Fayed affords himself, which is veryprofessional, of a very high standard, that which was afforded to the mother ofthe future King of England was a Mickey Mouse operation.”46[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1679967]He added that “Al Fayed was absolutely paranoid about his personal protection”.Just for him to walk around his own store, there would be three or four plainclothes members of his personal protection team who travelled with him all thetime, plus another four uniformed security who would act almost as ‘outriders’to create two rings of security around him. That’s in his own store! But is itparanoia, or the knowledge of the seedy, cesspit, world of arms dealers andBrotherhood fixers of many kinds, in which Al Fayed constantly operates? Peoplewho think nothing of the mass murder of children, let alone the assassination ofa wealthy ‘yes’ man like him. Dodi Fayed was obsessed with his security for thesame reason. A lot of this security was also inspired by the size of Al Fayed’sego, to be fair. Mostly he recruited his body guards from the SAS and theParachute Regiment and used the Brotherhood operation, Control Risks, to makerecommendations. Tom Bower tells in his book about Al Fayed of how armed guardsat the Oxted estate hide behind bushes wearing full combat uniform and blackedout faces. Whenever Al Fayed travelled in his Mercedes there was always a backup Range Rover carrying emergency medical equipment and security staff, but nowhe withdrew that protection from Diana. More than that, a new car was introducedfor her, another Mercedes was sent to the rear entrance of the Ritz, supplied bya car hire company called Etoile Limousines, the same name as Dodi’s flat.Etoile Limousines is based at the Ritz and depends for its entire income oncontracts with the hotel and its guests. In other words, it is controlledcompletely by Mohamed Al Fayed and whoever controls him. The new Mercedes was anS-280, lighter in weight than the 600 series they had used all day and withoutthe dark tinted windows. Other cars were available, but this one was choseninstead. A director of Etoile, Niels Siegel, told the inquiry into Diana’s deaththat he delivered the car to the rear entrance of the Ritz, but the Dispatchesprogramme showed that this is a lie. It was delivered by a driver calledFrederic Lucard and he can be seen doing so on the security video. Lucard saidhe found it very strange that Etoile would allow Henri Paul, a man not qualifiedas a chauffeur, to drive one of their cars. So why did they do it? BecauseMohamed Al Fayed told them to, that’s why. Brian Dodd, the former Head ofSecurity for Al Fayed in the 1980s, gave his assessment of the situation toDispatches:“It’s a new car that’s come into the system. They wouldn’t have had time tocheck that car out. It should have been checked out. There could have been abomb on the car, for instance. It was a most stupid plan. It shouldn’t even havebeen considered. The back up vehicle is there, not just to avert the paparazzi,but for instance, a motor cyclist with a pillion rider to pull up and shoot, orput a magnetised bomb on top of the car. That’s why the back up car is there –to stop any of that. Why they never had a back up car, God only knows. (I thinkI can offer a good guess without the need for Divine inspiration.)“I had probably six or eight men I would consider professional bodyguards who Iwould have had on that job and Trevor Rees-Jones and Kes Wingfield, after what Ihave seen happened, would not have been in Paris that night.”The Mercedes with Henry Paul at the wheel sped off from the rear entrance of theRitz at 12.20am with Paul telling the paparazzi not to bother following becausethey would never catch him. Diana and Dodi were in the back seat and in thefront was Trevor Rees-Jones, the former ‘Para’ with the reputation for being‘fearless’. Rees-Jones says he disagreed with the change of plan. He was notwearing a seat belt which is normal practice in built-up areas because bodyguards need to be free to react quickly. The car was driven at speed down theRue Cambon and turned right down the Rue de Rivoli into the Place de la Concordewhere it stopped briefly at the lights. The paparazzi photographer, Romuald Rat,on the back of a motor cycle, drew up alongside them here, but he says thatHenri Paul jumped the lights on red and headed onto the dual carriagewayalongside the River Seine called the Cours la Reine. The car plunged down intoone tunnel, came back to the surface, and almost immediately went down into thevery short tunnel at the Pont de L’Alma. Here it went out of control and struckthe 13th pillar in the centre of the tunnel which is lined with concrete pillarsunprotected by crash barriers. Henri Paul and Dodi Fayed died immediately.According to the autopsy report Diana was clinically dead within 20 minutes andthis was long before she arrived at hospital. Trevor Rees-Jones survived thecrash because he was wearing a seat belt and Diana and Dodi were not. This couldbe highly significant. Rees-Jones was not wearing a belt when they left the Ritzin accordance with normal practice for body guards, and when Romuald Rat took aphotograph at the lights at the Place de la Concorde, Rees-Jones still did nothave a seat belt on. But little more than a minute later when the car struck thepillar, he was wearing a seat belt. Why? If he donned the belt because for somereason he sensed danger, why did he not scream at Diana and Dodi to put theirseat belts on? After all it only takes a second and the whole reason he was inthe car was to protect them. Rees-Jones has some serious questions to answerhere and he is giving no answers. Some bodyguards do put a seat belt on when thecar is on a fast road, but Rees-Jones is not saying this. He says he doesn’tknow why he strapped himself in. And if they were going to Dodi’s flat, theywould have been on the fast road for about a minute. All he says is that heremembers they were followed by two cars, one of them white, and a motorcycle,which is in keeping with the smokescreen story. But one simple fact about thecrash has been missed by all the newspaper articles, magazine features,television documentaries and discussions I have seen, and by all but a fewresearchers. Everyone is agreed that the couple were being driven back to Dodi’sflat near the Arc de Triomphe when the crash happened. Well there is one glaringproblem with that:The Pont de L’Alma tunnel is not on the way to Dodi’s flat.It takes you away from that area.I have been to Paris and walked the route the car took that night, in fact Ihave walked extensively around that whole area, and the route to Dodi’sapartment is the same as the one they took earlier that night. You go to thePlace de la Concorde and, half way around, you turn right into the ChampsElysées and drive straight up to Dodi’s flat on the right near the Arc deTriomphe (see Figure 53). At that time of night it would take only a fewminutes. But Henri Paul did not do that. He drove past the turning for theChamps Elysées, jumped the lights on red and sped down the duel carriageway tothe Pont de L’Alma. This took them AWAY from Dodi’s flat. I have heard it saidthat Paul was going a long way round to avoid the photographers and traffic, butthe photographers would have been waiting at the flat anyway by the time theygot there. And the car hit the pillar at between 60 and 80 mph. Henri Paul wasshowing no sign of turning towards Dodi’s apartment even then and as you leavethe tunnel the road takes you yet further away from their destination. What ismost important to stress here is that Henri Paul’s route was not the direct oneto Dodi’s apartment, but it did ensure that it took them through the Pont deL’Alma Tunnel, the significance of which is fantastic, as you will soonappreciate. Interestingly, it was after Paul went past the turning to Les ChampsElysees and headed towards the Pont de L’Alma that Rees-Jones put his seat belton. He says he can’t remember why, but I can help him there. There can only betwo reasons for this. Either he knew what was coming or he realised when HenriPaul screamed off from the lights that something was seriously wrong and he putthe seat belt on to protect himself. But again if that is the case, why did henot tell Dodi and Diana to do the same? And if Rees-Jones had realised apotential danger, why had Dodi and Diana not seen it and taken the appropriateaction to protect themselves? I’m sorry if that upsets Rees-Jones’ family, butgiven the circumstances these are questions that need to be asked.[../Images/00094.jpg]Figure 53: The change of route which cost Diana her life. Instead of goingdirectly to Dodi’s apartment, Henri Paul sped off in another direction away fromtheir destination. It is said that he was taking the long way round to avoid thepaparazzi, but what an amazing ‘coincidence’ that this took the car into thePont de L’Alma tunnel, one of the Babylonian Brotherhood’s most sacred sites forthe goddess Diana!Once the deed was done; the scapegoat was produced. The methods are sopredictable, but they keep working so why change them? The Lee Harvey Oswald,Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray of the Diana assassination was the driver,Henri Paul. Once the paparazzi card had been played and focused public and mediaattention in the days after the crash, it was announced that Paul was three tofour times over the French drink driving limit and that his blood containedtraces of anti-depressant drugs, including Fluoxetine, the active ingredient ofthe infamous Prozac. “The cause of the crash was simple,” we were told. “Thedriver was drunk.” Tampering with blood samples or creating alcohol in the bloodis child’s play and so is the insertion of tiny ‘balloons’ which release alcoholinto the blood stream in stages. There was certainly no sign before he droveaway from the Ritz that he was intoxicated to the extent, according to his bloodtests, that he must have drunk the equivalent of eight Scotches on an emptystomach. A behavioural psychologist on the Independent Television documentary,Diana – Secrets Of The Crash, could find no evidence that he was drunk afterstudying the Ritz videos of him that night, but there could be an explanationfor this which I will come to shortly. Only two days earlier, Paul had undergonea rigorous medical for the renewal of his pilot’s licence and there was no signof the alcohol abuse the post-crash propaganda claimed. Quite the opposite. Andthere was another strange anomaly revealed by the ITV documentary in 1998. TheHaemoglobin in Henri Paul’s blood was found to contain 20.7% carbon monoxide andthis would have been at a much higher level earlier because the carbon monoxidecontent halves every four to five hours once exposure to it has stopped.Haemoglobin carries the oxygen. Debbie Davis of the Carbon Monoxide SupportGroup said that with these levels in his blood, Henri Paul would not have knownhis left hand from his right, because of the reduced oxygen reaching the brain.Dr Alastair Hay, an expert on carbon monoxide poisoning, agreed and could notexplain why Paul showed no signs of the considerable symptoms that should havebeen evident:“I find it difficult to rationalise everything. A blood-carbon monoxide level of20% and (a high blood-alcohol level) suggests this would be someone with a muchslower reaction time, certainly be someone who would be slowed up in the way hedid things, would probably also be somebody who was in some pain, but none ofthose things appear to be evident from the pictures that we see of him. It is abit of an enigma.”47 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1680064]There is a lot more to know about Henri Paul. His best friend, Claude Garrec,told the ITV documentary that Paul had contacts within the French and foreignintelligence services and maintained them throughout his time at the Ritz. Thisis no surprise because the intelligence agencies recruit the security men at thetop hotels and the Ritz, with its VIP clientele and reputation for espionage andarms dealing, would have been a prime target. Paul certainly had unexplainedsources of income. He earned about £20-25,000 a year at the Ritz and yet he wasa keen pilot with 605 hours of flying time at about £300 an hour. He had astring of bank accounts. There were two in a bank outside Paris and threeaccounts, plus a safe deposit box, at the Banque Nationale de Paris near theRitz. He had three accounts at the nearby branch of Barclays and one current andfour deposit accounts at the Caisse D’Epargne de Paris. In the eight monthsbefore the crash, sums of £4,000 were paid into an account here on five separateoccasions. In total he had £122,000 (1.2 million francs) and no-one knows whereit came from. Then there is the question of where Paul was in the three hoursbetween 7pm when he went off duty and 10pm when Dodi called him on his mobilephone and told him to return to the Ritz. His whereabouts in this period are amystery. A very significant one.To understand how the Brotherhood operates requires immensely detailed researchover a vast array of interconnecting subjects. Everything from ancient history,to Satanic symbolism and ritual, the Earth’s magnetic grid, the power of theSun, the banking system, and mind control. The journalists who have produced thearticles and documentaries about the crash came to the subject cold and they cannever uncover the truth because they don’t understand what they are dealingwith. Their vision of possibility is limited by their indoctrinated view ofreality. They can’t see, for instance, that there are organisations withinorganisations which means that one force can work through apparently unconnectedagencies like British and French Intelligence, the Paris police and medicalservices, and the inquiry investigating the cause of the crash. I mean, youdon’t have to search far for evidence of that. Look at the Kennedy assassinationfor one. It is this lack of research of the big picture that leads reporterslike Martyn Gregory on the Dispatches programme to state categorically that“there is not a shred of credible evidence to support the conspiracy theory” andthat the suggestion of Prince Philip’s involvement was “ludicrous”. I wonderafter reading the evidence so far – and there is a great deal more to come –which you think is more ludicrous: the idea of a plot to kill Diana or MartynGregory’s statement? It was an unfortunate comment in a programme that producedsome good information about Al Fayed. Then there was the ‘investigation’ intothe crash by John Stalker, the former deputy chief constable of GreaterManchester, in the News Of The World newspaper, in which he dismissed all ideathat Diana was murdered. Ironically, Stalker claimed, quite rightly, that he wasthe victim of a conspiracy to remove him from the police force after heidentified a policy by the Northern Ireland police, the RUC, to shoot peoplethey believed were terrorists and ask the questions later. This was theso-called shoot-to-kill policy. Pushing aside every suggestion of a conspiracyto kill Diana, Stalker asked: “Why would the French want to cover up the murderof an English woman?”48 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1680197] Thenaivety of that statement is so breathtaking, I need a glass of water. At thesame time, Stalker did ask some pertinent questions about the crash and itsaftermath: “Why was the Fayed security around the princess reduced to one whollyinadequate man with no back up? Why did the police not appeal for help from thepublic? Why was there no post mortem-autopsy on Dodi Fayed’s body?” Answers:because of the very conspiracy you dismiss, Mr Stalker.One of the most important subjects to research if we are to understand how Dianawas killed, is the power and potential of mind control. I’ll give some examples.In the 1980s the best part of 30 scientists working in top secret projects,mostly computer programmers, died in very strange and unexplained circumstances.Marconi was the major company involved, but there were others like Plessey andBritish Aerospace. In 1986, Vimal Dajibhai, who was working for MarconiUnderwater Systems, drove from London to Bristol, a city with which he had noconnection, and threw himself off the famous suspension bridge there. A fewmonths before, Arshad Sharif, a computer programmer with Marconi DefenceSystems, also drove from London to Bristol and hanged himself. Why Bristol? Itis a former Knights Templar port and its name has evolved from Barati, thePhoenician goddess. It just so happens that an élite unit of BritishIntelligence called the Committee of 26 is based there and they use the runwayat the British Aerospace complex to fly British and foreign agents in and out ofthe country. I was called once, from what sounded like a plane, by a guyclaiming to represent the CIA. He said he was flying into the British Aerospacerunway to sort me out. “The Company (CIA) are not happy,” he said. Oh, Ithought, I am sorry, I do hope they cheer up soon. I drove over to meet him justto check it out, but he didn’t show. He was probably a guy who needed help, orperhaps they were seeing how I would react to threats. Either way, they got theairport right. In that period in the 1980s, not only in Bristol, there werestrange deaths galore of people at the cutting edge of development in the‘defence’ industries.What possesses a man to get into his car, drive more than two hours to theBristol Suspension Bridge, and jump off? This may seem a long way from the Dianaassassination, but it’s not. I’m talking about mind control. A CIA scientisttold me that he was put through forms of mind control to stop him recalling hisknowledge once a project was completed. I’ll give you an example of mind controlin a situation very similar to the one in Paris. David Sands was a highlyskilled scientist working in a very sensitive area of defence, but at 37 he wastalking about leaving the industry and changing his lifestyle. He was happilymarried with two small children, a son aged six and a three year old daughter.Sands and his wife had just returned from an enjoyable holiday in Venice when hedied in mysterious circumstances. Although they are not so mysterious if youunderstand mind control. He worked for Easams who, in turn, were operatingcontracts for the Ministry of Defence. It appears that while Sands and his wifewere in Venice, the company was visited by members of the élite British policeunit, the Special Branch. Then, on Saturday, March 28th 1987, David Sands toldhis wife he was going out to refuel the car, but he didn’t return for six hours.No-one has any idea where he was, but I think I do. His wife, Anna, called thepolice and constable John Hiscock was at the house when Sands returned at10.20pm. Asked the obvious question: “Where have you been?”, he said that he hadbeen driving and thinking. His wife said that it was out of character for him tobe away for so long and she didn’t think he realised how long he had been out.He seemed confused, but happy, she said. Two days later, on Monday, March 30th,he climbed into his excellently maintained Austin Maestro and began his regularjourney from his home in Itchen Abbas, near Winchester, to Easams at Camberleyin Surrey. His wife said there was nothing unusual about his demeanour orbehaviour and driving conditions were good. But about 30 minutes into thejourney when David Sands was driving along the A33 at Popham, near Basingstoke,he suddenly did a U-turn across the duel carriageway and headed at high speed inthe opposite direction to his destination. Turning onto a slip road at about 80miles an hour, Sands then drove his car straight into a disused cafe buildingkilling himself in an explosion of flame. There were no skid marks. He had noteven tried to stop.49 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1680366] It is soclear that during the time he was missing, his mind was being programmed and allit took was a trigger word, sign, sound or action, and the programming wasactivated. At that point he would have switched from his normal self to a manfocused only on driving into the cafe building and blowing himself away. Thesubconscious programming overpowers the conscious mind and robot replaces human.That, I am convinced, is what also happened to Henri Paul in Paris. Sands wentmissing for six hours before he drove into the café. Paul went missing for threehours before he drove into the 13th pillar in the Pont de L’Alma tunnel. This iswhat I suggest happened in Paris. The Brotherhood networks were working throughmany people and agencies to ensure that Diana was in Paris that night because,at its foundation, the plan was to perform a specific Satanic ritual and thetiming, circumstances and the place of death had to be arranged in intricatedetail. Diana was under Al Fayed’s security web for much of the time leading upto the crash and all of the time in those last few days. Her conversations wereheard and monitored throughout by the Al Fayed bugging system. So why don’t youmake them public, Mr Al Fayed. During his missing hours, Henri Paul, the assetof French and British Intelligence, was being programmed for his role, orperhaps the final touches were being put to programming already installed.Diana’s ritual death was arranged from the very top of the Brotherhood and, bycomparison, people like Al Fayed are small and powerless nonentities, pawns inthe game they probably do not fully understand. The Mercedes which was broughtto the rear entrance of the Ritz had been stolen some weeks earlier – before theDiana-Dodi relationship began – and when it was recovered it underwent extensiverepairs. It had been standing outside the exclusive Taillevent restaurant whenthe driver’s door was flung open and the chauffeur pulled out by threeArabic-speaking men with hand guns. The vehicle was missing for two weeks andwhen it was found the wheels were missing, the door ripped off, and theelectronic system and equipment controlling the braking system had gone. AlFayed, as we have seen, controlled the company, Etoile Limousines, whichsupplied the vehicle. No wonder the French authorities turned down the offer byexperts from Mercedes to examine the car after the crash.When Henri Paul came back on duty that night he seemed his normal self to mostobservers. The programming was deep within his psyche still waiting to beactivated. He may well have had a couple of alcoholic drinks in the Ritz bar,but his intake and demeanour did not correspond with the later medical report.Claims that he was an alcoholic also do not match with the examination of hisliver. But if, as I suggest, Henri Paul was a mind controlled ‘multiple’ hecould have been drunk in one compartment of his mind and not in another. I haveheard from recovering ‘multiples’ who have experienced this. Someone close toPaul that night, his handler, was switching his compartments. In this way hecould have had a considerable level of alcohol in his blood while, in somecompartments, he would have been unaffected by it. The same with the carbonmonoxide. Just before or just after the Mercedes pulled away from the Ritz,Henri Paul was given the trigger which activated the programming. It could havebeen a sound, a sign, a colour or more likely a word or sentence. With Paul’ssubconscious programming now overwhelming his conscious mind, he sped away tothe Place de la Concorde and down the dual carriageway to the Pont de L’Alma.Rees-Jones put his seat belt on, but apparently did not alert Diana and Dodi tothe danger. Thus they stay unbelted. As Paul entered the Pont d L’Alma tunnel atan estimated 80 miles an hour (some reports say slower), he braked fiercely,scraped the right hand wall of the tunnel, and then aimed the car at the 13thpillar. It is the 13th pillar that gives it away. The Brotherhood throughouthistory has had such an obsession with the number 13 that to believe this was acoincidence is taking chance to the level of fantasy. There must be 30 pillarsin that tunnel and the car hit the 13th because it was meant to. Diana had anaversion to the number 13 and she would not allow a 13th lot in her dressauction at Christies the June before she died. If, as some witnesses havesuggested, the crash was caused by the Mercedes hitting a white Fiat Uno or by amotorcyclist flashing a powerful light into Paul’s eyes from a motor cycle,there is no way he could be sure of hitting the 13th pillar. But a person with adeeply programmed subconscious would be able to put the car right on the button,even at speed.Mark Phillips is the man who helped to deprogramme Cathy O’Brien when she was amind controlled slave of the CIA. He has worked in these fields for much of hisadult life and after I reached my conclusions about the events in Paris, I ranghim to ask if it would be possible to mind control Henri Paul to pick out thatpillar at speed. Mark was in no doubt: “Yes, Yes” he said “More than yes,absolutely yes”. He pointed out that the subconscious worked much faster thanthe conscious mind and to the subconscious 80 miles an hour would actually bequite slow compared with its ability to think and react. If the speed wasconsiderably slower as some reports suggest, it would have been even easier.“There are many techniques they could have used to programme his mind duringthose three hours he was missing”, Mark said. The number of ways they could havecaused the crash, another vehicle, an explosive device, stun weapons, etc, etc,would fill a book and any of them is possible on the face of it. But not if theywanted to be sure of hitting the 13th pillar, which they did. To do that, theyneeded a driver with a programmed subconscious.I think the stories about the mysterious Fiat Uno and the motorcyclist with theflashing light are diversions to lead researchers away from the simple truth. Somuch time and effort has been wasted on the Fiat in particular, fueled by AlFayed’s own investigation team. Whenever such assassinations are staged, thereare always a stream of false ‘clues’ and ‘leads’ which divert attention. TheKennedy assassination was full of them. Another possibility for the cause of thecrash is external control of the car. Randulph Fiennes, famous for his polarexpeditions, was an officer in the Royal Scots Greys and attached to the éliteSAS. He wrote a book about a secret group of assassins called the Clinic and howthey murdered people while making it look like an accident. The death of MajorMichael Marman is particularly relevant to what could have happened in Paris. Hewas driving a Citroen 2CV along the A303 near Stonehenge in November 1986 when aBMW coming the other way careered across the carriageway and killed himinstantly. Fiennes says that the BMW had been tampered with and the brakingsystem was operated by remote control which could override the normal system viacompressed air from a tiny scuba diving cylinder hidden in the enginecompartment. The remote control equipment was operated from a Volvo whichfollowed the BMW, Fiennes reported. The BMW was driven by Sir Peter Horsley, aretired Air Marshall, who survived the crash. Fiennes says that the Clinic knewthat Horsley would be travelling along that road at the same time as theirtarget. In his autobiography, Sounds From Another Room, Horsley says that he wasaccelerating to about 60 miles an hour when the car began to react strangely. Hesaw a grey Volvo closing up quickly behind him and as he was about to wave itpast, his BMW spun sharply to the left, the brakes screeching, and then sharplyto the right and back again. This is remarkably similar to what happened to theMercedes before it struck the 13th pillar. Horsley was by now desperately tryingto maintain control and he went on:“Out of the corner of my eye I saw the grey Volvo accelerating past me at highspeed. My car had now developed a mind of its own as it swung broadside andskidded down the road. With a lurch it hit the central reservation, mounted thegrass verge separating the two lanes of the highway and crossed over into theopposite carriageway. I had just time to see a small car approaching from theopposite direction. I hit it sideways on with tremendous force. In asplit-second the driver’s horror-stricken face was visible and I heard hishoarse scream.”50 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1680628]It is possible that Diana’s Mercedes was externally controlled in this way,because it is clear that the steering on Horsley’s BMW was also remotelycontrolled. Certainly a highly skilled operator could direct the Mercedes intothe 13th pillar. Support for the contention that no other car was directlyinvolved in Diana’s crash comes from Eric Petel who claims to have seen thecrash. Petel says that he was riding his motorcycle towards the entrance to thetunnel when he was overtaken by the Mercedes. No other vehicle was nearby. Hesaid:“I saw a car in my rear-view mirrors flashing its headlamps. I moved across tolet it by and it raced past even though I was doing about 70 miles per hour. Aninstant later I heard a deafening noise and saw the accident. The car wasspinning in the road… I stopped. There were no other cars or bikes around at alland I could see all the way through the tunnel. The roof of the Mercedes wastotally smashed in. The right hand rear door was partly open and I looked in andsaw a woman. She seemed to have been thrown forward from the back seat and hadher head between the front seats.”51[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1680883]Petel said blood was flowing from her right ear and as he brushed her hair fromher face and placed her head on the arm rest, he realised it was Princess Diana.Her eyelashes were fluttering, but she had not opened her eyes at this stage, hesaid. Petel estimates he was at the scene for about a minute before climbingback on his bike to ring the police. He told them that Diana had been in anaccident, but they laughed and told him to stop wasting their time. In despairat this, he rode to the police station in Avenue Mozart. His lawyer, AntoineDeguines, says that Petel was kept waiting for 25 minutes and taken into abackroom where he was handcuffed. For reporting an ‘accident’? When eventuallyfreed, he was told to follow a police car to another police station where hegave a statement which he signed without reading. “I was outraged” he said “Theydidn’t seem to care about the crash.” He heard nothing from the authorities formonths before he enlisted help from a lawyer to tell his story to the officialinquiry.Whenever an assassination occurs in a public place, two things happen. Theperson named as responsible is a ‘patsy’ or ‘scapegoat’, most often these daysunder mind control, and diversions galore are created to lead investigators awayfrom the truth of what happened. The first method allows you to make animmediate arrest, or expose the person to blame, and no further investigationsare necessary because everyone knows who was responsible. We have seen thistechnique with Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, Timothy McVeigh, and now HenriPaul. It is endless. The second method, the diversion, ensures that the crucialhours and days after the event are wasted as people chase a mass of falsestories and ‘leads’.This was a technique used in Paris with the paparazzi, theflashing lights from motorcycles and later the Fiat Uno. Also when people arefed a constant barrage of conflicting reports and theories they become confusedand a confused mind switches off and loses interest. This is the role, forinstance, of American tabloids like The National Enquirer. They have adifferent, and increasingly ludicrous Diana theory almost every week, and theyare doing the same with the murder of JFK Junior. Interestingly, they would notmention the evidence in this book, even though they were sent a copy. So firstthe media and authorities tell you the paparazzi were to blame, then they werenot. Then they tell you the car speedometer was found stuck at 120 miles anhour, then they say it was found on zero.I thought it strange how many American witnesses to the crash were quicklylocated. The Pont and Place de L’Alma were not, before Diana’s death, a populartourist area. There is nothing there except a restaurant or two, a tunnel, and amaze of crossing roads. And yet at 12.25 in the morning, several Americantourists say they witnessed what happened. The number of witnesses in generalwas unusual anyway, given the late hour and the fact that Paris empties at thattime of year as vast numbers of Parisians take their annual holiday to theFrench coastal resorts. I can understand that some people in the few carstravelling along the road at the time may have seen the crash and its immediateaftermath, but I know from visiting the spot myself, that the main pedestrianroutes have virtually no view of the tunnel at all. The police failed to controlthe crash scene according to normal police procedure and so much evidence waslost immediately. They failed to question important witnesses and leaked someinformation while maintaining unshakable secrecy over other areas of theinvestigation.52 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681064] It all stinks.Today there is an added challenge for would-be assassins and assassination plotswith the ‘traffic’ cameras that are located all over cities. Smile, you’re onTV. It would be impossible to keep secret the methods and personnel used to killDiana if the whole thing was being videoed. But when you are the Brotherhoodwith connections at the highest levels in politics, police and intelligenceagencies, the traffic cameras present no such problem. You simply switch themoff! There are 17 traffic cameras on the route between the Ritz and the Pont deL’Alma, including those inside the tunnel itself. If they had been working thatnight there would be no mystery, because you could play back the whole event onyour television set. One camera looks down on the entrance to the tunnel andwould have recorded any Fiat Uno or men on motorbikes with flashing lights. Butthat camera, like all the others, was switched off at the crucial moment. Neverbefore in Paris had the whole system malfunctioned at the same time and thepolice refuse to explain what happened. The system runs on an independent powersupply and it is controlled by the police and, ultimately, by the FrenchIntelligence agencies, because the cameras are there to monitor far more thanjust traffic problems. At the same time as the camera system failed all thepolice communication frequencies in central Paris also went off. Simon Reagan inhis excellent book, Who Killed Diana?, quotes a contact called André who, likemany people, loves to listen in to police radio messages. André was sitting on abench near the Eiffel Tower, a few minutes walk from the Pont de L’Alma, on thenight Diana died. He was, as usual, using a receiver to monitor the policecommunications. But suddenly, at 12.20am, all the lines went down. There was aradio blackout. It lasted for 20 minutes and then, André said, the signal cameback and there was a mass of radio traffic as people all wanted to talk at once.“I have never… come across such chaotic radio traffic”, he said. “It wasextraordinary.” When the lines went down Diana was leaving the Ritz on her lastjourney alive. By the time they came back she was lying in the tunnel under thecomplete control of the emergency team and according to the autopsy reportwithin a few minutes of clinical death. And there is not a shred of credibleevidence for a conspiracy, is there, eh? My God, it’s in our face. But withinten days of the crash, the French police had produced a 350 page preliminaryreport which assumed it was an accident and they did not consider any otherpossibility.Now, talking of that ‘emergency team’ brings me to another vital point. As acontact on the fringes of British Intelligence told me, causing the crash iseasy for the powers involved, but you cannot be sure of killing your target.Therefore you have your people controlling the medical team because, althoughyour target hasn’t died, there is now a credible reason for them to die. Therehas been a crash. The medical team’s job (or those in charge, anyway) is to makesure that the target does not survive, no matter what condition they may be into start with. Even those who dismiss the idea that Diana was murdered havequestioned the astonishing delay in getting her to hospital when, according tothe official medical reports, she was suffering from an injury that requiredurgent surgery. The doctors say that the pulmonary vein had been ruptured nearthe heart and this was filling her lungs with blood. Diana was lying in thetunnel bleeding to death, if that is correct. The only way her life was going tobe saved with such an injury was through immediate surgery. So why was it morethan an hour and a half before she arrived at the hospital? Within a minute ofimpact, Doctor Frederic Mailliez with an American ‘friend’ Mark Butt, drove intothe tunnel from the opposite direction. A private investigator I know has madeextensive inquiries into Mailliez and Butt and, while these investigationscontinue, his findings strongly suggest there is more to both of them than weare being told. The crash happened at 12.25am and by 12.26, Doctor Mailliez saidhe had seen the crushed Mercedes, stopped his car, turned on warning lights, runacross to the Mercedes to establish there were two people dead and two alive andhad rung the emergency services. This man must be a seriously quick worker. Heis one of 160 Parisian doctors who are on constant call for emergencies inhospitals and private homes as part of a French insurance system, SOS Medecins.He had treated accident victims many times when he was a member of SAMU, theFrench emergency ambulance service. And yet a doctor on constant call foremergencies says that all he had in his car to help Diana was an oxygen cylinderand mask! Mailliez was in control of Diana and her condition for the crucial 15to 20 minutes before his former employers, the SAMU emergency team, arrived totake over. He claims that Diana did not say anything to him, but thiscontradicts his comment to the London Times that “She kept saying how much shehurt as I put a resuscitation mask over her mouth”. Trevor Rees-Jones, thebodyguard, also says he had flashbacks of hearing a female voice calling out inthe back of the car: “First it’s a groan. Then Dodi’s name was called… And thatcan only be Princess Diana’s voice” he told the Daily Mirror. 53[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681205] How reliable that statement is,however, is open to debate. What does seem to be clear is that Diana wasconscious or at least semiconscious when Mailliez arrived. He told the CNN chatshow host, Larry King, that: “She looked pretty fine. At the beginning… from theoutside, you know, she looked pretty fine. But inside, you know, the internalinjury was already starting… It’s really funny. That’s the only part, where shewas sitting, that’s the only part which was still intact.” Mailliez on one handtold a French medical magazine that: “I thought her life could be saved” and yetsaid another time that “It was hopeless. There was nothing we could do to saveher.” He also told King that although Diana is the most photographed woman inthe world, and the paparazzi were taking shots of her while he was with her inthe tunnel, he had no idea that she was Princess Diana until he saw the newsreports the following morning. Excuse me? The pigs are airborne again. When theemergency team arrived, Malliez says he left the scene because there was nothingmore he could do.The official explanation for the incredible delay in taking Diana to hospital isthat she was trapped in the wreckage. This is a lie, lie, lie. One of theambulance crew told the French newspaper, La Parisien, that when he arrivedDiana was lying with most of her body out of the car with her legs resting onthe rear seat. “She was agitated, semi knocked out, but conscious… she wasgroaning and struggling feebly. She murmured ‘Oh my God’ several times.” TheScotsman newspaper, in an investigation published on September 11th 1997,established that Diana was removed from the car shortly after the fire brigadearrived and the excuse of her being ‘trapped’ does not stand up. Anotherofficial excuse for the delay is that the emergency doctors had to give her ablood transfusion. This is another lie, lie, lie. SAMU teams do not carry bloodtransfusion equipment because they would not know the victim’s blood type. Whenthe ambulance did leave the tunnel, the driver was ordered to go no faster than25 miles an hour and some reports say it took as long as 40 minutes to cover the3.7 miles (6km) to the La Pitie-Salpetriere. Four other hospitals quite capableof treating Diana were closer to the scene and the ambulance stopped twice onthe way for ‘delicate interventions’, one of them within sight of the hospital.Diana arrived at La Pitie-Salpetriere about 2.10am, an hour and 45 minutes afterthe crash happened. By any medical criteria whatsoever this delay was utterlyludicrous, unless it was meant to happen. It doesn’t take a genius to see why,despite such apparent incompetence, there has been no inquiry into the medicalresponse that night. Waiting at the hospital were a surgical team headed byProfessor Bruno Riou, the duty surgeon who, we are told, first heard about thecrash while doing his rounds. Is it only me that finds it strange that arenowned surgeon is ‘doing his rounds’ in the early hours of the morning?Waiting with him when Diana arrived were Professor Pierre Coriat, the head ofanaesthetics, Professor Alain Pavie, a chest and heart specialist, and ProfessorPierre Benazet, another experienced surgeon. They had been in telephonecommunication with the emergency team in the tunnel throughout. We are told theyopened Diana’s chest cavity, repaired the vein, and ‘battled to save her’ for anhour and a half before admitting defeat. I find this remarkable, also, becausethe autopsy report apparently shows that Diana was clinically dead at 12.45amwhile still lying in the tunnel. She would therefore have been clinically deadfor an hour and 25 minutes before she even arrived at the hospital and for threehours before the professors walked out of the operating theatre to announce thatshe had died. Having the body examined at a location you control is vital insuch assassinations. President Kennedy’s body was flown immediately out ofDallas to the Brotherhood-front, the Bethesda Naval Center near Washington DC,for the post mortem. Here the president’s brain went missing (or hislook-alike’s did) and, as the US Assassination Records Review Board revealed,the autopsy notes and the first draft of the post mortem were burned.So who was behind Diana’s assassination? It is important to stress that thosewho gave the order and those who did the deed would be very different. We arelooking at a Brotherhood here, a spider’s web, and while the order will havecome from the spider or spiders in the centre, it will have been mostly carriedout by the flies. It is highly unlikely that it would have been done directly byBritish Intelligence because that would be too obvious. Intelligence agenciessubcontract the assassinations of their own citizens to put them at arms lengthfrom the incident and to allow them to ‘plausibly deny’ that they wereresponsible. For instance, there is considerable evidence that President Kennedywas shot by members of an élite rifle team within a renegade unit of FrenchIntelligence called the OAS, or at least that they were involved in the plot.Olof Palme, the Bilderberger Prime Minister of Sweden, was murdered in Stockholmin 1986 on the orders of, among others, George Bush. But the killing was carriedout by members of BOSS, the South African Intelligence agency (see …And TheTruth Shall Set You Free). The British Foreign Office has its own assassinationsquad called Group 13 (that number again) and British Intelligence has a longand sick history of political and economic assassinations. British Intelligenceconsists of MI5 (Military Intelligence 5) which is responsible officially fordomestic security, and MI6 which deals with overseas matters. MI5 announced in1988 that they do not assassinate people. No, they get others to do it for them.This pathetic denial was prompted by the revelations of the former MI5 agent,David Shayler, that MI6 had organised a plot to assassinate Libya’s ColonelGaddafi. The attempt had failed because the bomb was put under the wrong car.Shayler was head of the ‘Libyan Desk’ at MI5 and was in the perfect position toknow. Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, who is so far out of his depth he needsa frogman’s suit, said that he had been assured that no such event took place.Oh, that’s OK then. The attorney-general banned David Shayler from appearing onthe ITV programme, Diana – Secrets of the Crash, and later Shayler was arrestedand jailed in Paris awaiting extradition to London. Why do that if what he issaying is such nonsense? Because, of course, he’s right. By the way, the oath ofallegiance by British Intelligence officers is not to the government, but to themonarch. It is the same with Members of Parliament and the military. Ultimatelythe Queen is their boss under the law, although, in truth, their boss is whoevercontrols the Queen because even she is not at the top of the pile.The type of organisation most likely to have been involved in Diana’s death, atthe operational level is typified by the Pinay Circle or ‘Le Cercle’ which has anumber of British establishment figures in its ranks. Le Cercle is an offshootof the even more élite Safari Club, which was set up by Count Alexander deMaranches, the Director during the 1970s of the French Service for ExternalDocumentation and Espionage. It was the Safari Club which arranged for thealliance between a French Intelligence front-company called Group Bull and thecomputer giant Honeywell which is, you will be surprised to know, the world’sbiggest manufacturer of landmines. This alliance supplied landmines to bothsides in the Bosnian conflict. The Safari Club began as a consortium of thesecret police of the Shah of Iran called SAVAK, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, AnwarSadat of Egypt and Saudi Arabian Intelligence. It has been involved in countlesscoups in Africa to further its goals and is heavily involved in arms trading andsupply. Out of the Safari Club came the Pinay Circle or Le Cercle, named afterthe French Prime Minister, Antoine Pinay, who attended the first BilderbergMeeting in Oosterbeek, Holland, in May 1954. Others involved with Le Cercleincluded the reptilian, shape-shifting, Habsburg family. To give you an idea ofits make up and range of influence, the Le Cercle membership has includedNicholas Elliot, a department head at MI6; William Colby, a former director ofthe CIA; Colonel Botta of Swiss Military Intelligence; Stefano Della Chiaie, aleading member of the Italian Secret Service; Giullo Andreotti, the formerItalian Prime Minister from the notorious P2 Freemasonry Lodge and the man whogave the Mafia official protection; Silva Munoz, a former minister for thefascist, Franco, in Spain and a member of the Elite secret society, Opus Dei;Franz Josef Strauss, the German defence minister; and Monsignor Brunello, anagent to the Vatican. In America, one of the Le Cercle fronts is the CIA-backedHeritage Foundation in Washington. Look at the potential for such anorganisation to be the coordinating force between countless different agenciesand countries all to achieve a common aim. The Safari Club-Le Cercle networkprovides the Arab-British-French connection necessary to arrange for Diana to bein Paris at the right time, the security for her to be withdrawn, theassassination to be carried out, and those involved to get away with it. Whatwas that John Stalker said? “Why would the French want to cover up the murder ofa British woman?” It is also interesting that Simon Regan in his book, WhoKilled Diana?, says that it was Le Cercle which destablised the Gough Whitlamgovernment in Australia in 1975. The Queen was certainly involved in that, too.As I explained earlier, it was her Governor of Australia, Philip Kerr, whoremoved Whitlam in the end. If the Windsors and Le Cercle worked together tobring down an elected Australian Government, why could they not have workedtogether to eliminate Diana?Paris, with its immense Brotherhood associations going back centuries, has longbeen a favourite location for their murders and plots. Amschel Rothschild fromthe English branch of the family, was murdered there in his hotel room in 1996in what some claim to have been part of one of the inter-Brotherhood wars whichhave littered their history. For an organisation like Le Cercle, or its manymirrors in London, it would have been easy to place its people in the rightplaces. Mohamed Al Fayed’s security operation is awash with former members ofélite British military and police units who know the consequences of saying “No”to the Brotherhood, even if they don’t wish to be involved. In the same way,these spider structures ensure that their people control the inquiries intotheir assassinations, as they did most famously with Kennedy. Even Mohamed AlFayed’s personal investigation into Diana’s death was headed by PierreOttavoili, a former chief of the Criminal Brigade, the criminal investigationdepartment of French Police. This is the same organisation which is alsoresponsible for the official investigation. Al Fayed’s chief lawyer in Paris isa former French Justice Minister, and in overall charge in London is JohnMacnamara, his head of security and a former Chief Superintendent at theheadquarters of London’s Metropolitan Police, Scotland Yard. In the Spring of1998, Macnamara was part of a ‘sting’ operation involving the FBI, CIA andpossibly, the Israeli (Rothschild) Intelligence Agency, Mossad, to arrest aformer CIA agent Oswald Le Winter, a 67-year-old American born in Austria. LeWinter contacted Al Fayed claiming to have documents for sale proving theinvolvement of MI6 and the CIA in Diana’s murder. He was asking $10 million andafter a meeting with Macnamara he was given an advance of $15,000. A furthermeeting was arranged in Vienna, Austria, for the key documents and the rest ofthe money to be handed over. In the meantime, however, Al Fayed called a friendin the FBI, who contacted the CIA. Le Winter was followed, spied on, and luredto the Ambassador Hotel in Vienna on Wednesday April 22nd, where with supportfrom the Austrian police a combination of FBI, CIA and possibly Mossad agentspounced on him. All this for an alleged hoaxer? The story would have remainedsecret, but for Peter Grolig, an Austrian journalist on the Kurier newspaper. Hereported what happened and established that when Le Winter’s hotel room wassearched, four documents, two of them in code, were found and appeared to begenuine CIA documents. The CIA have since admitted tapping Diana’s phone callsin, and to, America and passing the contents to British Intelligence. Le Winterwas arrested and held in custody. Grolig’s story forced Al Fayed to admit thatit was true. So was Le Winter trapped by such an array of international securitypersonnel because he was selling a hoax to Al Fayed or because he was sellingthe truth? Another intelligence insider also insists the crash was not anaccident. Richard Tomlinson, a former agent of Britain’s MI6, gave evidence tothe French inquiry into Diana’s death. In 1997 Tomlinson served a six month jailsentence under the Official Secrets Act for trying to sell his memoirs. InAugust 1998 he was arrested again, at gun point, in Paris at the request of theBritish Government who were concerned at his association in that city with theMI5 whistle-blower, David Shayler, who was also arrested and jailed in Paris.54[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681333] Tomlinson apparently told HerveStephan, the judge in charge of the ‘inquiry’, that Diana was murdered.According to a report on the BBC’s news service, Ceefax, on August 28th 1998, hetold the judge that Henri Paul was an asset of British Intelligence and so was“One of the bodyguards”. Which one was not named. Meanwhile Herve Stephan, aBrotherhood placeman, is doing all he can to hold the line that it was anaccident and that, indeed, was what his long drawn out official reportconcluded. I am so surprised.The most important question to ask when you are trying to identify thoseresponsible for a crime is: “Who benefits?” As the Roman writer, Seneca, said:“He who most benefits from a crime is the one most likely to have committed it”.Well the Windsors benefited magnificently. No longer is Diana there to continueher inevitable destruction of the Monarchy’s credibility and public esteem withher actions and her knowledge of their secrets. No longer is she there to bringher influence on the upbringing and attitudes of the future king, Prince Williamand his brother Prince Harry. The Windsors now have complete control of them, tomould them into their image. They couldn’t do that before because Diana’sinfluence was too strong and I hope the memory of that will encourage theprinces to withstand the indoctrination. The way is now paved for Charles’marriage to Camilla Parker-Bowles without the complication of Diana and, ofcourse, his royal duty to produce Windsor heirs with Spencer genes, although aswe shall see, William might not be his child. Understandably, it has beensuggested that Diana was killed because of her campaign against landmines. Thisis not true, not directly anyway. The landmine manufacturers have done verynicely from her campaign, because they make far more money from clearing minesthan they do making them. A mine costs about £30 to produce, but at least £3,000to clear. Clearing all the mines around the world is estimated at £330 billion.No, the landmine manufacturers like Honeywell were not against Diana’s campaign,they loved it for their own reasons. But what she showed very clearly was thepower she had to take an issue from the shadows and hurl it into the publicarena. The question could well have been: “What will she do next?”. And what wasit that Diana had to reveal, as she told my contact, that would “Shake theworld”? Henry Kissinger, one of the greatest Brotherhood manipulators of the20th century, met Diana a number of times and sickeningly attended her funeral.He said in an interview after her death that: “She was politically anddiplomatically uncontrollable”. That is Kissinger-speak for “That’s one reasonshe was killed”. From the perspective of the operational level of theBrotherhood pyramid, as with Kennedy, there were many reasons why they wantedher dead. But, as I keep emphasising, that is only one level. At the top are theElite black magic adepts, the reptilian full bloods and crossbreeds. At thehighest level of the Brotherhood, Diana’s death, like Kennedy’s, was a ritualkilling. It was long planned for the effect it would have on the people and themagnetic field of the Earth, and to symbolise the introduction of the New WorldOrder. Don’t underestimate the fantastic power of ritual and symbolism inaffecting the human psyche and the planet’s magnetic field. These people are notobsessed with it for no reason.The Brotherhood and Satanic symbolism surrounding Diana’s death is endless andto understand the background to her ritual murder we must, once again, go back avery long time. Diana was one of the greatest goddesses of the ancient world andshe represented the female energy also known as Barati, Britannia, Isis,Artemis, Aphrodite, all these different names for the same energy. Diana wasalso Di-Anu, the Goddess Anu. If you go back far enough, they symbolise the sameentity, also, Ninkharsag. Diana was known as a Moon goddess. One tribe of Elitebloodlines who worshipped the goddess Diana were called the Sicambrian Frankswho can be traced from Troy (that name again), through Asia Minor, now Turkey,the Caucasus Mountains (again) and up into Europe. They lived at one time in anarea west of the River Danube and settled in Germania, named by the Romans afterthe Scythian ‘genuine ones’ with their centre in Cologne. They also invadedparts of Roman-occupied Gaul, the land which is now Belgium and northern France,from where many of the ‘noble’ families of Scotland were to come. It is fromthese Sicambrian Franks that we get the name France. At the time of KingMeroveus, who was named Guardian of the Franks in 448, this people became knownas the Merovingians and Princess Diana, through the Stuart bloodline, wasrelated to them. Many seem to believe that the Merovingians are descended fromthe bloodline of Jesus, but how they can be genetically descended from a mythdefeats me. This is a diversion to mislead. They are, however, an Elitebloodline that goes back to the Aryan race in the ancient Middle and Near Eastand eventually goes off planet to the reptilians. The Merovingians were thesorcerer kings who were noted for their esoteric knowledge and magical powerswhich they inherited from the underground bloodline streams of secret groups andinitiations. Francio, the founder of the Franks, claimed to be a descendant ofNoah and his ancestors once resided in ancient Troy of wooden horse fame. TheFrench city of Troyes, where the Templars were officially formed, was named bythe Sicambrian Franks after their former home. The Iliad says that Troy wasfounded by Dardanus, the son of the Greek god Zeus, the ‘Titan’ (giant race),who was depicted as both an eagle and a serpent. Zeus was born in Arcadia inSparta, it is said, and the Spartans migrated into France. These are thebloodlines we are talking about here, not those of ‘Jesus’.The city of Paris was established by the Sicambrian Franks in the 6th centuryafter they became known as the Merovingians (Ramses-Piso-Bush). It was namedafter Prince Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy. It was the relationshipbetween Prince Paris and Helen of Sparta which supposedly caused the Trojan Warin which the Trojan Horse (infiltration) assured victory for the Spartans. Boththe Trojans and the Spartans were branches of the same Aryan peoples and withinthem were the reptilian bloodlines. Paris in those days was confined to anisland in the River Seine which is now known as the Ile de la Cite or Isle ofthe City. The Notre Dame Cathedral, built by the Templars on a site of formerDiana worship, stands on the Ile de la Cite today and this is where the TemplarGrand Master, Jacques de Molay, was roasted to death. The Merovingians,ancestors of the Windsors, established the city of Paris on a major vortex pointwhich is why the Notre Dame Cathedral is built on that spot. Meroveus, thefounder of the Merovingian dynasty, followed the goddess cult of Diana and thisis not surprising because the epicentre for Diana worship was at the famoustemple at Ephesus in Asia Minor, not far from the alleged site of Troy. Thetemple is named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Diana wasknown as Queen of Heaven, just like Semiramis. Outside the original Paris – andnow very much inside the modern city – the Merovingians established anunderground chamber for the worship of the goddess Diana and for the bloodrituals and human sacrifices to her. This site dates back at least to 500–750 ADand it was here that kings in dispute over property would settle the issue incombat. According to legend, anyone killed there goes straight to Heaven andsits at the right hand of God. Now get this: The location today of thisunderground sacrificial site for the goddess Diana is… the Pont de L’Almatunnel!The word pont relates to Pontifex, a Roman high priest, and it means passage orbridge. Alma comes from Al-Mah, a Middle Eastern name for, wait for it… the Moongoddess. So the Pont de L’Alma translates as ‘Bridge of the Moon Goddess’ andthe adjoining Place de L’Alma is the ‘Place of the Moon Goddess’. And the Moongoddess is Diana. It can also translate as ‘Bridge of the Soul’ and a ‘Maiden’of the goddess Diana was called an Al-mah! This is why Henri Paul was programmedto drive past the turning to Dodi Fayed’s flat and head for the Pont de L’Almatunnel. This is why the emergency team kept her in the tunnel for so longinstead of rushing her to hospital where her life would have been saved. Shewasn’t meant to be saved and they only moved her when she was clinically dead,as the autopsy report confirmed. According to Brotherhood Satanic ritual, Dianahad to die in that underground chamber on the ancient sacrificial site and ithad to happen at night under the Moon in the goddess month of August, ruledaccording to legend by the Roman version of Isis, Diana, etc: Juno Augusta. TheSatanists in the emergency team simply ensured that Diana would not leave thetunnel (sacrificial chamber) alive. We are told she bled to death and, if thisis correct, it was precisely in accordance with their blood rites andsacrificial rites. But was the bleeding caused in the way we are told, or bysome other chemical means? We now know that Diana was clinically dead about12.45 am, yet she was taken to the La Pitie Salpetriere Hospital and kept in theoperating theatre for an hour and a half while the medical team, Professor BrunoRiou, Professor Pierre Coriat, Professor Alain Pavie and Professor Jean PierreBenazat, cut open her chest and “battled to save her”. Save a woman who hadalready been clinically dead for an hour and fifteen minutes when she arrived atthe hospital? When they had finished, the French Minister of the Interior,Jean-Pierre Chevenement, decreed, according to his senior advisor, Sami Mani,that there would be strictly no admittance to the room in which her body waslaid out.55 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681464] Chevenement was one ofseveral ‘VIPs’ who rushed to the tunnel and observed the medical operation atthis former sacrificial site.56 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681561]The Brotherhood Mother Goddess, Arizona Wilder, said that Guy de Rothschild hadtalked about Diana’s death in early 1998 when he tried to reprogramme her at ahouse in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. Rothschild was using a pseudonym, DrBarrington. He said that he was in the tunnel that night to “Steal Diana’s soul”through the ‘evil eye’ hypnotic gaze the reptiles use at the point of death. Iexplained this earlier in relation to Pindar. A contact in Denmark told me thatduring her last year of medical studies at the Copenhagen University in 1983 sherealised that severely mentally ill patients were being used for experiments bybeing inseminated with genetically tampered semen. The pregnancy, she said, wasvery painful and often unsuccessful. Sometimes the patient died and the foetuswas dissected in secrecy. She went on: “The doctors conducting these experimentswere professors, heads of departments, PhDs, the most outstanding in theirfield. They had a kind of Brotherhood… many of them were psychic and monkeyedwith black magic. Incredible amounts of money were flowing to them.” A storythat could be repeated thousands of times all over the world.Another name for the goddess Diana is Hecate. One of the ancient ‘triads’ or‘trinities’ was that of Diana, Luna and Hecate who were said to be three aspectsof the same female energy. It was called Diana on Earth, Luna in Heaven, andHecate in Hell. Hecate is one of the premier deities of Satanism and she is aversion of Aphrodite and Venus, different names for the same energy. After herhusband’s death, Jackie Kennedy travelled to the Greek island of Delos in thesouth west Aegean Sea, the legendary birthplace of Diana and Apollo and theconsidered domain of Hecate, the goddess of the ‘infernal arts’. Delos is knownfor this reason as the Island of the Dead. Hecate was portayed as both thevirgin and the whore and crossroads are the sacred places of Diana-Hecate. It isat crossroads that the witches and the Grand Masters and sorcerers ofFreemasonry perform their rituals. Crossroads are symbolic of the vortex pointscreated where ley lines cross. In ritual sex magic, the wearing of clothes ofthe opposite sex and the performance of bisexual acts are called ‘CrossroadRites’. The women involved were called ‘dikes’. Crossroads are also places ofhuman and animal sacrifice and Hecate is known as a ‘sex and death goddess’ andthe goddess of witchcraft and sorcery. At the Pont de L’Alma, right at the spotwhere Diana died, the road that goes through the tunnel is crossed on thesurface by another road which leads onto the Pont de L’Alma Bridge. In fact thisspot is a maze of crossroads. And Diana died in the early morning of August31st. Hecate’s Day in the Satanic calendar is August 13th, but under the Sataniclaw of reverse symbolism and reverse numbers, Hecate’s day of sacrifice is…August 31st!!So just look at the symbolism of this. Diana, named after the ancient Moongoddess, was driven from the Ritz and through the Place de la Concorde where shepassed the 3,200 year-old Egyptian obelisk brought to Paris from Luxor with it’stip or pyramid coloured bright gold symbolising the penis of Osiris. It was atthis very point, a minute from where Diana died, that Queen Marie Antoinette wasbeheaded at the guillotine during the Brotherhood-engineered French Revolution,another symbolic blood sacrifice of the female energy. Diana was then driven atspeed to the Pont de L’Alma tunnel, the Bridge or Place of the Moon Goddess,where the car struck the 13th pillar, the symbolism for which is simply enormousfor obvious reasons and for others I’ll come to later. Now she was left to dieon the very site of an ancient underground sacrificial chamber to the goddessDiana and bled to death according to Satanic ritual. She also died at acrossroads with one road under the ground, the other above, and the crossroadsis the sacred place for the Satanic deity, Hecate, another aspect of the ‘Diana’energy. And it all happened on Hecate’s day for sacrifice, August 31st. Doesanyone doubt that this was a ritual murder? And I’ve not even nearly finishedwith the symbolism surrounding her death. Remember what David Berkowitz, theSatanist serial killer in New York known as the Son of Sam, wrote about thoseinvolved in the Satanic network:“…Satanists (genuine ones) are peculiar people. They aren’t ignorant peasants orsemiliterate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors, lawyers,businessmen, and basically highly responsible citizens… They are not a carelessgroup who are apt to make mistakes. But they are secretive and bonded togetherby a common need and desire to mete out havoc on society. It was AleisterCrowley who said: ‘I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything bad’.”57[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681703]It is worth emphasising again here the Satanists’ relationship with femaleenergy. The challenge we all face is to balance male and female energies and soenjoy the best aspects of them and not the extremes. The Satanists, however,seek to express only the extremes, thus creating disharmony and conflict. Theyuse the malevolent, highly negative expressions of the female energy (covertmanipulation behind the scenes) to create the events and circumstances which theextremes of the male energy (macho men, soldiers, terrorism) can play out in thepublic arena. Because of this it appears that the world is controlled anddominated by male energy – it’s a ‘man’s world’, but in truth it is not a worlddominated by the male, it is a world dominated by extremes of male and female. Iam not talking men and women here, I mean male and female energy which can beexpressed by both men or women. For instance, the Brotherhood manipulators likeHenry Kissinger never see a gun fired in anger. They are not out therephysically fighting (male energy) in the wars they engineer. They aremanipulating events from the shadows and behind our backs, a trait of thenegative female energy and symbolised by the story of the Trojan Horse. Thefemale energy is also the creative force and you can create negatively orpositively. The Brotherhood are highly malevolent, but very creative. For thisreason, in esoteric law and symbolism, the female energy (Diana, Semiramis,Isis, Barati, Britannia) is given different names for its different expressions.The Egyptians portrayed Isis in white in her positive mode and in black tosymbolise her negative aspect. In the same way we have the symbolism of Diana(positive female) and Hecate (negative female). They are simply differentsymbolic names for different manifestations of the female energy. The Satanistsof the Brotherhood work with the Hecate energy and that is why they worship thisdeity. They are actually worshipping the extreme negative female energy and itis for this reason that in Satanism the high priestess is considered asimportant as the priest, if not more so. At that Elite centre for Satanism inBelgium, the Castle of Darkness I mentioned in an earlier chapter, the topposition in the hierarchy is not known as the king, but the Queen Mother. So inthe Pont de L’Alma Tunnel the positive female energy (love, compassion,intuition), symbolised by Diana, was eliminated by the negative female energy(manipulation, ritual death), symbolised by Hecate and the crossroads.The death of Dodi Fayed was also crucial to the Satanic symbolism. Given thecircumstances of his death, it is quite a coincidence that his real name, EmadEl Din, is Arabic for ‘Pillar of Faith’. Dodi was a nickname he was given as atoddler by his family. This, too, is interesting. It is very close to Dido andin fact ‘Dido’ was the nickname he gave to Diana. Dido in Greek mythology wasthe legendary founder and queen of Carthage (an Aryan and reptilian peopleconnected to the Phoenicians) and she was the daughter of Belus, king of thePhoenician city of Tyre. When Dido’s husband was killed by her brother,Pygmalion, she fled with her followers to North Africa where she purchasedCarthage from the native ruler, Larbus. He later threatened Dido with war unlessshe married him, but instead she killed herself. But the most likely symbols forDodi Fayed’s death can be found in his birthplace, Egypt. The Brotherhood areobsessed with the symbolism in ancient Egypt of the Osiris-Horus-Isis trinity(Nimrod-Tammuz-Semiramis) which is expressed in Christianity as father, son, andholy ghost. Among many things, it symbolises the male and female energies comingtogether to create a third force, new life. To the Egyptians, and therefore theBrotherhood, the son of God was Horus. He was born to Isis after her husband,Osiris, had been murdered by Set. She gathered together 14 parts of hismutilated body, but she could not find the penis. So she created a penis andimpregnated herself to conceive Horus, the Sun God – Sun King, Horus was Osirisreborn. In Paris, part of this ritual was played out again. The car passed thegolden-tipped Egyptian obelisk, the penis of Osiris, in the Place de laConcorde, and inside the vehicle were Diana (another name for Isis) and theEgyptian, Dodi Fayed, representing Osiris. I have heard from many sources thatDiana was pregnant. Her foetus symbolised Horus, the Sun King. In ancient Egypt,they said that Osiris had to die before Horus could come in. This will soundamazing to most people, but if you study the unbelievable obsession these peoplehave with ritual and symbolism it makes perfect sense. Diana may not even haverealized she was pregnant. It could have been the foetus they were removing onthe operating table in Paris while they “battled to save her” for hours aftershe was clinically dead. I have heard suggestions that the cells from the foetusare being used to clone babies from this genetic mix. These will be ‘Sun gods’according to Brotherhood ritual. The cloning of humans has been possible for along time, as the cloning of sheep at the Roslyn Institute near Rosslyn Chapelin Scotland has clearly shown. The Brotherhood’s secret science is always far inadvance of anything allowed into the public domain and because of this thepublic find it impossible to believe what the Brotherhood can do with drugs andtechnology. So it is with their mind control techniques and I am sure that bothDiana and Dodi had been under the influence of mind manipulation over many weeksto ensure the ritual happened as required. For goodness sake, a stage hypnotistcan take over the mind of someone from the audience. Just think what is possiblefor those mind manipulators at the global cutting edge.The Pont de L’Alma is one of the most sacred places in the world to theBrotherhood and, as with the street plans in all their key cities, they madesure the site was full of appropriate symbolism: the bridge, the undergroundchamber, the crossroads and the name. Since my own spiritual awakening in 1990 Ihave been guided by my subconscious intuition to many Earth power centres. OftenI have not been aware of this at the time and only with hindsight have I seenhow, on a non-conscious level, I had been drawn to a major vortex point on themagnetic grid system and often to those of particular importance to theBrotherhood. In 1994 I was on holiday with my family near the Normandy coast inFrance and we decided to visit Paris. It was a long drive, but we had never seenthe city before. We drove to Versailles outside Paris and took the train fromthere to the station at the Eiffel Tower. It was a hot, humid, and sweaty day,and the area was packed with people and heavy with traffic. This combination wasso unpleasant that we decided not to stay very long before taking the train backto Versailles, but first we went for a short walk. We crossed the River Seine bya footbridge near the Eiffel Tower and walked a hundred yards or so alongsidethe river bank on the far side before finding a seat to rest. After sittingthere for about ten minutes we walked over the nearby road bridge and back tothe railway station to leave the city. We were in the place for little more thanan hour and that is all I had experienced of Paris until I went back to researchDiana’s death for this book.When I returned to Paris I had quite a shock because I found that seat againwhere we rested in 1994. It is on top of the Pont de L’Alma tunnel very close tothe 13th pillar where the car crashed! Also, near that seat above the mouth ofthe tunnel is a large depiction of a lighted torch (see picture section). This,of course, is the most obvious Brotherhood signature of them all and afterPresident Kennedy’s ritual killing, the Freemasons erected an obelisk in DealeyPlaza with a lighted torch at the top. Another flame was placed on his grave.The one on the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel stands on a black pentagram and there isn’ta more powerful Satanic symbol than that. It is supposed to be a ‘Flame ofLiberty’ (a copy of the flame held by the Statue of Liberty) to commemoratethose who died in the Second World War, but it’s location has, predictably,ensured that it has become a shrine to Diana. One newspaper report said that theFrench authorities were considering a permanent memorial to Diana at the Pont deL’Alma – a continuation of the 13th pillar above the ground! I can’t think ofanything more sick or more symbolic than that. The last I heard they planned toopen a vegetable garden to commemorate her death and they were going to pulldown a building to make way for it. The garden is an area of Paris that Diana isnever known to have visited and she had no recorded passion for growingvegetables. So what goes on? Well, first I bet you’ll find that the vegetablegarden will be on another ancient site of some kind, and most importantly suchan inadequate and bizarre memorial will ensure that the flame above the tunnelwill now remain the public shrine to Diana.The Flame of Liberty was placed on the tunnel entrance in 1987 and I am certainthe assassination of Diana at that spot was planned well before then. It isquite conceivable, given the Brotherhood’s long term planning and meticulousattention to ritual and symbolic detail, that it was planned for decades.Definitely before the sacrificial lamb was hooked into the Windsor web to marryCharles. It was Brotherhood symbolism which decided the location of theirwedding at St Paul’s Cathedral. St Paul’s, with its vast dome, was designed bySir Christopher Wren, the high Brotherhood initiate. It’s design is mirrored byboth the Congress Building in Washington DC and by the Pantheon in Paris.Brutus, the Trojan who became first king of the Britons in about 1,103BC, wasthe man who founded ‘New Troy’, known today as London. He was another whoworshipped the goddess Diana and he is reported to have erected a temple to heron what is now called Ludgate Hill on the site of a former stone circle.58[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681826] This is in the heart of the Cityof London financial district, that centre of Brotherhood control, and today onthis site of Diana worship you will find… St Paul’s Cathedral. In Paris, theNotre Dame (Our Lady) Cathedral is on an ancient site of Diana worship and theambulance carrying the princess’s body passed Notre Dame during that bizarrejourney to hospital. So Diana was married on an ancient sacred site to thegoddess Diana and she died on the site of an ancient sacrificial chamber of thegoddess Diana. She was also hunted and used by the Windsors to produce heirs andDiana was the ancient goddess of hunting, fertility and childbirth.When Prince Charles and Diana’s sisters went to Paris to escort her body back toLondon, the coffin was draped in the royal standard, the flag of the Windsorswhich is covered with the Sun symbol, the lion. Not the flag of the country,you’ll note, but the flag of the Windsors. Another strange coincidence happenedat the Hammersmith Mortuary in London. As her coffin arrived, the one carryingDodi was leaving and they apparently crossed at the entrance. What are thestatistical chances of that when both made such very different journeys fromParis? Dodi, we were told, had to be buried within 24 hours of his deathaccording to Muslim religious law and there was a mad rush by his father to meetthe deadline. There was no autopsy on his body, a quick external examination wasconsidered enough.At this point, Diana’s brother, Charles, Earl Spencer, then 33, came on thescene after flying back from his home in Cape Town, South Africa. When EarlSpencer, the Queen’s god-son, made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in1993, he chose a rather strange subject, Satanism On The Spencer’s AlthorpEstate In Northamptonshire. He acknowledged that it was going on, but he said hewas doing all he could to eradicate it. What a remarkable topic to introduce inyour first speech in the Houses of Parliament. The Brotherhood Mother Goddess,Arizona Wilder, reports seeing Earl Spencer and his father at some of thesacrificial rituals she conducted. It was Earl Spencer who announced that,despite her wishes, Diana’s body would not be interred in the family tomb at thelocal village church at Great Brington near the estate. Earl Spencer said hewanted to avoid swamping the village with sightseers and he had decided thatDiana would be buried on a man-made island in the centre of a lake on theAlthorp Estate. The lake is called The Oval and when looked at from above, theisland looks like a dot within a circle, a symbol of the Sun. The flame in acircle is on Kennedy’s grave. Also on the island, Spencer has placed theBrotherhood symbol of a burning flame and at one stage, Mohamed Al Fayed said hewas going to put an ‘eternal flame’ to Diana and Dodi on the roof of Harrods tomark the first anniversary of their deaths in August 1998.59[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1681951]Islands are very much part of the legends of the goddess Diana and she wassupposed to have been born on the island of Delos in the Aegean Sea. It is alsoknown as the Island of the Dead after Hecate, the patroness of the ‘infernalarts’, the negative aspect of the Diana goddess energy. Diana is another namefor Brito-Martis, the goddess of Crete which was colonised and developed by thePhoenicians who created the Minoan civilisation. Brito-Martis was actually aPhoenician goddess, according to Greek and Roman legend. She was the divine‘daughter’ of Phoinix (correctly spelt) the King of Phoenicia, and was armed,like Diana, with weapons for the chase. Legend says that Brito-Martis (Diana)sailed from Phoenicia to Argos in Southern Greece and onto Crete where she waspursued by her unwelcome admirer, Minos. She escaped by retreating to the seaand sailed to Aegina, an island in the Aegean where stands the temple of Artemisor Diana. Islands and Diana are very much connected in the legends. Earl Spencerput Diana’s grave among trees on the island and this is classic symbolismbecause the ancients used to worship the goddess Diana in the tree groves andthis was said to be her most sacred place. Sir James Frazer describes in hisbook, The Golden Bough, the Diana rite known as the King of the Wood at LakeNemi (again a lake is a big part of Diana legend). The Lady of the Lake is alsoBrotherhood symbolism. Frazer says that on the northern shore of Lake Nemi,under the cliffs on which the modern village of Nemi, near Aricia, is perched,was the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis, or Diana of the Wood,the goddess of hunting. Lake Nemi is the most celebrated shrine to the goddessDiana and here, says Frazer, there grew a tree around which the figure of apriest would be seen with a sword. A candidate for the priesthood in the cult ofDiana could only succeed by killing the present incumbent and he would only keepthe job until someone in turn killed him. The post carried the title of king –King of the Wood – and a long line of priest-kings who served Diana met aviolent end. So the goddess Diana is associated with islands and a lake and wasworshipped among the trees. And Earl Spencer puts his sister’s grave among thetrees on an island in a lake.Then there is the strange tale of the black swans. In June 1998, Earl Spencergave an interview for BBC Television in which he told of a dream he claimed tohave had between the crash in Paris and Diana’s funeral. In the dream, he said,he had been told to put four black swans on the lake around the island. When hecalled his estate manager the next morning and asked him where he would findfour black swans, the manager is supposed to have said: “You’ve heard then?”.“Heard what?”, Spencer claims to have asked. “We’ve been offered four blackswans”, the estate manager replied. Maybe this is true, but, in my view, thisstory has more to do with flying pigs than flying swans. Black swans areprofound occult symbols used in rituals and were the seal of the infamousSatanist, Catherine de Medici, who, Arizona Wilder says, was a previousincarnation of the Queen Mother. They appear most obviously in the ballet, SwanLake, when the black swan, symbolising the negative female energy, kills thewhite swan, symbolising the positive. In other words, Hecate kills Diana. OnJune 3rd 1997 when Mohammed Al Fayed invited Diana to holiday with him in theSouth of France they both attended a dinner following a charity performance of…Swan Lake. What better symbolism can you have of Swan Lake than black swans on alake, as at Althorp? A swan is a derogatory term in Druidism. Project Monarchslaves who rebel are told that they will be “Turned into swans” and Diana, ofcourse, rebelled against the Windsors. The number of swans also fits here.Monarch programming includes a term called The Four Gates of Heaven and fourcould also symbolise the four phases of the Moon. Earl Spencer has established a‘temple’ to Diana at the side of the lake. A number of the stately homes of theBritish aristocracy have temples or areas featuring the goddess Diana, amongthem Blenheim Palace home of the Marlboroughs and Chatsworth House, headquartersof the Cavendish’s, the Dukes of Devonshire, and both families are related tothe Spencers. Diana was carried in a lead-lined coffin and lead is the metalassociated in ritual magic with Saturn, possibly from where we get the nameSatan. The South African Sunday Times, owned by Illuminati frontman TonyO’Reilly, published a letter in 1999 which said I should be shot at dawn, mybody burned on a fire of my own books, the ashes put in a lead container andburied deep in the Earth. The colour associated with Saturn and Satanism isblack. Diana was also led to her death across the two key Brotherhood days ofSaturn-day and Sun-day. The 15th-century Italian philosopher-doctor fromFlorence, Marsilio Ficino, produced talismans for protection and the one forSaturn was engraved on pure lead. It was said to protect the wearer againstdeath by assassination and ambush and protected women in childbirth. On Diana’slead coffin during the funeral were lilies, the flower of Lilith, anotherversion of Hecate and a symbol of the bloodline. The lilies were chosen by EarlSpencer, Diana’s brother. The lily was also sacred to Astarte, another Dianadeity, and it was used to symbolise the impregnation of the virgin Mary. The‘blessed virgin’ Juno, ruler of August, was said to have conceived hersaviour-son, Mars, on a magic lily. The lily is symbolic of the reptilianbloodlines. In the year 656, the 10th Council of Toledo officially made the dayof Juno’s legendary conception of Mars into the Christian Festival of the Motherof God, or Lady Day, insisting that it commemorated Mary’s miraculous conceptionof Jesus with the aid of a lily.60 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1682141]In France the people knew Lady Day as Notre Dame de Mars. The symbolism of thelily with the pregnant goddess giving birth to the saviour-god (as in Isis andHorus) is fascinating, given the stories that Diana was pregnant at the time ofher death and the way I have connected this to the legend of Osiris, Isis andHorus.There have also been questions about whether Diana is even buried on the island.In the Summer of 1998, the Star magazine in the United States quoted an unnamed“senior source” at Buckingham Palace as saying she was secretly cremated andaccording to a report in the Los Angeles Times some people in the village ofGreat Brington also don’t believe she is buried on the island. I know thesereports are true from my own sources. One resident quoted by the LA Times saidthat the night her coffin was taken to Althorp for burial, the village had been‘invaded’ by the army, police and special forces units, and all the villagerswere hustled into their homes. She said that the crematorium at the church wasworking late into the night. Betty Andrews, the former cook and housekeeper atAlthorp, is quoted by Star magazine as saying: “There’s a strange feelingamongst the villagers that we may not be hearing the complete picture”.While researching this book I was introduced to Christine Fitzgerald, abrilliant and gifted healer, who was a close friend and confidant of Diana fornine years. Because of Christine’s understanding of the esoteric, Diana was ableto talk to her about matters she would not dare to share with anyone else forfear of being dubbed crazy. It is clear that Diana knew about the true nature ofthe royal family’s genetic history and the reptilian control. Her nicknames forthe Windsors were “the lizards” and “the reptiles” and she used to say in allseriousness: “They’re not human”. There is a very good reason for Diana usingthis description of the Windsors. As her deprogramming continued, ArizonaWilder, the Mother Goddess, remembered clearly a ritual she attended at ClarenceHouse, the Queen Mother’s home near to Buckingham Palace, in which Diana wasshown who the Windsors really are. It took place in the first seven days of July1981, she said, just before Diana and Charles were married on the 29th. Thisperiod is the last seven days of the cycle of the Oak Tree, according toesoteric law, Arizona said, and the ritual was called The Awakening of theBride. This is a ritual for all females of the 13 bloodlines (and others) whoare going to be in publicly high positions and marry reptilians to produce thenew generation of rulers. Arizona says that the Queen Mother, the Queen, PrincePhilip, Lady Fermoy, Diana’s father Earl Spencer, Prince Charles and CamillaParker-Bowles were all present when Diana was brought into the room. She waswearing a white gown and a drug had been administered by Lady Fermoy. Diana wastold that she should consider her union with Prince Charles as only a means toproduce heirs and nothing else, she said. Camilla Parker-Bowles was his consort,not her. (In the legends of the Goddess Diana, she had an ‘attendant’ calledCamilla, and was also connected to a character called Alphaide, pronouncedAl-fye-eeda!). Arizona said that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother thenshape-shifted into reptiles to show Diana who they really were. ‘Diana wasterrified, but quiet’, she said. Diana was told that if she ever revealed thetruth about them, she would be killed. (Remember the guy I mentioned who had acall from Diana in the March before she died asking for his advice on how toreveal information about the royals that would ‘shake the world’?) The QueenMother told Diana at the ritual that “all ears” would be listening to everythingshe said and “all eyes” would forever be watching her. This is the classic‘nowhere to run’ bind imposed on all mind controlled slaves. Does anyonebelieve, therefore, that they would allow Diana into the clutches of Mohammed AlFayed if he was not under their control? The ritual also involved the use of agolden penis (Osiris symbolism) which was used on Diana to signify the ‘openingof the womb’. Arizona says it was of reptilian shape and size and hadneedle-like protrusions designed to superficially puncture the walls of thevagina and cause bleeding. Diana was told that after this ritual, she wouldnever be “honoured” again by attending their rituals and she was not to askquestions about them. Now do people understand why Diana suffered from bulimiaand serious emotional problems from the time she married Charles?Diana told Christine Fitzgerald that the Queen Mother was the power behind theWindsors, along with Prince Philip. But Philip was subordinate in the hierarchyto the Queen Mother, Diana said. The Queen Mother is connected to a long list ofBrotherhood groups and societies and she is the head of the Inner Temple, theélite and highly secret society for the upper levels of the legal profession onthe ‘former’ Knights Templar land at Temple Bar in London. It was the QueenMother and her close friend, Diana’s grandmother, Ruth Lady Fermoy, whomanipulated Diana into the marriage with Prince Charles. This is why Diana wasgiven quarters at the Queen Mother’s home, Clarence House, in the weeks beforethe wedding and she left from there to marry Charles at St Paul’s Cathedral.“Diana used to tell me that the Queen Mother was evil”, Christine Fitzgeraldsaid, “She actually used that word, evil. She said she hated the Queen Motherand the Queen Mother hated her.” Most people in Britain will be astonished toread this because the Queen Mother’s propaganda has turned her into the nation’sfavourite grandmother. “Oh yes, the Queen Mum, such a lovely, gentle, kind oldlady.” But this woman is not what she is claimed to be. I can’t emphasise thatenough. During her time at Clarence House before the wedding, Diana says herselfthat she was being given drugs like the antidepressant, Valium, to treat herbulimia. And what else were they giving her? “They drugged her”, Christine said“I’m sure of it, they had her doped from the start.” Christine had manyconversations with Diana and she opened her heart about her nightmare life withthe Windsors. But Christine’s contacts through her work have given her access toother sources with inside knowledge of the British Royal Family, too. This wasthe first time she had talked publicly about her experiences with Diana and whatshe knows of the reptilian agenda. She told me:“The Queen Mother… now that’s a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother is alot older than people think. To be honest, the Royal Family hasn’t died for along time, they have just metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in adifferent way. They take pieces of flesh and rebuild the body from one littlebit. Because it’s lizard, because it’s cold-blooded, it’s much easier for themto do Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The different bodies are justdifferent electrical vibrations and they have got that secret, they’ve got thesecret of the micro-currents, it’s so micro, so specific, these radio waves thatactually create the bodies. These are the energies I work with when I’m healing.They know the vibration of life and because they are cold-blooded, they arereptiles, they have no wish to make the Earth the perfect harmony it could be,or to heal the Earth from the damage that’s been done. The Earth’s been attackedfor zeons by different extraterrestrials. It’s been like a football for so long.This place was a bus stop for many different aliens. All these aliens, theycould cope with everything, including the noxious gases. They’re landing all thetime and coming up from the bowels of the Earth. They looked like reptilesoriginally, but they look like us when they get out now through the electricalvibration, that life key I talked about. They can manifest how they want to. Allthe real knowledge has been taken out and shredded and put back in another way.The Queen Mother is “Chief Toad” of this part of Europe and they have peoplelike her in each continent. Most people, the hangers on, don’t know, you know,about the reptiles. They are just in awe of these people because they are sopowerful.“Balmoral is a very, very nasty place. That’s somewhere they want to digunderground. They will find reptile fossils, it goes back that far. Don’t thinkof people like the Queen Mother and Queen Victoria, as different people. Thinkof them as the same person which after a while has had to replace their coat.When the flesh dies, that energy, while it’s dying, will be immediately upsomeone else’s jacksy (backside). It’s very vampire, worse than vampire. Theyare not going to come to you with hooked teeth and suck you’re blood. Fear istheir food, they can actually take fear and manifest it into a tangible thing.The key is the vibrational current. At that vibrational current, they canmanifest anything from anything. Its like a holographic image. We are allminerals and water vibrating. This is all an illusion we are living in. That’sthe secret. You know when the monarchy’s fallen, it’s not the end of it. Theywill manifest in another form. The reptiles have never been defeated and this isthe closest they have come to it. The reason they are so threatened today isbecause the Earth is in such trouble and the mental power of people isreturning. This is their most frightening time, but this is not going to killthem. There are long centuries before it’s over yet. The difference this time isthat it’ll be more difficult for them and they are going to have to settle forless and the Earth people are going to get more. But even though these reptilianones are fuckers, they are sad, pathetic beasts really, while humanity isgalloping towards light. They’re just pathetic lumps of nastiness who aren’tgoing to win. I can’t talk about this everywhere because they would just go‘Christine, get a white coat, put it on backwards, get out’. But I want an endto the bullshit.”I was astonished to hear someone else talking about these subjects, which I knewfrom my own research to be true. She was not aware when she told me this of myown research into reptilians. Christine Fitzgerald, thanks to her insidercontacts and her knowledge of metaphysics, had been able to grasp the BiggestSecret: that reptiles on another dimension are controlling the world by workingthrough physical bodies which look human. And also that the Windsors are one ofthese reptilian bloodlines. Christine also knew about the reptile Satanicrituals, the sexual rites and the widespread sacrifice of children. She said itis the pure essence of the pre-pubescent the reptiles want. “If you looked atwhere all the castles are built and where there are a lot of street children inthe Third World, they’re galloping it at the moment. They’re pulling the kids inen masse now.” She said the reptiles want the children’s life essence becausethey can’t continue to manifest without that pure energy. “The contaminatedessence of us adults is not worth anything to them”, she said. “All the rituals,the knives, and sodomy, its that easy for these people to snatch a piece of yoursoul.” Christine also spoke about the sex rituals and orgies involving theWindsors. The very word orgy comes from the Greek, orgia, meaning ‘secretworship’ and relates to the sexual rites of the ancient mystery religions.Christine said:“There used to be an elect circle who took part in ritual orgies at BuckinghamPalace. This was told to me by one of the participants. They were all couples.The lights used to go out at a certain time and they all swapped round and didtheir things. You know about the butler ringing the bell at six o’clock in themorning so that everyone goes back to their bed? These people are nasty piecesof work, sweetheart, these people are nasty. Nothing you can think of can everbe as nasty as they really are. Diana used to say that if the world knew whatthey were really like, they wouldn’t want them, but I knew that. My chin was onthe couch now, hearing about all these orgies at the palace. Just the laugh thatthese serious people who are going on like butter wouldn’t melt up their jacksyand they are carrying on like that. But the sex thing is a big part of theirrituals because it’s kundalini energy, see, which is the core, our generator.The orgies stopped because one of the couples died and they had an odd numberand they didn’t want to bring in anyone else. So even that was ritual.Everything about them is ritual… all that heraldry, all that pomp and ceremony.Negative energy gets drawn to negative energy.”Many of the Queen’s Ladies in Waiting have told Christine Fitzgerald aboutPrince Philip and his affairs. “The royal family has got lots of black babiesall over the world”, she says. The recovering mind-slave Brice Taylor tells inher book, Thanks For The Memories, how she was forced to have sex with Philipand Charles. It is not without reason that the former British Intelligenceofficer, Peter Wright, said in his controversial book, Spycatcher, that “Thepalace had enjoyed several centuries of scandal burying.” Christine said thatanother controversial book, The Royals, by the American author Kitty Kelly wastrue, but “She’s left out a lot of stuff, she’s been quite kind”. She’s notkidding as you will soon appreciate. Christine told me about other members ofthe royal clan including Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mountbatten, anotherSatanist. She said: “Lord Mountbatten was a big shit, too. It was him who fuckedup Charles and got him on the nasty road.” So this is the family which hooked anunsuspecting 19-year-old and used her, in Diana’s words, as a “brood mare” toproduce Windsor heirs with Spencer genes. But it was more than that. Much more.Only a few weeks before this book went to press, and months after Christine gaveme her information in England, I was contacted by a friend in the United Stateswho was deprogramming a very high level mind controlled slave from ProjectMonarch. He believes her to be the highest ranked woman in the Satanic hierarchyin the United States and she was one of only three Mother Goddesses in theworld. This is Arizona Wilder, formerly Jennifer Greene. At the time my friendand Arizona had no idea what Christine Fitzgerald had said. Arizona had beenprogrammed and trained since childhood to become a Mother Goddess who conductedSatanic rituals at the highest levels of the Brotherhood all over the world. Shedescribed to my friend the inside of many secret and underground facilities thathe has personally seen. What she described was accurate every time. He alsochecked her story with other contacts and the truth of her memories wascontinually confirmed. What she told my friend, and later told me on audio andvideo tape, supports the information supplied by other slaves and by ChristineFitzgerald about the Windsors and their true nature. Arizona said that sheofficiated at Satanic rituals at Glamis Castle in Tayside, Scotland, thechildhood home of the Queen Mother, who still owns the property, and also atBalmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence. The Brotherhood obsession withScotland, she said, was because there are many entrances there into theinner-Earth where the physical reptilians live. Glamis Castle is built on thesite of an 11th century royal hunting lodge and the present building dates fromaround 1687. It is mentioned in the ‘Shakespeare’ story of Macbeth and there aremany stories of a secret room or place at Glamis. Arizona said that the Queen,Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Anne are present at the rituals andso is Charles’ girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles. Doesn’t it all now start tomake sense?She said that during the sacrificial rituals the Queen wears a cloak of goldfabric inlaid with rubies and black onyx. The Queen and Charles have their ownritual goblets, inlaid with precious stones signifying theirIlluminati-Brotherhood rank. The Mother Goddess says that the Queen makes cruelremarks about lesser initiates, but is afraid of the man code-named ‘Pindar’(the Marquis de Libeaux) who is higher than her in the Satanic hierarchy. Thisalso supports a claim made to me by another recovering slave who said she hadseen the Queen physically beaten by someone above her in Satanic rank. Pindar,apparently, bears a resemblance to Prince Charles and Arizona says that Pindaris Charles’ real father. She said that the sacrificial victims used in therituals at Glamis Castle are mostly under five years of age and the ceremoniesare guarded by members of Scotland’s Black Watch. She also confirmed that LordMountbatten was a paedophile and that the Windsors are reptilians in human form.Her interview with me was taped, as were the ones with Christine Fitzgerald, andcopies are now at various addresses. The video interview with Arizona isavailable and details are at the back of the book. Arizona says that Dianadefinitely knew that the Windsors were shape-shifting reptilians and Diana'scomments to Christine Fitzgerald support this. Apparently, reptilians have beenseen to shape-shift during sleep. Here is a summary of just some of what Arizonasaid about the royal family: * The Queen Mother: She’s cold, cold, cold, a nasty person. None of her cohorts even trusted her. They have named an alter (mind control programme) after her. They call it the Black Queen. I have seen her sacrifice people. I remember her pushing a knife into someone’s rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed. One was 13 and the other 18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears to be a frail old woman. When she shape-shifts into a reptilian she becomes very tall and strong. Some of them are so strong they can rip out a heart and they all grow by several feet when they shape-shift.” (Exactly what the lady who saw Edward Heath said, among many others.) * The Queen: “I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood. One time she got so excited with blood lust that she didn’t cut the victim’s throat from left to right in the normal ritual, she just went crazy, stabbing and ripping at the flesh after she’d shape-shifted into a reptilian. When she shape-shifts she has a long reptile face, almost like a beak, and she’s an off-white colour. The Queen Mother looks basically the same, but there are differences. (This description fits many depictions of the gods and ‘bird gods’ of ancient Egypt and elsewhere.) She also has like bumps on her head and her eyes are very frightening. She’s very aggressive.” * Prince Charles: “I’ve seen him shape-shift into a reptilian and do all the things the Queen does. I have seen him sacrifice children. There is a lot of rivalry between them for who gets to eat what part of the body and who gets to absorb the victim’s last breath and steal their soul. I have also seen Andrew participate and I have seen Prince Philip and Charles’ sister (Anne) at the rituals, but they didn’t participate when I was there. When Andrew shape-shifts, he looks more like one of the lizards. The royals are some of the worst, OK, as far as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice, and eating the flesh, they’re some of the worst of all of them. They don’t care who sees them at the rituals, they are what they are, they show it outright. They don’t care if you see it. Who are you going to tell, who is going to believe you? They feel that it is their birth-right and they love it. They love it.” * Given the evidence I have presented in this chapter about the background toDiana’s murder, I was not surprised to hear this Mother Goddess recall thefollowing about Mohamed Al Fayed:“I saw Mohammed Al Fayed at a ritual at the Mothers of Darkness castle inBelgium in the 1980s. The Queen and the Queen Mother were also there. The QueenMother was talking to him and he was looking around as if he didn’t believe thissort of thing went on. It was on December 24th at the ritual of the old king andthe new king. They didn’t let him in to see the worst of it. It was kind oflike, ‘let’s introduce him into this’. But he would have seen a baby being bornand introduced as the new king and the sacrifice of an old man. The Queen Motherwas there, the Queen, Pindar, Rothschilds, a lot of people I don’t know and aguy named Tony Blair. He was being groomed because my understanding of it wasthat people are picked out and groomed for certain positions. And to beconsidered for those positions you have to accept the reality and the necessityand the sovereignty of the Illuminati, and that the reptilians run the show.Tony Blair’s attitude was like ‘I belong here’. Dodi Fayed’s father seemedbothered by it, but not Tony Blair. I remember seeing him talking to the royalsabout something. I have seen Blair, Al Fayed and the Royal Family at rituals atBalmoral as well.”Once you know this astonishing background, the why, who and how of Diana’smurder become crystal clear. They were all in it together and still are. Diana’smurder had been planned for a long time, probably from birth, and it was in the1980s, around the time Al Fayed was at the Mother of Darkness castle with theroyal family and Tony Blair, that the flaming torch symbol was placed on top ofthe Pont de L’Alma tunnel. Arizona said that Diana was a product of the multiplepersonality disorder programme, which she said would have started before she wasfive. She said Diana was also three months pregnant when she died. Diana wouldprobably not have known this, she said, because the techniques the Brotherhooduse often mean that the women continue to menstruate for some months before theyare officially confirmed to be pregnant. Arizona said that when she, herself,was artificially impregnated in a mind controlled state with Pindar’s sperm, shemenstruated for three months before she was told by a doctor that she was morethan three months pregnant. It could have been Pindar’s child and not DodiFayed’s, Arizona suggested. “That is a really powerful sacrifice” she said, “tosacrifice a pregnant woman”. If Diana was, as appears highly likely, a productof the mind control programme, those who plotted her murder could have ensuredall that they required to play out their ritual to perfection. She would haveaccepted the invitation from Al Fayed at the right time, fallen for Dodi Fayed,agreed to go to Paris for the night and so on. She could also have been, likeArizona, impregnated artificially and have no recollection of it. Arizona saysthat she knows that Diana was impregnated with Pindar’s sperm in this way toconceive her son William, the blond-haired, blue-eyed baby born on the summersolstice. And she is in no doubt that Diana was a ‘multiple’. As she said:“The things that she did with her eyes, like the eye rolling, is very, verycommon in multiples. Sometimes she’d be very shy and then suddenly she’sblossoming and she’s really social. These are the different alters (programmes)coming out, someone’s shy, someone’s not shy, someone’s angry, someone’s notangry. Then there was the weight gain and the weight loss. The bulimia and thecutting herself are all signs of a multiple. Some are told that if you feel badabout yourself or you remember something, cut yourself. To me it was realobvious with Diana. Someone with this stuff just doesn’t announce to the worldthat something’s wrong, They spend their lives trying to hide it. ‘I was outgrocery shopping’, or ‘I was out clothes shopping’, ‘I was taking a walk’,whatever, but you weren’t.”The recovering mind-slave Brice Taylor confirms that Diana was a ‘multiple’ inher book, Thanks For The Memories, and she says that William and Harry are also.I think Dodi was another, thus making it child’s play to make he and Diana ‘fallin love’. The symbolism of Osiris, Isis and Horus, in the Pont de L’Alma tunnelthat night was also confirmed by Arizona. “Diana was Isis, Dodi Fayed wasOsiris, and the child was Horus. I don’t think it symbolised the birth of achild so much as the birth of an age – the Age of Horus which begins by the year2,000. This means the New World Order, the Age of Horus, the terrible child.”She said that the foetus would have been divided among certain high rankingleaders of the Brotherhood/ Illuminati and consumed in ritual. She said thatfrom her long experience of the rituals, she was sure that parts of Diana’s bodywould have been consumed also. Again I ask, is her body even on the island atAlthorp Park? It makes you wonder what Tony Blair and the Royals were doing whenthey came together at Balmoral immediately after Diana’s death. Another part ofthe ritual was that Diana was blond-haired and blue-eyed. Cathy O’Brien is thesame, so is Arizona although she had dyed her hair to break that spell when Imet her. She said that even when the Elite sacrifice cats they are blond-hairedand blue-eyed. There is something about that genetic structure which isfundamental to them and this is the blood they most desire. At least most of theMonarch slaves have blond hair and blue eyes. “There were no blue eyes on thisplanet until the extraterrestrials came”, Arizona said.Diana told Christine Fitzgerald in 1989 that they were going to kill her: “Itsounded outlandish at the time”, Christine said, “because she had the boys andthey were little and I thought, no, they need her to bring the boys up.” Butthere were to be many indications that Diana was indeed in danger from theWindsors and the Brotherhood in general. In the late 1980s with her marriagenothing more than a public show, Diana was having a relationship with herpersonal detective, Barry Mannakee, but he died in a motorcycle ‘accident’ in1988. By 1990, with the Gulf War threatening, Diana was having a relationshipwith Captain James Hewitt. One day, about this time, she went rushing intoChristine’s healing centre in London in a terrible state. Christine remembers:“She was crying hysterically and I said ‘What’s the matter?’ You know it wasdog’s died stuff, bottom lip out, full sob. She came galloping through the door.I gave her rescue remedy, clutched her, hugged her, calmed her down, and saidnow tell me what’s going on. ‘I can’t believe it, I can’t believe it, theykilled him, they killed him’ she sobbed. I said: ‘Who did they kill?’ She toldme about her affair with the detective (Barry Mannakee) and how he wasdecapitated on a motorbike and how she thought it was a terrible accident. Butnow she knows the Royal Family killed him because Prince Charles’ seniordetective had just told her that if she didn’t cool it with Hewitt, the samewould happen to him. He told her she should not think that she wasindispensable, either.”Officially, Barry Mannakee died in a ‘road crash’. How dangerous the roads seemto be if the royals don’t like you. Christine said that Diana was very much inlove with Mannakee and she had visited his grave regularly. Diana had,apparently, been unaware of his death at the time until she was being drivenwith Prince Charles to the airport to fly to the Cannes Film Festival. He waiteduntil she was about to get out of the car in front of waiting photographers andhe said: “Oh, by the way, I got word from the Protection Unit yesterday thatpoor Barry Mannakee was killed. Some sort of motorcycle accident. Terribleshame, isn’t it?” Diana burst into tears, but Charles said sarcastically: “Let’sgo darling, your press awaits you.”61[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1682283] I would emphasise again that theconfirmation that Mannakee was murdered, and the personal threat to Diana, camefrom Prince Charles’ senior detective, according to the Princess. Would he bemaking statements and threats to her like that without the approval of PrinceCharles? Of course not. In 1998 in the Independent Television documentary, Diana– Secrets Of The Crash, James Hewitt said that he too had been warned to stopseeing Diana or the consequences would not be pleasant. He said:“The telephone calls were anonymous, but left me in no doubt that they knew whatthe situation was. They were threatening. They said it was not conducive to myhealth to continue the relationship.”He said that other warnings came from Diana’s personal police protectionofficers, the Royal Household, and a member of the Royal Family, whom he wouldnot name:“The (member of the Royal Family) said your relationship is known about. It isnot supported, we cannot be responsible for your safety and security, andsuggest that you curtail it forthwith.”James Hewitt was further quoted in the London Times about these threats and hiscomments supported completely the story Diana had told Christine Fitzgerald.Hewitt said that his clearest warning came when he was told that he would sufferthe same fate as Barry Mannakee.62 [../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1682430]Does anyone still believe that the Windsors and their networks were not involvedin the murder of Princess Diana? Or that they had prior knowledge and played anactive role in the decision to assassinate the mother of William and Harry?According to reports in the United States, Susan Barrantes, the mother of Sarah‘Fergie’ Ferguson, had been telling friends that she thought Diana had beenmurdered in the weeks before she was decapitated in a mysterious car crash inArgentina on September 19th 1998.63[../Text/index_split_047.html#filepos1682552] Confidential mail for Diana wasdelivered to Christine Fitzgerald and this included packages from a formermember of the élite SAS who was concerned for Diana’s safety. He was warning herof what was going on behind her back.” Half of MI6 were on Diana’s side too youknow”, Christine said. One day a client, who had involvement with the securityagencies, saw some of these packages being delivered. Christine described whatfollowed:“She said I’m really worried for you, you don’t know what you’re gettinginvolved in here. Diana’s basically mad, she’ll drop you in it, she will hangyou out to dry, you’ll end up dead, your kids will end up dead, your cats, yourbusiness will be ruined. I couldn’t believe how she was carrying on. She was sofull of hate. Diana came in the next day and I gave her the mail. I said noteveryone who bows to you has your best interests at heart. I told her whathappened and she went purple with rage. When she died, everybody came in andsaid ‘They bumped her off didn’t they?’ But that client was the only one who wasoutraged at the suggestion. I was checked out by MI6, my phones were tapped, myhouse was burgled, the royal family kept a big check on me while I was dealingwith Diana.”Christine and her contacts have no doubt about what happened in Paris: “She wasbumped off, she was left to die at the roadside. Those responsible were abovethe élite of the army”, she said. “It was not the ‘secret squirrels’ (BritishIntelligence)”, she understands, “it was above that”. She said that “Mohamed AlFayed ‘in his tortured little sense’ wants to be part of the reptilian powerbecause ‘he likes all that’.” Christine believes that Diana’s romance with Dodiwas engineered. She said:“Diana fell in love quite easily and he’s a master of the smile. She wasunfortunate in her love affairs because she rescued others in her own distress.So the men she went for were all emotional cripples because she was a healer,too. Most people who went with Diana used her and I think Dodi did also. Hewould have used her for his ego, the contacts, and his dad. The Royal Familykilled her for her light energy, especially when she was pregnant. I don’tbelieve she was as badly injured as they say. If they checked her body theywould see that the scar the surgeons made starts at her pubis and goes right upto her throat. They’ve even taken her thymus gland, the way we make interstellarcommunication. I know from the best sources that she was pregnant and they tookthe baby. Pieces of that foetus will have been delivered everywhere. They canmake babies from the cells. Parts of her body will have been used in theirrituals as well. Diana was always having Kensington Palace swept for bugs, butthey had Dodi bugged and they knew exactly what was going on. This was not thefirst time she thought she was pregnant and this nearly happened before, but shewasn’t pregnant. That was with Hewitt.”Christine Fitzgerald shared the most intimate details of Diana’s life and knewher in ways, and at levels, that very few others did. The incredible revelationsof the Windsors’ treatment of Diana over so many years, the threats made to herby Prince Charles’ personal detective, the ritual sacrifices and theconfirmation that they were responsible for the murder of Barry Mannakee, cannotbe allowed to pass by. There must be a campaign to press the Windsors to facethese matters and for Al Fayed, Trevor Rees-Jones, Earl Spencer, and the othersI have named, to answer the questions that have to be addressed. Power must bestripped from the Windsors, their royal dynasty dismantled, and their crimesagainst humanity publicly exposed. More than that, however, those in thepolitical, security, and medical professions, who are also involved, must beequally exposed. The Royal Family, Earl Spencer, and the British Prime Minister,Tony Blair, have all dismissed claims that Diana was murdered and called forsuch suggestions to cease ‘for the sake of the boys’. The questions must not beallowed to be ignored or another Brotherhood assassination will have beenachieved while those responsible go free. Earl Spencer went to the extent ofissuing a statement on behalf of the Spencer family in February 1998 in which heasked: “Is there any good in all this speculation? I ask that because there isclearly a lot of harm in it. All we, her family, ask is that Diana’s memory berespected, and that sensational speculation be left out of the public arena,where it undermines our aims to come to terms with her loss”. When you see theevidence presented in this chapter while people like Earl Spencer and Tony Blairsay there is no evidence of a conspiracy, what does that make you think? IfDiana had been your sister would you not be determined to find out whathappened? If you were Prime Minister when such a famous and much loved Princesshad been killed, would you not insist that the truth be established? So whydon’t they? Diana’s relationship with her brother was less than harmonious tosay the least. When you know the background, Earl Spencer’s famous speech at herfuneral can be seen as a diatribe of hypocrisy. So was his bitter condemnationof the media, in a statement after her death outside his home in Cape Town, astatement which, like Al Fayed’s, fueled the belief that the paparazzi were toblame for the crash. Christine Fitzgerald said of him:“Charles Spencer is a shit, major shit. He’s quite a spiteful little shit, too.When Diana was going through the trauma and really needed a new home, he said toher: ‘You’re not bringing your shit down to me and mine.’ He wouldn’t even giveher one of the houses. He’s not a powerful man at all. He knows he’s sniffingaround something dangerous and powerful and so he’s attracted to it. Satanismgoes on on the Spencer estate. Diana knew about it.”Diana had a profound affect on millions of people as we saw after her death andthey did not know the half of what she had to suffer after the Windsors sanktheir fangs. In many ways Diana was a mirror of Marilyn Monroe, used by theestablishment and then cast aside and murdered. Marilyn had affairs withPresident Kennedy and, it seems, his brother, Bobby, and when she becamedangerous and surplus to requirements she was killed because of what she knew.In another of those remarkable examples of synchronicity there are many‘coincidences’ that connect her life and Diana’s. They were both born on thefirst of the month and died at the age of 36 in August. They both married on the29th of the month to men twelve years older. Marilyn called herself the Queen ofDiamonds and Diana the Queen of Hearts. And both were the subject of the EltonJohn song, Candle In The Wind, which he sang at Diana’s funeral. Since ChristineFitzgerald first spoke to me the threat to destroy her business has beenimplemented. Suddenly the phone stopped ringing and when I met her again she wasseeing as many clients in a week as she had been in a day. This is unexplainablewhen you consider she is one of Britain’s most gifted and effective healersworking in the centre of London. Unexplainable, that is, unless you know thestory. But she told me she is determined the truth shall be known, whatever theauthorities seek to do to her: “I don’t want a war, I just want an end to thebullshit”, as she puts it. Looking back on Diana’s life and their conversationstogether, she says:“Poor cow, she was in a house where no-one gave a damn and it’s a terrible stateof affairs. She was all alone in a nest of vipers. I used to just patch her up.She just found me and just came to me. I made her wait for a fortnight until Ichecked it out. They used to say that I was giving her anger therapy. I didn’t.I used to just listen to her, take it all in, and think Jesus Christ! But Ididn’t think they would kill her. I can’t believe that this information is soclose to home and yet they are still managing to keep it at bay. My room is thetruth room and its a real place of safety and I don’t judge anyone on theirshit, and that’s why I haven’t spoken about any of this in the past. She was asscrewed up as anyone, you know, and if you are going to tell the truth, you haveto tell the whole truth. She wasn’t crazy, she was mentally and physicallyabused, I feel, from a little girl. Her father was a nasty piece of work and herstepmother (Raine), too.“The Royal Family were very afraid. She would have taken the public away fromthem, she would have taken the world from them gradually. They recognised herworth and fed off her in a psychic vampire way for a long time. All she wantedwas to get married and have children you know, bless her little heart. Shewanted to live out what she had never had. The world would have come to rightswith Diana because, as fucked up as she was, she was a light being and wherevershe went she manifested love. It was amazing. The sad thing was that she didn’tknow she was doing that and she needed proof of her worth and she was looking inthe wrong quarters for that. But when she tried to break away, we went out anddid normal things. She did kung fu with my husband for five years. She wanted tobe normal, to link arms and walk down the street. She knew where her heart lay.She really and truly did amazing things.”Diana said she could not believe how cold the Windsors were and the public had agraphic example of this in the days after her death. They stayed out of sight atBalmoral in Scotland while the people mourned Diana in their tens of millionswith an unprecedented explosion of grief. Only pressure from the public throughthe media forced the Queen, kicking and screaming, to make a cold, emotionlessand pathetic ‘tribute’ to Diana on television the night before the funeral. Coldis a word constantly used about the Queen, Philip, and Charles, and that’s themental and emotional profile of the Brotherhood and its networks. Bill Coopersaid that the initiates that he met in his work for US Naval Intelligence had“No conscience, no morals, no regrets, no feelings, no emotion”. This isprecisely the same character profile as the Windsors and, according to all thepeople I have met who have encountered them, the character profile of thereptilians of the lower fourth dimension. There is a reason for that, of course.The people have been hoodwinked for thousands of years. Hoodwinked about theirhistory, hoodwinked about who they really are and the true nature of life.Hoodwinked about the true background and Agenda of those they have allowed torule them. How apt, therefore, that this word should also derive fromFreemasonry. Dr. Albert MacKey, the 33rd degree Freemason and foremost Freemasonhistorian of the 19th century, defined the term ‘hoodwinked’ in hisEncyclopaedia of Freemasonry as: A symbol of secrecy, silence and darkness, inwhich the mysteries of our art should be preserved from the unhallowed gaze ofthe profane.The human race has indeed been hoodwinked."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1467201] The Top 13 IlluminatiBloodlines, p 89.2 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1467395] Ibid, p 90.3 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1467841] Ibid.4 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1468042] Ibid.5 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1468333] Ibid.6 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1468487] Ibid, p 91-2.7 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1468947] Ibid, p 89.8 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1469484] Ibid.9 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1469868] Secret And Suppressed, p 66.10 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1470028] Ibid.11 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1470337] Ibid, p 68.12 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1471991] The Top 13 IlluminatiBloodlines, p 94.13 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1473654] Secret And Suppressed, p 80.14 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1474077] The Top 13 IlluminatiBloodlines, p 99.15 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1475843] Ibid, p 102.16 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1479378] Secret And Suppressed, pp 19,65, 85.17 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1487510] Ibid, p 66.18 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1487759] Ibid.19 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1489656] Ibid, p 6520 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1490937] Ibid, p 69.21 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1495588] Andrew Morton, Diana, Her TrueStory (Michael O'Mara Books, London, 1992, republished as Diana: Her True StoryIn Her Own Words, 1997).22 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1499555] Ibid.23 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1499955] Ibid.24 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1501116] The London Daily Mail,Thursday, August 27th 1998.25 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1501351] Ibid.26 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1502598] Diana: Her True Story.27 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1503392] Ibid.28 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1505875] Ibid.29 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1510595] Private Eye magazine, No 956,Friday, August 7th 1998, p 5.30 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1512028] Tom Bower, Fayed, TheUnauthorised Biography (Macmillan, London, 1998).31 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1512320] Ibid, p 22.32 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1513323] The London Daily Mail, Friday,June 26th 1998.33 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1514361] Simon Reagan, Who Killed Diana?(a Scallywag publication, Amsterdam, 1998), p 57.34 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1515349] Ibid, p 62.35 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1518459] The News Of The World, Sunday,January 18th 1998, pp 18, 19.36 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1519433] Peter Hounam and Derek McAdam,Who Killed Diana?, p 17.37 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1523846] Dispatches, Channel Four, June1998.38 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1524412] Ibid.39 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1524906] Ibid.40 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1526522] Fayed, The UnauthorisedBiography, p 425.41 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1526966] Ibid, p 420.42 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1530734] Ibid, p 421.43 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1532784] Peter Hounam and Derek McAdam,Who Killed Diana?, p 64.44 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1535945] Ibid, pp 73, 74.45 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1537526] Jim Marrs, Crossfire: The PlotThat Killed Kennedy (Carrol and Graf Publishers, New York, 1989), p 382.46 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1541224] Dispatches.47 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1553605] Diana - Secrets Of The Crash,ITV, 1998.48 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1557399] \"Diana, the Unsolved Mystery”,News Of The World News Special, January 18th 1998.49 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1562250] The information about DavidSands death comes from the Tony Collins book, Open Verdict, an account of 25mysterious deaths in the defence industry (Sphere Books, London, 1990).50 [../Text/index_split_046.html#filepos1571186] Sir Peter Horsley, Sounds FromAnother Room (Leo Cooper, England, 1997).

This has been going on for thousands of years and it is soimportant to understand this if we are going to break free from reptiliancontrol – as we are.Everything that exists is an energy field, a unique vibrational pattern ofenergy created by thought and emotion. All that exists is the same energy, butthese infinite patterns create infinite forms, just as water can manifest asliquid, clouds, steam and ice. They look and feel very different, but they arestill water in different forms. Some energy patterns manifest as the human body,others the human mind, still others the birds, trees, insects, water, sky andair. At the level of pure energy everything is connected to everything else.There is no us and them, only we and ultimately ‘I’. Potentially we have theability to access all other energy and, as energy and consciousness are thesame, the ability to access all consciousness, the infinite mind we call ‘God’.This ‘God’ is not apart from us, it is us and we are it. We are an aspect of theinfinite mind – as are the reptilians and all that exists – and therefore wehave the potential to tap into all of the infinite mind because, at our highestexpression, that is what we all are. Everything. We are like droplets in aninfinite ocean, individual to an extent, but together we make the whole, the sumtotal of droplets. Without the droplets there can be no ocean. The question,however, is this: How much of this ocean are we connecting with? If it is a tinyfraction you will live in a cocoon, an egg shell as I call it, delinked fromyour infinite potential for knowledge, love, understanding and wisdom (seeFigure 54). You will live a predictable life dominated by worry and fear andbelieve that you are ordinary and powerless to control your own destiny. If youopen your mind and open your heart and break out of that cocoon you connect withmore and more of infinity and, in doing so, you understand that you are morethan a physical body experiencing one meaningless lifetime. You are infiniteconsciousness experiencing this world as part of your eternal journey ofevolution through experience (see Figure 55). You are everything and you havethe potential to know everything and do everything.Now which one of those two states of being is more easy to control? Of coursethe answer is obvious and this explains so much about the world we have seenthroughout known human history. This is why the knowledge of who we really arehas been systematically destroyed in the public arena. Humans who understandtheir true nature, power and worth would be impossible to manipulate in the wayswe have seen. Only by delinking humanity from this knowledge has it beenpossible to orchestrate the reptilian-Brotherhood Agenda over thousands ofyears. The creation of religion and official ‘science’ has been fundamental tothat and, as we have seen, the same secret society streams were responsible forestablishing both. The individualisation of the concept of ‘God’ into a man, aphysical form, has suppressed the understanding that everything is God. So muchso that to say you are God is to invite enormous ridicule or condemnation, as Iknow myself when I spoke very publicly of such things in Britain in the early1990s. It has become a blasphemy to say what you are, what we all are. For thosewho will not buy a religion, we have this-world-is-all-there is science whichdenies the very existence of the infinity and eternal nature of life. TheBrotherhood plan has been to so programme and manipulate humanity’s perceptionof itself and Creation that we disconnect from our multidimensional infinity andoperate on a tiny fraction of our potential. But the reptilians are also anexpression of the Infinite and they are offering us an experience that we canuse to evolve, just as those challenging the reptilian control are offering theman experience. Humans are learning what happens when they give their power awayand this reptilian group are about to learn the consequences of abusing power.It is a game in the end, a game called evolution, learning to master our mindand emotions. What I have been describing in this book is an evolutionaryexperience for all parties concerned. We all make decisions and choices and facethe consequences of them. Those consequences are what we are experiencing now.If we make new choices, we will create different consequences. We are in controlof our destiny, and people are waking up to that.[../Images/00004.jpg]Figure 54: Imprisonment.[../Images/00003.jpg]Figure 55: Freedom.[../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 56: The reptilians have imprisoned so much of human consciousness withinthe lower fourth dimensional prison of fear, guilt, and frustration. Only byopening our hearts and minds can we escape and reconnect with our infinite self.Love is the answer.The reptilians manipulate from the lower fourth dimension, the so-called lowerastral frequency range. To control this planet they have to keep the mass ofhumanity at or below that level and disconnect them from anything higher (seeFigure 56). When this is understood, what has happened in the world and is stillhappening, again makes perfect sense. Crucial to maintaining the human psyche indisconnected ignorance is the manipulation of low vibrational emotion, fear,guilt, resentment, dislike of self and condemnation of others which, in the end,are all expressions of fear. These are the very emotions which resonate to thefrequency range of the lower fourth dimension and once we succumb to dominationby these emotions we succumb to the control of the reptilian consciousness.Notice that I said domination. Feeling these emotions as part of the lifeexperience is fine. This is important in our evolution to greater understandingand wisdom. It is when these emotions control you that the whole focus of yourpsyche becomes plugged into the lower fourth dimension to such an extent thatthe reptilian consciousness can connect and infiltrate your thought patterns. Sothe Brotherhood use horrific Satanic rituals and sacrifice to synchronise theirinitiates with the reptilian wavelengths. They also seek to stimulate thecharacter traits of our R-complex, the reptilian part of our brain, whichmanifest as aggression, ritualism, a desire for hierarchical structure, and soon.What I am suggesting here about the nature of life is not some theory. It can beproved. Scientists and researchers in the United States have shown that theemotion of fear resonates a low vibrational pattern, a long wavelength, whilethe emotion we call love resonates a high vibrational pattern, a shortwavelength. This is extremely significant for this reason, as the author,researcher and archaeologist Gregg Braden shows in his video, Awakening To ZeroPoint, 1 [../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos1756838] the genetic material ofthe human body is a highly sophisticated transmitter and receiver offrequencies. Experiments have shown that when you place a piece of DNA, thebody’s genetic blueprint, in a tube of electrons, the electrons form themselvestogether in the pattern of the DNA. When you remove the DNA, the electrons stillhold the same pattern. In other words, the DNA is constantly affecting theenergy around us. Our state of being affects the world second by second. Whenyou change your attitudes and state of being you change the whole because youare part of the whole, indeed you are the whole. Still feeling ordinary andpowerless? We have within us a series of micro-antenna called amino acids whichinteract with the DNA and, according to Braden, there are 64 potential humangenetic codes or antenna to transmit and receive frequencies. In short, apotential 64 antenna to connect us with higher frequencies and higher dimensionsof ourselves. But, he says, only 20 are activated while 44 remain ‘switchedoff’. This means that our ability to connect with our full power, wisdom andpotential is massively undermined. No doubt the fact that we use only a fractionof our brain’s potential is a consequence of this also. Research by theInstitute of HeartMath and others in the United States has further shown thatthese ‘antenna’ on the DNA are activated or closed down by the wavelengths ofemotion which constantly pass through the DNA. The emotion of fear (from whichall negative emotion derives) is a long, slow wavelength and so can only triggera few of our potential antennas (see Figure 57). But love (from which allpositive emotion derives) is a fast, short wavelength and so sparks into actionfar more of these antennas (see Figure 58). Thus when we are under the spell offear we delink ourselves from our true connection to infinity and live our liveswithin a small droplet of consciousness, the egg shell. When we express theemotion of love we reconnect with our multidimensional self and our potentialbecomes infinite because we become infinite. We reconnect with the ocean, with‘God’.[../Images/00034.jpg]Figure 57: Fear is a long, slow wavelength and activates very few of our DNA‘antennas’ which connect us with the Cosmos.[../Images/00010.jpg]Figure 58: Love is a short, fast wavelength which activates many more antennasand reconnects us with all that is.There is another way of putting this. Our consciousness is a series ofinterconnecting energy fields. We have our intellect, emotions, spirit and soon, all resonating to different frequencies, but interpenetrating each otherthrough a series of vortices known as chakras, a Sanskrit word meaning ‘wheelsof light’. As I mentioned earlier, it is through these chakra vortices thatemotional imbalances are passed to the mental level and, if it continues, to thephysical level. This is how stress causes illness and why we stop thinkingstraight when we are emotionally upset. The seven main chakras are placedbetween the bottom of the spine and the top of the head as in Figure 59. Thelower three connect us to the Earth and the top three connect us to the spirit,the ‘ocean’. In an ideal state, a human being is the connection between thephysical and the spiritual: Heaven and Earth. The balance point in the chakrasystem is the heart chakra from which we express the emotion of love or hatred,the highest and lowest expressions of this chakra’s frequency range. This is theorigin behind the symbolism of the heart and love. Today love is associated withthe physical heart, but it is really the spiritual heart, the heart chakra, thatwas the inspiration for this symbolism. When you are expressing love in its trueand purest sense, unconditional, non-judgemental love, as we call it, that heartchakra opens like a flower and spins very quickly with enormous power. Flowerpower! This resonates your whole lower consciousness to the frequency of purelove and, in doing so, reconnects you with your higher dimensions which resonateto that love frequency. I don’t care who you are or what you have done, yoursoul is pure love. I don’t care if you are a reptilian on another dimension, theQueen of England, George Bush, Henry Kissinger, whoever, your soul is pure love.What has happened, however, is that their lower consciousness has becomedelinked from that highest level of themselves and once that happens the lowerconsciousness can do some unbelievably horrendous things. But how can theyreconnect with their true self – pure love – while they are resonating suchhatred? They can’t. As with all of us, the only way to reconnect with pure loveis to express and live pure love. To do that, of course, they must give up theirdesire to control and dominate because while they continue with that Agenda theywill stay isolated from their infinite selves.[../Images/00066.jpg]Figure 59: The chakra system.Instead, they have sought to manipulate humanity into an even lower range ofconsciousness. The reptilians and other lower fourth dimensional entities are ina consciousness prison themselves and they want humanity to live in a smallerone. Interestingly, the Dutch surrealist painter, M. C. Escher, depicts reptilestrapped in a prison of time and space as you can see in Figure 60. That is thesituation, I feel, and until they change they will remain in jail, unable toevolve into infinity. Their aim is to keep us in there with them. The reptilianmethod for achieving this over these thousands of years has been, notsurprisingly in the wake of this evidence, through the emotion of fear. Theconstant wars, conflicts, terrorist outrages, financial worries and thecountless other negative events engineered by the Brotherhood have been designedoverwhelmingly to maintain humanity in a state of fear, therefore limited anddisconnected from its true self. The encouragement of hatred, resentment,revenge, and condemnation (all manifestations of fear) have not only added tothis, they have ensured the conditions for further conflict and fear. Still morefear, in unimaginable amounts, has been stimulated by religion. The fear of God(fear of self) and the fear of death and ‘his’ judgement. It is the same with‘science’ and the fear of dying and going to oblivion. Humanity is consumed andoverwhelmed by fear and its multifaceted expressions and that’s why we aredelinked from who we are. The Babylonian Brotherhood has made sure we haveremained ignorant of this by controlling what is taught in schools anduniversities, the institutions of ‘science’ and, therefore, what the mediaconsiders possible and credible in its arrogant and pathetic dismissal ofanything which challenges the ‘norm’. Humanity spends its life watching a moviescreen believing it to be reality while the world as it really is remains hiddenfrom view. Journalists are not reporting what is going on in the world, they arereporting the story line in the movie. I call CNN the movie channel. There is anadded bonus for the manipulators of fear. Whenever anyone is in fear they givetheir power away to anyone they believe will protect them. The technique I callproblem-reaction-solution is the manipulation of fear. It is fear, and itsoffshoots like resentment, which stimulates the calls for “Something must bedone” after wars and other outrages which then leads to the Brotherhood frontmenoffering their solutions.[../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 60: The reptilians symbolically trapped in time and space. They areimprisoned on the lower Fourth Dimension by their own attitudes and until theyopen their hearts they cannot escape. The reptilians need love more than anyone.What we are talking about here is mass mind and emotional control. If you takethe definition of mind control to be manipulating a person’s mind so they thinkand act in ways that you want, how many people on Planet Earth today are notmind controlled? The deaths of President Kennedy and Princess Diana were part ofthis. Whatever people say about the true character of JFK, the perception wasthat he represented a new hope for the future. Whether he did or not doesn’tmatter. People thought he did and so that is what he represented to them. Asmany Americans have told me over the years, something died in the Americanpsyche when he was murdered. Call it hope, innocence, whatever you like.Something deep in the spirit of America died with him. The underlying feelingwas that the good die young and evil always seems to win. It was the same withDiana, the lady associated, quite rightly in this case, with the genuineexpression of love. When she died that wave of emotion which followed was not somuch for her, the human being, it was for her, the symbol of love. The massoutpouring of grief was, if you look below the surface, the grief that somethingelse had died with her. Love had died. Goodness had died. The good die young andevil always wins. These are just two global examples of the mass psyche beingmanipulated into a sense of powerlessness and despair by the mind doctors of theBrotherhood at places like the Tavistock network in London. People in a state offear, powerlessness and despair eventually switch off and become the sheep theyare encouraged to be, drifting through their lives in numb subservience.But the manipulation of the human mind and emotions, and the disconnection fromthe infinite ocean, goes much, much, deeper than this. Remember that while thereptilians of the lower fourth dimension are spiritually and emotionallyunplugged, they are very mentally sharp and come from a high level ofintellectual knowledge. This knowledge has been hoarded in the Brotherhoodsecret society network since the ancient world while being sucked out of thepublic domain by the destruction of native cultures, the horrors of theInquisition, and the burning of great esoteric libraries like the one inAlexandria. Balance = harmony. Imbalance = disharmony. If you want disharmonyyou need imbalance. It is a simple fact and this has played a fundamental partin the Brotherhood’s techniques. The balanced female energy is the energy ofintuition and reconnection. This is where the idea of a ‘woman’s intuition’comes from. A female body is far more likely to manifest female energy inabundance and so most of the oracles, channellers and psychics in the ancientand modern world have tended to be women. But they don’t have to be. Men arejust as capable of accessing their female polarity and using this creative forceto connect with higher, intuitive levels of themselves. But such a reconnectionis not what the Brotherhood has wanted to see. They want humanity to stay in theconsciousness prison. So they have done all they can to suppress the use of thebalanced female energy. They used religion to make women servile to men with noopportunity to express themselves in their full glory. At the same time theysuppressed the female polarity in the male by creating the blueprint for what aman should be. Macho and aggressive is what we call a ‘real’ man (a lost andfrightened little boy, in truth). These ‘real’ men were and are so delinked fromtheir female energy that their intuition and connection with their higher selvesis all but extinguished. Meanwhile the Brotherhood initiates have been using thenegative frequencies of the female energy (Hecate) to connect with theirreptilian masters on the lower fourth dimension and to manipulate the worldsecretly from behind the movie screen. The suppression and perversion of sexualenergy, the creative force, is another fundamental means of limiting humanpotential to manifest their infinite power for creativity andself-determination.Interconnected with the manipulation of the female energy is the manipulation oftime. This is another aspect of the symbolism in the Pont de L’Alma Tunnel. TheBrotherhood has tuned the human consciousness into a false perspective of timeand in doing so they have disconnected humanity from the rest of creation whichoperates on a different version of time. Thus humanity is living its life out ofsync with the universe. No wonder there’s so much imbalance. In truth there isno time. Everything just is and past, present and future are happening at once.It is only our perception of time that make events appear to be happening in alinear time line. But even in linear time, we have been unplugged from thenatural flow. Nature is tuned to Moon time, the recurring 13 cycles of the Moon.The woman’s menstrual cycle is tuned to the Moon and, appropriately, it is theMoon which takes the male solar energy and reflects it back at the Earth in afemale form. The Satanists have their rituals and sacrifices every month underthe full Moon when that female energy is at the peak of its power. They takethis energy and manifest its negative polarity: Hecate. The more negative female(intuitive) energy they can focus, the more powerful their connection with the‘demons’ they seek to access and communicate with on other dimensions. This iswhy they programme sensitive psychics like Arizona Wilder to conduct theirrituals. The native peoples of the world who still live by Moon time are farmore in tune with nature because they are operating on the same time-energy flowas nature. They are in sync with it. But in 1572 Pope Gregory announced that anew calendar was to be introduced, the Gregorian Calendar, and it wasimplemented in October 1582. It was another Brotherhood scam and the GregorianCalendar became the fixed standard time for the planet. This means that thehuman mind is tuned to this manufactured flow of ‘time’ when we look at a clock,a watch, or plan the future with a diary. And where is the centre of this timesystem, the zero point from which all the world’s people tune their timepieces?Why, it’s only Greenwich in London, across the River Thames from the City ofLondon financial district, the Brotherhood’s operational heartland! And what wasthe inspiration for the Gregorian Calendar? The one used in… Babylon. Theancient Greek name for the Watchers or sons of the gods who interbred with thedaughters of men was Grigori.2 [../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos1756991] Itis the calendar of the Grigori, the reptilians.It was the reptile-Brotherhood priests of Babylon who played the same game withtime all those thousands of years ago. The Gregorian Calendar is a farce. It isthe time equivalent of throwing all your clothes in a wardrobe and leaningagainst the door to stop it flinging open. The clothes may just about fit in thespace if you push them in hard enough, but what a mess. Here we have a 12 monthyear of 60 minute hours and 24 hour days with the months so ill-fitting thatsome are 30 days, others 31, another 28, or 29 every four years. Yes, fits likea glove. But a sensible measurement of time was not the motivation.Disconnecting human consciousness from Moon time was the idea and the GregorianCalendar removed the 13th Moon. There should be 13 Moon-cycle months, butinstead we have 12 months and 12 Moon cycles. The Brotherhood hierarchy stilloperate their calendars to Moon time – another reason for their obsession with13. Crashing the car of Diana (the Moon Goddess) into the 13th pillar was alsosymbolic of this removal of the 13th Moon from the human perception of time. Andwhen you disconnect people from the natural flow of time, you are disconnectingthem from all that operates in that flow of time. Thus the Western (andincreasingly global) ‘civilisation’ has lost its rapport with the natural worldand is out of sync with its environment.The Millennium is a manufactured point in time. The moment at which theMillennium is crossed to the year 2000 only exists because of the GregorianCalendar, but as the human psyche is tuned to that, the Brotherhood is againplanning to manipulate time across the Millennium. As the Millennium approached,the tallest building in Europe was built across the River Thames from theGreenwich Observatory in London, the zero point of so-called Greenwich MeanTime. This building, named Canary Wharf, was built by a consortium ofBrotherhood business interests and it is an enormous glass obelisk. Later theBritish Government decided to spend the best part of a billion, yes a billion,pounds to build a vast dome, the Millennium Dome, which will be the focus ofofficial celebration at the time of the false Millennium. This dome is besidethe River Thames and on the opposite side, close to the global zero time line,is the Canary Wharf obelisk (see picture section). The obelisk and the dome areboth premier Brotherhood geometric symbols which draw in solar and cosmicenergy. The man in charge of the Millennium Dome project was Peter Mandelson(Bil), the man dubbed ‘the Prince of Darkness’ who was forced to resign afterrevelations about his personal finances. It was Mandelson who was the LabourParty’s chief spin doctor when they introduced the red rose as the party symbol.I am sure that in some way the Brotherhood planned to flick time at this zeropoint at Greenwich to further scramble human consciousness and stimulate stillmore imbalance and conflict. The symbol for the Millennium Dome is a naked,long-legged woman reaching for the Sun as dawn breaks over the GreenwichMeridian. It has been dubbed ‘New Britannia’ and is said to represent ‘femaleicons from prehistory to the present day’. Icons or one icon, Queen Semiramis,under different names? The artist was paid £90,000 from the National Lotteryfund for his efforts. Playing with time is a major Brotherhood weapon againsthuman consciousness. I am sure there were also originally 13 astrological signstoo, and that the 13th was represented by the spider. This sign, I feel, was onewhich encompassed all the others – weaving together their various energies and Ialways see it as located in the centre of the astrological circle. Interestinglyat Bohemian Grove their ‘Shakespearean’ motto is: “Weaving spiders come nothere”.All is consciousness in different manifestations and we are interacting withother vibrating energy fields every moment of our lives. We often feel this whenwe meet someone and feel their ‘vibes’ or we go to a house and either feeluncomfortable or immediately at home. It is the energy of the person or placethat we are feeling. As we are living within the energy fields of the Earth weare constantly affected by their vibrational state. The reptilian-Brotherhoodknow this and here you have another reason for their symbolism and ritual onsuch an apparently obsessional scale. Everything resonates at a frequency andsymbols are very powerful examples of this. A symbol is a physicalrepresentation of a thought. What that symbol means to you is the energy it willresonate. An obelisk symbolises male sexual energy, the phallus, and so that isthe energy it generates and attracts. The dome represents the womb, the female,and that is the energy it generates and attracts. The same with a pentagram, alighted torch, whatever. If they are placed in particularly powerful vortexpoints and crossover points on the Earth’s magnetic grids, they will affect thevibrational state of the global energy field even more efficiently. So it iswith the geometrical street plans and the geometrical placement of certainbuildings in relation to each other. The assassination of President Kennedy in apowerful vortex point like Dealey Plaza, and the human thought energy of horror,grief and fear focused on there, will have had a massive effect on thevibrational resonance of the Earth energy. The same, even more so, with thedeath of Diana on that Moon-energy site in Paris. This is all part of the spellcast by the reptilians on the human mind and emotions to delink us from our trueand infinite power. Also the more negative emotion we can be manipulated to feelby these and other events, the more we generate our own fear into the Earthfields and the downward spiral goes on.There is another point here which is highly relevant to the next section.Research has shown that there is a pulse, an electrical signal, which isgenerated from the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy to our Sun (and other suns)and from there to the Earth. This pulse is then picked up by the human heartchakra, passed onto the brain, and goes out from there to the cells of the body.When that pulse, that resonance, is passed through that sequence intact andunbroken the human being is at one with the cosmos. Every cell is connected to,and in harmony with, the cosmic pulse. What gets in the way, however, is lowvibrational emotion and imbalance which breaks the circuit and, once again,disconnects us from the Earth and the wider universe. The heart-brain connectionhas been broken in most people by the separation of the head and the heart, theintellect and the intuition, the physical and the spiritual. The reason thereptilian-Brotherhood is pressing forward with its Agenda so quickly today isthat it knows it has a colossal challenge on its hands. Creation is governed byenergy cycles. At one level we see them with the Earth seasons, spring, summer,autumn and winter. But there are much bigger cycles, too, and these have beenrecorded in numbers and symbols by the ancients like the Sumerians, Egyptians,Hindus, Chinese, the Maya of Central America and the Native Americans like theHopi of Arizona. These measure the cycles of solar, lunar and other cosmicenergies which transform the Earth’s energy fields and so transform life on thisplanet. We are now in the midst of perhaps the greatest of these transformativecycles, one which happens, it is estimated, only once every 26,000 years (thecycle called precession), and the Maya calendar predicts that the criticalchangeover point is December 12th 2012. This is the real focal point of thetransformation, not the manufactured Millennium. These consciousness cycles arelike doorways or gateways which open for those who are ready to move throughinto a much higher state of consciousness. I see it as a sort of cuckoo clock inwhich, at certain key moments in time (or rather cycles), the door or gatewayopens. When these gateways are missed, the cycle begins again until anothergateway opens. But what we are facing now, it would seem, is not so much agateway as a vast chasm of opportunity for a global transformation that willdefy all current belief. Religious and mystery school texts have been openly orsymbolically predicting this for thousands of years. Now the physical, spiritualand, increasingly, scientific evidence is there to confirm that the so-called‘Great Shift of the Ages’ is upon us.A series of events, described by Gregg Braden in Awakening To Zero Point, haveconfirmed that the times they are a changing. In 1991 a new frequency wasidentified resonating from the centre of the spiral of our Milky Way Galaxy andin 1994 the Ulysses Probe was sent to investigate changes on the Sun. From themid-1980s there was a terrific increase in solar flares and X-ray bursts, andUlysses discovered that the Sun’s magnetic field was rapidly decreasing. Thereadings at the north and south poles and at the equator were much lower thanexpected. Also, while the Sun is cooling, the planets of the solar system,especially the outer ones, are heating up. This suggests that the source ofplanetary heat comes from within, although this may be stimulated by magneticand electrical changes in the Sun. At the same time these changes were happeningon the Sun, a storm on Jupiter, first documented by the Chinese 3,000 years ago,showed sudden changes also. A vast spiral within this Jupiter storm began tospin in the other direction. The shock waves and other phenomena caused by thecollision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy into Jupiter in 1994 have also affectedthe wider solar system, including the Earth. What is clear is that the changesin the Sun’s magnetic field have been mirrored here.The Earth is a giant magnet with different levels rotating to create a magneticfield. Braden says that the faster the Earth rotates, the more powerful anddense the magnetic field. Two thousand years ago this magnetic field reached thepeak of its intensity in the current cycle and it has been falling ever since asthe planet has rotated slower and slower, Braden says. The field is now 50% lesspowerful than it was 1,500 years ago and the speed of this fall is increasingvery quickly. There is no need to panic because this is all part of a naturalcycle, a longer and infinitely more powerful version of the annual seasons.Alongside this comes the news that the Earth’s resonant frequency, it’s heartbeat if you like, is increasing rapidly. This frequency, called the BaseResonant Frequency or Schumann Cavity Resonance, was identified in 1899. Betweenthen and the mid-1980s, it maintained a constant pulse of around 7.8 Hertz or 7cycles per second. But from 1986-87 it apparently began to quicken. By the endof 1995 it had reached 8.6 according to some estimates and the last I heard itwas said to be above ten and still rising. Gregg Braden believes that by theMaya transformation year of 2012, the Earth’s resonance could be 13 cycles persecond while her magnetic field could be at or near zero. He calls this ZeroPoint when the Earth’s magnetic field will all but disappear because theplanet’s rotation will have stopped. This doesn’t mean there will be no gravitybecause that is created by other phenomena, not the spin of the planet.Something like this seems to have happened at least 14 times in the last 4.5million years. The last is estimated to have been about 11-13,000 years ago, awindow of time which corresponds with many estimates of the end of Atlantis andthe beginning of the recovery from that great cataclysm after about 10,500 BC.13,000 years ago would have been the halfway point in the Great Cycle of 26,000years which is ending now, another time of great change. I am not saying theEarth is going to stop rotating, only that Braden suggests this possibility.It could be, however, that there was a magnetic pole shift more recently, about3,500-600 years ago from examination of the ice in Greenland and the polarregions. Every time the Earth has experienced the rapid fall in the magneticfield that we are seeing now, it has led to a pole shift when magnetic north andsouth change places. People like Braden estimate that the Earth will stoprotating for some days before it begins to spin in the opposite direction. Asyou can see when the flow of electricity through an iron bar is reversed, thepoles reverse. As the planet spins in the other direction, the flow ofelectricity will reverse and so, therefore, must the poles. If the planetstopped rotating, one side of the Earth would be in constant sunshine and theother in darkness in this period and that is what the ancients said happenedthousands of years ago. The Peruvians talked about the ‘long night’ of threedays and in the Bible there is reference to daytime lasting 20 hours, thelongest day. The Hopi Tribe record how the Sun rose twice in one day. First itrose in the west and set in the east and then later it rose in the east and setin the west – the cycle ever since. Other ancient accounts say the Sun used torise in the west and set in the east, another indication that the Earth used tospin the other way. Back in the early 1990s when I was just waking up to thesethings, I was given some channelled information by a psychic which said: “Theworld is changing and the north will become south and the east, west. So it hasbeen commanded since the beginning of time.”3[../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos1757107] Spot on, it would seem. BrianDesborough, the scientist-researcher in California, also told me that some majorgeophysical events are happening which are subject to a media blackout. Heconfirms that the Earth’s geomagnetic field is dropping at an exponential rateand will soon reach zero. He believes, as I do, that we are, to say the least,in for a very bumpy ride geologically. The US Geological Service says that theEarth’s magnetic field drops to zero every 500,000 years, then slowly rebuilds,and that these are periods of cataclysmic Earth changes, earthquakes andvolcanoes. I think it happens more often than that. According to Brian’scontacts, the Sun’s magnetic field has already dropped to zero and it appears tohave reached a higher level of conversion of hydrogen to helium. He says thatsolar flares are being emitted above and below the Sun’s equator at a latitudeof 19.5 degrees. This is the point where energy is exchanged between rotatingspheres and it is at this latitude on the Earth that the pyramids are located.The energy being received from the Sun at these latitudes must now bephenomenal.We have followed the connection between changes in the resonance from the centreof the galaxy, to changes in the Sun, to changes in the Earth. It goes on fromthere to the human heart, then the brain and to every cell in the body. The moreyou open your heart the more powerful this flow and the quicker you willsynchronise with the rising vibrations and transform into a higher state ofconsciousness. If you close your heart and close your mind, you will beresisting these changes and more and more of your energy will be spent fightingthe very energies that will transform your life and set you free. Also, yourbody will get increasingly out of sync with the energy around you and theconsequences, mentally, emotionally and physically will be obvious. You canstand in this fast flowing river trying to hold it back, or you can relax, lieon the air bed and flow with it. It is your choice and whatever happens you liveforever. If we allow ourselves to be infused by this high frequency light, ourbodies will repair themselves and we will not age. We will live in physicalbodies indefinitely if we wish to and our mental and psychic powers will know nobounds, no limitations. If it is also correct that we are entering a massiveelectrical field called a Photon Belt we are going to experience some amazingthings. The ancients knew of these great cycles of change and all the ancientcalendars of the Egyptians, Maya, Tibetans, Chinese and others end in the periodwe are living through now. That Egyptian calendar dates back some 39,000 yearsand the Mayan one perhaps 18,000. The Maya said that there would be a transitionperiod between the old world and the new as one version of time was replaced byanother. They called this period ‘No Time’ and they said this would begin inJuly 1982 and lead to the shift on December 12th 2012. The effect of all this onhumanity is easy to see. I have visited more than 20 countries in the last fewyears and there is an awakening unfolding in all of them. Not yet the majorityby any means, but the numbers are gathering by the day as this spiritual alarmclock awakens people from their slumber. It is the quickening vibration of theEarth, and indeed the galaxy in general, which is giving the impression thattime is passing faster and faster. This is an illusion because there is no time,in truth, but it feels that way because the frequency is getting faster. Iremember I was given a channelled communication through a psychic in the early1990s which said that the day was coming when time would seem to be moving soquickly it would be frightening. That moment is near. It’s nothing to worryabout, just a natural cycle, but it will present many challenges and thereforeinfinite opportunities.The universe, like the whole of the physical world, is a hologram – beams oflight colliding to create the appearance of three-dimensional form. It is likethrowing stones into a pond and watching the waves collide and create patterns.Two scientists in the United States, Terrance and Dennis McKenna, suggest thatthe universe is a hologram of 64 waves or time scales and this is why we havethe 64 hexagrams of the I-Ching, 64 keys of the Tree of Life, and the 64 codonsof the DNA. Their computer analysis suggests that all 64 of these waves aregoing to peak together in 2012. This is going to make the next few years aperiod of staggering change. The McKennas’ say that the speed of change has goneon doubling in a smaller and smaller time frame, manifesting as the leaps intechnological development in this century. Projecting forward they say that thiswill continue to the transformation year of 2012 when in a period of 384 daysthere will be more transformations of consciousness than in all the previouscycles put together. After this there will be a six day cycle in which eventswill move even faster and in the last 135 minutes there will be eighteen furtherenormous leaps in human consciousness, culminating in the last .0075 of a secondwhen another 13 will occur. I don’t think we’ll be watching The Price Is Rightwhile this is happening somehow. “I say dear, I think I’ve just gone though anumber of life-changing transformations while that last advert was on. Cup oftea?”The Brotherhood have technology to mess with the weather and they use it, nodoubt about that. But the phenomena I have described in this chapter are thereal reason for the dramatic changes in global weather patterns which arebecoming more extreme by the month. We have seen nothing yet. As I said, amidgreat public ridicule in Britain in the early 1990s, enormous changes in climatepatterns and extremes of weather are likely in this period, along withgeological effects as the Earth restructures herself and prepares her body forthe shift in the same way that humans are having to do. We and the Earth arebeing challenged to synchronise our consciousness and its physical expressionwith the rapidly accelerating frequencies now bathing the planet. TheBrotherhood are seeking desperately to hide these facts by blaming the weatherchanges on the ‘Greenhouse Effect’ or ‘El Nino’. They know that once peoplerealise that something very different is happening the dominoes will fall andthe game will be up. It was the Brotherhood who created the New Age Movement todivert the awakening. The term New Age is the name of a Freemasonic magazine. Amind controlled slave of the American Government, now recovering, confirmed tome that the New Age was launched covertly by Henry Kissinger and others whileshe was under his control in the 1970s. Whenever I have made these points, NewAgers have dismissed the idea because, they say, the Brotherhood would not wantthe people to encompass a different view of life. No, not in an ideal world theywouldn’t, but this is not an ideal world for them because the energy changes arewaking people up. The Brotherhood knew this was coming and what its affect wouldbe. They couldn’t jump in a spacecraft and fiddle with the Sun or go into thecentre of the galaxy to switch off the new vibration. Their only alternative wasto hijack the awakening consciousness and lead it into another cul-de-sac,another rules-and-regulations-religion, where it would be no threat to theBrotherhood Agenda. This they have done with the New Age Movement. There aresome very sensible and aware people within the New Age doing some great work,but so many others are in denial of what is going on in the world. They arebeing misled by other dimensional entities, Brotherhood transmissions on thepsychic frequencies and channelled communications from the lower fourthdimension. They sit around their candles or wait for an extraterrestrial ‘AshtarCommand’ to come and whisk them off the planet in a spaceship. Ashtar is aBrotherhood concoction and a play on words with ancient deities like Ashterothand Ishtar, another name for Queen Semiramis. Much of the New Age mentality willnot even talk about the Brotherhood manipulation because ‘it’s negative’. Yes itis and it will stay that way until we acknowledge it and change it. Running awayor hovering near the ceiling won’t make a difference. So much of the New Age isnot spirituality as change, but spirituality as escapism. It is suppressing anddiverting the awakening, not advancing it.We are clearly being prepared for revelations about the reptilians, because thehighly charged, higher frequency energies will increase dramatically the numberof people who see the reptilians of the lower fourth dimension. Arizona Wildertold me that the number of sacrificial rituals has increased massively since the1980s because the reptilians need more and more human blood and energy to holdtheir human form. They need the microchipped control in place before they areseen openly as reptiles as the vibrational changes advance. The changes aretaking away the reptilians’ vibrational cover and the truth has to come out. Inpreparation for this there is a very long list of movies and televisionprogrammes for adults and children about reptile humanoids, friendly andotherwise. I have mentioned The Arrival and V: The Final Battle, but there aremany more. In Stargate, the story of time-travelling to an ancient Egyptcontrolled by extraterrestrials, the possible reptile nature of the ‘alien’ isrevealed when his skin is ripped away at the end. Stargate: SG-1 continues thetheme of reptilians occupying human form; Enemy Mine and Dreamscape, bothstarring Dennis Quaid, feature reptile humanoids; Theodore Rex is about a sevenfoot tall upright-walking dinosaur; Babylon 5, the television series, includesthe reptile humanoids called the Narns and the same theme can be seen in StarTrek; Star Trek, The Next Generation; Space Precinct; Seaquest DSV; OuterLimits, and elsewhere. Steven Speilberg’s Jurassic Park and Lost World bringdinosaurs back to life and his video animation for children, We’re Back,features two-legged speaking dinosaurs. In one scene a T-Rex is taken into aspaceship, endowed with intelligence and taken forward in time to the presentday. Children’s movies and television series are awash with reptilian imagery.Mario Brothers is based on the idea that the dinosaurs were not wiped out by themeteorite and in fact the impact created a parallel dimension where thedinosaurs continued to live and thrive and evolved into intelligent humanoids.The film’s heroes go into an underground passage where they fall into that otherdimension and battle with humanoid dinosaurs to prevent the invasion of thisdimension. Dinotopia and Dinotopia: The World Beneath, the children’s books byJames Gurney, are stories of an inner-earth world in which intelligentreptilians and dinosaurs living under the ground with humans. Land Of The Lostfeatures a family who travel back in time to a dinosaur-dominated land wherethey are attacked by a race of reptile humanoids called the Sleestak. In oneepisode, a reptilian humanoid studies humans who radiate ‘emotional heat’ – thehuman emotional energy on which the reptilians thrive. The children’s series,Barney, is about a friendly reptilian and Mutant Ninja Turtles areamphibian-reptilian fighters of crime and injustice. Dinosaurs in the early1990s was a children’s television programme about a loveable family ofdinosaurs, interestingly called the Sinclair family! One of them is called Earl!Cartoons like Dinosaucers; Mutant League; G. I. Joe and Dino Power House alsoinclude intelligent reptile beings.4[../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos1757307] A coincidence? Of course not.For a long time the reptilian-Brotherhood has been preparing to stop humanitymaking the consciousness shift. The pyramid hierarchical nature of theirstructure has allowed them to instigate the same plan through countlessdifferent institutions and agencies. First they have attacked us at the physicallevel with drugs, food additives and fluoride in the water. The ancient methodsof healing (known today as alternative or complementary) are under constantassault from the medical establishment which is awash with Freemasons and underthe control of the Brotherhood pharmaceutical cartel. The Rockefeller empirealone now owns more than 60% of the pharmaceutical industry in the UnitedStates. These, and the other wings of the global pharmaceutical cartel, fund the‘research’ into new treatments and, of course, these ‘treatments’ always turnout to be drugs. There is an excellent book documenting this called The MedicalMafia by a Canadian doctor, Guylaine Lanctot, which is available through DavidIcke Books. The pharmaceutical cartel interlocks with the major global ‘food’producers like Nestle, Kellogg, Proctor and Gamble and the rest. Through thisnetwork the Brotherhood can orchestrate a concerted attack on the human body andits mental processes through the drugs, vaccines and food additives.Genetically-engineered animals and food is part of this, also. When one of theBritish scientists involved in the development of genetically-engineered foodpublicly questioned its safety, he was immediately sacked. So much for living ina country with freedom of expression. Fluoride in the water is a mindsuppressant and so are sweeteners like aspartame which you find today in almostall the soft drinks. These additives are designed to make it more difficult forthe brain and the cells to tune into the new frequencies. Workers in the foodfactories have no idea what they are doing as they just follow orders. Thedecisions are being taken at a much higher level. It is the same withvaccinations, one of the biggest medical scams of them all. The doctors (most ofthem) and the nurses have no idea of the damage they are doing to a child’sbody, mind and immune system, when they administer vaccinations. But those whoorchestrate the vaccination programmes certainly do. The Brotherhood have alsocreated a highly complex network of technology to capture the human collectiveconsciousness and delink it from the rest of its multidimensional self. Thisstarts out in space with the ‘Star Wars’ technology which is part of a vastelectromagnetic web on and around the Earth. It includes: Extremely LowFrequency (ELF) transmitters which are broadcasting their signals all over theworld; microwave transmissions which include direct attacks on those theBrotherhood wish to kill or discredit through mind manipulation; the mobilephone networks which do enormous mental and physical damage and allow the ownerto be tracked even when the phone is switched off; emissions from televisions,microwave ovens and other technology; and, of course, the microchip. The mainreason for the campaign for a microchipped population is to suppress theawakening and disconnect us from the pulses that are setting us free. A CIAscientist told me that microchipping the population will give the Brotherhoodcontrol of a person’s thoughts, emotions and physical health.A contact in the financial world, who accepts the reptilian connection from hisown experience, gave me some interesting background to the modern energysystems. He had worked with a number of free energy inventors and he realisedthat free energy technology worked in a ‘clockwise’ direction and so was inharmony with the spin of the chakras. But most conventional electricaltechnology was ‘anticlockwise’, therefore in conflict with the chakras. Hebelieved that this was helping to close down the chakra system and delinkhumanity from other levels of consciousness. This is one reason why thereptilian-Brotherhood have suppressed, often through murder, the development offree energy technology. The average wiring system in the home works at 60 cyclesper second which is very detrimental to the body and affects brain waveactivity. Brian Desborough told me how people develop back ailments and otherproblems if their bed is pushed against a wall which carries internal wiring.Their complaints often clear up if they move the bed a few feet from the wall.We live in a pulsating ocean of electromagnetism generated by ‘modern’technology and this is constantly affecting human physical, emotional and mentalhealth. The human mind, body and emotions are under an incredible assault in thecountdown to the Great Shift because the Brotherhood are desperate to ensurethat humanity as a whole does not make the consciousness leap that will take usbeyond the reptilian frequencies.The Brotherhood have also structured the ‘education’ system and the media tolock people in what I call the left brain prison. The left brain is the areawhich deals with the physical world view, ‘rational’ thought and all that can beseen, touched, heard and smelled (see Figure 61). The right brain is ourintuition and our connection with higher dimensions. This is where you find theartist and creativity, inspired by our uniqueness of thought and expression (seeFigure 62). The education system and its offshoots, like the media and science,are designed to speak to the left brain and to switch off right brain thinking.This is why spending on the arts in schools is being cut back all over the worldand rigid, left brain programmes imposed. ‘Education’ fills the left brain withinformation, much of which is untrue and inaccurate, and it demands that this isstored and then regurgitated on the exam paper. If you do this like a robot youpass. If, however, you filter the information through the right brain and say“Hey, this is piece of shit”, you won’t pass even though you will be telling thetruth. Isn’t education just wonderful?With fear as the reptilians’ greatest weapon, the plan is to engineer events,real and staged, that will create enormous fear in the countdown years to 2012.This includes a plan to start a third world war either by stimulating the Muslimworld into a ‘holy war’ against the West or by using the Chinese to cause globalconflict. Maybe both. The bombs placed near US embassies in Africa in 1998 andthe American response of bombing Islamic targets is all part of this. One oftheir key plans is called Project Bluebeam. One element of this is to uselaser-generating satellites in the ‘Star Wars’ network in different parts of theworld to project holographic images in the sky of UFOs, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha,Krishna, etc. With each belief system convinced that their saviour has come, thepotential for enormous religious conflict is obvious. Messages will be broadcast(as they already are) on the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF), Very Low Frequency(VLF), Low Frequency (LF) and microwave bands which can be picked up by thehuman brain. This technology is highly sophisticated today and many people willbelieve that ‘God’ and their ‘saviour’ is talking to them when it is really theBrotherhood manipulators. Much ‘channelled’ information comes from this sourcealready. Project Bluebeam also involves the manifestation of ‘supernatural’phenomena of many kinds to terrify the population and amid the terror andconflict, also via holographic image in the sky, the Brotherhood ‘saviour’ willcome. It must be emphasised also, as we consider Project Bluebeam, that the cropcircle phenomena does not have to be extraterrestrial or ‘supernatural’, as mostinvestigators believe. It could be, but it doesn’t have to be. In the periodbefore the complex crop patterns first appeared in the 1980s the technology wasdeveloped which could create them. This was a high frequency gamma-ray beamdevice which was developed for the military. Some of the main characteristics ofthe genuine crop circles (many have been hoaxed) are: the stalks bend at thelowest node and do not break; the cell structure changes; the crop pattern emitsmicrowave energy; dead animals inside are carbonised; a high frequency sound orclicking noise is heard when the pattern is first formed; plasma lights aresometimes seen. Every one of these effects would be caused by the gamma-ray beamdevice. The scientist and researcher Brian Desborough says:[../Images/00002.jpg]Figure 61: The Brotherhood system seeks to imprison the human psyche in the leftbrain, the ‘rational’ intellect which only believes what it can see, touch, hearor smell. The ‘education’ system and the media are structured for this and mostteachers, lecturers, scientists and journalists are left brain prisonersthemselves.[../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 62: When we open our hearts and minds we activate the right brain, theintuition and inspiration which connects with the cosmos.“The high frequency gamma-ray beam would cause the moisture in the nodes toboil, swelling and softening the nodal cells and causing the straw to bend inthe direction swept by the beam. Such beams are capable of creating extremelyfine detail; the high frequency sound which is emitted from newly-formed cropcircles strongly suggests that the beam systems employed in this duplicitous actincorporate Mossbaur technology. The soil within the circle would emit radiationand any creature unfortunate enough to be irradiated by the beam would becarbonised… Prior to commencing a crop circle, the gamma-ray beam would requireadjustment for focus and power setting. This could account for the one or moresmall circular depressions usually to be found adjacent to the crop circle.”Some people will ask why, if they are made by the authorities, such an effortwould have been made to discredit them with hoaxers to the point where the medianow ignore them. It’s a very good question, but the fact remains that humantechnology can make them and we should know that. Incidentally, Desboroughsuggests that flight TWA 800, the jumbo jet which exploded shortly aftertake-off from New York, was struck by a Mossbaur beam weapon. The autopsy on thevictims revealed that their blood had gelled in their veins and their brains had‘turned to mush’. This is what the weapon would produce, and at the time theaircraft was flying near the Brookhaven Naval Research Station where this veryweapon was developed.The UFO scamThe main ambition for Project Bluebeam is to convince the people that the Earthis being invaded by extraterrestrials. It is vital we do not buy this crap. Theextraterrestrials are not invading, they’ve been here for thousands of years andthey look, on the surface, like you and me. In 1938 the actor Orson Wellesclaimed to be broadcasting live from the site of an ‘alien’ landing in NewJersey. He wasn’t, he was using actors and special effects to broadcast from aradio studio. The programme, a broadcast of the ‘novel’ War Of The Worlds by H.G. Wells, caused terror and panic in the place the invading Martians were saidto be. One guy committed suicide and there were traffic jams of people trying toget away because they thought the Martians had come. Welles said it was just aplay and people had misunderstood. This was in fact an experiment to see howpeople would react to such a situation and they used a story written by H. G.Wells, a Brotherhood clone who advocated the reptilian Agenda, including massmind control. Think about it. If you wanted an excuse to globally centralise allgovernment, finance, military, police and other institutions, you would need athreat to the planet as a whole. What better way than to kid the people they arebeing invaded from space? You would have a global problem, a global demand that“Something must be done” and an opportunity to offer a global solution: a worldgovernment and army to meet this ‘threat’. That is the plan we are now beingprepared for.Back in the 1960s during the Kennedy administration, it is claimed that a groupof 15 experts in their various fields were brought together to produce a reportinto ways of controlling the population and centralising power without the useof wars. It became known as the Report from Iron Mountain, an undergroundfacility in New York State, where they held their first and last meetings. Oneof the members leaked the contents to a friend who leaked it more widely, it issaid. I detail the report in …And The Truth Shall Set You Free. It is claimed tobe a hoax, but if it was, it was an inspired one. Two of the recommendations itmade to centralise power were: a threat to the global environment and a threatfrom an extraterrestrial invasion. The report was completed in 1966, the storygoes, and in 1968 came the Club of Rome, the Brotherhood-front I talked aboutearlier, which created the environmental movement. The environmentalrecommendation in the Report from Iron Mountain clearly happened. Now they areplaying the extraterrestrial card. For decades the idea of extraterrestrials wasdismissed and laughed at by the media, but suddenly, now the time is right, theyare taking it more and more seriously. UFO ‘research’ in the United States hasbeen funded by Laurence Rockefeller and this has included a panel of ninescientists led by the Stanford physicist Peter Sturrock. He told Americantelevision that they had found ‘compelling physical evidence’ that something isgoing on that they do not understand. Now, I wonder what that can be? And lookat the stream of fear-based extraterrestrial television programmes and movieslike Independence Day (made by 20th Century Fox owned by Rupert Murdoch), AlienResurrection (made by 20th Century Fox owned by Rupert Murdoch) and X-Files(made by Fox Television owned by Rupert Murdoch). And, I should add, RupertMurdoch is owned by the Brotherhood.Underpinning these messages are the countless reports of UFOs being seen and theexperiences of large numbers of people who claim to have been abducted byextraterrestrials. I am not saying this does not happen at all, I have no doubtthat it does, but some things we can say. The ‘abductees’ invariably recall one,some or all of the following: missing time, clicking or buzzing sounds, sexualfeelings and a sulphurous odour. Brian Desborough points out that these are alltypical of contact with intense electromagnetic fields and are caused byneurochemical changes in the brain as he explains in detail. I repeat, I am notsaying that abductions don’t happen, only that there are other explanations forsome of these stories. As long ago as 1930, Professor Cazamalli discovered thathallucinations could be induced by electromagnetic frequencies of 500 Megahertz.These phenomena can even be stimulated by areas of geopathic stress in the Earthand by overhead power lines, both of which produce electromagnetic fields andthey can certainly be produced by the electromagnetic technology used by theBrotherhood in their mind control projects. The effect and potential ofelectromagnetic fields to take people into altered states of consciousness andto trigger many ‘supernatural’ phenomena is enormous. Unless we understand this,extraterrestrial explanations can be given for very terrestrial events. Thisapplies to plasma balls and lights in the sky which are commonly caused byelectromagnetic projections from the Earth. The modern explosion of UFOsightings did not begin until after the Second World War, by which time theGermans for one had developed forms of ‘flying saucers’. Project Paperclip wasthe British Intelligence-American Intelligence operation to spring the top Naziscientists, engineers, geneticists and mind manipulators from Germany and takethem to North or South America. This would have transferred this ‘UFO’ knowledgeacross the Atlantic and it was soon after this that the flying saucers werereported in increasing numbers in the United States. The famous Roswell incidenthappened in 1947. Cattle mutilations have been blamed on extraterrestrialsbecause, it is said, there is no human technology that could dissect the cattleand drain their blood in this way. But Brian Desborough points out that this isnot true. A portable laser of the type necessary was developed by the USAirforce Phillips Laboratory for use by special forces personnel and it wasafter this that the cattle mutilations began. Some of the first ones happenednear the chemical warfare laboratory at Dulce in New Mexico and Desboroughsuggests that the cattle are being abducted as part of this research. This wouldexplain why many of them are daubed with luminous paint which can only be seenat night. These cattle can be winched aboard a craft, their body parts removed,and returned to a different area of the field, so leaving no footprints andcreating a great ‘mystery’. Many uninformed (or otherwise) UFO researchers saythat craft like the one at Roswell must be extraterrestrial because they aremade of a material with a non-crystalline structure which cannot be produced onEarth or cut with human tools. Not true again. Desborough says that the processof producing such metals is called splat cooling. “Molten metal is deposited ona cryogenically-cooled surface (which) results in a non-crystalline product.Similarly, when metal is compressed at temperatures approaching absolute zero,the metal attains a room temperature hardness of a diamond.”5[../Text/index_split_049.html#filepos1757418] But I want to emphasise again thatI am not saying that people are not abducted by other life forms, or that cattleare not mutilated by them, or that extraterrestrial technology is not to befound on Earth. All three are true, of that I have no doubt, but what I ampointing out here is that not all such cases are necessarily from these sources.There are other explanations.The UFO ‘research’ community is alive with Brotherhood disinformants andintelligence gatherers. A number of the main ‘whistle-blowers’ and UFO authorsare members of an intelligence unit known as the Aviary because their code namesare all birds. It makes you wonder how ‘former’ intelligence operatives areallowed to talk freely about secret projects when to do so should mean severeaction against them and the loss of all pension rights for violation of theiroath of secrecy. Then there’s the technology known as EDOM (ElectronicDissolution of Memory) which is used on former intelligence operatives toextinguish knowledge the authorities do not want revealed. Other Aviary membersor operatives include many of the hypnotists who ‘help’ the ‘abductees’ torecall their ‘memories’ of ‘alien’ abduction. Some of the ‘star’ contactees haveconnections to secret projects. George Adamski was involved with scientists atthe Point Loma Naval Electronics Laboratory and a similar operation in Pasadena,when he announced his extraterrestrial contacts to the world. The microchipswhich are claimed to have been implanted in abductees by extraterrestrials are,in fact, very much of the Earth. They were developed by a consortium ofengineers from Motorola, General Electric, IBM and the Boston Medical Center.One example is the IBM 2020 chip used in the Project Monarch mind controlprogramme. These are also implanted in their unsuspecting patients by doctorsand dentists under contract to the intelligence agencies. More and more booksare now being published about evil aliens who are invading the planet and sowhere is all this leading? I’ll let Henry Kissinger answer that one in a passagefrom a speech at the 1992 Bilderberg meeting at Evian-Les-Bains, in France. Itwas written down, it seems, by a Swiss delegate. Kissinger said:“Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restoreorder; tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were toldthat there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, thatthreatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world willplead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil.“The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with thisscenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee oftheir well being granted to them by their world government.”That’s the reason for the UFO scam. Problem-reaction-solution. Theextraterrestrials are not invading they are already here and they are the ones,operating through physical bodies, who will offer to ‘save’ us from theinvasion! The UFO investigator and lecturer Norio Hayakawa says this plan iscalled ‘Project Panic’ and that high technology equipment will be used to createan optical illusion of a UFO invasion. This will give governments and the UnitedNations the excuse to call a global state of emergency and all those emergencypowers and executive orders will be implemented. As I detailed earlier, theexecutive orders passed this century by Presidents of the United States withoutCongressional debate or approval will allow the Government to take overtransport, energy, your home and all media. These executive orders allow theGovernment to tell you where you will live and to put you to work in any waythey want. Your children can be taken away from you, anything goes when thoseorders are enforced by a manufactured ‘emergency’. You will find that similarpowers are available to all governments in these circumstances. Other aspects ofthe Brotherhood Agenda, across the ‘Millennium’ and the years to 2012, include:a global financial collapse to introduce the one-world electronic currency;conflicts and terrorism galore; and a whole range of other events to terrify anddispirit the human population into unquestioning servitude.But it doesn’t have to be like this. You are not an ‘ordinary’, ‘powerless’human being. You are an aspect of eternal consciousness, a genius waiting tohappen. All you need to do is open your heart, open your mind, reconnect withthat genius and grasp your infinite power to create your own destiny. That isour challenge in this incredible time of opportunity and we are going to seefreedom return to this planet for the first time in so, so long."},{"pageContent":"■ SOURCES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [../Text/index_split_048.html#filepos1690935] Gregg Braden, Awakening To ZeroPoint (Laura Lee Productions, 1996).2 [../Text/index_split_048.html#filepos1706507] From The Ashes Of Angels, p 18.3 [../Text/index_split_048.html#filepos1720578] David Icke, The Truth Vibrations(Gateway Books, Wellow, Bath, England, first published by Aquarian Books in1991).4 [../Text/index_split_048.html#filepos1732820] John Rhodes, the Reptoidwebsite.5 [../Text/index_split_048.html#filepos1751577] Brian Desborough, \"An Overviewof UFO Contact and Abduction Phenomena”, information paper for author, 1998."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos9627]Breaking the spell [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos9627]What I am about to outline is the information the Brotherhood most want tosuppress. It is the knowledge that you are in control of your destiny and no-oneelse is. You always have been and always will be.Reading this book you may find that strange. After all, have I not detailed howthe Brotherhood have controlled the world for thousands of years? Yes, but howhave they done that? By manipulating the way humanity thinks and feels. How wethink and feel creates our physical experience and if we allow an outside forceto manipulate our mind and emotions, we will allow them to control our physicalexperience, our destiny. But we can change that in an instant if we take backcontrol of our thinking and emotions. Creating our own reality and deciding ourown destiny is, at its heart, a very simple process. It can be summed up by“What we give out is what we get back”. It works like this…Our mind and emotions resonate wavelengths of various frequencies depending onhow we are thinking and feeling. This applies not only to our conscious self,but also our subconscious, that cauldron of suppressed thoughts, attitudes andemotions that we would rather not deal with. You can resonate the vibration ofanger from that level without actually feeling the emotion consciously at thetime. For instance, an adult who is holding on to suppressed anger about theirchildhood, will still be broadcasting that frequency, even though they might notbe consciously aware of being angry. This will draw to them, by the law ofvibrational attraction, other people who are consciously and subconsciouslyangry. I know, I’ve been there. In the words of a song I heard in the UnitedStates: “When you hold anger, guess what comes to you? A lot of very angrypeople do.” Our mental and emotional ‘vibes’ of all kinds are broadcast as aseries of wave patterns and these draw towards us similar wave patterns in theform of people, places, ways of life and experiences. What we give out, weattract to us. Within this cocktail of vibrations are our conscious thoughts andfeelings and the astrological patterns we take on at birth and/or, some say,conception. When we are born we absorb the energy pattern in the Earth’s fieldat the time and in the place we enter this world. This pattern depends on wherethe planets are in their cycles and, therefore, which of their energies are mosteffecting the Earth. Every second the energy field is changing and so when andwhere we are born matters enormously to the energy field we inherit. We choosewhere and when we are born to take on the energy pattern most appropriate forour lifeplan. Look at the endless evidence of how people in certain professionstend to be born in the same period of the year. The Babylonian Brotherhood,particularly through Christianity and ‘science’, has sought to condemn astrologyas either evil or ridiculous to encourage people to dismiss it. Once again,Christians have done excellent work for the Brotherhood in this regard, most ofthem without any idea of the Agenda they were advancing.This cocktail of interacting vibrations draws towards us a reflection of itself.When we think we are a victim and we are not in control of our lives, we willsynchronise with the energies (people, experiences) which resonate to thatfrequency. We will therefore create a victimised, powerless physical experience.When we believe that the best things in life happen to others, they do, becausewe are not connecting with the energies that will manifest the best things inlife. When you believe you will never have enough money, you won’t. Money is anenergy and if you are going to attract that energy, you need to make avibrational connection with it. Thinking that you will never attract money,consciously or subconsciously, ensures that you will be out of sync with thatenergy and you stay poor. The Brotherhood know this and they have created anenergy flow which attracts money to them. Fear of something is always guaranteedto attract what you fear. The energy of fear attracts like energy and so whatyou fear becomes what you physically experience. Fear of being without moneybecomes the circumstances in which you are without money. Fear of being alone,rejected or attacked all become that physical experience unless you deal withthe source of the energy which manifests these things – YOU. So its no goodblaming anyone else for your life. You have either created it by your ownthoughts and feelings or the Brotherhood has done so because you have allowedyour thoughts and feelings to be manipulated by religion, the media, politics,doctors, teachers and all the rest. Whichever it is, the one responsible foryour life is… YOU. No getting away from it, I’m afraid, you are stuck with it.But then, this news is just wonderful. It means that if you created the presentreality that you don’t like, you can just as easily create a new reality thatyou do like. You are in control. You have all the answers. You are the centre ofyour own universe and you can make it whatever you choose. You are simplyincredible. Feel it, live it and your world will be transformed.My book, I Am Me, I Am Free, is all about this need to restore our mental andemotional powers because unless we do so we can never be free. But we need to domore than that. We need to set ourselves free, yes, but just as importantly weneed to set each other free. We have been manipulated by the Brotherhood intoour personal prisons and the prisoners have been further manipulated intopolicing each other. Humanity is both the sheep and the sheep dog. TheBrotherhood set the religious, political, medical and scientific ‘norms’ bycontrolling those professions and, therefore, the norms promoted by themesmerised media. Most people then live their lives within these norms and allowthem to programme their sense of possibility, potential and who or what theyare. This is the eggshell and if people want to concede their uniqueness andinfinite power in this way, fine, go ahead. Couldn’t care less. But what happensis that those who live in these prisons are not satisfied with that. They insistthat everyone else does the same. It’s not enough for them to believe in areligion, they also seek to impose that belief on everyone else or condemn themif they do not accept that religion’s view of life. There would be no religiouswars if we respected each others’ right to believe whatever we choose, so longas we don’t impose it on anyone else. I don’t have a problem with people takingpart in Satanic ritual if everyone involved is making that choice while incomplete control of their own thinking processes. People want to sacrifice eachother and all involved have made a free choice? Go ahead, but please, someoneclear up the mess. Eventually they will learn from the experience and evolve toa higher level of understanding. If George Bush, Henry Kissinger, the Windsorsand the rest of the gang want to start a self-contained community and run it asa fascist state with everyone willingly taking part, please feel free. They’llhave no challenge from me. I’m interested when these things are imposed onpeople through secrecy and manipulation or by physical, mental or pharmaceuticalforce. Surely we can summon the maturity to think for ourselves and allow othersto do the same? Is that really too much to ask? If it is, we are in serioustrouble.The only way the few can control the world is if the masses help them to do it:and we do. I have spoken to audiences about freedom and had wild applause, butdo we understand what the word means? “Yes, freedom, that’s what we want!” Ohreally? Then why do many of these same people who wildly applaud the concept offreedom, insist that those who are not Christians are lesser human beings or theDevil incarnate? Why do they insist (the Muslims, Hindus and ‘Jews’, as well)that their children are brought up from birth to believe what they believe, atthe expense of other views and information? The times I have been asked atmeetings in America if I am a Christian, as if I become more credible andbelievable if I am. The very need to ask that question is confirmation that thequestioner is in mental servitude to a belief system of Brotherhood creation.And that’s the point. We are imprisoned by what we are manipulated to believe.The power of belief to entrap a mind is incredible. The Brotherhood do not carewhat you believe as long as you believe something to the exclusion of otherpossibilities. I am quite happy to change my views on any or all the informationin this book if that is where new information leads me. I am not attached to itbecause I am only seeking the truth, whatever it is. If it is somethingdifferent to what I think now, fine. So be it. Rigid beliefs defend themselvesfrom all comers because the belief becomes the person’s sense of self, theirsense of security, and so they would rather cling on to the belief than face themental and emotional challenge of letting it go. But we are now facing a time ofthe most phenomenal change in which all beliefs are going to crumble. You canwrite the future on a blank piece of paper far easier than one that is full ofold data. You can plant new flowers on an empty piece of garden far easier thanone still consumed by weeds. It is time to clear our minds of belief and be opento all possibility. Only then can we be free to tap into infinity.What I have detailed in this book is one level of the picture, the one whichmost directly affects people in human bodies today. But there are other levelsto consider also, and from that perspective the same events can look verydifferent. It is important to realise that two conflicting statements can bothbe equally true depending on the level from which you observe the samesituation. An example is to say on one hand that this world is imperfect and onthe other that everything that happens on the Earth is perfection. How can bothbe true? Well they are. From the perspective of everyday life, the world is notperfect. We have wars, hunger, disease, unhappiness and pain of all kinds.That’s true. But from the perspective of the evolution of humanity everything isperfect. That’s equally true. The only way we can evolve is by learning fromexperience and that means experiencing the consequences of our thoughts andactions. If there were no unpleasant consequences for our actions, how could wepossibly learn and evolve to higher levels of understanding? It would be like achild daubing paint all over the walls of your house or throwing stones throughyour windows. If the child did not face the consequences and see that suchbehaviour is deeply upsetting for the home owner, what would happen? The childwould go on daubing paint over other houses and smashing more windows. Humanityhas given its mind away all these thousands of years and if we are to regainthat power to consciously control our own destiny, we have to be kicked in thebackside by facing the consequences until, at last, the penny drops and thelight goes on. So we have the wars and conflicts and manipulations of all kinds.I don’t hate these reptilians. I want to love them because that is what theyneed so desperately. Their behaviour can only come from a lack of self-lovebecause only by loving yourself for what you are, can you begin to truly loveothers for what they are. So I love you Queen of England, Queen Mother, PrinceCharles, Prince Philip, Pindar, Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Edward Heath andall the rest. If these people would only love themselves this nightmare (andtheir nightmare) would be over. Until they do, their heart connection to theirinfinite soul (pure love) will remain closed and they will continue to manifestthese same attitudes and this behaviour. I would also stress again, before Ifinish, that when I talk of reptilians I am talking only of those who areseeking to manipulate humanity, not the species as a whole. Many of thereptilian species are trying to help us break the spell and even themanipulating reptilians are possessed by a fifth dimensional force. In the endwe’re all One, anyway.I know that many people who are aware of the Brotherhood and its Agenda feel theonly way to respond is by stockpiling weapons and preparing for an armed defenceof their liberties. I can’t think of a response more certain to bring about thevery fascist state they say they want to avoid. The idea of meeting violencewith violence is so obviously contradictory and so utterly devoid of thefaintest spark of intelligence, that one wonders how few brain cells must beactivated to conjure such a thought. When you meet violence with violence whatdo you get every time? Twice the violence. Yes, that’s going to make an enormouscontribution to peace. Also, when anyone uses violence against the system, itgives the Brotherhood a public excuse to use its high-tech weaponry to blow awaythe opposition in the name of the rule of ‘law’. I think we need to be just atouch more subtle than stockpiling weapons, somehow. I have met some of the moreextreme Christian patriots in the United States and as I said to one: “I don’tknow which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the oneyou want to replace it with”. This particular guy talked about freedom and theneed to defend it with armed resistance while claiming that black people weregenetically inferior to whites and that the Native Americans were only “lookingafter” the lands of America “until we (the whites) arrived”. He would have goton so well with his hero, the Founding Father Thomas Jefferson. But here we seethe theme again. People like this chap will, I’m sure, end up in armed conflictwith the Brotherhood forces at some point. Indeed it is inevitable unless hechanges his attitudes, because what will happen is that the two same states ofbeing under different names (the Brotherhood and the extreme Christian Patriots)will attract each other into their lives to play out their drama of mutualviolence. They both believe in the use of violence and so they are both in thesame frequency range. They may call themselves by different names, but they arenot opposites, they are oppo-sames. The confrontation has to happen for them toevolve and learn that violence solves nothing. Never has, never will. When youhear the Christian Patriots describe their alternative to the Brotherhood Agendathey say they want to have “One nation under God”. OK, but who’s version of God?The Christian God? The Muslim God? The Hindu God? The God as visualised by Ethelin New York or Bill in Los Angeles? No, they mean, of course, the Christian God,the vision of God that they believe in. They don’t actually want to replace theBrotherhood Agenda with freedom, but with their own version of dictatorship.Again, because both want to impose their will on others and suppress otherlifestyles and beliefs, they are bound to attract each other because they areoperating within the same frequency range. What is true of the extremeChristians is equally true of the extreme Muslims, Hindus, Jews and otherreligions. To an extent the same was true of the Native Americans when the whiteEuropeans came. The Native American culture contains some tremendous wisdom andhas a far greater understanding of the connection of all things. But let’s notgo overboard here as so many in the New Age Movement often do with theirstarry-eyed vision of Native America. Before the whites came scores of NativeAmerican tribes used to war with each other simply because they were indifferent tribes. There was much slaughter and conflict. Such a macho, war-paintmentality will attract into its life another energy that equally thinks thatviolence is justified. Whenever you have two groups who think violence is anoption they are a vibrational confrontation waiting to happen.Fortunately many Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Native Americans are notextreme and there is an alternative to violence. We can either learn from thehardest and most painful of experience or we can use our intelligence and ourlove to observe this situation and change our state of being without a gun beingfired. Then these confrontations will be avoided because there will novibrational attraction between the Brotherhood and those who wish to scuppertheir Agenda. We can do it without confrontation. The reptilian vibrationalconnection to humanity is through the emotion of fear. They are themselvesconsumed by fear which is why they behave as they do. If they can manipulatehumanity into a state of fear, as they have, they make the vibrationalconnection which allows them to control the human psyche. They are also playingat home, you might say, because they are experts on the emotion of fear. Thisreptilian group are the very expression of it. If we seek to stop thereptilian-Brotherhood with a confrontation on their home ground of fear by usinghatred, aggression and violence, then forget it. The game is already over. Butif we meet this challenge from a frequency range the Brotherhood cannot evenconceive of – love – we will transform the world and the reptilian control willbe no more. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, when we open our hearts tolove, the heart chakra spins with tremendous speed and power, whipping up thefrequency of our incarnate consciousness to the highest vibrational expressionof life, pure love. As our soul is pure love, we reconnect with the awesomepower of our multidimensional self (see Figure 63). The eggshell explodes.The fast, short, wavelength of love also activates the ‘antenna’ in our DNAwhich reconnects us with the cosmos and an open heart chakra tunes into thecosmic pulse from the Earth, the Sun and the centre of the Galaxy, and transmitsthat changing drumbeat to our brain and every cell in our bodies. This willdramatically transform our minds, emotions and physical form as they synchronisewith the quickening vibrations at this time of unbelievable change andevolution. The subsequent leap in our personal frequencies will lift us out ofthe vibrational pit of fear and onto levels far beyond the lower fourthdimension. The reptilian control will be over because they will be on adifferent radio station, if you like, and they will have to face theconsequences of their own actions on their road to enlightenment. The choice isours, fear or love, prison or freedom.If the reptilians did not exist we would have to invent them because theircurrent state of being represents something that human consciousness had toexperience. If that was not so, the reptilians would be manipulating someoneelse. We would not have attracted them. They have given us a gift in our eternalevolution, a gift of experiencing the consequences of fear and of conceding ourinfinite power to another force, be it a parent, boss, peer pressure, or,ultimately, the reptilian-Brotherhood. The evolutionary process is about love,not punishment. It does not punish us for our actions, it gives us theconsequences of them, which is very different. Without that we cannot evolve. Weare loved along this journey by consciousness levels (other aspects of self)which seek to help us to become more loving and more enlightened, to be mastersof ourselves. Our choice is how much of this experience we need before we learnand move on. Are we going to change now or do we require more wars, hunger, andsuffering, before the light bulb flashes? Are we going to walk through thefast-approaching gateway to a whole new state of being? Or are we going to staywhere we are and face another cycle of incarnation and reincarnation untilanother opportunity comes? The reptilian group I have highlighted are deeplyimbalanced because they are disconnected from those levels of self whichresonate to the rhythm of love. But they are still part of everything thatexists, they are still you and me, an aspect of the glorious whole we call God.So if we hate them, we hate ourselves. If we are violent to them, we are violentto ourselves. And it would be all so self defeating. I say: forgive them forthey know not what they do. By forgive and by love, I don’t mean to walk awayand let them get on with it. They are seeking to impose their will and thereforethere is a legitimate cause for a challenge to that. But if this Brotherhoodcontrol is caused by giving our minds, power and responsibility away, and byinsisting that others do the same, it is ourselves we need to address, not onlythe behaviour of the reptilians. If we take back our power and set ourselves andeach other free from imposition of thought, belief and lifestyle, it doesn’tmatter what the Brotherhood do. Control from the centre will be impossiblebecause you cannot centralise control of diversity, only uniformity. Threethings will transform life on Earth and remove the reptilian control of thehuman psyche:[../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 63: When people are conditioned to close down their consciousness theydelink from their eternal soul and all the love, wisdom, knowledge andinspiration waiting to be tapped. It is not that we need to seek enlightenment –we are enlightened. We just need to remove the barriers of fear which disconnectus from our own enlightenment outside the ‘egg shell’. 1. 1 We let go of our fear of what other people think of us and we express our uniqueness of view and lifestyle, even (no, especially) if it differs from the ‘norm’. At this point we cease to be a sheep following the flock. 2. 2 We allow everyone else to do the same without fear of being ridiculed or condemned for the crime of being different. When we do this we cease to be the sheep dog for the rest of the flock, pressuring them to conform to what we believe is right. 3. 3 No-one seeks to impose what they believe on anyone else, so always respecting free will and free choice.There is no way the Brotherhood Agenda can survive such changes in attitude.People ask me what they should do in response to my information, but I neveranswer that question. The only person who knows what is best for you, is you.The trick is to clear the channel to your higher dimensions so you can connectwith the highest level of your wisdom, love and inspiration to guide you to dowhat is most appropriate for you. We don’t need to sit around in smoke filledrooms or start new political parties. We need to remove the egg shell of lowvibrational emotion – fear – and the law of vibrational attraction will connectus with all the people and organisations we need to transform the planet. Whenwe get ourselves right, the world must come right because we are the world andthe world is us. What we call society is the sum total of human thinking andfeeling. It is a reflection of our attitudes. When we change them, we changesociety. We are only a change of mind away from real freedom, the freedom toexpress our God-given uniqueness and celebrate the diversity of gifts,perceptions and inspiration that exist within the collective human psyche. Thecreative force is within us all and desperate to express itself. It is thesuppression of this energy which leads to so much pent-up frustration andtherefore violence and depression. Imagine you are a gifted artist or dancer,but peer pressure, parent pressure and the demands of the system insist that youwork in a bank or sit next to a factory machine all day. Or you want to expressyour creativity and make a contribution to the world, but the Brotherhoodmanipulation of the financial system means that you can’t find a job. Thatall-powerful creative force within you cannot be suppressed, so it comes out inan imbalanced way, impregnated with the vibration of anger, despair orfrustration, and so we have violence and the demand for drugs and alcohol toshut off the emotional pain. If we respected the value of all creativity andsought ways of allowing it to be expressed, these things would not happen on thescale that they do. Instead we demand that such creativity must ‘pay for itself’or contribute to the economy – the Brotherhood’s economy. We know the price ofeverything and the value of nothing. If, however, we could open our hearts to agreater vision of possibility, we would unleash the creative force in everyoneand allow it to express its uniqueness. What a world of incredible diversity andinspiration we would then experience. A world guided by the flow of the creativeforce and not by the profit demands of the Brotherhood bankers.I talked at the start of the book about thinking the unthinkable. Theinformation here has challenged you to do that. To consider the evidence thatreptilians on another dimension of existence have manipulated humanity forthousands of years. To consider that far from being ordinary and powerless, youare extraordinary and all powerful. Both are unthinkable for most people giventhe current level of conditioning. But they are not unfeelable. There is such adifference. You think with your intellect and that is so vulnerable toprogramming through the eyes and ears by the daily diet of lies, suppression andmisrepresentation in the media and by all those Brotherhood clones to which itoffers a platform. But when we feel, we are tapping into our heart centre, ourintuition, that connection with the cosmos. How often has what you think andwhat you instinctively feel been in conflict? What transformed my life more thananything was the moment I decided to follow my intuition whenever it was at oddswith my intellect. Every time I have done this, my intuition has turned out tobe correct. It can be challenging and painful sometimes because your intuition,which is unbounded by the need to follow ‘norms’, often stands out againstconvention. But it will always lead you to do what is best for you and youreternal journey of evolution through experience. For most people when theyinstinctively feel to do something, the chatterbox mind begins to list all thereasons why they should not do it. “You can’t do that, what will the neighbourssay, or your family, the people at work, and the guys down the bar?”… ”You can’tdo that, you’ve got a mortgage, a car, a family, and the life insurance policiesto pay for.”… ”You can’t, you can’t, you can’t.” But you can, you can, you CAN.There is nothing wrong with the intellect. It keeps you grounded, stores andprocesses this-world information, and it has an important part to play. It iswhen it becomes our controlling force and sole decision-maker that we findourselves in the prison of the mind. The intellect is there to make physical theguidance and inspiration of the intuition, not to dictate the odds. Don’t workfor your mind, make your mind work for you.So it’s not what you think about the information in this book that matters, itis what you feel about it. Some of the content will challenge your intellect tobreaking point, but your intuition will have no such problem. To that level ofyou, it either feels right, or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, walk away. I am nottrying to ‘convert’ anyone to a belief. I could not care less what you think orfeel about me and my work. But I care passionately about your right to hear whatis currently being denied to you. How you react to it is none of my business,let alone my concern. You are, however, going to see unfolding before your eyesin your every day experience, the Agenda I have described. You will never watcha news bulletin, read a paper, or hear a political or economic announcement, inthe same way again. You will also see the weather changes advancing andstaggering geological events as the transformation of the Earth’s energy fieldscontinues apace. You will feel the gathering vibrations in your heart and yourmind. Your rapidly changing perception of life and yourself will open you tounimaginable possibility and potential. Thinking the unthinkable will become away of life for those who grasp this opportunity to reconnect with all thatexists. There are many who will consider this book negative, but they havemisunderstood what is happening here. This information is rising to the surfaceafter thousands of years at the same time that more and more people are wakingup to who they really are. The same vibrational changes are responsible forboth. There is a healing going on and for the healing to start the cause of thedisease has to be addressed. The rising frequency is bringing to the surface allthat has remained hidden, collectively and individually, to allow the healing tobegin. This is why people who have opened up to the changing cosmic rhythm havefound that all hell breaks loose in their lives at first. Relationships breakup, jobs are lost, family and people they considered friends walk away. Thereare many different experiences that people have. With me it was massive publicridicule because I never do anything by halves. You can think you have made amonumental mistake at the time, but quite the opposite is happening. We createour own reality and control our own destiny and the way we do that isoverwhelmingly through our intent. So often people have said to me that nothingever happens in their lives and nothing ever seems to work. But when I ask themwhat they really want to do they reply: “I don’t know, really.” Well if that istheir state of being, their physical experience will reflect “I don’t knowreally”, and nothing of significance will happen. If, instead, you focus yourintent on a specific goal, what you need to do to achieve it will always cometowards you as one vibrational pattern attracts reflections of itself in people,experiences and opportunities. This is where the journey ends for most people.When they are faced with what they need to do to achieve their goal, theysuddenly think that perhaps it wasn’t such a good idea after all! And that’s thequestion. You say you want something? OK, but how badly? Just a little bit?Fine, then don’t waste your time. With every fibre of your being? Well, go forit because the world is yours.I have seen countless people say they want to transform themselves and theirlives and tune into the new vibration. But when the challenges have come, whichare necessary to make that happen, they want out immediately and go back to lifeas before. Yet these challenges set us free. The reason we face personal andemotional mayhem when we start this journey is because of the need to clean outour emotional cesspit of suppressed and unprocessed emotional debris that wehave pushed deep into our subconscious because we don’t want to deal with it. Ifwe don’t clear the emotional gunge of this and other physical lifetimes, wecan’t reconnect with our multidimensional self. We can’t be free of thereptilian manipulation and control from the lower fourth dimension. So when wesay we intend to transform, that intent draws to us the people and experiencesnecessary to bring that suppressed emotion to the surface where we can see itand deal with it. The same is happening collectively as the informationpresented in this book comes into the light of public attention, so we can seeit, address it and heal it. Much of the New Age is in denial of this collectivecesspit because it doesn’t want to face its own personal cesspit. It wouldrather sit around a candle and kid itself it is enlightened while, in fact, itis an emotional wreck with a crystal in its hand. The information in this bookis part of the healing of Planet Earth and the human consciousness as the veillifts on all that has remained hidden and denied.Hey, this is a wonderful time we’re living through here. We are tuning to thecosmic dance, the wind of change, the rhythm of reconnection with all that is,has been, or ever will be. You have come to make a difference, for yourself andfor the world. You have the opportunity to do that now, now, now. Grasp it andlet’s end this nonsense. A few can only control billions because the billionslet it happen. We don’t have to. And we can change it just by being ourselves,allowing other people to be themselves, and enjoying the gift of life. This isnot a time to fear and it’s not a time to hide. It is a time to sing and a timeto dance.Take your partners, please. Let’s go!"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX I [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos9937]The Windsor-Bush bloodlineThe Elite bloodlines go way back into the ancient world, to the ‘gods’ and theextraterrestrial-human hybrids who ruled Sumer, Egypt, Babylon and Greece. Theyinclude the pharaohs of Egypt back to 1550 BC and beyond, and include Ramses II(1295-1228 BC), who is considered perhaps the greatest pharaoh of all. He washis country’s master architect (sacred geometry) and his name can be found onalmost every ancient shrine. The gold mines of Nubia made him rich beyondimagination.Some of the common foundations of the bloodline I have termed (Ramses-Piso-Bush)are Philip of Macedonia (382-336 BC), who married Olympias, and their son wasAlexander the Great (356-323 BC), a tyrant who plundered that key region ofGreece, Persia, Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon, the former lands of Sumer andacross into India before dying in Babylon at the age of 33. During his rule ofEgypt he founded the city of Alexandria and Alexander was taught by thelegendary Greek philosopher, Aristotle, a pupil of Plato. The bloodline and theknowledge go through history together. This key bloodline comes down through themost famous Egyptian queen, Cleopatra (60-30 BC), who married the most famousRoman Emperor, Julius Caesar, and bore him a son, who became Ptolemy XIV. Shealso bore twins with Mark Anthony, who has his own genetic connections to thisline and it’s many offshoots. The bloodline also connects to Herod the Great,the ‘Herod’ of the Jesus stories, and continues to the Piso family who wrote theoriginal Gospel stories about Jesus! The same line includes Constantine theGreat, the Roman Emperor, who in 325 AD turned Christianity, based on hisancestors’ stories, into the religion we know today. The Pisos later providedsome of the early Popes! It then moves further up into Europe through Meroveusor Merovee, who gave his name to the Merovingian bloodline, and it continueswith the rest of the Merovingian clan like Clovis and the Dagoberts who connectinto the Priory of Sion and the Rennes-le-Chateau ‘mystery’ in Provence,Southern France.From the Merovingians, this bloodline’s connections to the present day include:Charlemagne (742-814), who ruled as Emperor of the West in the Holy RomanEmpire; a stream of French kings, including Robert Ist, Robert II, Philip Ist,II and III, and Louis Ist, II, VI, VII, VIII, VIIII, XIII, IX, XV and XVI. Thelatter married Marie Antoinette of this same bloodline and both were executed inthe French Revolution. But they produced the son who became Daniel Payseur, thesecret force behind financial and industrial ‘giants’ like Carnegie and Morgan.This bloodline also connects to the de Medici family, sponsors of ChristopherColumbus, and the artist Leonardo da Vinci, a Grand Master of the Priory ofSion. Catherine de Medici, the Queen of France who died in 1589, employedNostradamus as her doctor. Rene d’Anjou, Duke of Lorraine, and the House ofLorraine, which employed Nostradamus and Columbus, are of this bloodline. So wasGeoffrey Plantagenet and their royal dynasty in England; King John, who signedthe Magna Carta; King Henry Ist, II and III; Mary Stuart and the Stuart Dynasty,including King James Ist of England, sponsor of the King James version of theBible. The line of James, according to the genealogy sources listed below, canbe traced back to 1550 BC and beyond and includes many Egyptian Pharoahs, amongthem Ramses II. The bloodline includes King George Ist, II and III; Edward Ist,II and III, Queen Victoria; Edward VII; George V and VI; the present QueenMother; Queen Elizabeth II; Prince Charles and Elizabeth’s other offspring,Anne, Andrew and Edward; Princes William and Harry from Charles’ ‘marriage’ toPrincess Diana; US Presidents, George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams,Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George Bush; it goes on to theyear 2000 presidential favourite, George W. Bush and his brother Jeb Bush, theGovernor of Florida. In fact if you go deeply enough into the genealogicalresearch you will find that all the presidents are from this line. Thirty-threeof them are the line of Charlemagne and 19 are related to England’s Edward III,both of whom are of this bloodline. It also includes key Scottish families likethe Lords of Galloway and the Comyns; Marie-Louise of Austria, who marriedNapoleon Bonaparte; Kaiser Wilhelm II, the king of Germany at the time of theFirst World War; the Habsburgs, the most powerful family in Europe during theHoly Roman Empire, and Maximillian, the Habsburg emperor of Mexico, who died in1867. This same bloodline can be traced to King Priam of Troy and both sides inthe Trojan Wars; to the rulers of ancient Crete, and to every surviving royalfamily in Europe, including King Juan Carlos of Spain. Joseph Smith and BrighamYoung, founders of the Mormons, came from this bloodline. So did Charles TazeRussell, who created the Jehovah’s Witness ‘religion’.And this is just one of the reptilian bloodlines and some of its offshoots.There are others which connect with these names and span the same period andbeyond to thousands of years BC.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Detailed family trees of the above are available on the internet on the PisoHomepage: http://www.widomaker.com/~piso/ [http://www.widomaker.com/~piso/] –you can also access the relevant page through my website: www.davidicke.com[http://www.davidicke.com].

It became known as Rothschild (red-shield or rotes-schild in German),in the 18th century when a financial dynasty was founded in Frankfurt by MayerAmschel Rothschild working in league with the Illuminati House of Hesse andothers. They took their name from the red shield or hexagram/Star of David onthe front of their house in Frankfurt. The Star of David or Seal of Solomon isan ancient esoteric symbol and only became associated with Jewish people afterthe Rothschilds adopted it for themselves. It has absolutely no connection toDavid or Solomon, as Jewish historical sources confirm. The Rothschilds are oneof the top Illuminati bloodlines on the planet and they are shape-shiftingreptilians.Already I can hear the clamor gathering to condemn me as “anti-semitic” becausethe Rothschilds claim to be Jewish. Organisations like the Anti-DefamationLeague and B’nai B’rith have already made strenuous efforts to label me in thisway for exposing the Rothschilds and to stop me speaking in public. (See mywebsite.) How funny then that both organisations were created by, and continueto be bankrolled by, the Rothschilds. Just a coincidence, nothing to worryabout. B’nai B’rith means, appropriately, Sons of the Alliance, and wasestablished by the Rothschilds in 1843 as an intelligence arm and to defame anddestroy legitimate researchers with the label “anti-semitic”. Many of theirspeakers openly supported slavery during the American Civil War and today theyseek to condemn some black leaders as antisemitic or racist! Every year, theAnti-Defamation League award their Torch of Liberty (the classic Illuminatisymbol) to the person they believe has served their cause the most. One yearthey gave it to Morris Dalitz, an intimate of the notorious Meyer Lansky crimesyndicate which terrorised America. Perfect choice.Of course, the strength of feeling that fans the flames of condemnation againstanyone dubbed anti-semitic today, is the sickening persecution of Jewish peopleby the Nazis of Adolf Hitler. To expose or question the actions of theRothschilds or any other Jewish person or organisation, is to be called a “nazi”and “anti-semitic”, that all-encompassing label which has discredited so manyresearchers and stopped them having the opportunity to speak in public becauseof protest by unthinking robot radicals, and the refusal of venues to host theirmeetings. I have had this from time to time, not least in eastern Canada thanksto a campaign by B’nai B’rith and the Anti-Defamation League (which spends itsentire time trying to defame people). Both organisations, I repeat, areRothschild created and controlled.How strange then, that as I have documented in …And The Truth Shall Set You Freeand The Biggest Secret, along with endless other researchers and scholars, AdolfHitler and the Nazis were created and funded by – the Rothschilds. It was theywho arranged for Hitler to come to power through the Illuminati secret societiesin Germany, like the Thule Society and the Vril Society which they createdthrough their German networks; it was the Rothschilds who funded Hitler throughthe Bank of England and other British and American sources like the Rothschild’sKuhn, Loeb bank which also funded the Russian Revolution.The very heart of Hitler’s war machine was the chemical giant, I.G. Farben,which had an American arm that was controlled by the Rothschilds through theirlackeys, the Warburgs. Paul Warburg, who in 1913 manipulated into existence theprivately-owned ‘central bank’ of America, the Federal Reserve, was on the boardof American I.G. Indeed Hitler’s I.G. Farben, which ran the slave labour camp atAuchwitz, was in reality a division of Standard Oil, officially owned by theRockefellers, but in truth the Rockefeller empire was funded into existence by –the Rothschilds. See …And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the detailedbackground of this and other aspects of this story. The Rothschilds also ownedthe German news agencies during both World Wars and thus controlled the flow of‘information’ to Germans and the outside world. Incidentally, when Allied troopsentered Germany they found that the I.G. Farben factories, the very core ofHitler’s war operation, had not been hit by the mass bombing and neither hadFord factories – another Illuminati supporter of Hitler. Other factories nearbyhad been demolished by bombing raids.So the force behind Adolf Hitler, on behalf of the Illuminati, was the House ofRothschild, this ‘Jewish’ bloodline which claims to support and protect theJewish faith and people. In fact they use, and sickeningly abuse, the Jewishpeople for their own horrific ends. The Rothschilds, like the Illuminati ingeneral, treat the mass of the Jewish people with utter contempt. They are, likethe rest of the global population, just cattle to be used to advance the agendaof global control and mastery by a network of interbreeding bloodlines,impregnated with a reptilian genetic code, and known to researchers as theIlluminati.Indeed, the Illuminati are so utterly obsessed with bloodline, because of thisreptilian genetic code, that there was no way that someone like Hitler wouldcome to power in those vital circumstances for the Illuminati, unless he was ofthe reptilian bloodline. If you look at Appendix I you will see how the samebloodline has held the positions of royal, aristocratic, financial, political,military and media power in the world for literally thousands of years. This isthe bloodline that has produced all 42 of the Presidents of the United Statessince, and including, George Washington in 1789. It is the bloodline of therunaway favourite to win the 2000 election, George W Bush. The World War Twoleaders, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, were of the bloodline and alsoFreemasons and Satanists. They were manipulated into office, and their country’swar efforts funded by the Rothschilds and the other Illuminati bloodlines.So are we to believe, therefore, that although this same group provably fundedAdolf Hitler’s rise to power and his war machine, that he would be the odd oneout, a leader of crucial importance to the agenda who was not bloodline? Buthold on. Hitler couldn’t be the same bloodline as, say, the Rothschilds because,as we all know, the Rothschilds are defenders of Jewish people and Hitlerslaughtered them, along with communists and gypsies and others who opposed himor that he wanted to eliminate. The Rothschilds are Jewish, they’d never dothat.Oh, really.According to researchers and insiders, not only was Hitler supported by theRothschilds, he was a Rothschild. This revelation fits like a glove with theactions of the Rothschilds and the other Illuminati bloodlines in Germany whobrought Hitler to the fore as dictator of that nation. He was also supported bythe British Royal Family, the House of Windsor (in truth the German House ofSaxe-Coburg-Gotha), and these included the British royal ‘war hero’, LordMountbatten, a Rothschild and a Satanist. Their royal relatives in Germany, whoyou would never have thought would normally support an apparent guy from thestreet like Hitler, were among his most enthusiastic supporters. But, of course,they knew who he really was. There is no way in the world when you do any studyof the Illuminati obsession with bloodline that Hitler would not have been oneof them. The psychoanalyst Walter Langer wrote in his book, The Mind Of Hitler:“Adolf’s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria AnnaSchicklgruber. It was generally supposed that the father of Alois Hitler(Schicklgruber) was Johann Georg Hiedler. There are some people who seriouslydoubt that Johann Georg Hiedler was the father of Alois – an Austrian documentwas prepared that proved Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at thetime she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the home ofBaron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sentback home… where Alois was born.”Langer’s information came from the high level Gestapo officer, HansjurgenKoehler, published in 1940, under the title Inside The Gestapo. He writes aboutthe investigations into Hitler’s background carried out by the AustrianChancellor, Dolfuss, in the family files of Hitler. Koehler actually viewed acopy of the Dolfuss documents which were given to him by Heydrich, the overlordof the Nazi Secret Service. The file, Koehler wrote, “caused such havoc as nofile in the world ever caused before”. He also revealed that:“…The second bundle in the blue file contained the documents collected byDolfuss. The small statured, but big-hearted Austrian Chancellor must have knownby such a personal file he might be able to check Hitler. His task was notdifficult; as ruler of Austria he could easily find out about the personal dataand family of Adolf Hitler, who had been born on Austrian soil… Through theoriginal birth certificates, police registration cards, protocols, etc, allcontained in the original file, the Austrian Chancellor succeeded in piecingtogether the disjointed parts of the puzzle, creating a more or less logicalentity…“A little servant girl – Hitler’s mother – came to Vienna and became a domesticservant, mostly working for rather rich families. But she was unlucky; havingbeen seduced, she was about to bear a child. She went home to her village forher confinement. Where was the little maid serving in Vienna? This was not avery difficult problem. Very early Vienna had instituted the system ofcompulsory police registration. Both servants and the employers were exposed toheavy fines if they neglected this duty. Chancellor Dolfuss managed to discoverthe registration card. The little, innocent maid had been a servant at theRothschild mansion… and Hitler’s unknown grandfather must be probably looked forin this magnificent house. The Dolfuss file stopped at this statement.”Was Hitler’s determination to take over Austria anything to do with his desireto destroy records of his lineage? A correspondent to my website who hasextensively researched this subject writes:“It appears to me that Hitler knew about his connection long before hisChancellorship. Like his father before him, when the going got rough, theHitlers went to Vienna. Hitler’s father left his home village at an early age toseek his fortune in Vienna. When Hitler was orphaned after his mother died inDecember of 1907, he left for Vienna not long after the funeral. There he seemedto drop out of sight for ten months! What happened during this ten-month stay inVienna is a complete mystery on which history sheds no light. It makes sense,now that it has become established that Hitler was a Rothschild, that he and hiscousins were getting aquainted, and his potential for future family endeavorswas being sized up.”The Rothschilds and the Illuminati produce many offspring out of wedlock intheir secret breeding programmes and these children are brought up under othernames with other parents. Like Bill Clinton, who is almost certainly aRockefeller produced in the same way, these “ordinary kids from ordinarybackgrounds” go on to be extraordinarily successful in their chosen field.Hitler, too, would have produced unofficial children to maintain his strand ofthe bloodline and there will obviously be people of his bloodline alive today.So which Rothschild was the grandfather of Hitler? Alois, Hitler’s father, wasborn in 1837 in the period when Salomon Mayer was the only Rothschild who livedat the Vienna mansion. Even his wife did not live there because their marriagewas so bad that she stayed in Frankfurt. Their son, Anselm Salomon spent most ofhis working life in Paris and Frankfurt away from Vienna and his father.Father Salomon Mayer, living alone at the Vienna mansion where Hitler’s motherworked, is the prime, most obvious candidate. And Hermann von Goldschmidt, theson of Salomon Mayer’s senior clerk, wrote a book, published in 1917, which saidof Salomon: “…by the 1840s he had developed a somewhat reckless enthusiasm foryoung girls…” and “He had a lecherous passion for very young girls, hisadventures with whom had to be hushed up by the police”.And Hitler’s mother, a young girl working under the same roof would not havebeen the subject of Salomon’s desire? And this same girl became pregnant whileworking there? And her grandson becomes the Chancellor of Germany, funded by theRothschilds, and he started the Second World War which was so vital to theRothschild-Illuminati agenda? And the Illuminati are obsessed with putting theirbloodlines into power on all ‘sides’ in a conflict? And the Rothschilds are oneof their most key bloodlines? And it is all a coincidence?Hitler was a Rothschild!"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY [../Text/index_split_005.html#filepos10286]Alder, The Battle Of The Trees (Freedom House, Crete, Greece, 1995).Allen, D.
