The publishers of my earlier books refused to even contemplate thepublication of this one because of the names it named and because the agenda forglobal dictatorship that it reveals was far beyond the absorption or credibilitythreshold of their ‘New Age’ minds.The horizon was filled with disappearing backsides and clouds of dust, and, forall I know, they may still be running. Or, given how successful this book andsubsequent ones have been, maybe they have learned a big, big lesson. Runningaway from things we don’t want to face is never the answer. It just delays,often briefly, removing the control of that which we fear.Either way, to publish this book originally I had to borrow £15,000 from afriend in Liverpool, David Solomon, and set up a company called Bridge of LovePublications to publish what no-one else would. I also called on the help ofothers who had ‘coincidently’ come into my life in the weeks before – AliceFerguson, artist Neil Hague and book designer, Sam Masters, who has designed allthe books that have followed.It was a challenge to do it all from scratch, but what satisfaction it hasbrought with the years. In terms of the ‘this world’ level of the globalconspiracy it is still the most important book I have written and will probablycontinue to be so until the day I leave this realm of manipulated illusion.In the decade that has followed, the themes and predictions of And The Truthhave proved to mirror the events that have unfolded across the world. This hasincluded the blatant use of ‘Modified Hegelianism’, or‘problem-reaction-solution’ as I call it, to covertly create a problem to whichthe authorities can openly offer a ‘solution’ – changes in society to advancethe global Big Brother, fascist state, that, without the ‘problem,’ would berejected by the public. The horrific attacks of September 11th were a classicexample of this with the attacks (problem) leading to the response of ‘somethingmust be done’ (reaction) that has allowed the destruction of basic freedoms,rights and privacy and the launch of the thoroughly bogus ‘war on terrorism’(solution). See Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster for thedetailed background.You will see as you read this book that in the mid-1990s the force behind 21stcentury events was exposed in great detail, as was the agenda it was following.Therefore, predicting then what is happening now did not require a ‘prophet’ –merely the dedicated study and exposure of the network that controls thegovernments, banking system, global corporations, military decision making andownership of the media.Today, thanks to the work of dedicated researchers, vastly more people arebecoming aware of the global conspiracy than were in those lonely days when AndThe Truth was first published; and if I had to name the achievements in my lifeof which I am most proud, this book would be very close to the top.David IckeRyde,Isle of WightJuly 2004"},{"pageContent":"introductionwe are what we thinkWe live in a multidimensional universe, which is part of a multidimensional andinfinite consciousness we call God and Creation. We are multidimensional beings.Therefore this book has to be multidimensional if it is to make a significantcontribution to human freedom.It exposes both the daily manipulation of our lives by a secret clique andpresents the spiritual causes and solutions which will bring true freedom toPlanet Earth and all who live upon her. The latter relates to what we think andfeel about ourselves and before I begin to unravel the global manipulation andname some of the people and organisations involved, it is important that Ioutline the context in which I am presenting these matters. The last thing Iwant is for people to read this book full of anger, hatred, and condemnation forthe global manipulators and what they are doing. I don’t write this book toapportion blame, merely to show what happens when the human race gives its mindaway and how rapidly things will change – are changing – as we take it backagain.I name names because we need to know who is behind the manipulation if we aregoing to expose what is happening. This exposure will also give those people theopportunity to face their actions and to see that the desire for control anddomination of others is an expression of their own deep inner imbalances anddislike of themselves. The lifting of the veil of secrecy will speed the momentwhen the days of such domination and manipulation are over. But the elite cliquewhich controls the world, the Global Elite as I call them, are our creation. Itis no good hurling hatred and condemnation in their direction for the ills ofthe world. Yes, as you will see, the same grouping manipulated the two worldwars and all the negative events of global significance in this century andbefore. But without the rest of the human race, they could not do this. An elitefew cannot create wars unless thousands or millions are willing to be used ascannon fodder. If people read this book and hand the responsibility for what hashappened only to the Global Elite, they are missing the point I am makingthroughout. What is happening in the world is the here and now reflection ofwhat is going on inside us, the human race. We created this reality. But how?Contrary to what medical science is obsessed with telling us, the physical bodyis not the whole human being. It is the fantastic physical shell through whichthe eternal us experiences this physical world. There is far more to us than abody. Creation is the expression of one infinite mind and all lifeforms areaspects of that one mind: what many people call God. We are each other. We areall God, if you wish to use that term. At the heart of this mind is aconsciousness I see as a blinding light – the Source Consciousness from whichall has been thought into existence. Creation consists of an infinite number ofdimensions, wavelengths, frequencies, of reality. This physical world is onlyone of them. These frequencies share the same space that our physical worldoccupies, in the same way that all the radio, television, and telecommunicationfrequencies broadcasting to your area are sharing the same space that your bodyis occupying now. They don’t interfere with each other because they are ondifferent frequencies or dimensions; they are vibrating at different speeds. Atthe moment we call death, our mind-emotions-spirit, everything that is thethinking, feeling us, withdraws from the body, the ‘genetic space suit’ as Icall it. This eternal spirit moves on to another wavelength of reality, another‘world’, to continue its evolution. This is all that is happening during a ‘neardeath experience’ or an ‘out of body experience’ when people leave theirphysical bodies for a time before returning to tell remarkably similar storiesof what happened to them. Life is forever – for everyone.Our mental, emotional, and spiritual selves are a series of magnetic energyfields interacting with each other via vortices of energy widely known by theHindu and Sanskrit word, chakra, which means wheel of light. These vortices arespirals of energy which intersect all levels of our being and pass energiesbetween them. It is through this system that an imbalance on the emotionallevel, perhaps caused by stress, is passed on to the other levels of our being,including, eventually, the physical body. This is how stress causes illness.What we call ‘physical’ illness is really a multidimensional disharmony ordis-ease. We are constantly absorbing magnetic energy from the cosmos, mostlythrough the ‘base’ chakra at the base of the spine. After this lifeforce haspassed through our levels of being and we have taken from it what we need, webroadcast the energy out through the chakras back to the cosmos and the worldaround us (Figure 1). These are the energies that people are feeling when theysay that someone gives them good or bad ‘vibes’. It is the same when we say ahouse or place feels ‘happy’, ‘welcoming’ or ‘frightening’. What we call‘atmosphere’ is created by the vibrations (energy fields) generated by people,either in the moment or in the past. People often feel uneasy at the scenes ofbattles because they are feeling the energies left there by the pain,aggression, and suffering of those involved.There is a vital difference between the energy that enters through the basechakra and that which we broadcast. That energy is changed in its nature andform when it passes through us. It becomes imprinted with our unique energypattern and that pattern reflects precisely what is happening inside us at thatmoment, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Second by second we arebroadcasting an energy field that reflects what we think of ourselves. This maynot seem to have anything to do with the manipulation of the world, but it is,in fact, at the core of what has happened and continues to happen.You might imagine this process as like casting a magnetic cape or aura aroundourselves. Under the law of like attracts like, this magnetic energy field, theouter reflection of the inner person, will attract to it compatible energyfields. Everything is energy, as even mainstream, closed minded science isbeginning to appreciate. A person is a series of magnetic energy fields, so is aplace, an experience, a situation, everything. Life is the interaction of theseenergy fields, all of which have the ability to think and retain information.Energy is consciousness, consciousness is energy. They are the same thing. If itsounds hard to believe that a wall or water or rock can think and retaininformation, then remember that all contain magnetic energy fields. What is itwithin the computer I am working on now that retains the information I amwriting? A magnetic disc. Same principle. The reason we are drawn to particularpeople, places, experiences and ways of life is because we are magneticallyattracted to them. And that attraction comes from the magnetism of our ‘capes’.These capes, in turn, are a reflection of what we think and feel aboutourselves. Our lives are an exact physical replica of our own subconscious mind.How it thinks and perceives itself and the world, is recreated physically in thepeople, places and experiences we attract to us. When I was a child, there usedto be a saying which went: “Think lucky and you’ll be lucky”. This contains aneternal truth, although it has nothing to do with luck. We attract to us people,places, and experiences which connect magnetically with our ‘cape’. Therefore ifwe believe inside that we will always be poor and downtrodden, that pattern willbe contained in the cape. It will become, you could say, the cape of no hope.This magnetic pattern will then attract to it the experiences which ensure thatwe remain poor and downtrodden. We will have created our own reality. This isso, so vital to understand, not only in relation to this book, but in thecontext of life itself:[../Images/00006.jpg]Figure 1: the magnetic cape> > We create our own reality.Religions and ancient texts going way back have had a common theme of ‘reapingwhat you sow’, ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’, and ‘what you do toothers will be done to you’. The word by which this process is now best known is‘karma’. Too often this karma is seen in only negative terms. Somethingunpleasant happens to some people and they say it must be their ‘karma’. It ispresented as almost a form of punishment. At that level, it is punishment – selfpunishment. We created it, not some angry, judgmental, finger-wagging God! Whatwe call karma is, in my view, only another word to describe the way we createour own reality. If we have imbalances that lead us to act negatively towardsothers, it is those imbalances that will also attract to us a physicalexperience, a ‘mirror’ of what we think of ourselves. In this way what we do toothers will come back to us because we will still be holding onto theimbalances, the lack of self love, that will attract those experiences. If wefeel good about ourselves and have a positive view of our lives we will createthat world around us. This is positive ‘karma’. I differ from the New Age viewof karma which seems to believe that once we have done something, there must bea karmic reaction no matter what we subsequently do. I feel that if we actnegatively towards someone, recognise why we did it, and change the inner causeof that action, we change the nature of the magnetic broadcast, the cape, and wedo not then attract the ‘karma’. There is no need because we have recognised theimbalance within us. That’s all karma is there for. Creation is about love. Lovefor self and love for all. Karma is part of that love. It is a vehicle whichallows us to face ourselves, unload negative baggage, and move on. It is an aidto evolution, a gift, not a punishment – unless we ourselves decide to make itso. No matter what experiences you have had in your life or you are having now,you, and no-one else, created them.Two things worth remembering throughout this book and your own life: the victimmentality creates the victim reality. And: if you believe it, you will achieveit.This creation of reality happens on many levels. The sum total of theinteraction of individuals accumulates in the collective mind of humanity. Everyspecies has a collective mind to which all ‘individual’ members of that speciesare connected. We add our thought patterns constantly to the collective leveland have access to other patterns held at the collective level. It is a two wayprocess. We give and we receive. Scientists have established something calledthe hundredth monkey syndrome which I have written about in other books. Theyhave discovered that once a certain number of individuals within a species learnsomething new, suddenly the rest of that species can do it without being shown.They do it purely by instinct. Although establishment science cannot explainthis by its incredibly limited view of life, the process is very simple. Oncethat certain number within a species has transferred the new knowledge into thecollective level, a point of ‘critical mass’ is reached. The knowledge becomespowerful enough in the collective mind for it to be accessed by every othermember of the species. When they attune themselves to the vibration (the thoughtpattern) which contains that knowledge, they know how to do something withoutbeing shown, because that thought pattern is guiding them. We call it instinctor inspiration when it is really tuning to a vibration (a frequency) that holdsthat information.All that I have said about the individual creating their own reality equallyapplies to the collective human mind. It reflects the sum total of humanthinking, the sum total of what humanity as a whole thinks of itself. Ifhumanity doesn’t like itself, love itself, and respect itself, it will createthat reality on this planet. It will attract to it physical manifestations ofhow it views its own sense of worth and potential. Only this time, the magneticcape is not cast around only one person, but the entire planet. This creates theglobal reality.Look at the consequences of this process in our every day lives. Humanity as awhole wishes to give away its responsibility for what happens in the world. Whenanything goes wrong, we hear the cry: “What are they going to do about it?” Werarely look at ourselves for responsibility. We may like to complain aboutpoliticians and bankers, but most people would still rather others ran the worldthan accept the responsibility for playing their part. These are the thoughtpatterns which dominate the collective mind and it has therefore created thatreality on a collective, global, scale. The collective mind has created aresponse to that desire for someone else to ‘do it’ by attracting together theenergy fields – people – to construct the secret network which now controls thedirection of everyone’s lives. We have been given what we asked for, or‘thought’ for. It is the same with religions. They, too, are created by thethought patterns of the collective mind, as are the media and other institutionswhich use fear and guilt for purposes of manipulation and control. Thesereflect, collectively, what billions of people do in their everyday lives. Theymanipulate fear and guilt to get their way. Observe yourself for a few days andsee how many times you (and others) use fear and guilt to control a situation.We do it without realising and we pass this attitude on to our children. What isit we say to them?> “You naughty boy. If you do that again, I’ll give you a big smack. Wait till> your dad gets home, he’ll make you sorry for what you’ve done.” (Fear)> “You naughty girl. How could you do that to your mummy and daddy? How could> you make us so sad and unhappy? And all we have done for you.” (Guilt)These are only minor examples of the way fear and guilt are used on children.From an early age they learn to do the same to others. By the time we reach theadult world and the interrelationships that go on there, the use of fear andguilt for control and manipulation has become an art form. They ought to awardmedals for it! This thought pattern has consequently dominated the collectivemind, and it has created the collective physical reflection of this – thereligions and other institutions which tell us what to think and use fear andguilt to control. Again, we created them. They are a reflection of us, thecollective us, at least. That’s good news because we have the power to removethis global manipulation by removing our personal manipulation.Such a transformation of human perception is so vital to the future of thisplanet and the world we leave our children. Humanity’s desire to give its mindaway has allowed a structure to develop over thousands of years which today ison the verge of creating a global fascist dictatorship. Fascism ended with AdolfHitler? If only it were so. That same mindset controls the secret government ofthe world which is, minute by minute, manipulating the human mind to accept acentralised global tyranny. This tyranny is called the New World Order and,unless we shake ourselves from our spiritual slumber, it will manifest as aworld government; a world central bank and currency; a world army; and amicrochipped population linked to a global computer. If anyone thinks all thisis ridiculous, the next few hundred pages are going to be very sobering. We areastonishingly close to all of those things. It is time to grow up and wake up.As you read the story of how your life and the life of this planet has been socontrolled and manipulated, I ask you to remember that we all created it. Thepeople I name and the events I describe are only mirrors reflecting back at thehuman race and the Earth the thought patterns within us. This world is merelyhuman thought made physical. When we recognise what those negative patterns areand remove them, our reality will change and the world will change. But notuntil.It begins and ends with us."},{"pageContent":"part onethe prison> > I believe in … someone else> We are actively discouraged from thinking constructively and questioningly,> and once an individual has accepted the numb acquiescence so encouraged, an> insidiously vicious circle has successfully been promoted.

Why does life have to be such a struggle? Why do we know so littleabout who we are and the purpose of our lives? Why is there so much conflict andsuffering in a world of such beauty and such riches?In search of the answers to these and so many other questions, I’m going to askyou to suspend your programmed ‘here and now’ responses and open your infinitemind to much greater possibilities. I don’t use the word ‘programmed’ in apatronising way, because we are all programmed by the messages and beliefs weconstantly hear in our childhood, through the media, and through the educationsystem. It is the letting go of that programming which opens our minds and ourhearts to wonder, potential, and understanding beyond our dreams. I’ve ponderedon the nature of this visible physical world for a long time, trying to makesense of it. Since 1990 I’ve been on a conscious spiritual journey of discovery.It has opened me to so much I had never thought or felt before in this lifetimeand, painful as some of it has been, those moments, too, have led me to greaterunderstanding. I have experienced how we can tune our minds, our consciousness,to other levels of reality and access information available there which is notknown, or at least not widely known on Earth. I have realised that our minds –the thinking, feeling us – are a series of energy fields, which use the physicalbody as a vehicle for experience.At this moment, our consciousness is tuned to this dense physical world, so thisis our reality. When we ‘die’, our mind-spirit (our consciousness) leaves thistemporary physical body and moves on to another wavelength, another stage ofexperience and evolution.A most important point to make is that, while in the same physical body on thesame planet, a person’s mind can be tuned to many different wavelengths ofknowledge and understanding. This is why there is such a variation inconsciousness, perspective and perception within the human race. In our dailylives, we even talk of people being on ‘different wavelengths’, because theythink so differently and have so little in common. Our attitude to life and thelevel of knowledge and wisdom we can attain at any point depends on thevibratory levels which our minds can access. All this is essential background towhat I believe is behind the history of the human race over many millions ofyears and into the present day. To me the human race so often seems to be like aherd of bewildered and lost sheep. In fact, look at how many times throughoutknown history the ‘lost sheep’ symbolism has been used to describe our plight.We have somehow become detached from our higher potential, our power source;again, we see this portrayed symbolically throughout history and cultures inphrases such as ‘lost children’ who have become disconnected from ‘the father’.The story of the prodigal son in the New Testament is an obvious example. Ibelieve that, symbolically, this is precisely what has happened and theconsequences of that explain so much of the world we live in today.I feel it is impossible to appreciate what has happened unless we can open ourminds to the existence of what we call extraterrestrial life. That can includean infinite variety of forms. All I mean by extraterrestrial is ‘not of thisEarth’ – other civilisations, consciousness and lifeforms on other wavelengthswhich our physical senses cannot normally see or hear. For instance, while wemay look at some of the other planets in this solar system and see apparentlybarren, lifeless, lands, we are only looking at that planet on our own frequencyor dimension of experience, our own space-time reality. On another dimension,that planet may be a teeming haven of life in the same way that all the radioand television stations broadcasting to your area now are sharing the same spacethat your body is occupying. You can’t see them and they can’t ‘see’ each otherbecause they are operating on different wavelengths. Take this one stage furtherto encompass the fact that these other civilisations on other wavelengths aremore advanced in their knowledge and know-how than we are at this time, and apicture begins to form, for me and many others, anyway. These othercivilisations are not all positive or negative. Like us, they are a bit of both.Extraterrestrial life is no big deal. It is the same stream of life we callCreation or God, at a different stage of evolution and/or on a differentwavelength of experience. But many of these peoples are years, sometimesmillions of years (in our version of time) ahead of where we are technologicallyand in their understanding of the universal laws. If we judge the credibility orcraziness of something only from the perspective of our scientific achievementson this wavelength of Planet Earth, we will never understand what has happenedto us. This is why I ask the skeptics to open themselves to other possibilities.If you were a peasant farmer in the mountains of some self-contained society indeepest Asia, you would find it impossible to believe a description of New York.But New York would still exist. And remember, only a short time has passed sincethe idea of humans flying off into space was considered ridiculous.Over a number of years, as I have sought to grasp the nature of the humancondition, a story has begun to form in my mind. When I read a book calledBringers Of The Dawn,1 it cross-confirmed some of the themes I had written inThe Robots’ Rebellion and other ideas that I had been developing in the monthsthat followed. It is a ‘channelled’ book, in that the writer, Barbara Marciniak,tuned her consciousness to another wavelength of reality and acted as a channelto bring information to this Earth vibration. I am always wary of channelledbooks because, like everything, this process can produce inspired understandingor a load of utter claptrap. It depends on the competence of the channel and thelevel of the wavelength to which they are connecting. As someone once said ofcontact with those no longer on this Earth: “Death is no cure for ignorance”. Ifyou connect with wavelengths close to this one, you can be seriously misled.Bringers Of The Dawn claims to be the words of a consciousness communicatingfrom the star system we know as the Pleiades. I know if you are new to this, itall sounds so fantastic and hard to accept. But all I can do – all any of us cando – is to say what we believe and feel. I believe that this star system calledthe Pleiades, or at least the more evolved groups from there, are part of auniversal operation to set humanity and this world free from the prison we haveunknowingly lived within for aeons of what we call time. We are the generationwho are going to see this happen.Planet Earth was hijacked, you could say, and taken over by another civilisationor civilisations, which are highly advanced technologically, but pretty low onlove and wisdom. This is, as always, a telling and profoundly imbalancedcombination. I call it ‘cleverness without wisdom’. We live in a free-willuniverse where, within certain limits, we are allowed to experience all of theemotions, and learn from the consequences of our actions. So taking over aplanet does not bring in the ‘father’, the Source of All That Exists, toimmediately wrest control from the hijackers. It is used as a period ofexperience from which all will learn and evolve. We live in a time-space reality– “world” – called the Third Dimension and it is from some of our “neighbours”in the Fourth Dimension that the interference has come. Whenever I speak of theextraterrestrial consciousness or the Prison Warder consciousness I am referringto manipulation from the Fourth Dimension via either thought control or directintervention. Both the hijacking extraterrestrials and those with humanity’sinterests at heart were regular visitors to the Earth thousands of years ago.They became the ‘gods’ in the ancient texts and legends which have formed thefoundations of most, perhaps all, of the major religions of today. If anextraterrestrial landed on the planet in ancient times in an astonishinganti-gravity spacecraft, or you saw a psychic vision of someone on anotherfrequency, you would sure as hell think he or she was a god! And they did. Thisis where the ‘gods’ – particularly the angry, judgmental, fire and brimstonegods – originated: negative extraterrestrials. The ‘fear of God’ was born, andthis fear and resistance to change (disobeying the gods) is still in thecollective psyche. Over time, as described at length in The Robots’ Rebellion,these various god myths became fused together to form ‘composite gods’, based onthemes from many of the earlier civilisations. So it is with Judaism, theChristian Bible, Islam, and most of the others. Their version of God relates tothe type of extraterrestrials from which their religion originated or the waymany different extraterrestrial stories have become fused into a composite Godover the centuries. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to worship acomposite God made up of extraterrestrials. Amen.If you look at the origins of the major religions, the stories are remarkablysimilar to those we hear today from people claiming to have met, or beenabducted by, extraterrestrials. Mohammed, the founder of Islam in the seventhcentury, said that he had been visited by the Angel Gabriel, who was “in thelikeness of a man, standing in the sky above the horizon”.2 This figure told himhe had to be a prophet, and he was given messages which formed the Islamic holybook, the Koran. These messages would be dictated while Mohammed was in a tranceon many other occasions in the years that followed. He also wrote of going on a‘celestial journey’. Many people in the modern world who claim to haveexperienced extraterrestrial contact have said the same as Mohammed. Saul ofTarsus, better known as St Paul, was the man who changed the image of Y’shua(Jesus)3 into the saviour-god-messiah from which the Christian religion wasspawned. This happened after he had a ‘vision’ of Y’shua on the road toDamascus. He also talked about being ‘taken up’ into heaven, or a number ofdifferent heavens (dimensions). Speaking of himself, he wrote:> “I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third> heaven. Whether he was in the body or out of the body, I do not know – God> knows. And I know that this man – whether in the body or out of the body I do> not know, but God knows – was caught up in Paradise. He heard inexpressible> things, things that man is not permitted to tell.”> 2 Corinthians 12: 2–4Again, this is paralleled by many of today’s accounts of extraterrestrialabductees who have told of being taken into other dimensions of reality by ETs,sometimes in their body, sometimes out of it. St Paul and the prophet calledEnoch speak of seeing many heavens when they were ‘taken up’; this correspondswith the stories in the Vedas, the ancient holy books of India which werewritten in the original Sanskrit language. These describe seven higher planesand seven lower planes around this planet. Some people still talk of being in‘Seventh Heaven’ when something wonderful happens to them. One of these ‘planes’is our third dimension and just above us vibrationally is the level which hasmanipulated us. In the Book of Enoch, the ‘Watchers’ sound remarkably likeextraterrestrials. The Dead Sea Scrolls say that the father of Noah was a‘Watcher’, and Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon from 651–604BC, records beingvisited by a Watcher and a holy one who came down from heaven.4 The Dakas inMahayana Buddhism were ‘sky travelling beings’ and Padma Sambhava, the founderof Tibetan Buddhism, was said to have left Tibet in a celestial chariot.5Something similar was claimed for the biblical prophet Elijah when he leftIsrael6 and for the Central American god, Quetzalcoatl.7 Descriptions of flyingdiscs, flying boats, and celestial chariots, abound on all continents and in allcultures. Still today we relate ‘heaven’ to the sky, because that is where the‘gods’ of ancient time came from in their spacecraft. The aborigines ofAustralia speak of three ancestral beings, called the Djanggawul, who wereconnected with the planet Venus, as was Quetzalcoatl and the Polynesian deity,Kahuna.8 Add to all these the many examples cited in The Robots’ Rebellion andcountless other books, linking ETs with the creation and supervision of theEarth races, and only a padlocked mind could dismiss at least the possibility –I would say probability – that extraterrestrials are at the heart of humanhistory and the events that have shaped that history.There are so many themes which link the ancient texts with descriptions of UFOsightings and extraterrestrials of today. UFO investigators tracked down thealleged author of a report known as The Memorandum. Bill English was a formercaptain in intelligence with the Green Berets in Vietnam involved in theretrieval of a B-52 bomber forced down in the jungle by a UFO. He claims to havespent three months in a psychiatric unit after the experience, before beingassigned to an RAF listening post in England by US Army Intelligence. In hisoffice there, he says, he found a sealed diplomatic pouch waiting for him whichcontained a 624-page report on UFOs, known as The Grudge 13 Report. Hismemorandum was his personal analysis of this document. It included all topsecret UFO activity from 1942 to 1951 and this involved reported landings,sightings, UFO crashes, human abductions, and ETs captured by the government.This could all quite easily be disinformation because there is so much of thatin the UFO scene. But the report did contain many interesting points. It saidthat the language of the captured ETs was similar to Sanskrit, the ancientlanguage of the Indian holy texts, the Vedas, which contain many references towhat appear to be spacecraft and flying machines known as the Vimanas and toextraterrestrial ‘gods’.The Grudge Report said that the nourishment absorbed by the ETs they examinedwas based on chlorophyll, which (as is now known) exists throughout what we callspace and not just on Earth. In the Vedas, there is considerable importancegiven to a plant known as Soma. It was used as a hallucinogenic drug inceremonies to help communication with the ‘god’ Indira and other ‘gods’, and itwas the favourite drink of Indira and his colleagues. Given the increasingspeculation that the ancient ‘gods’ were actually extraterrestrials, it israther a coincidence that the Soma drink is believed to have been based onliquid chlorophyll. A number of people who have claimed contact with ETs havereported that their nourishment came from ‘juice’. There are, however, tens ofthousands of extraterrestrial civilisations which have visited this planet, Ibelieve, and they will be very different in appearance, genetics, and means ofnourishment. Some undoubtedly look very much as we do and could walk past us inthe street without turning a head. Others appear very different from us.I feel that at least many of the ‘miracles’ recorded throughout religious legendhave an extraterrestrial (Fourth Dimensional) origin. The sight witnessed by70,000 Catholics at Fatima, Portugal in 1917 sounds like many of the storiesdescribed in both the ancient texts and the modern world. The Fatima ‘miracle’followed a series of meetings between three children and some strange being,which, they said, sometimes manifested as the Virgin Mary. The being promised toproduce a miracle to open the eyes of humanity, and those tens of thousands ofpeople who turned up to witness it did, indeed, see a fantastic sight. But whatwas it? UFO researcher, Jacque Vallee, believed he knew when he wrote, in his1976 book, The Invisible College:> “Not only was a flying disc or globe consistently involved, but its motion,> its falling leaf trajectory, its light effects, the thunderclaps, the buzzing> sounds, the strange fragrance, the fall of ‘angel hair’ that dissolves on the> ground, the heat wave associated with the close approach of the disc, all of> these are constant parameters of UFO sightings everywhere. And so are the> paralysis, the amnesia, the conversions, and healings.”The children passed a sealed message from their communicator to the Pope, withinstructions that it was only to be opened and made public in 1960. The Pope didopen it in 1960, but we are still waiting for all of it to be made public! Onething is for sure: if it had confirmed the basis of the Roman Catholic religion,it would have hit the airwaves within minutes. So what did it say?I am convinced that the Old Testament ‘God’ known as Yhwh (Yahweh) is also basedon an extraterrestrial, or more likely, a series of them. Interestingly, whilethe Jewish religion is perceived as a ‘One God’ faith, the original Hebrew textsdo not support this. While the English translation refers to a ‘God’, the Hebrewtalks of Elohim, the plural meaning ‘Gods’. Similarly, while we read the word‘Lord’ in the English, the Hebrew refers to Adonai, the plural ‘Lords’. Jehovah,who is often interchanged with Yahweh, would seem to have a different origin.Another extraterrestrial, most probably.If you read the Old Testament and other ancient texts and replace everyreference to ‘God’ or ‘the gods’ with ‘extraterrestrial’, the whole thing beginsto make sense and becomes so obvious. It is important to remember that inevolutionary terms, the time span between the period when these accounts werewritten and today is nothing, hardly the blink of an eye. Modern UFO phenomenaas reported by thousands of people – which include amazing holographic images,beings and craft which appear and disappear (switch dimensions), and a host ofother visions and tricks that put Walt Disney in the shade – were beingperformed by extraterrestrials in the periods during which the major religionsoriginated. These Fourth Dimensional manipulators created the religions tocontrol the human mind as they sought to control this dimension.The potential for manipulating humanity with such technology is simplylimitless. What better way to control people, close down their minds and divideand rule, than to create a series of dogmatic religions based onextraterrestrial special effects? Look at the pain, misery, andinter-generational ignorance that has been visited upon this planet byChristianity, Islam, Judaism, and all the rest. If you want to shut downsomeone’s consciousness so they stop thinking for themselves and delink theirminds from their infinite potential, sell them a dogmatic religion or some otherform of rigid dogma. They are then putty in your hands.I think the takeover of Planet Earth was achieved by what I call the LucifericConsciousness. I use this as an overall name to describe the force whichattempts to work through all life forms, human and extraterrestrial, to controlthe planet. It is an extremely negative energy operating from the FourthDimension. The Luciferic Consciousness takes two main forms. Different culturesgive these forms different symbolic names. One seeks to imprison us in thematerial world by persuading us to reject all idea of the spiritual realms andthe eternal nature of life. The other works on spiritually-minded people topersuade them to ignore the realities of the physical world and to float aroundin a spiritual daze. Either way it means that the people involved can becontrolled and their potential to bring positive change to the physical world isseriously curtailed.[../Images/00002.jpg]Figure 2: is the Earth a vibratory prison?The takeover of the Earth by the extraterrestrial expressions of this LucifericConsciousness took the form, I feel, of creating a vibratory prison. We aremultidimensional beings, working across many frequencies and dimensions at thesame time. I know these can be strange concepts to those hearing them cold, butour real potential and our perceived potential are light years apart, as we aregoing to realise in the amazing years that are to follow. If, therefore, thereis a frequency ‘net’ thrown around this planet, a blocking, imprisoningvibration, which prevents us from interconnecting with the higher levels of ourconsciousness and potential, we cease to be ‘whole’. We become delinked from‘the father’. With the knowledge held on the Fourth Dimension, this would not bethe miracle it might at first appear. Blocking frequencies are already used hereon Earth, never mind by more technologically advanced civilisations. During theperiod of the Soviet Union, they created an information prison by sending outblocking frequencies to stop certain foreign radio stations from being receivedby the population. This prevented information which challenged the official linefrom reaching the people. It created a vibratory prison, an information prison.Extend that concept to the planet as a whole and you have the very picture I ampresenting (Figure 2). The only difference is one of scale, that’s all.In his book, The Montauk Project,9 the electrical engineer, Preston Nichols,tells the story of how he discovered a blocking frequency which jammed the mindsof psychics he was working with as part of research into telepathy. The basis oftelepathy, as Preston Nichols confirmed, is so simple. When we think we send outa thought-wave similar to a radio or television wave broadcast from atransmitter. A radio or television set decodes those waves and, in a far moresophisticated way, the human mind decodes thought-waves. Hence telepathy.Nichols found that the minds of his psychics were blocked at the same time eachday. Using tracking equipment, he traced the jamming frequency to a nownotorious centre of mind control and time travel research called Montauk, on theeastern end of Long Island, New York. Even on Earth, blocking frequencies are afact.I am going to use the term blocking and jamming frequency for simplicity, but itcould well have taken the form of closing down the portals and gateways whichlink this physical dimension we see around us with other space-time dimensions.Some of these gateways are reckoned to be at the great sacred places of theancients, like Stonehenge, Machu Picchu in Peru, Ayers Rock, and the formerlands of Babylon and Mesopotamia, now Iraq. The Bermuda Triangle is believed tobe another, which could explain the many strange disappearances of ships andaircraft, as the gateway opens. It may even be that these gateways were largelyclosed down for positive reasons, to prevent more negative extraterrestrialsfrom entering this space-time reality. There are lots of maybes and so much moreto know and understand. Jamming frequency, closing the dimensional gateways,perhaps both – the precise cause of the prison doesn’t matter for what I amsaying in this book. All we need to remember is that an extraterrestrial forcefrom the Fourth Dimension created an information prison by blocking off thehigher levels of human consciousness. The veil came down. A veil of tears. Wewere, in effect, put into spiritual and mental quarantine.If such a jamming vibration were thrown around our planet, or even the SolarSystem and further afield, our potential would be confined to the levels ofconsciousness which are within the imprisoning frequency. Any consciousness andknowledge held on higher frequencies outside this vibratory prison would bedenied to us. We would become delinked from the higher levels of our ownconsciousness. We would be, in the words of the ancient books, ‘lost souls’delinked from ‘the father’. I have used the following analogy many times, but Ithink it sums it up pretty well: You are a spaceman on the Moon. You arereceiving information through your eyes and ears from the world immediatelyaround you. You are also receiving information about the wider picture and agreater understanding of your task from what we call ‘Mission Control’. Whenyou, the spaceman, are getting a balance of information through your eyes andears and from the greater perspective of Mission Control, everything is fine andyou are operating at full potential. But think what would happen if the linkwith Mission Control was cut. Suddenly the wider understanding and guidance hasgone. Only the ‘eyes and ears’ information from the world immediately around youis left to guide your thinking and behaviour. Very soon that behaviour andperception would be enormously different from what it would have been had youand Mission Control stayed in powerful contact.When that blocking, imprisoning frequency was thrown around this planet, theSolar System, and possibly beyond, it had that same effect. We lost touch withour Mission Control and, crucially, with our eternal memory. We forgot who wewere and where we came from. Or, at least, the overwhelming majority did. Thosewho could continue to hold their vibratory rate, their frequency, could stillstay in touch with their higher levels, their Higher Self, because the vibratoryconnection was still there, although the blocking frequency made this a lessthan perfect connection, even for them. More and more people are able to do thistoday as the blocking frequency is dispersed and this is the basis of what istermed the ‘spiritual awakening’ now enveloping this planet. Only a tiny fewhave been able to do this, however, until very recently. The rest have seentheir vibratory rate fall under the influence of events, religions, and generalprogramming which has encouraged them to close down their minds and thereforereduce their vibratory rate. This has created a vibratory gap – for some a chasm– between their lower levels of consciousness inside the blocking frequency (theLower Self) and their infinite potential outside of that frequency (the HigherSelf). Within the prison was this physical level and some non-physical levels towhich we return between incarnations. The rest of Creation has been denied tomost people. You might see it as the human race living out its existence insidea box with the lid held down. We sit in the dark, believing that our potential,and Creation in general, is limited to what is within that box, within thatvibratory prison. Infinity in potential and space is so, so close on the otherside of the box lid, but we have not been allowed to see outside and we have notrealised that there is an outside. Over the thousands of years or more since thevibratory ‘net’ was cast around the Earth, we have been a people, a race,working to a fraction of our full and infinite potential. Life on Earth changeddramatically and I believe this also affected the animal kingdom. The law of thejungle and the cruelty we see within nature is not the way it was meant to be, Ifeel, nor the way it was before the veil came down. The good news is – shout itfrom the roof tops – that this period of disconnection is now entering its endtime. Wow. What a future we are going to experience!In the period after the blocking vibration was created, I believe that FourthDimensional extraterrestrials of the Luciferic mindset came here and geneticallyrewired the DNA, the inherited coding of the physical body. Over a period oftime, this new DNA pattern was passed on through the generations to everyone.The DNA determines the nature of the physical being and contains the inheritedmemory of all the generations. If the DNA had been left alone, we would, whileliving in a vibratory prison, at least know what had happened and the nature ofthe problem. By scrambling the DNA, this knowledge, too, was lost to us. Thecommunicators of the information in Bringers Of The Dawn (and in other booksclaiming to come from extraterrestrial sources) say that the human DNA beforethat time had twelve spirals known as helixes, but after the genetic tinkeringthis was reduced to two. Our potential and our inherited information source wasreduced to a sixth of what it is meant to be. Even now, I understand, there areparts of the DNA which have been identified that researchers have been unable tolink to any apparent function. This has been termed ‘junk DNA’. It is possiblythe disconnection of the other ten spirals of DNA which has meant that, as iswidely acknowledged, only a fraction of our brain’s potential is actually used.Some more good news to celebrate – we are in the time when a process isunfolding which will reunite those DNA spirals within us. My goodness! What wewill then be able to know, remember, and do, will beggar belief from today’sperspective.It is possible that these genetic events are described symbolically in the taleof Adam and Eve and the term, ‘the Fall of Man’. You can also find manyreferences in the ancient texts and legends to ‘gods’ coming from the skies tocontrol humanity and impregnate women. In the Bible, Genesis 6:4 says that, “Thesons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them”.The term ‘sons of God’ (which is common to almost all ancient religions)referred, I am sure, to the extraterrestrials. We hear of how God or the godscreated humanity ‘in their own image’. I outline a number of these ancientthemes in The Robots’ Rebellion. The offspring of these extraterrestrial/humanliaisons looked very different from the rest of the people. As Genesis 6:4 putsit in The Good News Bible: “In those days, and even later, there were giants onthe Earth who were descendants of human women and the heavenly beings. They werethe great heroes and famous men of long ago”. The reasonthis-world-is-all-there-is science has been unable to find the missing links inhuman genetic evolution is because there aren’t any. The sudden changes in thehuman form were due to extraterrestrial intervention. This is possibly an originof the virgin mother legends which are also found throughout the world. In whatwe call China, they had a ‘sky god’ called Di who was said to have‘miraculously’ impregnated a virgin, who then gave birth to Zu, the first of thenew genetic line. All over the ancient world, you find that the royal familieswere supposed to have originated with the sky gods – extraterrestrials. Recordsleft by the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia say that their pyramidal towersknown as ziggurats were built for intercourse between a priestess and a god fromthe sky. Herodotus described the inside of a ziggurat he saw in Babylon:> “On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands> a great bed covered with fine bedclothes with a golden table at its side.> There is no statue of any kind set up in this place, nor is the chamber> occupied at night by any but a single native woman who, say the Chaldean> priests, is chosen by the deity out of all the women of the land. The priests> also declare, but I for one do not credit it, that the god comes down in> person into this chamber, and sleeps upon the couch.” 10On a tomb found in Rome and dated between the First and Fourth Centuries AD theinscription read: “I am a son of the Earth and the stars of the sky, but I am ofthe celestial race. May the knowledge be passed on!”11 The birth of Y’shua(Jesus), as described in the Gnostic Gospels, also has similarities to modernday ET experiences. The Protoevangelion of James is the oldest of the GnosticGospels which were removed from Christian orthodoxy at the notorious Council ofNicaea in 325AD (see The Robots’ Rebellion). The Gnostic text describes thebirth of Y’shua and how people and animals froze in mid-gesture in a powerful,though temporary paralysis, while Joseph and the midwife were unaffected. Thisis very much a theme of ET contactee/abductee experiences. The text goes on:> “And the midwife went away with him. And they stood in the place of the cave,> and behold a luminous cloud overshadowed the cave. And the midwife said: ‘My> soul has been magnified this day, because mine eyes have seen strange things –> because salvation has been brought forth to Israel’. And immediately the cloud> disappeared out of the cave, and a great light shone in the cave, so that the> eyes could not bear it. And in a little that light gradually decreased until> the infant appeared, and went and took the breast of his mother, Mary.”The connections with ‘gods’ and ‘clouds’ are endless in the ancient legends andtexts and what about the ‘star’ that was supposed to have hovered over thebirthplace of Y’shua? Why could that not have been a spacecraft? In the biblicalRevelations we hear of the New Jerusalem descending from the sky (Rev 22:10) andY’shua returning ‘with the clouds’ (Rev 1:7). Was Y’shua a member of a positiveextraterrestrial race who became incarnate to help humanity get out of prison?It is certainly a possibility. The Native American tribe, the Iroquois, have alegend of an Iroquois maiden marrying the chief of the sky people. Thegeologist, Christian O’Brien, suggested that Hebrew and Sumerian texts refer toa race of beings known as the ‘Shining Ones’, a term he connects with the Hebrewword, Elohim. It is no coincidence that the Devas from the Sanskrit and theAngels of Christianity are also ‘Shining Ones’. The Incas of Peru referred to‘Shining Ones’ too. O’Brien says that it was the beings known as the Elohimwhich created modern humanity from early human forms through geneticmanipulation. He adds that some of them, the ‘Watchers’ in the Book of Enoch,mated with humans and he believes that the alleged founders of the Semitic race,Shemjaza and Yahweh, were among the extraterrestrial ‘Watchers’ and ‘ShiningOnes’.12An Israeli scholar, Zecharia Sitchin, used the ancient Sumerian and Babylonianwritings to support his belief that modern humans were created by ETs called theNefilim.13 UFO abductees today have also spoken of communications with ETs whodescribed how they created the bodies of the present human race and manipulatedour DNA; there are many references by abductees to having sex withextraterrestrials while on a spacecraft. Not all of these stories will be true,nor all the theories and details, but if you take note of the common themes, apicture starts to form. I believe that different extraterrestrial civilisationsseeded the different races on Earth and perhaps this can explain the obsessionthat some have with the purity of their race. Most will not relate this to anextraterrestrial origin, but at a deep, subconscious level, that might be whatis motivating them.I believe the Earth is far older than science has imagined and that a stream ofcivilisations has settled and developed here which are not mentioned in thehistory books. Most of them before ‘the Fall’ were far more highly evolved,technologically and spiritually, than humanity is today. Life is not alwaysabout progressing mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Ifsomething happens to delink us from our true potential, we can also gobackwards. It depends on the knowledge and potential available to us. In theperiods known as Lemuria and Atlantis, hundreds of thousands of years ago in ourversion of time, humans lived in what we would call a science fiction world, inwhich amazing things were possible, as was also true in civilisations beforethose. These were not miracles, merely the use of the natural laws of Creation.What is termed the paranormal or supernatural is only that which our limitedversion of science has not discovered or acknowledged yet. Everything thatexists is the result of ‘natural’ laws. If it were not, it could not exist. Webegan to go backwards when the jamming frequency was installed, and the levelsof consciousness which contained the knowledge enjoyed before recorded humanhistory were denied to us. The prison door slammed shut and we are now flingingit open again.Human civilisation did not begin on Planet Earth, I am convinced. It came tothis planet from other areas of the galaxy. Some say the first humans on Earthcame from the star system called Vega, 26 light-years from here, and three timesthe size of the Sun. It is the brightest star in the Lyra constellation and thefifth brightest in our sky.14 Wherever it was, I feel the human race originallycame from another star system and took the opportunity to populate andexperience this magnificent new planet. Genetic manipulation, both positive andnegative, has continued ever since to advance or control the species, dependingon the mindset at the time. In those earlier times, I think the nature of thephysical form was not as dense as it is today. It was more etheric, lighter andless dense, and capable of manifesting and demanifesting, levitation, andfloating above the surface. All these things are possible now if the power ofour thought is concentrated sufficiently, but it was available to everyone then,I believe, as an everyday part of life. In those periods, there was no physical‘death’. The consciousness withdrew from the body when it chose to do so. Wewill be doing this again as the transformation of this planet and humanityproceeds.Another theme which connects channelled information from many sources purportingto be extraterrestrial civilisations and the symbolic stories in the ancienttexts and legends across thousands of years, is that of a war in the heavens,possibly a war between extraterrestrial civilisations for control of thisgalaxy. I feel this relates to the struggle between two consciousness streams onthe Fourth Dimension, for the control of this one. Lemuria was the creation ofone of these streams, Atlantis the work of the other. It has been a long andbitter battle with humanity as the pawns in the middle. The Indian Vedas containstories that could easily describe a high tech battle in the skies. Those whoare more evolved technologically do not have to be more evolved spiritually. Thedevelopment of the atomic bomb is a case in point. Developing the bomb wasbrilliant technologically. Dropping it was the very opposite of spirituality. SoI find it quite feasible that all hell broke loose in parts of this galaxy, asextraterrestrials battled for power with their highly advanced toys. I feel thatfilms like Star Wars and other science ‘fiction’ stories are the result of thewriters accessing their deep memories or having direct knowledge of whathappened. It is this same inner memory at some deep level of our consciousnessthat attracts such astonishing numbers of people to the science fiction filmsand literature. Some of the places which crop up most often in channelledinformation relating to these conflicts are the systems of Orion, Sirius, andthe Pleiades. Interesting, then, that these were at the fore of ancient beliefsand worship on Earth over thousands of years, across scores of cultures. Thepyramids at Giza and the giant spider drawn in ancient times on the plains ofNazca, Peru, are exactly aligned with Orion. I think the star Arcturus in theBootes constellation is also significant to the Earth’s history.The aim of the negative extraterrestrials in relation to the Earth was to turnhumans into little more than a slave race. This has been a theme all along andit remains so today, although in another form. Instead of controlling usphysically by occupation of the planet, over the past few thousand years theyhave sought to do so by working through our consciousness from other dimensions.I believe there came a period after ancient Babylon and Egypt when, for somereason, they no longer came here in the same way. Maybe they were forced out byother extraterrestrials who were trying to help us. Maybe it was vibratorychanges that took place. Either way, I believe they began to work mostly throughthe human mind from the Fourth Dimension and that this has replaced the physicaloccupation of the distant past. I have no doubt they have still come here,however, and in increasing numbers in more recent times. The Lord Of The Ringsby J.R. Tolkien, has themes of war between the humanlike Hobbits and the littlegrey Orcs which many believe resemble the themes of what has actually happened,even down to the descriptions of subterranean laboratories which mirror theclaims of what is happening today in the underground bases and geneticlaboratories under America and other countries.The battle for the Earth possibly reached its most destructive phase at the endof Atlantis, over a period of tens of thousands of years, leading up to the vastisland of Atlantis sinking into the Atlantic Ocean around 10,500–9,500BC. Theevidence is mounting from many sources of some cataclysmic weather andgeological upheavals around this time, in which whole mountain ranges pushed upfrom the Earth and an unbelievable tidal wave of some kind swept across theplanet’s surface. The geological researchers, J.B. Delair and D.S. Allan,document much of this evidence in their book, When The Earth Nearly Died.15 Theybelieve that a star exploded around 15,000BC and some of the debris reached thissolar system about 9,500BC, leaving devastation in its wake. Their work confirmsthe themes of channelled communications over thousands of years when they claimthat the Earth surface we see today was created largely by an enormous upheaval,almost in the twinkling of an eye in evolutionary terms, and not by the slow,gradual change so promoted by mainstream, official-line, science.The detail of these various views is interesting, but I find the overall themesemerging from ancient and modern information and beliefs to be the mostcompelling aspect in all this. Those themes are of a considerableextraterrestrial influence on human affairs, a battle between extraterrestrialcivilisations for supremacy, and a catastrophe on Earth and throughout the SolarSystem caused by a foreign ‘body’ of some kind passing through. I feel that suchthemes are connected and that connection is the Luciferic Consciousness. It is acollective consciousness, the total of all minds – human and extraterrestrial –thinking within that extreme negative frequency range. While it is not possiblefor one person or group to destabilise a planetary system with their thoughtsalone, it is certainly possible (in my view anyway) for a multidimensionalcollective consciousness to do so.As everything is created by thought and all matter is subordinate to thought,all physical events are the result of a thought or thoughts of some kindaffecting matter. Everything is. What scientists are doing when they investigatethe ‘laws’ of physics and matter is to put forward mathematical equations whichdescribe the power and potential of thought, most of which they have so farmissed. All of these events which caused mayhem in the Solar System took placewithin the confines of the vibratory prison, created by representations of theLuciferic Consciousness. This consciousness manipulates through any lifeform,human or extraterrestrial, which is operating within its vibratory range. TheLuciferic Consciousness is an extremely negative thought pattern, or range ofthought patterns, and anyone whose own attitudes are within that range can becaptured by it and turned into a vehicle for its will. It is the same principleas tuning a radio into a particular station. When the Luciferic Consciousnesslocks into someone’s consciousness, it, in effect, becomes their ‘MissionControl’, their guide. If our intent remains loving and positive, it cannotaffect us directly because our energy fields, the mind-emotions-spirit, will bevibrating within a range much higher than the Luciferic band. There is noresonance established. The Luciferic ‘broadcast’ is not received by aconsciousness ‘tuned’ to a different frequency, just as a radio receiver onlypicks up stations within a defined bandwidth at any given time.I feel that the civilisation we call Atlantis was an attempt – by what I call(in The Robots’ Rebellion) the ‘volunteers’, and Bringers Of The Dawn calls theFamily of Light and the Systems Busters – to break the vibratory stronghold, theblocking vibration. These volunteers were mostly from the more positiveconsciousness stream on the Fourth Dimension. It was an influx of beings intothe prison, the box, attempting to change the Earth vibration and break thecontrolling frequency. It was, for a time, a partial success, but Atlantisbecame a highly negative place under influence from the Luciferic stream and itsuffered a violent end. We, the generations of today, now have the opportunityto do what Atlantis could not do – break the blocking vibration and allowhumanity to return to wholeness and Oneness, to reconnect with our fullpotential. It is an opportunity we are going to grasp and we are going to do itpeacefully. Not with physical force, but with love. I want to tell this story assimply as possible without getting lost in complexities. I will therefore usesome simplistic terms for two overall streams of thinking, which seek ratherdifferent futures for Planet Earth. The Prison Warders, as I will call them, isa symbolic name for the Fourth Dimensional consciousness which took over theplanet and delinked humanity, vibrationally and genetically, from our fullpotential and higher knowledge. I don’t wish to present this in reality as asimple ‘light v dark’, ‘good v evil’ thing because we are all part of the samewhole anyway, all aspects of the same one consciousness that we call God orCreation. We all have a positive and negative polarity which we are seeking tobalance. But at different points in our evolution we all have differentattitudes and it is the interaction of these various thought patterns, positiveand negative, which sets up the experiences that speed evolution. The otherstream of thinking is represented by those entities and consciousness streamswhich wish to break through the limitations and disconnections imposed onhumanity and the Earth, and to restore freedom of thought and potential. I willcall this stream of consciousness the ‘Light’ or ‘Love’ vibration.One other point to make about this vibratory hijack is the nature of ‘food’ andnourishment. On this physical level our bodies need physical food to sustainthem. But on other frequencies of reality in the non-physical realms ofconsciousness, the food is pure energy. The more energy of like vibration whichcan be created, the bigger the meal, if you like. The energy that the PrisonWarder/Luciferic Consciousness absorbs and gets its power from is negativeenergy. The more of that which can be created, the more powerful it canpotentially become. And the more imbalanced, too, of course. Emotions like fear,guilt, and anger, can, if not balanced by positive emotions, produce vastsupplies of negative energy. A war becomes a banquet. We are generating energyall the time and the psychically sensitive can feel and see it. In fact we allcan, although most people don’t realise it. If humanity can be manipulated to befull of fear, guilt, and anger, the vibratory ‘box’ in which we live becomes aproduction line of negative energy. For the Prison Warders, lunch is served! Itis interesting that today’s stories about negative extraterrestrials presentlyat large on Earth speak of them living off negative human emotions and seekingto stimulate events and circumstances in which more extreme negative energy willbe created. I believe this to be correct and it is a key reason why thisextraterrestrial consciousness, the Prison Warders, has worked through humanminds to stimulate the horrors of history and today. These events are not theresult of an ‘evil’ human nature. They are manufactured by manipulating humannature and its sense of reality. It is highly likely, too, that the animal andhuman sacrifices to the ‘gods’ (which abound throughout history and in culturesall over the world) were performed to serve the extraterrestrials’ need for suchenergy and perhaps for some portions of the physical body. The Aztecs in CentralAmerica, who sacrificed untold numbers of people to the ‘gods’, are but oneexample of this. Fortunately, most extraterrestrials are not of this extremenegative mindset; a host of positive ET civilisations are at work today onvarious wavelengths around this planet to ease the spiritual transformation tofreedom which has now begun. They are here to help us.After the introduction of the blocking frequency, when people ‘died’ and theirconsciousness left the physical body, most could not escape further than thenon-physical frequencies which were contained within the vibratory prison. Evenwhen not in physical bodies, they continued to be disconnected from their higherconsciousness, their Higher Self, as we call it – they were imprisoned in theThird Dimension. So began the process of incarnation and reincarnation intoEarth bodies, as beings sought to continue their evolution inside a prison theydidn’t even realise was a prison. The ‘gods’ who supervised the prison wereperceived to be the God. Many people became so imbalanced and locked intocertain thought patterns and attitudes that they chose to reincarnate into thesame situations, places, and races. As they repeated the old responses, Earthlife after Earth life, they became more and more imbalanced. Others of greaterunderstanding used their incarnations as a vehicle for gathering experience andevolving.Our consciousness is a series of interconnecting magnetic energy fields and thegreater our understanding and openness of mind, the quicker those energy fieldsvibrate. After the prison door was closed, those trapped inside were encouragedand manipulated to close their minds and that still continues today, of course.All the positive extraterrestrials can do is to give us the opportunity to openour minds and raise ourselves vibrationally to reconnect with our infiniteselves. This is what they are seeking to do with phenomena like the croppatterns.It is quite simple really. The positive Fourth Dimensional (and higher) ETs aretrying to open our minds and hearts and the negative ones are seeking to keepthem closed. Our minds cannot be opened by extraterrestrials just landing on theWhite House lawn. That would not open the collective human mind; it would blowit! Look at the mass panic in 1938, when Orson Welles presented his radio show,War Of The Worlds which purported to be a live broadcast about a landing byextraterrestrials. The mind is like a muscle; the more you use it, the better itworks and the bigger it becomes. So we have to be given clues which stretch ourconsciousness to understand and trigger the memories we hold at a deeper levelof our consciousness. The negative ETs, in contrast, wish to keep from us anyinformation which would stimulate us spiritually and intellectually.A few people through history have been able to open and expand theirconsciousness to the point where they have raised their vibratory rate beyondthat of the prison vibration and reunited fully with the rest of themselves andCreation. This process has been given the name ‘ascension’ – getting out of jail– and it shows itself in the words attributed to Y’shua and similar figuresthroughout history: “I and my father are one”. We see many of these people inthe history books. They were able to raise their consciousness while inincarnation, to connect with frequencies outside of the prison and so understandthe nature of the predicament humanity is in. They were laughed at and condemnedbecause they were speaking from a knowledge accessed from levels outside of theblocking vibration, while most of the people to whom they were speaking couldconceive only of the world they knew and saw all around them. They couldremember no other.We return to the central theme of the book: creating our own reality. The PrisonWarder consciousness knows all about this process. Our physical reality is thecreation of the thoughts we hold onto, past and present. These create a patternwithin us which is then cast around us in the form of a magnetic cape/aura. Thisattracts to us a physical reality in terms of people, places, and events whichexactly reflects our inner pattern, how we see ourselves. The key to thisreality is thought. If you can manipulate someone’s thoughts and view ofthemselves, you are creating that person’s reality and, as a result, theirphysical experience. More than that, people will generally pass onto theirchildren large chunks of their own views and beliefs, thus manipulating – oftenwith the best of intentions – how the children view themselves and theirpotential. This affects the children’s sense of self and creates theircorresponding physical reality.In short, once you can manipulate the thoughts of one generation, it gets easierto impose your will on future generations because you now have the programmedparents and ‘leaders’ unknowingly working on your behalf. You will seethroughout the story revealed in this book how the foundation of the globalmanipulation is the manipulation of the individual human mind and its view ofself and the world. The Global Conspiracy (with the Prison Warder consciousnessat the apex of the pyramid) is a conspiracy to manipulate the human race’s senseof self and, in doing so, the creation of its physical reality. As I say, thevictim mentality creates the victim reality. Today, we have a planet awash withpeople who have been encouraged to think of themselves as victims, hence theyare.What has happened through this period of the global prison is a reflection ofwhat is happening within the collective human mind. We collectively attractedthis experience to us. We created this reality, just as the battered wife withno sense of self-love and self-worth subconsciously attracts to her thepunishment she believes she deserves. The woman in that state of mind willmanifest her sense of self by magnetically attracting the energy field of a manwho desires to punish another. In the same way the collective human mind’s innerlack of self-love and self-worth attracted the Prison Warder/LucifericConsciousness to do the same. If there was not an imbalance within thecollective human mind which relates to this experience we are going through, wewould not have created this experience. The problem and the solution begins andends with the self. If we all find love for ourselves, that is the reality wewill create for ourselves and, together, that is the reality the collective mindwill create. When we do that, the Luciferic Consciousness will no longer affectus, because we will no longer attract the experiences it provides.When viewed from the higher levels of understanding, the LucifericConsciousness, horrific as it may be in the physical ‘here and now’, is actuallyan experience we have created as a mirror for us to face the collectiveimbalances within the human mind and, in doing so, remove them. If we see itthat way, it becomes a positive experience at least in outcome.> SOURCES> > > 1 Barbara Marciniak, Bringers Of The Dawn (Bear & Co, Sante Fe, 1992)> > > 2 Hari Prasad Shastri, The Ramayana Of Valmiki (Shanti Sadam, London,> > > 1976) Vol. II, p95> > > 3 Jesus is a Greek translation of a Judean name, probably Y’shua, the> > > Hebrew for Joshua.

A dogma will always vehementlydefend itself from other information and repel any alternative opinion whichcontradicts its narrow, solidified view. Dogmas become a person’s sense ofsecurity and means of retaining power. Humanity tends to cling to both until itsknuckles turn white.Dogmas take endless forms and when you can persuade different people to holdopposing dogmas, the manipulation of conflict and control through ‘divide andrule’ becomes easy. It is happening today in the same way – more so, in fact –as it has throughout the period of the vibratory prison. To a manipulator,Judaism is just as useful as Christianity and Islam; the political ‘Left’ isjust as important as the political ‘Right’. You need two dogmas to play offagainst each other. The most effective dogmas over thousands of years have beenthe religions. One generation takes on a narrow view of life and themselves (areligion) and imposes it on their children, who then do the same to theirchildren, and so it goes on into the modern world. The religious and politicaldogmas have all been inspired by negative elements from the Fourth Dimension.The two leading weapons used by religions are those cancerous emotions: fear andguilt. They have been used to suppress the human mind and to destroy its senseof self-worth, thus creating a physical reality to match. Religions are the samethought pattern manifesting under different names – the thought pattern calledcontrol. Even the origins of their myths, stories and ceremonies are invariablythe same because they all originate from the same source!Towards the end of Atlantis, groups of people began to escape from theirincreasingly devastated land. Some left the prison while their vibratory ratewas still high enough for them to do so; others became trapped by accident ordesign. As Atlantis crumbled, some settled in the areas we now know as Egypt andthe Middle East, Central America, and the United States. Those who survived thecataclysm which followed, passed on their knowledge to their children in mythsand stories. This is one possible answer to the apparent mystery of how when theAmericas were ‘discovered’ by the Europeans in the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies, they found many cultures and beliefs of the native peoples to beremarkably similar to (sometimes the same as) those in the ‘Old World’ of Europeand the Middle East. Both were influenced by the knowledge brought by theescaping Atlanteans, although I think another reason for this relates toextraterrestrial activity all over the world. In the period after Atlantis, Ibelieve that extraterrestrial expressions of the Prison Warder consciousnessstill landed and interacted with the people, telling different peoples the samebasic manipulated story.Some Atlanteans escaped by sailing west to the Americas, some went east toEurope and North Africa. It is possible that the biblical story of Noah and theArk relates to this period, although it could involve another flood somethousands of years later. Over many millennia, the Atlantean andextraterrestrial knowledge was passed on through the succeeding generations, andthe original clarity was lost in the repeated communication. The knowledge alsobecame a vehicle for control, and it was accordingly changed to suit those inpower at any given time. This is why you still find elements of this knowledgein all religions. The original core knowledge has been diluted and diverted incountless directions, to manifest as religions such as Christianity, Islam,Judaism, Paganism, Hinduism, etc. All have retained the themes of the knowledgeto some extent, while often destroying its true meaning with dogma, myth, andmanipulated make-believe. Ironically, Paganism has retained far more of theoriginal knowledge than those religions (such as Christianity) which condemn itas ‘evil’. The Fourth Dimensional Prison Warders wish to prevent us from knowingwho we are, how we have been imprisoned, and how we can get out of prison.Making us confused and dividing us into factions, religions, and tongues waspart of the Prison Warder strategy. If you read the story of the Tower of Babel,you can see this described symbolically:> “At first the people of the whole world had only one language and used the> same words. As they wandered about in the East, they came to a plain in> Babylonia and settled there. They said to one another, ‘Come on! Let’s make> bricks and bake them hard’. So they had bricks to build with and mortar to> hold them together. They said: ‘Now let’s build a city with a tower that> reaches to the sky, so that we can make a name for ourselves and not be> scattered all over the Earth’.> “Then the Lord [extraterrestrials] came down to see the city and the tower> which those men had built, and he said: ‘Now then, these are all one people> and they speak one language; this is just the beginning of what they are going> to do. Soon they will be able to do anything they want! Let us go down and mix> up their language so they will not understand one another.’ So the Lord> scattered them all over the Earth, and they stopped building the city. The> city was called Babylon, because there the Lord mixed up the language of all> the people, and from there he scattered them all over the Earth.”> Genesis, 11:1–9Christianity sees those people in a highly negative light when, I believe, itwas actually the other way around. They were rebelling against the control.After Atlantis, other civilisations began to emerge from the reincarnation ofAtlantean consciousness. The knowledge they passed on through the generations,and extraterrestrial intervention, was both positive and negative. There was thecivilisation called Sumer in Mesopotamia (now Iraq), which developed alongsidethe Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sumer is believed to have originated fromaround 6000BC, although such figures must be treated as only estimates. Thiswould later become part of the Babylonian Empire, which greatly influenced thebeliefs of Judaism and, through that, Christianity, as did the Egyptiancivilisation. You can read the detailed history of all this in The Robots’Rebellion.A contact who has worked on the ‘inside’ of government and security agencies inthe UK told me a story which relates both to Sumer and the themes of anextraterrestrial takeover. He says that in the 1960s the British intelligenceagencies produced a secret report detailing claims of extraterrestrialsightings. This involved interviewing 1,800 people in Europe and Scandinavia whoclaimed to have seen a UFO, an extraterrestrial, or had contact with beings fromanother world. At the same time, he says, similar surveys were being compiled inthe United States, the Soviet Union, Australia and Japan. Eventually they pooledtheir findings and this made available some 62,000 interviews with people acrossthe globe. Firstly, the vast, vast majority of the stories told of positive,loving communications with the ETs of various races. This is so different to the“evil aliens” stories we see in the media. Secondly, about 75% of thoseinterviewed all over the world apparently told the same basic story. They saidthat the ETs told them how a planet called Melchedek had once existed in oursolar system, but the Melchedekans had become obsessed with the material worldand they destroyed their environment. In the end they exploded so many nucleardevices during tests and conflicts that the planet broke apart and itselfexploded. The asteroid belt was said to be part of the remnants of Melchedek.According to the stories of the contactees in the survey, about 5,000 of theMelchedekan ‘elite’ escaped and landed on the Earth in the place we know asSumer, now Iraq. The Melchedekan race were described as…wait for it…blond hairedand blue eyed. The “Aryan” ‘Master Race’ described by Adolf Hitler. These werethe ‘gods’ described in the Sumerian tablets, this story goes, and as timepassed they used their advanced knowledge of genetics to create a new race ofEarth people – the white race we see today. This was symbolised by the story ofAdam and Eve and forbidding them to eat from the tree of knowledge was symbolicof the plan to keep the Earth races ignorant of who they really were. In effect,a slave race was created and this has continued to the present day. Thecontactees said that it was the Melchedekans who became known as the Elohim inthe Biblical texts. I think this Fourth Dimensional force is known by manynames. The original Earth people were the black, red, and other native peoplesof the world in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia – not the white race,the contactees were told.There were two streams of Melchedekan ‘invaders’. Those who only interbred witheach other, thus keeping the blond haired, blue eyed genetic ‘purity’. These,the ET communicators said, were still living on the Earth, though mostly out ofsight underground. The others interbred with their newly created Earth races,but again they sought, and still do, to keep this genetic stream as pure aspossible by interbreeding only within the family or within a small circle ofsimilar genetic background. It was said that it is this genetic stream whichoverwhelmingly make up the families of the ‘Illuminati’ that have manipulatedthe course of human history since the time of Sumer. The manipulation has guidedthis planet along the same destructive road that Melchedek experienced. Againaccording to the overwhelming majority of the 62,000 interviewed, there are alsofive other extraterrestrial races working on Earth today to help humanity breakout of the mental prison and remove the Melchedekan manipulation. One of theseraces is described as about eleven feet tall, the “giants” of ancient legend,perhaps? They have double hip joints, very large foreheads, blue eyes, a smallgap in the face rather than what we would call a mouth, and very big feet. Makeof all that what you will, but this could – could – be another expression ofFourth Dimensional beings operating on our frequency.It is certainly true that Sumer was the origin of so much that was to shapehuman culture and existence. The Christian belief in a Son of God and a Lamb ofGod dying so our sins could be forgiven can be found in Sumer, Babylon, andEgypt. The idea of a lamb dying to forgive the sins of humanity originates fromthe Sumerian belief that if you literally sacrificed a lamb on the altar, itwould remove the sins of the people involved. While I was writing this book, Isaw a picture in a newspaper of an Orthodox Jew today, still waving a chickenaround the head of a young girl, in the belief that the chicken would absorb her‘sins’. Virgin mothers of ‘saviour’ figures abound throughout the ancient worldand, indeed, can be found in the beliefs of the native peoples of North, South,and Central America. The Bible story of the Garden of Eden is mirrored in themuch earlier Sumerian story of the Garden of Edinnu, and even the idea of theSabbath can be found in the Sumerian day of rest, the Sabattu. The Jewishpeoples were held in captivity in Babylon and, when they were freed by thePersians, they took many of the Babylonian stories and beliefs back toPalestine. These found their way into the Old Testament of the Bible and throughthat into the New Testament. Today’s religions are the recycling of ancientbeliefs and symbolic stories which have been added to and twisted under theguidance of the Prison Warder consciousness, until the original meaning has beenlost under an avalanche of myth and invention. So often when you investigate theorigin of the foundation stories of the religions, you find the same basicthemes with different names for the alleged heroes and villains. For theChristian version of Jesus, see also Bel (Sumer), Dionysus (Greece), Mithra(Persia and Rome), Osiris (Egypt), Quetzalcoatl (Central and South America),Krishna (India), and so on. In this way, the spiritual knowledge from which allreligions originally derive, has, to a large extent, been destroyed in thepublic arena. This process has been essential to controlling the human race. Youtake information out of the public arena and pass it on secretly only to thosewho share your ambitions.The foundation of the manipulation of the world has always been the control ofknowledge. While the religions were using fear, guilt and imposition to sell thepeople a desperately narrow view of life and themselves, a secret networkdeveloped to pass on far more advanced knowledge to the privileged few. Evenwithin this vibratory prison, there is knowledge that remains hidden from mostpeople. It does not compare with the knowledge available outside the prison, butit is still far in advance of that which humanity in general has been allowed toknow. If you want to manipulate people, it is essential that you have knowledgewhich they don’t have. One of the first rules of control and manipulation is“Don’t let your victims know what you know”. I will call this ‘hidden’,suppressed understanding the ‘esoteric knowledge’. The dictionary definition ofesoteric is: “of a philosophical doctrine meant only for the initiated, notgenerally intelligible; private, confidential”. Sums it up perfectly. Thisknowledge has been kept from the mass of the people for reasons of manipulationand control. Hence, the knowledge has indeed become ‘private, [and]confidential’.[../Images/00020.jpg]Figure 3There is an unfolding global awakening, however, which will make theseunderstandings available to all who wish to hear, and the conspiracy to keephumanity in the spiritual dark will crumble and fall. It is already doing so. Akey part of this process is to reveal the nature of the deception and why it isbeing perpetrated. The vehicle for keeping this knowledge from the public arenahas been the system of initiations used by the ancient mystery schools and thenow immense secret society network all over the world, which I call theBrotherhood. Each higher level of initiate is given more knowledge than thosebelow. This sets up a pyramid structure, with the few who reach the top levelsof initiation knowing far, far more than the majority further down the ladder(see Figure 3). This makes it easy for those few to manipulate the rest. Thecontent of this esoteric knowledge relates to an understanding of the laws andpotential of Creation which is far in advance of the ‘science’ we are allowed tosee in the public arena, and of the knowledge of the human psyche, its nature,and how it can be programmed and controlled.The hoarding of such knowledge was not always done for negative reasons. WhenChristianity imposed its misguided and manipulative dogma throughout most of theknown world, it was suicidal to speak of these alternative spiritual beliefs inpublic. Not surprisingly, they were passed on in secret or hidden within legendsand symbolic stories. Thank goodness they were! But knowledge is neutral. It ishow you use it that is negative or positive. The spiritual knowledge can be usedand abused, and so can the secrecy inherent in the societies and mystery schoolswhich, particularly at their higher levels, know spiritual realities denied tomost people. In the same way that each higher level of initiate within thesecret societies knows more than those below them, so the Fourth DimensionalPrison Warders ensure that they know far more than even those human vehicles atthe top of the global pyramid of manipulation. Today, at their higher levels,this network of secret societies and the knowledge it has inherited are beingused, I believe, for almost entirely negative reasons, under the direction ofits highest, controlling core: the Global Elite or simply the Elite. The membersof this Elite are either direct incarnations of the Fourth Dimensional PrisonWarders or have their minds controlled by them. The aim of the Brotherhood andits interdimensional controllers has been to centralise power in the hands of afew. This process is very advanced and it is happening on a global scale thanksto modern technology. The game plan is known as the Great Work of Ages or theNew World Order, and it seeks to introduce a world government to which allnations would be colonies; a world central bank and currency; a world army; anda microchipped population connected to a global computer. What is happeningtoday is the culmination of the manipulation which has been unfolding forthousands of years.The idea of passing on the knowledge through a series of secret initiations goesback at least to Atlantis, probably much further. A common theme of channelledinformation is that there was a sort of temple in Atlantis, where thoseconsidered to be trustworthy would be given knowledge that the bulk of thepopulation did not have. When the civilisations that followed Atlantis began toemerge, they, too, continued to have initiations into different levels of theknowledge. Among these organisations were the Mystery Schools of Babylon, Egypt,and Greece, which guarded their knowledge with enormous secrecy; the smallestviolation of the oath of secrecy was punishable by death. From this foundationcame today’s massive secret society network. These mystery schools of initiationwere inspired by the negative elements of the Fourth Dimension, and have beensupervised by them through the consciousness of the highest initiates, theadepts, since that time. In his study Fragments Of A Faith Forgotten, ProfessorG. R. S. Mead says:> “A persistent tradition in connection with all the great Mystery institutions> was that their several founders were the introducers of all the arts of> civilization; they were either themselves gods or were instructed by gods – in> brief, that they were men of far greater knowledge than any who had come> after; they were the teachers of infant races…> “It is said that these earliest teachers of humanity who founded the> Mystery-institutions as the most efficient means of giving infant humanity> instructions in higher things, were souls belonging to a more highly developed> humanity than our own…In the earliest times, according to this view, the> mysteries were conducted by those who had a knowledge of nature-powers which> was the acquisition of a prior perfected humanity not necessarily Earth-born> and the wonders shown therein such that none of our humanity could of> themselves produce.” 1This initiation structure was either negative from the start in its ambitionsfor humanity, or it was later taken over by that consciousness. I feel thehighly influential Egyptian Brotherhood has been dominated by negativemanipulation at least since the end of the reign of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, whodied around 1,362BC. He had moved the Egyptian court to a new city in MiddleEgypt called El-Amarna, and there he built a Brotherhood Temple for the esotericinitiations. When he died, his successors moved the royal court back north toThebes, but the Brotherhood stayed at El-Amarna and broke away from the state.Through the centuries, other vehicles for communicating the knowledge emerged.Some, like the Cathars in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were destroyedby the Catholic Church in the most horrific manner after spreading theirinfluence over a wide area from their base in Southern France. The Knights ofthe Temple (Knights Templar), who came to prominence about the same time as theCathars, were dealt with equally severely by Papal ‘justice’. But the Templarswent underground and their influence has continued up to the present day, bothin their own right, and within other secret societies which are, after all, partof the same overall organisation. This period of the Cathars and the Crusadesspawned many Brotherhood offshoots, which continue to significantly influenceevents – secret societies like the Knights Hospitallers of St. John, known todayas The Knights of Malta. Nor was this merely a phenomenon of the Christian andJewish world. Similar secret societies were created within all cultures, and theArab Brotherhood Grand Lodge in Cairo was to become a major manipulator ofevents.The aim of this negative Brotherhood structure is to persuade the mass of thepeople to believe any old nonsense while the manipulators keep for themselvesthe knowledge of the nature of life and Creation and how to exploit the power ofthe mind, the Earth’s energy fields, and the global energy grid (the network ofenergy lines known by different cultures as ley lines, meridians, and dragonlines). But even the privileged initiates did not retain the purity of theinformation through the centuries. To this day, they work with a twisted versionof the knowledge, albeit still far more advanced in its understanding of theuniversal laws than anything you will find in the religions and establishmentsciences that the rest of us are asked to accept. The greatest misunderstandingof the negative Brotherhood relates to the power of love. The Prison Warderconsciousness which controls the minds of those who manipulate the Brotherhooddoes not understand love. It generates and feeds upon negative energy, and themore negative energy it can produce and encourage humanity to produce, the morepowerful it becomes. To this consciousness, love is like garlic to a vampire,and without love – the energy on which all Creation exists – knowledge willalways be misused. Knowledge without love is the state of being which stillcontrols the higher levels of the Brotherhood network, via its Global Elite. Itis the intellect without the heart, you could say, and without the balancedfeminine.The symbols of the Brotherhood in ancient times remain those of the Brotherhoodtoday – the pyramid and all-seeing eye, the swastika, the lamb, the apron, theobelisk and many others. The obelisk is symbolic of the penis of Osiris, theEgyptian god. The legend is that he was torn into pieces by the ‘evil’ Set(Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, et al.) and when Isis, the wife of Osiris, tried toput him back together again, she found all his missing parts, except you knowwhat. Such legends are, I feel, symbolic of much more straightforward truths.The obelisk and Osiris’s penis in that story symbolise male energy, which hasdominated the world throughout recorded history. All of us, and Creation as awhole, are in search of balance and harmony between opposites – negative andpositive, male and female. These are the Yin and Yang-type forces of Chineseculture. When one of these forces dominates, there is an imbalance whichmanifests as imbalanced behaviour. The transformation the planet is now goingthrough is designed to bring such forces into harmony and balance so that allserve, but none dominates. The suppression of female energy by the male hascreated a male-dominated world and the ‘macho man’ is one of its offspring. Thishas not been by accident, but by design – the Prison Warders’ design. Harmonyand balance in all things = wholeness. Wholeness = infinite potential. That’sthe last thing the Prison Warders want, because such people are impossible tocontrol. Instead, they have sought to imbalance us. Disharmony and imbalance =division of self. Division of self = limited potential.The two major imbalances within ourselves and the prison in general have beenthe negative dominating the positive and the male dominating the female. Thereis no greater manifestation of the male imbalance than what is seen in some ofthe major religions and in the secret society network. The re-emergence offemale energy is crucial to the harmonising of the Earth, and by that, I don’tonly mean the re-emergence of women into areas of decision-making. I mean thereawakening of female energy within the male form also, and a softening of theindoctrinated desire of so many men to dominate and to follow the macho manprogramming. This re-emergence of female energy is symbolised as ‘the return ofthe goddess’.It is highly appropriate that the obelisk (the symbol of male energy) should beso important to the Brotherhood over the centuries, because it is, after all, abrotherhood, not a brother-and-sisterhood. The secret societies are almostentirely male-dominated with women excluded from the knowledge and decisionmaking. Look at the Freemasons as an example. It is a male preserve, with theirwives wheeled out for the annual dinner like a piece of decoration. Such amale-dominated organisation must by definition be imbalanced, and this one mostcertainly is. The Freemasons have become one of the most important of the secretsocieties which have appeared since the ancient times, and they have basedthemselves on the structure and beliefs of the Brotherhood Mystery Schools, ashave the others. I will refer to this network as the cult of the All-Seeing Eye,the cult that worships these Fourth Dimensional “gods” or “masters”. It goesback to antiquity and this same stream of manipulation is behind the New WorldOrder to this day. It is a fusion of the ancient esoteric beliefs which haveemerged from Babylon, Egypt, and the Hebrew Kabbala School. The higher levels ofthe Freemasons still worship a ‘God’ called Jahbulon – Jah (Jehovah, Hebrew),Bul (Baal, Babylon), and On (Osiris, Egypt).Perhaps the most important achievement by this Global Elite-Brotherhood on thejourney to world domination has been the colonisation of America, a land it knewexisted long before it was officially ‘discovered’. Throughout known humanhistory, there have been two levels of knowledge operating on this planet. Oneis made public for the mass of the people to see, most of which is flawed andmanipulated to control our thinking and the reality we create, while the otheris known only to the few, mostly in the Elite levels of the Brotherhood. Theconventional story behind the ‘discovery’ of the Americas is an example of this.The history books tell us that Christopher Columbus made a guess in 1492 thatthe Earth was round or pear-shaped and if he sailed west, he believed, he wouldeventually reach India and the Far East which had already been identified byMarco Polo. It is said that he ‘accidentally’ discovered what we call the WestIndies and that he believed he had found India, to the day he died. We arefurther told that John Cabot and his son, Sebastian, both Venetians, set offfrom Bristol four years after Columbus had sailed from Spain; Cabot ‘discovered’North America in 1497. No link is offered by conventional history between thesetwo events. But when you look deeper there is a potential link: the knowledgeheld by the Brotherhood network, which had been passed on secretly since thetime of Atlantis.The 33rd degree Freemason, Manly P. Hall, points out in his book, America’sAssignment With Destiny,2 that John Cabot’s real name was Giovanni Caboto. Hewas born in Genoa, the city where Colombus is said to have been born, and Cabotolater became a naturalised Venetian. It is suggested that he was involved with asecret Christian Brotherhood sect known as the Johannites, which was greatlyinfluenced by the esoteric doctrines of the Templars. Legends say he visited theso called ‘Wise Men of the Near East’ – just as Colombus had done. Columbus hadhis own Brotherhood connections. His father was a member of the Brotherhoodbranch, The Order of the Christ. Columbus himself was involved with a groupwhich followed the beliefs of the poet Dante, who was a member of the CatharChurch and an initiate of the Knights Templar. Columbus was often seen wearingthe garb of what was believed to be the Franciscan Order. Columbus’s son saidhis father had died in such attire. The priests at the ancient EgyptianBrotherhood Temple at El-Amarna wore a similar habit, as did a Brotherhood groupcalled the Fraternités at the time of Columbus. These are only some of hisBrotherhood connections. Columbus’s father-in-law was a member of the Knights ofChrist, the undercover name for the Knights Templar. When the Templars werepurged across Europe, they survived in Portugal by changing their name to theKnights of Christ. They devoted themselves to maritime activity. The explorer,Vasco de Gama, was a Knight of Christ, as was Prince Henry the Navigator, aGrand Master of the Order. Columbus’s father-in-law was one of Prince Henry’scaptains, and inherited maps and charts from him which Columbus used to ‘find’the Americas. The red cross on a white background was the Templars symbol. Itwas outlawed by the Pope at the time of the purge. Columbus’s ships sailed withthe red cross on a white background!3 His historic journey was funded by KingFerdinand of Aragon, Spain and Queen Isabella of Castile, Spain, whose marriagehelped to unify Spain. These were ‘Catholic’ monarchs funding a trip by a manflying the flag of the Knights Templar. More than that, other support came fromLeonardo da Vinci and Lorenzo de Medici, both high initiates of Brotherhoodsecret societies. Given this background to Columbus and Caboto, it is hardlystretching the bounds of credibility to suggest that their ‘discovery’ ofdifferent parts of the Americas within four or five years of each other was nocoincidence. Many of the early explorers and colonisers were known to be membersof Brotherhood societies. They knew what they were looking for because they hadthe maps and charts of the world passed down over thousands of years by theBrotherhood, perhaps since Atlantis.In 1513, Piri Reis, an admiral in the navy of the Ottoman Turks, produced a mapshowing the land mass of Antarctica which then, as now, was covered by amile-thick sheet of ice! Antarctica wasn’t even officially ‘discovered’ until300 years after the map was compiled. The United States Airforce has confirmedthat the map agrees “very remarkably”4 with the results of the seismic profileproduced by the Swedish-British Antarctic Expedition of 1949. This indicates,says the US airforce, that “the coastline had been mapped before it was coveredby the ice cap”.5 They said they had no idea how the data on the Piri Reis mapcan be reconciled with the state of geographical knowledge in 1513. I can helpthem there. Piri Reis compiled his map from maps and charts passed on throughthe higher levels of the Brotherhood. The evidence is mounting that far frombeing there for millions of years, the ice cap has only been there for maybe6,000 years. The world was mapped before that date by civilisations far inadvance of what we have been told by conventional, doctored history, which isdesigned to fool, not inform us. Columbus and Cabot found the Americas for onesimple reason. They knew what was there!Colonising the Americas and particularly North America seems to have been along-term aim of The Great Work of Ages or the New World Order. Sir FrancisBacon, the Grand Chancellor of England, was a Brotherhood member of high rank atthe time of Elizabeth I and James I. He was a Grand Commander of the BrotherhoodOrder called the Rosicrucians, and very much involved in the undergroundoperations of the Knights Templar traditions. Bacon passed on knowledge secretlyin codes contained in works like the Shakespearean plays, which he wrotehimself. The evidence for this is very substantial and the Shakespeare story isa myth. Sorry Stratford! Bacon used the network to encourage the colonising ofNorth America, not the least to stop the Spanish getting control of it. Morethan that, however, he was working from the Brotherhood agenda. People like SirWalter Raleigh were also in Bacon’s circle, along with other prominent names inElizabethan society.I stress that not everyone within the Brotherhood is of negative intent. Mostare persuaded by those even higher up the ladder that the Great Work is for thegood of all people. Most Brotherhood members have no idea of the despotismcontained in the real agenda which is known to only the tiny few. Indeed, thereal agenda is known only to the Prison Warders of the Fourth Dimension who havebeen the common link in the conspiracy over thousands of years.In his work, The New Atlantis, Bacon sets out his vision of a new world in whichthe power is exercised by a secret society, The Temple of Solomon. In Bacon’svision, the privileged elite study the sciences in secret and act as aninvisible government, deciding what the people should and should not be told.All this is remarkably like the secret manipulation of events and informationtoday. But then, it’s not so remarkable really, because the plan Bacon wasworking from in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is the same one that isbeing followed by the present day Brotherhood. Some of them genuinely believe itis the best way to run the world, but, I most strongly suggest, they arefundamentally misguided because they do not appreciate how such a world can beeasily manipulated by the few to the detriment of all. Most importantly, they donot realise that the Prison Warders are manipulating the whole thing, includingthem.Another significant name in this period was Dr John Dee, an adept (highinitiate) and the official astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I. He was also herunofficial secret agent, and signed his reports 007.6 In a diary entry writtenin Prague in 1586, Dee describes an encounter with a “little man” whose feet“seemed not to touch the ground by a foot height, who moved in a little fierycloud” and who went up into the sky “in a great pillar of fire”. In Prague, Deegave the Emperor Rudolph an illustrated manuscript, written in code and claimedto be the work of Roger Bacon, the thirteenth century Franciscan monk who upsetthe church authorities with his views and ideas. These included prophecies aboutthe microscope, the telescope, the car, submarine, aeroplane, and the beliefthat the Earth was a sphere. All of these facts would have been transmitted fromthe Fourth Dimension. In 1912, this same manuscript was bought by an Americanbook dealer called Wilfrid Voynich and became known as the Voynich Manuscript.When he sent copies to the ‘experts’ of the day, they said that most of thehundreds of plants illustrated did not grow on Earth. Some illustrations lookedlike tissue seen under a microscope and others were of star systems andconstellations. The best code breakers available to United States intelligencein both the first and second world wars tried to decipher what they called “themost mysterious manuscript in the world”, but none could do it. A professor atthe University of Pennsylvania called William Romaine Newbold claimed to havedecoded some of it in 1921. He said part of the text read:> “In a concave mirror, I saw a star in the form of a snail between the navel of> Pegasus, the girdle of Andromeda, and the head of Cassiopeia.”7What Roger Bacon describes in the manuscript that was acquired by John Dee isnow known to be accurate and the illustration he includes of the Andromedanebula is also correct, but it is depicted from an angle which cannot be seenfrom the Earth! Dee was an adept and channeller of great renown and claimed tocommunicate with an ‘angel with a wand’, an extraterrestrial. The knowledge heldwithin the secret society network has always been far – often centuries – inadvance of what the mass of the people are allowed to know. The knowledge of theexistence of America and its long term place in the plan was well known to theseElizabethan adepts, as it was to those who guided Columbus and the Cabots,thanks to the Fourth Dimensional manipulators.The first permanent English settlement in North America was established atJamestown, Virginia (named after Elizabeth the ‘virgin queen’), in 1607. Manymembers of the Francis Bacon family were among the early settlers. From thatpoint on, the native culture of North America was doomed, as was that of Southand Central America once the Spanish and Portuguese arrived. The way the nativepeoples were slaughtered without mercy and their cultures destroyed withoutrespect or compassion was one of the most appalling episodes in all of humanhistory. Thousands of settlers sailed west from Europe to escape religiouspersecution after the Brotherhood-engineered Reformation divided the ChristianChurch into Protestants and Catholics. This created division and conflict andweakened the power of the Pope. But when the persecuted peoples arrived inAmerica, they often proceeded to persecute the native population and theimmigrants of other religious beliefs in the same merciless way that theythemselves had been treated.The land they occupied, now called the United States, was and is a key weapon inthe Brotherhood’s long term plan for world domination. The Masonic societieswent through a massive change and expansion after the English Civil War andespecially in the early 1700s. Up to that point, only people who worked byprofession as masons or building craftsmen could be members. Now it became opento all and Freemasonary or Speculative Masonry was born. It is likely thatFrancis Bacon was a force behind this transformation. The centre of theFreemasonic network that now expanded rapidly was a new Grand Lodge (launched inLondon in 1717) which became known as the Mother Grand Lodge of the World. Itwas a centre of Freemasonic manipulation, encouraging other lodges to be set upthroughout Europe, the British Empire, and the Americas. Many other versions ofFreemasonry were introduced, including the York Rite and the Scottish Rite ofMichael Ramsey (which was based on the Knights Templar system). The ScottishRite has 33 degrees of initiation and today has enormous influence in thepolitics, economics, military, and security services of Britain, Europe, theUnited States, and many other countries. New York was named after the York Riteof Freemasonry.The Brotherhood plan was for the establishment of an independent United Statesof America – independent of the British government, that is, not independent ofthe Brotherhood. Encouraged by the Mother Grand Lodge in London, the Freemasoniclodges in the colonies of America began to plot and agitate against Britishrule. An economic crisis was engineered, not least through war between Britainand the French. As part of their desperation for income, the British governmentimposed higher taxation and duties on the American colonies. It was an operationcreated and coordinated by the Global Elite which has been repeated over andover again. The network in Britain, as in every other country, includes keybankers, many politicians, and, more importantly, their political advisers. Theysecretly engineered events which caused an economic crisis in Britain. They thenadvised the British government that the only way out of trouble was to levyhigher taxation on the American colonies. At the same time, the American arm ofthe Brotherhood was being directed to whip up hostility against this action andturn that anger into demands for independence from Britain. It appears on thesurface – and in the history books – as Britain versus the American colonies. Infact, the same network was manipulating both sides. This is how all the majorwars and revolutions have been created, as we shall see. This strategy wasdescribed very well by P. Sedir in his Histoire et doctrine des Rose-Croix,published in Paris in 1910:> “Unable to control destinies on Earth openly because governments would resist,> this mystic alliance can act only through secret societies…These, gradually> created as the need for them arises, are divided into distinct groups, groups> seemingly in opposition, sometimes advocating the most contradictory policies> in religion, politics, economics, and literature; but they are all connected,> all directed by the invisible centre that hides its power as it thus seeks to> move all the sceptres of the Earth.”The opposition by the American colonies led the British government to withdrawthe new taxes, except for those on tea, but the Brotherhood was not going to letthe anger subside. Members of the St. Andrews Freemasons Lodge in Boston, led bythe Junior Warden, Paul Revere, dressed up as native American ‘Indians’ andthrew tea chests into the harbour to protest at the tax on tea. The Boston TeaParty, as it became known, was hatched during a supper at the home of theBradlee brothers, who were both members of the St. Andrews Lodge.8 The momentumfor a war of independence gathered strength until it was unstoppable.The leading revolutionaries and those who signed the Declaration of Independencein 1776 were almost all Freemasons. George Washington, the triumphantCommander-in-Chief of the American armies and the first president of the UnitedStates of America, was a high ranking Freemason and all but two of his brigadiergenerals in the war were Masons. Top Freemason and Freemasonic historian, ManlyP. Hall, says that of the fifty-six men who signed the Declaration ofIndependence, nearly fifty were known to be Freemasons and only one was knownnot to be.9 Another researcher, Enrique De Vincente, says that fifty-three ofthe signatories were Freemasons and that seventeen presidents, beginning withWashington, have been members of the Order. The second president, John Adams,belonged to a secret society known as The Dragons, named after the magneticenergy lines in the Earth’s energy grid. He studied the sacred geometrycontained in the energy grid and knew how to harness the power it contained.10One of the leading revolutionaries and founding fathers of the United States wasBenjamin Franklin, the first Grand Master of the Freemasons of Pennsylvania. Hebecame a friend of Sir Francis Dashwood, the Chancellor of the British Treasury,and founder of the secret society called the Club of Hell’s Fire. Franklinbecame a member along with the Mayor of London, the son of the Archbishop ofCanterbury, and the Prince of Wales. He travelled to France to canvasssuccessfully for the support of the French Freemasons for the AmericanRevolution, and he also secured the services of the German Freemason, Baron vonStreube, who served in the army of Frederick the Great of Prussia. The baron wasto play a major part in the colonists’ victory over the British. Franklin’sconnections with the French Brotherhood were very close and he became a highranking member of the Lodges of San Juan and the Nine Sisters which, in leaguewith the Grand Orient Lodge in Paris, would trigger the French Revolution of1789. Franklin was made Grand Master of the Nine Sisters. One of the centralrevolutionaries in France, the Marquis de Lafayette, was a friend of Franklinand supported him and the colonists during the American Revolution.[../Images/00008.jpg]Figure 4: The US dollar bill with its classic Brotherhood symbol which goes backto antiquityFreemasons manipulated and won the War of Independence and then took control ofthe new United States of America. They, and other Brotherhood groups, have neverconceded that control to this day. How appropriate, then, that when the foundingfathers commissioned a design for the Great Seal of the United States, itincluded the classic Brotherhood (Prison Warder) symbols which go back toancient Egypt and beyond, including the pyramid and all-seeing eye. Above andbelow this symbol are two Latin phrases, Annuit Coeptis and Novus Ordo Seclorum.These translate as “Announcing the birth, creation, or arrival” of “A New Orderof Ages”. In other words, announcing the creation of the New World Order. Thefounding of the United States was a massive step forward in the plan forcentralised global power. Today this part of the seal can be found on everydollar bill (see Figure 4), and again this is very appropriate, given that theElite controls the American economy and everyone else’s. The decision to put thePyramid/New World Order symbol on the dollar was made by the 33rd degreeFreemason, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1935, with the full support andencouragement of his vice president, Henry Wallace, another 33rd degree Mason.11Mr Roosevelt will be making many appearances in the text of the next fewchapters. The American flag, the Stars and Stripes, was also designed to reflectBrotherhood symbolism and the Statue of Liberty was given to American Freemasonsby the French Grand Orient (Illuminati) Masonic Order.12While ties were ‘officially’ severed between Britain and the United States afterthe war, those between the American Brotherhood societies and ruling familiesand their brethren in Britain and Europe grew still stronger, through the secretnetwork. Again, I am not suggesting that everyone involved in the fight forAmerican independence was negatively motivated, nor that all in the Brotherhoodlodges are of a similar state of mind. Most would have been persuaded they weredoing the right thing and in many ways they were. Often it is not the act, butthe motivation behind the act that we need to watch. One country owning andcontrolling another is quite wrong, in my view. But we need to look at the wideragenda and motivation behind a course of action and look very carefully at whatthe proposed alternative will be. Control of America by a British monarch andgovernment being replaced by control of America by a secret Brotherhood hardlyadvances human freedom, but – and here’s the point to remember – such a transferof power and control can be (and invariably is) justified under the banner ofexpanding human freedom. The American War of Independence was the first in aseries of ‘people’s revolutions’, created and financed by the Brotherhood. Theplan was to end the power of the monarchs. I do not oppose this if it is donepeacefully and with genuine popular support. But instead of ‘power to thepeople’, the monarchs were replaced by other dictatorships, called revolutionarycommittees, communists, fascists or, more subtly, by the illusion of‘democracy’, which in reality was and is rule by the Elite.Let us summarise where we are. A pyramidal structure of human beings has beencreated under the influence and design of the negative manipulators on theFourth Dimension, the Prison Warders. They control the human clique at the topof the pyramid, which I have dubbed the Global Elite. These, in turn, manipulatethe lower levels of the network, within which you will find most of the majornational and global decision-makers in politics, banking, industry, commerce,the media, the military, etc. The Prison Warders manipulate the Elite, the Elitemanipulate the Brotherhood network, and the Brotherhood network manipulates theworld. Each lower level doesn’t know what the level above knows, and none ofthem knows what the Prison Warders know. It is a manipulators’ paradise, withmost people within it not knowing what they are part of or what the final goalwill be.You could describe it symbolically as the clear-sighted (ETs) manipulating thepartially-sighted (Global Elite/Brotherhood), who then manipulate the blind (themass of humanity). With the United States now created and in Brotherhood hands,the control of the world could be advanced even more quickly than before.> SOURCES> > > 1 Professor G.R.S.

This is the process by which banks lend moneythat doesn’t exist (credit) and charge you interest on it! If I gave yousomething that doesn’t exist and asked you to pay me for it, you might considercalling the police. If I gave you something that doesn’t exist and said that ifyou don’t pay me for it I will take you to court and take your property away,you might say we lived in a fascist state. Yet what I have just described is thebanking system of the world and the means through which both people andgovernments are drowning in debt. And what does debt equal? Control.Among the first bankers in the Western world were the Knights Templar. They weregiven enormous riches by Christians supporting the crusades and by legacies frompeople who were often hoping to buy a place in heaven. They were the wealthiestorganisation in every country in which they established themselves, and theirtemples in Paris and London became financial centres. Eventually, King Philip IVof France, in league with Pope Clement V, destroyed the Templars and stole theirfortune to pay debts and, as I outlined in The Robots’ Rebellion, possibly forother reasons, too. The Templars’ Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned atthe stake and the Order then went underground to work and plot secretly withinother organisations. The Christian world had a strict ban on usury (the chargingof interest on loans) but as the centuries passed this was forgotten, and thebanking system which today controls humanity began to develop.The currency of that time was precious metals (such as gold and silver) and, forsafety reasons, the owners began to deposit their wealth with the goldsmiths,who had suitable strong rooms to ensure its safekeeping. The goldsmiths wouldissue paper receipts for the gold and silver deposited with them, and the ownerswould pay their debts by withdrawing portions of their ‘deposits’, as necessary.It was obviously an unwieldly process to move all those metals around and thepaper receipts slowly became accepted as currency. The gold and silver wererarely moved, but the ownership of it changed with the issuing of receipts(‘money’) to pay off debts. In the same way today, vast fortunes are made bysimply moving numbers between one computer file and another.The goldsmiths and other owners of the strong rooms began to realise that, atany one time, only a fraction of the gold and silver was being withdrawn by theowners. “So,” they thought, “why don’t we issue notes (money) to other peoplewho don’t own the gold and charge them interest on the notes?” The only way theruse could fail was if they issued too many notes and everyone came along at thesame time to cash them in for gold and silver. They began to issue notes for theownership of the gold and silver greatly in excess of the amount of gold andsilver they had deposited in their vaults. Most of the notes they lent (andearned interest on) were related to gold and silver which the ‘banks’ did noteven have. But since only a small amount of the metals was being withdrawn atany one time, they were in the clear. They could issue lots of bits of paper forgold and silver that didn’t exist and charge interest for doing so! There, inone sentence, you have a description of today’s banking system, which controlsthe world.People and governments are submerged in debt and desperately trying to payinterest on money that has never, does not, and will never exist. It is reckonedthat on average, for every £1,000 a bank receives from customers, it lends (andcharges interest upon) at least £10,000! It is able to do this through afractional reserve system, which means they only have to keep a fraction (say,one-tenth) of their total deposits in the bank, or ‘reserve’. They count on itnot being called for (demanded) by its customers all at the same time. In mostcountries where banks are regulated, there are rules or laws which allow a bankto shut its doors if too many people want their money out at the same time. Thebank creates this money out of thin air by typing numbers onto a computerscreen. A large slice of your taxes goes to the banks to pay interest on moneycreated in this way when those taxes could be used to ease poverty and hunger,and create greater opportunity. Indeed, if the money system was restructured toserve people and not banks, there is a good case for saying that all taxationcould end.The con-trick is completed by the fact that if you fall behind in your interestpayments on money that doesn’t exist, the bank can take away your car, yourhouse, and other property – wealth that does exist. Remember, too, that whileyou are borrowing a certain figure from the bank, you are paying back more thanthat, with the interest. Where does that interest come from? It comes from thewealth and credit in the world. So with every loan paid back to a bank sincethis system began, the interest payments have been sucking the wealth and moneyof the world into the banking system. With each loan repayment, the control ofthat system is strengthened. This allows the banking system, controlled by theGlobal Elite, to lend even greater sums of non-existent money and submerge evenmore people in debt.The eighteenth century saw a major leap forward for the Global Elite/Brotherhoodambitions as this banking system expanded, especially with the emergence andrapid rise to dominance of the House of Rothschild. Few organisations in moderntimes have served Brotherhood ambitions more than this one. This name willappear on so many occasions in the first half of the book (as I explain how thePrison Warders manifest their control on the physical level), that I should fillin a little Rothschild history here.Mayer Amschel Bauer (later Rothschild) was born in 1743 in Frankfurt, Germany.He married Gutle Schnaper in 1770 and they had a large family of five boys andfive girls. He was educated to be a rabbi, but he later worked briefly for theOppenheimer bank in Hanover and then became a money lender who acted as an agentfor William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. In 1785, William inherited thelargest family fortune in Europe, estimated at some $40 million.1 Some of thiswas accumulated by hiring out troops to Britain to fight in theBrotherhood-engineered American War of Independence.The Rothschild Empire was built on money embezzled by Mayer Amschel fromWilliam, who had in turn stolen it from the soldiers he had hired out to theBritish. The money, perhaps around $3 million, was paid by the Britishgovernment to William to pay the soldiers, but he kept it for himself.2 Williamgave this money to Rothschild to hide it from Napoleon’s armies, but insteadRothschild sent it to England with his son Nathan to establish the London branchof the family’s empire. Nathan used the money to buy a vast quantity of goldfrom the East India Company and he used this gold to finance the Duke ofWellington’s military exploits. Nathan manipulated the situation in such a waythat this became the origin of the enormous Rothschild fortune. We shouldremember that money, like everything, is an energy. It can be used for positiveand negative purposes and it will carry the energy of the ‘intent’ behind it. Tohave the House of Rothschild built on money which was embezzled from anembezzler meant that the empire was built from the start on negative energy.On the back of Nathan’s financial coup, branches of the House of Rothschild wereestablished in Berlin, Paris, Vienna, and Naples. Mayer’s sons were each put incharge of one of them. Today the Rothschild holdings are reported to be held inthe Five Arrows Fund of Curaçao and the Five Arrows Corporation of Toronto,Canada. The name comes from the Rothchild symbol of an eagle with five arrows inits talons, signifying the five sons.3 The fortune expanded by colossal leaps asthe Rothschilds manipulated governments and worked through the Brotherhoodnetwork to create wars and revolutions, often lending money to both sides in theensuing conflicts. You will see that this was to become a standard practice forthe banking elite. It is easy to create conflict and war; you only need tocontrol a dictator or government, ensure that they have the means to build up apowerful army, and then encourage or instruct them to invade other countries.Those countries will, understandably, defend themselves and presto! you have awar.I have heard it said that no-one gains from wars, but that’s not quite correct.The bankers win every time – in the short term. They lend money that doesn’texist to finance both sides and make massive profits on the interest. They alsocontrol the arms manufacturers with whom the two sides spend the funny moneywhich the bankers have loaned. In this way they get their loans back throughtheir armament companies while still charging interest on the original loan tothe governments. Then, when the two or more countries have devastated each otherwith the help of money provided by the banks, those same banks lend them moremoney that doesn’t exist to rebuild their shattered nations and infrastructure.This produces even more profits for the banks and, through debt, gives themcontrol of those countries and their peoples. The Rothschild empire quicklybecame highly skilled in such manipulation, as did those in America like J.P.Morgan, the Rockefeller empire, and many others who, when you look behind thefront organisations and smokescreens, are controlled by the same few familiesand individuals. There is evidence to suggest that in fact the House ofRothschild was behind both of these great American business and banking empires,a demonstration of the Rothschilds’ brilliance for hiding the extent of theirpower and control behind frontmen and organisations.But the bankers cannot do all this alone. They need the help of the Brotherhoodnetwork to manipulate the circumstances in which conflicts will break out. TheRothschilds have long been enthusiastic Freemasons and Napoleon Bonaparte wassurrounded by Freemasons who advised him on his policies and expansionism. Theypersuaded him at one time to invade Egypt and ransack ancient sites forknowledge and artifacts held to be sacred to Freemasonic ritual and legend.Napoleon brought a massive Egyptian obelisk back to Paris as part of thisburglary. British Freemasons persuaded their government to do the same and theresult was the theft of the Egyptian obelisk known as Cleopatra’s Needle, whichstill stands in London. Napoleon’s escapades were well exploited by theBrotherhood and their bankers. In his book, The Rothschilds, historian JohnReeves tells how Nathan Rothschild witnessed the result of the Battle ofWaterloo in 1815 and saw that Wellington had beaten the Napoleonic armies.Nathan then raced as fast as possible for the English Channel and the LondonStock Exchange. There, looking dirty, panic-stricken and dejected, he announcedthat Wellington had been defeated. He gave more credence to this by selling someof his stocks at ridiculously low prices. This started a panic on the marketwith everyone desperately trying to sell at whatever price they could get.Secretly, Nathan and the House of Rothschild were buying these stocks for nextto nothing. At that time, with no telephone or telegraphs it took several daysfor the news to filter back to London that Wellington had in fact won. TheStockmarket immediately rebounded and surged upwards. Nathan proceeded to sellthe stocks he had secretly acquired and reaped massive profits. This same basicmethod has been used ever since and is still used today to manipulate financialmarkets. Stock Market panics are not random. They are engineered to thedetriment of everyone, except those who create them. The approach of theRothschild Empire was summed up by Mayer Amschel when he said: “Give me controlof a nation’s currency and I care not who makes the laws”.4Nathan Rothschild took the Rothschild fortune and influence to new levels. Heboasted that he multiplied their capital 2,500 times in the course of fiveyears.5 He established the private banking concern N.M. Rothschild and Sons inLondon with branches in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Naples. Its purpose was tooperate on the stock exchanges and make loans to governments and others. Itbecame the agent and manager for banks, railways, arms manufacturers, andcorporations of all kinds. From this came branches of the company which weregiven many different names to hide the extent of Rothschild influence, power,and infiltration. This is very much how the financial system operates today,with a few at the centre using endless different fronts and names for the sameorganisation. Just look at the names above the shops in the average city centre;if you look at who actually owns them, you will find it is the same few groups.You also find this with the apparently different soap powders and other productsin the supermarkets. In America, the Rothschild empire was represented bycompanies like Kuhn, Loeb, and Co and it is likely, according to someresearchers, that US companies such as J.P. Morgan, Speyer, and Lehman, werealso controlled or greatly influenced by the Rothschilds. The British PrimeMinister, Benjamin Disraeli, was very close to the Rothschild family. They lenthis government £4 million to buy a controlling stake in the Suez Canal in 1875.Disraeli’s novel, Coningsby, is clearly based on the family’s story. Thecharacter, Sidonia, in this extract, is really Nathan Rothschild:> “He arrived here [London] after the peace of Paris with his large capital. He> staked all that he was worth on the Waterloo loan and the event made him one> of the greatest capitalists in Europe…He reaped the due reward of his> sagacity. Europe did require money and Sidonia [Nathan] was ready to lend it> to Europe. France wanted some, Austria more, Prussia a little, Russia a few> million; Sidonia could furnish them all. The only country he avoided was> Spain; he was too well acquainted with its resources.> “…He established a brother or near relative in whom he could confide, in most> of the principal capitals. He was lord and master of the money markets of the> world and of course virtually lord and master of everything else. He literally> held the revenues of Southern Italy in pawn and monarchs and ministers in all> countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.”> > Or as the historian, John Reeves, put it in his work, The Rothschilds:> “Little could Mayer Amschel have anticipated that his sons would in after> years come to exercise such an unbounded sway that the peace of nations would> depend upon their nod; that the powerful control they exercised on the> European money markets would enable them to pose as the arbiters of peace and> war, since they could at their pleasure withhold or furnish the percuniary> means required to carry on a campaign.> “But this, incredible as it may seem, was what their vast influence, combined> with their enormous wealth and unlimited credit, enabled them to do, for no> firms existed strong enough to oppose them for any length of time, or rash> enough to take up a business which the Rothschilds had refused. To reach this> exalted position, Mayer Amschel and his sons required the cooperation of the> states, but, when once he had climbed over their backs and reached the height> of his ambition, he was independent of all aid and could act with the greatest> freedom, whilst the states remained in a suppliant attitude at his feet.” 6The extent of Rothschild influence by now can hardly be overstated. When Nathandied, his eldest son, Lionel, took his place as the head of N. M. Rothschild.Lionel advanced massive loans to the British and American governments and otherssuch as the Egyptians. This included a loan of around $80 million to Britain tofinance the (Elite-engineered) Crimean War in which tens of thousands died.Lionel also acted as agent to the Russian government for twenty years.7 He wassucceeded by his eldest son, Nathan Mayer, who became the first Lord Rothschildwhen he was raised to the peerage and took his seat in the British House ofLords in 1885. The first Lord Rothschild went on to become the governor of theBank of England, with untold power to influence the world financial system. The‘Old Lady of Threadneedle Street’ (as the Bank of England is called) has alwaysbeen, and remains, an arm of the Global Elite. The Rothschild representativesacross the world continued to manipulate events to expand their power and toserve a longer-term agenda which mirrored that of the Brotherhood: worlddomination.I stress here that to highlight the part played by the Rothschilds is not tocast aspersions on Jewish people as a whole, the vast majority of whom have noidea what is happening and certainly would not support it if they did know. Manyof the members of families I will name, like the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, andothers, do not know the game plan, either. It is those who control those empiresthat I am seeking to expose, not everyone whose name is Rothschild, Rockefeller,or whatever. I believe that researchers over the years who have blamed theentire conspiracy on the Jewish people as a whole are seriously misguided;similarly, for Jewish organisations to deny that any Jewish person is workingfor the New World Order conspiracy is equally naive and allowing dogma or worseto blind them to reality. We are looking at a common thread – a lust for powerand the All-Seeing Eye cult – which goes across all races and, in my view, isconnected – sometimes knowingly but mostly unknowingly – to a higher controllingforce: the Prison Warders of the Fourth Dimension.A Global Elite banking network was created with central banks in each countryworking together to manipulate the system across Europe and the United States.This would later be coordinated from the Bank of International Settlements inBasle, Switzerland, and a thirteen-man elite on the International BankingCommission in Geneva, Switzerland. You’ll note that Switzerland is always leftalone when Europe goes to war. This is why. It is the Global Elite financialcentre. The idea of a central bank in each country was another Eliteinspiration. The first was the Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 and then followed theBank of Hamburg (1619) and the Bank of Sweden (1661), chartered by thedescendants of bankers in Genoa and Venice. These included the Warburgs ofHamburg, who descended from the Abraham del Banco family, the biggest bankers inVenice. The manipulators behind the Bank of Amsterdam were also behind theDutch8 William of Orange who took the British throne in 1689, a feat achieved bythe manoeuvrings of the secret society called the Orange Order. The Bank ofEngland soon followed, under the charter granted by William in 1694. Someresearchers claim that all European monarchs have a connection back to William.9Resistance to the bank from members of Parliament was overcome when William tookBritain into a costly war with the French. The need to raise money made theopposition succumb to the pressure to introduce the bank, which began to lendmoney which didn’t exist to the British government. The fantastic profits itmade as a result came from the pockets of the people through income tax, and theexploitation of even poorer people throughout the British Empire. Theinstitution known as the National Debt (to the banks) was born. The RoyalPrerogative for minting money was handed over to a committee which was alsogiven the power to convert the basis of the country’s wealth to gold, which theElite controlled.A leading part of the Global Elite at the top of the human pyramid is the groupknown as the Black Nobility, from where families like the Warburgs of Hamburgdescended. These were at the forefront of the plan to put William of Orange onthe British Throne and the creation of the money system as we know it. Theyoriginate from the Guelphs, also called the Neri, or Black Guelphs, and now theBlack Nobility.10 They were the force behind the Normans, who conquered Englandin the Battle of Hastings, led by William the Conqueror in 1066. Later, whenbased in Genoa, Italy, the Black Nobility supported Robert Bruce in his conquestof Scotland and it was this same genetic line and secret society which ensuredthat William of Orange became King of England, Scotland and Ireland.11 ThroughWilliam, the Black Nobility created the Bank of England and the notorious EastIndia Company rapidly expanded to capture Asia and the Far East for the British(Global Elite) and to become the biggest drug running operation the world hadyet seen. The political and economic union of England and Scotland was designedto force Scotland into this spider’s web of money lending and control. We have aUnited Kingdom all right – united in its subservience to the manipulated moneysystem controlled by the few. The Elite bankers were now manipulating with evergreater influence across the world. They were involved in the American CivilWar, in which they financed both sides. The London Rothschilds funded the Northwhile the Paris Rothschilds funded the South.12 President Abraham Lincoln alsoprinted interest-free money, called ‘Greenbacks’, to reduce the level of debthis government would face. This was potentially disastrous for the banks. Ifthis had continued after the war and spread to other countries, the banks andthe Elite would have lost their power. Lincoln was assassinated by John WilkesBooth, an agent of the House of Rothschild, according to some researchers.13After Lincoln’s death, the printing of greenbacks was ended.The efforts to form a central banking system in the United States were alwayshighly controversial. Against opposition from two of the founding fathers,Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the first US Central Bank was introduced,thanks to the manipulation of one of their colleagues, Alexander Hamilton, whoran the Bank of New York. He was secretly backed by the Bank of England and theRothschild Empire, which were, in truth, one and the same. When GeorgeWashington, a high ranking Freemason, became President in 1789, he made Hamiltonthe Secretary to the Treasury. Within two years, Hamilton had secured hisambition with the creation of the US Central Bank, the Bank of the UnitedStates. As with the Bank of England, this was a private bank which nowcontrolled the American economy. The bank caused mayhem, and riots erupted fromthe consequences of its policies. In the 1830s, President Andrew Jackson had thecourage to take on the power of the Bank of the United States and he won. Thefirst US Central Bank was no more. Another, however, was not long in coming.In the early years of this century, the Elite was plotting to retake control ofthe US economy even more completely than before. They wanted two things: a newcentral bank with control over the nation’s borrowing and the introduction of afederal income tax to give them control of the government’s income. Again therewas serious opposition to this, but in classic ‘black-is-white’ fashion, theytricked the American Congress and people. First, the Elite supported theelection of President Woodrow Wilson in 1909. He was a front man, a politicalpuppet and a Rosicrucian. The real power of the Wilson administration was in thehands of a man called ‘Colonel’14 Edward Mandel House, who was there for noother reason than to serve the Elite. Wilson said that House was “my secondpersonality”, “my alter ego”, and that “his thoughts and mine are one”. TheElite instructed Colonel House and he instructed Woodrow Wilson, who did as hewas told. This was all happening under the pretence of ‘democracy’.The Elite bankers met at a place called Jekyl Island in Georgia to put togetherthe bill for the introduction of the new US Central Bank, the Federal ReserveSystem. They travelled in a luxurious private railroad car owned by SenatorNelson Aldrich, the political mouthpiece for the Elite in Washington, and thegrandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller (the four times Mayor of New York andthe vice president of the United States under President Ford). Aldrich’sdaughter, Abby, was married to John D. Rockefeller Jr. For years after themeeting on Jekyl Island, the ‘educators’, commentators, and ‘historians’ deniedit took place. Now this has been accepted, but it is said to have been aninsignificant event. Utter bilge. It was the moment the Elite took over the USeconomy and its people with an organisation called the Federal Reserve System,which is neither federal, nor has any reserve!In 1902, the Rothschilds sent one of their agents, Paul Warburg, to America withhis brother, Felix, to ‘rearrange’ US banking to suit Rothschild and Eliteinterests. Another brother, Max Warburg, stayed at home in Frankfurt to run thefamily banking business there. After arriving in the USA, Paul Warburg marriedNina Loeb (of the Rothschild controlled, Kuhn, Loeb, and Company) while Felixmarried Frieda Schiff, the daughter of Jacob Schiff, the head of Kuhn, Loeb, andCo Hardly surprisingly, both brothers became partners in the company and Paulwas given an annual salary of half a million dollars (in the early years of thiscentury!) to prepare the ground for the imposition of the Federal Reserve Systemon the people of the United States. It was all arranged by the Rothschilds,probably even down to the Warburg’s marriage partners. These banking and Elitefamilies like to interbreed whenever possible. It keeps the genes up to scratch,you know, and keeps the money (control) in the family. When Jacob Schiff arrivedin America to join Kuhn, Loeb, and Co, he married the daughter of Solomon Loeb.Jacob Schiff was to be one of the key manipulators in the first half of thiscentury. The Schiff and Rothschild families were as one and shared the samehouse in Frankfurt in the days of Mayer Amschel. The Federal Reserve Bill becameknown as the ‘Aldrich Bill’ and it was Warburg and Aldrich who organised thecovert meeting on Jekyl Island. Many years later, Frank Vanderlip, theRockefellers’ agent at the time, would say:> “Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the> affairs of corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I> was as secretive – indeed furtive – as a conspirator…I do not feel it is any> exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyl Island as the occasion> of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve> System.” 15The Federal Reserve System is a cartel of private banks, of which the Bank ofNew York is the most powerful. To this day it controls the US economy andthereby affects all of our lives. Through its US offshoots and connections likeJ.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb, and Co, the Rothschild Empire controlled theprincipal New York banks and, through them, the Bank of New York. This gave themcontrol of the Federal Reserve System and the American economy.16 This FederalReserve cartel is nominally controlled by the government-appointed chairman ofthe Federal Reserve Board, which is another way of saying the Elite control it.The cartel lends money that doesn’t exist to the US government and has thusensured that the country – and therefore the people – are drowning in debt tothe banks. By 1910, the behaviour of the banks had made them deeply unpopularwith the people. The Elite had to think of a way of persuading the public toaccept a banking coup on the American nation while thinking the power of thebanks was being curtailed. So when the bill the bankers had written wasintroduced by their front politicians they publicly and vehemently opposed it.This gave the impression that the bill was bad news for the banks and it waspassed into law in 1913, in the belief that it curtailed the power of the moneymanipulators. It didn’t. It gave them total control. Just to be safe, theFederal Reserve Bill was put before Congress shortly before Christmas, 1913,when many Congressmen were already at home with their families for the holiday.Now the Elite controlled the US government’s borrowing and interest rates, andit could create booms and busts whenever it wished. The way they introduced theFederal Income Tax was even more outrageous, although you have to admire theircheek. For this to be passed into law, it required the consent of at leastthirty-six states because there had to be an amendment, the sixteenth, to theUnited States Constitution. Only two states agreed. In a democracy you wouldthink that the bill would be ditched. Not so. This is no democracy! TheSecretary of State, Filander Knox, informed Congress that the necessaryagreement had been achieved and Federal Income Tax became ‘law’. Or rather, inreality, it didn’t. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which collects FederalIncome Tax and takes away the property of those who do not pay, has beenstealing from the American people for decades and continues to do so. The forcedcollection of Federal Income Tax is illegal to this day. It was never properlypassed into law. In 1985, an American businessman took the Internal RevenueService to court on this basis and won. I reprint a letter (Figure 5, overleaf)which appeared in Nexus magazine, an excellent publication which highlights themanipulation of the global conspiracy. The letter, from the Commissioner of theInternal Revenue Service to his regional directors, claims to be proof that theIRS and the US government know very well that to force people to pay federalincome tax is theft. Some people say the letter is a fake and it may well be,but if you live in America it is worth taking professional advice on your taxliability.[../Images/00019.jpg]Figure 5: This letter may well be a fake, but it outlines the themes of theconfidence trick.The power over political and human events on this planet was increased by leapsand bounds as this funny money system expanded its grip on the world. This gavethe Elite’s bankers the power to manipulate wars and revolutions, almost atwill, in league with other elements within the Brotherhood network, whichexpanded and became even more focussed on its goals during the same period thatthe banking system emerged. Another branch of the Brotherhood was officiallystarted by the German professor, Adam Weishaupt, on May 1st 1776, and thissought to infiltrate all the seats of power throughout Europe. It was called theBavarian Illuminati. The term ‘Illuminati’ means illuminated or enlightened onesand goes back to ancient times. Weishaupt’s Illuminati was designed on classicBrotherhood lines with circles of apparently unconnected people who were, behindthe scenes and without their knowledge, all manipulated and directed by the samecontrolling core at the centre. He once said: “The great strength of our Orderlies in its concealment; let it never appear in its own name, but always coveredby another name, another occupation”. That was a superb summary of theIlluminati/Global Elite approach. Some researchers suggest that it was actuallyin 1770 that Weishaupt was asked to launch the Bavarian Illuminati by theRothschilds.17The Brotherhood secret societies plotted to destroy the European monarchies,either by replacing them with republics or, less often, by removing their powerand leaving them as purely symbolic heads of state. A powerful monarch was OK ifhe or she supported Illuminati/Elite plans for the New World Order, but if theydidn’t, or if they refused to be manipulated, it acted as a serious block to theunfoldment of the plan. The manipulators could assassinate them and hope thereplacement would play the game, but you couldn’t keep doing that again andagain. Much better from the Brotherhood’s point of view to replace themonarchies with elected representatives of the people, who could be replacedevery few years. If you can control the money and the media, you can largelycontrol (a) who gets to the top in political parties and (b) whom the peopleelect into government. You give financial backing and use the secret societynetwork within all political parties to manipulate your choice to the top; youactivate your (controlled) media to advance the popularity of the one you wantto win at election time, and to undermine his or her opponent. The illusionwhich is laughingly called democracy is a wonderful vehicle for theIlluminati/Global Elite. It was their creation and the last thing you can callit is democratic.The French Revolution of 1789 was an Illuminati coup d’état, the methods ofwhich have been repeated over and over to replace undemocratic monarchies withundemocratic ‘people’s parliaments’. The only real difference between theseforms of rule was that one was clearly a dictatorship, while the other appearedto be freedom. When people are ruled by a dictator in whatever form, the timewill arrive when the desire for a say in a country’s affairs will grow withinthe people and forms of democracy will be demanded. The people living under adictator, in other words, know they are living under a dictator and eventuallythey will rebel. The system that replaced the monarchies, the ‘phoneydemocracies’ as I call them, were designed to give the illusion of ‘peoplepower’ while structuring the system to ensure that the few could run the entireshow. By manipulating events and elections via direct intervention, corruption,or media power, the Elite could pretty much be sure that their choices becamethe presidents, prime ministers, and the leading names in governments. Peopleask why those who get to the top in politics around the world are often eithercorrupt or incompetent. Well, now you know. They are meant to be. What’s more,it is harder to encourage people to rebel against the tyranny of the phoneydemocracies, because they are programmed to believe that they live in a realdemocracy. With the fall of monarchy power during the Illuminati-engineeredrevolutions, one form of dictatorship was replaced by another, but very fewnoticed!If we take a brief look at how the French Revolution unfolded, it will show youthe background strategy which the Global Elite and their Illuminati offshoot useall the time to create conflict and hoodwink the people. It began as usual witha manufactured economic crisis. A country and its people are first brought todesperate straits by poverty and economic collapse. As you will see repeatedthroughout the book, the manipulators create the circumstances in which publicopinion says: “Something must be done!” Once that stage has been achieved (byeconomic crisis, or wars, or whatever) the manipulators step forward in theguise of standing up for the people, and offer the ‘solutions’ to the problemsthey themselves have created in the first place. Those ‘solutions’ will beprecisely the measures the manipulators wanted to happen all along, as part ofthe journey to the New World Order. It is what I call theproblem-reaction-solution scenario. In this case, they wanted the people ofFrance to overturn the monarchy, and they sowed the seeds of revolt by their ageold method of poverty and debt. In his book, The Life Of Napoleon, McNair Wilsonsays of his time:> “A change of a fundamental kind had taken place in the economic structure of> Europe whereby the old basis had ceased to be wealth measured in lands, crops,> herds and minerals; but a new standard had now been introduced, namely, a form> of money to which the title ‘credit’ had been given.” 18Debts were measured in gold or silver, neither of which France produced.Therefore their debts were bound to grow and become even more impossible to pay.The Brotherhood had people on the inside as usual, including one in the keyposition of chief finance minister to King Louis. His name was Necker, a man whoclaimed to be a Swiss of German extraction. McNair Wilson wrote of him: “Neckerhad forced his way into the King’s Treasury as a representative of the debtsystem and owing allegiance to that system”.19 Necker had a reputation of beinga daring and unscrupulous speculator before joining the King’s administrationand, after four years in the treasury, he had manipulated the French finances onbehalf of the Illuminati-Elite to add another £170 million to the nationaldebt.20 With the French economy in tatters and the people growing restless intheir poverty, the Illuminati moved into stage two and began the process ofstimulating revolution. They did this through the Freemasonry network.By 1730, Freemasonry had been introduced to France from England and hadattracted notable names to its ranks, such as Phillipe Egalité, the Duke ofChartres, and the Duke of Orleans, who became a Grand Master. The Brotherhoodused such people and others to establish the first foothold of the revolution,which was more moderate in its demands. Egalité was convinced that he would bemade king of a democratic state once the existing king and queen had beenoverthrown. He had little idea of the scale of bloodletting that was to follow.It was the same with Lafayette, another revolutionary and friend of BenjaminFranklin. Lafayette wanted to see a democratic monarchy introduced under Louis,the present king. But these people were just used as vehicles to kick start therevolutionary fervour. The real manipulators knew exactly the sort of revolutionit was intended to be. Once Egalité had served his purpose he was sent to theguillotine. Many different people are misled by the Illuminati manipulators tomake sure they play their part in the overall plan, the true agenda of which iskept secret from them. Once they have done their job, they are discarded. Thosereading this book who are on the lower levels of the Brotherhood ladder mightponder deeply on this for their own sake, if not for that of others.Another Brotherhood frontman was the Marquis de Mirabeau. He is known to havebeen financed by the German, Moses Mendelssohn, a member of the Illuminati.21Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman names Mendelssohn as a key manipulator for an inner‘Jewish’ clique which he believes has been seeking to destroy Judaism and allreligion.22 He says that this clique, together with non-Jews, are followers ofwhat he, too, calls the All-Seeing Eye cult. He links this group to the House ofRothschild and says the cult was the force behind the French Revolution.Mendelssohn started the Illuminati front, the Haskala movement in 1776 – theyear the Bavarian Illuminati was launched. Another figure close to Mendelssohnwas the Illuminati member, Friedrich Nicholai. Rabbi Antelman describedMendelssohn as a “con man” who plotted the demise of Judaism while claiming tobe a promoter of the religion and the “race”. This is precisely what hashappened since and continues today. There is a global Jewish clique who are not,in truth, followers of Judaism or supporters of Jewish people. The Freemasonrylodges in France, particularly those under the control of the Grand Orient formof the order, were infiltrated by Illuminati manipulators and used to fire therevolution. In 1786, Mirabeau formed an Illuminati lodge at a meeting at theJacobin College in Paris. They became known as the Jacobins. In the same year,another All-Seeing Eye Illuminati group called the Frankists (after JacobFranks) was created in Frankfurt. One of its leading lights was Michael Hess, anemployee of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. These two groups, the Jacobins and theFrankists, were at the heart of the French Revolution.The Brotherhood plan was openly revealed when a member of Adam Weishaupt’sBavarian Illuminati was struck by lightning and killed at Ratisbon whilecarrying secret papers. These revealed the plans for world revolution and theNew World Order and they had a remarkable resemblance to the Protocols Of TheElders Of Zion, of which more shortly.23 The Bavarian government had theheadquarters of the Illuminati searched. Much more information was found and theFrench authorities were told of the plan. But events in France had by nowreached such a momentum that nothing could stop them. By 1789, more than 2,000Freemasonry lodges had affiliated with the Grand Orient organisation which, inturn, was controlled by the IIluminati. They were, themselves, controlled by theGlobal Elite.The central organisation of the revolution and the printing and distribution ofpropaganda was based at the Palais Royal, the home of Egalité. He was so in debtto the money lenders that he had to sign over his palace and estates to them.Part of the mind manipulation in any Elite/Brotherhood operation is thecharacter assassination of the opposition. One such example in the FrenchRevolution was the famous diamond necklace ‘bought’ by the Queen, MarieAntionette. She had been warned about Freemasonry by her sister in Austria someyears before, but the advice went unheeded. She had informed her sister that inFrance, Freemasonry was open and ‘everyone knows all’. The ‘open’ Freemasonswere actually planning a bloodbath at the guillotine as she wrote those words.Bitterness with the monarchy in France was further fuelled when the propagandamachine announced that the Queen had bought a diamond necklace for a quarter ofa million pounds when, in truth, it had been ordered without her knowledge by anagent of the Brotherhood, a close associate of Adam Weishaupt. This waspolitical dynamite at a time of such poverty in France. The scheme was organisedby Joseph Balsamo (real name Cagliostro), an Italian from Palermo, who wasinitiated into the Illuminati by Weishaupt.24This ‘peoples’ revolution’ continued to discard its stooges and frontmen as eachnew layer of violence unfurled. Others were introduced like Danton, Marat, andRobespierre, who would also be removed once they had been used to their fullpotential. Mobs were organised to go out onto the streets and stimulate moreviolence and unrest. In September 1792, the ‘September massacres’ came when8,000 people were killed in the prisons of Paris alone, in the name of arevolution which was supposed to be about ‘freedom’ from royal tyranny. At itscore, the revolution wasn’t even organised by French people. As Sir Walter Scottsaid in his Life Of Napoleon: “The principal leaders of the…[revolution]…seem tohave been foreigners”.25 Robespierre was said to be the leading light of therevolution as it gathered pace, but this was just another smokescreen. In hisbook, The Life Of Robespierre, G. Renier, says:> “On the 28th July, 1794, Robespierre made a long speech against ultra> terrorists…uttering vague general accusations. ‘I dare not name them at this> moment and in this place. I cannot bring myself entirely to tear asunder the> veil that covers this profound mystery of antiquity. But I can affirm most> positively that among the authors of this plot are agents of that system of> corruption and extravagance, the most powerful of all the means invented by> foreigners for the undoing of the Republic; I mean the impure apostles of> atheism and the immorality that is at its base’.”At 2am that night, Robespierre was shot and the next day he was taken to theguillotine. He was getting too close to speaking the truth about the ‘glorious’French Revolution, and in the strange world of the Illuminati/Elite, that meanthe had to go. Think on that, those of you in the Brotherhood who believe you arein control of events. Stop now, let me have the information you have about whatis going on, and get the hell out of it before you become another Robespierre orEgalité! From the French Revolution we can see the elements of manipulated warsand revolutions that are common to all the ‘peoples’ uprisings’ in Europe whichousted the monarchies and to conflicts around the world up to the present day.These are: the financial crisis to create suffering and the desire for change(“Something must be done”); the duping of influential people who support the‘cause’ without realising the real agenda; the dumping of these people when theyhave served their purpose; the mass propaganda to exploit the public’s naturalsense of injustice, to disinform, and to lead opinion in the desired direction;the lies told about opponents of the plan and the assassination of theircharacter to the point where people have great hatred for them; the organisationof ‘rent-a-mob’ to cause agitation and encourage others to overthrow theestablished order; and, finally, the installation of a phoney democracy oralternative dictatorship.Look at the background of any revolution or war and you will see most, usuallyall, of these methods at work. This system I am describing is the means throughwhich the extraterrestrial Prison Warders and the Luciferic Consciousness on thenon-physical frequencies around this planet, project their control into thephysical world as the Global Elite/Illuminati/Brotherhood network. Divide andrule, control of the flow of information, secret manipulation, and conflict.Over the last three hundred thousand years or so, all these methods of controlby the Prison Warders can be seen in the Elite network on Earth. One is merelyanother level of the other. Revolution and war continued throughout Europeduring the ninteenth century, much of it coordinated by Lord Palmerston, theBritish Prime Minister, who directed the policies of his country to carry outthe designs of the Illuminati. Lord Palmerston was the Grand Patriach or GrandMaster of Grand Orient Freemasonry – another name for the Illuminati.It was Palmerston who was prime minister during the ‘opium wars’ when Britainforced the Chinese to import opium, a policy which addicted the population andmade them easy to control. One result was the British ownership of Hong Kong,from where Britain ran its drug trade and, with the Americans and Chinese, stilldoes.There was another ambition on the Prison Warder/Global Elite agenda during thisperiod: the end of God in the human mind. The Elite’s god is the LucifericConsciousness, but they wanted the human mind to reject all beliefs in eternallife and believe in mortality, finality, and materialistic ‘science’. This wouldturn human consciousness into an even greater slave to this material level. Inthe very late 1800s, a controversial document came to light called the ProtocolsOf The Elders Of Zion. I call them the Illuminati Protocols and I quote manyextracts from them in The Robots’ Rebellion. Some say they were a forgery madepublic only to discredit Jews, and I use the term ‘Illuminati Protocols’ to getaway from the Jewish emphasis. If they were a forgery, something that is quitepossible, what were they a forgery of, and by whom? The authors of thebest-selling book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, conclude that the original Protocolswere indeed authentic. They suggest that they were the work of an elite groupcalled The Priory of Sion, the inner, controlling, core of the KnightsTemplars.26 They believe that this original document was changed to make itappear as a Jewish plot. I certainly would not dismiss such a conclusion. It isthe manipulation they describe that interests me, not who has been blamed forit. I believe their origin lies with the Illuminati, as does Rabbi Antelman.Whatever the arguments, one fact cannot be denied, given the hindsight of thelast 100 years. The Protocols, from wherever they came, were a quite stunningprophecy of what has happened in the twentieth century in terms of wars and themanipulation I am exposing here. Whoever wrote them sure as heck knew what thegame plan was. One protocol speaks of the way the manipulators intended todestroy the idea of God in as many human minds as possible:> “It is with this object in view that we are constantly, by means of our press,> arousing a blind confidence in these [scientific] theories.

He suggested in themid-1800s that the potential of the mind is developed by genetic inheritance.This is patent nonsense, but it did provide the justification for the eugenics(racial purity) movement that would follow and lead both to Adolf Hitler and thepopulation control policies of today. His work, Origin Of Species, to give it ashortened title, was to become the basis for ‘scientific’ thinking and itsmindset dominates what we bravely call science to this day. His most famoustheory, that of the survival of the fittest, didn’t even appear in the firstfour editions. He lifted it from the writings of a contemporary, HerbertSpencer, who had lifted it from someone else. The word ‘evolution’ did notappear until the sixth edition, in 1872. I understand that even Darwin didn’tbelieve his theory by the end of his life, and he thought God created humanbeings. But his Origin Of Species went on to take over ‘scientific’ thoughtanyway. It was designed by the Elite to do just that. Darwin was another stooge.He was the frontman for a coup on the human mind which was coordinated over manyyears. A small group of people known as the Lunar Society in Birmingham,England, was significant in this. The group continued its influence under thename of the London-based Royal Society, which is still one of the mostinfluential bodies in the world with regard to science. The Royal Society wasfounded by the Order of the Rosy Cross in the reign of Charles II. Anotherfamous ‘scientific’ influence, Sir Isaac Newton, was a Rosicrucian and GrandMaster of the Priory of Sion, the inner core of the Knights Templar. He was aninspiration behind the founding of the Royal Society. Researchers into thebackground of the Lunar Society have shown that it mirrored (with remarkableaccuracy) a group called the Invisible College, described in the Francis Baconwork, The New Atlantis. It was known as the Lunar Society because it met once amonth at the time of the full moon. Among its members were Benjamin Franklin,one of the founders of the United States and close associate of Frenchrevolutionaries, and…Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin, the manwho would later be the frontman for this-world-is-all-there-is. What acoincidence! Another member of the Lunar Society was the Unitarian, JosiahWedgwood, founder of the famous pottery, and his daughter was to become themother of Charles Darwin after she married Dr Robert Darwin, the son of ErasmusDarwin. Nothing like keeping it in the family!Six of the Lunar Society’s members were educated at Edinburgh University, as wasCharles Darwin. The society was a revolutionary organisation which supported theoverthrowing of the monarchies and the undermining of God in the human beliefsystem. Benjamin Franklin became a sort of shuttle ‘diplomat’ for the cause, inthe same way that Henry Kissinger would come to be in the second half of thiscentury. I cannot recommend too highly the book by the Canadian scientist andresearcher, Ian T. Taylor, called In The Minds Of Men: Darwin And The New WorldOrder. This reveals the story of how modern ‘scientific’ theory was manufacturedand sold as truth to mislead the human mind. With detailed, documented evidence,Taylor dismantles the edifice of the scientific establishment, its beliefs,claims, and manipulation. Every student of science would benefit enormously fromreading it.But, of course, most people don’t read such evidence. They go through theschools and university system and absorb all the accepted claptrap thatoriginates from Darwin’s time. This affects the way many of them see themselvesand life in general, and, as we have discussed, they create that reality in theworld around them. It is a world of “What’s the point? We are only cosmicaccidents after all, and life is about the survival of the fittest. No room forsentiment; it’s everyone for themselves”. A movement which has emerged from theDarwin view of life is called Humanism, another vehicle for manipulation, eventhough the overwhelming majority of its advocates will not realise it. Stilltoday, organisations like the Committee for the Scientific [sic] Investigationof Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) do all they can to discredit anyexplanations or phenomena which expose establishment science as a fraud. Onevehement British campaigner against alternative scientific explanation is SusanBlackmore, who is wheeled onto television programmes galore to defend theestablishment line against all challenge. The padlock on such minds defies myimagination.In our brief history of the conspiracy, we are now in the early years of thetwentieth century. The manipulators have created the banking and financialsystem, introduced this-world-is-all-there-is science, and they have, throughengineered revolution, installed a series of phoney democracies which theycontrol and direct while the people think they are free. In their misguidedminds (controlled by the Prison Warders on the Fourth Dimension), the time wasright to launch the next stage on the road to the New World Order.

And those who have reached the top ofthe human pyramid are always on the lookout for people of the right calibre andattitude who can take over from them, as the earthly representations of thePrison Warders. The knowledge of the New World Order agenda and the methods ofmanipulation are also passed on across the generations of certain families,which makes the process easier.I believe that the same streams of consciousness have been constantlyincarnating, ‘dying’, and reincarnating over the thousands of years to keep theplan going.Just as those wishing to free humanity are supported from other frequencies ofreality, so are those in the Elite/Illuminati/Brotherhood network. A commontheme among many people involved is an interest in the ‘black’ occult and a wishto communicate with extraterrestrial ‘supermen’ – the Fourth Dimensional PrisonWarders. The methods of communication are very much the same for those who wantfreedom and for those who want control. It is the intent behind suchcommunications which differs. The Elite have thoughts and information fed intotheir consciousness to guide them and so do those challenging this structure. Weon Earth are vehicles for a spiritual tussle happening on another level of thisplanet, not only this one.The Round TableCecil Rhodes was a fabulously wealthy Englishman who exploited the continent andpeoples of Africa, and particularly the diamond reserves of South Africa. Thename Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, is an indication of his influence in that part ofthe world. As a student at Oxford University, Rhodes was inspired by a fine artsprofessor called John Ruskin, who is still considered a legendary figure atOxford. Ruskin was born in London in 1819, the son of a wealthy wine merchant,and inherited a large fortune. His hero was the ancient Greek philosopher,Plato, whose works he read almost every day. Plato had a brilliant mind and madea great contribution to human debate and knowledge, but some of his views on howto structure a society by top-down imposition could hardly be further from myown. Ruskin was a believer in the New World Order agenda of centralised power,and he felt the State should control the means of production and distribution.This was the same philosophy followed by the early British Labour Party beforeit became the alternative Conservative Party it is today. Ruskin, however, wentfurther and believed the control of the State could be in the hands of onedictator of superior intellect to the rest of society. Some researchers say hewas a supporter of the Illuminati. Ruskin probably genuinely wanted betterconditions for the poor, but I would suggest that he was seriously misguided inhis means of achieving them. His ideas were to be followed by Karl Marx andFriedrich Engels (another student of Plato) and became the foundations of theMarxist form of communism which was soon to grip the nations of Eastern Europe.Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman also identifies the Plato theme and its connection tothe All-Seeing Eye secret society network. He points out that Moses Mendelssohn,an architect of the French Revolution, was such a student of Plato’s works thathe became known as the “German Plato”. He translated three books of Plato’sRepublic into German, but his work was never published. It was, however, passeddown through the Warburg banking family, the subordinates of the Rothschilds,and creators of the Federal Reserve.1 The Warburgs, like the Rothschilds, wouldlater help to fund Adolf Hitler. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati,was another Plato groupie and high initiate of the All-Seeing Eye stream ofoccult ‘thinking’.The views of John Ruskin and his articulate promotion of them brought about arevolution in the thinking of the privileged undergraduates of Oxford and someat Cambridge, too. Rhodes copied Ruskin’s inaugural lecture in longhand and keptit with him for the rest of his life. The creation of a world government centredon Britain became Rhodes’s obsession and lay at the heart of almost everythinghe did. As his wealth grew with his exploitation of South African diamonds andminerals, he established companies like DeBeers Consolidated Mines andConsolidated Gold Fields. He also became the Prime Minister of the Cape Colonyand used his wealth and influence to control parliamentary seats in Britain andSouth Africa. By the 1890s, he had an income of at least a million pounds a year(over a hundred years ago!), but he was usually overdrawn on his account, suchwas his ability to spend. A large amount went to furthering his aims of a worldgovernment. Rhodes is claimed to have been a member of an elite group known asthe Committee of 300, also known as the Olympians. This organisation was thesubject of a book by Dr John Coleman called Conspirators Hierarchy: The Story OfThe Committee Of 300. Coleman claims to have been an intelligence officer inBritain’s MI6. From this point I will identify those named by Dr Coleman withthe abbreviation (Comm 300). This organisation consists of leading people inpolitics, commerce, banking, the media, the military etc, who are working towardthe goal of total global power.Rhodes’s2 idea was to set up a secret society which would manipulate events in away that would lead to the introduction of centralised global control. Thissociety is known by several names but, for simplicity, I will call it throughoutby one of them: the Round Table. It was structured on Illuminati and Freemasoniclines. There was an inner circle, the Society of the Elect (or Initiates), whoknew exactly what the game and the aim was, and an outer Circle of Friends, madeup of influential people who could help the cause, but who didn’t always knowthe full implications or ambitions of the Round Table. The Table’s manipulatorswere mostly those with the real power rather than those with the appearance ofpower. Its members were usually not recorded in history like the famouspoliticians and military leaders, but they controlled events far more than thosedocumented by the history books.Lord Astor (Comm 300) was a member of the Round Table inner elite and he was anexample of another key area of control by the Elite: the media. He would laterown The Times newspaper. Still today, the power lies not with politicians, butwith the shadowy figures who ‘advise’ and control them, and those who manipulatethe flow of information into the public arena. The Round Table, anotherRothschild creation, plotted the Boer War in South Africa of 1899–1902, in whichtens of thousands of men, women, and children were killed, many of them in theconcentration camps established by Lord Kitchener (Comm 300). The British PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister at the time was Lord Salisbury (Comm 300), of theelite Cecil family, a close friend of Winston Churchill (Comm 300). LordSalisbury and the Cecil family were key players in the Rhodes-Round Tableoperation. Manipulation by the Round Table secured British control of themineral wealth and introduced the Union of South Africa. Nathan (Baron)Rothschild was a member of the Round Table which represented the interests ofthe House of Rothschild and the bankers they controlled such as the Warburgs,Schroders, and Lazards. J.P. Morgan (Comm 300) became a member in 1899.When Rhodes died in 1902, he bequeathed his funds to the cause. These continuedto support the Round Table to an extent, although much of the funding came fromthe House of Rothschild. In his will, Rhodes also created a system of subsidisedscholarships which continue to this day. This was, in part, a front to hide thesecret society. Selected overseas students are brought to Oxford University tobe taught the British view of life and to be sold the idea of a worldgovernment. It is remarkable how many ‘Rhodes Scholars’, as they are called, goon to become leaders of countries or heads of intelligence agencies, education,and other subject areas important to the Elite, or ‘advisors’ to those leaders.The most famous Rhodes Scholar in the world today is Bill Clinton, who wasinaugurated as President of the United States in 1993. Oxford University,particularly the colleges of All Souls, Balliol, and New College, becamedominated by the Round Table, and this continued after Rhodes’s death whenAlfred Milner (Comm 300), a Rothschild agent, took over the leadership. He, too,was an ardent follower of Ruskin, as were the group of former Oxford andCambridge students whom Milner recruited for the Round Table and later, theRoyal Institute of International Affairs. Under Milner’s stewardship, the RoundTable’s influence grew and went on to enjoy tremendous power at the heart ofgovernment. Among its inner membership was Arthur Balfour (Comm 300),3 theForeign Secretary and Prime Minister, whose ‘Balfour Declaration’ would, ineffect, bring the State of Israel into being.In the years that followed, the Round Table controlled the London Timesnewspaper and other publications. It introduced the term ‘a Commonwealth ofNations’ and ensured that the idea became a reality. Through Milner, it was thechief influence in the British War Cabinet of Lloyd George (Comm 300) in theFirst World War. It would dominate the British delegation at the ‘Peace’Conference of 1919, when the shape of the post-war world and German reparationpayments were decided. It was also the major power behind the creation of theLeague of Nations, the first attempt at a world government by stealth. The RoundTable decided British policy in Ireland, Palestine, and India from 1917–1945 andcontrolled (in the words of researcher Carroll Quigley) “the sources and writingof the history of British Imperial and foreign policy since the Boer War”,4 toan overwhelming extent. The rewriting of history is a vital part of the Elite’sstrategy because the way we perceive history fundamentally affects the way wesee the world and each other today. George Orwell made the point in his book,1984, that those who control history control the present, and those who controlthe present control history.Other branches of the Round Table were set up in other countries. By 1915, therewere Round Table groups in Britain, South Africa, Canada, Australia, NewZealand, India, and the United States. The coordination between them wasimproved by the publication of the society’s magazine, The Round Table, whichbegan in November, 1910. The ‘achievements’ I’ve listed, which have had such aneffect on our lives to the present day, were not the result of democraticdecision making, but of the manoeuvrings of a secret society called The RoundTable, working from its own agenda. Carroll Quigley, a professor at GeorgetownUniversity, was an ‘insider’ who was given access to secret papers on the NewWorld Order conspiracy. He broke ranks and revealed in great detail what washappening behind the scenes in the first fifty years of this century. He wrotein his book, The Anglo-American Establishment:> “The picture is terrifying because such power, whatever the goals at which it> may be directed, is too much to be entrusted safely to any group…No country> that values its safety should allow what the Milner group accomplished – that> is, that a small number of men would be able to wield such power in> administration and politics, should be given almost complete control over the> publication of documents relating to their actions, should be able to exercise> such influence over the avenues of information that create public opinion, and> should be able to monopolise so completely the writing and teaching of the> history of their own period.” 5It is equally sobering to think that even though the Round Table network wasdirecting the policies of the then most powerful country and empire in theworld, the people didn’t know such an organisation existed, never mind what itwas doing. Ask anyone today, including most historians, about the Rhodes andMilner Round Table and they will reply, “the Round what?” The hidden hand thatcontrols the direction of the world is indeed very well hidden from the publiceye. The Round Table extended its influence across the Atlantic to the UnitedStates. It was there that the power blocs which would control political andeconomic policy and the communications industry – to the present day – werebeing assembled in the early years of this century. These were the organisationsand the businesses of the so called ‘Eastern Establishment’, which work inconcert with the British and European Round Table members under a common globalpolicy. Among the central players and financial supporters of the Round Table inthe United States were the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the companies andtrusts in the nexus around the Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, and Whitney families,along with others linked to the international financiers in London like theRothschilds and Lazard Brothers. All these people were supporters of the worldgovernment ideals of the New World Order. The Round Table interconnected closelywith other branches of the Elite including Freemasonry and, in the USA, with thesinister secret society based at Yale University known as the Skull and BonesSociety. I will explain much more about this later. For now, I need only saythat many of the influential American names behind the First World War and theBolshevik Revolution were members of or had connections with the Skull and BonesSociety.The two names which dominated the Elite/Round Table network in America wereRockefeller and Morgan, who were both closely connected with and probablycontrolled by the Rothschilds (Comm 300). The Rockefellers (real name,Rockenfelder) are at the heart of the New World Order deception to this veryday. J.D. Rockefeller started his Standard Oil Company in 1853 to produce thefuel for oil lamps, but, as the potential for oil was realised, it became aglobal company with tremendous power. In the early years of this century, theRockefeller empire encompassed scores of other industries and interests,including railways and banks. They owned or controlled the National City Bank,the Hanover National Bank, the United States Trust Company, and leadinginsurance companies like Equitable Life and Mutual of New York. The Morganempire was founded on steel, shipping, and the electricity industry, includingGeneral Electric. In the financial sector, the National Bank of Commerce, NewYork Life Insurance, and the Guaranty Trust Company, the biggest trust companyin America, were all Morgan companies at that time.6 Morgan/Rockefeller werequite a twosome, and no US government or politician could rule without theirconsent. They were in league with other American families of the Anglo-Americanpolitical, banking, and business cartels in the Eastern Establishment, includingthe Dulles family. John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen will be anothercommon thread in our story from the First World War to the Kennedyassassination. John Foster Dulles would become US Secretary of State and Allen,the head of the CIA.One other name I should mention here is a family which will appear many times:Harriman. Edward Harriman started work at the age of fourteen with littleeducation, but his fortunes changed after he married Mary Averell, the daughterof a New York banker and railroad president. Harriman built his own fortune withthe Union Pacific Railroad, but he was a notoriously corrupt and ruthlessbusinessman. In 1904, he was found guilty of a fraud which earned him $60million in a deal that also implicated the Rothschild company, Kuhn Loeb and Co.Harriman stayed out of jail only by insider influence with politicians and theirparties. His case was helped enormously by a $250,000 donation to the RepublicanNational Committee of President Theodore Roosevelt. The Skull and Bones Societywas working secretly in the background too. Roosevelt had earlier describedHarriman as a man of ‘deep-seated corruption’, but the quarter of a milliondollars helped the President to see him in a new light. Harriman money wasinvolved in funding the Bolsheviks and both sides of the First World War. He andthe Rockefellers provided part of the start-up capital for the Morgan GuarantyTrust, which was to be the vehicle for enormous manipulation of world events.Edward Harriman had two sons, Averell and Roland, both pillars of the Skull andBones Society. Averell (Comm 300) was to become one of the most activemanipulators of the twentieth century.But who was really behind these American business and banking giants? The J.P.Morgan empire began in 1838 as George Peabody and Company, in England. It hadconnections with the firm of Brown Brothers (later Brown Brothers, Harriman).George Peabody was working secretly as an agent of the Rothschilds as early as1835 7 and he became known as Queen Victoria’s ‘favourite American’. A statue ofGeorge Peabody can be seen opposite the Bank of England today and his oldlunchbox is still given a prominent place at the London office of the MorganStanley Bank. Peabody, the Rothschild frontman, became the biggest trader inAmerican securities in the world; with his partner, John Peirpont Morgan (Comm300), he put enormous pressure on the administration of Abraham Lincoln tomanipulate the US economy for their personal benefit. Peabody had no sons andwhen he died his business was passed to Morgan’s son, John Peirpont Morgan Jr(Comm 300), who was born in New York in 1867. This second J.P. Morgan was seen,like his father, as an all-powerful banker at the helm of his own empire, but hewas almost certainly a vehicle for the House of Rothschild. Morgan was a directdescendent of Alexander Hamilton, the man who engineered the first US CentralBank, the Bank of the United States, in support of Rothschild interests. Whenthe first J.P. Morgan died in 1913, he left only $11 million, a very modest sum,considering his reputation and the fortunes left by others. This is most likelyto have been because he was a frontman for the Rothschilds and not all-powerfulin his own right. The Wall Street reporter, Lincoln Steffens, interviewed bothJ.P. Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller, and he realised that they were not the realpower behind their empires. “No-one ever seems to ask the question ‘who isbehind the Morgans and Rockefellers?’”, he once wrote. It is noteworthy, too,that the Morgans had a reputation for being anti-Jewish while in fact workingclosely with the Rothschilds. This ploy of “anti-Semitism” is often used tocamouflage Rothschild interests. The Rothschilds were most powerfullyrepresented in the United States by the banking company known as Kuhn, Loeb, andCo. It was founded in 1867 by Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb, two merchants fromCincinnati, but it became an obvious Rothschild front after 1875, when JacobSchiff arrived from Frankfurt. Schiff was born in the Rothschild/Schiff house inFrankfurt, which the two families shared. The business arrangements betweenSchiff and Kuhn, Loeb, and Co were consummated (as so often happens in thesecases) by the marriage of Schiff to Solomon Loeb’s daughter, Therese. Schiffbrought Rothschild capital into the firm and ran it as a Rothschild front.George R. Conroy wrote in the December, 1912 issue of Truth magazine:> “Mr Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co,> which represents the Rothschild interests on this side of the Atlantic. He has> been described as a financial strategist and has been for years the financial> minister of the great impersonal power known as Standard Oil. He was> hand-in-glove with the Harrimans, the Goulds, and the Rockefellers in all> their railroad enterprises and has become the dominant power in the railroad> and financial power of America.”Schiff was the United States representative of the Rothschilds, a family whowere supposed to have little influence or interest in America! It was also aRothschild bank, the National City Bank of Cleveland, which financed the earlyexpansion of the Rockefellers and the Harrimans. The Rockefellers and theRothschilds (via Kuhn Loeb) would eventually merge some of their bankinginterests to form the Chase Manhattan Bank, one of the most influential bankingoperations in the world today.In the early years of this century, the Elite’s control was tightened stillfurther and the structure became even more focussed and efficient. From the timeof Cecil Rhodes, the Round Table Secret Society spawned a network ofinterconnecting groups in many countries working toward a common aim. But thetwo most important strongholds of the Round Table were Britain and the UnitedStates. At the Elite level were certain families and individuals on both sidesof the Atlantic who worked together covertly in pursuit of the goal of worldgovernment, a world central bank, a world currency, and a world army. Thetechnology for electronic money and a microchipped population would be addedlater. By now, certain names were appearing which would be involved in almosteverything of global significance in the decades that followed: names likeRockefeller, Rothschild, Morgan, Harriman, Milner, Dulles, Warburg, Roosevelt,House, and Baruch. These names will become familiar as the conventional view ofhistory is overturned.Such names and organisations within the Elite/Illuminati/Brotherhood networkhave been behind the two World Wars, the Russian Revolution, the rise of AdolfHitler, and the constant manipulation of the financial system. These events havekept humanity in fear and division, exactly as required. But it is a fairquestion to ask why would they support fascism, communism, and capitalism at thesame time? And how could this help their plans for the New World Order? This hasto be seen on many levels. Financially, wars and revolutions are very profitablefor the bankers and suppliers. But there are wider reasons behind this. If youwant nations to give up their sovereignty and hand over decisions and power to aworld authority, it won’t just happen. You have to make it happen by causingconflict between nations on the principle of problem-reaction-solution. TheElite, working in part through the Round Table network, wanted to cause so muchpain and war between nation states that the public would say “something must bedone”. This something was intended to be a world authority all along.They would try first to introduce this as the League of Nations after World WarI and when that didn’t quite work, another World War led to the United Nations.Both of these organisations were promoted as a means to keep the peace amongnations by – to use Winston Churchill’s famous phrase – “jaw, jaw, not war,war”. But they were both Trojan horses for a global government, central bank,currency, and army. Look at what is happening within the United Nations todayand you’ll see how far the UN has already moved in this direction. The strategythe Elite/Round Table used in the two World Wars, the Russian Revolution, andcountless other conflicts throughout this century has been attributed to a mancalled Hegel, although, in fact, this strategy was not developed by Hegel assuch. His work was only a trigger for others who developed and changed histhinking to create a sinister phenomena. Hegel, himself, appears to have been avery genuine man. Put simply, the modified version of his thinking can bedescribed as ‘crisis management’, which appears uncontrolled, but is, in fact,extremely calculated. ‘Managed conflict’ and ‘controlled choice’ would be evenmore accurate descriptions. The idea is to create the war and then win the peacein the way you restructure the devastated post-war world.George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher, born in Stuttgart in1770. During his life he could never have known what an effect a modified,materialistic version of the phenomena he identified would have on the worldfrom that day to this. His observations about the spiritual development of themind were developed and changed by others, including Karl Marx, and thismodified version of Hegelianism expressed itself thus: If you create twoopposing sides and bring them into conflict, you will create a third force, asynchronisation of both of them. It is known as thesis v antithesis = synthesis:a new order. Marx, a German, the inspiration of the Bolshevik revolutionaries,was a keen student of Hegel’s work. The difference between them was that Hegelwas talking of the spirit and mind while Marx rejected the idea of God and anafterlife. He was a materialist. To him, this world was all there was (or so hesaid publicly). As he once said: “I turned Hegel on his head”. In doing so, hehad also identified an incredibly effective tool in manipulating the worldtowards centralised control.Marx and his German industrialist friend, Friedrich Engels, produced theCommunist Manifesto. Engels, the promoter of freedom for the masses from theyoke of capitalism, had made a fortune exploiting child labour in Lancashire,England. The Communist Manifesto was nothing new and certainly not theinspiration of Karl Marx. He got his ‘ideas’ from the works of others, which heread during his countless hours in the British Museum. His belief in a class warcame from Weishaupt and the Bavarian Illuminati. As the American researcher,Gary Allen, writes in his 1972 book None Dare Call It Conspiracy:> “In actual fact the ‘Communist Manifesto’ was in circulation for many years> before Marx’s name was widely enough recognised to establish his authorship> for this revolutionary handbook. All Karl Marx really did was to update and> codify the very same revolutionary plans and principles set down seventy years> earlier by Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Order of the Illuminati in> Bavaria.”Marx was a member of a secret society in the Elite/Illuminati/Brotherhoodnetwork, called the League of the Just, which later became the Communist League.The League of the Just was an offshoot of the Society of the Seasons, whichplayed a leading role in the French Revolution. Once again our eyes turn toGermany, birthplace of the Bavarian Illumaniti. The League of the Just wascalled the Bund Der Gerechtan or simply the Bund. This was the force behind therise of Marxism and he was yet another front man. Interestingly, May 1st (‘MayDay’), was chosen as the annual celebration for Marxist-Leninist and socialistcountries and groups around the world. The Bavarian Illuminati, the creator ofthe Bund, was founded on May 1st 1776. Marx had close connections with theBritish aristocracy through his marriage to Jenny von Westphalen, who wasrelated to the Scottish Dukes of Argyll and the Campbells. One of her ancestors,Anna Campbell, the Countess of Balcarras and Argyll, was the governess to thePrince of Orange, later King William, who granted the charter to the Bank ofEngland and caused such untold misery in Ireland. Archibald Campbell, the firstDuke of Argyll, travelled with William on his journey to England to take thethrone in 1688. The present Earl of Balcarras is related to Viscount Cowdray(Weetman John Churchill Pearson), whose mother was the daughter of Lord SpencerChurchill. These were some of the connections around the ‘people’srevolutionary’, Karl Marx.[../Images/00021.jpg]Figure 6A tiny elite are coordinating all these apparently unconnected events. So whenyou see how the same people support and fund ‘opposites’ like Marxism-Leninism,fascism, and capitalism, it is not because they are confused or crazy. They arecreating the opposing ‘sides’ which can then be brought into conflict to playone off against the other and create another force – New World Orderism. Thesisv antithesis = synthesis. This was expressed most obviously and destructively inthe way the Elite created, funded, and brought capitalism and communism intoconflict against fascism in the Second World War (Figure 6). This created thedesired synthesis: the United Nations and the European Community. The ‘Cold War’between capitalism and communism is leading to another synthesis following theElite-inspired ‘people’s revolutions’ throughout the former Soviet Union. Peoplehave been sold the line that political beliefs can be expressed at one extremeby communism (the far Left) and at the other by fascism (the far Right). This ispart of the illusion to hide from us what is really going on. Fascism andcommunism are not opposites; they are merely promoted as such. Both involvecentral control by a tiny elite. The political spectrum is really freedom ofexpression, thought, and lifestyle at one end and authoritarianism(fascism/Marxism-Leninism) at the other. Yet we have people who are Marxistsattacking fascists for their authoritarian policies and vice-versa! These‘opposites’ are Elite-created to give the illusion of extremes which they canthen use to create the conflict that leads to synthesis – the centralised globalinstitutions they seek. And the political ‘radicals’, or what I call the ‘RobotRadicals’, have been duped into playing a crucial role in this. They still are.By using the modified Hegel philosophy, the Elite and all these families andorganisations have been involved in so much manipulation of the human race, thatit would take a library of books to tell the full story. Even then, theinterconnection and cross-referencing of names and organisations would be socomplex as to be hardly comprehensible. Boring you to death is not my ambition.At the same time, I want to include enough detail to show that the idea that anelite few can and do control the world and your life is no ‘theory’, butprovable fact. Therefore, in the rest of this chapter, I’m going to concentrateon the three major events in the early years of this century which show that theversion of history we are given in the schools and the media is considerablyless than the truth. Those events are the First World War, the RussianRevolution, and the creation of the State of Israel. The same few peoplemanipulated all of them.The First World WarKaiser Wilhelm II was ruler of Germany in the early years of this century, butElite-placed men in his administration were manipulating policy, just as theywere in Great Britain (Milner) and in the United States (Colonel House). Theassassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,was used as the excuse for war, but the conflict had been decided upon longbefore. The Austrians accused Serbia of the murder and declared war. Theassassination was carried out on June 28th 1914 by a Serbian Secret Society,controlled by the Elite, called the Black Hand. Ferdinand went with his wife toSarajevo in Bosnia. Six assassins were waiting for him as his car was driven tohis appointment. As the car went past them, all six failed to kill him and theArchduke appeared to have survived the attack. But his chauffeur became‘confused’, took a ‘wrong turning’, and finally stopped the car in front of oneof the would-be assassins, Gavrilo Princip, who took full advantage of hissecond opportunity. Ferdinand had told his friend, Count Czerin, that he knew anattempt on his life was imminent because he had been told the year before thatthe Freemasons had decided to kill him. Meanwhile – at exactly the same time inRussia – Grigory Yefimovitch Rasputin, the Tsar’s most influential advisor (whoopposed the war), was being attacked with a knife in an unsuccessfulassassination attempt in Pokrovskoe. As author Colin Wilson says in his book,Rasputin:> “There are fifty degrees of longitude between Sarajevo and Pokrovskoe, which> means that eleven o’clock in Sarajevo is about 2.15 in Pokrovskoe. It is a> strange coincidence that two assassins struck at almost exactly the same> moment – a coincidence that makes one inclined to doubt the ‘blindness of> history’. Ferdinand’s death made war probable; Rasputin’s injury made it> certain, for he was the only man in Russia capable of averting it.”Kaiser Wilhelm, urged on by his Brotherhood advisors, supported Austria anddeclared war on Russia and France. The ‘Great War’ was underway. One of its mainarchitects was the Kaiser’s Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, a member of theBethmann banking family in Frankfurt and a cousin of the Rothschilds.8 Britaincame in against Germany, and the United States followed suit in 1917. Americawas always going to enter the war, as public opinion was whipped up by themedia. Kent Cooper, the President of Associated Press, wrote in the November13th 1944 issue of Life:> “Before and during the First World War, the great German news agency, Wolff,> was owned by the European banking house of Rothschild, which had its central> headquarters in Berlin. A leading member of the firm was also Kaiser Wilhelm’s> personal banker (Max Warburg). What actually happened in Imperial Germany was> that the Kaiser used Wolff to bind and excite his people to such a degree that> they were eager for World War I. Twenty years later under Hitler the pattern> was repeated and enormously magnified by DNB, Wolff’s successors.”In his autobiography, Barriers Down, Cooper added that the House of Rothschildbought an interest in the three leading European news agencies: Wolff inGermany, Havas in France, and Reuters in England. For those who don’t know howthe media works, the news agencies provide news stories to all papers and mediaoutlets, so what they say is often repeated by the whole of the media. “It mustbe true because they’re all saying it” is what I hear people say. They are allsaying it because they are printing the same information from the same source –the news agency. It is worth noting that on April 28th 1915, Baron Herbert deReuter, the head of the Reuters agency, ‘committed suicide’. This followed thecollapse of the Reuters Bank. The Baron was replaced by Sir Roderick Jones, whoreports in his autobiography that “…Shortly after I succeeded Baron Herbert deReuter in 1915, it so happened that I received an invitation from Mr AlfredRothschild, then head of the British House of Rothschild, to lunch with him atthe historic New Court, in the City”. What they discussed, he declines toreveal. What do you think?Amazing as it may seem at first, the connections between the Jewish House ofRothschild and the creation of World Wars (in which so many Jewish peoplesuffered appallingly) are beginning to mount.It was part of the Elite’s strategy to involve the US and increase the post-wardemands for a world authority to stop further wars. This was not too much of aproblem because the president, Woodrow Wilson, did whatever his chief ‘advisor’,Colonel House (Comm 300), told him to do. In 1915, the German sinking of theAmerican ‘passenger’ ship, the Lusitania, was an excuse for the US to declarewar, just as the assassination of Ferdinand had been for the Germans, and theattack on Pearl Harbor would be for the Americans in World War II. The Lusitaniawas sailed into an area of known German U-boat activity without an escort, andthe people on board were sacrificed to satisfy the Elite’s horrific ambitions.In the archives of the US Treasury Department, President Wilson concealed proofthat the Lusitania was carrying military supplies for the British.9 It was notthe ‘passengers-only’ vessel it was claimed to be as part of the propaganda tooutrage American public opinion. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt of the EasternEstablishment family was on the Lusitania when it sank. A telegram had beendelivered to the ship before it left New York warning Vanderbilt not to sail,but it never reached him and it cost him his life. Someone obviously knewexactly what was planned.The manipulation of America into the war was coordinated through three mainorganisations: the Council on National Defense, the Navy League, and the Leagueto Enforce Peace. Among the members of the Council on National Defense was theRothschild agent, Bernard Baruch. As head of the War Industries Board during thewar, Baruch had, in his own words “…probably more power than perhaps any otherman did in the war…”.10 The Navy League was dominated by J.P. Morgan. Among theprincipals of the League to Enforce Peace were Elihu Root, J.P. Morgan’s lawyer;Perry Belmont,11 the Rothschild’s US agent; and Jacob Schiff of the Rothschild’sKuhn, Loeb, and Co. The assistant secretary of the Navy at this time was oneFranklin Delano Roosevelt, who was awarding big navy contracts well before therewas any talk of America joining the war – just as he would a few years later,when he was president before and during the Second World War.Another confirmation that the First World War was engineered for longer termreasons came in the 1950s, with the findings of a US Congressional investigationby the Reece Committee into the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Itwas found to be an organisation dedicated to creating war! This organisation isone of a network of so-called tax-exempt foundations started by the Carnegie,Rockefeller, and Ford families, which help to fund the New World Order plan.Norman Dodd, the Reece Committee’s Director of Research, reported the findingsof his investigator Kathryn Casey: Dodd said that at one meeting of the Carnegietrustees, the question was asked: “Is there any means known to man moreeffective than war if you want to alter the lives of an entire people?” It wasdecided that there was not, and so the next question for the trustees was, “Howdo we involve the United States in a war?” Dodd went on:> “And then they raised the question: ‘How do we control the diplomatic> machinery of the United States?’ And the answer came out: ‘We must control the> State Department’. At this point we catch up with what we had already found> out…that through an agency set up by the Carnegie Endowment, every high> appointment in the State Department was cleared. Finally, we were in a war.> These trustees in a meeting about 1917 had the brashness to congratulate> themselves on the wisdom of their original decision because already the impact> of the war had indicated it would alter life and can alter life in this> country. This was the date of our entry in the war; we were involved. They> even had the brashness to word and to dispatch a telegram to Mr Wilson,> cautioning him to see that the war did not end too quickly.” 12 [my emphasis]Dodd said that Kathryn Casey then found other minutes, dealing with the work ofthe Carnegie Endowment to prevent American life returning to its pre-war state.Changing the way people lived and thought was, after all, the main point of thewar. Dodd reported that:> “…they came to the conclusion that, to prevent a reversion, they must control> education. And then they approached the Rockefeller Foundation and they said:> ‘Will you take on the acquisition of control of education as it involves> subjects that are domestic in their significance’. And it was agreed. Then> together, they decided that the key to it was the teaching of American history> and they must change that. So, they then approached the most prominent of what> we might call American historians at that time with the idea of getting them> to alter the manner in which they presented the subject.”13This is why most of the information in this book about the real background toworld events has never been taught in the schools or universities. If you arenot being allowed to know the full story about something, it is because (fromthe manipulators’ point of view) it is dangerous for you to know. That is mymotivation in writing this book. You have a right to be dangerous!The Russian RevolutionWith the First World War underway, another Elite coup was reaching fruition, theRussian Revolution of 1917. This took the same form as the French Revolution.The Elite created economic chaos and the ruling dictator, the Tsar, played intotheir hands by refusing to introduce democracy and empowerment for the people.In 1905, the Tsar was manipulated by the Rothschilds into a war with Japan toundermine the Russian economy and sow the seeds of unrest among the population.The Rothschilds told the Tsar that they would finance the war, while in theUnited States, the Rothschild company, Kuhn, Loeb, and Co, was secretly fundingthe Japanese. Then the war with Germany came in 1914, during which the RussianArmy was constantly weakened by outside influences. One way the Elite havecontrolled wars is to send inferior weapons to the side they want to lose or todelay the delivery of armaments altogether. In 1915, the British Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and soon-to-be Prime Minister, Lloyd George (Comm 300), realisedthat armaments ordered for the Russian Army were five months overdue. At onepoint there was only one rifle for every six soldiers. This fuelled the fires ofrevolution, exactly as planned. The Elite wanted to demoralise the Russiansoldiers so they would mutiny. The company responsible for the delay was VickersMaxim, which was controlled by Sir Ernest Cassel, a business associate of theRothschilds’ Kuhn, Loeb, and Company. The largest holder of Vickers stock wasthe House of Rothschild.14 The British Cabinet dispatched Lord Kitchener toRussia to reorganise their army, but he was drowned on the way when the HMSHampshire ‘mysteriously’ sank on the night of June 5th 1916. Just anothercoincidence, I guess.In Russia, dissension was being stirred. The first (and more moderate)revolution was begun by a Freemason, Alexander Kerensky. I say ‘first’, in factthere was another revolution even before this, headed by Prince Lvov. He plannedto create an American-style Republic and by this time Tsar Nicholas II hadalready abdicated. But, as in France when the momentum for revolution had beentriggered, along came the next, more terrifying stage. Trotsky and Lenin arrivedto take over and introduce the despotic rule known as Marxism-Leninism. This wasnot a Russian Revolution. It was a coup on Russia by the United States financialarm of the Global Elite largely controlled by the Rothschilds. Leon Trotsky, whohad been living in New York after being expelled from Germany, left forPetrograd, Russia, on the SS Kristianiafjord on March 26th 1917, with $10,000given to him by the Rockefellers.15 In his hand was a United States passportarranged for him by President Woodrow Wilson. Jennings C. Wise says in hisstudy, Woodrow Wilson: Disciple Of Revolution: “Historians must never forgetthat Woodrow Wilson, despite the efforts of the British police, made it possiblefor Leon Trotsky to enter Russia with an American passport”.16 This happened ata time when the US authorities were supposed to be tightening their checks onpotential revolutionaries entering Russia on United States passports! But whocontrolled Wilson? The Elite’s representative, Colonel Edward House (Comm 300).When the ship docked in Canada en route, Trotsky was detained by the Canadianauthorities, but he was released and allowed to continue his journey to Russia.Lieutenant Colonel John Bayne MacLean, the founder and President of MacleanPublishing, was known for his close contacts with Canadian Intelligence. In1918, he wrote an article which appeared in his own MacLean’s magazine, headed“Why Did We Let Trotsky Go? How Canada Lost The Chance To Shorten The War”.17MacLean made a number of revelations about Trotsky, many of which have beenconfirmed or supported by evidence that has come to light since then. He saidthat Trotsky was not Russian, but German, and other intelligence information hassuggested that he spoke better German than Russian.18 MacLean’s sources saidTrotsky had been very publicly ‘expelled’ from Germany in August 1914 to givehim credibility for what was to follow. MacLean said that other Russianrevolutionaries organised by Trotsky in the United States and Western Canadawere “largely Germans and Austrians travelling as Russians”. MacLean went on:> “Originally the British found through Russian associates that Kerensky, Lenin,> and some lesser leaders were practically in German pay as early as 1915 and> they uncovered in 1916 the connections with Trotsky, then living in New York.> From that time he was closely watched by the Bomb Squad. In the early part of> 1916, a German official sailed into New York. British Intelligence officials> accompanied him. He [Trotsky] was held up at Halifax, but on their [British> Intelligence] instruction, he was passed on with profuse apologies for the> unnecessary delay. After much manoeuvring, he arrived in a dirty little> newspaper office in the slums and there he found Trotsky, for whom he bore> important instructions. From June 1916, until they passed him onto the> British, the New York Bomb Squad never lost touch with Trotsky. They> discovered that his real name was Braunstein19 and that he was German, not a> Russian.”Interestingly, if this is correct, both communism and fascism (which came intoconflict in the Second World War) were created to a large extent in the samecountry – Germany, the home of so many Elite secret societies and birthplace ofAdam Weishaupt’s Bavarian Illuminati. After Trotsky arrived in Russia, he wasjoined by Lenin, who had been given safe passage across Germany in a sealedtrain, from Switzerland to Russia via Sweden, in April 1917, accompanied bythirty-two other ‘revolutionaries’. The trip was approved and paid for by theGerman General Staff under orders from German Supreme Command. The Germans werealso spending big sums to fund the Bolshevik’s propaganda inside Russia. VonKuhmann, the Foreign Affairs Minister, told the Kaiser in 1917:> “It was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of funds> through the various channels and under varying labels that they were in a> position to be able to build up their organ, Pravda, to conduct energetic> propaganda and appreciably to extend the originally narrow base of their> party.”20The plan was that the re-revolution would withdraw Russia from the First WorldWar and make ‘peace’ with Germany. This is precisely what happened. Once more,these events are multidimensional. The Russian ‘revolutionaries’ such as Leninand Trotsky were being used to get Russia out of the war, to the benefit ofGermany. But at the Elite level, the bogeyman called communism was being createdto stimulate the division of fear and mistrust presented as communism vcapitalism v fascism. Once you have fear caused by two or more distinct ‘sides’,you have divide and rule: control. Fear is also the greatest producer ofnegative energy. While Trotsky, Lenin, and their crowd were denouncing thecapitalists, they were being financed by the London and New York bankers.Trotsky was quoted in the Russian newspaper, Russkoe, as saying that the “Sovietcannot align itself…with capitalist Americans, for this would be a betrayal”. Ohreally, Leon? In fact, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were supported financially andpolitically by the same people who would support Hitler and the fascists becausethe Elite has no political line. In his autobiography, Trotsky refers to some ofthe loans from British financiers. Many of these were arranged by Lord Milner(Comm 300) of the Round Table and ‘Alexander’ Gruzenberg (real name Michael),the chief Bolshevik agent in Scandinavia, who was a confidential advisor to theJ.P. Morgan-owned Chase National Bank in New York. This was a London-New Yorkrevolution, with the Russian people once again the victims.A Mr Fixit between London, Wall Street, and the Bolsheviks was Olof Aschberg,who became known as the Bolshevik Banker. He owned Nya Banken, founded inStockholm in 1912. Aschberg’s London agent was the North Commerce Bank, chairedby Earl Grey, a friend of Cecil Rhodes and a member of the Round Table. Anotherclose associate of Aschberg was Max May, the vice president of J.P. Morgan’sGuaranty Trust and head of its overseas operations. Clearly Aschberg was theperfect middle man to channel funds from London and New York to the Bolsheviks.In 1915, the American International Corporation was formed to fund the RussianRevolution. Its directors represented the interests of the Rockellers,Rothschilds, DuPont, Kuhn, Loeb, Harriman, and the Federal Reserve. Theyincluded Frank Vanderlip (one of the Jekyl Island Group which created theFederal Reserve) and George Herbert Walker, the grandfather of President GeorgeBush.The Rothschilds were also directly involved in financing the revolution viaJacob Schiff, at Kuhn, Loeb, and Co in New York. International bankers fromBritain, the United States, Russia, Germany, and France met in Sweden in thesummer of 1917. They agreed that Kuhn, Loeb would deposit $50 million in aSwedish bank account for Lenin and Trotsky’s use. In an article in The New YorkAmerican Journal on February 3rd 1949, Jacob Schiff’s grandson said that hisgrandfather had paid the two ‘revolutionaries’ an additional $20 million. Thepayment of $20 million to the Bolsheviks by Elihu Root (the Kuhn Loeb lawyer andformer Secretary of State), via a Special War Fund, is recorded in theCongressional Record of September 2nd 1919. It was quite an investment if, assome researchers suggest, Lenin repaid Kuhn, Loeb, and Co the rouble equivalentof $450 million between 1918 and 1922. And this was nothing compared with theprofits the bankers made from the exploitation of the Russian land, economy, andpeople, not least by stealing the Tsar’s gold and vast financial holdings whichwere held abroad in the very banks that funded the revolution.In 1917, the Elite used the cover of a Red Cross mission to Russia to arrangethe final details of the Bolshevik takeover. The Red Cross in Washingtonlaunched a campaign to raise $2 million. It was successful thanks only tosubstantial donations from New York financiers, including J.P. Morgan himself,who gave $100,000. The bankers and industrialists proceeded to take control ofthe United States Red Cross and, as the Elite’s John Foster Dulles put it, they“viewed the American Red Cross as a virtual arm of government…”.21 The personnelof this mission to Russia in August 1917 says it all. Only seven of the party oftwenty-four were doctors. The rest were mostly New York financiers and theirassistants, led by William Boyce Thompson (Comm 300), the first full-time headof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The doctors returned after only onemonth and Dr Frank Billings, Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicagoand the official leader of the mission, was reported to have been disgusted withthe obviously political activities of its non-medical members. Also in the partywere three Russian interpreters, all known Bolsheviks. One of them, BorisReinstein, would become secretary to Lenin and head of the Bureau ofInternational Revolutionary Propaganda.22 The Red Cross has been used on manyoccasions by the Elite without the knowledge of its genuine staff. This is notonly an insult to the work the Red Cross is seeking to do, it is also extremelydangerous for the 99% who are genuinely working for that organisation out ofcompassion for the plight of the world’s peoples. Intriguingly, the Red Crosssymbol is also that of the Knights Templar, the flag of England, and the symbolwhich Columbus flew on his ships while ‘discovering’ the ‘New World’ on behalfof the Templars. The Red Cross was formed during the Elite-engineeredFranco-Prussian War in 1870 via correspondence in our old friend, the LondonTimes.At the same time that these elite bankers were creating organisations to supportthe Bolsheviks, they were also funding and setting up anti-Bolshevikorganisations. Otto Kahn and members of the Morgan Guaranty Trust formed a groupcalled United Americans, which circulated anti-communist and anti-Jewishpropaganda. This allowed genuine opponents of the revolution to be dismissed as‘anti-Semitic’. This has continued to happen up to the present day, with theRobot Radicals of the “I’m full of my own political purity” mindset dancing onthe strings pulled by the Global Elite to denounce anyone who gets close to thetruth as an ‘anti-Semite’. The same is happening to me today. It’s all sopredictable. The Robot Radicals and their ‘opposition’, the Robot Right, havetheir strings pulled by the same people! It’s hilarious, really.On his way back from Russia, William Boyce Thompson stopped over in London tomeet the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George. They were joined by Thomas W.Lamont of J.P. Morgan, who had travelled from Paris (where he had been indiscussion with Colonel Edward House on how to rearrange the world after thewar). House had cabled President Wilson on November 28th 1917, urging him tosuppress all media criticism of the Bolsheviks: “It is exceedingly importantthat such criticism be suppressed”, the cable said. This telegram was placed ina confidential file and came to light only six years later. Researcher, CarrollQuigley, said that the House of Morgan was infiltrating Left-wing groups in theUnited States from around 1915. It was the strategy to hijack both ‘Left’ and‘Right’ domestically and internationally.23The Russian Revolution was all part of the Big Plan, which is why the leadingofficials of the Rothschild-controlled Federal Reserve Bank of New York,including Thompson, supported the Bolsheviks. In this period, we are seeing theGlobal Elite deciding on the post-war policies and ensuring that thepuppet-politicians make it happen. Thompson and Lamont met Lloyd George toconvince him that the British government’s anti-Bolshevik stance was misguidedand should encompass the reality that Lenin and Trotsky were there to stay.24Lloyd George and his Cabinet – including the Round Table’s Lord Milner, ofcourse – accepted the Thompson-Lamont view. When you have agents of the Elite invital positions on all sides in this way, you can pretty much do what you like.The British decision to back the Bolsheviks is less surprising when you considerthat Lloyd George was not a free agent in this. His private life left him opento blackmail and he was under obligations to an international armaments dealercalled Basil Zaharoff (who made a fortune selling arms to both sides in any warhe could find). Zaharoff had a hold over Lloyd George after he arranged for thePrime Minister to have an affair with his wife, formerly Emily Ann Burrows ofKnightsbridge. Zaharoff also sold peerages created by Lloyd George.25 In the1963 book, The Mask Of Merlin,26 the writer Donald McCormick says that Zaharoffhad so much power that “Allied statesmen and leaders were obliged to consult himbefore planning any great attack”. Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George, and the FrenchPrime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, met a number of times at Zaharoff’s Parishome. This is relevant to the Allied policy on Russia because Zaharoff wassupporting the Bolsheviks and diverting arms away from those opposing them. He,too, intervened on the Bolsheviks’ behalf in both London and Paris.In April 1919, the British Foreign Office issued a nine pence White Paper onRussia which revealed that the revolution had been organised and financed byinternational bankers. It explained how “Chinese criminals” had been imported toserve under Bolshevik officers in a terror campaign against the people ofRussia. This document was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a six penceversion – minus this information.27 Some claim that the Bolshevik Revolution wasa Jewish Revolution, but I think that Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman reads thesituation perfectly when he writes:> “The truth of the matter was…that there was a conspiracy, but it was neither> Jewish, nor Catholic, nor Masonic. It involved people of all types of> religions and national backgrounds. Side by side with the Schiffs, Warburgs,> and Rothschilds were the Morgans and the Rockefellers. With Trotsky were Lenin> and Stalin.”28What was the common theme between them? The cult of the All-Seeing Eye. With therevolution established, the Elite arranged for its intelligence personnel to besent to Russia. Alfred Milner selected an agent, Bruce Lockhart (Comm 300), togo to Russia and to team up with the American, Raymond Robins, who had been leftbehind by William Boyce Thompson to lead the – now doctorless – ‘Red Cross’mission through 1918. The French chose to send the Bolshevik supporter, JacquesSadoul, an old friend of Trotsky. The conspiracy then had control of thediplomatic and intelligence reports coming out of Russia to their governments.With that, the coup by the Global Elite on the Russian people was complete.Lenin and Trotsky proceeded to dismantle any institutions and groups of workerswhich had emerged from the early days of the revolution. The hated Okhrana, the‘secret service’ of the Tsars, was revamped into what eventually became the KGB.The ‘People’s Revolution’, which would turn hundreds of millions of people intolittle more than prisoners in their own land and cause the death and sufferingof so many in the concentration camps, had massively advanced the aims of theNew World Order. The Soviet card would be played with great effect in thedecades that followed.The Creation of the State of IsraelAnother Elite ambition during the First World War was to ensure the recognitionby Britain of a Jewish homeland in what was then Arab Palestine. The politicalmovement known as Zionism had been introduced to campaign for a Jewish homeland,but it is often misunderstood: all Jewish people are not Zionists and allZionists are not Jewish. Zionism is not a religion or a race; it is a politicalmovement consisting of people, Jews and non-Jews, who support the claim for aJewish homeland. If you support that, you are a Zionist, too, no matter whatyour race or religious belief. To say that Zionism is the Jewish race is likesaying the British Labour Party is the English race. Zionism was founded in thelast century by an atheist, Theodore Herzl, and it is used as a front for theGlobal Elite and a means to dupe Jewish people as a whole. The offer torecognise a homeland in Palestine was designed both to persuade the UnitedStates to enter the war and later to create ‘managed conflict’ and a situationof ‘divide and rule’ in the oil-rich Middle East. More than twenty years afterthe First World War, on April 25th 1939, US Senator Gerald P. Nye of NorthDakota revealed to the Senate some of the background to Britain’s recognition ofa Jewish homeland and the First World War in general. He said he had been givensome documents called ‘The Next War’. The title referred to the Second WorldWar, which the writers of the documents already knew was going to happen. Onevolume, called ‘Propaganda in the Next War’, also discussed, in passing, how theAmerican people had been tricked into fighting in World War I. It said:> “For some time the issue as to which side the United States would take hung in> the balance, the final result was a credit to our British propaganda. There> remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world Jewish population of> approximately fifteen million, no fewer than five million are in the United> States; 25% of the inhabitants of New York are Jews.> “During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewish public by the> promise of the Jewish national home in Palestine, held by Ludendorf to be a> master stroke of allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to> Jews in America, but to Jews in Germany as well.”29The Americans entered the war in 1917. The Balfour Declaration came on November6th of that year, when Arthur (Lord) Balfour (Comm 300), the British ForeignSecretary and member of the Round Table’s inner elite, officially recognisedPalestine as a homeland for Jewish people. We need to look at this on manylevels again. The propagandists may well have believed it was a ‘master stroke’to bring America into the war, but what they didn’t know was that they werebeing manipulated to manipulate others. America was coming into the war anyway.A Jewish homeland in Palestine had been a long-time Elite strategy and the guiseof bringing America into the war was used to encourage British politicians toaccept it. The Balfour Declaration was a terrible blow to the Arabs who had,under the leadership and promises of the Englishman, T.E. Lawrence (‘Lawrence ofArabia’), fought on Britain’s behalf against the Turks and they played a crucialrole in winning the war. The Arabs were promised full post-war sovereignty andindependence for their support and this was confirmed in officialcorrespondence. Lawrence, a close friend of Winston Churchill (Comm 300), knewfull well that he was lying to the Arabs he was leading. Some years laterLawrence said:> “I risked the fraud on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap> and speedy victory in the East, and that better we win and break our word,> than lose…The Arab inspiration was our main tool for winning the Eastern War.> So I assured them that England kept her word in letter and in spirit. In this> comfort they performed their fine things; but, of course, instead of being> proud of what we did together, I was continually bitter and ashamed.” 30While Lawrence and the British were promising the Arabs independence, they werein the process of making a commitment to give away Palestine as a Jewishhomeland. Lawrence, Milner, and Victor Rothschild all knew each other. TheBalfour Declaration was not an announcement by the Foreign Secretary to theHouse of Commons. It took the form, appropriately, of a letter between ArthurBalfour (Comm 300), of the Rothschild-funded Round Table, and Lord Lionel WalterRothschild (Comm 300), the representative of the English Federation of Zionists,which was set up with Rothschild money. It was written by the leading voice inLloyd George’s wartime cabinet, the Round Table’s most influential figure, LordMilner (who was made chairman of Rio Tinto Zinc by Lord Rothschild).31 TheBalfour Declaration was a decree by the Rothschilds/Global Elite and not part ofany democratic process. Balfour’s letter to Lord Rothschild, believed by many tohave been written by Lord Rothschild, in league with Alfred Milner, said:> “I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty’s> Government, the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist> aspirations which has been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet: His> Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a> national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours for> the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall> be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing> non-Jewish communities in Palestine [what a joke!], or the rights and> political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. I should be grateful if> you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.”At the time less than one per cent of the population of Palestine was Jewish andyet this letter was to form the basis on which the post-war world was to bedivided and Arab control of Palestine handed over. It had nothing to do withwhat was best for Jews, even though its architects, the Rothschilds, are Jewishif only in name. It was about the wider strategic oil and New World Orderpossibilities that a foothold in that part of the Middle East would offer. Ibelieve that Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman is correct when he links the House ofRothschild with the All-Seeing Eye clique which is seeking to destroy Judaism.Things may be done in the name of Jewish people as a whole, but they are notdone for their benefit. Jewish people are used as fodder by the Elite and bymany within the Jewish hierarchy. Nor is it true that most Jewish people todayhave a genetic line back to ancient Israel, a claim used to justify theoccupation of Palestine. For the same reason, the term ‘anti-Semitic’ isconstantly misused.Personally, I don’t care about the colour and genetic line of a person’sphysical body. It is a vehicle for experience, that’s all. We are aspects ofeach other. But since many people use the genetics of their bodies to justifytheir actions, we might as well get the information right. The word Semiticcomes from the race of peoples in ancient Sumer from whom the biblical Jewsclaimed to have emerged. Sem or Shem, one of the sons of Noah in the Biblestories, is said to be of this line and the origin appears to have been thelegend of ‘Shemjaza’, the ‘heavenly son and guardian angel of God’. Anotherextraterrestrial almost certainly. But according to several Jewish writers,including Arthur Koestler in his book, The Thirteenth Tribe,32 very few Jewstoday can trace their genetic ancestry back to the Semite line of this periodand/or the Semitic line in Palestine and Israel at the time of Y’shua (Jesus).Instead, they are the genetic descendants of a people ofTurkish-Mongolian-Nordic ancestry called the Khazars who converted to the Jewishreligion in 740AD.The Khazars lived in lower Russia between the Black and Caspian Seas. They werebetween the Christian and Islamic worlds and their leader chose to accept theJewish faith to avoid being swamped by the empires of the perceivedalternatives. Most Jews today, Koestler says, originate from these people, notthe Semitic line. In fact, to call someone ‘anti-Semitic’ is, more accurately,to call them ‘anti-Arab’, because more members of the old Semite race are Arabthan are Jewish!After the breakup of the Khazar empire by the thirteenth century, the people whoadopted the Jewish faith either stayed on in Russia or, in the case of themajority, moved on into what became the Balkans, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany.The language known as Yiddish emerged from these events. It is a mixture ofHebrew, Polish, and German. The name Rothschild came from the Red Shield, thesymbol of the Khazar “Jews” in eastern Europe (German: rotes schild = redshield). The Rothschild family have no more an historic link to Palestine thanan eskimo.33 The ‘Jewish’ hooked nose does not originate from the biblicalIsrael. It has its genetic origins in the Caucasus. The classic Jewish face ofY’shua (Jesus) is a myth. He would not have looked anything like that because hewas not born in Lower Russia. As Koestler wrote, “Anthropology concurs withhistory in refuting the popular belief in a Jewish race descended from thebiblical tribe”. The Jewish-born Christian bishop, Hugh Montefiore, said in theChurch Times of January 24th 1992, that: “Anti-Semitism is built on a powerfulracial myth, accepted by Jews and anti-Semites alike”. Yet it is members of thegenetic stream which has no connection whatsoever with Palestine, who werebehind the creation of Israel and today’s continued suppression of Palestinianrights.The Jewish writer Alfred M. Lilienthal goes further. He says there is no suchthing as a Jewish “race”. To be “Jewish” is to follow the Jewish religious faithand has nothing to do with race because, he says, people of endless racesconverted to the Jewish faith over thousands of years, so creating a vastcocktail of different genetic streams who called themselves Jewish. In hiscourageous book, What Price Israel?, Lilienthal points out:> “The most persuasive argument the Jewish nationalist could advance for Zionism> is based on the hypothesis of a ‘Hebrew-Semitic race’. But most members of> such a ‘race’ would be found amongst the Arabic peoples of the Middle East,> the overwhelming majority of whom do not profess the Jewish faith. The Arabs,> bitter enemies of the Israelis who have returned to their reported ‘racial> home’, most closely resemble those Jews who are indigenous to Palestine and> the Middle East; for they are of poorer Hebrew-Israelite blood than most of> those who have been ‘ingathered’…The allegation that Arabs are anti-Semitic is> somewhat ludicrous.> “…it is, in fact, the unanimous conclusion of all anthropologists, from> Weissenberg, Hertz and Fishberg (themselves Jews), to Boas, Ripley, Mead,> Pittard and others that wherever Jews are found, they closely resemble the> people amongst whom they live. Even those of common family names supposedly> traceable to the ancient Hebrew tribes, such as Levites (Levi) and Kohanim> (Kohn, Coehn, Cohn) have little physical resemblence to one another. There is> not one racial characteristic common to all who profess to be Jews.” 34Such subtleties evaded Lloyd George (Comm 300), who was a passionate advocate ofa Jewish homeland in Israel. When you look at what he wrote on the subject inthe 1920s, either he was trying to mislead the populace or he himself was beingseriously misled. In his book, Is It Peace?, he accepts without question thatJewish people had an historical right to Palestine.35 He says that only withtheir brilliance and commitment could it become a ‘land of milk and honey’ againbecause, basically – if you put his words in simple terms – the Arabs were toostupid to do that. But it is when he outlines Zionist intentions for Palestinethat his claims can be shown to be breathtakingly naïve or calculated tomislead. Even more likely, the endless means through which he could have beenblackmailed over his private life and personal corruption acted to ‘focus’ hismind. As they say, “When you have got someone by the balls, their hearts andminds will follow”. Lloyd George condemns the opponents of the BalfourDeclaration for suggesting that the Zionist leaders were seeking to establish “aJewish oligarchy in Palestine that will reduce the Arab inhabitant to acondition of servitude to a favoured Hebrew minority”.36 The best answer to thatcharge, he said, was to be found in a memorandum submitted by the ZionistAssociation to the League of Nations. With the hindsight of more than seventyyears, I doubt if even Lloyd George would now quote that memorandum asconfirmation that the opponents were wrong. It said:> “The Jews demand no privilege, unless it is the privilege of rebuilding by> their own efforts and sacrifices a land which, once the seat of a thriving and> productive civilisation, has long been suffered to remain derelict. They> expect no favoured treatment in the matter of political or religious rights.> They assume, as a matter of course, that all the inhabitants of Palestine, be> they Jews or non-Jews, will be in every respect on a footing of perfect> equality. They seek no share in the Government beyond that to which they may> be entitled under the Constitution as citizens of the country. They solicit no> favours. They ask, in short, no more than an assured opportunity of peacefully> building up their National Home by their own exertions and of succeeding on> their merits.”The Jewish and Arab populations of Israel will be in every respect on a footingof perfect equality? They expect no favoured treatment in the matter ofpolitical or religious rights? Really?Chaim Herzog, the President of Israel, had a rather different view some yearslater, when he said that the Arabs cannot be “participants in any way in a landthat has been consecrated to our people for thousands of years. To the Jews ofthis land there cannot be any partner”.37 There, that’s more like it! Jewishpeople as a whole (the faith) have been victims of Zionism (the politicalmovement), which is controlled by the Global Elite. It is time Jewish people(who are innocent and unaware of the background) realised how they, their mindsand their emotions are being used in ways that serve a longer-term plan forcentralised control, and not themselves and their children.This is certainly true of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith which wasformed in the United States in 1913. From that time to this, the Anti-DefamationLeague (ADL) has operated as an intelligence unit which brands as “anti-Semitic”anyone who challenges or questions the Global Elite. But was it set up for thebenefit of Jewish people? No, no. It was formed to protect the New Yorkgangsters! In the early years of this century, Thomas Bingham, the New York CityPolice Commissioner, began a determined challenge to the mobsters. Among themwas Arnold Rothstein, the mentor of Meyer Lansky who would later be thegodfather of the organised crime syndicate which helped to fund and arm theJewish terrorist underground in Palestine and later did the same for the Stateof Israel itself. Lansky was also a key player in the assassination of PresidentKennedy. The New York mobsters responded to Bingham’s investigation by brandinghim an anti-Semite. This character demolition was so successful that it forcedhim out of office and ended the investigation of the mob.These attacks were coordinated by a committee set up by an attorney calledSigmund Livingston. In 1913 this committee was given a formal title – TheAnti-Defamation League.38 Today it is an arm of the Israeli/Global Eliteintelligence agency, Mossad, and has been at the heart of some horrific events,including the Kennedy assassination. The ADL is there to help the Global Eliteand the terrorists who have controlled Israel, not to protect Jewish people fromprejudice. Anything but, in fact.Winning the PeaceThe First World War ended in 1918 with tens of millions of dead and injured onall sides, after the bloodiest conflict in known human history. It was a warthat was planned and created by the Elite using the power and money of thebanking and secret society network. It would not otherwise have happened. It wasnot the work of human nature, but manipulated human nature. At the same time,the Elite had sown the seeds for the capitalist/communist v fascist (Second)World War and the capitalism v communism Cold War by arranging and financing theRussian Revolution. The Elite had won the revolution and the war. Now theyprepared for their most important ambition – winning the peace. They had thenation states of Europe exactly where they wanted them. The war had left Europedevastated and submerged in debt to the Elite’s bankers, who had made loans toboth sides. The name J.P. Morgan (Comm 300) was at the heart of this. The MorganGuaranty Trust and the Elite’s American International Corporation made loans tofinance German espionage and covert operations in the United States and SouthAmerica during the war. This was revealed by the Overman Committee of the USSenate in 1919. Among the other names involved were the Rothschilds’ Kuhn, Loeb,and Co, and Morgan’s Chase National Bank. The committee also established thatthe Guaranty Trust which was making loans to the Allies during the war, wascovertly arranging other loans for Germany on the London money markets! Thismoney was channelled to Germany via South America.39In 1915 while all this was happening, the same J.P. Morgan was named by theBritish government as its sole agent for the purchasing of Britain’s warsupplies from the then ‘neutral’ United States, and for all loans from privatebanks in the US. Britain also became the guarantor for all goods and loans fromAmerica by the French, Italians, and Russians. By the end of the war, Britain,once the most powerful country in the world, was on its knees. Again, this wasnot accident, but design. At the time of the Versailles Peace Conference in1919, Britain owed the United States $4.7 billion in war debts. The Britishnational debt had increased by 924% between 1913 and 1918, while the profits ofthe Global Elite companies soared. According to the Austrian writer, GertrudeElias, the capital of DuPont (Comm 300) alone increased from $83 million to $308million during the years of the First World War.40 The ‘victorious’ leaders ofthe Allies at Versailles were Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George, and GeorgesClemenceau. They met with their ‘advisors’ to decide the reparations thatGermany would pay to the victors and the terms of the peace settlement.Versailles and its offshoots would also give birth to the League of Nations, theElite’s first attempt at a covert world government, and the World Court in TheHague, Netherlands. It would further confirm Israel as a Jewish homeland, givingcontrol of Palestine to the British in the meantime, and return the worldeconomy to the gold standard, the process by which currencies are linked togold. Who controlled the gold? The Rothschilds and some other Elite financiers.The Elite also controlled the events and decisions at Versailles. Woodrow Wilsonwas ‘advised’ there by Colonel House (Comm 300) and Bernard Baruch, bothRothschild-Elite representatives; Lloyd George (Comm 300) was advised by LordMilner (Comm 300) of the Round Table and Sir Phillip Sassoon, a directdescendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild; Clemenceau had Georges Mandel, hisMinister for the Interior, whose real name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Also in theAmerican Commission to Negotiate Peace were the Dulles brothers; the Warburgs(Max from Germany and Paul from the US); Thomas W. Lamont from J.P. Morgan; theSecretary of State, Robert Lansing, an uncle of the Dulles’s; and Walter Lippman(Comm 300) who (with House and others) was one of the main architects of theLeague of Nations and founder of the American branch of the Fabian Society.Their host in France was Baron Edmund de Rothschild, a leading campaigner andmanipulator for a Jewish State in Israel.The three leaders (stooges) at Versailles set up two committees to work on thedetails of the post-war policies. One was called the Economic Section and theother was the Financial Committee. Woodrow Wilson appointed Bernard Baruch torepresent the US on the Economic Section and Thomas W. Lamont of J.P. Morganarticulated US (Elite) interests on the Financial Committee. Baruch’s groupdecided that Germany should pay $12 billion in reparations and, together withother limitations on the German economy, this was a death sentence for the newGerman Republic, known as the Weimar Republic. It would ensure the conditionsthat would lead to Adolf Hitler’s rise to power. The Financial Committee metlater in Brussels to decide on a return to the gold standard. The effect of thison currencies made it impossible for Germany to pay her reparations. Thefinancial consequences of a return to the gold standard for every nation werepointed out to the committee by Professor Gustav Cassel of Sweden, but to noavail. All these decisions were coordinated to create the circumstances inEurope which would lead to the next war and an advancement of the New WorldOrder. Eventually the gold standard caused such chaos and suffering that it hadto be abandoned, but by then the damage was done.Colonel House wrote the first draft of what became the covenant of the newLeague of Nations and President Wilson’s famous fourteen points for theVersailles Conference were largely decided by a group convened by Colonel House.This group was known as ‘The Inquiry’. These were all New World Ordermanipulators, people like John Foster Dulles, the future US secretary of state,and his brother, Allen, future head of the CIA. House had written a novel yearsbefore called Philip Dru: Administrator, which he later admitted was factpresented as fiction. In the book he outlined his New World Order philosophy.41President Wilson’s biographer, George Sylvester Viereck, said that: “The WilsonAdministration transferred the Colonel’s ideas from the pages of fiction to thepages of history”.42 In his novel, published anonymously two years before theFirst World War had even begun, he proposed “…a League of Nations”. Seven yearslater, that very same name was used for an organisation designed to impose itswill on nation states under the pretext of ending the wars which its architectshad started! Create the problems, then offer the solutions. The Rockefellersdonated the money to build the headquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva,Switzerland, and they would later donate the land which the United Nationsheadquarters now occupies in New York.The League of Nations failed, despite the best efforts of the One Worlders,because they could not persuade quite enough representatives in the US Congressto support it. If the United States would not support the idea, it was doomed tofail. It could be that the Second World War had been planned to increase thepower of the League of Nations and turn it into a fully fledged worldgovernment. This setback meant, instead, that the Elite had to use the next warto introduce the successor to the League. Even as the League of Nations folded,the United Nations of today was already in their sights.> SOURCES> > > 1 Rabbi Marvin S.

The sceneof this tussle is the collective human mind.In these last years of the twentieth century and across into the millennium, thehuman race is being given an opportunity we’ve not had since Atlantis, to stepout of the prison and into mental, emotional, and spiritual freedom. Events arehappening, which I will describe in detail later, that are dissolving theimprisoning vibration and vibrationally reconnecting the Earth with the rest ofCreation. We and our ‘father’ will be One again. It won’t simply ‘happen’ forevery individual; the desire to do this needs to be present. But the opportunityis there for all and many are grasping that opportunity, as I know from thethousands of letters I receive and the people I meet. We are in a period oftransition from the old fear vibration to the re-emerging love vibration.We know this at a subconscious level and, for rapidly increasing numbers, at aconscious level too. Most people at this time can’t remember why they are here,but they will. The Prison Warders on the Fourth Dimension know what is happeningtoo, and the last thing that consciousness wants is for its prison andnegative-energy-production-unit to be no more. The key to breaking out of thisspiritual prison is the awakening and expansion of our consciousness to thepoint where its vibratory rate will be so high and powerful that it can,collectively, dismantle the blocking frequency. The Prison Warders, via theGlobal Elite, have been doing everything possible to close our minds and todivide us so that we do not work together as One. As I describe the quickeningpace of the global manipulation after the First World War, this reflects thepressure coming from the Prison Warder consciousness for a speeding up of thework towards centralised control of the human mind before the challenge to thisplanetary occupation reaches its peak, in the latter years of this decade andinto the next millennium. This speeding up of the centralised control is yetagain a reflection of the collective human mind. It has become a downwardspiral. As we have given our minds away and taken on thought patterns fromothers about our lack of self-worth and potential to control our own lives, wehave created that physical reality. But instead of learning the lesson in thelight of events this has caused, such as wars, we have allowed those events tofurther demoralise us, frighten us, and fill us with guilt and despair. This hasfurther diminished our self-worth, thus increasing our self-loathing and ourdesperation to look to others for the answers to the gathering gloom. Thecollective mind has then manifested that negative sense of reality in anescalation to even more centralised power and control which, at a subconsciouslevel, the human mind is demanding out of its fear and self-loathing. The PrisonWarders have taken advantage of this and fuelled the fires of the collectivemindset. But they can’t create the reality; only we can. And we can only do thatby the way we think about ourselves and the way we allow ourselves to absorb thethought patterns of others, including the Prison Warders and the Global Elite,who are working to erode our sense of self-love and self-worth.With every year of the twentieth century, the quickening pace of the New WorldOrder agenda can be identified. A network of organisations developed rapidlyafter the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919, and today this network is themost influential of all the Global Elite structures in controlling world events.The organisations within this network are presented as harmless ‘think tanks’and forums, but they are, in truth, part of a global web of deception andmanipulation. They were introduced to infiltrate all areas of politics, banking,business, the media, education, science, and the military. Their role is torecruit members who support the New World Order philosophy and ensure that theyare appointed to positions of power and influence in all these areas of nationaland international life. They are organisations within organisations, eating awayat the established structure and directing the world along the road to a globaltyranny. All are offshoots of the original Round Table which began to give birthto this network after Versailles, with the creation of the Institute ofInternational Affairs, based at Chatham House in London. It became the ‘Royal’Institute when the sitting monarch became its official head in 1926. It wasfounded by members of the British and American delegations at Versailles whenthey gathered at the Hotel Majestic in Paris on May 30th 1919. The two groupswere composed of members of Lord Milner’s Round Table from Britain and ColonelHouse’s ‘Inquiry’ group from the United States. Quite simply, they werededicated to the creation of the New World Order.The Round Table had close links with the Rothschild, Morgan, Rockefeller, andCarnegie Empires, and these connections were extended to the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs (RIIA). In Britain, the Astors, including Major John(Jacob) Astor (Comm 300), a director of Hambros Bank and owner of The Timesnewspaper (after 1922) were operating at the heart of both the Round Table andthe Institute, and many of the former associates of Cecil Rhodes were involved.Sir Abe Bailey, the owner of Transvaal Mines, who worked with Lord Milner tostart the Boer War, was among the founders of the RIIA, as was John W.Wheeler-Bennett, who would become General Eisenhower’s political advisor inLondon in the crucial last two years of the Second World War as the nature ofthe post war world was being developed. Chatham House at 10 St James’s Square,London, is named after William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham, one of three BritishPrime Ministers who have lived there. Goodness knows how many prime ministersand ministers have had their policies decided there, too.The Institute of International Affairs immediately began to infiltrate theeducation system and expand its influence across the world. In Britain it hashad a considerable sway at Oxford and other universities and within the LondonSchool of Economics. Funding this infiltration and the publications andpropaganda was never a problem. Whenever money is required, some part of theBrotherhood network will provide it. By 1926, the money was flowing in for booksand other work from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trustees, the Bank of England,and J.D. Rockefeller. The Rothschilds were, and are, the power behind thescenes. Within seven years of its launch, the funding of the Institute by themajor banks and multinationals was already established; this continues todaywith global companies making donations to the cause. In 1926, funding came from,among many others: The Bank of England; Barclays Bank; Lloyds, and Lloyds Bank;Westminster Bank; Midland Bank; Hambros Bank; Rothschild and Sons; Ford MotorCompany; Anglo-Iranian Oil (now BP); Baring Brothers; Imperial ChemicalIndustries (ICI); The British South Africa Company; the Mercantile and GeneralInsurance Company; Erlangers Ltd; Lever Brothers; Stern Brothers;Vickers-Armstrong; Central Mining and Industrial Investment Ltd; BritishAmerican Tobacco Company; Whitehall Securities Corporation; and Reuters, thenewsagency which supplies news to newspapers and the broadcast media across theworld.1In the years that followed, Institute branches were established in Australia,Canada, Namibia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and India, where itis known as the Council of World Affairs. By far the most important of theInstitute’s creations, however, was the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) inthe United States, which was to penetrate all areas of American life. This wasformed in 1921 at the Harold Pratt House at 58 East 68th Street in New York, theformer mansion of the Pratt family, close friends of the Rockefellers. Soonafterwards, the day-to-day administration was taken over by Colonel House andhis associates, including the Rockefellers and, particularly, J.P. Morgan. TheCFR’s founding president was John W. Davis, J.P. Morgan’s personal attorney; thefounding vice-president was Paul Gravath, from a law firm representing Morgan;and the council’s first chairman was the Morgan partner, Russell Leffingwell.Another ‘independent’ organisation, I see. The Council on Foreign Relations andthe Royal Institute of International Affairs are the same organisation, workingon different sides of the Atlantic to carry out the same goals and agenda. Theirmembers are in leading positions in government, including the Presidency,banking, business, education, military, and the media.The power of the Council on Foreign Relations grew rapidly, and today itcontrols the administration of the United States, especially its foreign policy.Its goal is to introduce world government and it has spanned the United Stateswith support groups. Each of these front organisations, like the CFR, has asimilar structure based on the Round Table. There are circles of membersanswering to a central elite. The inner circle knows the agenda and works fulltime towards that target. The next circle knows all or most of the agenda andseek to use their own sphere of influence, politics, banking, the media,whatever, to lead the world in the desired direction. Other circles of peopleknow some or a little of the real story and are persuaded to support theorganisation by accepting the idea that a world government is the only answer tothe ills of humanity. What this latter group doesn’t realise is that those illsare being created by the very organisations they are members of!Many of the people named in this book will not be involved through malice, butby genuinely believing that the New World Order agenda is the best option forpeace and stability. A few members of these Elite front-groups have had thecourage to speak out when they have seen the game plan. Admiral Chester Ward, aformer US Judge Advocate General of the Navy, was a member of the Council onForeign Relations for sixteen years. He said the purpose of the organisation wasthe “…submergence of US sovereignty and national independence into anall-powerful one-world government”. In his book, Kissinger On The Couch, writtenwith Phyllis Schafly, Ward said:> “…[the] lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United> States is pervasive throughout most of the membership, and particularly in the> leadership of several divergent cliques that make up what is actually a> polycentric organisation… [the main clique] is composed of the> one-world-global-government ideologists – more respectfully referred to as the> organised internationalists. They are the ones who carry on the tradition of> the founders.”2The writer James Perloff read every issue of the CFR’s magazine, ForeignAffairs, since its first publication in 1922. His verdict: “…the accusationsagainst the Council on Foreign Relations – the pursuit of world government andreceptiveness to communism are true”. He said the domination of Washingtonadministrations by the CFR membership had influenced “mightily upon the courseof American Foreign policy in this century… [which has] seen the United Stateseroded in strength and its allies sometimes vanquished altogether”.3 What wastrue of the CFR was true of all the other ‘think tanks’ that were to follow.The nexus of control which began in Britain and America was spreading across theworld throughout the 1920s and 30s. The Institute of Pacific Relations wasfounded in 1924 and headed by Jerome D. Greene, a Boston banker close to Morganand the Rockefellers. This was designed to extend the network into thegovernments and businesses of the Far East. Alongside Greene on the rulingcouncil was Lionel Curtis, the leading founder of the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. You will see throughout the book how the network offamiliar names and organisations keeps coming up whenever events are beingorchestrated. A Brotherhood mafia of organisations and people, controlled by thesame elite, cast a web of manipulation and deceit across the Atlantic fromLondon to New York and Washington, and then further afield, too.Much of the funding for this New World Order network comes from the tax-exemptfoundations. These are the foundations created by the big names of banking,industry, and finance, to make donations to various causes. People like theRockefeller, Ford, and Carnegie families all formed foundations and presentedthem as vehicles of philanthropy. In fact, they are used as tax havens in thename of charity while most of the money is actually channelled intoorganisations and subject areas which support and promote centralised control.This reality almost became public in the 1950s, but the Elite control of themedia just managed to keep the lid on the truth. The US Congress set up acommittee in 1953 under B. Carrol Reece of Tennessee to investigate thebehaviour of the tax-exempt foundations. Researcher and ‘insider’ CarrollQuigley says in his book, Tragedy And Hope:> “It soon became clear that people of immense wealth would be unhappy if the> investigation went too far and that the ‘most respected newspapers in the> country’, closely allied with these men of wealth, would not get excited> enough about any revelations to make the publicity worth while, in terms of> votes or campaign contributions.” (p995)What the papers didn’t get excited about were the Reece Committee’s findingsthat: the rich banking families give money to the foundations without losingcontrol of how it is spent; the major foundations are interconnected and work asone to a common policy; they took over social science in the US and suppressthose social scientists who disagree with their plans; research sponsored by thefoundations is often slanted to conform to the conclusions the funders demand;those educational institutions in America which refuse to conform are refused agrant; Rhodes scholars are fed into government service by the foundations;history books are being funded which keep the truth from the people. The ReeceCommittee discovered that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace waspromoting war and the foundations were presenting the United Nations as the basefor a socialist-communist coalition. All these findings came from an officialCongressional Committee.4This is still happening today and behind the names all these major foundations,including Ford and Carnegie, are controlled by the Rockefeller family. The FordFoundation came in for especially strong criticism. It gave a billion dollars tothe cause of ‘education’ and a million dollars to the Council on ForeignRelations. The foundations are another arm of global manipulation. Norman Doddwas the Reece Committee’s director of research and he interviewed the then FordFoundation president, H. Rowan Gaither, as part of his report. Gaither told himthat the Ford Foundation operated under directives from the White House andthese instructions were to make every effort to alter life in the United Statesto ensure a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union.5 The foundations areparticularly used to fund projects which aim to massage public opinion.In the years after World War I, the interconnecting networks of think tanks andfoundations had increased the effectiveness of the conspiracy. In these years,also, the manoeuvring went on that would explode as the Second World War. Thiswas another bankers’ conflict. Without their connivance, it could not havehappened. The Second World War was planned before Versailles. It was atVersailles that the Rothschild–Wall Street–Colonel House–Bernard Baruch–RoundTable connections imposed the impossible reparations on Germany which were sureto destroy the new German Democratic Republic and prepare the way for the riseof a dictator, Adolf Hitler. Added to this colossal debt, other decisions atVersailles had cost Germany 75% of her iron ore, 68% of her zinc, and 26% of hercoal. Soon France announced that Germany had defaulted on reparation paymentsand French troops occupied the Ruhr. This ‘defaulting’ turned out to be a smallshortfall in deliveries of coal and telegraph poles. The French move sent theGerman mark into freefall and it plunged to 7,592 to the dollar. This is hardlysurprising, given that the Ruhr produced 80% of Germany’s coal, iron, and steel.By November 1923, the mark had plummeted to 4,200 billion to the dollar!What followed was a double-strike by the Wall Street and British banking cartel,which first financed German rearmament and enabled Germany to prepare for thenext war, and then collapsed the German economy again to bring Adolf Hitler topower. These strikes were called the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. General C.Dawes was appointed by the US government to propose a solution to the Germanreparations fiasco. He introduced a series of short term loans from Wall Streetbanks to bail the Germans out. All this did, of course, was to add to the debtand put off the moment when the German economy would collapse, a collapse thatwas to be timed to bring Adolf Hitler to power. Lloyd George told the New YorkJournal American of June 24th 1924:> “The international bankers dictated the Dawes reparations settlement. The> protocol which was signed between the Allies and Associated Powers and Germany> is the triumph of the international financier. Agreement would never have been> reached without the brusque and brutal intervention of the international> bankers. They swept statesmen, politicians, and journalists to one side, and> issued their orders with the imperiousness of absolute monarchs, who knew> there was no appeal from their ruthless decrees. The settlement is the joint> ukase of King Dollar and King Sterling. The Dawes Report was theirs. They> inspired it and fashioned it. The Dawes Report was fashioned by the Money> Kings. The orders of German financiers [lead by the Warburg bank] to their> political representatives were just as peremptory as those of allied bankers> to their political representatives.”That was because the Allied and German bankers were on the same side. They wereconnected by the same All-Seeing Eye cult; a force which goes back to antiquity.The short-term loans issued under the Dawes Plan went into specific Germancompanies vital to rearmament. It was this money that expanded thepharmaceutical cartel known as I.G. Farben, which was, in reality, Hitler’s warmachine. Farben had produced poison gas in World War I, thanks to Germanfanatic, Fitz Haber. The rest of the money went to other German cartels or theGerman subsidiaries of American companies. These included A.E.G. (the GermanGeneral Electric), United Steelworks, and American I.G., the wholly-ownedsubsidiary of I.G. Farben. These loans, which included some from Morgan andRothschild companies, and the technology transfers from America to the Germancartels, made the Second World War possible. Without that help, there could havebeen no war. The US Ambassador to Germany, William Dodd, said in a communicationto President Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 19th 1936:> “At the present moment more than a hundred American corporations have> subsidiaries here of co-operative understandings. The DuPonts have three> allies in Germany that are aiding the armament business. Their chief ally is> the I.G. Farben Company, a part of the Government which gives 200,000 marks a> year to one propaganda organisation operating on American opinion. Standard> Oil Company (New York sub-company) sent $2,000,000 here in December 1933 and> has made $500,000 a year helping Germans make Ersatz gas for war purposes;> …The International Harvester Company president told me their business here> rose 33% a year (arms manufacture, I believe), but they could take nothing> out. Even our airplanes people have secret arrangements with Krupps. General> Motors Company [Morgan] and Ford do enormous business here through their> subsidiaries and take profits out. I mention these facts because they> complicate things and add to war dangers.”6This was a shocking story of involvement with Nazi Germany’s rearmament by majorUS companies and all the more compelling in that it came from the United Statesambassador to Germany. What did Roosevelt do? Nothing. Franklin D. Roosevelt, adistant cousin of an earlier president, Theodore Roosevelt, was brought to powerthrough a Wall Street-created depression in the United States, and was ensuredof election when Wall Street put its financial and media power behind him.Another supporter was Meyer Lansky, the head of the international crimesyndicate which included the Mafia. The term “Mafia” is often used to describethe organised crime network. In fact, the Italian Mafia is only a part of thepicture, albeit an important part. Lansky was actually top man in the syndicateand it was his money and bribes which helped Roosevelt to power.7 Once more thepeople of America were conned. Some of his prominent backers set up anorganisation to oppose him – a constantly repeated Global Elite strategy. Thiswas called the Liberty League and its pronouncements ensured that it would bebranded ‘extreme Right wing’ and ‘anti-Semitic’. This allowed all the mainopposition to Roosevelt, even the genuine people, to be dismissed as Right winganti-Semites. The Liberty League was funded by Pierre and Irene DuPont($325,000), J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, J. Howard Pew, and William J.Knudsen, who was later given a top job by the very president the Liberty League‘opposed’.8 In the same way the Robot Radicals of the political Left and theRobot Right all over the world are used today to discredit genuine opposition.The preparation of America and Germany for war and the rise of both Hitler andRoosevelt were remarkably similar. We have seen how the Elite collapsed theGerman economy. They were doing the same in America. During the 1920s, theyencouraged the stockmarket to overstretch itself and then the Federal Reserveissued a series of strict new banking laws which put the smaller banks underterrific pressure. This was the time of the so called ‘Turkey Shoot’, when theglobal banks picked off the small fry and massively increased their power. Whenthis process was over, the Federal Reserve withdrew the new banking laws. TheWall Street crash of 1929 plunged the country into economic depression.In the United States and Germany, the same solutions were offered. Borrow moremoney from the banks. Roosevelt’s National Recovery Act or ‘New Deal’ wasoffered to the American people as the way out of depression. Thousands of milesaway across the Atlantic, the same plan under another name was being offered tothe Germans by Hitler. Roosevelt’s New Deal was the work of Gerard Swope, amember of many Roosevelt organisations. He was the chairman of theMorgan-controlled International General Electric, and a director of GermanGeneral Electric (A.E.G.). Roosevelt was another version of Woodrow Wilson. LikeWilson, he would be elected by telling the people that America was not going towar while knowing that was exactly what was going to happen. Again ColonelEdward House was behind the scenes, visiting Roosevelt at his home in East 65thStreet, New York, almost every day in 1932.9What a ‘coincidence’ that Roosevelt and Hitler came to power in the wake ofeconomic depression with the same basic ‘New Deal’ type solutions, and that bothwere advised by people connected with the American-German cartels and theElite-controlled Bank of International Settlements. What’s more, they both tookoffice in the same year, 1933! Small world, isn’t it? Indeed, it is the samesmall world occupied by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan when they were inpower on both sides of the Atlantic during the 1980s, while following exactlythe same economic policies, Thatcherism and Reaganomics.Hitler’s rise to power was made certain after 1929 when the Dawes Plan ofshort-term loans came to an end with Germany now owing an extra $16 billion indebt. One of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s main financial backers, Owen D. Young, wasappointed to propose solutions to Germany’s inability to pay. Young was a Morganexecutive and the head of the Morgan-controlled General Electric. The Young Planof demanding payment in cash, not goods, demolished the German economy almostovernight. That is why he did it. A major financial supporter of Hitler, DrFritz Thyssen, would say under interrogation in 1945:> “The acceptance of the Young Plan and its financial principles increased> unemployment more and more until about one million were unemployed. People> were desperate. Hitler said he would do away with unemployment. The government> in power at that time was very bad, and the situation of the people was> getting worse. That really was the reason for the enormous success Hitler had> in the election. When the last election came, he got about 40%.”10The network linking both the Nazis and the Allies at the highest level is clearto see. While millions fought and died for what they believed was a war forfreedom, the same force was manipulating the whole thing through both sides.Without them, it would not have happened.The Austrian writer and researcher, Gertrude Elias, identifies Hjalmar Schachtas a major go-between, connecting the Nazis and the Wall Street-City of Londonelite.11 Schacht became Hitler’s financial advisor and President of theReichsbank. The two signatures on the document confirming Schacht’s appointmenton March 17th 1933, were Adolf Hitler and the Rothschild frontman, MaxWarburg.12 In 1930, Schacht also founded the Global Elite’s Bank ofInternational Settlements in Basle, Switzerland. In England, a key figure wasMontagu Norman (Comm 300), governor of the Rothschild-controlled Bank ofEngland, and a close friend of Schacht. In fact they were so close that Schachtnamed his grandson after him. It was Norman who pressed for and supported theraising of US interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which was the final pushthat led to the Wall Street crash, the New Deal, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.Norman was the most influential central banker in the world at that time and hisactions, in league with Wall Street, were crucial.Once Hitler was safely elected, the attitude of the Bank of England and theFederal Reserve to Germany was transformed. Credit was offered to the Naziregime and after the Nazis successfully invaded Czechoslovakia, Norman released£6 million of Czechoslovakian gold to Hitler which was deposited in London. Thiswas done with the agreement of the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain.13 OnJune 11th 1934, and again the following October, Norman and Schacht met insecret at Badenweiler in the Black Forest to arrange loans for Hitler and theNazis.14 But who was behind Norman? His family almost turned the governorship ofthe Bank of England into their personal property. One grandfather, George WardeNorman, was governor from 1821–1872 and his other grandfather, Lord Collet, wasgovernor from 1887–1889. Montagu Norman spent a period in the United States atthe offices of the Rothschild-funded Brown Brothers (later Brown Brothers,Harriman) and was befriended by the family of W.A. Delano (Comm 300), relativesof Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the President of the United States at the sametime that Norman was head of the Bank of England. This all-powerful banker wasactually a ‘yes man’ for the Rothschilds, and here again, we see the ploy atwork. He was portrayed as anti-Jewish.Today the Bank of England is still the feifdom of the Global Elite. GertrudeElias says that the Bank collaborated with the leading Zionist, Lord Bearsted ofRoyal Dutch Shell, to arrange the transfer of the assets of wealthy GermanZionists to Palestine. It was these transfers, she says, that helped to build upthe economy of the embryonic Zionist state. “They were the privileged emigreclass while propertyless Jews were refused asylum and neutralised in theholocaust”, Elias adds.15 I believe that all this was coldly calculated by the‘Jewish’ elite, for reasons I will come to in due course.I don’t want to send you to sleep with a mass of detail, but I do want to makeit clear how provable it is that the Second World War and the rise of Hitlerwere creations of the Elite in Britain and America. We need to move away fromconspiracy theory and see that it is conspiracy fact. Only then will we dealwith it. Crucial to the rise of the Nazi war machine was the behaviour of someof the most famous companies in the United States, who supported Hitler viatheir German subsidiaries or partners. Here are just a few of what were almostcountless examples of how this was secretly done…I.G. Farben/Standard OilGerman production of steel and other products needed for war soared through theperiod leading up to the outbreak of the conflict in 1939. At the centre of thisrearmament was the chemical giant, I.G. Farben. As Senator Homer T. Bone wouldsay to a Senate Committee in 1943 “Farben was Hitler and Hitler was Farben”.16This immense cartel was created in its wartime form by American loans! In 1939,with Wall Street investment, it had become the biggest manufacturer of chemicalsin the world. And who controlled I.G. Farben, a company that would use Jews andothers as slave labour? The Rothschilds, via a stream of frontmen and companies.Among the German bankers on the supervisory board of Farben into the late 1920swas Max Warburg, the brother of Paul Warburg of the Manhattan Bank, who was sentto the United States by the Rothschilds to install the Federal Reserve Systemand to take over the US economy. These were quite a pair, operating in concertin the US and Germany. The US Naval Secret Service Report of December 2nd 1918said: “Paul Warburg. German, nationalised US citizen 1911, decorated by Kaiser,handled large sums furnished by German bankers for Lenin and Trotsky. Hisbrother Max who is director of espionage system of Germany”.17 Paul Warburg wason the board of Farben’s American subsidiary, American I.G. Sitting alongsidehim were Edsel Ford (son of Henry) of the Ford Motor Company, Charles E. Michellfrom the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Walter Teagle, FranklinRoosevelt’s close friend from Standard Oil. All this top American influence andsupport for a company of which an American War Department report said:> “Without I.G.’s immense productive facilities, its intense research, and vast> international affiliations, Germany’s prosecution of the war would have been> unthinkable and impossible. Farben not only directed its energies toward> arming Germany, but concentrated on weakening her intended victims, and this> double-barrelled attempt to expand the German industrial potential for war and> to restrict that of the rest of the world was not conceived and executed ‘in> the normal course of business’. The proof is overwhelming that I.G. Farben> officials had full prior knowledge of Germany’s plan for world conquest and of> each specific aggressive act later undertaken…” 18The Farben Empire became a state within a state and in effect ran its owneconomy. Reports and investigations, during and after the war, show thatFarben’s role, with Wall Street and British support, was to make Germanyself-sufficient in all that Hitler needed for war: products like rubber, petrol,oils, and explosives. One major problem they had was the supply of oil. Theirsupplies came from outside Germany and in 1934 around 85% of German petroleumproducts were imported. This would obviously dry up during a war. But a dealbetween Farben and the Rockefellers ensured a constant supply of oil to Germany.Farben began to invest vast sums from the Wall Street loans into research aimedat developing processes to make oil from the German reserves of coal. What theycouldn’t discover for themselves, the Rockefeller’s Standard Oil gave to them!In January 1933, just before Hitler came to power, a report from the CommercialAttache at the US Embassy in Berlin said:> “In two years Germany will be manufacturing oil and gas enough out of soft> coal for a long war. The Standard Oil of New York is furnishing millions of> dollars to help.”19The Rockefellers also helped I.G. Farben with chemicals essential to aircraftfuel. The American representatives of American I.G. tried to hide theircompany’s involvement with the German war machine by merging American I.G. intoanother company and changing its name to the General Aniline and FilmCorporation. In fact, the makeup of the American I.G. board of 1930, with Farbenalready five years into its preparation for war, tells the real story of theUS-German Brotherhood network which was leading the world into yet anotherawesome conflict. Among the board members of American I.G. were: Carl Bosch(German), from Ford; Edsel B. Ford (US), Henry Ford’s son; Max Ilgner (German),director of Farben’s Nazi intelligence office in Berlin; H.A. Metz (US) directorof I.G. Farben and the Rothschild/Warburg Bank of Manhattan; C.E. Mitchell (US),Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Morgan National CityBank; Hermann Schmitz (German), president of American I.G. and I.G. Farben andon the boards of both the German Central Bank and the Bank of InternationalSettlements; Walter Teagle (US), director of Federal Reserve Bank of New York,the Rockefellers’ Standard Oil of New Jersey, trustee of the RooseveltFoundation, and close friend of the President; W.H. von Rath (naturalised US),director of German General Electric (A.E.G.); and Paul M. Warburg, of the Bankof Manhattan.When the war ended and the investigations into its background began, threeGerman members of that American I.G. board were found guilty at the NurembergWar Crimes Trials. The American representatives such as Paul Warburg were leftuntouched, as was his brother, Max Warburg, who, even though a Jew, was allowedto leave Nazi Germany in 1939 without any restriction. The Elite controlled eventhe arrests and trials resulting from the war and the horrors they themselvesengineered. Such operations were not only between two companies, they involvedother elements of the Global Elite-Brotherhood in other companies andgovernments. The president of Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon) at thistime was William Stamps Farish. During the war, a letter was released by the USJustice Department from Frank A. Howard, the Standard Oil vice-president toFarish. It was dated October 12th 1939, and it said:> “…In England I met by appointment the Royal Dutch [Shell Oil] gentleman from> Holland and…a general agreement was reached on the necessary changes in our> relations with the I.G. [Farben], in view of the state of war…the Royal Dutch> Shell Group is essentially British…I also had several meetings with the> [British] Air Ministry…> “I required help to obtain the necessary permission to go to Holland…After> discussions with the [American] Ambassador [Joseph Kennedy]…the situation was> cleared completely…The gentlemen in the Air Ministry…very kindly offered to> assist me in re-entering England.> “Pursuant to these arrangements, I was able to keep my appointment in Holland> (having been flown there on a British Royal Air Force bomber), where I had> three days of discussion with the representatives of I.G. They delivered to me> assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and we did our best to work out> complete plans for a modus vivendi which could operate through the term of the> war, whether or not the US came in.”20 [my emphasis]William S. Farish refuelled Nazi shipping and submarines in Spain and LatinAmerica during the war. It was the Standard Oil-I.G. Farben enterprise whichopened the Auschwitz Concentration Camp on June 14th 1940, and used the slavelabour of Jews and political opponents to produce the artificial rubber andgasoline from coal. Farish was very close to Hermann Schmitz, the chairman ofI.G. Farben. Standard Oil hired the infamous publicist, Ivy Lee, to promoteFarben and the Nazis in the United States. William S. Farish had a grandson,William Farish III, who was to become a close friend of George Bush (Comm 300)and has enjoyed the company of Queen Elizabeth II (Comm 300) at his home. Theirhorses breed with each other, apparently. When George Bush becamevice-president, he had to hand over his businesses and investments to a ‘blindtrust’, to ensure that he could not (in theory) make decisions in the WhiteHouse which affected his investments. Who was put in charge of this ‘blindtrust’? William Farish III!General Electric (G.E.C.)I.G. Farben worked in concert before and throughout the war with other cartelslike the J.P. Morgan-controlled General Electric, a company with which PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt had many close connections. In 1939, Senator James A. Reedof Missouri, a one-time Roosevelt supporter, told the Senate that the Presidentwas a “hired man for the economic royalists”, in Wall Street. He added that theRoosevelt family was one of the biggest holders of shares in General Electric.21Interesting, then, that General Electric was a big Hitler supporter and there isphotographic and documented evidence that, like I.G. Farben, both GeneralElectric companies in Germany, A.E.G. and Osram, directly financed Hitler.22Farben contributed the most (45% of the fund that brought Hitler to power in1933), but the companies linked to General Electric also made very largedonations and – in this web of intrigue – a number of directors of GermanGeneral Electric were on the board of I.G. Farben. As with the other majorAmerican companies involved, General Electric (in the US) channelled itscontributions to Hitler via German subsidiaries and cartel partners. Again onlythe German directors of the General Electric cartel were charged and tried atNuremberg, not the Americans. To have done so would have exposed the wholestory.International Telephone and Telegraph (I.T.T.)Another United States company that was important to Hitler and his war machinewas International Telephone and Telegraph, better known as I.T.T. It was thecreation of its founder, Sosthenes Behn, an entrepreneur born in the VirginIslands. By 1924, I.T.T. was closely connected with J.P. Morgan, and the boardreflected Morgan’s control. It has been proved that I.T.T. made donations toHitler through German subsidiaries and was a significant supporter of the Naziregime.23 I.T.T. bought a large interest in German armament companies, mostparticularly the aircraft manufacturer, Focke-Wolfe. The profits from theseinvestments were not returned to the United States; they were reinvested infurther German rearmament. Sosthenes Behn met with Hitler in August 1933.24Hitler’s personal banker, Baron Kurt von Schroder, a Nazi and SS Senior GroupLeader, became the overseer of I.T.T. interests in Germany and a director of allI.T.T.-affiliated companies. Baron von Schroder was channelling I.T.T. fundingto Himmler’s SS at least until 1944!25 The Schroder Banking family from Hamburghad branches in London and New York under the name of J. Henry Schroder (Comm300). In England, the managing director of Schroder Bank was Mr F.C. Tiarks, adirector of the Rothschild-controlled and Montagu Norman-supervised Bank ofEngland. Gordon Richardson was chairman of Schroder Bank up until 1973, when hewas made governor of the Bank of England. From 1938 on, the Schroder Bank inLondon was appointed to represent Nazi interests in Britain. In America,Schroder and the Rockefellers merged some of their business interests.The Ford Motor CompanyMuch has been written of Henry Ford’s alleged collusion with the Nazis. He wasvehement in his condemnation of the Jews. Ford was just as outspoken in hiscriticism of the Wall Street financiers, whom he blamed for starting the warsand controlling the world money markets for their own ends. At the same time, hesaid J.P. Morgan was to be trusted and I can’t help feeling that Mr Ford did hisutmost to spread disinformation. He portrayed himself as the peoples’ friendagainst the manipulators while he was, in fact, another manipulator. He madeenormous profits during the war by supplying both sides. As early as 1922, theNew York Times was reporting that Ford was financing Hitler’s nationalists andanti-Jewish movements in Germany and the Berlin newspaper, Berliner Tageblatt,was calling on the American ambassador to stop Ford from intervening in Germanaffairs. Hitler was so grateful for Ford’s assistance, that in 1938 he presentedFord with the highest honour the Nazis conferred on non-Germans: the Grand Crossof the German Eagle; Ford’s portrait hung behind Hitler’s desk in Hitler’sprivate office. The two biggest manufacturers of tanks for Hitler’s armiesbefore and during the war were the German subsidiaries of the Ford MotorCompany, and the Morgan-controlled General Motors (Opel). In 1928, the FordMotor Company in Germany merged with I.G. Farben. Carl Bosch of Farben becamethe head of the Ford operation in Germany.W.A. HarrimanFritz Thyssen was a German steel entrepreneur and banker, who funded the Nazisfrom the early 1920s. His banking operation in Germany was affiliated – througha subsidiary – with the W.A. Harriman Company in New York (Brown Brothers,Harriman after 1933), which in turn was funded (at least in its earlier days) bythe Rothschilds. The Harriman family was prominent in supporting both theRussian Revolution and Adolf Hitler. A Thyssen company controlled the UnionBanking Corporation in the US, which had E. Roland Harriman on its board alongwith known Nazis and Nazi financial backers. Prescott Bush, the father of thefuture president, George Bush, was also on the UBC board and owed his wealth tothe Harrimans. Roland was the brother of W. Averell Harriman (Comm 300), who wasa director of Morgan’s Guaranty Trust when it was financing Lenin and Trotsky.Averell Harriman would later make vast profits from Russian ventures and beappointed as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. He was also a controlling voicein the Democratic Party and close to the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt.The Dulles BrothersThe name Dulles is another which spans the manipulation of both the First andSecond World Wars. The Dulles’s were from a southern slave-owning family, andcousins of the Rockefellers. They were connected with international banking inAmerica and Germany. Statements made by John Foster Dulles as early as 1911revealed support for the creation of a ‘super race’ by ‘eliminating the lowermembers…’.26 The Dulles law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, handled the US affairsof I.G. Farben and Hitler’s major financial backer, Fritz Thyssen, whointroduced Allen Dulles to the Fuhrer-to-be. John Foster Dulles wrote ‘HeilHitler’ on his letters to German clients. After Hitler’s rise to power, JohnFoster Dulles went to Germany on behalf of the Rothschild/Round Table group, tonegotiate new loans for the Nazis. The Dulles brothers were appointed to the USState Department during World War I by their uncle, Secretary of State, RobertLansing, one of the Colonel House/Bernard Baruch clique which controlled WoodrowWilson. The Dulles brothers were at the Versailles Peace Conference where theymet the Round Table delegation and became part of the Round Table/RoyalInstitute of International Affairs/Council on Foreign Relations network. AllenDulles was, very conveniently, appointed First Secretary of the US Embassy inBerlin in 1920, just as his brother was in Germany, representing the Elite’sbankers through his connections with the Bank of England and the J.P. Morganempire. Both Dulles’ were friends of Hitler’s financial wizard, Hjalmar Schacht.John Foster Dulles would become Secretary of State and Allen Dulles became thefirst head of the CIA. The latter would also serve on the Warren Commission,which was charged with investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.I have highlighted some of the big names in the financing and manipulation ofGermany and her rearmament programme. But there was also direct support for theNazi Party by these same banks and industrialists. Among the documents from theNuremberg Trials are the original transfer slips from I.G. Farben, GermanGeneral Electric, Osram, and others, authorising the transfer of funds into theNazis’ National Trusteeship account, Hitler’s election fund. Representatives ofcompanies owned or influenced by the Rockefellers, American I.G., I.T.T.,General Electric, and Ford can be shown to be at the heart of the Nazi Party.27It is fascinating to see how remarkably free from bomb damage were the Germanfactories and plants owned by the American-German cartels. When the Alliedarmies reached Cologne, for instance, many noticed the stark contrast betweenthe flattened city and the undamaged plants (owned by I.G. Farben, the FordMotor Company, and the United Rayon Works) on its edge. The way I.G. Farbenplants survived the bombing is staggering, given that the Allies knew that thiscompany was the German war machine. There is evidence that Ford Plants inGermany and France were not bombed by the US Airforce.28 When the one at Poissywas hit by the British, the Vichy government paid Ford 38 million francs incompensation! A relieved Edsel Ford wrote to his General Manager in Europe:“Photographs of the Plant on fire were published in American newspapers butfortunately no reference was made to the Ford Motor Company”.29 The Vichy regimecollaborated with the Nazis and among its number was one François Mitterand(Comm 300), Grand Master of Grand Orient Freemasonry and later the long-timepresident of France.30In five years of war and global slaughter, the United States trusts I havehighlighted, and others, made a profit of $175,000,000,000, according toresearch by the writer and researcher, Gertrude Elias.31To complete this appalling tale of deceit on the people of the world, the sameWall Street names that created and funded the war were also appointed byFranklin Roosevelt to supervise the fate of German industry when the conflictended. Top executives appointed to this role included Louis Douglas, director ofthe Morgan-dominated General Motors and president of the Morgan Mutual LifeInsurance, and Brigadier General William H. Draper Jr of Dillon, Read, and Co,another firm that contributed substantially to the creation of the cartels andthe funding of Hitler’s Germany. Both Draper and Douglas were members of theCouncil on Foreign Relations and Draper, a eugenics (master race) fanatic, wouldlater become a leading light in the funding of ‘population control’.The story of William H. Draper Jr reveals the scale of the scam and thecover-up. He joined the Prescott Bush circle in 1927, when he was hired byDillon Read to handle the account of…Fritz Thyssen, one of Adolf Hitler’sbiggest financial backers. Draper became a director and later the vice-presidentand assistant treasurer of Dillon Read’s German Credit and InvestmentCorporation, supervising some of the short-term loans to Thyssen’s German SteelTrust under the Dawes Plan. These loans, agreed upon by Draper, helped to bringHitler to power and fund his rearmament. His partners in this operation wereboth Nazis: Alexander Kreuter, in Berlin, was president, and Frederic Brandi(who moved to the US in 1926) became Draper’s co-director of the German CreditInvestment Corporation in Newark, New Jersey. Brandi’s father was a leading coalexecutive with the German Steel Trust. Draper was listed as a director of GermanCredit throughout 1942 until it was liquidated in 1943, by which time its jobhad been done.32Draper then went off to become a general in the Pacific, fighting for the USA!This is the man appointed by Roosevelt after the German surrender to decide whatshould happen to the Nazi cartels he helped to create. He would have power todecide who was exposed, who lost or kept their business, and who was chargedwith war crimes. The scale of the sting is incredible. Draper played goodguy/bad guy with US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, to complete anothermental coup d’état. Morganthau demanded that Germany’s industry be destroyed andthe Germans be reduced to a purely rural nation. Draper’s role was to preventthis, but only if the Germans agreed to accept all the guilt for Nazism. Theauthors of a superb book, George Bush, The Unauthorised Biography, say:> “Draper and his colleagues demanded that Germany and the world accept the> collective guilt of the German people as the explanation of the rise of> Hitler’s New Order and the Nazi war crimes. This, of course, was rather> convenient for General Draper himself, as it was for the Bush family. It is> still convenient decades later, allowing Prescott’s son, President George, to> lecture Germany on the danger of Hitlerism. Germans are too slow, it seems, to> accept his New World Order.” (p55)The threads have continued through the decades since then, with President Bushappointing Draper’s son, William Draper III, to a United Nations job involved inpopulation control. At Dillon Read, Bush’s US Treasury Secretary, NicholasBrady, was the long-time partner of Frederic Brandi, General Draper’s cohort inthe financing of Hitler’s steel cartel. The same small group of bankers,companies, and political manipulators were behind the First World War, theRussian Revolution, and the Second World War. Without their money andmanoeuvring, the two greatest conflicts in recorded human history would not havehappened.Why is it important to know this? There are many reasons, but I stress two. Ihave heard it said so often that the problem with the world is human nature.This nature is evil, I hear people say, and what do they point to injustification of this? The two World Wars and other conflicts before and since.Our desire for multidimensional freedom will only become a reality when werealise that human nature is not evil. It has a natural desire for love, nothate, for harmony, not conflict. Those wars were not the result of human naturebeing evil. They were the result of humanity giving away to someone else itsright to think and act. These are lessons which are still to be learned anduntil they are, we will continue to be denied our true and infinite potential.But we can make that switch in an instant, if we so choose.We are having a version of events projected at us through the schools,universities, and the media, all the time. That version of events has almostnothing to do with truth. It has been created to mislead us and to persuade usto think and act in a particular way, which suits the aims of the humanmanipulators and their controllers, the Prison Warders. So if you want to go towar and you need the people to support you, just set up an attack on one of yourown ships or have one of your top people assassinated, and whip up the public’sindignation with propaganda against the alleged culprit. As long as people takeeverything at face value, without question, and they don’t survey the world withopen eyes and an open mind, we will go on being a bewildered herd, blindlyfollowing the sheep at the front. But is it a sheep – or a monster? And what isits agenda? If we stop being human blotting paper, soaking up this tidal wave ofbiased information, and begin to filter what we are told, we become so much moredifficult to mislead. These terrible events which have plagued the world in thiscentury can only happen if we see life in terms of the leaders and the led. Ifwe do that, a tiny few can control the world. And they have.

As the Prison Warders program the minds ofthe Global Elite, so the Elite do the same to people on Earth. It almostwouldn’t matter that the global bankers and industrialists were funding bothsides – if (and it is one hell of a big ‘if’) the people in general had seenwhat was afoot and refused to take part. I remember the words of a splendid songby Donovan in the 1960s, The Universal Soldier:> “He’s five foot two, and he’s six feet four. He fights with missiles and with> spears. He’s all of thirty-one and he’s only seventeen. He’s been a soldier> for a thousand years…He’s the universal soldier and he really is to blame.> Without him how could Hitler have begun? He’s the one who gives his body as a> weapon of the war and without him all this killing can’t go on.” 1Hitler was no threat to the world unless the mass of the German people handedover their lives to him. Unfortunately, this is what happened, and the same wastrue of people in Britain and elsewhere, who also gave up thinking and allowed‘leaders’ to ‘do it’ for them. In Germany, you had the propaganda whipping uppublic opinion against a perceived enemy and their egos were being massaged bytalk of a German Master Race. Outside Germany, the same force was orchestratingpublic opinion against the Germans, once Hitler’s rearmament programme wassufficiently advanced. When the two populations had soaked up the designerpropaganda, they were played off against each other. Most of the people whofought that war did not want to be there. They wanted to be at home with theirfamilies and to watch their children grow. But because they had given up theirright to think, they left their families and children, to kill and be killed.Their minds were so overwhelmed by the mass hypnosis, that those who did standup and challenge the official line were jailed without trial and few raised evena whimper against it. But by then, especially with the First World War and theGreat Depression still powerfully affecting human responses, the collective mindwas full of fear. It had lost confidence in itself. It was confused, bewildered,and looking to others to change the nature of the human condition. The humanmind had also been programmed, not the least by its recent experience, tobelieve that life was about conflict and struggle: the world was a horribleplace. These were the dominating thought patterns and that was the physicalreality thus created.Uniting a nation against a common enemy and convincing the people of their ownracial superiority is another powerful weapon of control. The Nazis used this togreat effect with their German Master Race/anti-Jewish propaganda. Ironically,or perhaps more than that, they were assisted in this by a man called AlfredRosenberg, an occultist with a Jewish, Estonian, and French background. It wasRosenberg who made a copy of The Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zionavailable to Hitler. Why on Earth did he do that, when he would have known thatHitler would use them as propaganda against Jews as a whole? Hitler did indeedcirculate The Protocols widely to justify his campaign against Jews. This wasoutrageous, given that the mass of Jewish people were not aware of what wasgoing on and nor would they have supported it if they were.Rosenberg said that a stranger arrived mysteriously and gave him a copy of thedocument: “The man, whom I had never seen before, came to my study withoutknocking, put the book on my desk and vanished without saying a word”.2Rosenberg presented himself as vehemently anti-Jewish and soon rose to becomethe Nazi Party’s official ‘ideologist’, with the role of providing the ‘facts’to justify the campaign against Jews. Ernst Hanfstaengl, a close friend ofFranklin Roosevelt, was also a close associate of Hitler before the war. He sayshe was warned by the Austrian writer, Rudolf Kommer, that “if any politicalparty emerges with an anti-Semitic programme directed by Jewish or half Jewishfanatics we shall have to watch out”. Hanfstaengl wrote that later, afterexperiencing the influence that Alfred Rosenberg had on Hitler, he began torealise what that remark really meant:> “I thought back to Rudolf Kommer’s remark about an anti-Semitic programme> directed by Jewish or half Jewish fanatics – Rosenberg was distinctly Jewish> in appearance, although he would have been the first to protest furiously if> anyone had questioned his ancestry. Yet I used to see him most mornings> sitting in a dingy café at the corner of Briennerstrasse and Augustenstrasse> with a Hungarian Jew named Holoschi, who was one of his principal assistants.> The man called himself Hollander in Germany and was another of these Jewish> anti-Semites…I suspected the Aryan background of many of the others, Strasser> and Streicher looked Jewish to me as well as figures like Ley, Frank and even> Goebbels, who would have had difficulty in proving their pedigree.” 3Now isn’t this all rather strange? Jewish bankers and their politicalrepresentatives were provably involved in funding the Nazis and theirrearmament. Then along comes Alfred Rosenberg from a Jewish background, to handover a copy of The Protocols to Hitler and to become the chief ‘researcher’ ofanti-Jewish material which leads to the grotesque treatment of Jews under theNazi regime. This treatment is then used and hyped to justify the takeover ofPalestine for a ‘Jewish’ homeland. No-one used this method more obviously thanLord Victor Rothschild in his House of Lords speeches urging support for aJewish State in Palestine. What goes on here? I believe it was all a set up bythe Elite. Hitler’s infamous book, Mein Kampf, was ghostwritten by Major GeneralKarl Haushofer, who acknowledged that a major source for the “ideas” itexpressed came from Halford J. MacKinder, a director of the elite’s LondonSchool of Economics. In 1996, official German documents uncovered by an Americanstudent also proved that many of Hitler’s leading officers and thousands of histroops were of Jewish decent.In Britain, it seems to me, the public mind was being urged to ignore Hitleruntil his rearmament programme was well established. Then, when the Germans wereready for battle, that same public opinion was switched dramatically to seeHitler as a monster who must be stopped. The British collective psyche was likea little child in the hands of the mind doctors. This policy, I believe, wascoordinated by Lord Milner and the Round Table secret society, together with theRoyal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House. The two front men forthese two very different stages were Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and hissuccessor, Winston Churchill (Comm 300).Chamberlain and his close aide, Lord Halifax (a Round Table member almost fromits foundation and a member of the Committee of 300), supported the appeasementof Hitler. Milner and his fellow manipulators agreed with this policy. Speechesby the Round Table/Royal Institute high command like Lionel Curtis (Comm 300),Leopold Amery, and Lord Lothian were strongly in favour of leaving Hitler aloneduring the 1930s. In May 1933, Hitler’s representative (Alfred Rosenberg)visited England to meet with Sir Henry Deterding (Comm 300), head of Royal DutchShell; Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper (owned by the Astors(Round Table, Royal Institute)), Walter Eliot MP; 1st Viscount Hailsham, theSecretary for War; and the Duke of Kent, brother of King Edward VIII and KingGeorge VI. Edward, who is believed to have had sympathies with Hitler, laterfell in love with an American woman, Mrs Simpson. He abdicated from the Britishthrone and moved to the Rothschild castle in Austria after reigning for only 325days. There is speculation that the real reason he left Britain was because hewould not support a war with Germany, which the manipulators knew was planned.When Hitler announced the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, the BritishCabinet accepted it. The Astors used their Times newspaper to promote this viewof Hitler also. The authorised biographer of Lord Halifax shows how the Milnercrowd and the British Cabinet were negotiating behind the scenes with Germany,and making proposals that would have given Hitler control over mainland Europe.This was part of a British-German-United States pact proposed by Milner’sassociate Lord Lothian in a meeting with Hitler in January 1935. Lord Halifaxalso met with Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19th 1937. Carroll Quigley’sresearch for The Anglo-American Establishment reveals that Halifax (Comm 300)convinced Hitler of three points: a) that Britain saw Germany as the maindefence against communism in Europe; b) that Britain was prepared to be part ofa Four Power agreement with France, Germany and Italy; c) that Britain wouldallow Germany to liquidate Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, if it could beachieved without British public opinion demanding a war with Germany.4 Allelements of the Round Table, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, andtheir associated organisations, publications, and members, were put to work tosell the appeasement policy.The only thing that could have started a war with Germany earlier than plannedwas British public opinion, so the appeasement propaganda was stepped up. A fewmonths after the Halifax/Hitler meeting, the Nazis invaded Austria in March1938. The French Prime Minister, Daladier, went to London to ask for Britishsupport for the protection of Czechoslovakia against Hitler’s aggression.Chamberlain refused. More than that, it would appear that the French were urgedto pressure the Czechs into an agreement with Hitler. Lord Lothian made speechesin the House of Lords and at Chatham House condemning the Czechs for not makingconcessions to Germany.5 In a meeting with American newspaper journalists at theAstors’ London home, Chamberlain made a calculated, but deniable, comment,indicating that he believed the Czechs should hand over some of their land toGermany.6 Lady Astor denied the meeting had taken place when the news was madepublic, but later had to admit that it had.The policy Chamberlain had outlined for the journalists was supported in aleading article in The Times newspaper, owned by the Astors. This produced suchan outcry of protest that the manipulation of public opinion was furtherincreased. The article appeared on September 7th 1938 because they knew theGerman invasion of Czechoslovakia was near. Later in that month, Lord Halifaxand others launched a propaganda exercise known as the ‘war scare’. Thegovernment circulated stories which greatly exaggerated the strength of theGerman forces. They implied that if they went to war with Hitler, German planeswould soon be dropping poison gas from their aeroplanes over England. Thegovernment even went to the ridiculous lengths of digging trenches in Londonparks and distributing gas masks! But, of course, silly as that may have been –what use are trenches in the parks? – it was not their military usefulness thegovernment was interested in. It was about mind manipulation. They wanted tofrighten public opinion into thinking that going to war with Germany was notsuch a good idea after all. Chamberlain added to this by saying on BBC Radiothat the dispute between Germany and Czechoslovakia was: “…a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing”.7 The Nazi invasion ofCzechoslovakia was, in truth, crucial to the plan because it gave Hitler theresources he needed to be a major military power, capable of fighting aprolonged war. The writer, Gertrude Elias, says of this:> “Most revealing even for the present are the deals which preceded the sell-out> of Czechoslovakia by Chamberlain in 1939, which turned Germany into a military> superpower. The fact was, however, that the Skoda works, the biggest munition> factory in Central Europe, controlled by the French Schneider Creuzot, like> Wittowitz, the biggest steelworks owned by the Rothschilds, like the Czech> explosives, had already been handed over to Germany…> “…The death warrant [for Czechoslovakia] was signed in the head office of the> Unilever subsidiary in Aussig, the headquarters of the pro-Nazi clique.” 8When Germany occupied the whole of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, there was asudden and remarkable switch in the attitude of Milner and the Round Table. Nowthey were all in favour of war with Germany. The time had arrived for the secondstrike in the Elite’s pre-war strategy in Britain. Chamberlain had served hispurpose in giving Hitler time to rebuild German armaments (with Wall Streetsupport) and Germany’s area of influence had expanded. Dictators of a similarpersuasion were installed in Italy (Mussolini) and Spain (Franco). OK boys,we’re ready to go. Start the war.Hitler had been duped, too, into believing there would be no opposition, butsuddenly that was to change. The Milner group, through its publication, TheRound Table magazine, had been pressing for the appeasement of Hitler throughoutthe period we have been discussing. Now it was calling for a ‘Grand Alliance’ ofPoland, Rumania, France, and Britain, against Germany. Lord Lothian and LordAstor, those arch appeasers, were suddenly making speeches saying exactly theopposite of what they had said before. “War with Germany!” they cried. Lothianwas also calling for an alliance with Russia. They demanded a policy ofconscription into the armed forces, as did Astor’s Times9 and Lord Amery, theman who had supported Hitler so vigorously. The switch in policy wasn’t evensubtle. It was painfully transparent if you knew the Elite game plan.Chamberlain’s use to the Elite was almost over. His successor, Winston Churchill(Comm 300), was being manoeuvred into place. All that was left was to removeChamberlain and the knives of his former ‘friends’ were sharpened. There can befew greater examples of hypocrisy in the House of Commons chamber than whenLeopold Amery, echoing Cromwell, shouted at the government benches: “You havesat too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us havedone with you. In the name of God, go!”10 Go for pursuing the policies Ameryadvocated right up to the sudden switch of 1939. Lady Astor who had supportedChamberlain’s policy to the hilt, turned against him even earlier: “Will thePrime Minister lose no time in letting the German government know with whathorror the whole of this country regards Germany’s action?” she asked him in1939. Chamberlain didn’t answer, but another Conservative MP, Major VyvyanAdams, summed it up when he shouted at Lady Astor: “You caused it yourself”.11Chamberlain was simply a scapegoat, knowingly or unknowingly. Churchill becamePrime Minister. A man of war was now in Downing Street and on the very eveninghe took over the reins of the British Empire, May 11th 1940, the policy ofbombing civilian targets began. The Churchill family has links with theRothschilds (Comm 300). Winston’s father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was funded bythe House of Rothschild while he was British Chancellor of the Exchequer in themid 1800s and his closest friend was Nathaniel Rothschild. When RandolphChurchill died, he was in debt to the Rothschilds to the tune of some £65,000.12Winston, too, was in debt to them and he was a good friend of Lord VictorRothschild and the Rothschild’s arch manipulator in America, Bernard Baruch.13The names of Rothschild and Churchill continue to crop up together today. In1995, some of Churchill’s papers and speeches were controversially sold by hisfamily to the National Heritage Memorial Fund for £12,500,000, thanks to moneyacquired from the National Lottery. The Chairman of the National HeritageMemorial Fund, which agreed to buy the papers for such a large sum, is LordJacob Rothschild. Also important were Churchill’s close links with BernardBaruch and the elite family known as the Cecils. Indeed they controlled him to alarge extent. The Cecils have longtime connections with the networks set up byanother elite front, the Jesuits, and to other families in the European elitelike the Habsburgs and the Black Nobility of Italy. Churchill knew exactly whathe was doing.Within a fortnight of walking into 10 Downing Street, Churchill was using theinfamous ‘Regulation 18b’ to imprison hundreds of British people who opposed thewar or pointed out that it was being engineered by a secret force.14 Thisapproach must be noted in any guide to freedom. It is one thing to usepropaganda to feed public opinion a particular line, but if you are amanipulator, you also need to stop anyone who is voicing alternativeinformation. What the British administration did was to use Regulation 18b toimprison – without trial – those who sought to reveal who was really creatingthe war, and to justify this in the public mind with press claims of asubversive ‘Fifth Column’ at work in Britain, in support of Hitler. Regulation18b had been introduced before the war in response to bombings in London whichhad been blamed on the IRA. It conveniently allowed people to be imprisonedpurely on ‘suspicion’. There was no need for the State to prove anything and Ican’t help thinking that this law was another case of: create the ‘problem’ (theLondon bombings blamed on the IRA) and then offer the ‘solution’: a regulationthat gives you the power to arrest and imprison whomever you like, whenever youlike, during the war you already know is coming. One lady, a Mrs Nicholson, thewife of a distinguished admiral, was arrested, tried, and acquitted on allcounts of being involved in a ‘Fifth Column’. As she left the court, cleared ofall charges by a judge and jury, she was arrested under Regulation 18b andimprisoned for several years. This was happening in a country, under Churchill,that was supposed to be fighting for freedom! Who was the British intelligenceofficer in charge of the prosecutions under Regulation 18b? Lord VictorRothschild, the friend, I would say manipulator, of Churchill.15 Rothschildcontrolled the intelligence operative who was officially in charge of 18b,Maxwell Knight. Intelligence researcher, Doctor Kitty Little, who investigatedLord Rothschild’s activities for fifty years, told me:> “Being in control of counter-subversion and the administration of 18b gave> Rothschild plenty of scope for subversive activities. He was able to ensure> that members of the three covert sections of his organisation were protected> from investigation, while he used 18b in two ways. On the one hand he was able> to intern people like Fuchs [the Soviet spy and nuclear physicist, Klaus> Fuchs, who later worked on the atomic bomb project] and send them to the camp> in Canada where they received training in subversive organisation or sought to> thwart the activities of its members. Since then many other people whose> normal patriotism or whose normal scientific activities have run counter to> the desires of subversive agents, have found their careers and influence> inexplicably hampered and thwarted. His agents reached the stage when> patriotism was routinely smeared as ‘fascist’, or ‘extreme Right wing’, or> ‘racist’ or ‘anti-Semitic’.”16A famous victim of Regulation 18b was the Conservative MP, Captain ArchibaldMaule Ramsey, formerly of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Ramsey servedwith the 2nd Battalion of the Coldstream Guards in the First World War before hewas severely wounded in 1916. He blamed Jews for the manipulation of the SecondWorld War and he did not hide that fact. My feeling is that to blame any onerace for anything is extremely simplistic and can quite wrongly give theimpression that all Jews are responsible. This is fundamentally not the case. Ibelieve Jewish people as a whole are victims of the Global Elite, not behind it.But that some people who are Jewish are involved is without question. Why is itapparently terrible to say that when it is OK to say that some Arabs or Germansare involved, which they are? People are people are people. Or they should be. Idon’t care what bodies they have. It is what they do that interests me.Ramsey made some very legitimate points about the covert manoeuvrings and heasked some very pertinent questions in the House of Commons, while most of theother MPs were, as usual, easy prey for the manipulation. In a statement fromBrixton Prison to the Speaker and members of the House of Commons, Ramseyclaimed to have uncovered nearly thirty organisations which were working inBritain to bring about what I call the Elite agenda. The names thatinterconnected and controlled these organisations were, according to Ramsey:Professor Harold J. Laski (Fabian Society and Labour Party), Israel Moses Sieff,Professor Herman Levy, Victor Gollancz, D.N. Pritt MP, and G.R. Strauss MP.Notably, given what would later unfold as the European Community, he said hisinvestigations had unearthed a plot to bring about a Federal Europe. That hascertainly proved to be correct. He said in February 1940 he was handed someliterature about a new group advocating a Federal Europe under centralisedcontrol. “The list of supporters’ names was startling” he said. “It might havebeen copied from the chart I had just completed.” This chart was theinterconnecting names and organisations he said were engineering the war, someof whom are listed above.17 Ramsey raised these matters in a question in theHouse of Commons. He asked for confirmation that the creation of a Federal Unionof Europe was not one of the war aims of the government, but he received only anoncommittal reply. Ramsey had, in fact, identified one of the key reasons forthe war, as we shall see.His most potent threat to the manipulators came from his connections with TylerKent, an American coding officer employed at the US Embassy in London, whereJoseph Kennedy (the father of JFK) was the ambassador. Kennedy was later to saythat he opposed the war because it had been manipulated to happen. More aboutthis in Chapter 12 [../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos965525]. Kent had sentcoded cables between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt beforeChurchill became Prime Minister. They were both knowingly part of the scam.Churchill was then the First Lord of the Admiralty. The contents of the cablesconfirmed that the war was indeed a setup, with Churchill and Roosevelt plottingtogether to arrange future events. They also showed that the manipulation of thewar in Europe was being coordinated from New York.Ramsey saw some of these documents at Kent’s flat at 47 Gloucester Place. Heintended to see the rest and make the contents known to Chamberlain after avisit to Scotland. While he was away, Chamberlain was replaced by Churchill andwhen Ramsey returned to London, he was arrested on the steps of his house underRegulation 18b. He spent the rest of the war in jail and so did Tyler Kent, whowas found guilty of stealing documents from the US Embassy.18 Ambassador JosephKennedy sacked Kent just before he was arrested by the British authorities andthis deprived him of diplomatic immunity from prosecution in the British courts.He was tried in secret in ways that were illegal under the AmericanConstitution. Kent and Ramsey were jailed in Britain for the duration of thewar, along with another investigator, Anna Wookoff, to prevent them revealingthe truth about the war and how it started. Part of Kent’s defence against thecharges was that Roosevelt was helping to remove Chamberlain and installChurchill, and that this was part of a chain of events designed to bring Americainto the war.In the USA and the UK, the wartime leaders, Roosevelt and Churchill, are stillrevered as wartime heroes, and yet the legends and reality are light yearsapart. Even the conventional ‘history’ which says that Churchill broadcast liveto the nation on the BBC to lift morale (with lines like “We will fight them onthe beaches”), is a fantasy. Churchill’s speeches were never broadcast live orin their entirety by the BBC. He made them in the House of Commons and shortrecorded clips were later used in the news bulletins. After the war, it was anactor who recorded his speeches in full for the Decca record company.19With Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler all in place, the Elite could step up thewar and turn it into a worldwide conflict. It would be a massive global problemin search of a massive global solution: the United Nations, the EuropeanCommunity, and all the other centralised institutions that would appear after1945. According to Roosevelt’s son, Colonel Elliot Roosevelt, his father usedthe cover of an invented fishing trip in August 1941 to meet Churchill on boarda warship in Argentia Bay. Also at the meeting were Lord Beaverbrook (the ownerof the London Daily Express) and Averell Harriman (whose family business hadfinanced the Bolshevik Revolution, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi war machine, andeugenics organisations advocating the forced sterilisation of the ‘lowerclasses’ to bring about a Master Race). These were the people who met to discussopposition to Hitler! Churchill, Beaverbrook and Harriman were all members ofthe Committee of 300.Harriman was close to both Roosevelt and Churchill and he acted as thego-between, advising both of them. From this position, he could manipulate thetwo leaders as he liked, or rather, as the Global Elite liked. The Elite’sproblem was to bounce the American people into sending their sons and daughtersinto another war in Europe which, on the face of it, had nothing to do withthem. The American people were so keen to avoid war that Roosevelt could onlyget re-elected by saying he had no intention of sending their children to fightin Europe or anywhere else, thus echoing the words of Woodrow Wilson before hetook America into the First World War. Like Wilson, Roosevelt was lying. Look atsome of the things he said:> “…And while I am talking to you mothers and fathers, I give you one more> assurance. I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and> again. Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.”20> “You can therefore nail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate> untruth.”21All the time he was saying these things, he knew the Second World War was beingexecuted by the Elite and that the means to make American public opinion acceptUS involvement had long been unfolding behind the scenes. Roosevelt was breakingthe international laws on neutrality and defying his own speeches by supplyingthe British with ammunition and weapons both covertly and through the Lend LeaseAct. Some members of Congress could see what was happening. RepresentativePhilip Bennett of Missouri said:> “But our boys are not going to be sent abroad, says the President. Nonsense,> Mr Chairman; even now their berths are being built in our transport ships.> Even now the tags for identification of the dead and wounded are being printed> by the firm of William C. Ballantyne and Co of Washington.”22To this day, popular accounts of history portray Roosevelt as a man who “strovein vain to ward off war”.23 The Elite plan, long known by Roosevelt, was toengineer an attack on the United States which would so anger public opinion thatpeople would agree to go to war against the aggressor and, as a consequence ofthat, join the European conflict also. As a member of Woodrow Wilson’sadministration in the First World War, Roosevelt would have been well-schooledin manipulating public opinion with engineered events. In 1939, Senator P. Nyeof North Dakota said that he had seen a series of volumes called The Next War,including one called Propaganda In The Next War. This was the document to whichI referred some chapters earlier. It revealed that the Americans had beenpromised that Britain would recognise a Jewish homeland in Palestine if theAmericans entered the First World War. As Senator Nye revealed, the materialalso included the game plan for manipulating public opinion into acceptingAmerican intervention in the second global conflict, which these documents –written between the wars – said was coming. The propaganda document, whichoriginated in Britain, said:> “To persuade her [the United States] to take our part will be much more> difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite> threat to America, a threat moreover, which will have to be brought home by> propaganda to every citizen, before the Republic will again take arms in an> external quarrel…> “The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan [my emphasis] were> involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without further> ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious effect of our> propagandists to achieve this, just as in the Great War they succeeded in> embroiling the United States with Germany…> “Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be> entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must> clearly enunciate our belief in the democratic form of government, and our> firm resolve to adhere to… the old goddess of democracy routine.”24The manipulation around Roosevelt was coordinated by Bernard Baruch and thatfront for the Global Elite, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Baruch waschairman of the War Industries Board during World War I and was among the‘advisors’ who negotiated the German reparations at Versailles. He was the voicein Roosevelt’s ear, as he had been for many presidents. The Council on ForeignRelations devised the plan to antagonise Japan to such a degree that they wouldattack the United States. At the forefront of this was Roosevelt’s Secretary ofWar, Henry Stimson, a founder of the CFR. In his diary he wrote: “We face thedelicate question of diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure Japan is putinto the wrong and makes the first bad overt move”.25 The CFR’s War and PeaceStudies Project sent a memo to Roosevelt, suggesting that aid be given to Chinawhile she was in conflict with Japan, and that Japanese assets in the US befrozen, a trade embargo imposed, and Japan be refused access to the PanamaCanal. I can recommend an excellent book, Pearl Harbor, The Story Of The SecretWar,26 by George Morgenstern, which sets out in great detail how the Japanesewere goaded into the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7th 1941. Forfour years before the attack, the Roosevelt administration had been interceptingand decoding secret Japanese messages. They knew that the Japanese intended toalert their diplomatic centres around the world of a decision to go to warthrough a false weather report during the daily Japanese language short-wavenews broadcast. The forecast of ‘east wind rain’ indicated war with the UnitedStates, ‘west wind clear’ would mean a decision to go to war with Britain andBritish and Dutch colonies in the East, while ‘north wind cloudy’ meant war withRussia.As a congressional investigation27 heard in 1945, the messages indicating adecision to go to war with the United States and Britain, though not withRussia, were intercepted and decoded on December 3rd 1941 – four days beforePearl Harbor. These messages subsequently went ‘missing’ from Navy files. Otherdecoded messages gave Roosevelt prior warning of the attack on Pearl Harbor, butthe people were not told. On January 27th 1941, the US ambassador in Tokyo,Joseph Grew, had written to Roosevelt to say that in the event of war, PearlHarbor would be the first target.28 In all, Roosevelt had information from eightdifferent sources indicating a probable attack.29 The attack was to happenpurely to manipulate American public opinion into agreeing to go into anotherwar, which had been long planned. And no-one was more duped than the Japanese.They had been tricked into attacking the US, both by the Americans and theGermans. The German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, had been pressingthe Japanese to attack the United States. On December 6th, Hitler had added tothe Japanese resolve by indicating that the German forces were about to enterMoscow. On December 8th, the day after Pearl Harbor, the Germans were found tobe in retreat from the Russian front. Three thousand people were killed at PearlHarbor, the latest victims in the Elite’s plan to control the world, but most ofthe cream of the US Navy was out of harbour at the time. Surprised? The dayafter Pearl Harbor, Allen Dulles was appointed to the staff of the Office of theCoordinator of Information, which later became the Office of Strategic Services(OSS) and then the CIA.The plan worked brilliantly, as public opinion reacted in exactly the wayrequired. America was into another war in Europe and ‘our boys’ who were notgoing to be sent to Europe (according to Roosevelt) were now on their way, manyof them to die. Churchill’s reaction to the news was: “That is what I havedreamed of, aimed at, and worked for, and now it has come to pass”.30 He mighthave added, “And I always knew it was going to”. The Round Table/Royal Instituteof International Affairs were perfectly placed to coordinate the manipulation inthe United States. Lord Lothian, who campaigned for the appeasement of Hitlerand then demanded war, was named British Ambassador to the United States. Whenhe died in December 1940, he was replaced in Washington by another elite memberof the Round Table/RIIA, Lord Halifax (Comm 300). This was the man, you willrecall, who suggested a deal with Hitler when they met in 1938. Apart from theBritish Embassy in Washington, the Round Table had its members in control of theResearch and Intelligence Department of the UK Foreign Office, the Ministry ofInformation, and all the agencies involved with economic ‘mobilisation andreconstruction’.31 A similar situation prevailed in the US. The influence onRoosevelt of the Council on Foreign Relations, with its membership throughoutthe government, banking, commerce, media, and military, cannot be overestimated.Roosevelt’s son-in-law, Curtis Dall, quoted in Jim Keith’s Casebook OnAlternative 3, said:> “For a long time I felt that [Roosevelt]…had developed many thoughts and ideas> that were his own to benefit this country, the USA. But he didn’t. Most of his> thoughts, his political ‘ammunition’ as it were, were carefully manufactured> for him in advance by the Council on Foreign Relations/One World Money Group.> Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded> that prepared ‘ammunition’ in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the> American people – and thus paid off and retained his internationalist> political support.” (p25)Dall also revealed that Roosevelt had ignored a German offer of an “honourablesurrender” in the spring of 1943. The offer was made to Commander George Earle,Roosevelt’s personal military attaché in Istanbul, by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,the head of the German secret service, and later repeated by Fritz Von Papen,the German Ambassador. All the messages which Earle sent to Roosevelt detailingthe offer of surrender were ignored.32 The manipulators wanted the war tocontinue until the world was changed in their image.Symbolically, the Roosevelt mansion (on East 65th Street in New York) was nextdoor to the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations! While hell wasbeing visited upon this planet for a second time in twenty-five years, the Elitewere right on course. As in the First War, the idea was to win the peace once itwas all over, and to leave the world at the end of the war in a situation thatcould be most effectively controlled. Hitler didn’t invade Britain when it wasthere for the taking (after the Dunkirk retreat of 1940) because, I amincreasingly convinced, those who were controlling him did not want that tohappen. And, as became clear after the war, the Allied Supreme Commander,General Eisenhower, was prevented by Roosevelt (the Global Elite) from moving onthrough Germany when the Germans were overrun, so that the Soviet Union Empirecould be extended to Berlin and the Cold War thus created. Eisenhower was aclose associate of the Rockefellers and Bernard Baruch. Thanks to them hisprogress through the ranks was astonishingly fast. After the war he becamePresident of the United States. On April 9th 1951, Life magazine reported thatEisenhower had radioed Stalin via the US military mission in Moscow, to detailhis plan to stop at the Elbe River and allow the Russians to take Berlin. Themessage was written by his political advisor, John Wheeler Bennett of the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs, received by W. Averell Harriman, and passedon to Stalin.33 The Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall were Elite creations on theclassic principle of divide and rule and manipulate through fear. World war as aform of control was going to be replaced, at least for a few decades, by thefear of apocalyptic conflict between East and West. This fear was fuelled by theunveiling of a new and devastating weapon, the atomic bomb. It was created bythe Americans under the so called ‘Manhattan Project’, led by RobertOppenheimer, with support from the Elite-controlled Institute for Advanced Studyat Princeton University (where Albert Einstein was a regular visitor).After Roosevelt’s death,34 his successor, another Freemason, Harry S. Truman,authorised the use of this ‘new’ weapon to destroy the Japanese cities ofHiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th 1945. Eighty thousand men, women,and children were killed by the explosion at Hiroshima alone. Goodness knows howmany have died or suffered since from the effects of the radiation. Thisgrotesque act of inhumanity was justified by the politicians and militaryleaders as the only way to protect American lives which, it was said, would havebeen lost in enormous numbers had an invasion of Japan been authorised. We nowknow different. We now know that the Japanese had agreed to surrender theprevious spring on the same terms that were accepted after the bombs weredropped. Emperor Hirohito agreed to this through secret negotiations with the USvia the Vatican. The former British cabinet minister, Tony Benn, has said thathe learned that this was the case when he entered government. Retired ColonelDonn Grand Pre, writing in the American investigative newspaper, The Spotlight,on September 12th 1994, said that he also knew for sure that the Japanese wouldhave surrendered before Hiroshima. He said that in May 1945 he was with amilitary force, driving what was left of the Japanese army out of North Burmawhile B-29s were devastating Tokyo in a series of raids. Two days after thoseraids in the May, the Colonel said, the acting US Secretary of State, Joseph C.Grew, recommended to President Truman that he add to his terms for a Japanesesurrender the words… “surrender would not mean the elimination of the presentdynasty (Emperor Hirohito) if the Japanese desired its retention”. These werethe terms on which the Japanese would surrender after the horrors of threemonths later. Truman apparently favoured the addition, but after consulting withhis advisors, the idea was dropped for ‘military reasons’. It was a question oftiming, the dissenters said. Truman’s decision was to cost tens of thousands oflives, possibly hundreds of thousands. The ‘question of timing’ related to thePotsdam Conference when Truman, Churchill, and Josef Stalin would issue anultimatum to Japan – minus the suggested addition. As Colonel Donn Grand Pre nowsays:> “The psychological spin behind the exploding of the bombs was to create such a> worldwide fear of the power of nuclear energy that countries would give up> their sovereignty, turn all their weapons and armed forces over to a world> government and surrender their freedom.”35President Truman said in an address shortly before Hiroshima: “It will be justas easy for nations to get along in a republic of the world as it is for us toget along in the Republic of the United States”. This same approach ofjustifying centralised world government and all that goes with it can be seen inthe statements of Albert Einstein, the man remembered for his scientific geniusto such an extent that today you still hear very clever people described asbeing an ‘Einstein’. But there was more to him than that. Einstein, who arrivedin America from Germany via Switzerland, was a close friend of Bernard Baruch,the financier and string puller of presidents, and of Lord Victor Rothschild,the arch manipulator within British Intelligence who would gather atomicinformation for Israel’s secret nuclear weapons programme. Einstein worked onthe development of the atomic bomb and Baruch called it the ‘absolute weapon’.Baruch set himself up as the head of an organisation he called The UnitedNations Atomic Energy Commission in 1944 – sixteen months before the US Cabinet,including the then Vice President Truman, knew the bomb even existed and beforethe first meeting of the official founding group of the United Nations! But thenBaruch and his fellow manipulators had known since the First World War what wasplanned. When Truman became president and learned of the bomb and the UnitedNations became official, he appointed Baruch to head… the United Nations AtomicEnergy Commission. Both Baruch and Einstein sought to use the fear of atomicdestruction to install a world government. What a help it was to have an examplein Hiroshima and Nagasaki to emphasise its capacity for destruction! Einsteincalled for the formation of a world government by the United States, Britain andthe Soviet Union, to which the ‘secret of the bomb’ should be given. He saidthat these three were “the only three powers with great military strength” andhe urged them to commit this strength (world army) to the world government. The‘genius’ went on:> “The world government would have power over all military matters and need have> only one further power: the power to intervene in countries where a minority> is oppressing a majority and creating the kind of instability that leads to> war…There must be an end to the concept of non-intervention, for to end it is> part of keeping the peace.”36These mental gymnastics were right off the pages of the Elite personnel manualand these themes are being parroted to this day by those seeking to turn theUnited Nations ‘peacekeeping’ forces into an Einstein-like world army. Just lookat Bosnia. Under Einstein’s criteria of a minority oppressing a majority, thefirst intervention by the world government and army should have been in theSoviet Union which he said should be part of the world government and army! But,no. The genius had an answer to that:> “While it is true that in the Soviet Union the minority rules, I do not> consider the internal conditions there are of themselves a threat to world> peace. One must bear in mind that the people of Russia did not have a long> political education and changes to improve Russian conditions had to be> carried through by a minority for the reason that there was no majority> capable of doing it.”37Decoded, this Einstein-speak is saying that what we need is to use the fear ofmass destruction to install a world (Elite) government which will have a worldarmy at its disposal to intervene whenever it believed its interests and powerwould benefit. In 1946, Einstein’s British friend, Bertrand Russell (Comm 300),said that it was necessary to use the fear of nuclear weapons to force allnations to give up their sovereignty and submit to the dictatorship of theUnited Nations.38 This was the approach decided upon in 1958 at the second ofthe Pugwash Conferences when the policy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) wasagreed. The conferences were hosted by Cyrus Eaton, a business partner of theRockefellers.39 In reality, the MAD policy involved building up nuclear arsenalson both sides to the point where for either to attack the other would meanannihilation for both of them. The fear of this would be used as a wonderfulmeans of controlling government policy, arms spending, and public opinionthroughout the Cold War, while at the top levels of manipulation they were allon the same side. Pavel A. Sudoplatov, head of the Soviet Intelligence Bureau onthe atomic problem during World War Two, has now confirmed that Oppenheimer wassupplying data about the bomb to the Soviet Union during the war.40 Klaus Fuchs,the German nuclear physicist, worked on the Manhattan Project after he ‘fled’from Germany to Britain in 1933. Fuchs, a close associate of Lord VictorRothschild (Comm 300), was later jailed for fourteen years for supplying Britishand American atomic secrets to the Russians. The post-war Pugwash Conferences,inspired by Einstein and Bertrand Russell, were another means through whichscientific data was passed from one side to the other during the alleged ‘ColdWar’. They also helped Victor Rothschild to amass nuclear information forIsrael, as we shall see later.It is hard to believe at first, but you don’t have to search too far to realisethat almost every major negative event of global significance has been part ofthe same long-term plan by the All-Seeing Eye cult to take over the planet via acentralised world government, central bank, currency, and army. And it is beingdone by programming the human mind. If we are going to stop this and allowhumanity to burst forth in its full potential for love and harmony, there is onething we need to do above all else. We have to stop thinking in black and whiteand soften our rigid belief systems. This world is not black and white. Nothingis. If you have a rigid belief system that is not open to the endless subtletiesof life, you become a manipulator’s party trick. If you believe that someonerunning a business in a pin-striped suit is bad by definition, without listeningto what the person has to say, your mind is not your own. The same with thosewho see the homeless or travellers and immediately react with ‘scroungers’ or‘dossers’. Or those who believe one race or other is inferior to their own.No-one is all right and no-one is all wrong.Because the thinking of the mass of the British people before and during WorldWar Two was so set and inflexible, it bought the idea of good v evil, when thesame force was behind both sides. It also allowed people who had the courage tostand up and speak out against the manipulation to be jailed without chargethroughout the war. If you challenge our side, you must be a supporter of theother side, this childlike mindset believed. This is the type of non-thinkingwhich allows the manipulation to go on. Still today, if you speak of the globaldeception and mention any name involved which happens to be Jewish, you areimmediately branded ‘anti-Semitic’. Some people do this purposely to discreditthe researcher and diminish the impact of their information. Others, like thepeople I call the Robot Radicals, parrot these slogans because their minds areso rigid at this time, that they couldn’t cope with the idea that many of their‘far Left’, ‘radical’, heroes, were controlled by the same force, sometimes partof the same force, which controls their perceived enemies on the ‘far Right’.It was this naïvety that allowed the World Wars to happen. For the second timein forty-five years both ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ had been manipulated into conflictwith the most devastating and horrific effect.

If you do that, no-one listens to theevidence because this is lost in the tidal wave of vilification andcondemnation. If people want to believe that all those who question the officialline are Nazis and apologists for the Hitler regime, or anti-Jewish, then theymust go ahead and do so. But I’ll tell them this. They are kidding themselves,because that isn’t true. It simply isn’t.As the old vibration of life begins to crumble and the new one emerges, we arein the period now when the muck of the past which has remained hidden is comingto the surface to be dealt with and dispersed. The content of this book is partof that. It is not only individuals who have suppressed emotions which eat themaway and eventually have to be dealt with, it is the Earth and the collectivemind of humanity also. The process of cleansing the Earth takes many forms, andone of them is for all that has been secret and suppressed to come into thepublic spotlight. Whether people like it or whether they don’t, the officialversion of The Holocaust cannot avoid this exposure to proper debate for verymuch longer. The process of cleansing and transformation will ensure that thiswill happen.The way the Nazis treated many Jewish people is unspeakable. There are no wordsadequate to describe it. The pain, as we see in the commemorations, appearsundiminished for those who lived through it. What an insult it would be to thosepeople who suffered so, if it were established that their pain and unimaginablehorror is also being used without their knowledge, to promote and protect alonger-term plan. It would qualify, perhaps, as one of the ultimateinhumanities. Are people who did not suffer under the Nazis using the emotionsof those who did to manipulate events for their own diabolical ends? We can onlyestablish if that is true by allowing all information about that period to bemade public without vilification or condemnation.As Professor Yehuda Bauer, the chairman of the Vidal Sassoon Centre for theStudy of Anti-Semitism, said, “Someone is misusing people’s fears and obsessionsand presenting things we know today did not happen”.1 He was reacting to storiesabout ‘human soap’ which holocaust ‘experts’ have said the Nazis made out of thebodies of Jewish victims in the concentration camps. This has become an accepted‘fact’, but Professor Bauer said there was no documentary evidence that any suchthing took place. In the researching of this book, for the first time in my lifeI stumbled across information which questions the official holocaust line. I wasshocked, to be honest. I looked at it and I wrote it down, a process that alwayshelps me to get things clearer in my mind. I pondered on it endlessly for weeks.My conclusion was that there were the most terrible atrocities against Jewishpeople, as there were against others in Germany, the Soviet Union, and inJapanese-occupied countries. The whole war was a holocaust. What the Europeansettlers did to the Native American tribes was a holocaust. The atrocities thatJewish people did suffer under the Nazis, makes the pain that we see thoroughlyunderstandable. But I also concluded from the evidence I came across that theofficial line has a vast number of questions to answer and enormous tracts ofdocumented information to explain before we can really know what happened. LikeI say, nothing is ever what it seems, no matter what we may be told. When, forinstance, a Jewish American like David Cole produces evidence and videodocumentaries demolishing the official claims about the events at Auschwitz, youcannot, if you are interested in truth, just dismiss his findings and condemnhim as a Nazi apologist. That is not to say that everything people say iscorrect, but why are we so frightened to allow the public to decide forthemselves? Why is such information suppressed?People might not like me making these points, but I ask them this: what is atrue love for humanity? Is it saying what you believe people need to know andtaking the flak? Or is it saying what you think they want to know and taking theplaudits?I come back to something that I see often in my research into the Global Elite:the way Jewish people are used as mere propaganda fodder by the upper reaches oftheir own hierarchy, especially the Rothschilds and others like the Habsburgs.Jewish people are not seeking to take over the world. The opposite is true. Theyjust want to get on peacefully and joyfully with their lives, like all of us.Instead, they are being used mercilessly by their own privileged, manipulatingcliques to be the ‘fall guy’, to protect the few from legitimate investigationand exposure. So much of their history is kept from them to ensure they remainunder the mental and emotional control of the few. Major Alojzy Dziurski, of thewartime Polish underground movement, was no apologist for the Nazis and nor washe anti-Jewish. He had a wide circle of Jewish friends and expressed a deepgratitude to the Jew he said had saved his life. In his book, Freedom Fighter,Dziurski told how he heard that the German attitude to Jews had changed quitedramatically after they realised the Zionist influence in Stalin’s Soviet Union.This prompted Major Dziurski to meet with Polish Jewish leaders in March 1942,to warn them that they must disperse the Jews living in the ghettos, move themto homes among Polish farmers in remote areas, and establish settlements inforested areas. He said the leaders refused, with terrible consequences. Themajor said he became a close friend of a Jewish captain, who had been aPolitical Commissar in the Red Army. Dziurski said in his book:> “Because of my interest in Jewish affairs, he [the Captain] would share with> me a well-guarded secret. Accepted as a devoted Zionist, he would attend a> secret meeting for initiated Zionists only. It was conducted in Hebrew, not in> Yiddish, as most meetings were. The majority of the speakers were foreign> Zionist leaders, but he recognised only one, Moshe Sneh, a Polish Jewish> leader, who had left for Palestine before the war and returned in 1945 as> Berihah leader to organise the mass emigration of Polish Jews. Every speaker> emphasised the unique opportunity that had come to snatch Palestine and the> Middle East from the Arabs and the British…The whole non-Jewish world had to> be made to feel guilty for The Holocaust together with the Nazis. The> Holocaust must be shown to be the greatest Christian crime against the Jewish> people. Intensive propaganda would be launched, and all publishing houses and> the press under Jewish influence had already been instructed to propagate the> story of Jewish sufferings.> “Moshe Sneh had demanded that the maximum number of Polish Jews must be forced> to leave Poland for Palestine or any country of their choice. Instructions had> been issued to Western European Jewry to prepare for the reception of Polish> immigrants…to filter later into the United States. The USA must be made the> great reservoir of Jewry to influence American politics because the USA would> become the decisive world power.”2You may or may not accept that. But you have a right to hear it, and much, much,more of the documented background information relating to this subject will becoming to the surface in the years to come. No-one will be more stunned by whatwill be made known than the mass of Jewish people themselves. They are going tolook on their hierarchy in a very different light. Major Dziurski compiled alarge number of writings and archives about his wartime experiences and theinformation given to him by Jewish friends and acquaintances. These were stolenin a robbery at his home in May 1965, after which he emigrated to Australia.I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass ofJewish people worked with non-Jews to create the First World War, the RussianRevolution, and the Second World War. This Jewish/non-Jewish Elite used theFirst World War to secure the Balfour Declaration and the principle of theJewish State of Israel in Palestine (for which, given the genetic history ofmost Jewish people, there is absolutely no justification on historical groundsor any other). They then dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and createdthe circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable. They financedHitler to power in 1933 and made the funds available for his rearmament. Theirrepresentatives in other nations manipulated their governments to allow Hitlerand the Nazis to invade surrounding countries and increase their military powerand potential by acquiring the resources of those countries. They gave Hitlerthe impression that he could expand across mainland Europe without challenge,but then, at a prearranged time, the attitude of Britain changed dramaticallyand he found himself in a war he could not win – especially after Rooseveltmanipulated the American people, via Pearl Harbor, into a conflict he said theywould never be involved in.Meanwhile, those Jews in Germany who were part of, or useful to, this tinyJewish/non-Jewish Elite were allowed to leave the Nazi-occupied lands and escapeto the USA, other safe countries, and to Palestine to begin the work that wouldculminate in the creation of Israel after the war. They were not the ones whowere to suffer so terribly under Hitler. Far from it. They were the ones whowere going to use and exploit the suffering of those left behind. When theprivileged elite, like the banker Max Warburg, had left Germany, the Jewish men,women, and children considered expendable in pursuit of a wider goal were leftto their fate. That fate was sealed when Alfred Rosenberg with his Jewishbackground, made a copy of The Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion availableto Hitler.So what could possibly motivate this manipulating Jewish clique to treat theirfellow Jews in such a subhuman way? Quite simply, the manipulators are notreally Jews, as Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman points out in his 1974 book, ToEliminate The Opiate. Antelman, who lost seventeen members of his family to theNazis, says that this clique does not want to promote Judaism, it wants todestroy it, as it wants to destroy all alternatives to its own focus of worship,the All-Seeing Eye cult of antiquity. It is this which provides the commonthemes of loyalty and motivation between the Jews, Arabs, British, Germans,Americans etc, who are knowingly working together to bring about the globalfascist tyranny known as the New World Order. The ‘Jews’ of the Global Elitecould not give a damn about Jewish people, as the Germans in the clique couldnot care less about the German people. To them, the masses of whatever race,colour, or country, are a herd of nonentities who are there to be used only asnecessary to serve their master – the Luciferic Consciousness on the FourthDimension. The ‘All Seeing’ Jews, however, and their non-Jewish conspirators,use the smokescreen of ‘anti-Semitism’ and the genuine suffering of real Jews toprevent investigation of their sinister activities. I am convinced that it wasthis clique which wrote and leaked the Protocols and made it look like a plot byJewish people as a whole. It is not. No, no, no!After the war, the unimaginable suffering of Jewish people, condemned by theirown elite, among others, was used to bring the State of Israel into being on awave of understandable emotion, given the stories the world was being told. Ithas been used ever since to block legitimate investigation into the manipulationof the human race. The label ‘anti-Semite’ is hurled at anyone who challengesthe official version of history and who exposes the people who really controlthe world. One vehicle for this Jewish and non-Jewish clique – which has madeJews suffer so much – is called Zionism and so is the State of Israel, a countryand a ruling mindset, which to me looks remarkably like the Nazi mentality.The British hierarchy has provably manipulated, exploited, and sent to theirdeaths multimillions of British people to serve the ‘national interest’ – theinterests of the ruling clique; the German hierarchy has done the same to theGerman people and the American hierarchy to the American population. Theseruling cliques have utter contempt for their ‘unwashed masses’. They see them ascattle to be used and abused as required. Why is it so amazing that the Jewishhierarchy should see the mass of Jewish people in the same terms?The exploitation of those who did suffer by those who didn’t has allowed theruling elite of Israel to commit the most terrible atrocities without challengefrom the wider world community, while any perceived threat to Israel isimmediately condemned and dealt with. Why do we not hear about the decades ofatrocities by Israel against the dispossessed Palestinians, which have beenreported again and again by members of the United Nations Relief and WorksAgency? The grotesque irony is that while complaining about the ‘far Right’ and‘anti-Semitism’, the Israeli government has supported Nazi regimes across theworld, including the terrorist, Somoza, who was responsible for the slaughter oftens of thousands of his own people in Nicaragua.3 Israel has armed or supportedneo-Nazis and terrorists in Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Central America, Argentina,and scores of others,4 in league with the neo-Nazis who control the UnitedStates and the CIA. When Israel pontificates about racism and the far Right, itturns my stomach. The Israeli government, its army and its intelligence arm,Mossad, are neo-Nazi, terrorist organisations. This mindset is personified bymany of the Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. TheIsraeli authorities hide this fact behind Jewish people who genuinely sufferedin Hitler’s Germany. The Israeli leaders who are part of, or controlled by, theAll-Seeing Eye cult, have used this suffering for more than fifty years toconceal and justify daily atrocities against the Arab population. Palestinianchildren are shot by Nazi settlers in the occupied lands, but the killers escapewithout punishment. Meanwhile, Arabs are routinely shot by the same soldiers wholook the other way when settlers are terrorising Palestinian men, women, andchildren.5 As Hitler treated those Jews cast adrift by their own hierarchy, sodoes Israel treat Palestinians today. I’ll take no lectures on racism and Nazismfrom apologists for Israeli terrorism, thank you very much.Indeed those who led the terrorist organisations which created Israel after thewar, later became its leaders. To challenge the behaviour of Israel is not tocondemn Jewish people. The opposite is the case. Those who have controlledIsrael and its international terrorist arm, Mossad, are not true Jews. They area bunch of unbalanced thugs who have used (abused) Jewish people for their ownhorrific ends. Israeli Prime Minister Menachim Begin was a leading light in theJewish terrorist underground organisation, Irgun, and as a result wasresponsible for untold murder and mayhem. He would later win the Nobel PeacePrize, as did Henry Kissinger. Another Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir,was a terrorist in the Jewish underground before becoming (appropriately, Iguess) the head of the Mossad assassination squad at the time of the murder ofJohn F. Kennedy. In a later chapter I link both Shamir and Begin to Kennedy’sassassination. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was lauded as a great peace makerafter his own assassination in 1995, but he too was a terrorist. As NaeimGiladi, the Israeli historian and author, says: “Rabin launched his career…withterrorist murders that shed both Arab and Jewish blood when cold politicalcalculation demanded it”.6In 1940 when illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine became a flood, the Britishmilitary government began to detain and deport those Jews who did not have thecorrect documentation. The Zionist underground decided to sabotage the refugeeships rather than allow them to be turned away. Giladi goes on: “In those daysRabin was a member of Palmach – the name means ‘action squads’ – it was aviolent underground force…in November 1940 his group blew up the refugee shipPatria in Haifa harbour. More than 250 Jewish emigrants died in the explosion”.7Three other ships were later given the same treatment by Rabin’s Palmach andmore than a thousand Jews died as a result. But it was the Arabs who were blamedfor this barbarity and that was the whole point of the carnage, of course. TheZionist leader, David Ben-Gurion, wrote in his diary that the bombings “stirredmore world wide sympathy and support for us than we anticipated”.8 Later I willalso connect Ben-Gurion to the Kennedy assassination. I am coming more and moreto the conclusion that what happened to Jews in Nazi Germany (whatever the truthturns out to be) was supported, even planned, by these crazy people to ensurethat both Israel was created and that ‘anti-Semitism’ could be used as a defenceagainst legitimate investigation of their sickening activities. That hascertainly been the outcome. Anyone who exposes these breathtaking horrors isdubbed a neo-Nazi.What’s more, a lot of the money and the armaments used both by these undergroundterrorists and the founders of Israel were supplied by the Meyer Lanskyorganised crime syndicate which was based in the US, but operatedinternationally. Lansky, who was born Maier Suchowjansky in Grodno, Russia, rosefrom the slums of New York to the top of the heap in the internationalunderworld. He was above the Mafia. Lansky acheived these dizzy heights by theusual means – murder and terror. This was the man who used his crime and terrornetworks to channel funds and guns to the Jewish terrorists and the laterIsraeli State. Such was his contribution that he has been described as “Israel’sGodfather”.9 Lansky would run to Israel whenever the heat was turned up in theStates and eventually settled in his beloved “homeland”. Lansky, too, was at theheart of the murder of John F. Kennedy, as we shall see. These are the sorts ofminds that created Israel under the supervision of the Rothschilds. And yet ifyou challenge and expose these people, you are called a Nazi! Give me strength.Some brave Jews have spoken out against the behaviour of Israel and the plightof the Palestinians, people like Noam Chomsky and Israel Shahak10 (a survivor ofthe Belsen concentration camp), but where are the British government and theUnited States government? Silence. These are legitimate points in a democracy(hilarious, I know), but people are frightened, even terrified, to make them,because they will be branded ‘anti-Semitic’. Even some Jews who have made thesepoints have been branded ‘anti-Semitic’! To this day, the clique continues toarrange for ‘anti-Semitic’ events and attacks which allow this manipulation ofthe Jewish and non-Jewish communities to go on. The Jewish hierarchy wishes tokeep the mass of Jewish people in constant fear, a state of mind which makesanyone child’s play to control and manipulate. The far Right are a dream forthis clique and they play into their hands by behaving in ways that make themanipulation so much easier. Not all of them are behaving in this way byaccident, either. Who actually funds some of these ‘far Right’ groups? If youknow, perhaps you’ll tell me.In Britain, I am told by an extremely reliable source very close to theintelligence organisations that the ‘far Right’ group, Combat 18, is a front forthe sinister Anti-Defamation League, the United States arm of the‘Israeli’/Rothschild secret service, Mossad. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)has been operating in Britain and Europe since at least 1991 and its role is tobrand as anti-Semitic anyone who is getting close to the truth of what is goingon. What better way to discredit an investigator than to have a ‘far Right’group like Combat 18 to praise them? What better way to control Jewish peoplethrough fear than to have the behaviour of Combat 18 as an example of what iswaiting for them if they don’t have the hierachy to protect them?If you find all this hard to believe there are many examples that prove thepoint. At the time of the Kennedy assassination the national secretary of theAmerican Nazi Party was a man called Daniel Burros. He was a close associate ofthe “Nazi” Roy Frankhouser, a man who once said: “Hitler had the Jews; we’ve gotthe niggers. We have to put our main stress on the nigger question, of course,because that’s what preoccupies the masses – but we’re not forgetting the Jew.If Jews knew what was coming – and believe me, it’s coming as surely as the dawn– they’d realise that what’s going to happen in America will make Nazi Germanylook like a Sunday-school picnic. We’ll build better gas chambers, and more ofthem, and this time there won’t be any refugees”.11 Charming. But “Nazi”Frankhouser turned out to be a professional federal infiltrator of the Ku KluxKlan and other “Nazi” and “Communist” organisations. His close associate, the“Nazi” Daniel Burros, was exposed in October 1965 as a Jew by the New YorkTimes. The following day he was found shot dead at Frankhouser’s home inReading, Pennsylvania. Verdict “suicide”. Burros was also a key figure in the“Nazi” National Renaissance Party, which was controlled by the Anti-DefamationLeague. Life is never what it seems. The ‘opponent’ of Combat 18 in the UK is anorganisation called Searchlight. The same source tells me that this is a frontfor the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the ADL. Can anyone confirm this?It is an old, old strategy. Even Mossad is not what it appears to be. It isactually the intelligence agency primarily for the Rothschilds, the bankingcartel of the Global Elite, and the cult of the All-Seeing Eye, as is the ADL.Researcher Gary Allen put the situation very well in his 1973 book, None DareCall It Conspiracy:> “One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the international> bankers in political history is that the Rothschilds were Jewish. [Anti-Jewish> people]…have played into the hands of the conspiracy by trying to portray the> entire conspiracy as Jewish. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The> traditionally Anglo Saxon J.P. Morgan and Rockefeller international banking> institutions have played a key role in the conspiracy. But there is no denying> the importance of the Rothschilds and their satellites. However, it is just as> unreasonable and immoral to blame all Jews for the crimes of the Rothschilds> as it is to hold all Baptists accountable for the crimes of the Rockefellers.> “The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The> Anti-Defamation League as an instrument to try to convince everyone that any> mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this> way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers> and made the subject taboo within universities.> “Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by> hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the> truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs… Actually,> nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow> Jews. The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolf> Hitler…”Tyranny has many forms and most of them are less than obvious. Widespreadcondemnation of Jews in Germany was the result of the Nazis putting out oneversion of the ‘truth’ (Jews are horrid) while suppressing alternativeinformation which told another story (Jews are no different from anyone else).That is clearly a mind-manipulating tyranny because people were denied all thefacts and views available and their attitudes were subsequently imbalanced. Butif that is a tyranny which we rightly pledge ourselves to oppose, why do we playa part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the SecondWorld War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, freecopies of the Spielberg film, Schindler’s List, are given to schools toindoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events? And why do we,who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go toprison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, forsuggesting another version of history? How can we not be accused of hypocrisyand of criticising one tyranny while supporting another? Once people think it isOK to suppress different views and evidence, whether we agree with it or not, weare playing God for the rest of our fellow men and women. If the evidence iswrong, then it will be shown to be so under the spotlight of the public arena.If it is true, then what the hell are we doing suppressing it? John F. Kennedysupported this view in a speech at Columbia University in February 1962, when hesaid:> “We seek the free flow of information…a nation that is afraid to let the> people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation afraid of> its people.”We live in nations afraid of the people and in a world afraid of the people. Wecling to dogmas that are afraid of the people. Those who wish to suppress bywhatever means alternative versions of history which challenge ‘the officialline’ are also afraid of the people – afraid that their manipulation will beexposed by such a free flow of information. The way the Jewish mind has been soseriously manipulated by the Jewish hierarchy over the centuries has had anothereffect. Like the Roman Catholic Church and other religious and racial tyrannies,Judaism, and more recently Zionism, has used fear and guilt to maintain controlof its people. It has pressurised each generation to conform to what it tellsthem they must believe and it has programmed their minds to think of themselvesas a people who have always been, and will always be, the subject of oppressionand prejudice from the rest of society. A leaflet12 asking for financial supportfor The Board of Deputies of British Jews has a picture of hostile neo-Nazis onthe front. Inside the leaflet it says that the Board is the Jewish community’s“protection” against racism and “Holocaust denial” at a time when “the voices offascists are getting louder”. It’s all fear, fear, fear, control, control,control. Many Jewish people have also been programmed to see themselves as God’s‘chosen people’, above all the rest, and when you read some of the Jewishliterature and laws, they are incredibly racist, quite stunningly so. TheTalmud, the Jewish book of law, contains among other little gems, the following:“Just the Jews are humans, the non-Jews are no humans, but cattle” (Kerithuth6b, page 78, Jebhammoth 61); “The non-Jews have been created to serve the Jewsas Slaves” (Midrasch Talpioth 225); “Sexual intercourse with non-Jews is likesexual intercourse with animals” (Kethuboth 3b); “The non-Jews have to beavoided, even more than sick pigs” (Orach Chaiim 57, 6a); “The birth rate ofnon-Jews has to be suppressed massively” (Zohar II, 4b); “As you replace lostcows and donkeys, so you shall replace non-Jews” (Lore Dea 377,1). And so itgoes on and on. So how often do the “anti-racist” protestors demonstrate outsideTalmudic events? Never. Exactly.The irony is that the racism of extreme Jews and the racism of Adolf Hitler areboth based on a colossal myth. As Alfred M. Lilienthal, the Jewish writer andresearcher, said:> “There is no reputable anthropologist who will not agree that Jewish racialism> is as much poppycock as Aryan racialism. As far back as 1938, the American> Anthropological Association, at it’s annual conference in New York, condemned> Aryanism as a fallacy and stated that both ‘Aryan’ and ‘Semitic’ were> linguistic terms without any racial significance…> “…Anthropological science divides mankind into three recognised races: negro,> mongolian and oriental, and caucasian or white (although some authorities> refer to a fourth race – the australoids)…Members of the Jewish faith are> found in all three races and subdivisions.”13The conditioned thought patterns in the collective Jewish mind have repeatedlycreated the physical reality of oppression, prejudice, and racism which matchesthe pattern – the expectation – programmed into their collective psyche. Theyexpect it; they create it. When Jewish people as a whole break free from themind control of their hierarchy and start to let go of those feelings of fearand expectation of prejudice, they will stop attracting such experiences tothem. When they openly reject the inherited view of racial superiority, thosepatterns will disperse from their magnetic cape/aura, and they will cease toattract racism to them. Also, like those brought up in the extreme versions ofRoman Catholicism, Jewish people need to love themselves and leave behind theguilt their controllers demand that they retain. Of all the people I meet, thosebrought up in the Roman Catholic and Jewish faith are among the most screwed-up,mentally and emotionally. This is no coincidence. Both faiths brainwash childrenwith fear and guilt from the earliest age.Jewish people are simply wonderful when they allow themselves to be who theyreally are. I love their humour and their spirit. They have such a contributionto make to the good of the world. But I have rarely met one who really lovesthemself or does not carry the burden of inherited guilt. My friends, it is allabout control. It’s time to let it go.Jewish people (who, like the rest of us, are evolving consciousnesses whichhappen to be experiencing a Jewish lifetime), will never be free until they stepout of the mental and emotional control of this tiny clique, which uses them inthe most merciless ways to advance its own sick and diabolical ambitions, inleague with an equally sick clique of non-Jews.Official history has been tampered with in the most extraordinary way, so thatwe continue to see the world in the childlike simplicity of good and evil,heroes and villains. It is rarely like that. After the war, the Nuremberg Trialssat in judgement on the Germans. When you look behind the sanitised historybooks you see that those trials were a farce, a calculated exercise in revengeand manipulation, often punishing those without influence to cover the tracks ofthose who had it…like the Americans on the boards of the US-Nazi cartels andparent companies. These were show trials of those Nazis not considered importantenough or with enough political and scientific knowledge, to be removed to theUnited States and South America where they could continue their work for theElite.14 The defence of following orders from a superior officer was not allowedat Nuremberg. This meant that if they had disobeyed an order during the war theywere shot, and if they obeyed the order they were hanged at Nuremberg. Theprecedent for removing the defence of following orders was made by the WarOffice in London in April 1944, just as the list of Nazi war criminals was beingcompiled and the preparations made for the post-war ‘trials’. At that time thewording of Paragraph 443 of Chapter XIV of The British Manual Of Military Lawwas changed to reflect the wording of an article written in The British YearBook Of International Law For 1944 by Dr Hersch Lauterpacht. The revisedParagraph 443 reads as follows:> “The clearly illegal nature of the order – illegal by reference to generally> acknowledged principles of international law so identified with cogent> dictates of humanity as to be obvious to any person of ordinary understanding> – renders the fact of superior orders irrelevant.”Dr Lauterpacht was a former Austrian with an interesting background. He was anassistant lecturer at the Round Table-influenced London School of Economicsbetween the wars. Then, in 1940, he became a visiting professor at theElite-controlled Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which was shown tobe promoting war. After his words were used to destroy the defence of superiororders, Dr Lauterpacht was appointed to the British War Crimes Executive and toa stream of international law publications and positions, including the UnitedNations International Law Commission.15 His son, Elihu Lauterpacht QC, wasconsultant to the UK government’s Central Policy Review Staff during thePremiership of Edward Heath (Conservative) and Jim Callaghan (Labour), and ahost of international law bodies.16 The head of Heath’s policy unit was LordVictor Rothschild.Nuremberg was an insult to natural justice. It doesn’t matter what thedefendants were supposed to have done. If people don’t administer justicefairly, they cannot claim to be any better than those they condemn. The Americanjudge, Justice Wenersturm, the president of one of the tribunals, resigned andwent home in disgust at the injustice and manipulation of it all. AnotherAmerican judge, Edward L. van Roden, was one of the three members of the SimpsonArmy Commission which was appointed to investigate the methods used at theDachau trials at Nuremberg. His findings were reported in the Washington DailyNews and the British Sunday Pictorial in January 1949. He described the waysthat ‘confessions’ were secured:> “Posturing as priests to hear confessions and give absolution; torture with> burning matches driven under the prisoner’s finger nails; knocking out of> teeth and breaking jaws; solitary confinement and near-starvation rations;…The> statements which were admitted as evidence were obtained from men who had> first been kept in solitary confinement for three, four, and five months…The> investigators would put black hoods over the accused’s head and then punch him> in the face with brass knuckles, kick him and beat him with rubber hoses…All> but two of the Germans, in the 139 cases we investigated, had been kicked in> the testicles beyond repair. This was standard operating procedure with our> American investigators…Strong men were reduced to broken wrecks ready to> mumble any admission demanded by their prosecutors.”These were the people sitting in judgement of others for their war crimes. Onceyou fall for the trick of seeing two sides as ‘good’ and ‘evil’ with no shadesof grey in between, you become a robot. Life is not like a John Wayne film.Shortly after the Falklands War in 1982, a soldier who served there told me howhe had been devastated to see his fellow British soldiers bayonetting to deathArgentine prisoners of war who had put down their weapons and surrendered. Hedescribed how other British ‘heroes’ cut off the fingers of dead Argentines tosteal their rings. He was so appalled, he left the forces in disgust. Yearslater, evidence came to light about these very events which led to a policeinvestigation, but their findings were ignored and the British governmentrefused to press charges against those involved. The newspapers said what anoutrage it would have been to charge ‘our boys’ with such offences when theywere ‘only fighting for their country’. It is about time we realised that someof ‘our boys’ act just as horribly as those in Germany and Iraq. Mind you, thatwould explode the nonsense we are supposed to accept that Britain, America, andthe West in general are on white chargers, ‘fighting for freedom’ to the soundof angelic choirs.Perhaps nothing demolishes this simplistic idea of ‘free’ world v tyranny morethan Hitler’s genetic experiments in pursuit of a Master Race. Ask most peopleabout the master race mentality and they will point to Adolf Hitler and theNazis. But again, it is not as simple as that. The plan for a master race andthe elimination of ‘lesser’ races did not begin and end in Nazi Germany. Itbegan long before and it is still going on. All that happened under Hitler wasthat he had such a grip on the country and the German mind that he could openlypromote it. This master race mentality is another part of the Elite’s plan forthe New World Order. When you think that the Prison Warders are seriously intogenetic engineering of the most advanced kind, it is hardly surprising thattheir stooges on Earth would reflect that in their own attitude of mind. TheNazis were doing and saying publicly what the Elite in Britain and America hadbeen saying and funding long before the word Nazi was even heard of.Eugenics is, to quote the Oxford Concise Dictionary, “…the production of fineoffspring by the improvement of inherited qualities”. The term eugenics wascoined by the Englishman, Francis Galton, in the later years of the nineteenthcentury. He called for society to intervene to maintain racial purity. Galtonwanted the forced sterilisation of the ‘unfit’. Another ‘pioneer’ of thismindset was Thomas Robert Malthus, born in 1766. It was from him that the theoryof the ‘survival of the fittest’ was passed on through Herbert Spencer toCharles Darwin. Malthus was obsessed with the culling of the population andproposed a series of measures against the ‘lower races’ (the poor), to keep thepopulation down and, as he saw it, to prevent the human genetic stream beingdominated by such ‘inferior’ racial lines. In his best known work, Essay, hesuggested that streets should be made narrower and more people crowded intohouses, to encourage the return of the plague. Villages should be built next tostagnant pools and, above all, remedies for preventing and curing disease oughtto be strongly condemned, he said. Malthus went on:> “We are bound in justice and honour formally to disclaim the right of the poor> to support. To this end, I should propose a regulation be made declaring that> no child born…should ever be entitled to parish assistance…The [illegitimate]> infant is comparatively speaking, of little value to society, as others will> immediately supply its place…All children beyond what would be required to> keep up the population to this [desired] level, must necessarily perish,> unless room be made for them by the deaths of grown persons.”17From such a mind did the idea of the ‘survival of the fittest’ emerge, and ithas dominated ‘science’ ever since! Add to this the belief that the intellect ofa person is genetically determined by the intellect of the parents and you havethe eugenics movement, which came to the surface so infamously under the rule ofAdolf Hitler. Although advanced esoteric knowledge is known at the top level ofthe Elite, some of those lower down on the pyramid are encouraged to believesome incredible garbage. Genetic superiority of the intellect throughinterbreeding is one of them. It appeals to the ego, I guess. Note, also, howthe Malthus proposals of the encouragement of disease and of forcing upon thepoor conditions they are unlikely to survive, are still at the forefront ofElite policy in the Third World and within industrialised countries, too.Names now familiar to us in this book, such as the Harrimans and theRockefellers, were seriously into eugenics. Averell Harriman’s mother funded thelaunch of the race-science movement in America in 1910, and built the EugenicsRecord Office as a branch of the Galton National Laboratory in London. TheHarrimans were responsible for the Bush family fortune and they were close toanother Bush family backer, George Herbert Walker (a relative by marriage ofPrescott Bush and grandfather to George Bush, who would go on to be President ofthe United States). By the late nineteenth century, some mentally ill people andchildren were being sterilised by US health officials as a result of eugenicspolicies. The State of Indiana made the sterilisation of the mentally ill and‘undesirables’ compulsory and 475 men were sterilised at the Indiana StateReformatory.After the turn of the century, the Harrimans and Rockefellers spent more than$11 million to establish a eugenics research laboratory at Cold Springs Harboron Long Island, New York, close to the Dulles brothers’ estates. The study ofeugenics was encouraged at the Elite-controlled universities, such as Harvard,Columbia, and Cornell. In Germany, the same line was taken by Ernst Haeckel, themystic and Aryan master race promoter, whose ideas would influence Hitler.Haeckel said it was the duty of a nation to enforce breeding, and he and hissupporters formed the Monist League to promote their sick beliefs in Germany.The first International Congress of Eugenics was held in London in 1912. Amongits directors were Winston Churchill and Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of thetelephone. By 1917, fifteen US States had eugenics laws, and all but a few ofthem made legal the compulsory sterilisation of epileptics, the mentally ill andretarded, and regular criminals.In 1932, a year before Hitler and Roosevelt came to power, the Harrimans helpedto organise the Third International Congress on Eugenics at the American Museumof Natural History in New York. Averell Harriman’s sister, Mary, was thedirector of entertainment for the event. These wealthy American families, liketheir counterparts in Britain, feel themselves to be racially superior and theywish to protect their racial purity. This – along with the pursuit of power,wealth, and influence – is the reason why so many intermarriages take placewithin these families. America may not have an official royal family oraristocracy as they exist in Britain, but they have an unofficial one, and everyeffort is taken to trace one’s line back, often falsely, to William of Orangeand the British Royal Family, or to some wing of the British aristocracy.The aim of the eugenics movement was, and is, to create a Master Race by thesterilisation and forced birth control of those races considered ‘inferior’. TheInternational Congress of Eugenics in New York in 1932 tackled the ‘problem’ (asthey saw it) of African-Americans and other ‘inferior’ stock reproducing andexpanding their numbers. It was decided that the way to deal with this ‘danger’to the higher races (themselves) was through sterilisation and ‘cutting off thebad stock’. The Congress was dedicated to the work of Averell Harriman’s motherand Averell did his best to support the proceedings. He personally arranged forthe Hamburg-Amerika Shipping Line (controlled by himself, George Walker andPrescott Bush) to transport Nazis from Germany to New York so they could takepart in the Congress. The best known of them was Dr Ernst Rudin, a psychiatristat the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin. There heoccupied an entire floor with his eugenics ‘research’, and all of this was madepossible by funds provided by…the Rockefellers.18Dr Rudin was unanimously elected president of the International Federation ofEugenics Societies at the New York Congress, and this was, in part, arecognition of his work as a founder of the German Society for Race Hygiene. Theeugenics movement called for the sterilisation of mental patients (mentalhygiene societies); the execution of criminals, the insane, and the terminallyill (euthanasia societies); and race purification by sterilisation and theprevention of births to those considered inferior bloodstocks (populationcontrol societies). All of this was up and running long before anyone had heardof Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Hitler’s Germany was a vehicle for part of thismovement; it wasn’t the whole movement.Soon after Hitler had abolished elections and become dictator of Germany in1933, the Rockefeller-funded Dr Rudin was commissioned to write the Law for thePrevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity, which involved the forcedsterilisation of anyone considered genetically inferior. A quarter of a millionpeople who were mental patients, blind, deaf, or alcoholics were sterilised onthe order of special eugenics courts. Rudin supervised this policy and trainedthe psychiatrists and doctors to order and perform the sterilisations. But wheredid the Nazi Rudin get his inspiration from for the wording of his race laws?From the Model Eugenical Sterilization Law of 1922, presented by H.H. Laughlin,the eugenics ‘expert’ of the US House of Representatives Committee onImmigration and Nationalisation, which was accepted by many States. Eugenics wasnot unique to Nazi Germany. In 1942, the American ‘psychiatrist’ Foster Kennedycalled for the killing of retarded children, and between 1941 and ‘43 more than42,000 people were sterilised in America.19Nor did the master race mentality end in 1945 with the demise of Hitler’sGermany. Obviously, talk of master races, racial purity, and sterilisation toimprove the stock was bad PR, once some of the tales of Nazi projects began tobe known. But all that happened was that the names for master race policies werechanged to disguise the true meaning. We began to hear about euthanasia andpopulation control instead of eugenics and race purification, but it’s all thesame thing really. What the Harrimans, Rockefellers, and people like PrescottBush were funding and supporting before and during the war, their successorshave continued to promote under the cover of ‘acceptable’ language. Forinstance, one of the people who worked with the Harrimans and Prescott Bush intheir funding of Hitler was William H. Draper Jr, the man who helped to fund theNazi cartels and was then appointed by Roosevelt after the war to decide whatshould be done with them.Draper, a close associate of Averell Harriman, was a major funder of theInternational Eugenics Congress before the war and was one of those responsiblefor making Dr Ernst Rudin the head of the world eugenics movement. In 1958,Draper was appointed to chair a committee which was advising President DwightEisenhower (CFR) on the use of military aid to other countries. This appointmentwas made possible by Prescott Bush, who was then a US Senator for Connecticut.Bush was a regular golf partner of the president and of National SecurityAdvisor Gordon Gray (a close friend and eugenics promoter). By now, John FosterDulles (Bush’s former lawyer during the funding of Hitler) was the Secretary ofState, and his brother Allen Dulles (formerly with Schroder, Hitler’s personalbankers) was head of the CIA. To put it mildly, a eugenics enthusiast likeDraper had many people around him of like mind. This allowed him to change thewhole thrust of his committee from that of advising on military aid tocampaigning on the threat of the ‘population explosion’. His committeeformulated plans to depopulate the poorer countries: i.e. those people who donot have white skins. The growth of such peoples, said Draper, was a threat tothe national security of the United States.20Eisenhower dismissed Draper’s proposals, but with support from his fellow racialpurity fanatics, he went on to found the Population Crisis Committee/‘DraperFund’, which – together with the Rockefeller and DuPont families – continued topromote eugenics under the guise of population control. Draper was advisor toPresident Lyndon Johnson on this subject and that administration began to usethe overseas aid programme to fund birth control in non-white countries.Another of Draper’s21 like-minds in American politics was to be Prescott’s son,George Bush, a vocal supporter of General Draper’s policies. Bush arrangedhearings as early as 1969 into the dangers posed by the birth of too many blackbabies. Draper’s son and heir, William H. Draper III, was co-chairman forfinance and head of fundraising for the George Bush For President campaign in1980. Later in that decade, Bush persuaded Ronald Reagan to appoint the youngerDraper to be administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, anorganisation connected with the World Bank and charged with supervisingpopulation control!Eugenics and master race policies were passed on across the generations of theseruling families of the Elite. During George Bush’s tenure in the White House,the population control element of the aid budget soared. His legal counsel from1980 was Boyden Gray, who became the chief legal advisor to the President duringthe Bush administration. Gray would have been able to give him plenty of adviceon population control. When Boyden was a boy after the war, his father, GordonGray (Prescott Bush’s close friend), launched the project which provided thebasis of today’s global sterilisation programme. In 1946, the eugenics movementwas trying to rebuild itself in the wake of the rather unfortunate publicityaroused by one of its chief advocates, Adolf Hitler. During the war, TheSterilization League of America had changed its name to Birthright Inc., and wasnow looking for a means to get back to business. Its efforts to relaunch itselfin Iowa ended when a young boy died during a sterilisation operation and the badpublicity brought an end to the plan. Instead they moved to Gray familyterritory in North Carolina. Gordon Gray had founded the Bowman Gray (Memorial)Medical School in Winston-Salem. It was named after Boyden’s grandfather, whohad owned the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The school became a centre foreugenics. It compiled extensive records of families carrying ‘inheriteddiseases’, and it began a project which…get this…forcibly sterilised youngchildren who were not considered to be of a high enough IQ. No, no, I am nottalking about Nazi Germany during the war; I am talking about the United Statesof America in 1946–1947! Boyden Gray’s great aunt, Alice Shelton Gray, foundedthe Human Betterment League (the North Carolina branch of the national eugenicssterilisation movement), and she was the official supervisor of the master raceexperiment that was begun at the Grays’ ‘medical school’. Others involved wereDr Claude Nash Herndon, the assistant director of ‘medical genetics’ at theschool, and Dr Clarence Gamble (the heir to the Proctor and Gamble soap empire),who was the chief of ‘national field operations’. Children enrolled in theWinston-Salem school district were given ‘intelligence tests’ and those who fellbelow the mark considered acceptable to these bizarre people were sterilised.Their recommendations were passed to the State Eugenics Board, which had theauthority to order sterilisation under North Carolina law. Dr Claude NashHerndon talked of his work in an interview in 1990 which was reported in GeorgeBush, The Unauthorised Biography:> “…IQ tests were run on all the children in the Winston-Salem school system.> Only the ones who scored really low [were targeted for sterilisation], the> real bottom of the barrel, like below 70. Did we do sterilizations on young> children? Yes. This was a relatively minor operation…It was usually not [done]> until the child was eight or ten years old. For the boys, you just make an> incision and tie the tube…We more often performed the operation on girls than> with boys. Of course, you have to cut open the abdomen, but again, it is> relatively minor.” (p59)Oh, that’s OK then. What were the media doing while all this was going on? Not alot, it turns out. Dr Herndon talked of their “good relationship” with thepress. This is less surprising when you realise that Gordon Gray owned theWinston-Salem Journal, the Twin City Sentinel and the radio station WSJS.Eugenics was being promoted on a wide scale after the war in the guise ofpopulation control, just as it is today. In the early 50s, when John FosterDulles was chairman of the tax-exempt New World Order front, the RockefellerFoundation, he travelled with John D. Rockefeller III on a number of world tourscampaigning for policies to stem the expansion of the non-white populations. InNovember 1952, Dulles and Rockefeller launched the Population Council with tensof millions of dollars provided by the Rockefeller family. The American EugenicsSociety left its old headquarters at Yale University, the home of the sinisterSkull and Bones Society, and moved in with the Population Council. The twoorganisations, in effect, became one. The first president of the PopulationCouncil was Frederick Osborne, the long-time secretary of the American EugenicsSociety. The child-steriliser of North Carolina, Dr Claude Nash Herndon, wasmade president of the Eugenics Society in 1953.When George Bush became ambassador to the United Nations in 1972, he and hisclique in the US Agency for International Development arranged the firstofficial contract between the American government and the Sterilization Leagueof America, which had, by then, changed its name yet again, to the Associationfor Voluntary Surgical Contraception. Under this contract, the US government(taxpayer) began to fund this organisation to do in non-white countries of theworld what it had already done to children in North Carolina. In 1988, the yearGeorge Bush was elected president, another contract was arranged which involvedthe American taxpayer spending $80 million dollars over five years to expandthis work in 58 countries in Asia, Africa, and Spanish-America. Millions havebeen sterilised and most of it has been funded by the taxpayer. Other countriesdo the same. And by the way, Dr Clarence Gamble, the sterilising enthusiast fromthe Proctor and Gamble soap family and the Bowman Gray Medical School, has alsoenjoyed funding from the USAID budget. His so called Pathfinder Fund is paid toinfiltrate non-white societies and break down resistance to sterilisation.The Planned Parenthood Federation, which has been supported at every opportunityby George Bush and the manipulating Elite, was actually founded in London, atthe offices of the British Eugenics Society. You can see that while the nameschange and the rhetoric may be couched in terms deemed acceptable to publicopinion at the time, we are looking at the same unwavering agenda, weaving itsway through the decades and the generations. Nazi Germany was but its mostfamous example. Global centralisation of power, fundamental control of the mindsand bodies of the mass population, and the creation of a master race. These arethe themes that span the centuries and they still dominate the secret agendatoday, which is manipulating our lives.But how many people in this world believe they are racially superior to therest? The number is so vast it doesn’t bear thinking about. Ironically, many ofthose who have suffered from the master race mentality of one race, actuallybelieve that they, themselves, are superior genetically to others. Thatattitude, that thought pattern, is broadcast into the collective mind, whichcreates a collective version of that reality. If within our psyche, we believewe are racially superior, we are more likely to attract that same mentality tous. A feeling of racial superiority is an imbalance and our subconsciousattracts our imbalances to us as physical experiences so we can face them, learnfrom those experiences, and let them go. These imbalances often relate tothought patterns we hold onto from previous physical lives as well as this one,which is why someone who does not have a conscious feeling of racial superioritymight still attract a racial experience to them. It is our subconscious realitythat we are creating. We – humanity as a whole – thought the global master racementality/reality into existence and we can now think it out again, by seeingall colours and creeds as equal, which they are.The Elite can get away with its deception because it has so many faces and worksthrough so many different groups and organisations. In the next three chapters,I will unravel some of this structure and make it easier for those new to thissubject to understand how the Elite remains hidden from most of the world whilesecretly plotting our collective fate.> SOURCES> > > 1 Jewish Chronicle (April 7th 1995)> > > 2 Major Alojzy Dziurski, Freedom Fighter (J.A.

Europewas devastated, physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually and economically– as it was planned to be.The enormity of the deceit may be hard to comprehend as you survey those endlessrows of white gravestones in the war cemeteries of France, but those young menand women did not die for freedom in its true sense. They died to satisfy theElite agenda for global domination and, on a higher level, to deepen the controlof the Prison Warders on the Fourth Dimension. Of course, if those soldiers onboth sides had known that, there would have been no war. Instead, they werepresented with a story that the Nazis were a uniquely evil creation that had tobe stopped by the forces of goodness, freedom, and virtue. Again, another blackand white fantasy. The Nazi philosophy was unspeakable, but it was also thephilosophy of those who controlled the Allies. The same forces funded andmanipulated both of them.At the end of World War II, the United States was the most powerful country onEarth. It had bankrolled the war and, through the lend-lease system of supplyingarmaments on the basis of ‘have now, pay later’, Europe was drowning in debt tothe American – Elite-controlled – bankers. Roosevelt had told Churchill yearsearlier that the British Empire would have to be dismantled and now that was acertainty. Britain’s long period of pre-eminence was over, destroyed by the twoWorld Wars. For me, Britain should never have had an ‘empire’ in the firstplace, but we need to keep our eyes on why it was brought to an end by thoseplotting their own world supremacy. If you read the Illuminati Protocols (whichI included in The Robots’ Rebellion), you will see that the use of debt and warsas a means of control was precisely what the manipulators had always planned.These protocols came to light late in the last century and, although they havebeen condemned as a ‘forgery’, they tell the story of the twentieth century withremarkable accuracy. Whoever wrote them knew what was coming. The debt they talkabout was to grow still more, with the European countries borrowing heavily fromAmerica, to rebuild their towns and cities in the aftermath of all the bombingthat had gone on.The United States (Global Elite) introduced its Grand Area strategy to controlWestern Europe, the whole of the Western hemisphere, the Middle and Far East,and the former British Empire. The Third World was essential to this policy. Inthe words of a 1949 memo by the US State Department, the Third World would“…fulfil its major function as a source of raw materials and a market forindustrial capitalist societies”.1 Put another way, it was going to be mentally,emotionally, and physically raped. George Kennan at the State Department evensuggested at this time that Europe might enjoy a ‘psychological lift’ fromexploiting Africa, as declassified documents reveal.2 Vital to this plan was toensure that no country, particularly in the Third World, was allowed to delinkfrom Elite economic domination and run their economy for the benefit of thepeople. This so called ‘threat of a good example’, which others might follow,led to slaughter across South and Central America and the East, includingVietnam. Henry Kissinger (Comm 300) would call the introduction of social andeconomic reforms in Third World countries a ‘virus’ that, if allowed to thrive,would ‘infect’ a much wider area.3 Or, as Secretary of State Dean Acheson (Comm300) said in the late 1940s, “One rotten apple can spoil the barrel”. TheElite’s barrel.The more terror that could be used against leaders and people trying toeliminate dependency on the Elite bankers and multinationals, the less likely itwas that anyone else would try it. This was the fundamental and base motivationbehind the United States (Elite) strategy which engineered the horrors inVietnam, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Brazil, Italy, Chile, the DominicanRepublic, Laos, Grenada, Honduras, Iran, and Indonesia. You would need a map ofthe world to list them all. Behind these events and the overthrow ofdemocratically elected governments were many of the Nazis employed all over theworld by the CIA. The SS officer and Gestapo chief, Klaus Barbie, the ‘Butcherof Lyon’, was one who was employed by the Americans to spy on the French. Forhundreds, if not thousands, of Hitler’s men who were bankrolled by the CIA, itwas ‘business as usual’ after the ‘defeat’ of Nazism. The manipulation washappening on many levels, but the most important goal was to cause so muchconflict between nation states (the problem), that public opinion would demandthat something must be done (the reaction), and the Elite could then unveil itslong-term plan for centralised global institutions under the control of a tinyclique (the solution).In summary, the foundation themes of the Elite’s plan immediately after the warwere the following:> > • To introduce a world authority called the United Nations (with> > associated bodies like the World Health Organisation), which could evolve> > into a world government with powers to control the lives of everyone on the> > planet.> > • To continue to cause conflicts across the world and to use the fear of> > the Soviet Union to massively increase spending on nuclear weapons and> > ‘conventional’ weapons, thus adding to the terror of nuclear war and demands> > for global security. To set up an American-European defence alliance (which> > was called the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)) and a United> > Nations ‘peace’ keeping force, which, through the engineering of conflicts,> > would eventually be fused together to form the world army.> > • To create three ‘free trade’ regions in Europe, the Americas, and Asia,> > which would be sold to people initially as merely economic groupings.> > Gradually, however, these would be evolved into centralised political> > unions, with one central bank and one currency. These would be> > stepping-stones to the introduction of the same institutions on a global> > scale. The European Economic Community, now the European Union, was the> > first of these, but the other two are now underway, also.> > • To advance the control of public opinion and to research and expand the> > understanding of how to manipulate the human psyche, individually and> > collectively. Today this agenda includes the microchipping of people and> > their permanent connection to a global computer.> > • To create a welfare state while destroying alternatives to the economic> > system and, when the desired dependency had been achieved, to dismantle that> > state welfare support, so creating a vast underclass without help or hope.> > • To make fantastic amounts of money in the course of realising all of> > these ambitions via the Elite-controlled companies and banks.> > • To continually add to the debt burdens of people, business, and state,> > thus increasing the control exerted over them.The approach which was followed to hoodwink public thinking was painfullypredictable, but highly effective: Discredit the nation state. This was laid outduring the War by the German economist and refugee, Hans Heymann, who producedhis Plan for Permanent Peace using funds given by…the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace. In this work he said:> “Nations have created international disharmony in the vain belief that harmony> in our society can be achieved on a national basis…This narrow-minded approach> has left us one strong hope, namely, that this fallacious concept may hold> only during a transitional period…After the debacle [World War Two] an> international organisation will be imperative, for the well-being of society> as a whole.” 4It was classic problem-reaction-solution. In 1945, the original Round Tablesecret society had two main offshoots – the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs (RIIA) at Chatham House in London (which had branches in many otherparts of the world), and the RIIA’s United States branch, the Council on ForeignRelations (CFR) in New York (which had branches across the United States). Inthe post-war years, these would be joined by the Bilderberg Group (Bil), theTrilateral Commission (TC), and the Club of Rome (CR) to form a highly effectivenetwork of manipulation which comprises a very significant element of the secretgovernment of the world – a government that is far more powerful than anyelected authority (Figure 7).You will find the membership of these organisations among the elite of globalpolitics and political ‘advisors’, banking, oil companies, multinationalcorporations, media owners, executives and journalists, the military, the law,and education. They work as organisations within organisations, infiltratingthese spheres of influence and secretly promoting the Global Elite agenda. Themajority of their colleagues and employees have no idea what is going on or howthey are being used. As with the Round Table, there are distinct circles ofpeople within these front groups. There is an elite core who work full time forthe cause; a circle of members who know the agenda and work within their ownorganisations to achieve it; and an outer circle of members who are not aware ofthe real and full implications of the agenda, but are useful to the manipulatorsin the short term. Not everyone who is a member of these organisations is aconscious manipulator and we need to use our intuition and the informationpresented by researchers to decide which ones know the score and which are beingused without understanding what they are really involved in. In this chapter, Iwill outline the background and influence of these groupings and of theirassociated power blocs, the United Nations and the European Union.[../Images/00022.jpg]Figure 7The Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA)The Anglo-American Elite who met at the Versailles Peace Conference in Paris in1919 formed the RIIA and the Council on Foreign Relations in 1920 and 1921, asdiscussed earlier. The so called ‘special relationship’ between Britain andAmerica is, in fact, the relationship between the RIIA and the Council onForeign Relations. Today the Royal Institute, with the Queen as its patron, hasan enormous effect on British and global policy. It is the British ForeignOffice. So why, it can be fairly asked, has British economic and political powerbeen curtailed? The answer is that the British manipulators are far moreinterested in creating a world government than in improving Britain as acountry. If curtailing British economic power and the empire was necessary forthis wider plan, then so be it. As with the ‘Jewish’ clique, their commitment isto the cause of the All-Seeing Eye cult, not the interests of the people.At the time of this writing, the RIIA’s three joint presidents are LordCarrington (Comm 300), the former Conservative cabinet minister (includingForeign Secretary), Secretary-General of NATO, member of the TrilateralCommission, and, from 1991, the chairman of the Bilderberg Group; Lord Callaghanof Cardiff, the former Labour Prime Minister, cabinet minister (includingForeign Secretary), and Bilderberg attendee; and Lord (Roy) Jenkins of Hillhead,a founding member in Europe of the Trilateral Commission, a Bilderberger, andthe former Labour Cabinet minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lord Jenkinswas one of the ‘Gang of Four’, along with former Labour Foreign Secretary, Lord(David) Owen (TC), who split the Labour Party in 1981 by launching their ownSocial Democratic Party (SDP). He was also a President of the EuropeanCommission and, together with people like the former Conservative PrimeMinister, Edward Heath (Bil, TC), he is a passionate advocate of European union.The chairman of the RIIA is the former Conservative MP, Christopher (now Lord)Tugendhat, the chairman of the Abbey National Building Society and Governor ofthe Ditchley Foundation, which is a front for the New World Order, according tomany researchers and published works. Tugendhat describes the European Union as,“the most hopeful and beneficent political development to be undertaken in thispart of the world this century…it is a brave and noble [sic] venture that I amproud to be able to serve”.5 The Institute names as ‘honorary presidents’ the“presidents and prime ministers of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealthcountries”.6 The presidents, prime ministers, and political elite throughout theworld speak at the Institute, often under the secrecy of the ‘Chatham HouseRule’. This says that:> “When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule,> participants are free to use the information received, but neither the> identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other> participant, may be revealed; nor may it be mentioned that the information was> received at a meeting of the Institute.” 7So much for open government. The Institute is highly secretive and will notrelease details of its membership in high places. Why not, if it is only a‘think tank’? What is there to hide? When I rang to ask for a list of members inthe British Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet, I was told by the membership secretarythat the names of individual members are never released. To join, you have to benominated by two members who know you well and even then you might not pass theselection procedure. Running alongside this membership is another which is onlyallowed access to the Institute’s library. This second form of membership helpsto smokescreen what is going on elsewhere in the organisation. The Institute isfunded today, as it has been from the start, by the major global companies andbanks. Its ‘Energy and Environment Programme’ is paid for by major oilcompanies, coal and electricity producers, and the Atomic Energy Authority. Mygoodness, I bet that’s unbiased! Major corporate members of the RIIA are: MorganGuaranty Trust Company of New York (J.P. Morgan); S.G. Warburg Group plc (beforeits takeover); 8 Barings plc (before its mysterious and high profile collapse);9 the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office; the Ministry of Defence; theUnited States Embassy; the RTZ Corporation; Anglo-American Corporation of SouthAfrica; British Petroleum; Shell International; Bank of England; Barclays Bank;Lloyds Bank; National Westminster Bank; Lazard Brothers; TSB Group; AbbeyNational; Midland Montagu; Coopers and Lybrand; Unilever; British AmericanTobacco Industries; British Aerospace; The Economist; Gerard Atkins and Co Ltd;John Swire and Sons Ltd; and Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI).The other corporate members comprise a list of the world’s leading companies,countries, and media. Even the Church of England is in there, along with theAfrican National Congress (ANC) and Amnesty International. Why is AmnestyInternational supporting an organisation through which manipulation isorchestrated that adds massively to the number of political prisoners? Mediaorganisations supporting the RIIA include ABC News Intercontinental Inc; CBSNews; NBC News Worldwide Inc; Britain’s Channel Four TV and IndependentTelevision News (ITN); Fuji Television; Der Spiegel; The European; The FinancialTimes; The Guardian; The Independent and Independent On Sunday; The Observer;Daily Telegraph; The Times; The Scotsman; The Yorkshire Post; Reuters, theinternational news agency; The New York Times; The Washington Post; The WallStreet Journal; The Reader’s Digest; and, quite outrageously for an organisationclaiming to be independent, the BBC World Service; the BBC Monitoring Service;and BBC Radio.Taxpayer funding and support for the RIIA is given not only by the British andCommonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, but also the Cabinet Office,the Treasury, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Trade andIndustry, Customs and Excise, and many other sources. The British Labour PartyInternational Department is a corporate member, along with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), and so are other names we have seen throughout this book. Theseinclude the Chase Manhattan Bank (the post-war amalgamation of the Rockefellers’Chase Bank and the Rothschild/Warburg Bank of Manhattan), Morgan and Warburgcompanies and amalgamations, N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd, J. Henry Schroder(also acting as the bankers for the BBC charity, the Children in Need Appeal),the Ford Motor Company, and that population control organisation so beloved ofGeorge Bush, the Planned Parenthood Federation. Another name which keeps comingup in my investigations is the Hambros Bank Ltd, which is also a corporatemember of the RIIA. The creation of a United States of Europe under centralisedcontrol is a major stepping-stone in the New World Order plan, and so it isappropriate and hardly surprising that the RIIA is also supported by theCommission of the European Communities, the European Parliament UK Office, theEuropean Policy Advisers (UK) Ltd, European Round Table (how apt!) ofIndustrialists, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.10The Institute is used as a private forum for the elite to sell their New WorldOrder ideas to invited audiences and those with influence in the media,politics, education and commerce. It is a lobbying organisation, in effect, forthe New World Order and a means (outside the ‘official’ government machine)through which deals can be done and events arranged without the knowledge ofeither the public or elected parliaments. It is more than that, however. It is acentral and powerful pivot in the secret government network, with very closelinks to the British Royal Family and British Intelligence. Again, most of thepeople involved with the RIIA do not realise how it is being used.The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and The United Nations (UN)The CFR is the Royal Institute, Stateside branch. The only major differencebetween them is that the CFR membership list is more widely available and someof its members have been so disturbed by what they have seen and heard that theyhave spoken out against it. Not many, but some. If only that were the case inBritain, where they leave the Americans standing when it comes to secrecy! Mostof the ‘secrets’ that come to the surface in Britain are those which have beenpurposely leaked to undermine a politician, personality, or group, for somedesired, manipulative end. This general rule also applies in the US, but theBritish establishment has had longer to perfect its leak-proofing techniques.Since the formation of the CFR, every president of the United States has been amember except for Ronald Reagan. In truth Reagan was not president, hisvice-president George Bush, a CFR member, was running the show. It was theCouncil on Foreign Relations, no doubt with RIIA input and coordination, thatbrought the United Nations (the successor to the League of Nations) into being.This was the jewel of the post-war manipulators and one of the main reasons theSecond World War was fashioned. By 1945, the world was understandably sick andtired of war and the public mind was open to anything that might prevent morehuman slaughter. Problem-reaction-solution brought forth the United Nations. TheUN Charter was officially accepted by representatives of fifty countries at ameeting in San Francisco on June 26th 1945. But that was only the publicculmination of years of behind-the-scenes manoeuvring by the Council on ForeignRelations, which controlled the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Thewriter, James Perloff, revealed the background to the UN in his 1988 book, TheShadows Of Power: The Council On Foreign Relations And The American Decline:> “In January 1943, the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, formed a steering> committee composed of himself, Leo Pasvolsky, Isaiah Bowman, Sumner Welles,> Norman Davis, and Morton Taylor. All these men – with the exception of Hull –> were in the CFR. Later known as the Informal Agenda Group, they drafted the> original proposal for the United Nations. It was Bowman – a founder of the CFR> and member of Colonel House’s old ‘Inquiry’ – who first put forward the> concept. They called in three attorneys, all CFR men, who ruled that it was> constitutional. Then they discussed it with Franklin D. Roosevelt on June> 15th, 1944. The President approved the plan, and announced it to the public> the same day.” 11In his book, The American Language, H.L. Mencken suggests that the term ‘UnitedNations’ was decided by President Roosevelt during a meeting with WinstonChurchill at the White House in December 1941, shortly before the attack onPearl Harbor.12 The US delegation at the founding meeting of the UN was like aroll call of the CFR. It included Isaiah Bowman, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, SumnerWelles, Norman H. Davis, James T. Shotwell, and the Russian-born Leo Pasvolsky.They were all CFR members who served during the war on Roosevelt’s AdvisoryCommittee on Post-War Foreign Policies. In all, seventy-four CFR members were inthe delegation. This was the vehicle through which the United Nations wasmanipulated into being.The US delegation at the San Francisco Conference also included: John J. McCloy(CFR chairman from 1953-70, a member of the Committee of 300, the chairman ofthe Ford Foundation and the Rockefellers’ Chase Manhattan Bank, and friend andadvisor to nine presidents from Roosevelt to Reagan); John Foster Dulles (Hitlersupporter, CFR founder, and soon to be Secretary of State); and NelsonRockefeller (an arch manipulator, four times elected Governor of New York, andvice president in the administration of President Gerald Ford). The attitude ofJohn J. McCloy typified that of the manipulators who created the UN. He was afinancial advisor to the Italian fascist government of Benito Mussolini and heplayed a significant role in Nazi Germany for the Harriman/Bush bank which wasfinancing Hitler. McCloy sat in Hitler’s private box at the 1936 Olympics inBerlin at the invitation of Rudolf Hess and Hermann Göring.13 McCloy was also amember of the Bilderberg Group Steering Committee.The secretary general of the conference was the State Department official andCFR member, Alger Hiss, later exposed as a secret agent employed by the SovietUnion. Hiss was executive secretary of the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference, wherehe worked with Stalin’s man, Vyacheslav Molotov, on the details of the UNCharter. He was described as President Roosevelt’s ‘top internationalorganisation specialist’ at the Yalta Conference in the Crimea in February 1945,which was also attended by Churchill and Stalin. After guiding the UN intoexistence, Hiss was made president of the infamous Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace, an appointment made by John Foster Dulles, who ignoredinformation about Hiss’s espionage when he was told about it in 1946. Later Hisswas exposed and spent 44 months in prison.Other covert Communist Party members of the CFR were in the US delegation in SanFrancisco for the launch of the UN, among them Dexter White, who was alsorevealed as a Soviet agent. The Council on Foreign Relations directs the UnitedStates policy, whatever ‘party’ is officially in power. As John J. McCloy oncesaid: “Whenever we needed a man [for a government position] we thumbed throughthe roll of the council members and put through a call to New York” (The CFRheadquarters at Harold Pratt House, 58 East 68th Street).14 The granddaughter offormer President Theodore Roosevelt, the newspaper columnist Edith KermitRoosevelt, summed up the grip of the so called ‘Eastern Establishment’ workingthrough the CFR:> “What is the Establishment’s view-point? Through the Roosevelt, Truman,> Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations its ideology is constant: that the best> way to fight Communism is by a One World Socialist State governed by ‘experts’> like themselves. The result has been policies which favour the growth of the> superstate, gradual surrender of United States sovereignty…” 15Robert W. Lee, writing in the September 1992 edition of The New American pointedout that at least fourteen of the eighteen US secretaries of state since the CFRwas founded in 1921 have been members of that organisation, including the actingsecretary of state at the time of the article, Lawrence Eagleburger. The lasteight directors of the CIA, including George Bush, had been CFR members, andover the previous four decades, the Democratic and Republican Party candidatesfor president or vice president who were (or became) members of the CFR wereDwight D. Eisenhower, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Henry Cabot Lodge,Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Edmund Muskie, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter,Walter Mondale, Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, George Bush, Michael Dukakis,Geraldine Ferraro, and Bill Clinton.This, then, is the organisation which created the United Nations.16 The UN evenbuilt its headquarters in New York on land given free of charge by theRockefellers. Besides the Rockefellers, names like Morgan, Warburg, Schiff, andMarburg were manipulating in the background, behind the politicians andadvisors. The United Nations was sold to the public as a means to bring peace tothe world, to solve differences by words, not war. Most of the people who workfor the UN genuinely believe that is its purpose. They are about to bedisillusioned on that score, I’m afraid. The UN is but a ‘Trojan Horse’ for theglobal fascist/communist tyranny known as the New World Order. It is the vehiclethrough which the world government and world army are being manipulated intoplace and through which public opinion is being softened up, by conflicts andpropaganda, to accept this policy as the only way to bring peace and stabilityto human affairs. All seven of the UN secretary generals since 1945 havepromoted such thinking. The last holder of the office, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali,began his career under the Egyptian dictator, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Boutros-Ghalicalled for a permanent UN Army (world army) and for the UN to have the right tolevy taxation (world government). His successor, Kofi Annan, wants the same.The original United Nations has given birth to a stream of connectedorganisations which coordinate the New World Order plan in areas like health(World Health Organisation), population control or – more accurately – eugenics,(the UN Population Fund – UNFPA), economic development and environment (the UNEnvironment Programme – UNEP), education, science and culture (UNESCO), and thelist is getting longer all the time. These are organisations which are designedto globalise control of all areas of our lives and we urgently need to wake upto this. The UN is a front for the Illuminati/Freemasonic hierarchy. In a speechin 1970, Robert Welch, the founder of the John Birch Society in America,predicted with remarkable accuracy what the United Nations would become:> “The United Nations hopes and plans – or, more accurately, the insiders, the> conspiratorial bosses above it, hope and plan for it – to use population> controls, controls over scientific and technological developments, control> over arms and military strength of individual nations, control over education,> control over health, and all the controls it can gradually establish under all> of the different excuses for international jurisdiction that it can devise.> These variegated separate controls are to become components of the gradually> materialising total control that it expects to achieve by pretense, deception,> persuasion, beguilement, and falsehoods, while the enforcement of such> controls by brutal force and terror is also getting under way.” 17That is what the United Nations was always intended to do; that is what it wascreated to do; that is what it is now doing.The European Economic Community – now The European UnionThe plan to create three global trading blocks which would eventually be mergedinto one is not new. It has been a long-term plan to centralise power in Europe,the Americas, and Asia-Australia, via groupings promoted initially as free tradeareas, but later evolving into the European Union, the American Union, and thePacific Union. The European Economic Community was the first, and this has beenfollowed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which involves theUS, Canada, and Mexico. This agreement was signed by President George Bush onAugust 12th 1992. In my scores of public talks throughout 1994, I said that thiswould eventually be expanded to encompass the whole of the Americas. This wasnot prophecy, simply knowledge of the game plan. It doesn’t matter whatpresident is nominally in power, be it Republican or Democrat, the plan rumbleson. What was it that George Bush, a Republican, said when NAFTA was launched?That he wished to see a free trade area stretching from the top of North Americato the tip of South America. What was it that Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said ata gathering of leaders from throughout the American continent on December 10th1994?> “History has given the people of the Americas the chance to build a community> of nations, committed to liberty and the promise of prosperity… early in the> next century [I want to see]…a huge free trade zone from Alaska to Argentina.”Spot the difference? No, nor me. Another thing I was predicting through 1994,again from knowledge of the agenda, was the creation of the third ‘free tradearea’ involving Asia and Australia. On November 16th 1994, I picked up a copy ofthe London Daily Telegraph to see that this had been agreed to on the previousday. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping was accepted at aSummit meeting near Jakarta, Indonesia, attended by Bill Clinton, Paul Keating(the Australian Prime Minister), and heads of the Asian governments. EitherKeating is in on the scam or he is easily duped. Now the process will begin ofevolving the two latest trading blocs into the model used in Europe beforemerging them all into one.The plan for a United States of Europe under centralised control goes backcenturies. It was one of the goals of the Knights Templar. When the Templarswere destroyed in their stronghold in France by a combination of the French Kingand the Pope, many of those who survived the onslaught regrouped in Scotland andthe Templars reformed under the pseudonym, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.This has a large number of its members in the high places of influence and powerin the world, not the least in the United States. The men behind the EuropeanCommunity, now the European Union, were Jean Omar Marie Gabriel Monnet (Comm300), the son of a French brandy merchant; Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi(Comm 300) from Austria; and Joseph Retinger (Comm 300), a Polish socialist, whoformed an organisation called the European Movement to press for central controlof Europe. He was also most influential in the creation of the Bilderberg Group,one of the key vehicles for secret government manipulation. Jean Monnet was themost important figure, however, in European union.Monnet went to Canada in 1910, at the age of just twenty to seek new markets forthe family brandy business. There he linked up with the Hudson Bay Company andthe Lazard Brothers banking operation and became part of the Anglo-Americanscene, even though he was French. He became a confidant to presidents and primeministers, and this won him a highly lucrative contract to ship materials fromCanada to France during the First World War. When the war ended he was appointedto the Allied Supreme Economic Council and he became advisor to the group aroundLord Milner (Comm 300) and Colonel House (Comm 300), which was preparing theTreaty of Versailles and creating the League of Nations. By 1919, his influenceand reputation among the manipulators was such that he was named the DeputySecretary General of The League of Nations. The same names again. Six yearslater he moved to America and became vice president of a company owned by theBank of America, called Transamerica. Monnet was now in the perfect position tocoordinate the America-European conspiracy to create the European Community.Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote a book in 1923, calling for a UnitedStates of Europe. He was named after Richard Wagner, of whom Hitler had saidthat to understand Nazi Germany one had to understand Wagner. A close friend ofthe Count’s father was Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism. The Count’s bookwas called Pan Europa, and he went on to form the Pan European Union withbranches right across the continent, supported by leading European politicians,the Anglo-American Establishment, including Colonel House and Herbert Hoover,and the usual crowd that pop up everywhere. The Count said in his autobiography:> “At the beginning of 1924, we received a call from Baron Louis de Rothschild;> one of his friends, Max Warburg, from Hamburg, had read my book and wanted to> get to know us. To my great surprise [sure!], Warburg spontaneously [sure!]> offered us 60,000 gold marks to tide the movement over for its first three> years…Max Warburg, who was one of the most distinguished and wisest men that I> have ever come into contact with, had a principle of financing these> movements. He remained sincerely interested in Pan-Europe for his entire life.> Max Warburg arranged his 1925 trip to the United States to introduce me to> Paul Warburg and Bernard Baruch.” 18Also among the supporters of the Pan European Movement was Winston Churchill(Comm 300), who wrote an article in 1930 for the American publication, TheSaturday Evening Post, entitled “The United States of Europe”. This was nineyears before the Second World War for which Churchill so vigorously campaigned –a war that was responsible for creating the European Community. CountCoudenhove-Kalergi was given enthusiastic backing from such ‘unbiased’ sourcesas John Foster Dulles, Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of ColumbiaUniversity and the Carnegie Endowment for International War (sorry, ‘Peace’),and Dr Stephen Duggan, the founder and first president of the Institute ofEducation, which was 100% controlled by the Council on Foreign Relations. Thosewho funded the Bolshevik Revolution and both sides in the two World Wars,including Adolf Hitler, were plotting to introduce the European Community aswell as the United Nations.Meanwhile, Monnet was also close to Franklin D. Roosevelt, thanks to hisrelationship with the President’s influential aide, Harry Hopkins, who was toRoosevelt what Colonel House had been to President Wilson. Hopkins was financedby the Rockefellers and he was their man in the White House. He was recruited byNelson Rockefeller to work on the New Deal which actually prolonged the UnitedStates depression.19 Both Monnet and Hopkins were supporters of the Soviet Unionand Monnet was deeply involved in the lend-lease policies through which vastamounts of weapons, other materials, and knowledge of US nuclear technology weretransferred to the communist world. Organisations like the Federal UnionMovement – later the Atlantic Union Committee and the Atlantic Council of theUnited States – were formed to press for the union of America and Britain. Suchbodies were dominated by CFR members.Among the directors of the Atlantic Council in the 1970s were George Bush (Comm300) and one of the world’s most influential and tireless manipulators, HenryKissinger (Comm 300), of whom much more will be revealed as our storyprogresses. The pressure and propaganda for European Union reached new heightsin May 1948, when the United European Movement held its Congress of Europe. Theleading advocates of the Movement were Winston Churchill and his son-in-law, theBritish politician Duncan Sandys, and working behind the scenes to great effectwere Jean Monnet and the creator of the Bilderberg Group, Joseph Retinger. TheCongress adopted seven Resolutions on the political union of Europe. One of themstated, “The creation of a United Europe must be regarded as an essential steptowards the creation of a United World” [world government]. Monnet also headedthe Committee for the United States of Europe, which had the same goal.20The post-war American loans to Europe, known as the Marshall Plan or EuropeanRecovery Programme (ERP), were used both to provide funds for the European Unionmovement and to undermine the independence of sovereign states and increase thepressure for the central control of Europe. This aid plan was supposed to be thework of General George C. Marshall, President Truman’s Secretary of State, butit is now known that the architects were Jean Monnet and the Council on ForeignRelations.21 In 1946–1947, a CFR study group was formed to report on theReconstruction of Europe. The group was chaired by the lawyer, Charles M.Spofford, and the secretary was David Rockefeller (Comm 300), later to be headof the Chase Manhattan Bank, the chairman of the CFR, a leading influence in theBilderberg Group, and creator of another front for the Elite, the TrilateralCommission.Within little more than a year, this CFR ‘study group’ changed its name to theMarshall Plan and was sold as government policy. The man chosen to head theMarshall Plan in Europe was…Averell Harriman (Comm 300), who based himself atthe Rothschild’s Paris Mansion, Hotel Talleyrand. The proposal was not given aneasy ride and there were many congressmen who could see through the smokescreen.The CFR therefore launched a propaganda offensive by Elite organisations toensure that the policy was accepted. These included the CFR-controlled businessand trade union bodies and, of course, the CFR-controlled media. The policy of aUnited States of Europe was given sterling support from the CFR’s New York Timesand Washington Post.The Elite-contrived ‘Cold War’ would also be very useful, as indeed it would beon so many occasions in the decades that followed. The need to make loans toEurope to overcome the threat of communism (which the Elite had created) waseffectively used to win Congressional approval for the Marshall Plan. John J.McCloy (Comm 300), the chairman of the CFR for nearly twenty years, said thathis period as US High Commissioner to Germany after the war had shown him howthe use of the communist threat could get things done. “People sat up andlistened when the Soviet threat was mentioned”,22 he said. When the proposalssecured approval, the Marshall Plan executive board included Allen W. Dulles,then president of the CFR; Philip Reed, the chairman of General Electric; theformer secretaries of war, Henry L. Stimson and Robert P. Patterson; and theformer undersecretary of state, Dean Acheson (Comm 300), a member of the CFR whowas in the US delegation at the formation of the United Nations.The first step in the creation of the European Community was the introduction ofthe European Coal and Steel Community, which started in July 1952, and mergedthe coal and steel industries of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, theNetherlands, and Luxemburg under one central control. It had the powers todecide prices, investment, raise money, and make decisions by majority voting.It was introduced under the name The Schuman Plan (after the French socialistforeign minister and later prime minister, Robert Schuman), but once again theman behind it was Jean Monnet, then head of the French General PlanningCommission. The idea won gushing praise from CFR names like John Foster Dullesand Dean Acheson, and Monnet was awarded the Wateler Peace Prize of two millionfrancs to recognise the “international spirit which he had shown in conceivingthe Coal and Steel Community…”. Who made the award? The Carnegie Foundation! Twoadmirers of Monnet, Merry and Serge Bromberger, set out the plan in their book,Jean Monnet And The United States Of Europe:> “Gradually, it was thought, the supranational authorities, supervised by the> European Council of Ministers at Brussels and the Assembly in Strasbourg,> would administer all the activities of the Continent. A day would come when> governments would be forced to admit that an integrated Europe was an> accomplished fact, without their having had a say in the establishment of its> underlying principles. All they would have to do was to merge all these> autonomous institutions into a single federal administration and then proclaim> a United States of Europe.” 23Monnet and his plotters tried to introduce a European army under their centralcommand. They called for disarmament by the nations and the creation of onearmy. The same is happening today on a global scale. The six members of the Coaland Steel Community signed a treaty to this effect in 1952, but it failed tomaterialise when the French Parliament refused to accept it. Still, on March25th 1957, the six did sign the two Treaties of Rome to create the EuropeanEconomic Community or Common Market, and the European Atomic Energy Community(Euratom). The negotiations for the Treaties of Rome were controlled by Monnetwith constant help from the CFR network in the United States. This was confirmedby Harvard lecturer, Ernst H. van der Beugel, an honourary secretary-general ofthe Elite’s Bilderberg Group and a member of the Trilateral Commission. In hisbook, From Marshall Aid To Atlantic Partnership (foreword by his friend, HenryKissinger), he says:> “Monnet and his action committee were unofficially supervising the> negotiations and as soon as obstacles appeared, the United States diplomatic> machinery was alerted, mostly through Ambassador Bruce…who had immediate> access to the top echelon of the State Department…> “At that time, it was usual that if Monnet thought that a particular country> made difficulties in the negotiations, the American diplomatic representative> in that country approached the Foreign Ministry in order to communicate the> opinion of the American Government which, in practically all cases, coincided> with Monnet’s point of view.” 24Monnet = Global Elite. The Single European Act, which brought down tradebarriers across Europe from 1992, and the Maastricht Accords for European unionare just more stepping-stones along the road to the United States of Europeunder Elite control. The stepping-stones approach is used daily to fool thepublic. The manipulators know that if we were asked to move from nation statesovereignty to world government in one leap, even the bewildered herd might askwhat was going on and oppose it. So we are sold a series of intermediate stageswhich are promoted as isolated and unconnected events. Once we have acceptedone, the next is introduced until the final goal is reached by stealth. It islike putting someone in a bath of cold water and then heating it slowly until itboils. Only in the final stages does the victim realise what is happening and bythen it may be too late. Josef Stalin, the authoritarian dictator of the SovietUnion, explained this process in his book, Marxism And The National Question,published in 1942 when the Anglo-American-communist game plan was obviously wellknown to him. He wrote:> “Divide the world into regional groups as a transitional stage to world> government. Populations will more readily abandon their national loyalties to> a vague regional loyalty than they will for a world authority. Later, the> regionals can be brought all the way into a single world dictatorship.” 25Which is precisely what is happening. In 1984, the Soviet KGB defector, AnatoliyGolitsyn, warned that there would be a ‘false liberalisation’ in the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe. This would be welcomed by the West, he said, and itwould lead to a merger of the European Community and the countries of the formerSoviet Union. On the same weekend in December 1994, that Bill Clinton announcedplans for the NAFTA free trade area to be expanded across the Americas toArgentina, the European heads of government revealed plans to allow countries ofthe former Soviet Union to join the European Union. Events are now moving veryquickly. In the first draft of this chapter, I wrote that the plan was toeventually merge the former Soviet Union into the United States of Europe and,before this book was finished, it had been officially announced.Look at how far the confidence trick has travelled since the introduction of theEuropean Economic Community, or Common Market. We were told we had to join orthe British economy would collapse. Oh really? The current British deficit inEuropean trade and membership contributions since we joined is closing in on£100 billion!26 Once the peoples of Europe had been tricked into believing thatif they didn’t join they would all face disaster, the word economic was droppedfrom the title and it became the European Community (stepping-stone). Laterthere was another name change to the European Union (stepping-stone). We havealso had the move towards the centralisation of political power in the communityand the erosion of national decision-making (stepping-stone). This was followedby the pressure for a European Central Bank and one European currency(stepping-stone). And the concept of Europe with centralised controladministered by a European Central Bank, one currency, regional administrationand common labour, transport and industrial policies, is exactly what Hitler andthe Nazis planned for Europe. They even called their plan the European EconomicCommunity (Europäische Wirtschaft = gemeinschaft).27In his 1966 book, Tragedy And Hope, Elite ‘insider’ Carroll Quigley explainedhow the process of European integration on all levels was to be achieved instages; Richard N. Gardner (Comm 300) of the CFR was later to say how the planwas to “erode it [sovereignty] piece by piece”.28 On November 9th 1988, theEuropean leaders gathered at the Pantheon in Paris to celebrate the centenary ofthe birth of Jean Monnet, the man called ‘the father of Europe’. But what wasthere to celebrate about Monnet’s creation? It has kept the peace in Europesince 1945? No, no. The Elite has allowed that to happen so European integrationcould take place. Without the manipulators there would have been no pan-Europeanwars in this century, anyway. Monnet created a monster which is in the processof devouring freedom. The integration of Europe is another major vehicle for theNew World Order.The Bilderberg Group (BIL)29The creation of the European Community and the Bilderberg Group are linked byone man in particular, the Polish socialist, Joseph Retinger, a founder of theEuropean Movement and fellow conspirator with Jean Monnet. It was Retinger andPrince Bernhard of the Netherlands who suggested regular meetings of Europeanforeign ministers. Out of these meetings came the customs union known as theBenelux Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxemburg), a forerunner to theEuropean Community. Appropriately, it was in a speech at Chatham House to theRoyal Institute of International Affairs that Retinger set out his vision of aEurope in which countries would ‘relinquish part of their sovereignty’.30 InLondon he met Averell Harriman, then US Ambassador to England. Harriman arrangedfor him to visit the United States to gather support for the Independent Leaguefor Economic Cooperation, also known sometimes as the Economic League forEuropean Cooperation, which Retinger was organising. In America, Retinger (inhis own words) enjoyed widespread approval for his plans from Russel C.Leffingwell, senior partner in the J.P. Morgan bank and official of the CFR;David Rockefeller, the CFR chairman from 1946-53; Nelson Rockefeller (CFR); SirWilliam Wiseman (Comm 300), partner in Kuhn, Loeb, the Rothschild company;George Franklin, the CFR executive director from 1953-71 and an ‘in law’ to theRockefeller family; John Foster Dulles, and many other familiar characters.31 Bythis time, Retinger had already formed the American Committee on a United Europewith Allen Dulles, the first head of the CIA, and William Donovan, the head ofthe CIAs predecessor, the OSS.32From these and other discussions came the idea of a grouping of leadingpoliticians, political advisors, media owners and executives, multinationalcompany and banking executives, military leaders, and educationalists, who wouldmeet to decide the future of the world. It would become known as the BilderbergGroup, named after the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, wherethe first meeting took place from May 29th to 31st 1954. At the heart of theBilderberg Group’s formation were the Rothschilds and people like Retinger,Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Paul Rykens (the chairman of the soap andfood giant, Unilever), and that man again, Averell Harriman. The influence ofHarriman on this century can hardly be overstated, although most people willnever have even heard of him. It was Harriman who arranged the lend-leasesupplies to Britain and the Soviet Union; was the leading administrator of theMarshall Plan in Europe (which directed the policies of recipient countries);introduced the defence budget procedures with Jean Monnet and the British civilservant, Edwin Plowden, for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) whichare still used today; headed the Mutual Security Administration which rearmedEurope during the Cold War. This was the man whose family businesses supportedthe emergence of Adolf Hitler and the eugenics movement.Prince Bernhard, the former German SS officer, German spy via the I.G. FarbenCompany,33 and later a major shareholder with Lord Victor Rothschild in ShellOil, went to America to arrange the US membership of the Bilderberg Group.Prince Bernhard was born in 1911 as the German Prince of Lupp-Biesterfeld andlater worked for I.G. Farben’s ‘NW7’ intelligence department. He marriedPrincess Juliana (Comm 300) of the Netherlands in 1937. They were exiled toLondon after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands and this ‘former’ Germanintelligence operative worked as a top military liaison with allied forces.34The man who persuaded Bernhard to be the frontman for the Bilderbergers was thatarch manipulator…Lord Victor Rothschild. The annual meeting of theAnglo-European-American Elite known as the Bilderberg Group was to become a keycomponent in the Elite network which forms the secret government of the worldtoday. Among those who attended that first meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel in1954 were David Rockefeller (CFR); Dean Rusk (CFR, TC, Rhodes Scholar), the headof the Rockefeller Foundation and Secretary of State under John F. Kennedy;Joseph E. Johnson (CFR), head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peaceand the US Secretary of the Bilderbergers; Denis Healey (TC, RIIA, Comm 300),the British Labour Party Minister of Defence from 1964–1970 and Chancellor ofthe Exchequer 1974–1979; Hugh Gaitskell, the future leader of the British LabourParty before his death in the early 60s; and Lord Boothby, who worked withWinston Churchill on the unification of Europe.35 Denis Healey has attended moreBilderberg meetings since 1954 than any other United Kingdom politician. He alsobecame chairman of another Elite creation, the International Monetary FundInterim Committee, and he was given a grant by the Ford Foundation36 to launchthe Elite’s Institute of Strategic Studies, which began operating in London in1958.37 For 12 years, Healey, a leading member of the Fabian Society, served onthe council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs and became a memberof the Rockefellers’ Trilateral Commission in 1979.The Bilderberg Group consists of a small core elite, known as the SteeringCommittee. This is unelected and was headed by Prince Bernhard, a close friendof the British Royal Family. He remained chairman until he resigned in 1976 whenhe was implicated in the Lockheed bribery scandal. Lord Home (Comm 300), theformer British Prime Minister, took over as chairman and since 1991 that posthas been held by Lord Carrington. He is an extremely close associate of HenryKissinger. Carrington is a former British cabinet minister, secretary general ofNATO, member of the Committee of 300, and current President of the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs. Peter Rupert Carrington comes from a familywhich made its money from banking. Carrington was on the board of Hambros Bank(Comm 300 designate) which has been linked with the Michel Sindona financialscandal in Italy. This was, in turn, connected with the infamous P2 FreemasonryLodge which blew Italian politics apart. Among Lord Carrington’s other businessinterests have been directorships at Rio Tinto Zinc, Barclay’s Bank, CadburySchweppes, Amalgamated Metal, British Metal, Christies (the auctioneers), andthe chairmanship of the Australian New Zealand Bank.In his book, The English Rothschilds, Richard Davis reports that LionelRothschild was a frequent visitor to the Carrington’s home in Whitehall. The twofamilies are related by the marriage of the fifth Earl Rosebery to HannahRothschild, daughter of Mayer, in 1878. During the ceremony, she was given away,as the British say, by Prime Minister Disraeli. The Bilderberg Elite, likeCarrington and those on the steering committee, coordinate the regular attendersof Bilderberg meetings (who know the real game plan) and those invited on a rareor one-time basis (who may not know the true agenda of the organisation, but canbe fed the party line that world institutions are the way to peace andprosperity). The Elite are also very efficient manipulators of the ego and manypoliticians feel themselves to have ‘arrived’ on the international stage if theyare invited to attend.The Bilderberg Group meets once a year and always in the strictest secrecy. Thehotels are cleared of everyone except the Bilderbergers and hotel staff. Themeetings discuss the strategy required over the following twelve months tofurther the goals of the New World Order, and it cooperates with associatedorganisations. Not a word of the discussions is allowed to be reported in themainstream press. This, despite the attendance of major media figures likeKatharine Graham (Bil, CFR, TC), the present owner of the Washington Post, andConrad Black (Bil, TC), the owner of the Hollinger Group which controls theLondon Daily Telegraph, the Jerusalem Post, the Spectator, and scores of othermedia organisations around the world. Graham is also co-chairman (with ArthurOchs Sulzberger of the New York Times) in the jointly-produced InternationalHerald Tribune, another propaganda sheet for the Global Elite. Graham is furtherconnected with Newsweek magazine and the news agency, Associated Press (AP),which feeds information to countless media outlets around the world; notinformation about the Bilderberg Group, however, or the CFR or TrilateralCommission.Three board members of Black’s Hollinger empire, and/or the Daily Telegraph, areHenry Kissinger, Lord Carrington, and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild. Black has servedon the Bilderberg Steering Committee. His Hollinger Group has an interestinghistory. It was formerly known as the Argus Corporation which evolved from acompany set up by the elite British intelligence unit of World War II, theSpecial Operations Executive, thanks to the leading economic warfare expert,Edward Plunket Taylor. He was a business partner of George Montegu Black,Conrad’s father. Both were involved in brewing in Canada and their riseparalleled that of the Bronfmans, the family of a Canadian gangster of theprohibition period. Today the Bronfmans are closely connected with thatnotorious Elite organisation, the Anti-Defamation League. In 1940, EdwardPlunket Taylor was personally appointed by Winston Churchill to the SpecialOperations Executive. His cover was to chair a private company called WarSupplies Ltd, which was created by the SOE. Taylor and George Montegu Black madea vast fortune through this company and it continued after the war as the ArgusCorporation, now the Hollinger Group. Taylor left in 1970 to draft the bankinglaws for the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas which, as a result, became“offshore” havens for dodgy money. Under Conrad Black’s stewardship, a stream ofBilderbergers and other names mentioned in this book have been appointed to theboard of Telegraph newspapers and the Hollinger Group. Great to know we have afree press, eh?Another member of the Bilderberg Steering Committee is Andrew Knight, the formerexecutive on the Economist, Black’s Daily Telegraph, and later the executivechairman of Rupert Murdoch’s News International which, in Britain, owns the Sun,Today, the News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times. Knight is still on theboard of that organisation. Since 1982, he has been part of the Council ofManagement of the Ditchley Foundation, based at Ditchley Park, near Oxford, in acastle built for the Earl of Lichfield in the sixteenth century. The DitchleyFoundation was given the property by Ronald and Marietta Tree. Ronald was aformer high flyer in British Intelligence.38 The steering committee of theBilderberg Group often holds its monthly meetings at the castle. The DitchleyFoundation is a New World Order front organisation which works closely with theTavistock Institute for Human Relations in London, which a number of researchersand published works have claimed is a centre for the study of mass mindmanipulation. Several of the names mentioned in this book are connected withDitchley including Christopher (Lord) Tugendhat, the chairman of the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs. The American branch of the DitchleyFoundation is run by Cyrus Vance (CFR, TC, Bil, Comm 300), secretary of stateunder Carter and a director of the Rockefeller Foundation. The number ofjournalists and media executives in the Bilderberg Group and in other strands inthe network is very substantial, but try finding a word about these meetings inthe mainstream media.Behind the Bilderbergers are the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Today HenryKissinger is a major manipulator, albeit as a puppet of those who really controlhim. Kissinger is an elite member of the Bilderberg Group, the TrilateralCommission, and the Council on Foreign Relations, and he is connected with theRoyal Institute of International Affairs, the Rockefeller/Rothschild ChaseManhattan Bank, and the Rockefeller Foundation. He also runs his ownorganisation, Kissinger Associates, among whose founding directors you willfind…Lord Carrington! Kissinger and Carrington have close connections with LordRoll of Ipsden, another Bilderberger, Trilateralist, member of the Committee of300, and board member of Kissinger Associates. Lord Roll (formerly Sir EricRoll) was the president of the merchant bank, S.G. Warburg. Another close friendof Kissinger in England was British Intelligence operative and spy, Lord VictorRothschild.The Spotlight newspaper in Washington (which seeks to publish material that themainstream media will not report) is constantly seeking to infiltrate Bilderbergmeetings. It had a good year in 1991 when it obtained the guest list of themeeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. Among the names were David Rockefeller and astream of US administrators, politicians, and company heads. Bill Clinton wasthere, then as governor for Arkansas, but he was soon to be President of theUnited States. Clinton is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations andthe Trilateral Commission, two of many things this Democrat shares with hispredecessor in the White House, the Republican, George Bush. Conrad Black wasthere, as always, and so was another elite Bilderberger, the longtime head ofFiat, Giovanni Agnelli (Comm 300). He is the richest and most powerful figure inItalian society with interests in banking, insurance, chemicals, textiles,armaments and publishing, reputed to be worth $60 billion. His publishing empireincludes two of the three leading newspapers in Italy, La Stampa and Corrieredela Sera. I bet they don’t mention that their owner is a leading voice in theBilderberg Group. Henry Kissinger described him as “one of the people in thisworld I like the most”.39European royalty was represented by two regular attenders, Queen Beatrix of theNetherlands (Comm 300), the daughter of Prince Bernhard, and Queen Sophia ofSpain. The British delegation included John Smith,40 the late leader of theLabour Party, who was also a Trilateralist; Gordon Brown, the shadow LabourChancellor; Andrew Knight; Lord Roll of Ipsden; Lawrence Freedman, the head ofthe Department of War Studies at Kings College; Christopher Hogg, the chairmanof Courtaulds; and Patrick Wright, the Permanent Undersecretary of State andhead of the Diplomatic Service. Manfred Wörner, the late secretary general ofNATO, was there and so was John R. Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander Europeat SHAPE headquarters. Galvin has been an advocate of NATO operations outsideits official sphere of influence. The secretary general of NATO is a Bilderbergappointment. Most, if not all, of them have been Bilderbergers. In more recenttimes, the Bilderberger Joseph Luns, was replaced by Lord Carrington, who wasfollowed by Manfred Wörner, and after his death in 1994, he was replaced byanother regular Bilderberger, Willy Claes, the Belgian Foreign Minister (who hassince been questioned by Belgian police investigating corruption). The latesthead of NATO, the Spaniard, Javier Solana (Bil), has been constantly pressingthe Bilderberg Group agenda for a European army, the expansion of NATO into theformer Soviet Union, and for NATO to operate outside its designated area.According to The Spotlight, the introduction of the world army was high on theagenda in Baden-Baden, with Henry Kissinger saying in one of his Bilderbergforums:> “A UN army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without> delays involved in each country making its own decisions based on parochial> considerations.”41And, of course, Henry, if there just happened to be lots of conflicts in whichUN Peacekeeping Forces were exposed as inadequate and ineffective as in Bosnia,Rwanda, etc, the public outcry could be met with: “Well, if you will just agreeto give the UN Forces more powers, they could respond quicker and be aseffective as you want them to be”. Problem-reaction-solution. Kissinger alsosaid he was delighted with the way George Bush was able to declare war on Iraqby going direct to the United Nations when under the US Constitution, onlyCongress was allowed to declare war. If Americans could be persuaded tosurrender warmaking decisions to the UN and let their young men die wearing a UNuniform, fighting under a UN flag, ‘parochial nationalism’ in Britain, France,and elsewhere would disappear, Bilderberg speakers said, according to Spotlightinformants. Bill Clinton has pressed for just such a policy in Bosnia and wewill see further efforts to do this with other UN operations.The same old names which keep coming up everywhere attended the June 1994Bilderberg meeting in Finland. Among the invited high and mighty was Peter D.Sutherland (TC, Comm 300), the Director General of GATT, the General Agreementon Tariff and Trade, which is an Elite front to bring down trade barriers andput all countries at the mercy of the Elite-controlled world economic system.Sutherland was a perfect choice for the job as a former member of the Commissionof the European Community. He was a Bilderberger before he became head of worldtrade. His successor as the top man at the World Trade Organisation, theItalian, Renato Ruggiero, is also a Bilderberger. Another regular Bilderberger,the Netherlands Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, was also there in Finland, alongwith bankers like J. Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Barclays Bank. Twoother names of significance to British voters are Tony Blair (Labour) andKenneth Clarke (Conservative). They attended the 1993 Bilderberg meeting inVouliagment, Greece, where David Owen (TC) spoke about Yugoslavia and the futureof Europe. Tony Blair, then the opposition home affairs spokesman, went on tobecome Labour leader and prime minister, while Kenneth Clarke would become theChancellor of the Exchequer. Both support a federal Europe.In June 1995, the Bilderberg Group met at three exclusive hotels, The Grand, ThePark, and The Palace, on a mountainside at Burgenstock in Switzerland. It was arare occasion when they met in the same place twice. Coincidentally, I was onholiday in Switzerland when the Bilderbergers gathered and I was told of themeeting by Spotlight newspaper only a few days before I arrived. I went toBurgenstock before the meeting and again on their final day of discussions. Whata difference the second time!The roads and paths to the hotels were blocked by Swiss police and the militarymanned lookout posts across the mountain. All this for a private meeting of anorganisation that operates outside the ‘democratic’ process.I asked a policeman at a road block what was going on. All he could reply was“top secret, top secret”. He knew no more than that. It was a bizarre situation.I could have told the policeman what he was guarding, but he didn’t know! Itillustrated brilliantly the way the global pyramid operates. The policemanappeared to be a very nice man. No doubt he had children and grandchildren andhe had no desire to leave them a global fascist state. But there he was on aSwiss mountainside playing his part, unknowingly, in shielding from the publicglare, the very people who are plotting to create just such a worlddictatorship.The European-Atlantic Group (EAG) and The Atlantic Council (AC)In 1954, the year the Bilderberg Group was founded, another organisation cameinto being, the European-Atlantic Group. Its headquarters are at 6 GertrudeStreet, Chelsea, London. The group was formed by the late Lord Layton, who wasthen Vice-President of the Council of Europe and it brings together members ofparliament from all parties, industrialists, bankers, economists, andjournalists (sound familiar?) to promote closer relations between the “Europeanand Atlantic countries by providing a regular forum in Britain for informeddiscussion of their problems and possibilities for better economic and politicalcooperation with each other and with the rest of the world”.42 This means, touse its own words, connecting with international organisations, including TheCouncil of Europe, NATO, OECD, the Western European Union, the European Union,the European Free Trade Association, the GATT global ‘free’ trade organisation,and the Economic Commission for Europe. And, it might add, any organisationwhich desires a world government or can be used to that end. Its hierarchy isdominated by the House of Lords and includes a representative of the AmericanNew World Order front, the Council on Foreign Relations. Among thevice-presidents on the list I have from the 1990s are: Lord Carrington, chairmanof the Bilderberg Group; Lord Chalfont, chairman of the House of Lords DefenceCommittee; Graham Dowson, joint president of the European League for EuropeanCooperation; Douglas Fairbanks, the Council on Foreign Relations; Lord Gladwyn,president of the European Movement; Robert Maxwell (deceased), embezzler, Mossadagent, and publisher of the Daily Mirror newspaper; Sir David Nicholson,chairman of the European Movement; Derek Prag, chairman of the London EuropeSociety; Lord Pym, who took over as foreign secretary from Lord Carrington atthe time of the Falklands War; and Lord Shawcross.The Atlantic Council (formerly the British Atlantic Council) is a similarorganisation, even down to many of the personnel. Its vice-presidents include:Lord Carrington; Lord Gladwyn; Lord Pym; Lord Shawcross; the Earl ofBessborough, a past president of the European-Atlantic Group; Lord Home, formerConservative prime minister, and past chairman of the Bilderberg Group; EdwardHeath, former Conservative prime minister, Bilderberger, Trilateralist, andobsessively in favour of European union; Denis Healey; William Rogers,Bilderberger, former Labour minister, and one of the ‘gang of four’ who formedthe breakaway Social Democratic Party, now the Liberal Democrats.If the Royal Institute of International Affairs were not so shy about itsmembership list, you would find many names active within these two organisationsinvolved at the RIIA also, I’m sure. The European Atlantic Group and theAtlantic Council are both part of the New World Order network.The Trilateral Commission43The next element of the secret government network was unveiled in 1972–1973 byDavid Rockefeller (Comm 300), the head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, leadingBilderberger, and leading manipulator of the Council on Foreign Relations, ofwhich he was the long-time chairman. David Rockefeller is one of the most highprofile, and most obvious, New World Order manipulators on the planet, althoughhe is really a puppet of those above him in the pyramid. He created theTrilateral Commission which, as its name suggests, is made up of three groupings– the United States, Europe, and Japan. Rockefeller was partly inspired to dothis by Zbigniew Brzezinski (TC, CFR, Bil), a professor at the Elite-controlledColumbia University. Brzezinski had also been researching the need forUS-Europe-Japan cooperation at the Elite-controlled ‘think tank’, the BrookingsInstitute in Washington.Brzezinski wrote a book called Between Two Ages: America’s Role In TheTechnetronic Era, in which he described a new society “…that is shapedculturally, psychologically, socially, and economically by the impact oftechnology and electronics – particularly in the area of computers andcommunication”.44 He said in the book that “national sovereignty is no longer aviable concept” and suggested the movement, in stages, “toward a largercommunity of the developed nations… through a variety of indirect ties andalready developing limitations on national sovereignty”. In 1990, he wrote inthe Elite’s mouthpiece, the New York Times, that Europe should follow a policy“founded upon the grand concept of a trans-European commonwealth with theEuropean Community at its core, but embracing Central Europe and being open alsoto eventual association with the Soviet Union”. You can see where this guy iscoming from. David Rockefeller was so impressed with Brzezinski that he made himdirector of the Trilateral Commission, which recruited members from all areas ofinfluence and power in the United States, Europe and Japan. Many of thoserecruited were already members of the Council on Foreign Relations; some wereBilderbergers, too, and others, like Henry Kissinger, were linked to all of themand the Royal Institute of International Affairs as well. Among the seventeenpeople who met at the Rockefellers’ estate (Pocantico Hills in Tarrytown, NewYork) to plan the Trilateral Commission on July 23rd and 24th 1972, were C. FredBergsten (CFR, Bil), Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute and a formerAssistant for International Economic Affairs to Henry Kissinger; and McGeorgeBundy (CFR, Bil), the President of the Ford Foundation and head of the NationalSecurity Council under both John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The early fundingfor the Trilateral Commission came from David Rockefeller, the Ford Foundation,the Kettering Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund,and the Thyssen Foundation, with smaller amounts donated by organisations likeGeneral Motors, Exxon, Coca Cola, Time magazine, CBS, and the Wells FargoBank.45 The Commission made its headquarters at 345 East 46th Street, New York.One of the first ambitions for David Rockefeller and his Trilateral Commissionwas to put a commission member in the White House as President of the UnitedStates as soon as possible. He achieved this at the next election when JimmyCarter, the Democrat peanut farmer from Georgia, beat Gerald Ford. Carter wasselected for president by Rockefeller and Brzezinski and the whole Elite networkof money, media, and dirty tricks were used to ensure he was elected. Carter wasanother puppet president controlled by the Elite. His speeches in his electioncampaign were written by Brzezinski and none could have been more insulting tothe truth than his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination. In the worldof politics you don’t tell people what you stand for; you tell them what theywant you to stand for. When you look at Carter’s background, what greaterexample of this could there be than when he spoke of:> “…a political and economic elite who have shaped decisions and never had to> account for mistakes nor to suffer from injustice. When unemployment prevails,> they never stand in line looking for a job. When deprivation results from a> confused welfare system, they never do without food or clothing, or a place to> sleep. When the public schools are inferior or torn by strife their children> go to exclusive private schools. And when the bureaucracy is bloated and> confused, the powerful always manage to discover and occupy niches of special> influence and privilege.” 46Sure, Jimmy, sure. He might have added at the end…“And quite right, too”.Carter’s administration was awash with Trilateral Commission members. Among itsranks were Walter Mondale, the vice president; Cyrus Vance, the secretary ofstate; Warren Christopher, the deputy secretary of state; Harold Brown (CFR),secretary for defense; W. Michael Blumenthal (CFR), secretary of the treasury;C. Fred Bergsten (CFR, Bil), assistant secretary of the treasury forinternational affairs; Henry Owen (CFR), the ambassador-at-large and thepresident’s special representative for economic summits; Paul C. Warnke (CFR),chief disarmament negotiator; Andrew Young (CFR), ambassador to the UnitedNations, Paul A. Volcker (CFR, Bil), chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,and…Zbigniew Brzezinski (CFR, Bil), Carter’s national security advisor. This wasthe Trilateral Administration. It became a standing joke among insiders thatwhenever Carter was faced with a decision or document involving foreign policy,he would say “Clear it with Brzezinski” or “Has Brzezinski seen this?” 47 PaulVolcker was made head of the Federal Reserve by Carter on the instructions ofDavid Rockefeller. It is one of the most influential posts in the Elite network,with its power to control the American economy. Volcker became the NorthAmerican chairman of the Trilateral Commission and was both a Bilderberger andmember of the Council on Foreign Relations. He remained chairman of the ‘Fed’until he was replaced during the Reagan administration by the present incumbent,Alan Greenspan, who is also a member of the TC, CFR, and Bilderberg Group. Justa coincidence, naturally.The Trilateral Commission’s influence became worldwide with its membershipacross the American, European and Japanese elites. Ireland was well representedon the executive committee of the TC in Europe through both Prime MinisterGarret Fitzgerald (Bil) and the then little known Mary Robinson, who would go onto be the first woman President of Ireland. After I had spoken about thesematters in a meeting at Totnes in South West England, a lady in the audiencesought me out. “That’s the first time I have heard anyone talk about this sincemy husband (who worked for the South African government) showed me a documentwhich said that the Trilateral Commission had ordered Britain to pull out ofRhodesia”, she said. The lady, like most people in the world, had never heard ofthe Trilateral Commission at the time she saw the document. Who was the BritishForeign Secretary at that time, I thought, during the administration of MargaretThatcher (Bil), when Britain left Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe? It was…LordCarrington, Bilderberger and member of the Trilateral Commission. He wascontinuing a policy put into motion by the previous Labour government of JimCallaghan (Bil), now a president, along with Lord Carrington and Lord Jenkins(TC, Bil), of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. And who wasCallaghan’s foreign secretary? David Owen, a soon-to-be member of the TrilateralCommission who worked closely with Andrew Young, Jimmy Carter’s ambassador atthe United Nations, and member of the Trilateral Commission. I remembered alsothat when the European Community sent an ‘ambassador’ to negotiate ‘peace’ inBosnia, they chose…Lord Carrington. When he ‘failed’, they sent…David Owen.Later an ‘independent’ peace negotiator arrived on the scene from America –Jimmy Carter. And, I thought, who was foreign secretary when the policies weredecided that led to the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982?Lord Carrington. He resigned over what happened and was rewarded with the job ofsecretary general of NATO! Also deeply involved in the negotiations overRhodesia and the transition from white dictatorship to dictatorship by RobertMugabe, was Lord Soames, a director of N.M. Rothschild until 1979. I’m sure thatall these coincidences must have an innocent explanation. Its just that I can’tthink of one.The Club of Rome and the Environmental MovementThe Club of Rome was launched publicly in 1968 by the Italian Freemason, AurelioPeccei (Comm 300), who once said to his friend, the former US Secretary ofState, Alexander Haig (TC), that he felt like Adam Weishaupt reincarnated.48Weishaupt was the man behind the modern Illuminati. Peccei was the chiefexecutive of the Fiat Motor Company under its president and prominentBilderberger, Giovanni Agnelli (Comm 300). The Club of Rome was created bymeetings at the Rockefeller family’s private estate at Bellagio in Italy.49 Itwas, and is, the Club of Rome’s role to issue propaganda about the environmentalcrisis and use this to justify the centralisation of power(problem-reaction-solution) and the suppression of industrial development inboth the West and the so called Third World. It is also another ‘justification’for population control (eugenics). Peccei was a passionate advocate of worldgovernment and his Club of Rome has produced plans for restructuring the worldinto five regions under the control of a central world authority. It has issuedmany ‘reports’, including Limits To Growth in 1972, sponsored by theRockefellers. It was distributed as a 197-page paperback published in 18editions and 23 languages. Limits To Growth has been widely quoted by theenvironmental movement to support their arguments, but they should consider thefact that anything that comes out of the Club of Rome is part of an Elite planto direct human thinking and persuade people to accept the goals of the NewWorld Order. So is the Club’s “spiritual/arts” offshoot, the Club of Budapest,headed by Ervin Laszio, an associate of Aurelio Peccei. They might consider,too, the fact that Peccei later admitted that the computer used to produce theirdata and justification had been preprogrammed to produce the desired result. Hesaid this had been done because nations required ‘shock treatment’ if they wereto accept population control.50 The acclaimed economist, Gunnar Myrdal, said ofthe Club of Rome methods:> “The use of mathematical equations and a huge computer, which registers the> alternatives of abstractly conceived policies by a ‘world simulation model’,> may impress the innocent general public but has little, if any, scientific> validity. That this ‘sort of model is actually a new tool for mankind’ is> unfortunately not true. It represents quasilearnedness of a type that we have,> for a long time, had too much of…” 51It was under the influence and guidance of the Club of Rome and its ‘data’ thatanother report was produced which has had a fundamental effect on theacceleration of ‘environmentalism’. This was a study ordered by the TrilateralCommission-controlled Carter administration. On July 24th 1980, in the lastmonths of the Carter presidency, his secretary of state, Edmund Muskie (TC,CFR), presented the Global 2000 report to the President. It painted a globalpicture of overpopulation, resource and food shortages, and environmentaldangers which, it estimated, would cause the deaths of at least 170 millionpeople up to the year 2000. This was followed six months later by anotherreport, Global Future: A Time To Act, the work of the White House Council onEnvironmental Quality. This called for a series of measures to respond to thecrisis set out in Global 2000 and at the top of the list of responseswas…population control through sterilisation and other means. Both reportscalled for, in effect, the restriction of scientific development andtechnological transfer to developing countries and soon these policies werebeing lauded around the world. Cyrus Vance (TC, CFR, Bil, Comm 300), Carter’ssecretary of state before Muskie, chaired the Committee for the Year 2000 forthis purpose. Vance was the man who instigated both Global 2000 and GlobalFuture during his tenure at Carter’s State Department. In his first officialspeech at the United Nations in 1977, Vance rejected calls from developingcountries for changes to the International Monetary Fund and the unfairness ofthe economic system, and instead he suggested a “…new world order based onenvironmentalism”.I would have more confidence in the problems and solutions presented by the Clubof Rome and these two US reports if the people behind them were not the verysame politicians, bankers, industrialists, and academics who support and promotethe policies of the Elite-controlled International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bank ofInternational Settlements, and World Bank, which in turn, are responsible forthe death, starvation, and suffering of billions of people across the planet.One of the architects of the Global 2000 Report was Robert McNamara (TC, CFR,Bil), a former president of the World Bank, the policies of which have wreakedenvironmental and human genocide in the Third World! I would have moreconfidence if these ‘environmental messiahs’ were not the same people whosuppress the introduction of known technologies, such as free energytechnology,52 which could in a few years replace today’s fossil-fuel-burningenvironmental carnage. I differ from those who say there is no environmentalcrisis and that the whole thing is a propaganda creation. I think we areinflicting appalling wounds to Planet Earth and if we go on as we are there willbe serious consequences, indeed there already are. What I feel, however, is thatthese wounds are being knowingly inflicted by the Elite, and no doubt in certainareas, exaggerated for propaganda purposes to create yet another globalproblem-reaction-solution scenario.If those behind all this really cared about the environment and the lives ofthose who suffer so terribly from the present system, they would be releasingthe suppressed technologies which would dramatically reduce the damage which isbeing wreaked upon the Earth. Reports like Global 2000, Global Future, and thoseproduced by the Elite/Club of Rome, base their findings on what they call‘current trends’. But what are ‘current trends’? They are only the result of thecurrent policies of the Elite manipulators. Change the policies and you changeboth the ‘trends’ and the recommendations on how to react to the ‘trends’. Therape of the Third World environment creates dependency by billions of people onthe Elite-controlled economic system, as their ability to live sustainablywithout outside ‘support’ is destroyed. Environmental damage is thereforeterrible for the mass of humanity, but an excellent tool for the Elite’sambitions. Change these policies and change the ‘trends’(environmentally-created dependency) and you make irrelevant the ‘solutions’suggested in Club of Rome reports. But funnily enough, such reports never callfor an end to Elite policies, because these publications are part of them.Most environmentalists are genuinely campaigning for what they believe to beright, but there are some who are knowingly working to the New World Orderagenda and I must say I am less than convinced when I hear people like Al Gore(CFR), the vice president to Bill Clinton (TC, CFR, Bil), being presented as an‘environmentalist’. I would take his concern for the environment and humanity alittle more seriously if he had not been one of the Democrats who voted withGeorge Bush’s Republicans in favour of the war in the Gulf in 1991, and had hisenvironmental policies not come straight off the pages of Club of Rome andGlobal 2000 reports. I was an environmental campaigner throughout the 1980s andbecame a national spokesman for the British Green Party, so I can see how manyof the responses of the environmental movement resulted from the Club of Rome,Global 2000, approach to both problems and solutions. I am still anenvironmental campaigner, but now from a much, much, wider perspective and I canappreciate how the ‘green movement’ is being manipulated to promote the NewWorld Order. When, for instance, the green movement presents wind power and wavepower as alternative forms of energy to fossil fuels, this so lacks credibilitythat there appears to be no choice but to continue to exploit the planet andcreate pollution. This is helping to obscure the fact that free energytechnology exists. I can also see today how the pressure for population controlis, and always has been, promoted by the Elite to justify a policy of eugenics.The theme of these various environmental reports is that economic growth mustend, something with which much of the environmental movement would agree. Sowould I, in fact. As with everything, I feel, we need to look at the shades ofgrey if we are to find the truth of any situation. On one side you have theenvironmentalists who challenge growth and on the other you have some of thosewho are investigating the New World Order conspiracy, who say the environmentalproblems are all a hoax. I see the truth in the middle somewhere. Yes, there areenvironmental problems, but the questions we need to ask are these: Have theenvironmental problems been created deliberately, largely to produce a situationof problem-reaction-solution? And are at least aspects of the ‘environmentalcrisis’ being deliberately emphasised and exaggerated to quicken theproblem-reaction-solution response by the public? I believe the answer to bothquestions is yes.We can look in the same way at economic growth. Some say it has to stop, somesay there are no limits to growth. But what is growth? It is merely themeasurement of the amount of money that is spent for goods and services in anyyear. This figure is what we call Gross National Product (GNP) or Gross DomesticProduct (GDP). Therefore ‘growth’ is the sum total of all the positive andnegative events in the world every year that involve money being spent, that’sall. The money spent on improving the quality of people’s lives and that spenton wars, road accidents, and responding to oil tanker catastrophes are allmeasured exactly the same by this system, because all are adding to the economictally – GDP. This is plainly farcical. What we call growth tells us nothing,except how absurd our economic indicators are. When we speak of an end to growthor we say there are no limits to growth, we have to ask “What kind of growth?And the growth of what?” Of course there are limits to growth if you are talkingabout the constant expansion of what we take from the planet and throw at her inpollution. But, when the true understanding of physics and technology isrevealed and introduced in our everyday lives, we will see that this suppressedknowledge can give us the warmth and power we need for a comfortable life forall the peoples of the world without dismantling the planet. Under this system,the growth in take-make-and-throwaway and mine-burn-pollute can slow down andend, while – at the same time – everyone in the world has a better, not a moreprimitive standard of life. The end to growth in take-make-and-throwaway and theexpansion of better living conditions for all are not a contradiction. They aremade possible by ending the suppression of scientific knowledge that will solvethe environmental and human ‘problems’ which have been engineered to control us.What is clear is that the use of environmentalism to justify centralised controlcontinues apace. Working to this end alongside the Club of Rome is the UnitedNations. In February 1972, an advertisement sponsored by theRockefeller/CFR-controlled World Association of World Federalists53 appeared inThe Humanist, the magazine of the American Humanist (this-world-is-all-there-is)Association. Note the use of words like problem and solution. It said:> “World Federalists believe that the environmental crisis facing Planet Earth> is a global problem and therefore calls for a ‘global’ solution – a worldwide> United Nations Environmental Agency with the power to make decisions stick.> WAWF has submitted a proposal for just such an agency to be considered at the> 1972 UN Environmental Conference to be held in Stockholm.”The timing is interesting here. 1972 was the year of the publication of the Clubof Rome’s Limits To Growth report. The troops were being gathered for thebattle. It was a battle to persuade the public that there was a globalenvironmental problem in need of a global – centralised – solution. The momentumgenerated from that UN Environmental Conference led to just such anEnvironmental Agency, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The first executivedirector was a Canadian, Maurice Strong (Comm 300), a millionaire oilman andformer trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He had been the secretary-generalof the Stockholm conference and is a major voice in the Club of Rome. Strong andDavid Rockefeller wrote the foreword for a Trilateral Commission book, BeyondInterdependence: The Meshing Of The World’s Economy And The Earth’s Ecology.54Among the co-authors was Strong’s friend and fellow Canadian, Jim MacNeill, whohad advised him at Stockholm. They were also both members of the WorldCommission on Environment and Development and MacNeill, as secretary general ofthat organisation, played a leading role in writing the report called Our CommonFuture, another tome constantly quoted by the environmental movement. It is alsoknown as The Brundtland Report, after the prime minister of Norway, Gro HarlamBrundtland, who put her name to it. She is an enthusiastic supporter of theEuropean Union and population control measures. Her husband, Arne OlavBrundtland, is a Bilderberger.In 1992 came the much-heralded United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,Brazil, which brought together the heads of world governments and the best knownenvironmentalists, such as Britain’s Jonathan Porritt, the former head of UKFriends of the Earth and now advisor to Prince Charles. The secretary general ofthe Rio Summit was, well I never, …Maurice Strong, David Rockefeller’s greenfriend. Strong was advised by Rockefeller’s other green buddy…Jim MacNeill.Beyond Interdependence, the Trilateral Commission’s environmental offering, waspublished in preparation for Rio, as was Global Economics And The Environment bythe Council on Foreign Relations. The theme was…centralisation of control toprotect the world. Maurice Strong is President of the World Federation of UnitedNations Associations, co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, and a member ofthe Club of Rome, among countless other bodies steeped in the New World Order.Strong is using the environment to justify centralisation of power.Another well-known green face behind the Rio Summit was Lester R. Brown, the‘anti-establishment’ head of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington. His dislikefor the establishment does not, however, prevent him being a member of the CFR.His Institute publishes the annual State Of The World reports detailing thedemise of the global environment. The 1989 version on my own bookshelf tells methat: “The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Winthrop Rockefeller Trust, and the GeorgeGund Foundation supply the backbone of financial support for the State of theWorld series”. I can’t claim to have been surprised. In his State Of The World1991, Brown said:> “…the battle to save the planet will replace the battle over ideology as the> organizating theme of the new world order…[with] the end of the ideological> conflict that dominated a generation of international affairs, a new world> order, shaped by a new agenda, will emerge.” 55There had obviously been a mobilisation by the Elite to speak with the samevoice and also to use those environmentalists – by no means all – who don’t knowthey are being manipulated. David Rockefeller (Comm 300), Henry Kissinger (Comm300), François Mitterand (Comm 300), Willy Brandt (Comm 300), Mikhail Gorbachev,and so many more all parroted the party line on the environment, which, putsuccinctly, was global crisis = global solution. Gorbachev, well-schooled by hisfriends Rockefeller and Kissinger, suddenly began to speak passionately of theenvironment. He said:> “The ecological crisis we are experiencing today – from ozone depletion to> deforestation and disastrous air pollution – is tragic but convincing proof> that the world we all live in is interrelated and interdependent. This means> that we need an appropriate international policy in the field of ecology. Only> if we formulate such a policy shall we be able to avert catastrophe. True, the> elaboration of such a policy poses unconventional and difficult problems that> will affect the sovereignty of states.” 56The New York Times columnist, Flora Lewis (CFR) welcomed Gorbachev’s call toinstigate a “plan for a global code of environmental conduct…[which would] havean aspect of world government, because it would provide for the World Court tojudge states”.57 The secret government network has so many members in the mediathat there is never a problem finding support for its manoeuvrings from thatdirection. There are environmental problems, most of them due to Elite policies,but be very careful before you accept the propaganda of the environmentalcentralisers. It’s your mind they are after. I would suggest that it is verymuch worth someone looking into the major funders of environmental organisationsand the background to their front people to see if any links with the Elitenetwork exist.The Club of Rome and Population ControlAnother sinister aspect of the Club of Rome and the super dupers planning theElite’s ‘green’ campaign is their use of the environment to promote populationcontrol – eugenics. It is plainly true, as the New World Order promoters say,that there is a limit to the number of human beings who can live on this planet.You can’t argue with that because when there is a human being for every squarefoot of the Earth, there will be clearly too many. So there are limits. Butagain we need to ask questions here. How many is too many? Would the comfortablecarrying capacity of the Earth be far greater if the industrial and bankingelite were not destroying the food-growing potential of the Third World and ifsuppressed scientific and technological understanding were made available toeveryone? Have the projected future numbers been purposely exaggerated tojustify a policy of global eugenics? The answers to those questions, I believe,are: more than we have now; yes; and yes. When you read the findings of the Clubof Rome publications and others like Global 2000, and you look at the peoplebehind them and their history of support for eugenics, its not hard toappreciate that these reports are really excuses for the culling of those areasof the world population considered to be of inferior stock, i.e. the non-whitepeoples and even those considered inferior among the whites. In politicallanguage it comes out something like this: “…the most fundamental pointunderlying all American foreign policy needs is overpopulation”.58 Those wordswere spoken by Robert McNamara (CFR, TC, Bil), one of the men behind the Global2000 report.At the centre of all this is again the name Rockefeller. In 1952, after decadesof funding and supporting eugenics, John D. Rockefeller III established hisPopulation Council, which still exists today. This Elite-front has been callingfor zero population growth in the United States and, in the words of its 1979annual report: “the spread of government-supported family planning programsthroughout the developing [ie. non-white] sector” and “the spread of the zeropopulation movement and the Club of Rome’s Malthusianism in the developedcountries”.59 Malthusianism is named after Thomas Robert Malthus, the guy Imentioned in the last chapter. He was a paid agent of the British East IndiaCompany, which inflicted opium on the Chinese. His population theories weredesigned to justify the need to keep down the lesser genetic stock, whom he sawas little more than animals. Officials of the Population Council were stronglyrepresented among the ‘outside consultants’ called in by the authors of Global2000 and Global Future.The head of the Global 2000 task force appointed by Cyrus Vance was Gerald O.Barney, the supervisor of another Rockefeller environment/population controlstudy, The Unfinished Agenda. Other agencies which supported the preparation ofthe report included The World Wildlife Fund,60 headed by Prince Philip (Bil) andbacked by Prince Charles (Bil), Prince Bernhard (Bil), and the Hapsburg Family;the Institute for World Order, created by C. Douglas Dillon under the directionof Bertrand Russell (Comm 300); and the Draper Fund-Population Crisis Committeeestablished by the eugenics promoter, William Draper; and the Elite-controlledAspen Institute. In 1965, an organisation inspired by the Council on ForeignRelations was launched called the Agenda 2000 group. This produced a reportco-authored by Zbigniew Brzezinski (TC, CFR, Bil) which called for an end topopulation growth in the Third World. The same year, George Ball (TC, CFR, Bil),the then Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs in the JohnsonAdministration, appointed a task force to investigate the ‘problem’ ofpopulation growth. Appointed to the task force, which later became the Office ofPopulation Affairs, were…Cyrus Vance (TC, CFR, Bil, Comm 300), who instigatedthe Global 2000 Report to the President, and Richard Gardner (TC, CFR, Comm 300)who would later become ambassador to Italy for Jimmy Carter and United Nationsadvisor to President Bill Clinton. Look how those demanding a New World Order ofcentralised global political and economic control are also those who wantpopulation control – eugenics. This is the thinking behind the Club of Rome andthe Global 2000 Report, which are so often quoted by the environmental movement!Wars have been used blatantly and without mercy to enforce population control innon-white countries. Two of the main US military commanders in Vietnam wereMaxwell Taylor and William Westmoreland, both members of the Population CrisisCommittee-Draper Fund and committed to population control. The genocide by PolPot in Cambodia was one of the most obvious examples of the culling of anon-white population. Millions died as an estimated 32 per cent of the Cambodianpopulation were murdered.61 There were many people responsible for this,including Henry Kissinger, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Kissinger, alegendary supporter of the Chinese communist regime, has been the key voice inAmerican-Chinese relations since the time of Richard Nixon. His attempts toundermine the established order were highlighted in 1969 when he and hispresident authorised the illegal bombing of Cambodia. They used the excuse thatthey were attacking North Vietnamese troops stationed there during the VietnamWar.This genocide was the subject of an article of impeachment against Nixon put tothe House Judiciary Committee in 1974 in the wake of Watergate, but it wasdefeated. Kissinger always claimed the Khmer Rouge were the agency of the NorthVietnamese when in fact Kissinger’s Red China was behind them. Using the excuseof attacking the Khmer Rouge to stop their assault on the Cambodian capital,Phnom Penh, the US forces launched a campaign of terror bombing on that country.Nearly 80,000 bombing sorties by B-52s and F-111s have been officially confirmedand they dropped 539,129 tons of explosives. The number of Cambodian dead isestimated at anything at between 30,000 and 500,000.62 But the biggest carnagewas still to come because the devastation caused by the Kissinger-Nixon policymade the takeover by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge inevitable. The US ‘ambassador’to Red China during this period, the man who communicated between the communistregime and his boss, Henry Kissinger, was George Bush.63 Cambodia was, at leastin part, about population culling, in my view.Kissinger took over from Averell Harriman as the ‘shuttle-diplomat’ of theElite. Kissinger is always flitting around, manipulating the Americanadministration and foreign governments. In 1969 he was head of both the StateDepartment and the National Security Council in the Nixon Administration. Nixonmay have been officially president, but Kissinger ran the government. At hissuggestion, Nixon named Laurance Rockefeller (TC, CFR, Bil) to lead a specialcommission on population growth. This recommended in 1972 that populationcontrol be introduced in America (i.e. among the ‘lesser’ stock). Afterdiscussions with the Club of Rome, of which he is a prominent member, Kissingerlater established two other population control organisations within thedepartments of government which he controlled with an iron fist. In the years1968 to 1977, the USAID programme for expenditure on health projects dropped by$40 million, while those directed at population control went up by $100 million.In 1974, Kissinger and the Rhodes Scholar, Brent Scowcroft (CFR, TC, Bil),supervised the production of the National Security Study Memorandum 200, calledImplications Of Worldwide Population Growth For US Security And OverseasInterests. It has now been declassified and reveals some of the true motivationsbehind America’s enthusiasm for population reduction in the developing world.Continued population growth in these regions, the document said, would increasetheir political, economic, and military power in a number of these countries andwould lead to an increase in demands for sovereign control of resources and toanti-imperial movements. This is a long-winded way of saying that thesecountries would wish to run their economies for their own benefit and notAmerica’s. Plans therefore had to be developed, it said, to remove opposition topopulation control. The countries the Kissinger-Scowcroft memorandum highlightedfor special attention were India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico,Indonesia, Brazil, the Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia, andColombia. Look at what has happened in these countries since 1974.In the Memorandum, Kissinger said that the truth behind the motivation forpopulation control had to be kept secret from the leaders of these countries:> “It is vital that the effort to develop and strengthen a commitment on the> part of less developed countries not be seen by them as an industrialised> country policy to keep their strength down or to reserve resources for use by> the ‘rich’ countries. Development of such a perception could create a serious> backlash adverse to the course of population stability.”In the early 70s, Kissinger asked the State Department’s Office of PopulationAffairs to produce a study targeting Central/South America and Africa. This led,to a considerable degree, to the engineering of ‘civil wars’ in the countries ofCentral America and Africa which have caused so much famine, death, andsuffering beyond imagination. It was a means to reduce the targeted populationof the world, as are designer diseases. The US-Kissinger (Elite) policy wasarticulated by Thomas Ferguson, the Latin American case officer for the Officeof Population Affairs. He said:> “There is a single theme in all our work – we must reduce population levels.> Either they [governments] do it our way, through nice clean methods, or they> will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in> Beirut [all Kissinger engineered]. Population is a political problem. Once> population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even> fascism, to reduce it. [Or rather, you need the ‘problem’ to justify fascism.]> “…The professionals aren’t interested in lowering population for humanitarian> reasons…We look at resource and environmental constraints. We look at our> strategic needs, and we say that this country must lower its population – or> else we will have trouble. So steps are taken. El Salvador is an example where> our failure to lower the population by simple means has created the basis for> a national security crisis. The government of El Salvador failed to use our> programmes to lower their population. Now they get a civil war because of it.> …There will be dislocation and food shortages. They still have too many people> there.” 64> > Some more of Mr Ferguson’s little gems include:> “To reduce the population quickly you have to pull all the males into the> fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age, females…> [Speaking of the civil war in El Salvador he said] You are killing a small> number of males and not enough fertile females to do the job on population…If> the war went on for 30 to 40 years like this, then you might accomplish> something. Unfortunately [sic], we don’t have too many instances like that to> study.” 65I know it’s horrible to know that anyone can see life in such terms, but MrFerguson is outlining very well the attitude of the Elite, its US StateDepartment, and the Club of Rome. When prominent environmentalists stand infront of crowds of non-white peoples in the Third World telling televisioncameras that we must have population control, they are helping the Elite’sagenda. Some will know that, many will not, but the effect is the same. I am infavour of all peoples having the choice not to conceive children if that istheir wish. Choice, however, is not a word the manipulators can spell. Againlook at the timing of the launch for so many of the population controlinitiatives by Kissinger and others: the late 60s and early 70s, just as theClub of Rome was getting started. Coinciding with the Club’s beginnings in 1968,came the book by Professor Paul R. Ehrlich, The Population Bomb, which has soldupwards of 20 million copies. In that he said:> “Our position requires that we take immediate action at home and promote> effective action worldwide. We must have population control at home, hopefully> through a system of incentives and penalties, but by compulsion if voluntary> methods fail…We can no longer afford merely to treat the symptoms of the> cancer of population growth; the cancer itself must be cut out.” 66Ehrlich was a biologist at the Elite-controlled Stanford University and hiswife, Anne, was a member of the Club of Rome.67 He said that compulsory birthcontrol could be imposed by governments via the addition of “temporarysterilants to water supplies or staple food”.68 Shortly, when we come to the“Report from Iron Mountain,” you will see the even greater relevance of thisstatement. The ‘brutal and tough-minded’ decisions which Ehrlich said would berequired are evident in Henry Kissinger’s much-loved abode, China. It was herethat the one-child-per-family policy was implemented and paid for directly, orindirectly, by the United Nations. Western and Chinese observers have spoken ofseeing thousands of women “rounded up and forced to have abortions”; of women“locked in detention centres or hauled before mass rallies and harangued intoconsenting to abortions”; of “vigilantes abducting pregnant women on thestreets, hauling them off, sometimes handcuffed and trussed, to abortionclinics”. There are much worse stories even than those.The United Nations network of organisations is awash with interlinked populationcontrol policies and eugenics. Behind them all is the Elite’s secret government.When the UN secretary general, U Thant, started the UN Fund for PopulationActivities, it was administered by one Paul Hoffman (CFR, Bil), a US chief offoreign aid, trustee of the Institute of Pacific Relations and administrator ofthe Ford Foundation funds. He was also a member of the London-Wall Streetfinancial clique. Professor Jacqueline Kasun, an outspoken opponent of UNpopulation policies in her book, The War Against Population, revealed thenetwork of agencies linked to the UN Fund for Population:> “Deriving its income from the United States and other governments, it provides> support to numerous ‘non-governmental organisations’, including the> [Rockefellers’] Population Council, the Population Action Council, Worldwatch,> the Population Crisis Committee and Draper Fund, and the Centre for Population> Activities. These organisations in turn make grants to each other and still> other organisations.” 69The Elite’s World Bank, which is supposed to make grants to help the developmentof the poorer countries, also has population control at the top of its agenda.In 1992, the World Bank President, Lewis Preston (CFR) said at the Rio EarthSummit that he would increase substantially the bank’s support for populationcontrol – later pledging to double the money made available. The bank’sInternational Safe Motherhood Initiative is a joint project with theInternational Planned Parenthood Federation, Family Care International, thePopulation Council (funded by US government aid programmes), and other agencies.These include several from the UN such as the Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and theWorld Health Organisation (WHO). This ‘initiative’ involves forced birth controlon pain of economic reprisals. As President Preston said, the Safe Motherhoodagenda would be “integrated into the bank’s policy dialogue with developingcountries”. Cut your population or you get no cash. There, Mr Preston, that’s asimpler way to put it. Robert McNamara (TC, CFR, Bil), the head of the WorldBank in the 1970s, is a vehement campaigner for population control. “The threatof unmanageable population pressures is very much like the threat of nuclearwar” he said in the Boston Globe in 1982. This is the mindset of theorganisation which controls ‘development’ funding in the Third World.So the Club of Rome and its associated connections within the United Nations,the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and nation governments has therole in the network to promote the use of the environment to demand centralisedcontrol and eugenics. The Club of Rome was launched publicly in 1968, just a fewyears after a group of invited ‘experts’ met in the United States to prepare areport which, it is plain to see, was to inspire the sort of policies I’ve justdescribed.The Report from Iron Mountain70This was the secret report of the Special Study Group of fifteen people broughttogether during the Kennedy years. The proposal for the study group came around1961 and it was established in August 1963. Among those assembled is claimed bysome researchers to have been John Kenneth Galbraith (CFR), the Keynesianeconomist. The first and last meetings were at Iron Mountain, an undergroundfacility near the town of Hudson, New York. It is a place where importantdocuments are stored and the base for the emergency corporate headquarters forcorporations like Standard Oil of New Jersey (the Rockefellers, Exxon),Manufacturers Hanover Trust (Rothschilds), and Shell. The content of the reportwas revealed by one of the group who believed the public should know what itcontained. This group member had the code name ‘John Doe’ and his friend,Leonard C. Lewin, produced a document summarising the Iron Mountain report. Ihave a copy of this.71 It says that the idea for the study came from members ofthe Kennedy Administration like Robert McNamara (TC, CFR, Bil), McGeorge Bundy(TC, CFR, Bil), and Dean Rusk (TC, CFR, Bil). The brief was to study theimplications of a world without war while still maintaining the control of thepopulation wielded by war and the fear of war. Part of the report said:> “There is no question [that] a universal requirement that procreation be> limited to the products of artificial insemination would provide a fully> adequate substitute control for population levels. Such a reproductive system> would, of course, have the added advantage of being susceptible to direct> eugenic management. Its predictable further development – conception and> embryonic growth taking place wholly under laboratory conditions – would> extend these controls to their logical conclusion. The ecological function of> war under these circumstances would not only be superseded, but surpassed in> effectiveness.> “The indicated immediate step – total control of conception with a variant of> the ubiquitous ‘pill’, via water supplies or certain essential foodstuffs,> offset by a controlled ‘antidote’ – is already under development.”Remember this was the 1960s. More than thirty years have passed since then andsuch an ‘indicated immediate step’ was ‘already under development’. So what thehell is going on today in our water supplies and essential foodstuffs, both ofwhich are largely controlled by Elite companies? Also, just look again at whatProfessor Paul Ehrlich said in his book, The Population Bomb, published twoyears after this secret report was completed in 1966. He said that governmentscould enforce birth control by the addition of “temporary sterilants to watersupplies or staple food…”. Yet another amazing coincidence. The Report From IronMountain laid out the functions of war which new policies would have to replace:> 1 Economic. War has provided both ancient and modern societies with a> dependable system for stabilising and controlling national economies. No> alternate method of control has yet been tested in a complex modern economy> that has shown itself remotely comparable in scope or effectiveness.> 2 Political. The permanent possibility of war is the foundation for stable> government; it supplies the basis for general acceptance of political> authority. It has enabled societies to maintain necessary class distinctions,> and it has ensured the subordination of the citizen to the state, by virtue of> the residue war powers inherent in the concept of nationhood. No modern> political ruling group has successfully controlled its constituency after> failing to sustain the continuing credibility of an external threat of war.> 3 Sociological. War, through the medium of military institutions, has> uniquely served societies, throughout the course of known history, as an> indispensable controller of dangerous [free-thinking] social dissidence and> destructive antisocial tendencies.> 4 Ecological. War has been the principle evolutionary device for maintaining> a satisfactory ecological balance between gross human population and supplies> available for survival. It is unique to the human species.Very nice, I’m sure. So what did these ‘experts’ suggest as alternatives tofurther world wars? Unite the people behind the controllers under the threat ofwar or some other form of destruction and keep them in a permanent state offear, therefore dependent on their perceived ‘saviours’. In the light of thisneed to control without world war, the Report From Iron Mountain proposed thefollowing for consideration:> “An omnipresent, virtually omnipotent international police force [a world army> now called the United Nations Peace Keeping Force and NATO]; an established> and recognised extraterrestrial menace [now being engineered with the themes> of horrible aliens and a possible invasion of Earth?]; massive global> environmental pollution; fictitious alternate enemies; a modern, sophisticated> form of slavery; new religions or other mythologies; a comprehensive programme> of applied eugenics.”All of these things have emerged since the report was completed. There you seethe proposal for the environmental threat/eugenics scenario which was to followvery soon afterwards. The report called for the establishment of a secretWar/Peace Research Agency using “unaccountable funds” which would study both thepeace and war options. Among the research required, said the report, was the“…determination of minimum and optimum levels of destruction of life, property,and natural resources prerequisite to the credibility of external threatessential to the political and motivational functions” and “[the] frequency ofoccurrence, length of phase, intensity of physical destruction, extensiveness ofgeographical involvement, and optimum mean loss of life”. This is the deeplyimbalanced state of mind behind those who promote and manipulate into being theNew World Order, and conflicts are created to fit in with this plan – the war inthe former Yugoslavia being another example.In this chapter, I have described the network of Round Table-Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs-Council on Foreign Relations-Bilderberg Group-TrilateralCommission-United Nations-European Union-Club of Rome, which together constitutea secret government of the world acting outside and above what laughably passesas the ‘democratic process’. I have further shown that the members of thesegroups follow a long tradition of manipulators working from the same agenda ofworld government, central bank, currency, and army, and a geneticallyengineered, microchipped population. But the organisation behind the New WorldOrder coup d’état is far wider and more complex than this network of frontorganisations. They are a vital part, but only a part, of the Pyramid of Deceit.It is on that pyramid the spotlight will now be turned.> SOURCES> > > 1 Noam Chomsky, What Uncle Sam Really Wants (Odonian Press, fifth> > > printing, Berkeley, California, 1993) p12> > > 2 Ibid> > > 3 Ibid p24> > > 4 Hans Heymann, Plan For Permanent Peace (Harper & Brothers, New York,> > > 1941) p78> > > 5 “Time for all Good Europeans to Come to the Aid of Our Venture.” The> > > European (July 7th–13th 1995) p6> > > 6 RIIA Annual Report 1992–93> > > 7 Ibid> > > 8/9 Barings and S.G.

There are many connections between the Elite-Brotherhood andblack magic, and once you get involved in that, it is easy for yourconsciousness to be taken over by an extreme negative force. Such ceremonies andritual can conjure up very dark and malevolent energies, which can possess thepeople involved. Most Freemasons learn the lines of their ceremonies and gothrough the ritual without any idea of what they are playing around with andattracting to them. Most think it is just a gentlemen’s club, but the ceremonialhas been designed to attract extreme negative energies which allow a“possession” by the negative elements of the Fourth Dimension.When I spoke at a spiritual-healing exhibition in Birmingham, I was surprised tofind it was being held in the main Freemasons’ centre in what is Britain’ssecond city. The Freemasons rent part of the complex to outside organisations toearn money. I was delighted because it allowed me to study the subject in theheart of what must be among the largest centres of Freemasonry in the UnitedKingdom. By ‘coincidence’ while I was there, I managed to see the inside of someof the temples where the public are not allowed to go. The complex, called theClarendon Suites, is built virtually without windows once you get through themain entrance. This is appropriately symbolic, I feel, of keeping out the Light.I walked into a temple of the Royal Arch branch of Freemasonry where the publicare not allowed to go, and I will never forget the feeling of extreme negativeenergy hitting me the moment I stepped through the door. Goodness knows whatthey must do to attract that scale of malevolence! It took the breath away. Andmost of the members will not understand what they are doing. Once yousynchronise vibrationally with that sort of energy, it can take you over andcontrol you – especially if you have no understanding of what you are messingwith. You can become a mental robot of the Prison Warders, without knowing it.This is how people are snared and pulled into the net. It won’t happen to everyFreemason because it depends on their intent and their own vibrational rate atthe time, but it happens to those who are of a state of mind that is open tosuch possession.Freemasonry, like the Elite network in general, can manipulate and deceive mostof its own membership because it is structured like a pyramid. If you look atany organisation, from a small business to a multinational corporation, you willsee the same pyramid structure. At the top will be a very few people who knoweverything there is to know about the organisation, its motivation, agenda, andthe direction it wishes to go. The further you descend from the peak, you meetmore and more people who know less and less about that overall picture. They areonly aware of their part in the organisation and not everyone else’s. This is amanipulator’s dream and it is the means through which the Elite can control somany people and organisations across the world.[../Images/00023.jpg]Figure 8Most of those working for the New World Order agenda don’t know they are doingso. The conspiracy couldn’t exist if everyone involved was in on the plot.Manipulating the manipulators and controlling the controllers is essential toits success. Take the CIA. It has a policy of ‘compartmentalisation’. Put moresimply, the ‘need to know’ approach. At the top of the CIA are those who knowthe true nature of its agenda. The further down you go, the less the CIAemployees are aware of this wider perspective. There can be many people withinthe CIA who do their daily tasks quite innocently. They might think that whatthey are doing is serving the United States and is not at all sinister. But theydon’t know how what they are doing connects with the work of others like themthroughout the pyramid to produce a very unpleasant picture. Only those few atthe top know that. It is in this way that the Elite control and manipulate. Eachof the various elements, the Council on Foreign Relations, Freemasonry, etc arealso structured as pyramids, and they are themselves all a part of a vast globalpyramid with the Elite at the top. It may appear to be a mass of unconnectedorganisations and people, but there is a central controlling force that holdsthe structure together and unites it into a common cause and policy (Figure 8).The Global EliteAt the apex of this global empire are the Elite who are, I believe, solidlylocked into the Fourth Dimensional Prison Warder consciousness which decides thepolicy and oversees its implementation. I don’t know exactly the pecking orderof power here, but I am confident about the various elements involved, at least.I believe that at the highest levels of the Global Elite are shadowy people whoare not known to the public. I would say that the force behind the House ofRothschild is right up there, but I do not believe they are at the top. They toowill be taking orders and maybe the Habsburg dynasty is above them in thehierarchy. The Elite’s power stems from their misuse of the esoteric knowledgeand their conscious connection to their ‘gods’, the Prison Warders. Perhapsno-one I name in this book will be at that level. People such as HenryKissinger, are yes-men, and super-gofers, albeit high-powered ones. Many of theothers will be used without their knowledge, or full knowledge, of what they arepart of. I am naming the pawns, the gofers and super-gofers, of this small groupof people I call the Super Elite, the Black Magicians. These are the controllersof the All-Seeing Eye cult, which is the force behind the Global Elite and thosewho are manipulating the New World Order into being. Some researchers believethat the Rothschilds are at the peak of the Pyramid (I don’t) and under them isa Council of Thirteen, a Council of Thirty Three, and then the Committee of 300,also known as the Olympians.1The Global Elite as a whole is the group of people who are selected andinitiated into the higher, sometimes highest, levels of knowledge in the wholehuman structure. While they will be working today to speed the emergence of theNew World Order, they will also be looking for others who are deemed to be ofthe right calibre. Then, as the present personnel ‘retire’ or die, the reins ofthe conspiracy are handed to the next generation of the Elite, just as AverellHarriman was replaced in his role by Henry Kissinger. In the same way UmbertoAgnelli (Bil) is being prepared to replace his ageing father Giovanni Agnelli inthe Elite hierarchy. So while the ‘they’ – the actual personnel – change withthe generations, the agenda they are working from remains basically the same. Itis like passing on a baton in a relay race and, because of the nature of thefamily structure of much of the Elite, the baton is often handed on across thegenerations of certain families. This becomes even more understandable becausethe parents indoctrinate the children from the earliest possible age and laterintroduce them to the same secret societies and ceremonial which synchronisesthem into the Prison Warders’ vibration.The IlluminatiNot every member of a secret society or the other organisations I name is partof the Elite. There is a difference between Freemasonry and what I will term‘Illuminised’ Freemasonry, those parts of the order which have been infiltratedby Illuminati agents. The word Illuminati – ‘the Illuminated Ones’ – goes backinto the ancient world. It is a covert force which has created or taken overgroups and organisations to manipulate the world in the desired direction. TheIlluminati’s greatest weapon is the advanced esoteric knowledge it has passed onthrough its initiation ceremonies and the misuse and abuse of that knowledge.The most obvious expression of Illuminism was the Bavarian Illuminati officiallycreated by the German professor, Adam Weishaupt, in May 1776, and controlled bythe House of Rothschild, the bankers to endless revolutions and wars. It wasWeishaupt who used his wing of the Illuminati to infiltrate and take overFreemasonry.Weishaupt was trained as a Jesuit, which is short for the Society of Jesus. Thefounder of the Jesuits, the Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, formed a secret societywithin this apparently Catholic order and the initiates were called the‘Alumbrados’ which means the ‘enlightened’, the ‘illuminated’. Conflict followedbetween the Jesuit ‘illuminism’ and Weishaupt’s German version, battles whichthe traditions of Weishaupt mostly won although the Jesuit network is still verymuch a part of the Elite. Weishaupt created 13 degrees of initiation in hisIlluminati and the key personnel were to be found in the top nine degrees. TheIlluminati is a pyramid, too. The members were given special Illuminati names,inspired by ancient Rome and Greece. Weishaupt was called Spartacus. Thesepeople became members of other secret societies like the Freemasons and‘illuminised’ them – took them over and used them to destabilise nations andhasten the New World Order. They did the same within governments, banking,commerce, the military, and the media, on behalf of the Elite.So there is Freemasonry and Illuminised Freemasonry. The former manipulates atone level, but it too is being manipulated by another covert force, theIlluminati, which in turn answers to its Global Elite. There are organisationswithin organisations (say, the Freemasonry network within a government) andanother organisation within those organisations (the Illuminati membershipwithin the Freemasons). This Illuminised form of Freemasonry became known as TheGrand Orient Lodges. It followed the modified Hegelian tradition of infiltratingtwo extremes and playing one off against the other to create the desired change.Using these methods, it was pledged to overthrow the rule of the monarchies,destroy faith in God, put an end to patriotism and nation states, abolish theownership of property and dismantle traditional social order.The Black NobilityThe Illuminati interconnects within the Global Elite with what is known as theBlack Nobility, an ancient grouping of ‘blue bloods’. It has its base in Italy,particularly in Venice and Genoa. Both John Cabot (real name Giovanni Cabotto)and Christopher Columbus lived in Genoa before ‘discovering’ different parts ofthe Americas within four years of each other. Today another Giovanni is claimedby scores of researchers to be a member of one of the Black Nobility families.This is Giovanni Agnelli, longtime head of the Fiat Motor Company until 1996 anda leading Bilderberger. The Agnelli family dominates Italy and it is said, onlyhalf jokingly, that the main responsibility of an Italian prime minister is to“polish Agnelli’s doorknobs”.2 Agnelli had a much publicised relationship withPamela Churchill, Winston’s daughter-in-law, before she married…AverellHarriman. She was a leading fundraiser for Bill Clinton and became US Ambassadorto Paris. The Agnelli family were closely connected with Mussolini, andGiovanni’s grandfather was made a senator for life by the fascist leader. Somefamilies of the Black Nobility in Venice and Rome claim an ancestry back to theRoman Emperor Justinian, a man reputed to have taken references to reincarnationout of the biblical texts in the year 553. They have a desire to return to asystem symbolised by the Roman Empire and they are a major force within theGlobal Elite. This ‘noble’ line would appear to go back at least a thousandyears, probably far longer, and emerged in part through the Guelf and Ghibellineconflicts in Italy in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.Guelf came from Welf, a German prince competing for control of the Holy RomanEmpire, and Ghibelline came from the name of the castle owned by his opponents,the Hohenstaufen family. The Guelfs supported the Pope and the Ghibellinessupported the rule of the Hohenstaufen family. Great conflict followed, with theGuelfs triumphant in the end. The Guelfs (Black Nobility) became immenselypowerful through their later control of banking and international trade. Theyset up great financial centres in Lombardy and they dominated the scene so muchthat Lombard became the name given to all Italian bankers in Florence, Genoa,Venice, and Milan. Eventually they expanded their influence northwards toHamburg, Amsterdam and London. Today the Black Nobility also control thefinancial centres of Switzerland where the spoils of the drug trade and otherillegal activities are laundered behind the façade of Swiss respectability. TheBlack Nobility were at the heart of the slave trade from where the fortunes ofmany leading American and British families originated and they were behind theOrange Order which put William of Orange on the British throne, and led to theBank of England and the National Debt. In more recent times, the Orange Orderhas been behind the Protestant wing of the conflict in Northern Ireland.The Black Nobility includes, or is at least connected to, the Dutch Royal Familyof Prince Bernhard, one of the founders of the Bilderberg Group. Its connectionsextend to London and the British ‘establishment’ families of the old aristocracyand the new ‘money’ aristocracies. Members of the European bluebloods which areclosely linked with the British Royal Family are involved. The Swedish, Dutchand Spanish royal families are often represented at Bilderberg meetings. In theUK, Prince Philip and Prince Charles have attended Bilderberg meetings and QueenElizabeth II is named as a member of the Committee of 300.3 It is believed byresearchers who have investigated the Black Nobility, that at this level theBritish Royal Family is subordinate to the Italian members who trace theirancestry back to the original Guelfs and beyond. I feel that the viciouspersonal attacks on Prince Charles and the taped telephone conversationsreleased to the media, which have done so much to damage him, are no accident.Is it part of a coordinated campaign to undermine him? Is he a rebel they wishto destroy? It is possible. Charles and his brother Andrew, turned down theoffer to become Freemasons, an organisation with close connections to theBritish monarchy over the years. The Illuminati/Black Nobility/Global Elite usemany secret and less secret organisations in pursuit of their global tyranny andthe most all-pervading of them is Freemasonry. Illuminised Freemasonry is thefirst level down from the Illuminati/Black Nobility, and you will find itsmembership involved in all the organisations in the network I described in thelast chapter: the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Council onForeign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, and their like-minded brethren.[../Images/00001.jpg]Figure 9FreemasonryThe vast majority of Freemasons in the world never progress beyond the bottomthree levels of degree (Figure 9). But above them are another thirty higherlevels in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which owes its inspiration to theancient Knights Templar. Even the 33rd degree is not the top because there arethe Illuminati levels above that, and the 33rd degree itself is unofficiallydivided into two streams, one knowing far more than the other. At each stage,the initiate is told a little more about the true nature of Freemasonry and thereal game plan. Those who have reached the 33rd degree are on a different planetin terms of what they know, compared with the Masons on the bottom three levels.Joseph Smith, the ‘prophet’ who founded the appalling Mormon ‘church’, was a33rd degree Freemason. The men who go down to the local Freemasons’ lodge inyour town or city will not have a clue what their organisation is being usedfor. They have to be kept in the dark if the plan is to work and what better wayof doing this than to use these distinct levels of initiation. Only thoseconsidered to be ‘acceptable’ progress to the higher levels and find out what isreally going on. The vast majority of Freemasons are on the bottom three levels.They are the fodder and the front. Between the 4th and 33rd degrees, you findthose of the ‘right mind’ who have influence in society, right up to presidentsof the United States. Then you have the Illuminati levels, which you will notsee mentioned in any Freemasons guidebook. Those are the people who actually runthe show and they are the agents of the All-Seeing Eye cult. World Freemasonryis a massive pyramid of manipulation.It was not always like this. It is said that Freemasonry was once a society thatwas exclusive to those who worked as stonemasons and builders on the churchesand cathedrals. It was then called Masonry. Their lodges were like tradeorganisations some historians claim, and their secrecy and rituals were designedto protect their profession from unskilled outsiders. Most of the Masons’ workcame from the Catholic Church, ruled from Rome. The immense wealth of theChurch, most of it stolen directly or indirectly, paid for the construction ofthe great cathedrals on which the masons’ income largely depended. But disastercame when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and formed his own Church ofEngland after the Pope refused him a divorce. This event had many implicationsfor the future (see The Robots’ Rebellion) and it ensured that many masons weremade unemployed. Far from continuing the building programmes of Rome, Henrylooted the monasteries and everything else he could get away with. He was broke,basically, and there were always wars to fight. One of his targets was theassets of the ‘fraternities, brotherhoods and guilds’. The masonry societiescollapsed in the wake of this royal mugging and the desperate lack of work fortheir members. Many of the lodges disappeared, along with their ancient records,and little is known about their true history.The lodges (branches) which survived did so by opening their memberships topeople who were not stonemasons, or so the story goes. These newcomers – thebusinessmen, merchants, landowners, and aristocracy – were called ‘speculative’masons and soon they far outnumbered the original members. This was the KnightsTemplar/Illuminati manifesting on the public stage in the guise of Freemasonry.The first recorded initiation of a speculative mason in England was in 1646 whenElias Ashmole (don’t say it too quickly) joined a lodge in Warrington. He was anastrologer and indeed esoteric knowledge was to be an important part of the newMasonry at the higher levels of initiation. Masonry had become Freemasonry andas the years passed, the only remaining connection with the stonemasons were thesymbolic paraphernalia and names for the levels of initiation like apprentice,fellow craft, and master mason. The working tools of the stonemasons – thesquare, compasses, level, plumbline, gauge, gavel, and chisel – were still usedin the bizarre ceremonies and rituals and the Freemason’s apron was anotherthrowback to the stone masons. But Freemasonry now had a very different agenda.During the rituals which the founders of the new Freemasonry introduced,bare-chested initiates were blindfolded with a noose around their neck and adagger held to their heart. They had to swear to serve the order and keep itssecrets, on pain of a grotesque ritual death. The penalty for divulging thesecrets of the Second Degree (the Fellow Craft Mason) is “having my left breastlaid open, my heart torn therefrom, and given to the ravenous birds of the air,or devouring beasts of the field as a prey”. In the Third Degree (Master Mason)it is “being severed in two, my bowels burnt to ashes, and those ashes scatteredover the face of the Earth and wafted by the four winds of heaven, that no traceof remembrance of so vile a wretch may longer be found among men, particularlyMaster Masons”.4 Charming.These are the sorts of ceremonies that conjure up the malevolent energies. Atthe same time, in public, Freemasonry is claiming to be a school of morality andit talks of fraternity and ‘brotherly love’! The public apologists forFreemasonry will tell you that these rituals are only symbolic, but there ismuch evidence that not everyone thinks so, including the Freemason known as Jackthe Ripper. The powerful ties of loyalty (and fear, too, when necessary)engendered in the membership makes sure that very few have dared to disclose thesecrets, even after leaving the craft. In fact, while people may cease to paytheir fees or turn up at the lodge, the oaths still apply. There is no mechanismby which a Mason, once initiated, can unswear his oath.Such oaths were invented to create fear and control. They were not part of therituals of stonemasons, as some of their few surviving rule books, the ‘GothicConstitutions’ as they are called, have proved. The penalty for revealing thesecrets in those days was to be thrown out of the lodge. It beats having yourbowels burnt to ashes, for sure. The Freemasonry rituals and oaths are based ona piece of invention in the eighteenth century – the Freemason story of HiramAbif. According to the Freemasonry invention, Hiram Abif was the architect ofSolomon’s biblical Temple. The Gothic Constitutions of the stonemasons make noreference to such a man, but he became the Freemasons’ martyr figure. Inventionhas it that Hiram refused to betray the secrets to three fellow craft masonsarmed with masonic tools. They murdered him when he would not reveal hissecrets, so the myth goes, and King Solomon ordered a search when Hiram appearedto be missing. Hiram’s body was discovered ‘indecently interred’ and wasreburied with ‘all respect and reverence’. Solomon ordered those responsible forthe murder to be executed and in some versions of the story, the killers,Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum, were so full of remorse that they asked to be putto death. Jubela asked for his throat to be cut and his tongue torn out; Jubelochose to have his left breast torn open and his heart fed to the vultures; andJubelum was the one who asked for his bowels to be burned to ashes and scatteredbefore the four winds of heaven. You can see where the Freemasons’ rituals andoaths come from. Their rituals play out the story and death of Hiram Abif,baring their breast with their trouser legs rolled up to bare their knees.5The story of Hiram Abif is a fantasy. The Freemasonic thought police have madegreat play of the ancient links with the building of King Solomon’s Temple inJerusalem. They have turned it into something akin to the Vatican – and thensome. But the Bible from which the figure of Hiram was taken, describes a verydifferent man. First of all his name was simply Hiram. The addition of Abif camefrom the founders of masonic myth. Abif’s a miff, you might say. And what doesthe Bible say about this man? Does it say that he was “the most accomplishedmason on Earth”, as the Freemasons claim? Not quite. It says that he was neithera mason nor an architect, but a worker in brass. According to the Book of Kings,he arrived from Tyre after the temple was finished. The Book of Chronicles sayshe came before the Temple was built and was an ornamental metal worker. Anystone skills he had were in decoration, not construction. There is another Hiramin the Bible, the King of Tyre, who is not the same man. But he is also held ingreat esteem by Freemasonry because he is supposed to have supplied Solomon withLebanese cedarwood for the Temple. And that’s another thing. The Bible says theTemple was built mostly of wood and was no bigger than a church hall of today(30 by 90 feet). The last thing they needed was a stonemason architect. Butwhile the story of Hiram Abif is a nonsense, it is possible that its themesoriginate in ancient Egypt when King Seqenenre was murdered for refusing toreveal the most secret esoteric knowledge to a rival. If so, this is yet furtherconfirmation that the same stream of knowledge and manipulation stretches fromantiquity into modern Freemasonry and the world today. My feeling is that theforce that emerged as Freemasonry was, and is, the Knights Templar, which untilthen had been operating underground, following the papal purge. The pyramidstructure allows the Elite, the few at the top of Freemasonry, to control themajority by misleading them and keeping them in the dark. The IlluminatiProtocols, found in the last century, did – whatever people may say about theirorigin – describe brilliantly how Freemasons are used:> “We shall create and multiply Freemasonic lodges in all countries of the> world, absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in public> activity, for in these lodges we shall find our principal intelligence office> and means of influence. All these lodges we shall bring under one central> administration [The Illuminati], known to us alone and to all others> absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders… In these> lodges we shall tie together all revolutionary and liberal elements. Their> composition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret> political plots will be known to us and will fall under our guiding hands on> the very day of their conception. Among the members of the lodges will be> almost all the agents of international and national police since their service> is for us irreplaceable in the respect that the police is in a position not> only to use its own particular measures with the insubordinate, but also to> screen our activities and to provide pretexts for discontents…”> Protocol 15The protocols describe the Masons on the lower levels of degree – the greatmajority – as a part of a ‘show army’ who are there only “to kick dust in theeyes of their fellows”. Everyone is manipulating everyone else. Unless we knowthe secret society background of people employed by the controllinginstitutions, be it the police, politicians, doctors, military officers, editorsand journalists, or government officials, and unless we know what that secretsociety truly stands for, how can we possibly know what agenda those who run acountry or community are working from? These people pledge their totalallegiance to their secret society in these ritual ceremonies, so what happensto their allegiance to the public they have been elected or appointed to serve?While people in the secret societies are allowed into such positions of controland influence without even having to acknowledge their membership, the wholesystem is open to the most outrageous corruption. And that is what happens. Thesystem is outrageously corrupt. Not every member is corrupt; most are not. Butit doesn’t take many to have a terrific impact on society.Once you have Freemasons in the top positions, who decide which people arerecruited or promoted within an organisation, you can make sure that fellowFreemasons get into the key positions of power. One generation of Freemasonsfollows another as the baton is handed over. When you have achieved this you canrun an organisation or a country almost as you like. Or a world. Freemasons alsocommit themselves to helping each other in distress. That sounds very nice, butwhat about those who are not part of the club, the ‘Profane’, as we are called?Does that mean we are subject to lesser consideration when faced with aFreemason in authority? In at least a number of cases, the answer is mostcertainly “yes”. The Freemasons have a series of signs and words which allowthem to recognise each other, including the funny handshake. These also includethe Freemasons’ sign for “grief and distress” (i.e. Get me out of trouble), theverbal version of which is: “Will no-one help the widow’s son?” The widow’s sonis Hiram Abif.These signs and signals come in very handy when you are arrested by Freemasonpolice officers or appear in court before a Freemason judge. It doesn’t alwayswork, of course, but we are kidding ourselves if we think it doesn’t happen. Thepolitical determination to tackle this dangerous injustice is simply not there,because either the politicians involved – of all parties – are Freemasonsthemselves or connected with the wider network, or they are frightened to actbecause their position depends on them not upsetting the secret society elite.Some leading politicians are high ranking Freemasons. Lord Palmerston, theBritish Prime Minister at the time of the opium wars against China, was theGrand Patriarch of the Grand Orient [Illuminati] version of the order. Theformer French president, François Mitterand (Comm 300), was also a Grand Masterof the Grand Orient.6Most of the names I have mentioned in the book, those involved with theTrilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group,and all the rest will also be Freemasons or members of some connected secretsociety. But they are all answerable to the same master – the Global Elite. Inmost countries there is an elite Freemasonry ‘cell’ which is particularlypowerful and which may be unknown even to some high ranking Freemasons. Thereare many cells linked to the Illuminati-controlled forms of Freemasonry, theGrand Orient Lodges. The French Revolution was partly hatched and coordinated bythe Grand Orient Lodge in Paris. In Britain there are, according to some, anelite cell called the Parlour Club and a European elite group called the Club ofthe Isles.7 In the US they have the the Skull and Bones Society, which isclosely related to Freemasonry, and so is the Orange Order which is at the heartof the Northern Ireland conflict. The Round Table is designed on Freemasoniclines and links in with that network. The infamous Knights of Malta are anotherelite organisation which coordinates its covert activities with IlluminisedFreemasonry and has enormous influence within the system. Its official head isthe Pope! The best known of the Elite Freemasonry cells is the PropagandaMasonica Due Lodge (P2) based in Italy, but operating in other countries also.When this was discovered, it produced one of the greatest political scandals inhistory. If we look at the background of the P2, you will appreciate how theseElite Freemasonry cells operate in countries around the world and the methodsthey use.Propaganda Masonica Due (P2)The P2 Lodge in Rome was founded in 1877 for those Freemasons who were visitingthe capital from other parts of Italy. It had only fourteen members by themid-1960s, but it was about to be launched into world prominence when it was‘restructured’ by Licio Gelli at the request of the Grand Master of Italy, LinoSalvini. Once Gelli took over, the membership of the P2 Lodge soared within afew years to almost a thousand, although he was almost certainly the vehicle forother powers behind P2 who kept their control secret. Some researchers believethis hidden control to be the Alpine Freemasons’ Lodge in Switzerland, which hashad among its membership, Henry Kissinger and the founder of the Club of Rome,Aurelio Peccei (Bil). Others say this was only the ‘middle man’ between P2 andits real controllers, the banking interests centred on the House of Rothschild.P2 initiation ceremonies took place at its headquarters in the Excelsior Hotelunder the supervision of a former Grand Master of Italy, Giordano Gamberini, butthe name most associated with P2 is Gelli.Gelli was a fascist supporter of Mussolini during the war and helped to organisethe “rat line” which smuggled Nazis out of Germany when the Allies invaded. Hefled to Argentina some years later when his background came to light and he mademany political friends there, including the dictator, Juan Peron (for whom hebecame an economic advisor), and Jose Lopez Rega, the man behind the Triple Adeath squads responsible for thousands of murders. Rega raised vast sums bysmuggling cocaine into the United States. When Peron came out of exile to takepower for the second time, he fell on his knees in public to thank Gelli. ManyNazis fled to South America after the war and P2 is closely connected with NaziInternational. Gelli, as a committed fascist, would have been very much at homein such company. Indeed it was he who helped many Nazis, like Claus Barbie,escape to South America (which became a bigger version of Germany as it wasunder Hitler). Gelli was close to the Nazi dictator of Nicaragua, Somoza, and hewas also connected with the Nazi paramilitary organisation operating in Italycalled U Gladio (a CIA front).Gelli returned to Italy in the mid-1960s as Argentina’s honourary consul. Hebuilt a network of contacts in high places around him after he became a GrandOrient Freemason in 1965. This was helped by his membership in the Knights ofMalta, which gave him an ‘in’ to the highest levels of the Vatican, a link heand P2 were to exploit so effectively. Gelli’s friends in the United StatesRepublican Party invited him to the inauguration of President Reagan in 1981.(Reagan would later lay a wreath on the graves of SS storm troopers during the40th anniversary ceremonies of the Second World War, the symbolism of whichwould have been very powerful for the Nazi mentalities in the CIA and the GlobalElite, the real controllers of the P2.) Gelli also attended the inaugurations ofPresidents Carter and Ford, and he called himself a friend of George Bush.In July 1981, Gelli’s daughter was stopped at Rome Airport and documents wereconfiscated from the false bottom of her suitcase. They were copies of theUnited States document known as Supplement B. This was a supplement to the USField Army Manual FM 30-31. It was dated March 18th 1970 and signed by GeneralWestmoreland. It describes how to destabilise a country through infiltration ofthe controlling organisations and the use of agents provocateur.8 This isprecisely what Gelli and his controllers did.Gelli worked successfully to win official recognition for Italian Freemasonryfrom the centre of world Freemasonry, the United Grand Lodge in London. ItalianFreemasonry has a long history of controversy and involvement in politics. Itwas banned by Mussollini, as was German Freemasonry by Hitler, not the leastbecause they were both helped to power by secret societies and realised theirinfluence. After the war, the American OSS, the forerunner to the CIA, putpressure on the desperate Italian government to allow Freemasonry to return andthe Mother Lodge in London conferred official recognition. In doing so, they hadofficially recognised an organisation that has the closest of connections withthe Mafia. These ties go back to the ‘Carbonari’, an amalgamation of Freemasons,the Mafia, and the military, which was formed in the nineteenth century tooppose Napoleon. The Carbonari were also closely linked with the GuelphicKnights – the Black Nobility.Through the 1970s, Gelli was recruiting some of the most powerful people inItalian society into P2 until he had created a state within a state, workingfrom a common agenda. The names of the membership were known to him and maybeone or two others. Not even the other members knew all the names on the P2membership list. Using the well-tested Elite structure, he divided themembership into two divisions and then subdivided them into a series of othergroups. Only the leaders of these groups knew who their members were – and thenonly those in their particular group. P2 members were controlled by the terrorof knowing the horrific penalties for not doing as they were told. When, inMarch 1981, Gelli’s premises were raided by police they discovered 962 names onthe P2 membership lists in his office safe and suitcase. There were threecabinet ministers, forty other MPs, forty-three generals, eight admirals andhundreds of civil servants and diplomats, heads of the security services, thechiefs of police in the country’s four biggest cities, industrialists,financiers, TV stars, and twenty-four journalists. I believe strongly thatsomething similar is happening in the United Kingdom and many other countries,which mirrors the methods and aims of P2. Henry Kissinger was believed by someto be a member of P2 or at least a major force in its policy and methods. P2certainly has a powerful foreign membership, which gives it tremendous influencewithin European and US intelligence and banking. The Italian Prime Minister,Giulio Andreotti was close to Gelli. When Andreotti stood trial for involvementwith the Mafia he named his character witnesses as the former United NationsSecretary General, Perez de Cuellar (a reputed P2 member), and…Henry Kissinger.9The journalist, Mino Peccorelli, a member of P2, said it was actually run by theCIA. He wasn’t allowed to say it for very long, though. Peccorelli was murderedby a means acknowledged as a Mafia death-ritual for those who say too much. Moreevidence for the CIA connection came from former CIA contract agent, RichardBrenneke, in an interview on Italian Television on July 2nd 1990. He said:> “We [the CIA] have used the assistance of these people [P2] to get in and out> of the United States drugs and money, and to get in and out of Italy drugs and> money. We used these people to create situations that would favour the> explosion of terrorism in Italy and other European countries at the beginning> of the 70s. The P2 is still alive and it is still used for the same purposes> as at the beginning of the 70s. The CIA has financed the P2 to the tune of $1> million to $10 million per month…That CIA money was used for several purposes,> one of them terrorism. Another purpose was to obtain support in smuggling> drugs coming from other countries into the US. There also has always been a> connection between P2 and the CIA.”Brenneke was another who said that Licio Gelli was only the nominal head of P2and the real control came via Switzerland and the United States. The 1970s andearly 1980s were terrible years for Italy. Terrorism sponsored by P2 includedthe bombing at Bologna Railway Station, in which eighty-five people died in1980. A terrorist group called The Red Brigade was blamed for many atrocities,including the kidnap and murder in 1978 of the Christian Democrat leader andformer Prime Minister of Italy, Aldo Moro, in which five of his bodyguards alsodied. Terrorist groups like the Red Brigade and the Baader-Meinhoff Gang inGermany are not all that they seem. As with these two groups, their members areoften trained by the CIA or other Elite organisations. They are part of theproblem-reaction-solution process, a cover for the assassination of ‘difficult’people, and a means to destabilise societies. At the hearing into the death ofAldo Moro, several members of the Red Brigade said they knew of high level USinvolvement in his murder. On November 10th 1982, the court heard devastatingtestimony from a close associate of Moro, Gorrado Guerzoni. He said that a topUnited States politician had threatened Moro that unless he changed his policieshe would be dealt with. Moro wanted to stabilise Italy, the US politician wantedto destabilise her. Aldo Moro’s wife, in her evidence, also said that a “highranking United States political figure” had told her husband: “Either you stopyour political line or you will pay dearly for it”. Who was the man that GorradoGuerzoni named in court?Henry Kissinger.This was widely reported in Italy, but not a single word appeared in the NewYork Times or the Washington Post, even though one of America’s most famouspeople had been accused in a court of law with involvement in the death of aleading foreign politician kidnapped and murdered by a terrorist gang. Freepress? Sure there is. When Moro was kidnapped, the Italian government refused tonegotiate his release. This was strange because they had negotiated when othershad been abducted. His family could not understand it at the time. It was as ifthe authorities didn’t want him released. The truth was that they didn’t. TheElite conspiracy does not have an allegiance to one country or political system.It has its members in all parties and countries and they cooperate for theircommon aims. To them borders and countries do not exist, except as a means toplay one side against another.Two significant names found on the P2 membership list were the financiers,Roberto Calvi and Michele Sindona. It was while investigating the fakekidnapping of Sindona and his work as financial advisor to the Vatican and theMafia that the police uncovered Gelli’s P2 scandal. The Roman Catholic Churchhad long outlawed Freemasonry within its ranks, although many of its clergy andofficials are members. During the period of Gelli, however, when officialVatican hostility to Freemasonry was significantly reduced, the P2 Lodge tookover the Papal State through the infiltration by Gelli, Calvi, and Sindona. ThePope through these years of P2 infiltration was Pope Paul VI and it was he whoreduced the opposition to Freemasonry within the Roman Catholic Church.Interestingly, a Canadian publisher, Daniel Scallen, employed the PinkertonDetective Agency of New York to investigate the Pope’s behaviour. A detectivewent to Rome in 1973 and reported that there were two Pope Pauls in the Vatican!He reckoned that plastic surgery had been used to make an impostor resemble thePope. When you see different close-up pictures of the Pope from this time, it iscertainly feasible. There do appear to be distinct differences. Tapes of thePope’s speeches at Christmas and Easter were analysed by the FBI and found to bethe voices of different people. During his investigations, the Pope’s nieceadmitted to the detective that there was indeed an impostor, and his family (whovisited the real Pope regularly at the Vatican) was aware of this, she said. Theinvestigation ended when the detective was arrested in Rome and sentenced tofour years in prison. He was later deported and then ‘disappeared’. There weresome who found it far-fetched when I said in The Robots’ Rebellion thatlook-alikes were used for some public figures. It isn’t, you know. It has nowbeen shown that the Saddam Hussein we saw after the Gulf War was not the sameman we saw before the war. It was a plastic-surgery-created look-alike.10When the P2 scandal broke, top ranking Vatican officials were implicated,including the Secretary of State, Cardinal Villot. It was Villot, according toStephen Knight’s book, The Brotherhood, who many believe applied pressure on theRoman Catholic hierarchy to tone down its opposition to Freemasonry. He was alsonamed, in another investigation by David Yallop called In God’s Name, as a primesuspect in the murder of Pope John Paul I, who died after only 33 days in officein 1978. This Pope perhaps knew something of what was going on, both in terms ofFreemasonry infiltration and the stealing of Vatican wealth. The ‘Christian’wing of the All-Seeing Eye cult wants to infiltrate and destroy Christianity inthe same way its Jewish membership are working to undermine Judaism. Maybe PopeJohn Paul I was determined to act to bring an end to the manipulation, althoughothers say he was an Illuminati Pope. Anyway, he was found dead, murdered byagents of P2, and this was covered up with lies about ‘natural causes’. Thedoctors who were allowed to examine him appeared confused, with each suggestinga different cause – heart attack, cancer, and brain tumour. Take your pick. Manybelieve he was poisoned, but the truth was never investigated by theauthorities. He was found dead at 5.30am and by 9.30am his body had beenembalmed and his intestines removed and burnt. There was no post mortem.Standsfield Turner (CFR), the former CIA director, said that Pope John Paul’spersonal physician, one of the first to examine his body, was an asset of theCIA. Cardinal Villot himself died in 1979 before the P2 story was exposed. Inthe period leading up to his death, he said that he would reveal the story ofthe Pope’s demise, but he never did. The doctors who were allowed to examineVillot gave the cause of death as bronchial-pneumonia…sorry, kidney trouble…no,hold on, hepatitis…no, er, internal haemorrhage. Remind me not to call theVatican if I ever need a doctor.Michele Sindona, the P2 member, financial swindler, money launderer, and laterconvicted murderer, became involved with the Vatican bank, L’Istituto per leOpere di Religione (IOR) and introduced his partner, Roberto Calvi, to thebank’s chief, Bishop Paul Marcinkus. Calvi had his own bank, Ambrosiano, inwhich the Vatican bank became a major shareholder, thanks to the Freemasonicconnections and Gelli’s close relationship with the top officials and the Pope.A massive fraud ensued and when Banco Ambrosiano collapsed in 1982, it had debtsof £800,000,000. The Vatican bank paid creditors £164,000,000 which created acash crisis for the Roman Catholic Church, similar to the one faced by theprotestant Church of England in more recent years.Roberto Calvi, who became known, as did Sindona, as ‘God’s Banker’, fled toAustria and then England, where he arrived on June 15th 1982. Two days later hissecretary, Graziella Corrocher, who kept the books for P2, ‘fell’ from a fourthfloor window at the Ambrosiano Bank. The following day Calvi was dead, too. Hewas found hanged from scaffolding under Blackfriars Bridge in London, with hispockets full of masonry, four miles from the Chelsea Cloisters where he wasstaying.Even as his body was being found and reported, Italian police and otherofficials were chartering a plane to England. They need not have been so hasty,there were plenty of Freemasons within the London authorities who could cover uphis murder. A City of London Inquest announced a verdict of suicide, whichbeggars belief. A man who wants to kill himself leaves his apartment, where thedeed could have been done, travels to Blackfriars Bridge and despite sufferingfrom extreme vertigo, he climbs down onto scaffolding underneath the archeswhich he could not have known was there. He then somehow rigs up the rope, fillshis pockets with rubble, and hangs himself. Yeah, sounds feasible. A secondinquest in June 1983 returned an open verdict, which at least was a little moresensible, though far from the outcome the evidence demanded.There was certainly Freemasonic symbolism involved in his death and the Masonslove their symbolism. Blackfriars was once the site of a friary church run by aDominican Order who were called Blackfriars because of the black habits theywore. It was they who expanded the use of pulpits, hence the pulpit is a themein the stonework on Blackfriars Bridge. Members of the P2 lodge dressed likeBlackfriars for their rituals. Also, one of the masonic penalties talks of thevictim being “…buried in the sand of the sea at low water mark, or a cable’slength from the shore, where the tide regularly ebbs and flows twice in twentyfour hours…”. One tarot card depiction of death is also a man hanged besidewater. Whatever the detailed background, Calvi was clearly murdered, either forwhat he had done or for what he knew about what had happened. It was probablyboth. And that is the penalty faced by many Freemasons who have outlived theirusefulness.It would be nice to think that the P2 scandal was an isolated case, but I do notbelieve that to be so. Yet to be uncovered in most countries (certainly in themost influential ones) are, I have no doubt, similar cells of elite Freemasonscreating and controlling a state within a state. I do not accept, either, thateven the P2 has ceased to exist, nor that the Elite’s control of the Vatican hasbeen purged. One other point is the name itself, P2. That indicates thatsomewhere there must be a P1. But where? Almost certainly the United States, orthe United Kingdom, possibly both.The Knights of MaltaDuring the period of the Crusades in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries whenthe Pope tried to remove the Muslims from Jerusalem, a number of ‘Knights’orders emerged. They included the Knights Templar (Knights of the Temple) andthe Order of Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem. Both sufferedpersecution after the Crusades failed, but the Knights Templar survive to thisday and their creed formed the basis of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry withits 33 degrees. The Order of St John of Jerusalem changed its name with itschanges of location. It became the Knights of Rhodes when it was given theisland by the Pope and then the Knights of Malta, which it ruled as a sovereignstate until the Order was removed by Napoleon in 1798. After a period of nomadicexistence, or so their official history says, Pope Leo XII (a dogmatic Catholicextremist) established a new headquarters for the Order in Rome in 1834. Todaythey are called the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and they enjoy all thediplomatic rights of a head of state. More than forty countries recognise theirsovereignty and have full diplomatic relations with this official, andoh-so-accurately described, state within a state. By Papal Decree, theinternational head of the Order, the Grand Master, has the rank of prince, theimportance of a cardinal, and the title Most Eminent Highness. The overallchief, officially at least, is the Pope.The Knights of Malta are major powerbrokers within the Elite network, with closeties to the Black Nobility and world politics, not the least in the UnitedStates. Alexander Haig (CFR), the secretary of state in the Reaganadministration, is a member and some believe Reagan may have been. ValérieGiscard d’Estaing, the former president of France, was also a member. It wasd’Estaing (Bil) and former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt (Bil), who did somuch together to promote European integration.11 The Order has particularlyclose links with the security services like the CIA. In 1948, it gave one of itsmost prestigious awards of honour to General Reinhard Gehlen, who was AdolfHitler’s head of anti-Soviet espionage. After the war, Gehlen was hired by thenewly created CIA to organise its operations in Europe! CIA directors known tobe Knights of Malta have been John McCone and William Casey, and so was GeorgeRocca, a deputy chief of CIA counter-intelligence. The Knights of Malta werealmost certainly involved in the guns-for-drugs Iran-Contra affair in the US,which brought Oliver North to world public attention. North was represented atthe hearings by the law firm of Bennett Williams, a Knight of Malta. One of theAmericans who intervened to ensure that selected Nazi personnel escaped fromGermany to the United States after the war was the industrialist, J. PeterGrace, the one-time American head of the Knights of Malta.This Order is an ultra-extreme authoritarian organisation which connects withthe highest levels of the Elite web. Research by the writer, Betty Mills, forher 1990 book, Colonel North, William Casey, And The Knights Of Malta, revealsthat in the 1930s there was an attempted coup by the Order in America. At thecentre of this was the Knight of Malta, John J. Raskob, but it failed whenMarine General Smedley Butler refused to take part and instead produced evidenceof the plan. He implicated Raskob, board chairman of the J.P. Morgan-controlledGeneral Motors, and one of the thirteen founders of the Knights of Malta in theUnited States. Congressional hearings were held, but amazingly, or perhaps notso amazingly, Raskob was never called to testify. And, as Betty Mills says: “Itis interesting and at the same time very disturbing to note that the 1930s plotto seize the White House is not to be found in history books or encyclopedias asfar as we can tell”.12 Who controls the media and the official versions ofhistory? Correct.Once more we see how the Knights of Malta cross-reference with the other piecesin the puzzle, including the media. William F. Buckley, the publisher andoilman, is a member of the Skull and Bones Society, the Council on ForeignRelations, and the Knights of Malta. Frank Shakespeare, another Knight, waspresident of CBS Television, vice-chairman of RKO, and the United Statesambassador to the Vatican. Shakespeare has also served on the Elite-controlledHeritage Foundation under the ultra-right chairmanship of Paul Weyrich. This haslinks to the Habsburg family, one of the driving forces behind the Pan EuropeanMovement which led to the European Community, and a key family within the GlobalElite. The social historian Stephen Birmingham says: “The Knights of Maltacomprise what is perhaps the most exclusive club on Earth. They are more thanthe Catholic aristocracy…[they] can pick up the telephone and chat with thePope”.13 I would go further than that and say they control the Vatican in leaguewith other Elite elements and, far from being the Catholic aristocracy, they arenot even Catholic. This is only a cover for their activities and they worship avery different version of ‘god’, the Luciferic Consciousness symbolised by thePyramid and All-Seeing Eye. The Vatican was controlled by the Elite via theKnights of Malta before Gelli’s P2 got involved. Indeed, Gelli was a member ofthe Knights of Malta.The present Pope and official head of the Knights of Malta is the Pole, KarolWojtyla, a former actor and employee of I.G. Farben. He has had one attempt onhis life, which might have been a warning to “do as you’re told or else”. It’sdifficult to say. Certainly he carries with him the bent or broken cross,depicting the distorted figure of Jesus. This was an invention by Satanists inthe fifth century and used by black magicians. It was outlawed in the MiddleAges. In 1978, the year that Pope John Paul I was murdered and Pope John Paul IItook over the papacy, a set of Vatican stamps was issued featuring a pyramid andan all-seeing eye.The Orange Order and Sinn FeinBehind the ongoing conflicts in the world’s trouble spots you will find theGlobal Elite secret society network manipulating both sides. The news is full ofstories about “freedom fighters” and “arms struggles” around the world. Most ofthe people involved believe they are fighting for “freedom” in their country orcommunity when they are really being used as part of a coordinated globalrevolution to destroy communities and nation states on the road to worldgovernment. In Northern Ireland, the arms struggle has cost the lives of 3,000people on both ‘sides’ of the so called Catholic and Protestant Divide. At thelower levels, there is no doubt that two perceived ‘sides’ exist if only in theminds of those involved. But the Protestant political and paramilitary groupsare underpinned by a secret society, the Orange Order. This is the same secretsociety controlled by the Black Nobility that put King William of Orange on theBritish throne and imported the Dutch central banking system to Britain in theform of the Bank of England. The Catholic political and paramilitary wings arealso part of the secret society network and far from “fighting for freedom”,they are a Lansky-style organised crime syndicate. Why, at the highest level,can’t they have been working together all along to play one side against theother in classic modified Hegel fashion while at the same time projecting at thepublic mind a belief in two deeply opposing forces? Pollard’s The SecretSocieties Of Ireland says that the force behind the revolutions of Europe hadIreland in its sights:> “These emissaries from France aimed at bringing England low, and spreading the> doctrine of world-revolution by means of an alliance between the Catholic> malcontents of the South and the Republican Presbyterians of the North.”One vehicle for the Irish strand of the world-revolution was the IrishBrotherhood, later the United Irishmen, founded by the Freemasons, Wolfe Toneand Napper Tandy in 1791. The writer and researcher of the eighteenth and earlynineteenth century, Robert Clifford, said that the Irish revolutionary networkmaintained contacts with similar international movements through the IlluministJacobin Club in Paris (a force behind the French Revolution), the RevolutionarySociety in England, and the Scottish Committee of Reform. The Fenian Society,later the Irish Republican Brotherhood, was formed between 1857 and 1858 underthe guidance of James Stephens who, from the start, saw this Brotherhood as apart of the much wider European revolutionary movement. Fenians travelled toParis to study the methods of the Carbonari, the Italian Elite-Brotherhoodnetwork, very closely connected to the Black Nobility. In 1865, the Feniansjoined the secret society network under Karl Marx known as the InternationalWorking Mens’ Association and founded the Irish Brotherhood in London onSeptember 28th 1864, which, with help from the American Fenian Brotherhood, wasnot primarily designed to win democracy, freedom and justice for the Irishpeople. It was created to exploit their thoroughly understandable sense ofinjustice to further the world (Elite) revolution. Marx saw Ireland as animportant weapon to undermine England and it has been used that way ever sincewith the Irish people as the pawns of the manipulators on both ‘sides’. RobertClifford wrote:> “What unhappy deluded people then were the lower associates, who were informed> of nothing, but were to be mere agents of rebellion and murder, and were> hurried on into the abyss of horrors by a few political liberties who grasped> at dominion, and wished to wade to the helm of the state through the blood of> their countrymen! …In those parts where the whole population was Catholic,> hand bills were distributed, purporting to be the Constitution of the Orange> Men, which was death and destruction to every Catholic; for, if the common> people could once be stirred up to rebellion, it was easy to turn their minds> against government as the centre of the Orange Men.”Meanwhile, you say something similar to the Protestants about the Catholicleaders and, bingo, you have the horror of Ireland throughout the twentiethcentury. It is classic modified Hegelianism or, you might also say, Kissingerismor Harrimanism (Figure 10). The secret society network in Ireland is phenomenalfor such a small population and it is this which led to the creation of SinnFein in 1905, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Thisnetwork is, in turn, connected to the web controlled by the Global Elite and itis through this that the well-documented links between the IRA and otherterrorist groups have been coordinated. The New Covenant Times said in itsJanuary/March 1994 edition, that the loyalist paramilitary movement wasdeliberately backed by an MI5 operation called “Tara” with the intention ofcreating so much violence and tit-for-tat murder by both the IRA and Protestantloyalist paramilitary, that the UK Parliament would agree to allow NorthernIreland to be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland.[../Images/00003.jpg]Figure 10Some of the background to this came out in the story of Colin Wallace, thesubject of a book by the journalist, Paul Foot, called Who Framed Colin Wallace?He was a part-time soldier and an outstanding public relations officer at thearmy headquarters in Northern Ireland. Later he was moved to another departmentunder the control of MI5. It was a department dealing with the promotion ofdisinformation. Here Wallace became aware of the “Tara” operation and its linksto the suppression over 20 years of the history of child sexual abuse at theKincora Boys’ Home. When Wallace asked to be removed from the project, he wasimmediately sent to England and charged with a ‘security offence’. Later he wascharged with murder. I have nothing in common with most views expounded by MPEnoch Powell (Bil) over the years, but on one thing I believe him to be entirelycorrect: that not only was Wallace framed by the establishment, his treatmentimplicated individuals at every level, from the Cabinet Office to juniorpolicemen and civil servants. The conflict in Northern Ireland has a very muchwider background than we have been led to believe14 and a source within the UKestablishment who worked on Northern Ireland related projects, told me that thecatholic and protestant parliamentary leaderships meet to discuss strategies! Iam sure something similar has been happening in the Middle East as the ‘peace’negotiators, Arafat and the late Prime Minister Rabin, combined to offer thePalestinians the ‘gift’ of long-term slavery dressed up as ‘freedom’.The Skull and Bones SocietyThis is an important society within the Elite pyramid which has tremendousinfluence within the United States. It is run with the strictest secrecy fromits headquarters at Yale University, in a windowless mausoleum appropriatelyknown as ‘The Tomb’ where the members meet twice a week during term time. Thedetailed history of the Skull and Bones is a mystery, but it is believed to havebeen introduced into the US more than 150 years ago as Chapter 322 of a Germansecret society and was also known at one time as the Brotherhood of Death. TheIlluminati in disguise. The symbolism of the initiation ceremony would appear toindicate at least close links with Freemasonry. It was started in 1832–1833 byGeneral William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft, a famous American familyname. In 1876, Taft was to be the Secretary of War in the Grant Administrationand his son, William Howard Taft, was the only man to be both President andChief Justice of the United States. The Skull and Bones Society is deeply racistand was founded on the fortune made from illegal drugs. The society wasincorporated in 1856 as the Russell Trust and by a special act of statelegislation, its trustees are exempted from filing corporate reports to theConnecticut authorities.The initiation ceremonies for the Skull and Bones still take place at DeerIsland in the St Lawrence River. The island is owned by the Russell TrustAssociation, along with most of the land on which Yale University stands. TheRussell family made its enormous wealth from the opium trade in the nineteenthcentury through the drug syndicate known as Russell and Company. Its businesswas to take opium from Turkey and transport it illegally to China. Their onlyrivals were the Perkins syndicate, based in Boston, which had intermarried withother families of the British genetic line who had previously been involved inthe slave trade.The Russells eventually bought out the Perkins and became the centre of the USopium racket, in league with other ‘blueblood’ families like Coolidge and Delano(Comm 300 family designate), both of which produced Presidents of the UnitedStates. The head of Russell and Co in Canton while all this drug racketeeringwas going on was Warren Delano Jr, the grandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.These American families also connected with British families involved in theopium trade like the Keswicks (Jardine Matheson) and many others supported bythe British governments of Lord Palmerston, the symbolic head of Grand OrientFreemasonry. The Keswicks and Jardine Matheson have been members of theCommittee of 300. Given the source of its creation, therefore, it was only rightthat the Skull and Bones Society was launched with a pirate’s flag as itssymbol.The link between the Skull and Bones and the families of the EasternEstablishment named throughout this book was to continue to the presentday…names like Bush, Rockefeller, Harriman, Whitney, Payne, Vanderbilt, Bundy,and so on. The writer, Anthony C. Sutton, acquired copies of Skull and Bonesmembership lists going back to 1832.15 About 20–30 families, overwhelmingly fromthe Eastern seaboard, dominate the Order. Most claim ancestry with the Britisharistocracy or have a genetic line going back to the English Puritan familieswho arrived in America around 1630–1660. These families either secured financialpower themselves or married into wealth via the sons of the moguls like theRockefellers and Harrimans. One side had the money; the other had the genes fromthe perceived elite bloodlines of the ‘Mother Country’. It is not only in Asiathat they have arranged marriages. In these Anglo-American families it is doneto protect or ‘advance’ the genetic lines of the pseudo-bluebloods who owe theorigins of their inherited wealth and influence to drug running, slavery, andcarefully chosen marriage partners. These intermingled families help and supporteach other in their quest for financial, political, and genetic dominance.A big Skull and Bones family is the Lords of the well known New York law firm,Lord, Day, and Lord. Their present clients include the New York Times and theRubin Foundation, which funds the Elite’s Institute for Policy Studies inWashington. Winston Lord (TC, Bil) became the chairman of the Council on ForeignRelations in 1983. The Bush clan are well represented, too, in the Skull andBones. Prescott Bush was initiated in 1917 and then married into the family offinanciers and wheeler dealers, the Walkers.16 George Herbert Walker Jr wasanother Skull and Bones man. In 1948, Prescott’s son, George Herbert WalkerBush, joined the Order, a move that would be exceedingly helpful in his climb tobecome head of the CIA and president of the United States. Pat Buchanan, one ofBush’s challengers at the Presidential election, accused him of running “a Skulland Bones Presidency”. Yale and the Skull and Bones are also recruiting groundsfor the CIA and it was from his student days that Bush almost certainly beganhis career with the Elite-controlled spy agency.His father Prescott Bush is most famous within the Order for raiding the graveof the Native American Apache leader, Geronimo. In May 1918, Bush and five otherSkull and Bones members ransacked the grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. They tookturns to stand guard while the others robbed the grave, and took away artifactsand Geronimo’s skull. This was taken to Skull and Bones headquarters at Yalewhere it is used in their sick rituals and ceremonies. This horrible story istold in an internal history of the Skull and Bones Society. It was quoted to NedAnderson, the Tribal Chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, when he wasnegotiating to have Geronimo’s remains returned to the tribe’s custody. A 1989article in the New Yorker said that “one Bonesman…recalled during the early 70sseeing perhaps 30 skulls, not all of them human, scattered about the Tomb”.This is the mentality which goes on to enjoy positions of power within theAmerican administration – in George Bush’s case, the presidency. Once again itis a mentality, a vibratory state, that can be locked into the Prison Wardersfrequency. Fifteen students a year are hand picked to join the Skull and Bones.They are selected in their junior year, but only become members in their senioryear before they go off into the outside world. They can then continue tosecretly promote the aims of the Skull and Bones in the worlds of politics,business, banking, the media, education, and all the other spheres of influence.Fear and the threat of blackmail are weapons the society uses to keep itsmembers in line. Part of the initiation ceremony is to lie naked in a coffinwith a ribbon tied to their private parts while they masturbate and shout outdetails of their sexual experiences. I must say I have never seen George Bush inthe same light since I realised that. Apparently these sexual discussionscontinue throughout the lives of Bonesmen, although only at the initiation is itdone from a coffin. When a student is initiated, he is given his Skull and Bonesname. He becomes a ‘knight’ in the tradition of other secret societies like theKnights of Malta. The older knights in the S and B are called Patriarchs, andthose of us on the outside – the masses – are called Gentiles, barbarians, andvandals.If you look at the period of the Russian Revolution to the end of the SecondWorld War alone, you can appreciate how the Skull and Bones has been a commontheme throughout these years of conflict and manipulation. On the board of theMorgan Guaranty Trust Company which helped to fund the Bolshevik Revolution,maintain the Soviet dictatorship, and fund both sides in the two world wars, youfind nine members of the Skull and Bones Society, including W. Averell Harriman,Harry P. Whitney, Knight Woolley, and Percy Rockefeller. On the board of W. A.Harriman (Brown Brothers, Harriman from 1933) were eight members of the Skulland Bones, among them W.A. Harriman, E. Roland Harriman, Knight Woolley, andPrescott Bush. Very obviously, the Skull and Bones Society was, and is, animportant means of coordinating the Elite operations. Averell Harriman is aprime example of how Skull and Bones members have orchestrated the direction ofthe United States and the world, but many of the Americans I have mentioned inthis book are members of the S and B. Its members have been behind the eugenicsmovement, the creation of the World Council of Churches, and the American CivilWar (in which the Skull and Bonesmen worked with the Rothschilds, who had anagent on each side, Judah Benjamin and August Belmont).I have in Figure 11 (overleaf) fitted together the overall structure into theglobal pyramid of control. I do not claim for a moment that this is 100%accurate. We are talking of a force shrouded in secrecy and disinformation,after all. But it will give you some idea of how it fits together. It wasconstructed by the Elite with control of the following in mind: governments andpoliticians; political opinions of all shades; the economic system; the worldmilitary; the media; the intelligence agencies; public opinion manipulation;‘health’ – the pharmaceutical industry; the illegal drugs network; populationcontrol – eugenics; education; food production; and so forth. Theseinterconnecting elements hang together on a structure controlled from the top.It involves the covert infiltration of the authorities which guide the directionof society and the covert manipulation and coordination by key Elite satellitesin the centre of the structure like the Round Table and the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. All these threads and lines of command eventually feedinto the United Nations and its ever mushrooming network of agencies and power.I do not wish to give the impression that this network is all powerful, nor thatit manipulates without internal pressures and strife. The network can onlycontrol and manipulate the mass of the people if we cooperate with it. If wecease to concede our right to think for ourselves and stop cooperating with thecontrollers, their ‘power’ is no more. Also, the Elite do not always agree oneverything. One long-time researcher into the New World Order said the Elitewere like a gang of bank robbers. They agree on the crime, but they argue overthe methods and the division of the spoils. I think such pressures will play amajor role in its imminent destruction.One name in the diagram there which you may not have heard of is the TavistockInstitute of Human Relations, 120 Belsize Lane, London NW3 5BA, which, accordingto many books and investigators, tops the network of mass mind manipulationresearch establishments and its findings are used to direct the policies of theGlobal Elite network. In 1921, just as the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs and the Council on Foreign Relations were being formed, the Duke ofBedford, Marquess of Tavistock, gave one of his buildings for research into theeffects of shellshock on British soldiers in the First World War. This wascarried out under the direction of the British Army Bureau of PsychologicalWarfare under Sir John Rawlings-Reece (Comm 300). A student of Sir JohnRawlings-Reece was Henry Kissinger. It was Tavistock, according to researcherslike Eustace Mullins and others, that introduced the drug culture of the 1960s;and designed the mass bombing raids on civilians during the Second World War tobreak the spirit of the people. Mind manipulation and brainwashing will also beused on people useful to the Global Elite to ‘encourage’ them to see the worldin the required manner.17The Tavistock nexus has grown far and wide and links into the Club of Rome andthe Bilderberg network. It connects with the Ditchley Foundation, which wasfounded in 1957 by Sir Philip Adams, a long time employee of the British ForeignOffice, which is in turn controlled by the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs and the Bilderberg group. In the United States, the Tavistock networkincludes the Stanford Institute, the Institute for Social Relations, the HudsonInstitute, the Heritage Foundation, the Hoover Institution, the Centre forStrategic Studies at Georgetown, and the Rand Corporation (which has ZbigniewBrzezinski among its number). This mind control network is itself linked (withthe tax-exempt foundations) into the education system, including the businessand banking schools which develop methods of controlling people through thefinancial system. Again the overwhelming majority of people involved will haveno idea where the directives and policies really originate. The BrookingsInstitution in the US is responsible for developing policies to manipulate thepopulation through the money system, and so is the Mont Pelerin Society. Aleading light of this, and of the Hoover Institution, is economist MiltonFriedman, the inspiration of the monetarism disaster introduced by thosepolitical puppets, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, in the 1980s.[../Images/00004.jpg]Figure 11You’ll note also that the whole structure not only connects from the top, down;the various elements connect crossways too. There are infinitely more link-upsand organisations involved than I have mentioned in the diagram. Within most ofthese organisations, the lower levels will not know what they are being used forand it is important to recognise that the system of compartmentalisation and the‘need to know’ principle means that the different levels are following differentagendas. At the lower levels within the CIA, British Intelligence, and the KGB,they would have been genuinely fighting the Cold War. Their agents in the fieldwould have been spying on each other in the belief that East and West were swornenemies. But at the higher levels, they had another agenda because they knewthat the Cold War was a sham to serve Elite ambitions. These multidimensionalagendas controlled by the all-knowing Elite continue within the economic,political, and military systems today and while most of the people involved inthe Global Pyramid don’t realise what they are part of, the mindset establishedat the top sets the agenda that filters down through all the levels. You couldcall this the ‘culture of corruption’ that we see so often in society, even inthe lower echelons of business, the police, and politics.Throughout this pyramid there is one common and all-pervading force, guide, andmotivation. It decides the policy and holds the strings of those who manipulateour lives. This force is the guiding light, or rather darkness, which controlsthe thinking and the direction of those at the top of this Pyramid of Deceit.

At this top level, they are knowinglyinteracting with this force, which probably takes many forms. There is evidencethat many people involved over the years have believed they were working forextraterrestrial ‘super men’. Some may have had face-to-face contact with anegative ET group from the Fourth Dimension.To understand the true nature of the conspiracy, we need to appreciate itsesoteric foundation. Esoteric knowledge, often called ‘the occult’, is notnegative in or of itself. It is just the knowledge of the potential to harnessthe energies of Creation for good or ill, and the understanding of the humanpsyche and how it can be balanced, healed, or manipulated. It is not theknowledge that is good or bad; it is the way we use it. People at the highestlevels of the Elite-Illuminati-Brotherhood network are often members of extremesects based on ancient rites and Lucifer/Satan worship. Yes, Satanists run theworld. If you infiltrated some of these bizarre gatherings, I am sure you wouldsee some very famous faces. The security services such as the CIA and USMilitary Intelligence, are seriously infiltrated by sects that worship thesevarious names for the Prison Warder consciousness. Lieutenant-Colonel MichaelAquino, a senior officer within US Military Intelligence, formed the Temple ofSet, but when this was made public, the authorities said they saw no problem.During the Second World War, the Elite’s esoteric tradition was at work on bothsides.President Roosevelt, who was a 33rd degree Freemason, also had the esotericname, the Knight of Pythias, and wore the red fez of the Ancient Arabic Order ofNobles of the Mystic Shrine. This organisation claimed to be connected with theIlluminati.1 Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, was a Freemason andhad several meetings with the Satanist Aleister Crowley, another esoteric guruand a high initiate of many orders, including the Order of the Golden Dawn andthe Order of Oriental Templars (more on him later). Churchill’s meetings withCrowley do not, of course, constitute proof that the British Prime Minister wasa Satanist, but it does show that behind the scenes, esoteric knowledge in allof its forms is taken far more seriously than it is in public. This was the caseduring Elizabethan times and has been throughout human history.The two greatest creations of the black magicians in the twentieth century havebeen the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. If I take the example of Adolf Hitlerand the Nazis you will get an idea of the mindset of those who control the Elitetoday. This story is not unique to Hitler’s Germany. Behind the public faces,its themes could be told again and again within regimes, both authoritarian and‘democratic’, across the world. Germany has long been a centre for esotericthinking and the secret societies this knowledge seems to spawn. It was fromthis philosophical stream that Hitler and his crazed followers would emerge. Oneof the pre-Hitler ‘prophets’ was the composer, Richard Wagner, in the nineteenthcentury. His composition, The Ride Of The Valkyries, captures his obsession withthe invading powers of evil. Wagner declared the imminent arrival of the MasterRace. His work, The Ring, was the musical expression of his belief in Germansupermen bestriding the world stage like the ancient pagan gods Wotan and Thor.Hitler would later say that to understand Nazi Germany, one had to know Wagner.One of the students of master race fanatic Wagner was Gustav Mahler, whosestudies with Wagner were funded by Baron Albert de Rothschild.Adolf Hitler was officially born at Braunau-am-Inn, on the border of Germany andthe Austria-Hungary empire, but the amazing story of who he really was will betold in a later book when I have compiled the evidence. The esoteric was tobecome a consuming passion for Hitler, especially in his rise to power. He wasstrongly influenced by the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, who was born inthe Ukraine in 1831. Some researchers claim she had connections with the secretsociety of Italian revolutionaries, the Carbonari, who were closely linked tothe Black Nobility, and she was a member of the Egyptian society, theBrotherhood of Luxor, which she later denounced as “a den for disgustingimmorality, greediness for selfish power, and money making”. Madame Blavatskyarrived in New York in 1873 and, with the help of a Colonel Henry Olcott shefounded the Theosophical Society two years later. This is still around today.Its doctrines are based on Blavatsky books such as Isis Unveiled, which waswritten in 1877, and The Secret Doctrine, published in 1888. She claimed to bein psychic contact with Hidden Masters or Supermen. These Hidden Masters, shesaid, lived in Central Asia and could be contacted telepathically by those whoknew the secrets to the esoteric mysteries. Today we call this process ofcommunication ‘channelling’. There are many UFO sightings and much researchwhich indicates that there are secret underground and underwater bases forextraterrestrials around the world, Central Asia among them. I am not sayingthat Blavatsky was negative, only that Hitler was influenced by her work.The belief in the Masters and the Great White Brotherhood of discarnate entitiespromoted by people like the Theosophical psychic of the post-Blavatsky period,Alice Bailey,2 is a theme that remains well entrenched in parts of what is knowntoday as the New Age Movement. Alice Bailey claimed to ‘channel’ an entity shecalled “The Tibetan” and she produced a number of books, including Hierarchy OfThe Masters, The Seven Rays, A New Group Of World Servers, and New WorldReligion. She said that her Tibetan Master had told her the Second World War wasnecessary to defend the plan of God. That sounds ridiculous to me, but there aremany in the New Age field who believe that everything is meant to be and is thewill of God, even a global holocaust. It seems like a great excuse to do nothingand a cop-out of mega proportions.My own view is that the ‘Masters’, ‘The Great White Brotherhood’, and this wholeconcept is something to be very wary of. Whenever I hear the term ‘master’ Icringe. Two organisations linked to Alice Bailey’s work, the Lucis Trust and theWorld Goodwill organisation, are both staunch promoters of the United Nations –almost UN ‘groupies’, such is their devotion. I will discuss these further in alater chapter. The more I go into this, it is interesting to see how the New Agehas inherited ‘truths’ over the decades in the same way that conventionalreligion has done over the centuries. As the followers of Christianity haveinherited the manipulated version of Jesus, so New Agers have inherited the‘Masters’. There is too little checking of origins, too much acceptance ofinherited beliefs, I think. If the New Age isn’t careful, it will beChristianity revisited. It is already becoming so. I believe this concept ofMasters can be a means through which those who have (quite rightly in my view)rejected the status quo of religion and science can still have their mindscontrolled by the Prison Warders of the Fourth Dimension.Another big influence on Hitler was the novel, The Coming Race, by theEnglishman, Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), a British Colonial Ministerheavily involved in imposing opium addiction on the Chinese. He was a closefriend of Disraeli and Dickens, and Grand Patron of the English RosicrucianSociety which included Francis Bacon and John Dee in its earlier membership.Bulwer-Lytton is best known for his work, The Last Days Of Pompeii, but hispassion was the world of esoteric magic and, as a British colonial minister, forrunning opium to the Chinese. In The Coming Race, he wrote of an enormouscivilisation inside the Earth, well ahead of our own. They had discovered apower called Vril which, by the use of the psyche, could be used to perform‘miracles’. These underground supermen would, according to Bulwer-Lytton’snovel, emerge on the surface one day and take control of the world. Many Nazisbelieved this. Lord Bulwer-Lytton is often referred to by Madame Blavatsky inher book, Isis Unveiled. The themes of underground supermen or hidden masterscan be found in most of the esoteric secret societies. Certainly this was trueof The Order of the Golden Dawn, formed in 1888 by Dr Wynn Westcott, aFreemason, and S.L. Mathers. They called their ‘masters’ the ‘Secret Chiefs’.The theme of extraterrestrials living underground fits in with the 1960s surveyof contactees which detailed the stories of the pure Melchedekan race with theirblond hair and blue eyes. They were also said to be living inside the Earth.Mathers devised a series of rituals and initiations and designed them to helphis members access their full psychic and physical potential. He believed,however, that this gift was only for the few and he was a supporter ofauthoritarian government. These rituals, no doubt, would have attracted the darkenergies which allowed vibrational synchronisation – possession – by theWarders. In the mid-1890s, there were temples of the Order in London, Edinburgh,Bradford, Weston-Super-Mare, and Paris, where Mathers made his home. The Orderof the Golden Dawn also spoke of the vril force and one of the Order’s secretsigns was the salute which the Nazis would use when saying “Heil Hitler”. Theesoteric foundations on which Nazism was created continued to build. Mathers hadknown Madame Blavatsky and so had the master of the Order’s London Temple, thepoet, William Butler Yeats, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize. Yeat’s view ofUtopia mirrored that of Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin. The poet spoke of:> “…an aristocratic civilisation in its most completed form, every detail of> life hierarchical, every great man’s door crowded at dawn by petitioners,> great wealth everywhere in few men’s hands, all dependent upon a few, up to> the Emperor himself, who is a God dependent upon a greater God and everywhere,> in Court, in the family, an inequality made law.” 3Remnants of the Order of the Golden Dawn continue to this day, but the originalversion splintered after a row between Yeats, Mathers, and Aleister Crowley,which split the membership into quarrelling factions. Other significant esotericthinkers and groups which influenced the gathering Nazi philosophy included theOrder of the Oriental Temple, which used sex as part of its rituals to createand harness the energy known as the vril, and two German esoteric ‘magicians’,Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. In his summer solstice celebrations,List used wine bottles on the ground to form the symbol of the Hermetic Cross,also known as the Hammer of Thor. It was the Badge of Power in the Order of theGolden Dawn, and we know this symbol as the swastika. Lanz von Liebenfels (realname Adolf Lanz) featured the swastika on the flag which flew over his ‘temple’overlooking the Danube, and for these two black magicians it symbolised the endof Christianity and the dawning of the age of the Aryan supermen. They believedin the racial inferiority of those they called the “dark forces” such as theJews, the Slavs, and the Negroes. Liebenfels recommended castration for thesepeoples. The two vons, List and Liebenfels, were to have a massive influence onAdolf Hitler. In 1932, with Hitler on the verge of power, von Liebenfels wouldwrite to a fellow believer:> “Hitler is one of our pupils…You will one day experience that he, and through> him we, will one day be victorious, and develop a movement that will make the> world tremble…” 4Two others who would influence the thinking and beliefs of Adolf Hitler were theEnglishmen, Aleister Crowley and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Crowley was bornin Warwickshire in 1875. He rebelled against a strict religious upbringing andwas initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn in 1898, after leaving CambridgeUniversity. He left the Order after the row with its founders and then travelledto Mexico, India, and Ceylon, where he was introduced to yoga and Buddhism. Healso became a record-breaking mountaineer. Buddhism replaced his interest in theoccult until an experience in Cairo in April 1904. Crowley was asked by hiswife, Rose, to perform an esoteric ritual to see what happened. During theceremony, she entered a trance-like state and began to channel the words of acommunicator. “They are waiting for you”, she said to Crowley. The “they”, shesaid, was Horus, the god of war and the son of Osiris, in ancient Egyptianbelief. Crowley did not accept any of this and asked his wife a series ofdetailed questions in an effort to trick her. But Rose, who knew little of theesoteric, gave the correct answer every time. I believe the Prison Warders wereon the line again.The communicator told Crowley to be at a desk in his hotel room between noon andone o’clock on three specific days. He agreed and in these periods he wrote, viaautomatic writing, a document called The Book Of The Law. Automatic writing iswhen your arm and hand are guided by another force and often no-one is moresurprised at what they are writing than the person involved. Crowley’scommunication said that the old age of Osiris was being replaced by the new ageof Horus. But it said the old age would first have to be destroyed by barbarismand the Earth bathed in blood. There would be a World War, it said. The Book OfThe Law talked of a race of supermen and condemned the old religions, pacifism,democracy, compassion, and humanitarianism. “Let my servants be few and secret:they shall rule the many and the known” the ‘superman’ continued. The messagewent on:> “We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit; let them die in their misery.> For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings; stamp down the wretched> and the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of> the world…Love one another with burning hearts; on the low men trample in the> fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath…Pity not the fallen! I> never knew them. I am not for them. I console not; I hate the consoled and the> consoler…> “I am unique and conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned> and dead. Amen…Therefore strike hard and low, and to hell with them,> master…Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! This is the law of the Battle of Conquest:> thus shall my worship be about my secret house…Worship me with fire and blood;> worship me with swords and with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword> before me: let blood flow in my name. Trample down the heathen; be upon them,> O warrior, I will give you their flesh to eat…Sacrifice cattle, little and> big; after a child…kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!” 5If that sounds remarkably like some of the angry God stuff in the Old Testament,that’s because it was almost certainly the same force on the Fourth Dimensionwhich communicated to the ancients, to Crowley, and to anyone else on thatvibration who would help to stimulate the conflict and the energy of humanmisery, on which the Prison Warders feed. This is the force that controls theconsciousness of those which control the Global Elite-Illuminati-Brotherhood,and it is the focus of worship in the All-Seeing Eye cult going back to ancienttimes. The communicator said that Crowley was the “Beast 666” who had come todestroy Christianity, something his mother had said earlier in his life. Heapparently tried to ignore what he had written with his guided hand, but itwould not go away, and from 1909 on he began to take it seriously. Veryseriously. He said:> “After five years of folly and weakness, miscalled politeness, tact,> discretion, care for the feeling of others, I am weary of it. I say today: to> hell with Christianity, Rationalism, Buddhism, all the lumber of the> centuries. I bring you a positive and primeval fact, Magic by name; and with> this I will build me a new Heaven and new Earth. I want none of your faint> approval or faint dispraise; I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution,> anything, bad or good, but strong.”Crowley left his former tutor, MacGregor Mathers, a broken man as he embarked ona psychic war against him. They both conjured up the ‘demons’ to attack theother, but Mathers lost out. Such psychic wars are very much part of theBrotherhood today. Crowley’s communicator, the Prison Warder consciousness,would also take over the psyches of Adolf Hitler and the other architects ofNazism. Long after his death, Crowley would become a hero to many involved inthe ‘Flower Power’ period of the 1960s, when the young were calling for love andpeace. The irony is not lost. Crowley welcomed the First World War as necessaryto sweep away the old age and usher in the new one. After going public with hisrevelations, Crowley was made the world head of the Germany-based Order of theOriental Temple (OTO) and this gave him very significant influence amonglike-thinkers in Germany.Houston Stewart Chamberlain (Comm 300) was born in England in 1855, but moved toGermany in 1882. He married Eva, the daughter of Richard Wagner, in 1908 andbecame a prestigious writer. His best known work was Foundations Of TheNineteenth Century which ran to twelve hundred pages and sold more than 250,000copies. It made him famous throughout the country. He was, however, a troubledman who had a series of nervous breakdowns. He felt himself to be taken over bydemons and his books were written in a trance and a fever, which suggests thathe was locked into another highly negative consciousness. The Prison Warderconsciousness again. In his autobiography, he said he did not recognise much ofhis writing as his own. The themes of his work are very familiar: allcivilisation comes from the Aryan race and the Germans were the purest of all;Jews were the enemy who would pollute the Aryan bloodlines. Yawn.Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler said Chamberlain was a prophet. Chamberlainbecame the principal advisor to Kaiser Wilhelm and urged the king to go to warin 1914 to fulfil the prophecy of Germany’s world domination. When the war wasover and Wilhelm had abdicated to an estate in Holland, he realised how he hadbeen manipulated. He gathered together a mass of books on the occult and theGerman secret societies and he was convinced that they had conspired to createthe First World War and cause Germany to be defeated. Chamberlain, who had beenawarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser, died in 1927 after years in a wheelchair,broken in body and spirit. But his influence was to live on in the mind of AdolfHitler. Chamberlain, incidentally, was introduced to Hitler by Alfred Rosenberg,the refugee from Russia, and another satanist figure. “Satanism” is merely theworship of, and possession by, the negative manipulators on the FourthDimension. It was Rosenberg, despite his Jewish background, who gave a copy ofthe Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion to Hitler via another occultist,Dietrich Eckart.6 The All-Seeing Eye cult at work again.These were some of the people and beliefs that moulded the thinking of the manclaiming to be a young Austrian born with the name Schiklgruber, but laterrather better known as Adolf Hitler. “Heil Schiklgruber” would not have had thesame ring to it, somehow. He hated school, the official story goes, and wantedto be an artist, an ambition which took him to Vienna. He spent hours in thelibraries reading books on astrology, mysticism, and the religions of the East.He was fascinated by the books of Blavatsky, Chamberlain, List, and Liebenfels.He picked out bits from each of them to produce his preferred mixture, acocktail of horror and hatred that would manifest as Nazism. His passion was thepower of the will. The potential of willpower to achieve anything it desires wasto be his focus and guide throughout the years that followed. Put another way,creating your own reality.He practised the esoteric arts in his effort to access the level ofconsciousness he was convinced would turn him into one of the supermen he hadread so much about and believed in so much. His psyche became locked into thePrison Warder vibration more powerfully than before. He was possessed, probablyduring some black esoteric ritual which opened his psyche to the malevolentvibration. You only have to look at his beliefs to see that he would have had‘vibrational compatibility’ with this consciousness. It was now that anuncharismatic and ineffectual man would begin to exude the charisma andmagnetism that would captivate and intoxicate a nation.We talk of some people having magnetism and ‘magnetic personalities’, and thatis exactly what they have. We are all generating magnetic energies and theseattract to us the energies (people, places, etc) that relate to what is going onin our subconscious. Some people transmit powerful magnetism and others less so.Negative energies are just as magnetic as positive. Those connected to, andtherefore generating, the extreme Prison Warder vibration will be very magnetic.You often hear highly negative people described as having a magnetic personalityor a ‘fatal attraction’. This is why. It is also where the magnetism andcharisma of Adolf Hitler suddenly came from. When he was standing on a publicplatform with that contorted face and crazed delivery, he was channelling thePrison Warder/Luciferic Consciousness from the Fourth Dimension and transmittingthis vibration to the vast crowds. This affected the vibrational state of thepeople attracted by it and turned them into equally crazed agents of hatred. Itis the Pied Piper principle, using a vibration instead of a pipe. As the writerAlan Bullock said of Hitler:> “His power to bewitch an audience has been likened to the occult arts of the> African Medicine-man or the Asiatic Shaman; others have compared it to the> sensitivity of a medium, and the magnetism of a hypnotist.” 7> > And Herman Rauschning, an aide to Hitler, said in his book, Hitler Speaks:> “One cannot help thinking of him as a medium. For most of the time, mediums> are ordinary, insignificant people. Suddenly they are endowed with what seem> to be supernatural powers which set them apart from the rest of humanity. The> medium is possessed. Once the crisis is past, they fall back again into> mediocrity. It was in this way, beyond any doubt, that Hitler was possessed by> forces outside of himself – almost demoniacal forces of which the individual> named Hitler was only the temporary vehicle. The mixture of the banal and the> supernatural created that insupportable duality of which one was conscious in> his presence…It was like looking at a bizarre face whose expression seems to> reflect an unbalanced state of mind coupled with a disquieting impression of> hidden power.” 8Hitler was under the control of the Prison Warders and he appeared to live inperpetual fear of these ‘supermen’. Rauschning told how Hitler suffered fromterrible nightmares and would wake in terror screaming about entities who wereinvisible to all, but him. He once said to his aide:> “What will the social order of the future be like? Comrade, I will tell you.> There will be a class of overlords, after them the rank and file of the party> members in hierarchical order, and then the great mass of anonymous followers,> servants and workers in perpetuity, and beneath them again all the conquered> foreign races, the modern slaves. And over and above all these will reign a> new and exalted nobility of whom I cannot speak…But of all these plans the> militant members will know nothing…The new man is living amongst us now! He is> here. Isn’t that enough for you? I will tell you a secret. I have seen the new> man. He is intrepid and cruel. I was afraid of him.” 9After Hitler moved to Germany, he spent a lot of time in Bavaria, from whereWeishaupt’s Illuminati had sprung, and he returned there in 1918 after fightingin the war. Or at least that’s the official line. The following year, he cameacross a tiny and rather pathetic political party called the German WorkersParty. This was an offshoot of an esoteric secret society called the GermanOrder, which was fiercely nationalistic and anti-Jewish. Out of this Order cameother similar societies, including the infamous Thule Society. Thule wassupposed to be an ancient lost civilisation of Nordic people with blond hair andblue eyes. Yet another foundation of the Nazi belief system can be seen to havean esoteric origin, as did the swastika, the Hitler salute, the idea of an AryanMaster Race, and the view of Jews.A founder of the Thule Society was Rudolf Glauer, an astrologer, who changed hisname to the grand sounding Baron von Sebottendorff. His demands for a revolutionagainst Jews and the Marxists turned the Thule Society into a focus for theanti-Jew, anti-Marxist, German Master Racers. Out of all this came the GermanWorkers Party, which would one day become the Nazi Party.Another committed occultist and friend of Sebottendorff now becomes highlysignificant. This was Dietrich Eckart, a heavy-drinking, drug-taking writer whobelieved he was here to prepare the way for a dictator of Germany. He met Hitlerin 1919 and decided he was the one, the ‘Messiah’, he was looking for. It isEckart who is credited with Hitler’s advanced esoteric knowledge and probablythe black magic ritual, or rituals, which plugged him so completely into thePrison Warder vibration. From now on, Hitler’s power to attract support grewrapidly. Eckart wrote to a friend in 1923:> “Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have> given him the means of communication with Them. Do not mourn for me: I shall> have influenced history more than any other German.” 10Hitler was also a member of another esoteric secret society, the Luminous Lodgeor Vril Society. Vril was the name given by the English writer, Lord BulwerLytton, to the force which, he claimed, awakens people to their true power andpotential to become supermen. In 1933, the rocket expert, Willi Ley, fled fromGermany and revealed the existence of the Vril Society and the Nazis’ beliefthat they would become the equals of the supermen in the bowels of the Earth byuse of esoteric teachings and mind expansion. They believed this would reawakenthe vril force sleeping in the blood. The initiates of the Vril Society includedtwo men who would become infamous Nazis, Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Goering.Vril members were convinced they were in alliance with mysterious esotericlodges in Tibet and one of the so called Unknown Supermen, who was referred toas The King of Fear. Rudolph Hess,11 Hitler’s Deputy Führer until he made hisill-fated flight to England in 1941, was a dedicated occultist and a member,with Hermann Goering, of the Edelweiss Society, a black sect which believed inthe Nordic Master Race (Melchedekans?). Hess worshipped Hitler as The Messiah,although how he could do this when the Führer was hardly blue eyed and blondhaired, is not clear. Hitler had the same problem in equating the two, but hewould have found some ridiculous explanation for it, I’m sure.Another Hitler obsession was the so called Spear of Destiny, the weapon allegedto have been use to pierce the side of Y’shua (Jesus) at the crucifixion. Hestole what was claimed to be the spear when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938,and it was taken to Nuremberg. The legend says that whoever has the spear anddecodes its secrets will have control of the world for good or evil. The onethat Hitler stole is now in the Hofburg Museum in Vienna, where there was amajor fire in November 1992, seven days before the blaze which destroyed part ofWindsor Castle.Another obsessive occultist in the Third Reich was Heinrich Himmler. He was intoall matters esoteric and he used his knowledge in the blackest of ways. He wasparticularly interested in the rune stones, a system of divination in whichstones carrying symbols are thrown or selected and the choice or combination‘read’ by an ‘expert’. It was Himmler who formed the notorious SS and, as withthe swastika, he chose an esoteric symbol for his horrific organisation: thedouble S or ‘sig’ rune, which looks like two flashes of lightning. The SS was avirtually self-contained body and the epitome of all of the esoteric knowledgein which the Nazis believed so passionately. Only those considered racially purewere allowed to join, and instruction in the esoteric arts, including the runestones, was fundamental to their training. The SS was run and governed as ablack magic secret society. Their rituals were taken from others such as TheJesuits and The Knights Templar. The highest ranking initiates were the thirteenmembers of the Grand Council of Knights (led by their Grand Master, HeinrichHimmler), and the black rituals were performed at the ancient castle ofWewelsberg in Westphalia. They celebrated the festivals of the Nordic pagans andthe summer solstice. Here they worshiped Satan, Lucifer, Set, whichever name youprefer, the consciousness which was the Nazis and is the Elite today. PrinceBernhard, one of the founders of the Bilderberg Group, was in the SS.Esoteric knowledge and black magic pervaded all that Hitler and the Nazis did,even down to the use of pendulums on maps to identify the positions of enemytroops. The original swastika symbol was right-handed which, in esoteric terms,means light and creation, the positive. Hitler insisted it be turned around tosymbolise black magic and destruction. The mass rallies that Hitler used soeffectively were designed with the knowledge of the human psyche and how it canbe manipulated. In Satan And Swastika, Francis King says:> “Hitler’s public appearances, particularly those associated with the Nazi> Party’s Nuremberg Rallies, were excellent examples of this sort of magical> ceremony. The fanfares, military marches and Wagnerian music all emphasised> the idea of German military glory. The massed Swastika banners in black, white> and red filled the consciousness of the participants in the Rally with> National Socialist ideology. The ballet-like precision of the movements of the> uniformed Party members, all acting in unison, evoked from the unconscious the> principles of war and violence which the ancients symbolised as Mars. And the> prime ritual of the Rallies – Hitler clasping to other banners the “blood> banner” carried in the Munich putsch of 1923 – was a quasi-magical ceremony> designed to link up minds of living Nazis with the archetypal images> symbolised by the dead National Socialist heroes of the past.> “The religio-magical aspects of the Rallies were emphasised by the fact that> their high points were reached after dusk and took place in a ‘Cathedral of> Light’ – an open space surrounded by pillars of light coming from electric> searchlights pointed upwards to the sky. If a modern ritual magician of the> utmost expertise had designed a ritual intended to ‘invoke Mars’ he could not> have come up with anything more effective than the ceremonies used at> Nuremberg.”And what applied then, applies now. The esoteric knowledge used by the Nazis forthe mass hypnosis on the German people, is being used today to expand the globalhypnosis on the human race. Symbols, words, colours, sounds, and techniques ofwhich the public are not even aware are being used in the media and advertisingto hypnotise us. The Propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goebbels was based on theesoteric knowledge of the human psyche. He knew that people will believeanything if you tell them often enough and if you can engineer events whichcreate the “something must be done” mentality in the public mind. He usedcolours, symbols, and slogans to great effect. The slogans were used likemantras and repeated over and over again, hypnotising the mass psyche. Allalternative views and information were censored and the people were programmedto respond as desired. What is the difference between that and the constantdrip, drip, drip, of inaccurate and biased information that is fed to us and ourchildren today? It may not have a swastika on it, but it is still masshypnotism.It would seem to be a contradiction that Hitler sought to destroy secretsocieties like the Freemasons and to prevent the use of esoteric knowledge inGerman society, but it isn’t. He knew as much as anyone the power available tothose with the understanding, and he wanted to keep that for himself. One manthe Nazis wanted to destroy was the 33rd degree Freemason Dr Rudolf Steiner, anAustrian who understood the powers of creation and the way they can be used forgood and evil. I have come across many conflicting views and claims aboutSteiner’s intent and I’ve not yet developed an opinion. I feel, however, that hewas not as positive as he’s made out. He joined the Theosophical Society and theOrder of the Oriental Temple, but later formed his own Anthroposophical Society.Armed gangs began to break up Steiner’s meetings and threatened the lives ofthose who listened to him. He fled to Switzerland and died in 1925, a year afterhis centre at Dornach was burned down by the Nazis. In 1934, all forms offortune telling were banned in Berlin and later esoteric books were bannedthroughout Germany. Secret societies were disbanded and even the Thule Societyand the German Order (which had together founded Nazism) were targeted.Astrologers were attacked and killed and people like Lanz von Liebenfels wereprevented from publishing their work. This purge had two main motives. Todistance Hitler and the Nazis from the occult in the minds of the public andother countries, and, most importantly, to pull up the ladder and stop anyoneelse from using esoteric knowledge against them as they were using it againstothers. This is one reason, too, why this knowledge has been suppressed andridiculed throughout the Western world and hidden behind the smokescreens ofthis-world-is-all-there-is science, and one-life-and-then-heaven-or-hellreligion.The role of the esoteric in the rise of the Nazis has been thoroughlyunderplayed or ignored except in a few excellent books such as Gerald Suster’sHitler And The Age Of Horus.12 Look deeper into any historical situation and youwill usually find the esoteric. John Ruskin, the man who inspired Cecil Rhodes,Alfred Milner, and those who formed the Round Table secret society, was himselfinfluenced by the esoteric writings of Plato and by Madame Blavatsky, the booksof Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and secret societies in the mould of the Order ofthe Golden Dawn. The murder of US President Abraham Lincoln has been explainedby some as part of the struggle between competing secret societies, although Idon’t accept that. One of his close friends, Pascal Beverly Randolph, revealedthat Lincoln was involved with a society called the Brotherhood of Eulis afterbeing initiated into the secrets of “sexual magic” in the Middle East. Lincolnwas also believed to be a high ranking member of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor or of the Light.13 Many of the famous political and economic faces ofhistory and today are masks which hide their true nature and motivation. Theyare the apparently ‘different’ faces of the All-Seeing Eye network. We arewatching actors on a stage and someone else is writing their script. Rasputin,the so called mad monk of the history books, was neither mad nor a monk in theconventional sense. He was a mystic who went through a massive spiritualexperience while “searching for god” in Asia. His psyche was opened to somehigher – or lower – consciousness and this Russian peasant was suddenly adifferent person. He was capable of healing and had an intense magnetism andlegendary sexual drive. A few years after returning to Russia, he had such ahold over the Tsar that he was, in effect, the ruler of the country.Stories have come to light of the black esoteric basis of the KGB in the formerSoviet Union. Today the KGB under other titles plays exactly the same role in‘free’ Russia. Only its name has changed. One report highlights the manipulationwithin the Kremlin by General Georgy Georgievich Rogozin who, it is said, usesblack magic to program the psyche of those he wishes to control.14 He heads ahighly secretive intelligence group in Boris Yeltsin’s presidential team. Theglobal intelligence network is founded on the misuse of esoteric knowledge. TheGlobal Elite and those who abuse the esoteric knowledge also know that if youcan control the key energy power points (acupuncture points and chakra vortexes)on the Earth’s energy grid, you can massively affect the psyche of the people,as the human minds interact with the grid energies, the Earth mind.We have seen how the United States of America was founded on esoteric principlesand knowledge. The Great Seal of the United States is a mass of esotericsymbols, signs, and numbers, including the pyramid and all-seeing eye. Thissymbol was put on the dollar note during the presidency of Freemason Franklin D.Roosevelt. It is also no coincidence that the Declaration of Independence andthe founding of Adam Weishaupt’s Bavarian Illuminati both happened in 1776.Numbers and years represent energy vibrations, as do planets, sounds, colours,and symbols. We see some of these symbols in the crop circles and patterns. Thegenuine ones (those not hoaxed by the forces of disinformation), speak to oursubconscious and help to awaken us in ways we cannot yet fully understand. Atthe higher levels of the Global Elite, this esoteric knowledge is used to decidewhen and where events will happen to give them the best chance of success.You will find the same numbers and sequences throughout ancient texts andbeliefs. The lists of sevens in Revelation have esoteric, not literal, meanings.The Bible is packed with such numerology, which the church has taken literally.Thirteen, or the ‘twelve and one’, has great esoteric significance under thelaws of numerology and the vibrations they represent, and for other historicalreasons, too. It means transformation, new birth, a new order. Hence you findJesus and twelve disciples and the Grand Master Himmler and twelve other‘knights’ in the Grand Council of the SS. It is the same knowledge, used withdifferent intent. Osiris, the god of Egypt, had twelve followers according tolegend, Buddha had twelve disciples, as did the Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl. Thereare the twelve knights of King Arthur’s Round Table, twelve sons of Jacob,twelve princes of Ishmael, twelve tribes of Israel, twelve signs of the zodiac.The Bilderberg Group Steering Committee has 39 members (13 + 13 + 13) and itchooses its locations on esoteric principles.15 It is the same with the globalinstitutions. Geneva, the home of the League of Nations and many other GlobalElite fronts, is regarded by the secret societies as one of the planet’s mostimportant earth energy centres. You will find the numbers 13 and 33 in thesymbols and logos of many institutions and companies named in this book. FrancisBacon’s esoteric “code” number was 33 and it is used as code in the Shakespeareplays to indicate that Bacon was the real author (see the works of Manly P.Hall). The 33 represents the degrees in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. On theGreat Seal of the United States and its depiction on the dollar note, you find13 steps on the pyramid, the 13 degrees of the Illuminati. The pyramid has 33stones. On the Great Seal the bald eagle (the phoenix until 1841) has 13feathers on each wing, 13 arrows in the right talon and an olive branch with 13leaves in the left. In his beak he has a scroll with the 13 letters of “EPluribus Unum” – out of many, one. Around this are 13 stars in the shape of theStar of David. There is also a shield with 13 stripes which represent theoriginal 13 states. On the United Nations logo, the map of the world is arrangedin 33 segments within 13 ears of corn, and the UN building is sited over one ofthe most sacred springs (energy points) to the Native Americans. The Proctor andGamble logo is an old masonic symbol with a bearded man in a circle alongside 13stars. The combined Xs in the Rockefeller oil giant, Exxon (Esso), is anothersymbol of the Scottish Rite.16 The symbolism is everywhere. The ‘thinking’ andthe basic beliefs I have outlined from Nazi Germany are only a publicmanifestation of what is still going on in the secret world of the Elite todayas they worship the All-Seeing Eye – the Luciferic Consciousness of the FourthDimension.After the war, the Nazis moved their base to South America and the UnitedStates, at the invitation of the Nazi funder, Allen Dulles, and they helped himto form the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. This is a key part of today’sglobal gestapo and the same black use of esoteric knowledge and the worship ofthe extraterrestrial ‘gods’ and ‘supermen’ remains at the core of the CIA andthe Global Elite to this day. What was true of Hitler is true of the upperreaches of the Brotherhood network, even down to the appalling geneticexperiments which have continued in the underground bases in the United States,(and other countries, too, no doubt, including the UK). We have this farce of a‘public debate’ about the morality of genetic engineering while the mosthorrendous experimentation goes on in secret, I believe, using people (includingchildren) who go ‘missing’. After the first edition of this book, acorrespondent wrote to tell of an Argentine friend who said that Josef Mengele,the notorious Nazi geneticist, was set up with his own island after the war sothat he could continue his sickening experimentation. The island is in a riverdelta in an area called Tigre, about 50 kilometres from Buenos Aires. Black useof esoteric knowledge under the guidance of the Prison Warder consciousness isat the peak of the Elite’s human pyramid of global manipulation. I feel thatpeople like Hitler were merely stooges, used to create conflict with otherstooges like Stalin, and so bring about the desired post-war outcome. The SuperElite are well above the levels of people like Hitler and Stalin in the pyramid.Given the background to the Nazi beliefs in the esoteric, the “Aryan supermen”and its possible connection with the stories of the Melchedekans, I wasinterested to come across an organisation called the Raëlian Foundation. It isbased in Geneva, Switzerland, with branches around the world. This is thecreation of a former French motor racing journalist called Claude Vorilhon Raël(rail) who claims to have met an extraterrestrial group which he says are theElohim of the Old Testament. Raël says he was taken to their planet and he wastold that the Elohim genetically engineered the human race. According to thestories told in the secret 1960s survey of contactees, the ones known as Elohimwere the Melchedekans. Raël claims to be the “messiah” of the Elohim, the “Guideof Guides”, and they instructed him, he says, to tell people that they must doeverything he says. Oh really, Raël? My reply to the Elohim and to Claude wouldbe unsuitable for a family audience. Raël (the messiah, Guide of Guides), saysthe Elohim are preparing to return to take over the world. Fascinating how closethat is to the Nazi belief in the return of the supermen. And what was it thatRaël says that the Elohim desire? A world government and currency; for thearmies to stop fighting each other and come together as a world police force;and for only those scientifically assessed as the intellectually brightest to beallowed to run for political office. What’s more, only those who pass anintellect test devised by scientists should be allowed to vote and the massesshould simply do as they are told with no rights to decide who governs them.[../Images/00005.jpg]Figure 12a: Temporary stickerThe new sticker on the front of Raël’s book[../Images/00007.jpg]Figure 12b: Swastika within the Star of DavidWhen the sticker was peeled off, this is the symbol that it was hidingI had never heard of Raël or his followers until I was told by a source close tothe British intelligence network that some of those behind the campaign todiscredit me as a “neo-Nazi” after the first edition of this book were connectedwith the Raël Foundation in the UK. That same day someone else gave me a book byClaude Raël called The Message Given To Me By Extra-Terrestrials. They Took MeTo Their Planet.17 The Raël Foundation appeared to be suddenly very shy aboutthe symbol on the front of the book which Raël said was the symbol of theElohim. A sticker with another symbol had been used to cover up the original oneon the cover. You will perhaps appreciate why when you look at Figure 12. Theesoteric knowledge and the themes of extraterrestrial master races pervade theElite pyramid and have done for thousands of years right into the modern world.But I cannot stress too powerfully that esoteric knowledge is neutral. It is notthe knowledge we need to challenge, but its negative use. It can, and is, usedto very positive effect. When I hear Christian investigators of the New WorldOrder condemning all esoteric thinkers and groups as the ‘evil occult’ and‘Devil worshippers’, it reveals a serious misunderstanding of reality, in myview, and a bigotry that ill becomes them. As I shall discuss in more detailtowards the end of the book, the positive use of spiritual knowledge is crucialto building the better world we seek and which we are making a reality, have nofear. It is built on the foundations of love and respect, the emotions – theenergies – which are sweeping away the blackness of hatred and misunderstanding.In these last three chapters I have outlined the structure within which themanipulation is coordinated, the means through which the dark force controls it,and the mindset that motivates its behaviour.

This is not taught in the schools and nosmart-suited economist or correspondent on the television news will tell you thetruth, either. Some of them don’t know what is going on because they have beenprogrammed to believe nonsense by the education system, while others simplydon’t want you to know. The foundations of the manipulation toward a worldgovernment, army, bank and currency are built on the fantastic con trick we callthe banking system. Once people understand the way this works, it is easy to seehow a few can control the lives of everyone else. It is worth repeating andexpanding here on what I said in Chapter 3[../Text/index_split_012.html#filepos162624].The banks are given the power to ‘create’ money, by which they mean ‘creating’non-existent money known as credit. This costs them nothing, but the moment thiscredit is brought into theoretical existence the banks can start to chargeinterest on it. This is the system that controls everyone’s life. But it goesfurther than that. When you take out a loan, the bank ‘creates’ credit for thesize of the loan, say £20,000. If only in theory, that is ‘new’ money. But youare not going to pay back only £20,000, because you have to pay interest on thatloan. The interest has not been ‘created’ by the bank, but it still has to befound from somewhere. So where? From the wealth and credit already circulatingin the world.In this way, since this crazy banking system began, the real wealth of theplanet has been sucked into the banking system as the interest paid on everyloan to every person, business, and government. This has allowed them to lendeven more non-existent money on the back of that and get the world even deeperin debt. The wealth and credit-loaning capacity they have accumulated is beyondcomprehension, far more than that of the United States, the richest country inthe world. In fact, they own the United States, as they own almost every othercountry in the world. The bankers have used this wealth and credit mountain tobuy and control the global oil companies, multinationals of every kind, themedia, the armament companies, the drug companies, the politicians, thepolitical ‘advisors’, and virtually everything else they need to control theworld. The same few people and families own the lot! They hide this truth behindthe front organisations, the nexus of companies, and the puppet directors, andthey are supported in their desire for secrecy by the pathetic media and theeducation system. The Rockefellers and Rothschilds alone control a fantasticnetwork of banks, oil companies, multinational corporations, airlines, andscores of other organisations. The Rockefeller/Rothschild Chase Manhattan Bankhas enough power by itself to stimulate a global financial panic. In 1995 theChase merged with Chemical Bank which had already absorbed ManufacturersHanover. The concentration of power is incredible. But the true controllers ofthese empires are hidden from public view by frontmen, trusts, foundations, andcompanies. The Rockefellers’ ability to hide the extent of their power isphenomenal. But with the Rothschilds it borders on genius. Particularly sincethe second World War, they have sought to promote an image of a declining poweroperating outside of the big league. Nonsense. They are the big league alongwith other elements of the Global Elite.According to the New World Order researcher, Eustace Mullins,1 the Rothschildsuse the code ‘City’ and ‘First City’ in North America to indicate banks undertheir influence from the City of London. He says these include First CityProperties, First City Financial Corporation of Vancouver, First City Trust ofEdmonton, and First City Development Ltd, which are all headed by SamuelBelzberg. Much of the coordination is communicated through Rothschild Inc., ofRockefeller Plaza, New York, according to Mullins. The Rothschilds also operatethrough a Canadian company known as PowerCorp which in turn connects with theHollinger Group, the Canadian publishing empire owned by the elite Bilderberger,Conrad Black. The Hollinger Group controls a stream of publications worldwide,including the London-based Telegraph newspapers, and its international advisorsare Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington, chairman of the Bilderberg Group,former British cabinet minister, and a cousin of the Rothschild family. (Thesetwo formed their own company, Kissinger Associates.) This covert interlinking ofpower in banking, politics, and the media allows the same few individuals topromote the same policy through a host of apparently unconnected institutionsand organisations.By controlling the creation of credit, the bankers can cause booms and busts,nationally and internationally, whenever they wish to further their ambitions.An economic depression is not caused by a collapse in the demand for goods andservices. People do not decide that they no longer want jobs done or articlesproduced. An economic depression is caused when there are not enough pieces ofpaper and electronic ‘money’ in circulation to pay for those goods and services.And who controls the amount of money-credit in circulation? The banks. If theywant to cause a depression for ulterior motives, as in pre-war Germany and theUS, they take measures which reduce the amount of money in circulation. Theyreduce the number of loans they make and raise interest rates.This also reaps a colossal reward for the major (Global Elite) banks. Peoplestill have to pay the interest on loans taken out before the manufacturedeconomic collapse and if they default, the banks take their property andincrease by hundreds of thousands the number of farms, businesses, and homesthey own. And with every payment of interest by those who continue to pay theirloans during a depression, more money is being taken out of circulation and notrecycled back into the economy, thus increasing the depression.This process of reducing the money in circulation and causing a depression canbe seen all the time. The economists and their poodles, the politicians andeconomic correspondents, call all this part of the ‘economic cycle’. Baloney. Inthe 1930s that terrible depression, in which men, women, and children starved ina world of plenty, was caused by the banks withdrawing money from circulation byrefusing loans. It wasn’t that people didn’t want to eat; they simply could notafford to buy the food because money had been artificially taken out ofcirculation. I will leave it to an ‘insider’ to sum up the situation I havedescribed. Robert H. Hemphill, a credit manager at the Federal Reserve Bank inAtlanta, said:> “This is a staggering thought. We are completely dependent on the commercial> banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash or> credit. If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous, if not,> we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a> complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position> is almost incredible, but there it is. It is the most important subject> intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon. It is so important that> our present civilisation may collapse, unless it becomes widely understood and> the defects remedied very soon.” 2There was no money, people were told, to build houses and feed the population.But suddenly, when it was time for the Global Elite’s war, the money availableto finance Hitler, Japan, and the war effort in the United States and GreatBritain was limitless. People often say that there always seems to be moneyavailable to fight wars. Of course there is, because the bankers who control theworld economic system want those wars. They do not want people well-housed withfull bellies and a proper education because then they would be much harder tocontrol. It was not the much-hyped ‘New Deal’ policies of Franklin Rooseveltwhich ended the 30s depression, it was the banks putting money back intocirculation to finance the war they were creating. Here is a reality of life onEarth:There is no need for anyone to be cold, hungry, homeless or in poverty. Allthese things are caused by the lack of pieces of paper and electronic numberscalled money circulating in the world and by the charging of interest on them.We could change that today if the desire was there.The world financial system and policies of boom and bust are controlled by justthirteen people – the members of the International Banking Commission in Geneva,Switzerland, which was set up by David Rockefeller on behalf of the Elite in1972. The Commission is made up of two members each from the US Federal Reserve,the Bank of England, the central banks of Germany, France and Switzerland, andone member each from the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia. It has its ownintelligence agency known as Four-I, the International Intelligence InformationInstitute. This banking Elite is controlled by families like the Rothschilds,Rockefellers (Rockenfelders), Bilts and Goldbergs. Connecting with theCommission is the Bank of International Settlements, also in Switzerland, thecountry at the centre of the Elite financial network. The BIS helps tocoordinate the policies of the national central banks, like the United StatesFederal Reserve, the private banking cartel which decides the economic andinterest rate policies of the United States, no matter what the puppetpresidents and politicians think about it (Figure 13). The ‘Fed’ does not haveboard membership of the BIS, but it is the coordination that goes onunofficially that matters. The Federal Reserve sends representatives to all itsmeetings and subscribes to the shares of the BIS.3 Most people in America don’teven realise the Federal Reserve is a private organisation. They think (a) thegovernment would not be stupid or corrupt enough to allow a private bankingcartel to run the country (wrong!) or (b) that the word ‘Federal’ means that itmust be part of the government (equally wrong).[../Images/00018.jpg]Figure 13The term Federal is used for many Elite organisations in the US to give theillusion of government ownership. In the United Kingdom, we are sold theillusion that the Bank of England is nationalised and therefore under thecontrol of the government. The Bank of England is one of the focal points of theElite financial network. It was controlled by the Rothschild Empire when it wasan officially private bank, and it has continued to be controlled by the GlobalElite since it was nationalised by the post-war Labour Government and it becamean unofficial private bank.The first move by the new Labour Party Chancellor Gordon Brown (Bil) aftertaking office in May 1997, was to allow the Bank of England to set interestrates like the Federal Reserve, a move he had hinted at two years earlier.4Within days of taking office he did precisely that. Eddie George, the Bank ofEngland Governor, is a former executive of both the Elite-controlled Bank ofInternational Settlements and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The whole house of cards, and the control of the human race, is based on thecharging of interest on money. The subject of interest is crucial. There isnothing wrong with money if it is used only as a measure of exchange for goodsand services. It is when you can charge interest on money, most of which doesn’tphysically exist, that enormous dangers arise. You can then make more money frommanipulating pieces of paper and electronic numbers than you can from producingessential goods and services for people who need them. With the charging ofinterest, the money chases those who already have money and ignores those whohave not. The cataclysmic social and financial divisions in the world are causedby the charging of interest on money. Production is geared to greed, not need,and the rich get richer and the poor, poorer. Often it is not the cost of ahouse that prevents people from buying a home, it is because we have to buythree or four for the right to live in one!A mortgage leaflet put out by the National Westminster Bank tells me that if Itake out a loan of £50,000, I will actually pay them back £152,000, the price ofthree houses to buy one. And on the front of the leaflet they have the nerve toclaim: “The National Westminster Bank. We’re here to make life easier”. Imaginethe transformation that would occur if people only had to repay the capital(with no interest) on their house over a period of 25 to 30 years. The cost of amortgage and a basic human right (a home) would plummet immediately bytwo-thirds. The builders would still get paid because they are paid from thecapital price. The suppliers of the materials would still get paid for the samereason. The only person who would not make the killing of today would be thebanker who currently makes a fortune from every house purchase. Builders go outof business and people sleep in the streets to allow a few bankers to growfatter and richer, and ever more powerful.There is no reason whatsoever why a government cannot print its moneyinterest-free and lend it interest-free to the people to buy a home, withperhaps a small one-time charge to cover administration costs. The only thingstopping this is the lack of will to do so by politicians of all partiescontrolled directly by the Elite or by its economic manipulation. Look at howtaxation could be reduced dramatically, or even removed, if our governments –the people, in other words – were not paying back phenomenal sums in interest onmoney ‘borrowed’ from the banks. A friend in the financial business reckons thatfor every pound or dollar that exists as cash, another 30 million exists (orrather doesn’t!) as electronic “credit”. Pastor Sheldon Emery described thissystem of government debt-creation very well in his book, Billions For TheBankers, Debts For The People:> “The Federal Government, having spent more than it has taken from its citizens> in taxes, needs, for the sake of illustration, $1 billion. Since it does not> have the money, Congress has given away its authority to ‘create’ it, the> Government must go to the ‘creators’ for the $1 billion. But the Federal> Reserve, a private corporation, doesn’t just give it away! The bankers are> willing to deliver $1 billion in money or credit to the Federal Government in> exchange for the Government’s agreement to pay it back – with interest! So> Congress authorises the Treasury Department to print $1 billion in US Bonds,> which are then delivered to the Federal Reserve Bankers. The Federal Reserve> then pays the cost of printing the $1 billion (about $1,000) and makes the> exchange. The Government then uses the money to pay its obligations. What are> the results of this fantastic transaction? Well, $1 billion in Government> bills are paid all right, but the Government has now indebted the people to> the bankers for $1 billion on which the people must pay interest! Tens of> thousands of such transactions have taken place since 1913 [when the Federal> Reserve was created] so that by the 1980s, the US Government is indebted to> the bankers for over $1 trillion on which the people pay over $100 billion a> year in interest alone with no hope of ever paying off the principal. [It is> far more today]. Supposedly our children and following generations will pay> forever and forever!> “You say, “This is terrible!” Yes, it is, but we have shown only part of the> sordid story. Under this unholy system, those United States Bonds have now> become ‘assets’ of the banks in the Reserve System which they then use as> ‘reserves’ to ‘create’ more ‘credit’ to lend. Current ‘reserve’ requirements> allow them to use that $1 billion in bonds to ‘create’ as much as $15 billion> in new ‘credit’ to lend to States, Municipalities, to individuals and> businesses. Added to the original $1 billion, they could have $16 billion of> ‘created credit’ out in loans paying them interest with their only cost being> $1,000 for printing the original $1 billion! Since the US Congress has not> issued Constitutional money since 1863, in order for the people to have money> to carry on trade and commerce they are forced to borrow the ‘created credit’> of the Monopoly Bankers and pay them usury-interest!” 5The term ‘constitutional money’ is a reference to the United StatesConstitution, which says, “Congress shall have the power to coin money andregulate the value thereof.” Unfortunately, either by accident or design, itdoes not say that Congress shall always coin money and regulate the valuethereof, and that no-one else will ever do so. The consequences of this havebeen quite dreadful for America and the world: in 1910, the Federal debt wasonly $1 billion, or $12.40 per person. State and local debts were very small ornon-existent; by 1920, just seven years after the Federal Reserve was launched,the US Government debt was $24 billion, $228 for every citizen; in 1960, thenational debt was $284 billion or $1,575 per head; by 1981, the debt passed $1trillion and has gone on soaring ever since. If the whole of the United Stateswere handed to the bankers to pay back the debts, they would still be owedanother two, maybe three Americas!6 It was not without reason that ThomasJefferson, one of the founding fathers, said:> “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their> money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks, and the> corporations that will grow up around …[the banks]…, will deprive the people> of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent> their fathers conquered.” 7In the United Kingdom, the government was paying £1 billion a year in intereston borrowing after the end of the 1960s. By 1993 it had soared to £24.5 billion.The government has borrowed to pay interest on previous loans while the capitalhas remained unrepaid. Contrast that £24.5 billion in interest payments with the£33 billion spent on health that year and the £11 billion awarded to education.8Don’t complain about a lack of school books or crumbling buildings. The bankershave got to eat, you know.The creation of debt through interest charges also sets up the structure throughwhich the takeover of the world by the few becomes possible. The bankers canaccumulate and manipulate businesses by accepting, or refusing, loans. Oneregular takeover scenario is for the Elite bankers, in concert, to deny loans toa target business or multinational corporation. This depresses its value on thestock exchanges. At this point, with the price of the stock falling, the bankersbuy large blocks of shares at bargain prices. The bankers then have a suddenchange of heart and approve the loan, thus increasing the company’s share value.The banks either sell the shares and make a handsome profit or they retain theirincreased control in the boardroom. When the banks gain control, what do theydo? They ensure that the company borrows more and more from the banks until theyare so much in debt that the banks own everything.It is in this way that the same few people have come to own all the majorbusinesses, the media, and so on. Once they owned the media, of course, itbecame easy to keep the truth from the people and feed us the lies that arenecessary to mislead and confuse us. If you are a journalist or a bank employee,go and find a mirror and ask it some questions. Your children are going to facethe consequences of the New World Order like everyone else’s, unless you wakeup. Nothing would improve the lives of people quicker than an end to thecharging of interest on money and for governments to print their own money,interest free, or to make the banks pay interest to the government. PresidentAbraham Lincoln began to do this with his so called ‘greenbacks’. He wasmurdered soon afterwards by John Wilkes Booth, an alleged agent of the House ofRothschild, in 1865. President John F. Kennedy proposed to do it and some of hisinterest-free notes are still in circulation. He was murdered by the Elite inDallas, Texas, in 1963.Another money confidence trick is that of inflation. We are told that inflationis caused by too much money in circulation chasing too few goods. This is usedto justify the removal of money from circulation, which leads to an economic‘depression’. This was a ruse used by the Volcker-Reagan-Thatcher trio in theearly 1980s when the ‘in’ phrase was “squeezing inflation out of the system”.How can inflation be caused by too much money chasing too few goods when in anyboom or depression the shops are full of goods on the shelves left unsold? Andif more goods are being sold and production is increased, why don’t the socalled economies of scale bring prices down? Greed is part of this, for sure,but there are actually too many goods chasing too little money in circulation.Interest on money massively inflates prices and it does so while ensuring thatthere is too little money to spend on goods.Each time a bank creates a loan, it is creating more debt than the amount of theloan itself. Take the example of the £50,000 loan from the National WestminsterBank I mentioned earlier. The loan is worth £50,000, but the debt created at thesame time is £102,000. To pay this back, the borrower has to find more money –double, in this case – than he has borrowed. The only way he can do this is toearn money that someone else has borrowed into existence. The debt of people andgovernment explodes in this way, but there is still a scarcity of money to spendon goods because so much of the money in circulation is spent on servicing debt.We are told in these circumstances that the supply of money in circulation mustbe reduced because prices are being inflated by too much money in the system.The main reason prices go up is because they are reflecting the amount of debtthat has to be serviced. The more debt, the higher the prices throughout thesystem from material suppliers to transportation to advertising to shops. Thecumulative effect of all this debt is reflected in the price of a product on theshelf. Whenever you buy anything, from a loaf of bread to a Rolls Royce, you arepaying back someone else’s debt to the banks. How do the economic ‘experts’react to higher prices caused by the need to service debt? They raise interestrates to discourage more borrowing and reduce the amount of money incirculation. And what effect does that have? It creates more debt among thosepeople already servicing loans and ensures that there is even less money tospend on goods. Whichever situation you have, there is never too much moneychasing too few goods, except among certain products and commodities from timeto time due to a host of other factors, including greed. Generally it is alwaysthe other way round, too little money for too many goods. The only difference inthis situation during a boom or bust is that of degree. The end of charginginterest on money will lower prices and transform the lives of everyone on theplanet. So what are we waiting for?The Gold MountainOne point to emphasise is the extent of the wealth accumulated by the Elitethrough the debt-interest system, and by stealing the world’s gold. A contactwho has studied and worked within the global financial system, says that goldstolen by the Elite, from Russia after the war and from Japan, the USA and othersources, totals some $60 trillion. This, he says, is held at the Cloutenprecious metals depository near Zurich, and similar depositories at Umbrea nearGeneva, in Vienna and at the Rhein – the main airbase in Frankfurt. During thewar, the Elite gold was stored at the US military base at Melinom near Jakata,Indonesia, where it was guarded by 20,000 troops. My contact has paperwork toprove many of these claims.The Money PoliceAfter the Second World War, with the nations of Europe devastated by conflictand debt to the Elite’s bankers, the next stage in the global domination ofmoney and credit was installed through groupings like the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). TheWorld Bank, IMF, and GATT were all agreed upon by British and Americannegotiators at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944. Mostinfluential in these agreements were the economist, Lord Keynes, from Britain,and the US Treasury Secretary, Harry Dexter White (CFR), who, with Alger Hiss,the secretary general at the launch of the United Nations, would later beexposed as communist spies. The technical secretary at Bretton Woods wasVirginius Frank Coe, an official of the US Treasury. He was appointed secretaryof the new IMF until it was revealed in 1952 during congressional testimony thathe was also a member of Dexter White’s communist ring! These were the guys whocreated the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.The role of the World Bank (not to be confused with a world central bank) is tomake loans to governments for large capital projects. These have been used, asintended, to finance projects in poor countries designed to meet the needs ofthe multinationals. These include policies forcing people from the land, thusdestroying self-sufficient lifestyles and creating dependency on the Elite’sglobal economy. Much of the destruction of the rainforests has been done withloans from the World Bank, which, as we have seen, is always headed byappointees from the CFR, TC, Bil, establishment, and has eugenics as a keypillar of its policy. This subsidised environmental destruction has another plusfor the Elite. It helps them to justify world control by the need to ‘save theplanet’.A role of the World Bank and other global economic ‘agencies’ is to make afortune for the multinational construction companies like the Bechtel Group.This is normally done by making loans to Third World countries for megaconstruction projects which are irrelevant, even disastrous, for the needs ofthe local people. In April 1995, President Bill Clinton successfully nominatedJames Wolfensohn9 to be the new president of the World Bank. Wolfensohn, anAustralian-born, naturalised American, has the perfect background for the post.In the 1960s, he worked for the J. Henry Schroder Bank in London and went on toserve on the Rockefellers’ ‘population control’ organisation, the PopulationCouncil. Other Global Elite groups he has served include the RockefellerFoundation, the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, and the BrookingsInstitute. Add to that his position on the steering committee of the BilderbergGroup and his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations and TrilateralCommission, and you have the perfect man to head the Global Elite’s World Bank.I’m sure none of this influenced Bill Clinton’s ‘decision’ to nominate him! In1992, Wolfensohn joined forces with Lord Rothschild to form J. Rothschild,Wolfensohn, a business advice consultancy. As chairman, they appointed PaulVolcker,10 the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and leading memberof the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, and BilderbergGroup. Volcker was the man who launched the devastating economic policies in theUnited States and the UK in the 1980s which were fronted by Ronald Reagan andMargaret Thatcher.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is there to intervene when poor countriesin Africa, Asia, and the rest of the developing world get into Elite-engineeredfinancial trouble. The idea has been to encourage and bribe the politicians inthese countries into relinquishing self-sufficiency in food and into opening uptheir lands to the multinational food and chocolate giants. These countriesbegan to export luxury cash crops to the rich nations and to use that money topay for imported food from those same rich countries. Also, the developingnations would export natural resources to the rich nations at knock-down pricesand then buy back (at inflated prices) the luxury products the industrialisedcountries made with those natural resources. However, these luxury goods only goto the tiny, corrupt, political and economic clique in these developingcountries. The majority of the population go hungry because the food-growingland is occupied by the multinational corporations. The Elite’s policy was tosubmerge the poor countries in debt and take them over in the same way they hadwith the multinationals and the industrialised nations. When these governmentsfind themselves in financial trouble and unable to meet their debt repayments,in goes the IMF to ‘restructure’ the repayments or offer more loans to pay theinterest on the previous ones. But, in return for imposing more debt, the IMFinsists that its (Elite) economic policies are followed. These involve cuttingfood, health, and education subsidies, and the exporting of more resources andcash crops. The IMF tells all the developing countries to do this and thuscreates a glut on the world market for these commodities and the pricecollapses. More is exported at the expense of food-growing land for the poor,but no more is earned. The winners are the rich nations who get their resourcesand commodities cheaper. As a result you have the sight of hundreds of thousandsof Brazilian children dying through hunger-related disease when Brazil is thesecond biggest exporter of food in the world. But what a wonderful form ofeugenics and culling of the non-white population! A third of the Brazilianpopulation lives below the poverty line and seven million abandoned childrenbeg, steal, and sniff glue on the streets. This, in a country that should beamong the most prosperous in the world, with no problem of feeding itself. Itsproblems are not natural. They are, like those throughout the Third World,manufactured for the benefit of the Elite. Don’t be kidded by all this stuffabout compassionate ‘overseas aid’.Every year vastly more wealth is transferred from poor countries to rich thangoes the other way. We are bleeding them to death. And the overseas aid that ismade available is not aimed at helping developing countries. It is used to bribecorrupt politicians, to build the infrastructure needed by the multinationals,or to subsidise industries in the rich countries, like Bechtel, who carry outthe work as part of the aid deal. Another reality of life on Earth:There is no need for starvation and horrific suffering in Africa, Asia and LatinAmerica. It is not the result of ‘natural disasters’, but of coldly calculateddesign.‘Free’ TradeThe GATT policy is there to create dependency on the world economic system byforcing countries to drop their barriers to trade. This concept of ‘free trade’was advocated in the last century by the Scottish economist, Adam Smith, and itwas designed, at least in part, to justify Britain’s refusal to stop the exportsof opium into China. Pressure for Adam Smith’s – Elite-supported – view led tothe repeal of the Corn Laws in May 1846, which removed protection for Britishagriculture from overseas imports. It was a disastrous policy, just as itsarchitects (such as the Elite-controlled Bank of England and the Baring BrothersMerchant Bank) intended it to be. ‘Free’ trade has come a long way since then.GATT is now coordinated by the Elite’s World Trade Organisation, based in itsstronghold of Switzerland. It makes sense for the coordination of Elite bankingand trade policies to be based in the same country, I suppose. Countries whichadd tariffs to imported goods to protect home producers are bad news for the NewWorld Order. Such countries are far less dependent on the global system becausethey produce for themselves what their population needs. Trade in this sense isbased on mutual benefit, not winner takes all.In the early years of the United States, the government’s main income was fromtariffs. If goods were going to be imported, all the people should benefit, itwas believed. GATT, the European Union, the North American Free Trade Area, andthe new Asian-Pacific free trade area (APEC), are designed to destroy thisprotection and create dependency on the global system which the Elite control.Over recent years the momentum has increased to destroy the diversity ofproduction in all countries and make them dependent on importing essentialgoods.The British Conservative Governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major playedtheir part to perfection in this. The suicidal ‘monetarism’ of theThatcher-Reagan years destroyed the diversity of home production while the waveof ‘privatisations’ in the UK and elsewhere has handed the power over essentialservices like water, electricity, and gas into Elite hands – often with biggovernment subsidies, to boot. The consequences of this can now be seen by allbut the most dedicated idiot. But the media promotes ‘free trade’ as a goodthing and ‘protectionism’ as bad. They have bought the line sold to them byeconomists, politicians, and university lecturers, and they sell it to everyoneelse – the public.I remember when the latest GATT agreement was being negotiated (the so calledUruguay Round), how the famous news presenters in Britain summoned their mostconcerned and ominous voices to announce to their nightly audience of millionsthat the negotiations had broken down. We should all be very worried, we wereled to believe, because if the new GATT was not agreed upon, an economicnightmare would ensue. In truth, a nightmare for the Global Elite, not for thepeople. The Director General of GATT, Peter D. Sutherland (Bil, TC, Comm 300),was wheeled out to tell the world how important it was that the governmentsreached agreement.Sutherland, a former member of the European Commission and chairman of theElite-controlled Allied Irish Banks, was well briefed with the BilderbergGroup’s views on the matter. He attended their meeting in Finland in June 1994,and again in Switzerland in 1995. Of course, in the end GATT was agreed andpassed through Congress and parliaments by governments and ‘oppositions’ alike,because the overwhelming majority of politicians of all parties are either toonaïve to see beyond the end of their noses (most of them) or they know what thegame plan is (the relative few). The World Trade Organisation has the power toimpose sanctions on countries which erect barriers to the flow of ‘free’ trade.The Elite must have gone into orgasm when this lot was agreed. What a tool tocontrol the world!‘Free’ trade is the freedom of the strong to exploit the weak. It is the meansthrough which multinationals, subsidised by their governments via the overseasaid budgets and other hidden channels, operate ‘cartelism’ against the interestsof the general population. It is the freedom to create dependency on a systemwhich only the few control, and to use that dependency to manipulate at will.The freedom to move production from high wage industrialised countries to thesweat shops of the Third World, savagely exploiting the native population. Thefreedom to steal their food growing land and to destroy the industries andincomes of those in the developed world, also. In doing this, the Elite createanger, despair, and division, the perfect combination for manipulation. That, myfriends, is the ‘free’ trade the economists, politicians, and newscorrespondents tell us we desperately need more of. The word in my head at thismoment does not bear repeating.The Seven Sisters Oil CartelWorking alongside the banks, and owned by the same people, are the oilcompanies. These are responsible for countless coups and conflicts and thegrotesque manipulation of sovereign countries. As late as 1882, oil had littlecommercial value. It was used in lamps and not much more. William “Doc”Rockefeller also peddled oil at $25 a pint as a cure for warts, snake bites,cancer, and impotency.11 In 1853 his son, John D. Rockefeller, formed theinfamous Standard Oil Company to supply the fuel for the growth in oil burninglamps and to exploit the much greater potential claimed for the substanceseeping through the rocks and fissures of the Earth. With the development of theinternal combustion engine, the value of oil was transformed. So were theeconomy and politics of the world. The British Admiral, Lord Fisher, was one ofthe first to see the military significance of oil and later, as First Sea Lord,he led the debate on how to secure supplies for the British Navy in a countrywhich, at that time, had no oil of its own. As usual, the answer was: If wedon’t have any, we’ll take someone else’s. An Australian engineer, geologist,and devout Christian called William Knox d’Arcy had found oil north of thePersian Gulf, in what is now Iran. He had bought the rights to exploit it fromthe Shah for $20,000 and agreed to pay a 16% royalty on sales. The contractgranted him and all his “heirs, assigns, and friends” exclusive rights toPersian oil until 1961. The British Secret Service, on behalf of the government,dispatched the ‘ace of spies’, Sidney Reilly, to dupe d’Arcy into handing overhis rights to the British. Reilly (real name, Sigmund Georgjevich Rosenblum fromOdessa, Russia) posed as a priest and persuaded d’Arcy to sign over hisexclusive rights to Persian oil to a ‘Christian’ organisation, the Anglo-PersianOil Company. In early 1913, at the urging of Winston Churchill, Fisher’ssuccessor as First Sea Lord, the Asquith government secretly bought acontrolling interest in Anglo-Persian Oil. We know this company better today asBritish Petroleum – BP. The wealth of this company is founded on the work of anagent of the British Secret Service, the notorious spy, Sidney Reilly, who liedto, and hoodwinked, a gullible man by manipulating his devout Christian beliefs.Given the behaviour of BP over the years, that is rather appropriate, really.For years, the competition between oil companies and countries seeking todominate world oil supplies, led to conflict throughout Europe and the MiddleEast. Britain was responsible for stimulating wars in the Balkans, Turkey, andBulgaria before 1914 to disrupt and sabotage the building of Germany’s ‘Berlinto Baghdad’ Railway, which threatened Britain’s grip on the Middle East. TheBritish used their control of Kuwait to prevent the completion of the railwayfrom Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. Using force and corrupt sheikhs, the BritishGovernment ruthlessly seized control of Arab countries and their oil supplies.It was to set the scene for the conflict we have witnessed in the Middle Eastever since, and the creation of the State of Israel was part of the divide andrule policy based on the control of oil. Can you understand why the Arabs todayget so angry at what they see – quite rightly – as Western imperialism? Theyhave had it up to here.The other oil company controlled by the British government was Royal DutchShell,12 outwardly run by the Dutch-born, Sir Henry Deterding (Comm 300), anaturalised Briton. In fact, it was controlled by a group of parties who votedon behalf of the British Government. The covert support and guidance of theBritish government turned Shell into a global company which challenged theRockefeller’s Standard Oil, even on its own ground in America. Deterding isanother man often linked with the secret funding of Adolf Hitler and a futuremajor shareholder of Shell Oil would be Prince Bernhard, a chairman and founderof the Bilderberg Group. In May 1933, Deterding entertained Hitler’srepresentative, Alfred ‘Protocols’ Rosenberg, at his estate near Windsor Castle.Researcher Oswald Dutch claims that in 1931, Deterding and his backers (theSamuel family) gave Hitler £30,000,000. Eventually the ‘oil wars’ between therival companies ended in the late 1920s with an agreement finalised atAchnacarry, Sir Henry Deterding’s Scottish Castle. This created theAnglo-American oil cartel which became known as the Seven Sisters. The meetingbetween Deterding, John Cadman of Anglo-Persian Oil (BP), and Franklin D.Roosevelt’s close friend, Walter Teagle, of the Rockefellers’ Standard Oil(Exxon), was held secretly under the cover story of a grouse shoot. The SevenSisters cartel has worked as one unit since then to control price and suppliesto suit its sordid ambitions. The ultimate control is with the Elite. The SevenSisters is comprised today of Shell, BP, Esso/Exxon (Standard Oil of NewJersey), Gulf, Mobil, Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), and Texaco. Thisvirtual amalgamation of interests and policy mirrored to an extent the post-warbanking mergers which created giants like the Rockefellers’ Chase Manhattan, theamalgamation with the Kuhn Loeb (Rothschilds), Bank of Manhattan. The oilindustry, too, was divided between the Rockefellers (Rockenfelders) and theRothschilds.Shell and BP were part of a power structure which included the Britishgovernment, the Foreign Office, and the intelligence agencies. This remains sotoday. There are countless examples of this government/oil company/intelligenceagency connection at work. In 1941, the British and the Russians invaded neutralIran on the nonsensical pretext that a few German engineers were there.Controlling the oil supplies of Iran had nothing to do with it, naturally. Thetroops, backed up by smaller Indian and American forces, took over the country’sfood supplies, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of Iranians throughstarvation. Typhus and typhoid killed yet more, as did the use of the railwayfor shipping lend-lease supplies to Russia which stopped heating oil fromreaching the Iranian people in the terrible winter of 1944–1945. These were thecountries who sat in judgement of war crimes at Nuremberg.In response to this, the Iranian nationalist leader, Dr Mohammed Mossadegh,became prime minister in April 1951. He instituted a policy of nationalising alloil production, with appropriate compensation to the foreign oil companies. TheIranian government also guaranteed supplies to Britain as before and theemployment of British workers in Iran. The British Government responded byimposing an economic stranglehold on Iran, freezing her assets held in Britishbanks, introducing full sanctions and an embargo on Iranian oil. This wassupported by other members of the Seven Sisters cartel. Mossadegh went to theUnited Nations to plead his case in 1953, but the Security Council, dominated bythe US and Britain, did not want to know. He then went to Washington for help,but again got nowhere. The US sent a ‘mediator’ to Iran with a delegation fullof people connected to the American oil companies. Who was this ‘mediator’? It’sthat man again…W. Averell Harriman. His view was that Iran should accept theBritish position of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, his old friend. I neverwould have guessed that, would you?While the British and American press assassinated Mossadegh’s character andgrossly misrepresented the situation, Iran did win its case, thanks toMossadegh’s eloquence at the World Court. But by now his downfall waswell-advanced. Appeals for economic aid from the US were turned down byPresident Dwight Eisenhower (CFR) on the advice of his Secretary of State, JohnFoster Dulles (CFR), and his brother, the CIA chief, Allen Dulles (CFR). TheDulles brothers, in concert with British Intelligence, persuaded Eisenhower thatMossadegh had to be overthrown. Seventeen key members of the Eisenhoweradministration were members of the Council on Foreign Relations.Norman Schwartzkopf senior, the father of ‘Stormin’ Norman’ of Gulf War fame,had made many contacts in the Iranian army when he trained some of theirgenerals during the war. He offered these people power if they overthrewMossadegh. A coup, organised by British Intelligence and the CIA with thecode-name, Operation AJAX, removed Mossadegh in August 1953. The Shah of Iranwas installed as a puppet of Britain and the USA until he was, himself, removedby those same forces twenty-five years later and replaced by the AyatollahKhomeini. This was part of the Elite’s ‘arc of crisis’ policy in the MiddleEast, which has ensured the Arab nations have remained divided and ruled. TheShah reversed Mossadegh’s policy and denationalised the Iranian oil industry. Heand the CIA also established SAVAK, one of the most vicious intelligenceagencies in the world. Its operatives were trained by the CIA and subjectedtheir victims to sickening torture and imprisonment without trial. From about1957 SAVAK began a close relationship with the Israeli/Global Elite intelligencearm, Mossad, which also trained SAVAK personnel. You thought Israel and Iranwere different sides? Not at the top level they aren’t.Another brave man to take on the Seven Sisters cartel was Enrico Mattei, theleader of Italy’s biggest non-communist resistance organisation in the SecondWorld War. It was Mattei who coined the term Seven Sisters. He wanted aself-sufficient Italy which was independent of the Anglo-American oil cartel. Ashead of the State energy company, ENI, he established a network of petrolstations across Italy which rivalled those of Shell and Esso. This expanded intorefineries, a vast chemical plant, a tanker fleet, and an engineeringsubsidiary. He began negotiations with Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Shahof Iran, to whom he offered 75% of all profits. Mattei was challenging the SevenSisters monopoly like no-one had before and his competition forced down petrolprices in Italy by a quarter. The last straw for the Seven Sisters came inOctober 1960 when Mattei went to Moscow to negotiate a deal to access themassive oil fields of the Soviet Union. Two years later to the month, as thepipelines were being constructed to exploit the Soviet reserves, Enrico Matteiwas killed when his private plane crashed on a flight from Sicily, the home ofthe Mafia, to Milan. Charges of deliberate sabotage continue to this day. Thehead of the CIA station in Rome, Thomas Karamessines, who would later help toorganise the coup against the Chilean leader, Salvador Allende, left Italyimmediately after the crash without explanation. The CIA chief at the time, theKnight of Malta, John McCone, owned more than $1 million worth of shares inStandard Oil of California, better known as Chevron. At the time of his death,Mattei was arranging to meet President Kennedy, who, according to someresearchers, was pressuring the oil cartel to reach agreement with the Italians.A year later Kennedy himself was assassinated.The oil companies, governments, intelligence agencies, the banks, themultinationals, the media: all of these are indivisible because all are owned orcontrolled by the same forces. The intelligence agencies work for the interestsof the oil companies and vice versa. Sir Henry Deterding was known to have beenconnected with British Intelligence as was Weetman Pearson (later Lord Cowdray),who sold his Mexican Eagle oil interests to Deterding’s Shell. Pearson (Comm300) used the profits to establish the Pearson Trust, which owns The Economistmagazine and the London Financial Times. It also holds a substantial share ofthe international merchant bank, Lazard Freres. The Economist was launched in1843 to press for the abolition of the Corn Laws and the advent of ‘free’ trade.The Oil Price ShocksThe Elite coordinate a single overall policy through the many and variouselements in the pyramid and nothing reveals more obviously how the banks, oilcompanies, and politicians work in concert than the oil price shocks of the1970s. Part of the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 was to make the dollar theworld’s premier currency and link its value to gold. It was decided that $35would equal an ounce of gold and that US gold could be redeemed for dollars. TheUnited States government, however, found itself in serious trouble by the early1970s, as so many dollars were exchanged for gold that US reserves couldn’tcope. An American financier friend, who has many contacts at high levels in theStates, says that since this time there has been little or no gold in Fort Knox,although this is obviously covered up. President Richard Nixon decided tosuspend the policy of exchanging dollars for gold. This sent the world financialsystem (those who didn’t know beforehand) into chaos. Nixon was acting on theadvice of his chief Budget Advisor, George Shultz (CFR, TC, Bil, Comm 300 andlater Kissinger Associates), Paul Volcker (CFR, TC, Bil, and future head of theFederal Reserve), and Jack F. Bennett, a future director of the Rockefellers’Exxon Oil. On Nixon’s shoulder at this time was Henry Kissinger, of course. Theother architects of Nixon’s policy were the financial institutions and merchantbanks in the City of London.The ‘City’ is alive with Freemasonry and it is no coincidence that such a smallcountry can have so much influence, via the City institutions, on the worldeconomy. The Freemasons, and more particularly Illuminised Freemasonry, run theCity and the UK Government, regardless of which party is nominally ‘in power’.Among the main characters in the manipulation of Nixon at this time were themerchant bankers, Sir Siegmund Warburg, Edmond de Rothschild, and Jocelyn Hambro(Comm 300).13 The dollar was revalued at $38 an ounce, but this was now onlytheoretical, because dollars could not be redeemed for gold. This created the socalled Eurodollar market to handle the investment of the huge flow of dollars inEurope which once bought US gold. This Eurodollar market was based on London’sfinancial centres which made colossal profits from their ‘accidental’ windfall.Lord Roll of Ipsden (then Sir Eric Roll), was one who exploited this situationto great effect and made vast sums for S.G. Warburg. Roll is a former chairmanof the Bilderberg Group, a Trilateralist, a member of the Committee of 300, anda board member of Kissinger Associates.The value of the US dollar plummeted as a result of these events, but delinkingthe dollar from its exchange for gold was only the first stage in the Elitestrategy. In May 1973, the Bilderberg Group met on an island at Saltsjoebaden,Sweden, owned by the Swedish banking family, the Wallenbergs (Comm 300). Underthe chairmanship of Prince Bernhard, the meeting brought together 84 leadingfinancial and political manipulators. They included: Lord Roll of Ipsden fromS.G. Warburg; Henry Kissinger; Robert O. Anderson, owner of Atlantic RichfieldOil; Sir Eric Drake, the chairman of BP; Sir Dennis Greenhill, a director of BP;Rene Granier de Lilliac, of French Petroleum; Gerrit A. Wagner, president ofRoyal Dutch Shell; Olof Palme (Comm 300), the later assassinated prime ministerof Sweden; George Ball of Lehman Brothers; David Rockefeller of Chase ManhattanBank; Zbigniew Brzezinski, director of the newly formed Trilateral Commissionand future national security advisor to Jimmy Carter; Giovanni Agnelli, head ofFiat; Helmut Schmidt, the German Finance Minister; Otto Wolff von Amerongen ofGerman Chambers of Commerce; and Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Also representingBritain were Denis Healey of the Labour Party and the Conservative, ReginaldMaudling, another regular Bilderberger in the 1960s and 70s. The meeting wasorganised by Robert D. Murphy, who, as US Consul in Munich, sent back favourablereports about Adolf Hitler in the 1920s.14At this meeting, a presentation was made that was to affect the entire world.Walter Levy, the US Government’s official oil economist for the Marshall Planafter the war, announced a proposal to increase the price of oil by 400%.15 Justfive months later, in October 1973, came the ‘Yom Kippur War’16 when Egypt andSyria unsuccessfully invaded Israel. It was this excuse that the Arabs used tomassively inflate the price of oil, cut production, and announce an oil embargoagainst the USA for supporting Israel. Yet again the world economy was throwninto a frenzy of pain and turmoil. In Britain, there was a three-day workingweek to preserve fuel stocks and millions lost their jobs and livelihoodsthroughout the world. The poor countries of the Third World were devastated,making them open to the next stage in the strategy – unrepayable debt. Thearchitect of the Yom Kippur War was the US National Security Advisor andSecretary of State, Henry Kissinger. The ‘shuttle diplomacy’ for which he becamefamous and much revered was, in fact, a policy of misrepresenting each side’sposition to the others, thus making war inevitable. This is what Kissinger didvia the Israeli Ambassador in Washington, Simcha Dinitz, and his diplomaticcontacts in Egypt and Syria.17 Look at the wars and terror that Kissinger hasbeen responsible for and then remember this: in this same year, 1973, Kissingerwas awarded the Nobel Peace Prize! There’s nothing like a Nobel Peace Prize tohide what is really going on. Look at some of the other recipients and thetiming. How do you win a Nobel Prize? Start a war secretly and then get thecredit for stopping it. How appropriate that Alfred Bernhard Nobel, after whomthe peace prize is named, made his fortune from the discovery of dynamite andthe manufacture of explosives!The Bilderberg Group had secured its enormous rise in the price of oil and sowell had it been done, the manipulators also had someone else to blame for it –the Arab oil-producing countries. This is a vital ingredient in every Elitestrategy. Make events happen, but find someone else to blame for them so thatyou, the ‘innocent party’, can step forward with the ‘solutions’ to the problemsyou have covertly created. All of this had been long planned. Look at thesequence of events: through 1972 and 1973 before the Yom Kippur War, themultinational oil companies in the US, like the Rockefellers’ Exxon, had beencutting back on the domestic supply of crude oil, reducing stocks to alarminglevels in time for the Arab Oil embargo and soaring prices they knew wereplanned in late 1973. The oil companies were given a free hand to do this byNixon on the advice of his aides, who included Henry Kissinger and GeorgeShultz. In February 1973, Kissinger, Shultz, and John Ehrichman (who wasimplicated in Watergate) were appointed by Nixon as an ‘energy triumvirate’ andthey effectively controlled US energy policy. Three months later came theBilderberg meeting which agreed to the 400% oil price rise. Five months afterthat came the Yom Kippur War and the price rise and oil embargo on the USA. Withdomestic supplies so low, the US economy collapsed. All these events dovetailedperfectly.We should not underestimate the role of Britain in this story. Diplomaticsources quoted in A Century Of War say that the British and Kissinger workedhand in hand in countless covert projects to manipulate events in othersovereign states. “The British, you know, were very clever” the sources said.“They were willing to let the Americans do the public dirty work and take theblame, while they worked very effectively on a more discreetlevel…(through)…Chatham House…”18 And look at what Kissinger himself said in aspeech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House on May10th 1982. Speaking of the Anglo-American special relationship, he said:> “Our postwar diplomatic history is littered with Anglo-American ‘arrangements’> and ‘understandings’, sometimes on crucial issues never put into formal> documents…The British were so matter of factly helpful that they became a> participant in internal American deliberations to a degree probably never> before practised between sovereign nations. In my period in office, the> British played a seminal role in certain American bilateral negotiations…In my> White House incarnation, then, I kept the British Foreign Office better> informed and more closely engaged than I did the American State Department.> “In my negotiations over Rhodesia, I worked from a British draft with British> spelling even when I did not fully grasp the distinction between a working> paper and a Cabinet-approved document. The practice of collaboration thrives> to this day…” 19The British Foreign Secretaries involved in the negotiations to pull the UK outof Rhodesia were David Owen, then of the Labour Party, and member of theTrilateral Commission a year after leaving office, and…Lord Carrington, nowchairman of the Bilderberg Group, a Trilateralist, and founding board member ofhis close friend’s company, Kissinger Associates. Another consequence worthy ofnote is that the leap in the price of oil suddenly made it far more financiallyviable to exploit the UK oil reserves in the North Sea by BP, Royal Dutch Shell,and others. In January 1974, Kissinger’s reluctant puppet, The Shah of Iran,demanded and achieved another 100% increase in the price of oil by theOrganisation of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC). The 400% increase decided uponby the Bilderberg Group had been achieved.Third World DebtSo what did the Elite bankers and oil companies gain from the oil price shocks?Money, power, and manufactured dependency for great swathes of humanity. Theeconomic collapse allowed the banks to accumulate yet more land, businesses,people, and control, and their oil companies flourished. In 1974, theRockefeller-owned Exxon replaced General Motors as the biggest Americancorporation. But the real motivation went well beyond that. Part of the dealbehind the scenes with the Arab oil producers was that a large percentage of thebillions of dollars the Arabs were receiving in extra revenue would be investedin the global Elite banks. The main recipients were Chase Manhattan, Citibank,Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Bank of America, Barclays, Lloyds, and Midland.They then set about ‘investing’ these enormous revenues in the poor countries ofthe world in Asia, Africa, and South America, who were forced to borrow toprevent starvation in the wake of the oil price shocks. TheRothschild-controlled Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York, led the way inthis.20 Millions of men, women, and children suffered and died from thiscallously created depression.These loans which caused the debt crisis of the 70s, 80s and 90s were theBilderberg Group’s ‘petrodollar recycling’ strategy at work. The deal with theArabs was that oil would only be purchased in dollars, and that created anotherkilling for the holders of dollars and Eurodollars in the USA and London.Kissinger ensured that the Saudi Arabians were well supervised. David Mulford,the head of the London eurodollar operations of White Weld and Company, was madedirector and senior investment advisor to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, thecountry’s central bank. In 1974, 70% of OPEC profits were invested in stocks,bonds, and land overseas. Sixty per cent of this ($57 billion) went to thefinancial institutions based in New York and London in one year alone.But even these incredible sums were nothing compared with the figures therecipient banks were actually lending to the Third World. Banks are allowed to‘create’ new money (non-existent credit) many times in excess of the wealth theyhave deposited in their vaults and on their computer screens. If they lent onlyten times the money they received from the Arabs in one year, 1974, they wouldhave loaned (and charged interest on) $570 billion. But thanks to a banking scamcalled fractional reserve lending, they could loan 26 times the funds they hadon deposit and, in some cases, 66 times! This is the ‘debt’ that has caused suchuntold famine, poverty, and death in what we call the Third World. It is creditthat does not, in reality, exist. A third fact of life on Planet Earth:The so-called third world debt which is crucifying great swathes of our fellowhumanity across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, causing unspeakable misery, isdebt on money that has never, does not, and will never exist!The banks sent out representatives in droves across the Third World, lendingmoney like confetti and looking especially for corrupt and incompetentpoliticians who they knew would waste it. Why would they do that? Because it wasthe land and natural resources of these countries the Elite are after, and stillare. They want them to default on their debts, that’s the idea. The plan was tooffer them a forgiveness of debt in return for rights over those countries’natural resources for all time. This is happening today and those leaders whorefuse are being removed in ‘people’s revolutions’ and assassinations. Thenon-existent money was lent to the Third World at flexible interest rates. Ifworld interest rates went up, the repayments increased. So, lend them the moneywhen interest rates are relatively low, and then hit them with the sting.Enter Paul Volcker, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan at exactly the righttime during the 1980s to launch the madness called monetarism which sentinterest rates, and so Third World debt, through the roof. This policy, decidedby the Elite’s International Banking Commission in Geneva, which swept acrossthe world from London and Washington in the 1980s, began with the appointment byPresident Carter of Paul A. Volcker as head of the Federal Reserve Board. ThePresident’s right to appoint the chairman of the ‘Fed’ is another little ploy tokid the people that the Federal Reserve is part of the government. Carter wastold to appoint Volcker by his puppeteer, David Rockefeller. Reagan said duringhis election campaign that he would replace Volcker. Reagan was elected, butVolcker stayed put. Volcker is a high ranking member of the CFR, the TrilateralCommission, and the Bilderberg Group. So is his successor, Alan Greenspan. Youget the picture? Monetarism, the oil price shocks, the Yom Kippur War, and ThirdWorld debt are all interconnected and part of a coordinated Elite policy to takeover the planet on behalf of the Prison Warders.Across the world in the 1980s, the regulation of the stock markets, banks, andfinancial centres, was dismantled in the name of ‘freedom’. The Elite’s controlof the world financial system reached new heights. Companies which had servedthe community for a hundred years and offered sound employment to thousands weretaken over on borrowed money by manipulating the share price and thenasset-stripped and destroyed. We heard the new wisdom of “You can’t buck themarkets” and “Set the people free”. They forgot to add “…and hand them over tothe Elite cartels”. In the United States, Ronald Reagan deregulated the savingsand loans system through the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982. This opened the doorsfor the funds of these businesses to be looted by the CIA, the Mafia, and otherorganised crime. One of them, the Silverado Bank Savings and Loan, was a CIAoperation.21 It crashed to the tune of billions of dollars which the Americantaxpayer is having to replace. On the board of Silverado Savings and Loan andits most prominent director, was Neil Bush, the son of George Bush (who had beenat the forefront of deregulation).This was the period of the yuppie, young people who could make hundreds ofthousands of pounds and more in a week by guessing the future price of commodiesdesperately produced for export by the starving Third World. The effect inAfrica, Asia, and Latin America, was beyond words. With each percentage rise inworld interest rates, the repayments and the debts themselves soared. All thisand more continues today. Yet despite all this suffering, the interest ratepolicies of the Elite and its political stooges, meant that at the end of eachever more desperate year, these countries owed more than they had owed twelvemonths before, without borrowing a single extra cent. Meantime, the Elite bankslike Citicorp, the Rockefeller/Rothschild Chase Manhattan, and the major Britishbanks were reporting record profits.The impression is given that all this debt was the result of stupid and corruptpoliticians in these countries. Yes, there are stupid and corrupt politicians inthe Third World, as there are in the House of Commons and the Congress, and theElite are quick to seek them out and often promote them into positions of power.But many politicians in the Third World are neither corrupt, nor stupid. Theirdifficulty, once again, is that the banks, multinationals, intelligenceagencies, the media, and governments, work as one entity to an agreed-uponpolicy. Because of compartmentalisation, most people involved in theseorganisations don’t even realise that this is the case. In August 1976, theheads of 85 non-aligned countries (those not involved with the USA or USSR), metin Colombo, Sri Lanka, to discuss the mounting debt crisis. Their declarationcalled for a restructuring of the global economic system to remove the rigged,built in, subservience of developing countries to the industrialised world. Italso demanded a resolution to the debt crisis which was swamping these countriesin hunger and disease. The United Nations did nothing. And one by one theleaders who signed and promoted the Colombo Declaration were removed fromoffice. Frederick Wills, the representative from Guyana, was among them. He toldthe authors of A Century Of War:> “The only Third World raw material that did well in the economic arena was> oil, but the large oil reserves were centred on the Middle East, and> manipulation of inter-Arab and Arab-Israeli conflicts, together with> inculcation of penchant for prestige projects meant that Third World oil> reserves could not be used as factors in Third World development. One by one> Third World countries were gripped by inflation and starvation, by low> life-expectancy and high infant mortality. The Old Order of Canning,> Castlereagh, Pitt, and Disraeli remains.” 22Note another reason for these policies. The culling of Third World, non-whitepeople. Eugenics. The Castlereagh mentioned there was a nineteenth centuryBritish Foreign Minister who handed over Europe to the New World Order bankers,particularly the House of Rothschild, at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Adevout student of this man’s methods was…Henry Kissinger. It was Kissinger whoblackmailed and threatened other developed countries into ignoring the appealsfrom the Third World and it was he, too, who set in motion the events that wouldremove those leaders, among them Indira Gandhi in India. This was done, as inmany other cases, by sending in the IMF to enforce policies of such austeritythat the leader was blamed and thrown out. By now he had formed his own‘consultancy’ called Kissinger Associates, the board members of which wereKissinger, Lord Carrington, Lord Roll of Ipsden, and Robert O. Anderson ofAtlantic Richfield. All except Carrington attended the Bilderberg Group meetingin Sweden which agreed the 400% increase in the price of oil. IMF debtrestructuring became the buzz words for increasing the debts without lendinganother dollar. As a result the people of the Third World continue to suffer andall the Live Aids in the world will not change that unless we address the cause– Elite exploitation with the aim of owning the planet and everything upon it,and the way the people of the Third World are programmed to expect and createthat reality.Charity events like Live Aid, Band Aid, and Comic Relief are wonderful in thatthey help to highlight the plight of the developing countries. But we need to beaddressing the cause, so that such charities are no longer needed. Charities area symbol of a global imbalance. They only exist because of that imbalance. It isnot gifts of charity which the Third World needs as a first priority, it is thedismantling of the system in which the rest of the world live off their backsand bleed them dry with the net outflow of funds and resources to theindustrialised countries (read banks) every year. The greatest gift we can givethose people is a new vision of what they can achieve and what life can be likeif they are determined to grasp it and create that reality. If you were born inunthinkable poverty and despair and in an apparently hopeless situation, you,like everyone else, would believe that life will always be like that. Aday-to-day struggle, just to survive. Such a mindset will create, and continueto attract, that reality. Breaking the spiral of despair is vital to thecreation of another and positive reality. There are many ways this can beachieved, but giving people a belief in their own potential and how they canchange their lives for the better is at the heart of any solution.Stealing the PlanetToday we continue to see the next stage in the Elite/Third World debt strategy:to forgive or restructure the debt in return for land and resources. Theenvironmental movement is playing a part, mostly unknowingly, in this. One ofthe initiatives supported by many in the environmental movement is known as‘debt for equity’. Under this proposal, the international debt of Third Worldcountries is forgiven in return for handing over areas of wilderness and‘environmentally sensitive’ lands. It is promoted as a system that wins bothways. The debts of poor countries are reduced and these wilderness and otherlands are protected. Unfortunately, the green movement in general has a verypoor record of looking behind the smokescreens thrown up by the New World Ordercrowd. Firstly, the scheme would not reduce debt; it would change the nature ofit and steal the lands of these countries. And secondly, who is behind the idea?Ladies and gentlemen let’s hear it for…David Rockefeller and Baron Edmond deRothschild! One example of this was something called The World Conservation Bank(WCB), which was apparently initiated at the Fourth World Wilderness Conference,held on September 13th 1987 at Denver, Colorado, and continued over thefollowing four days at the notorious Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies.James Baker, the US Treasury Secretary and long time buddy of George Bush, madea speech in support of the World Conservation Bank. The official host of theWorld Wilderness Conference was George W. Hunt, an accountant and investmentconsultant, who had done some reading about world conspiracy ‘theories’. Thishelped him to realise what was going on before the eyes of some genuineenvironmentalists who had no idea how they were being manipulated. An interviewwith George Hunt appeared in Moneychanger magazine in the United States. Inthat, he explained how the World Conservation Bank was being designed as a worldcentral bank to create yet more debt in the Third World and steal the lands ofthe poor while trumpeting its success in reducing debt and ‘saving theenvironment’. He said:> “…the banker Baron Edmond de Rothschild was at the meeting for six days.> Edmond de Rothschild was personally conducting the monetary matters and> creation of this World Conservation Bank, in the company of I. Michael> Sweatman of the Royal Bank of Canada. Those two were like Siamese twins, and> that’s why I say that it appears they were running at least the money side of> this conference and I would say the conference was primarily to get money.> Also, David Rockefeller (of Chase Manhattan Bank) was there and gave a speech> on Sunday…” 23The scam was to transfer the debts from the Third World countries to the WorldConservation Bank and, in return, those countries would give land to the WCB.Should the WCB collapse or get into repayment difficulties on the debts, itwould then owe its assets to the global bankers, who would be at liberty toseize the lands of the Third World. Alternatively, in the ever-gatheringcentralisation, there could be a ‘takeover’ of the WCB by the United Nations,thus giving control over the lands to this New World Order front. As the factsheet published by the Secretariat of the Wilderness Conference said:> “…plans for the WCB propose that it act as an intermediary between certain> developing countries and multilateral or private banks to transfer a specific> debt to the WCB, thus substituting an existing ‘doubtful debt’ in the bank’s> books for a new loan to the WCB. In return for having been relieved of its> debt obligation, the debtor country would transfer to the WCB natural resource> assets of ‘equivalent value’.”Problem-reaction-solution. If accepted, this would give the World ConservationBank control over 30% of the Earth’s land surface through this means alone,never mind all the rest that the Elite own. When George Hunt delivered a writtenprotest to David Rockefeller via the ‘great man’s’ bodyguard, Hunt says hereceived a warning from Rockefeller’s office saying that: “I’d better stay outof politicking or I’d regret it.”Note also that while the manipulators are quite happy for loans from othercountries to be, in effect, forgotten – ‘retained in-country’ for environmentalprojects – the loans from the Elite banks would not be forgotten. They would betransferred from the Third World Countries (‘doubtful debts’) to the WorldConservation Bank, which would guarantee the repayments in money or Third Worldland. Another well known face at this conference which initiated the WCB was theSocial Democrat Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland. This wasappropriate because she recommended an organisation like the WCB in theUN-sponsored Brundtland Report on the environment called “Our Common Future”.This was compiled in league with David Rockefeller’s ‘green’ associates, MauriceStrong (Comm 300) and Jim MacNeill, two leading lights in the UN Commission onEnvironment and Development and the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil. Same names,same agenda; on and on it goes. If it wasn’t so tragic, it would be funny. Infact, some of it is anyway. In the Moneychanger article, George Hunt reportedthe contribution to the environmental debate made by Baron de Rothschild:> “He said innovation is the key to the pollution problem. We need growth and> development. For instance, we have a CO2 problem. [Baron de Rothschild> proposed] that we create large dry ice machines that will absorb CO2 from the> atmosphere, and then take the dry ice that we create up to the polar ice cap> to keep it from melting.”> Moneychanger interviewer: “Oh, come off it.”> “No, I’m not kidding. I said to myself, this guy has either lost his mind or…> (Moneychanger interviewer in fits of uncontrollable laughter)> “…or he is just laughing at us. Isn’t that something? And by the way I’ve got> the whole conference on tape.”I tried to track down the World Conservation Bank in 1995 and no-one seemed tohave heard of it. I rang Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and the BritishGovernment’s Environment Department, and they all scratched their heads. I rangthe United Nations Environment Agency and at first they acknowledged the namebefore returning to the phone to say that they, too, had never heard of it.Maybe it never got started or maybe it is working quietly out of the public eye,I don’t know. I do hope the first one is the case. If you know what happened tothe WCB, please let me know.The Nuclear Power ‘Sting’One effect of the oil price shocks which the Elite oil cartels had to suppresswas the move to nuclear power. I have great reservations about nuclear power andI feel it is just a middle stage before we realise it is possible to harness thenatural energies of Planet Earth to give us all the safe, non-polluting, warmthand power that we need. What is clear, however, is that there has been awell-organised campaign by the oil cartels to discredit and destroy nuclearpower as a credible alternative to oil. What follows will provide more cause forreflection by the environmental movement, and give you another example of howthe network of banking/oil-business/political interests work together to deceiveand use people of genuine intent.In December 1971, McGeorge Bundy (CFR, TC, Bil), the head of the FordFoundation, arranged for the $4 million funding of a study called A Time ToChoose: America’s Energy Future. This made its report in 1974, amid the energydebate stimulated by Henry Kissinger’s oil price hike. Bundy was Kissinger’sformer dean at Harvard University and his boss for a short time when Kissingerwas a consultant to the National Security Council of John F. Kennedy. The FordFoundation report pressed for ‘alternative’ energy sources like wind and solarpower, and dismissed nuclear power. The oil cartel is quite happy with theconventional green ‘alternatives’ because they do not have the credibility toreplace oil. They fear other alternatives, however, like nuclear power and,especially, the free energy technology which uses the Earth’s energy field. Thisis why the latter has been so soundly suppressed.The expansion of nuclear power was another reason for the environmental agendawhich was being stimulated in this same period via the Club of Rome and otherElite fronts. Here again we meet one of the oilmen at that infamous BilderbergGroup meeting which agreed to the oil shocks, Robert O. Anderson, owner of theAtlantic Richfield Oil Company and a board member of Kissinger Associates. Hechannelled large sums through his Atlantic Richfield Foundation to organisationsopposed to nuclear energy. One was to become a front-runner in the environmentalmovement: Friends of the Earth. It was set up with the help of a $200,000 dollargrant from Anderson.24 He also donated to the Friends of the Earth campaignsagainst the German nuclear programme in the mid-to late-seventies by people likeFoE leader, Holger Strohm. The CFR/Rockefeller-controlled Ford and CarnegieFoundations poured millions into the environmental campaigns and pressuregroups, as did the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Rockefeller Foundation, theRockefeller Family Fund, and the Rockefeller-connected Mellon Foundations (GulfOil).25The French Friends of the Earth director, Brice LaLonde, was a partner in theRockefeller law firm, Coudert Brothers, in Paris. LaLonde was appointedEnvironment Minister in 1989 by the Freemason, François Mitterand (Comm 300).Robert O. Anderson, the multimillionaire oilman, was chairman of his owncreation, the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Where was most of theWilderness Conference held which discussed the World Conservation Bank? …theAspen Institute. Anderson has used Aspen as part of his anti-nuclear powerstrategy and to highlight the environment as a global problem in need of aglobal – centralised – solution. Aspen is partly funded by the RockefellerBrothers Fund. Some of the trustees of the Aspen Institute were Robert McNamara(CFR, TC, Bil and World Bank President), Richard Gardner (CFR,TC, Bil, Comm300), Lord Bullock of Oxford University, Russell Paterson of Lehman Brothers,Kuhn, Loeb Inc., and oil executives of Exxon, Gulf, and Mobil. Andersonappointed Joseph Slater from the Ford Foundation as Aspen President. Here we hada close knit and cosy bunch of pro-oil, New World Order manipulators. Surelythere would not be an environmentalist to be seen in such company!But wait, who’s this? There is a Maurice Strong named on the Aspen InstituteBoard. It couldn’t possibly be the same Maurice Strong I mentioned earlier asthe friend of David Rockefeller, could it? The Maurice Strong who was the firsthead of the UN Environment Agency and ‘Mr Green’ at the 1992 Earth Summit inRio? It surely could. Given that this ‘environmentalist’ is a Canadian oil man,he would have had a lot in common with his fellow directors.Aspen financed an international network linked to the UN called theInternational Institute for Environment and Development and on its board wereAnderson, Strong, McNamara, and Roy (Lord) Jenkins, from Britain, the Labourcabinet minister, founder of the Social Democratic Party, head of the EuropeanCommission, Bilderberger, member of the Trilateral Commission, and a presidentof the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Anderson’s strategy was timedto be ready to attack the nuclear power industry when its credibility was at itspeak – the period following the leap in oil prices. Atlantic Richfield and theRockefellers funded the anti-nuclear ‘green’ lobby, including the World WildlifeFund, chaired by the Bilderberg Group’s Prince Bernhard, and later byTrilateralist and Rockefeller associate, John Loudon, an executive of thecompany of which Bernhard was a major shareholder, Royal Dutch Shell.Today the WWF, now called the Worldwide Fund for Nature, is headed by PrincePhilip (Bil), the environmentalist with a love of shooting birds from the sky.It is not only Prince Philip who can be seen to have a smoking gun in his hand.So can many who have shaped the environmental debate and the ‘solutions’ toThird World debt. It really is time for those in the green movement whogenuinely care for the planet – the majority – to wake up and take another lookat what they are involved in. There is one heck of a confidence trick going on.Researcher, Dr Kitty Little, suggests another reason for the Elite’s attack onnuclear power. Dr Little worked at the British Atomic Energy Establishment atHarwell between 1949 and 1958, and she has been a major contributor at thepublic inquiries into the nuclear power complexes at Windscale (Sellafield) andHinkley Point. Her research and contacts over more than 50 years led her tobelieve that the French arm of the House of Rothschild is seeking to monopoliseuranium and nuclear power technology, together with the technology forreprocessing spent fuel. Dr Little says they are planning to achieve thismonopoly by the time gas and oil supplies are running out. In pursuit of this,they are using environmental concerns and political manoeuvring to destroy thecoal industry and to stop the development of nuclear power and reprocessing bynational governments. They want to hoard the rights to this know-how themselvesfor when the world is running out of energy. The privatisation of the Britishelectricity industry was part of this strategy of controlling energy supplies,Dr Little says. Who privatised British electricity and helped to run down thecoal industry? Lord Wakeham. Who did he work for after he left the government?N.M. Rothschild. Who advised the government on the privatisation of electricity,coal, and gas? N.M. Rothschild. Who advised the Hanson multinational in itsefforts to acquire the privatised Eastern Electricity in August 1995? N.M.Rothschild. The alleged KGB spy Donald Maclean was, in fact, feeding geologyreports to Guy Rothschild in France, detailing where resources had been located,including uranium. Maclean had access to these reports in his job at the ForeignOffice. According to Dr Little, the Rothschilds now control 80% of world uraniumsupplies.26I stress that I am not attacking Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and theenvironmental movement in general. They have done some good work overall. I ammerely pointing out that they can, and are, used to promote the New World Order,mostly (though certainly not in every case) without their knowledge. Again theElite are not ‘pro’ or ‘anti’ the environmental movement. They will use it whenit suits their interests and undermine it when it doesn’t. The British Friendsof the Earth campaigns director, Andrew Lees, a man I met and had great respectfor, was found dead in Madagascar in January 1995 where he was filming the siteof a proposed two billion pound mine, a joint venture between a subsidiary ofthe London-based multinational, Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ), and the Madagascargovernment. The official verdict of a ‘heart attack’ sounds very convenient andcoincidental to me. When environmentalists can be duped into advancing the NewWorld Order agenda, they are supported, congratulated, and patted on the head.When they are behaving in ways that oppose the plans of those in power, quiteanother approach is used towards them. So it is with all people and all subjectareas.When Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Ali Bhutto, proposed an expansion of hiscountry’s nuclear power programme, he came under tremendous pressure from HenryKissinger by August 1976 to drop the plan. Independent power supplies ofwhatever kind are not good for control and what the Elite fear more thananything is someone setting a good example that others will follow. Whathappened to Bhutto also fits in with Dr Little’s contention about the monopolyof nuclear technology. According to some Pakistani sources, Kissinger said thatunless the policy was changed he would “make a terrible example of Pakistan.”27Bhutto still refused and by 1977 he was overthrown in a military coup led byGeneral Zia Ul-Haq, who reversed Pakistan’s policy of independence from the USBhutto named Kissinger as the force behind the coup and, because he knew toomuch and was prepared to say it, the controlling world community sat on itshands while Bhutto was hanged. From his prison cell, Bhutto wrote:> “Dr Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State for the United States, has a> brilliant mind. He told me that I should not insult the intelligence of the> United States by saying that Pakistan needed the Reprocessing Plant for her> energy needs. In reply, I told him that I will not insult the intelligence of> the United States by discussing the energy needs of Pakistan, but in the same> token, he should not insult the sovereignty and self-respect of Pakistan by> discussing the plant at all. I got the death sentence.” 28The list continues to mount. Even the campaign against nuclear power leads tothe same people and the same agenda. And by the way, it was the Elite-puppet,General Zia Ul-Hag, who was used to trigger the war in Afghanistan.What Next?What can we expect the banking-business manipulators to do from this point on?The Elite want the introduction of a world central bank that would run theplanet as the Federal Reserve now runs America. All banks and money-flows wouldbe controlled by the handful of people who would control the World Central Bank.The idea is to concentrate power into regional centres, as with the EuropeanCentral Bank, and then fuse them together as one. The present World Bank and IMFwould be absorbed into this centralised global financial dictatorship. In thesame way, the proposed European currency is a stepping-stone to the plannedone-world currency. The momentum towards this centralisation will be furtheredby increasing pressure to allow the United Nations to levy taxation via tariffson all air travel, cross-border trade, or other means, to give it an incomeindependent of the sovereign states it is supposed to be serving. It can thenfund its own empire and the world army, which is being created by fusing NATOwith the UN ‘peacekeeping’ forces. The world army is designed to ensure that nonation refuses to concede to the global dictators. The manipulation is seekingto intertwine all economies and governments into a global system, from whicheven those who eventually see what is going on will find it very difficult todelink. You only have to read the newspapers and the Elite publications to seewhat is afoot. In 1984, Professor Richard N. Cooper (CFR, TC) said in the CFR’sForeign Affairs propaganda sheet that the world required a new monetary system:> “…I suggest a radical alternative scheme for the next century; the creation of> a common currency for all the industrial democracies [sic], with a common> monetary policy and a joint Bank of Issue to determine that monetary policy.> …The key point is that monetary control – the issuance of currency and of> reserve credit – would be in the hands of the new Bank of Issue, not in the> hands of any national government. …A single currency is possible only if there> is in effect a single monetary policy, and a single authority issuing the> currency and directing the monetary policy. How can independent states> accomplish that? They need to turn over the determination of monetary policy> to a supranational body.” 29This has been the Global Elite’s game plan for centuries. The manoeuvrings andthe politic-speak can be observed every day. Look at what President Bill Clintonand the other heads of the elite Group of Seven (industrial nations), said inthe summer of 1994. Under the headline “G7 reaches out for new order – UN andfinance reforms urged”, the London Guardian reported on July 11th:> “The West’s leading industrial powers yesterday took the first tentative steps> towards the creation of a post-Cold War economic and political order, calling> for a fresh look at the Bretton Woods financial institutions and a revitalised> United Nations…> “…At the initiation of President Clinton and with the support of President> Mitterand, the Group of Seven pledged itself to a revamp of the International> Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the G7 itself. The world needed new global> economic institutions to ‘ensure the future prosperity and security of our> people’, Saturday’s communiqué said.”The global currency is not intended to be physical money. It will be entirelycredit, figures on a computer screen. The plan is to replace all paper money andcoins, and even credit cards, with a bar code inserted under the skin of everyhuman being. This barcoding would be programmed with all the details about us,including our financial assets. You would go into a shop and pay for the goodsby holding the bar code, probably in your wrist, over a beam at the check out.This will read the bar code, check that you have enough credit, and reprogrammeyour under-the-skin bank statement to remove the amount you have just spent.This offers enormous potential for control. At present, if you go into a shopand the computer refuses your credit card, you can pay with cash. But whathappens when cash no longer exists and the computer says no to your barcoding?You have no means to purchase anything. And, naturally, those who campaignagainst the (by then) global fascist/communist dictatorship, will find that thecomputer doesn’t want to know. Far fetched? Not in the least. The technologyalready exists and it is only a case of bouncing public opinion into acceptingit. We will be told that this system will end all tax evasion (no ‘readies’ toavoid taxation), stop credit card fraud, and help to fight the ‘war on drugs’, aclassic problem-reaction-solution scenario, because the Elite control theillegal drugs market. Credit cards are a stepping-stone to lead us along theroad to barcoding and the end of cash, just as microchipped identity cards arealso stepping-stones to the under-the-skin microchip which will connect uspermanently to a central computer – if we don’t wake up and stop it.The day I completed a draft of this chapter, or thought I had, I went into thenext room to read the newspaper. It was the London Times of January 6th 1995,and in there I found an article by writer Paul Penrose, headed “Will plasticsmart cards be Europe’s common currency?” All that I had been writing that day,and had outlined in The Robots’ Rebellion, was there before me. The best bankingbrains of the European Union are designing the money of the future, the articlesaid. It made the point that the introduction of the planned European currencywould be very costly for governments and businesses with all the new notes andcoins involved. So there was a problem. What could the solution be, one wondersexpectantly? It couldn’t just be..? Oh yes it could. I quote:> “One novel solution is to phase out physical cash altogether. Under this> scenario, electronic money [credit] loaded into a microchip embedded in a> plastic card would become the symbolic common currency of a united Europe. In> the Federal superstate of the next millennium, there may be no rustle of> Euro-notes, no jingle of Euro-coins, just the battery operated blip of> machine-readable data changing hands.”And, of course, something will be found to be less than perfect about thissystem once it is introduced and the cash has gone. The solution to this‘problem’ will be the barcoded human being. What is clearly planned to hurryalong the world central bank and one world currency is a global crash andcurrency chaos, using the tried and trusted methods. For that to work and thepublic mind to be conned, the Elite will need to find a scapegoat for the crash,so the bankers and politicians can appear over the horizon on their white horsesto offer the solution.An Englishman called Jonathan May, who worked in financial and oil circles formany years, realised what was going on and began to tell anyone who wouldlisten. He tried to form a group of wealthy people who could construct analternative money system to the one the Elite controlled. Threats were made onhis life in England and he moved to America to continue his work. When he triedto introduce a non-interest credit system for Minnesota farmers struggling undera mountain of debt, it was crushed by the Federal Reserve. He was charged withfraud and jailed for 45 years.May says that not only did he not commit the crime – no crime actually tookplace! May’s view is that the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the tidal waveof petrodollars channelled from the Arabs, through the Elite banks, to the ThirdWorld, were part of the plan to crash the global economy at some future date.The Arab oil producers, especially Saudi Arabia, didn’t realise what they werebeing used for, May says, nor that the global oil and banking cartels were ownedby the same people. He believes the plan is to forgive the debt of the ThirdWorld countries when the time is suitable in return for the rights to theirnatural resources forever. This, says May, would mean the Arabs would lose theirpetrodollars held on deposit for a fixed term in the global banks (or rather,held by the companies created at arms’ length from these banks to protect themfrom the consequences of such action). Arab nations would then have to raisecash flow by selling off enormous amounts of their shares, land holdings,property, and businesses throughout the United States and the industrialisedworld. This, May’s scenario continues, would collapse the global economy and the‘greedy’ Arabs would get the blame for it. The bankers and politicians of theElite in the midst of the chaos and turmoil would step forward with thesolution…the end of cash and a one world credit currency administered by a worldcentral bank.I don’t know if that is precisely correct, but Jonathan May was obviously sayingsomething the Elite didn’t want the people to hear. I am sure the plan involvesevents similar to this in outcome, if not in detail. May also reveals that thewhole confidence trick is made possible by the unique privileges enjoyed by thebanking trusts set up by the original John D. Rockefeller. Such trusts havesince become illegal, but the ones already created have been allowed tocontinue. May says that the ownership of these trusts was vested in thirteenlong-established banking families, most of which will have been mentioned inthis book.The Food BankAnother aim of the Elite is to control the land and production of food at everylevel of the process. The natural crop seed varieties are being systematicallydestroyed and replaced by genetically-engineered seeds, which a handful ofElite-controlled multinational companies are patenting. Under Plant Breeder’sRights legislation, anyone using these seeds must pay a royalty to thesecompanies or face a six-month jail sentence or fines of up to $250,000. Thisapplies to anyone from a Western farmer to a poverty-stricken peasant inBangladesh. The same ‘patents’ are being applied to all plants, animals, fungi,genes, and viruses, that have been genetically tampered with. The Uruguay Roundof the GATT agreement has increased the hold that companies like Britain’s ICI(supported by BP) and the US giants have over global seed varieties. This isgiving them control over what we eat and even if we eat. This was the GATTagreement that the politicians, the media, and the big-name news presenters weretelling us was so vital to our economic well-being!The ‘Green Revolution’ of the 1960s and 70s which was sold as a means to feedthe poor countries of the world was, in truth, a means to steal the naturalplant varieties used there and replace them with hybrids dependent on chemicalinputs which the same companies monopolise. The chemical inputs are killing theland and the body, in another form of population control. Control and dependencywas the plan. The Rockefeller Foundation collected the seeds from 95% of theworld’s major cereal crops in the years leading up to the GATT Agreement and thePlant Breeder’s Rights Bills. The multinationals are phasing out the varietiesthey do not have rights to and making the world dependent on those that they do.UN statistics estimate that 75% of genetic diversity in agricultural crops hasbeen lost in this century and what is left is now in great danger. More than1,500 varieties of vegetable seeds were withdrawn from use in England in thefirst few years after a national list of ‘approved’ species was established. Thecosts of registering seed varieties is so high that only the multinationals cando it and yet genetically-engineered varieties forced upon Third World countriesare often useless in those environments. This adds to the hunger and debt. InIndia, a million farmers took to the streets when a US patent was awarded forthe active genes of the neem tree, which has been used for centuries as a herbalremedy. No-one should own the patent to any seed or animal and especially notthe mindset that controls the multinationals.The farming policies of the European Community and those demanded by GATT havebeen designed to destroy the small and medium-sized farmer and allow the landand the market to be taken over almost entirely by the multinationalcorporations across the world. Over-production in agriculture, the butter‘mountains’ and the wine ‘lakes’, has not been caused by stupidity. It has beencalculated to destroy smaller farms. What is happening to the smaller farmers inthe industrialised countries is only a continuation and expansion of thepolicies used to steal the land of the Third World farmers. Ninety per cent ofthe food trade on this planet is in the hands of five multinationals. Half ofour supplies are controlled by two of them, the Anglo-Dutch giant, Unilever(controlled by Bilderberg group clones), and the Nestlé corporation in the Elitestronghold of Switzerland. Once again we see that ‘free trade’ is reallycartelism, the means through which the vast destroy the small and get paid fordoing so with public money. As John D. Rockefeller Jr once said: “Competition isa sin.”30 In the European Union it is estimated that the multinationals receivebetween 10 and 12 billion German marks every year, merely for transporting goodsand raw materials across national borders to repackage them and give the goods a‘national image’. The biggest beneficiary is Unilever, which has close familyties to the Sainsbury Supermarket Empire. Unilever increased profits in one yearby 25.6%, at the same time that farming incomes in Denmark dropped by 35.3% andin Germany by 27.5%. Such are the profits to be made for the corporations thateven car companies like Volkswagen and Daimler Benz entered the cattle-breedingmarket, a business which has led to the destruction of enormous swathes ofrainforest.This all fits into the global plan for dependency and control of every aspect ofour lives. They want us literally to be robots, programmed to do as we are told,and the banking/business system is the backbone of this strategy. As with thewars and conflicts, I hope you can see that there is no need for all the povertyand economic suffering that we can hardly bear to witness on our televisionscreens. This doesn’t have to happen. We allow it to happen. There is enough foreveryone – enough food, enough warmth, enough for all we need for a good life –yes, even with the number of people currently occupying Planet Earth. Thesuffering and poverty are there by design to control us, to divide and rule, andto create the fear within us that if we don’t conform and play the game by therules of the Elite, we will end up in dire straits, also. Everyone forthemselves. Winner takes all. It is a battle called survival, a battle to thedeath. The collective human mind has taken on those thought patterns and createdthis reality.But remember, remember, remember. It doesn’t have to be like this. This doesn’thave to be the future. We are creating the future with every thought and act. Ifwhat we think and do changes, so will the future. If you summon your courage andget off your knees, we can leave our children a world that is truly, truly,free. There is nothing and no-one who can stop us, if enough people demand anend to this manipulation and are prepared to work unceasingly to that goal.

Thehidden hand of the Elite and its pyramid of deception can be shown to be behinda stream of officially unconnected political assassinations and scandals.For instance, what apparent link can there be between the assassination ofPresident John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Oklahoma bomb in 1995, the Vietnam War,and the drugs-for-arms operation during the Reagan-Bush administration in the1980s, known as Iran-Contra? What could be the connection between theassassinations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, the Watergate scandal whichbrought down Richard Nixon, the Bay of Pigs invasion against Castro’s Cuba in1961 which did much to discredit John F. Kennedy, the removal of MargaretThatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1990, and the suppression ofinformation about the UFO phenomenon which has been identified since the war?The answer is the Elite and the cult of the All-Seeing Eye.The same force has been behind all of these events and countless others which,on the surface and in the media, are not connected in any way. In this chapter,I’m going to show how these political assassinations and events were part of thesame ongoing plan, which removes anyone who gets in the way, either by physicalor character assassination. Understanding this is important because one methodthrough which the human mind is diverted from seeing these connections is foreach event to be promoted as a ‘one-off’. This is done by the ‘lone assassin/noconspiracy’ approach. The same strategy is used when each national civil war andrevolution is said to be confined only to that country, and not part of a worldrevolution instigating trouble across the planet toward a common end.The Vietnam WarSo many events and implications were triggered by the war in Vietnam. The UnitedStates embarked on that debacle, the public were told, to challenge the spreadof ‘communism’. We have already seen that ‘communism’ was the creation of thesame Elite who publicly promote ‘capitalism’. There is, therefore, anotherreason behind a war that killed so many on both ‘sides’. Retired Air ForceColonel L. Fletcher Prouty was chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefsof Staff during the Kennedy years and he was directly in charge of the globalsystem providing military support for the covert activities of the CIA. He wrotea book called The Secret Team and in the film, JFK, the character Colonel X wasapparently based on Prouty who advised the film-makers.1 On April 13th 1995,Prouty talked on Radio Free America about the background to the Vietnam War. Hesaid that on January 29th 1954, the CIA Director, Allen Dulles, secured approvalduring a meeting at the White House for the creation of an organisation calledthe Saigon Military Mission. The man selected to head this ‘Mission’ was thethen Colonel Edward Lansdale, who had been working with the CIA to overthrow thegovernment of the Philippine President, Ramon Magsaysay. The idea was to moveLansdale to Vietnam to do the same sort of work there. Vietnam at that time hadbeen divided at the 17th parallel into North and South Vietnam by somethingcalled the Geneva Agreement. There were to be elections and either Ho Chi Minhin the North or Ngo Dinh Diem in the South would be elected to rule over all ofthe country. That was the theory, anyway.The Elite wanted a war instead. This would provide massive profits for the banksand arms companies (the same people), help to destabilise American society,create divide and rule in the Far East, and provide a cover for an enormoustrade in hard drugs. Prouty said that to create the appearance of an enemy tojustify a war, the Saigon Military Mission (Allen Dulles and the CIA) embarkedon “psychological warfare” – terrorism. They moved more than a millionVietnamese from the North to the South between 1954 and 1955. American Navytransports carried more than 657,000 of them and CIA airlines transported300,000. Hundreds of thousands of others were persuaded to walk. These peoplehad no food or money and they began to form into gangs of bandits to steal whatthey needed to survive. As this began to grow, the Americans who had purposelycreated the problem, dubbed these bandit gangs “insurgency movements” from theNorth and they were given the name the “Viet Cong”. Thus the ‘justification’ hadbeen created (problem-reaction-solution) for the Vietnam War.Robert McNamara (CFR, TC, Bil), Kennedy’s defense secretary at the time ofVietnam, and later head of the World Bank, has now publicly confessed thatVietnam was a war that should never have been fought. He said that it was a warthat the United States could not win and never even tried to win. Indeed, hemight have added that it was a war that was never officially declared.McNamara’s middle name is “Strange” and it was an inspired choice given hisimmense record of manipulation. He was the man behind the jungle clearancesusing the notorious Agent Orange. Quite why he has chosen to ‘reveal all’ now isnot clear. Both McNamara and Prouty agree that President Kennedy wanted towithdraw from Vietnam and end the war. Prouty says that Kennedy approved adocument called National Security Action Memorandum 263. This said that all USsoldiers and other personnel would be out of Vietnam by 1965. This followed astream of meetings called by the president to discuss Vietnam, most of which arerecorded in the Government Printing Office publication, Foreign Relations Of TheUnited States 1961–1963 (Volume IV): Vietnam (August to December 1963). McNamarasays that Kennedy also refused to endorse the introduction of US combat forcesin Vietnam. The Elite, however, did not want the war over that quickly and afterKennedy was assassinated in 1963 there was no withdrawal. According to McNamara,the successor to Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, released false reports about a NorthVietnamese attack on US destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. No such attack tookplace, McNamara says, but thanks to the unquestioning reporting of this ‘fact’by the media, it further “justifed” the escalation of the war.2 Throughout the1960s, employees of the Morgan banking empire were officials in the militaryarms of government.On July 4th 1971, a group of young Americans gathered in Detroit, Michigan, toissue a formal indictment against a list of people they said were responsiblefor the carnage called Vietnam. The men they named were: William F. Buckley Jr;Daniel Ellsberg; Henry Kissinger; Henry Cabot Lodge; Robert McNamara; AndreMeyer; David Rockefeller; Nelson Rockefeller; Dean Rusk; Walt W. Rostow; andMaxwell D. Taylor. Those names abound with members of the Council on ForeignRelations and the Bilderberg Group. To tell the full truth, that list needs tobe very much longer. Vietnam was just another engineered human catastrophe. Ithappened only because it was made to happen in pursuit of the New World Order.Yet if you recall, the boxer Muhammed Ali was jailed for the ‘crime’ of refusingto take part and American men are still looked down upon for “avoiding thedraft” to Vietnam. Being someone else’s cannon fodder makes you a ‘man’, doesit? Others were treated like lepers when they came back from Vietnam because ofthe way American ‘pride’ had been damaged by failing to win. My God. My God.John F KennedyPresident Kennedy’s alleged ‘lone assassin’, Lee Harvey Oswald, was an asset ofthe CIA who was set up to take the blame. He was the ‘patsy’, as they say inAmerica. Investigations by New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison, showedthat Oswald could not possibly have been responsible. Anyway, as the cine filmtaken by onlooker Abraham Zapruder proves, Kennedy was killed by shots from thefront of the car, not the back where Oswald is supposed to have been shootingfrom a book depository.3 The assassination was the work, not of one man, but ofa highly trained and coordinated squad of professionals. Oswald, who realisedhe’d been set up and was prepared to say so in court, was taken through a publicplace where the nightclub owner Jack Ruby killed him. Ruby himself later diedvery conveniently or at least disappeared. The plan was complete. It was a loneassassin and the lone assassin was now dead. End of story. Long live PresidentJohnson.District Attorney Jim Garrison, the man featured in the film, JFK, is still theonly person to have tried a suspect with the murder of the president. This wasClay Shaw. Garrison’s case against Shaw was severely damaged by the intimidationand murder of his main witnesses and Shaw was found not guilty. Later it becameknown that Shaw had been working for the CIA all along. Shaw was also a directorof Permindex, a Mossad front company which operated as an assassination bureau.Garrison established that witnesses to the assassination were threatened whenthey gave a version of events that did not match the official line. Many peoplewho gave evidence to the Warren Commission which ‘investigated’ theassassination said that their statements were altered in the report and in somecases their signatures were forged on statements they did not make. There wereso many obvious indications of official murder and official cover-up. Kennedy’sbody was rushed out of Dallas for a ‘post mortem’ in Washington, under militarycontrol. The pathologist was surrounded by officials while the examination tookplace and he was told what to find. The president’s brain, the examination ofwhich would have shown the direction of the bullets that killed him, went‘missing’ and has never been found. Scores of other people who clearly knewsomething about the assassination went to an early death by car crash, shooting,or the Global Elite classic, the faked ‘suicide’. The events in Dallas, Texas,on that tragic day, November 22nd 1963, were an Elite coup on the United Statesof America. It was so well done that very few even noticed that a coup hadindeed taken place.There has been endless speculation about who killed Kennedy. Was it the CIA? TheMafia? Who? As usual, much disinformation has been spread to confuse and divert,but when you look at the pyramid nature of the manipulation, it probablyinvolved many different agencies who were controlled by the Elite. This waythere could be coordination between elements within the CIA, the FBI, theorganised crime syndicate, the Dallas police department, the military, the‘Justice’ Department, the media, the incoming President Johnson, and manyothers. Freemasonry was certainly a thread in this, too. Near the site of thekilling today is an obelisk monument to Freemasonry with the flame of Luciferpositioned on the top. Mossad and the CIA were the prime agencies involved, Ibelieve, right down to the driver of Kennedy’s car, agent William Greer. Thebasic training of all drivers in intelligence agencies and security firms allover the world is: If you hear shots, your right foot hits the floor, and youget the hell out of the area as fast as the car will move. Greer stopped! Maybehe was a reincarnation of the guy who drove the Archduke Ferdinand.John and Bobby Kennedy were clearly bad news for the Elite for some reason,probably more than one. JFK’s was a Bilderberg Group presidency, as Carter’s wasa Trilateral Commission administration. Kennedy, as far as I know, was not aBilderberger, but many of his leading staff were. Dean Rusk, George W. Ball,McGeorge Bundy, Arthur Dean, Walter Roscow, George McGhee, Robert McNamara, andPaul Nitze were all Bilderbergers. His assistant secretary and undersecretary ofstate, was… Averell Harriman, one of the main architects of the Vietnam War.Kennedy had asked the Brown Brothers, Harriman partner, Robert Lovett, to givehim a list of possible candidates for his Cabinet! He also accepted the adviceof Nelson Rockefeller to appoint Dean Rusk as his secretary of state, a man hehad never even met.4 Rusk took leave of absence from his job as head of theRockefeller Foundation, to accept the job. Kennedy (CFR) also ‘chose’ DouglasDillon (CFR) to be secretary of the treasury. Dillon was a trustee of theRockefeller Brothers Fund. Rockefeller-connected place men have also held thetreasury post under Eisenhower, Johnson, and probably every other president ofmodern times.It is worth looking at the Kennedy assassination in some detail because itoffers a superb example of the methods used by the Elite and the extent of theirinfluence on events. I am indebted in parts of this section to the brilliantbook by Michael Collins Piper called Final Judgement, The Missing Link In TheJFK Assassination Conspiracy. John F. Kennedy was the son of Joseph P. Kennedy,the US Ambassador to London at the time that Tyler Kent was being jailed forrevealing the shocking pre-war cables between Roosevelt and Churchill. JoeKennedy was a sinister character who operated in the criminal underworld andmade a fortune out of running booze during the prohibition era. He apparentlyhad no love for Jewish people to say the least and he became a bitter enemy ofMeyer Lansky, the head of the Organised Crime Syndicate. There were two maingroups within organised crime, La Cosa Nostra, better known as the ItalianMafia, and the Jewish operation dubbed the “Kosher Nostra”. Lansky led thelatter and, contrary to popular myth and media stories, it was he, not theItalians, who was the “boss of bosses” in organised crime. Joe Kennedy’s bitterrelationship with Lansky worsened still further, it would appear, after Lansky’smen highjacked one of Kennedy’s consignments of bootleg whisky from Ireland.5According to the family of Chicago Mafia boss, Sam Giancana, the “Jewish Mafia”in Detroit, the so called Purple Gang, issued a contract on Joe Kennedy’s lifefor operating his liquor activities through their territory. Kennedy, theGiancanas’ say, went to Chicago to plead for his life with the Mafia bosses andtheir influence saved him.6 This was the background from whence emerged John F.Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States.When JFK turned his eyes to the presidency he had a number of hurdles toovercome, especially the Kennedys’ deep animosity with the Jewish lobby in theUS and the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate. Kennedy needed the money and support ofboth the Jewish lobby and organised crime if he was to have any chance ofwinning. In 1957, he further enraged Israel (the Rothschilds/Global Elite) andits massive network in the US when, as a young senator, he supported the demandsby Algeria for independence from France. Israel bitterly opposed this. Butfather Joe Kennedy decided to swallow his pride and put aside his feelings tomake sure his son became president. According to DeWest Hooker, a New Yorkentertainment executive, he once approached Joe Kennedy with a business proposalto set up a television network independent of Jewish money and control. Hookersays of the meeting:> “Joe admitted that when he was ambassador to England that he had been> pro-Hitler. However, in Kennedy’s words, ‘we’ lost the war. By ‘we’ he didn’t> mean the United States. When Kennedy said ‘we’, he meant the non Jews. Joe> Kennedy believed that it was the Jews who had won World War II.> “Kennedy said: ‘I’ve done everything I can to fight the Jewish power over this> country. I tried to stop World War II, but I failed. I’ve made all the money I> need and now I’m passing everything I’ve learned to my sons’.> “I don’t go with the ‘loser’, Kennedy told me. ‘I’ve joined the “winners.” I’m> going to work with the Jews. I’m teaching my boys the whole score and they’re> going to work with the Jews. I’m going to make Jack the first Irish Catholic> President of the United States and if it means working with the Jews, so be> it. I have sympathy with what you’re doing Hooker’, Kennedy said ‘but I’m not> going to do anything that will ruin Jack’s chances to become president’.” 7Events certainly support Hooker’s claims. Joe Kennedy arranged for planted‘news’ stories to appear claiming Nazi support for his son’s opponent, RichardNixon, and JFK began a series of meetings with the Jewish lobby, particularlyAbraham Feinberg, the president of the Israel Bond Organization who, unbeknownto Kennedy at the time, was raising private money for Israel’s secret nuclearprogramme headed by Victor Rothschild.8 Kennedy assured him that he would begood for Israel and the US Jewish lobby. Feinberg said of Kennedy: “My path topower was cooperation in terms of what they needed – campaign money”.9 Feinbergapparently produced a donation of $500,000 from Jewish sources. Privately,however, Kennedy was appalled at what he was seeing. The newspaper columnist,Charles L. Bartlett, said that Kennedy, a close friend, had driven over to seehim after the meeting with Feinberg and company. Bartlett said: “As an Americancitizen he was outraged to have a Zionist Group come to him and say: “We knowyour campaign is in trouble. We’re willing to pay your bills if you’ll let ushave control of your Middle East policy”.10Bartlett said Kennedy had pledged that if he became president he would end thepower of special interest groups, particularly foreign ones, to dictate theoutcome of election campaigns and foreign policy through their financial andpolitical manipulation. In the meantime he had clearly decided that he neededtheir money to win power in the first place, as he did with Meyer Lansky and theMafia. Joe Kennedy went back to Sam Giancana of the Chicago Mafia, who saved hislife when the Jewish mobsters put a contract on him. Giancana’s family say thatFather Kennedy begged Giancana to support his son in the election and agreed adeal. When Giancana said he was not convinced that Kennedy could offer himanything for his help, father Kennedy is said to have replied:> “I can. And I will. You help me now, Sam, and I’ll see to it that Chicago –> that you – can sit in the goddamned Oval Office if you want. That you’ll have> the president’s ear. But I just need time…My son, the President of the United> States, will owe you his father’s life. He won’t refuse you ever. You have my> word.” 11JFK, meanwhile, was making his own deals with the mobsters. FBI phone taps anddocuments reveal that John “Jack” Kennedy had “direct contact” with Meyer Lanskyduring the 1960 presidential campaign.12 So here we had a situation in which theKennedys’ had agreed pacts with the Israeli lobby (Israel and the Rothschilds ineffect) and organised crime. In return the Israelis/Rothschilds wanted controlof President Kennedy’s Middle East policy and the mob wanted to be left alone tooperate their international crime syndicate, headed by Meyer Lansky, withoutinterference from the government law enforcement agencies. They were in for ashock on both counts. Kennedy double crossed them and they were besidethemselves with rage and resentment. Both would be involved in Kennedy’sassassination.As Michael Collins Piper reveals so superbly in his book, Final Judgement, thereare key elements to the Kennedy story that have been suppressed because of wherethat knowledge would lead – Israel. Kennedy won the 1960 election by just100,000 votes, the smallest margin in American history, a confirmation of howcrucial the financial and political support from the Israeli lobby and organisedcrime turned out to be. But JFK had no intention, it would seem, of giving themwhat they paid for. Quite the opposite. Almost from his inauguration, Kennedywaged a secret war with Israel and it’s prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, overAmerican policy in the Middle East and Israel’s nuclear weapons programme.13Kennedy decided on a “no favourites” policy in the Middle East to ensureAmerican influence in all those countries and he was horrified when he heard ofIsrael’s development of a nuclear bomb. Ben-Gurion denied his country had such aprogramme, but as history has shown, he was lying. Abraham Feinberg, whoarranged for Kennedy’s election funding from the Israeli lobby, told thepresident that his demands for inspections of Israel’s nuclear plant at Dimona,could “result in less support in the 1964 presidental election”.14 In 1962 and’63, Kennedy also introduced a total of seven bills to Congress to reform thelaws over campaign financing by special interest groups. All of them werecrushed by the lobbying of those same groups. Kennedy was becoming seriouslyunpopular with the thugs and terrorists who controlled, and control, Israel atthe expense of Jewish people as a whole.Kennedy further increased the tension with his support for a just solution tothe problem of Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel. He pressured Israel atthe United Nations to conform to a UN resolution demanding justice for therefugees, but Israel’s foreign minister, Golda Meir (a later prime minister)described her “astonishment and anger” at Kennedy’s policy. All this addedmassively to the hostility with Ben-Gurion and, on the Israeli’s part at least,the animosity developed into a fierce hatred of Kennedy. On June 16th 1963Ben-Gurion resigned as prime minister and defence minister. While other officialreasons were offered for his decision, behind the scenes he believed thatKennedy’s even-handed policy in the Middle East threatened the very existence ofhis beloved Israel. He could not change Kennedy’s mind and so he wished someoneelse to try. In one of his last exchanges with Kennedy, he said: “Mr. President,my people have a right to exist…and that existence is in danger”.15 According tothe research of Michael Collins Piper in Final Judgement:> “…in his final days as prime minster, (Ben-Gurion) ordered Israel’s Mossad to> orchestrate the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Based upon additional> evidence uncovered, we believe that Mossad took the necessary steps and> achieved that goal.” 16Mossad certainly had many close connections with others who wished to see an endto Kennedy, especially the CIA and Meyer Lansky. Kennedy had both of those inhis sights also. While Kennedy had accepted campaign money from Lansky and theMafia, he really wanted to destroy them. Once in office he appointed his brotherBobby as attorney general and he began a massive drive against the organisedcrime syndicate. Lansky and the Mafia were outraged at what they saw as a doublecross. With his close ties to the CIA and Mossad, Lansky had previously beenuntouchable, but now he and his international operation were under threat.Kennedy also realised that the CIA was out of control and operating its ownagenda. It had set him up for tremendous criticism in the Bay of Pigs disaster,the failed attempt to remove Castro from Cuba. Lansky’s crime network was alsoinvolved in that because their casino and prostitution rackets in Cuba weredestroyed by the arrival of Castro. Kennedy sacked Allen Dulles, the head of theCIA and funder of Adolf Hitler, and pledged to “splinter the CIA in a thousandpieces and scatter it to the winds”.17 The CIA, like Lansky and the Israelilobby, knew that the survival of their power structure was threatened by Johnand Bobby Kennedy. Any one of these groups had the power and organisation tohave Kennedy removed and here he was taking on all three.More than that, he had decided to withdraw the United States from the VietnamWar, much to the dismay of Lansky, Mossad, and the CIA who were using theconflict as a cover for their drug running operations in South East Asia, and toIsrael who believed that while the attention of the US was concentrated onVietnam, it could not keep a close eye on what was happening in the Middle East.The arms manufacturers and global banks also wanted the war to continue, ofcourse. And there was yet another reason why Kennedy was deeply unpopular withthe Global Elite as his presidential policies became clear. He wished to destroythe power of the Federal Reserve Board by issuing interest-free money. In facthe had already made a start with that before his death and some of hisinterest-free notes are still in circulation today. This was the Elite’s worstnightmare. The last president to issue interest-free money had been AbrahamLincoln and look what happened to him. The forces ranged against Kennedy by 1963were simply enormous. Indeed, when you look behind the façades, they were allthe same organisation controlled by the few. This will become clear as we lookat the organisations working together to assassinate John F. Kennedy (Figure 14overleaf).Israel, Mossad, and the Anti-Defamation LeagueIsrael is not a home for Jewish people. Let us not mince words here. The timefor pussyfooting around is over. Israel is a base for the terrorists who createdand control that state to operate, on behalf of the House of Rothschild and theElite, a global terror and manipulation network. That is why it was createdafter the war and the influence of its intelligence arm, Mossad, is so vast forsuch a tiny country because Mossad is really the intelligence agency of theRothschild-Rockefeller-Global Elite, while genuine Jewish people who live inIsrael (the vast, vast majority) are used as an innocent front, a smokescreen,for this. So, too, is the suffering of Jews in Nazi Germany which resulted fromthe manipulating of the Nazis into power by, among others, ‘Jewish’ financialand political forces. The way Jewish people have been stitched up isastonishing. It is no good some writers condemning the whole thing as a Jewishplot. It is not. The mass of Jewish people are victims, not perpetrators of theevents I describe. It is those who control Israel who are among those behind theplot, not Jewish people, as at least some brave rabbis and other Jews have hadthe guts to point out.[../Images/00009.jpg]Figure 14Mossad, like the State of Israel itself, was created by groups such as the SternGang and others, which terrorised Palestine out of existence after the war,under the financial and political direction of the House of Rothschild. LordVictor Rothschild, the former British intelligence officer and KGB spy, was atthe forefront of this. According to Simon Schama’s book, Two Rothschilds And TheLand Of Israel (Collins, London, 1978), the House of Rothschild had acquired 80%of the land of Israel. They also paid the expenses of the early settlers,manipulated into being the 1917 Balfour Declaration which recognised Israel as aJewish homeland, funded the Nazis and created Mossad and the terroristunderground in Palestine. Israel was founded by, and has always been controlledby, the Rothschilds and the rest of the Elite. The “Jewish homeland” scam isjust a smokescreen and Jewish people are pawns in the game. The leaders andparticipants in this terror network later became leaders and prime ministers ofthe new Israel. People like David Ben-Gurion, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, andYitzhak Shamir, the head of the Mossad assassination squad at the time ofKennedy’s murder. The Anti-Defamation League is a Mossad (Rothschild) front inthe United States and further afield. As we have seen, it evolved from anorganisation set up before the First World War to brand as “anti-Semitic” theNew York police commissioner who was determined to destroy the mobsters. To thisday the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) works, mostly covertly, to condemn as“anti-Semitic” anyone getting close to the truth. The former Mossad agent,Victor Ostrovsky, has confirmed all this in his books, By Way Of Deception andThe Other Side Of Deception, which massively expose the extent of Mossad’sworld-wide operations and what he calls the “Judeo-Nazis” who control Israel andthe Mossad. The ADL has tremendous influence, even control, of the mainstreammedia via other parts of the Elite network. As with Mossad, it prefers to useother people and organisations as fronts for its activities, so no-one knowswhere the motivation for stories, attacks, and assassinations is really comingfrom. Mossad (“The Institution for Intelligence and Special Tasks”) has a geniusfor diverting attention from its own responsibility by producing “patsies” totake the blame – “false flags” as they are called in intelligence parlance. TheADL, which is part of B’nai B’rith, is based at United Nations Plaza, New York.B’nai B’rith means “Sons of the Alliance” and was established in 1843. Many ofits speakers openly supported slavery during the American Civil War and itcovertly supports and controls the Ku Klux Klan. Today this same B’nai B’rithseeks to label leading blacks as “anti-Semitic” and racist!18The Meyer Lansky Crime SyndicateMeyer Lansky was devoted to Israel and therefore the Rothschilds. His networkplayed a crucial role in supplying guns and funds to the terror groups of Rabin,Begin, Ben-Gurion, Shamir, and others, as they shot and bombed the State ofIsrael into being. He then became a major supplier of the same to Israel.Lansky, Mossad, the Anti-Defamation League, and Israel were as one. MorrisDalitz, an intimate of Lansky in his gangster network, was given theAnti-Defamation League’s annual Torch of Liberty award. His terror activitieswere not deemed as important as his contributions to Israel and the ADL. Indeed,his terror activities on behalf of the ADL may well have swung the voting.Whenever the heat was on in the United States, Lansky would run to Israel and heeventually settled there. Lansky (Israel) was trailing John Kennedy for a longtime and, of course, Lansky hated the Kennedy family because of his conflictwith Father Joe. It was a Lansky henchman on the West Coast called Mickey Cohenwho was behind the introduction of Kennedy to the film star, Marilyn Monroe,after which they began a now much publicised relationship. The vehicle for thismeeting was Cohen’s close friend, the entertainer Joey Bishop, who was a memberof the Frank Sinatra clique known as “The Rat Pack”. The idea was to use Monroeto pump Kennedy for information about his attitute to Israel, should he becomepresident. She was, of course, later murdered, although it was made to look like“suicide”. Those who killed her also killed Kennedy. Mickey Cohen was Lanksy’sman in Hollywood where the film industry had long been a propaganda machine forthe Elite’s agenda and version of ‘history’. It still is today, only the nameshave changed. Cohen also specialised in compromising screen stars sexually andthen blackmailing them. Nice man. He was another financer and politicalmanipulator on behalf of the Jewish terror groups and the State of Israel.Still, I’m sure “God” would have approved. One of Cohen’s close associateswas…Menachim Begin, then head of the terrorist group, Irgun. Jimmy “the Weasel”Fratianno, a leader of the West Coast Mafia, told of a meeting he attended inBel Air to raise money for Begin’s terrorists:> “After (Cohen’s) little speech, we start moving around the room and Mickey’s> rabbi introduces us to a guy called Menachim Begin, who’s the boss of Irgun,> an underground outfit in Palestine. This guy’s wearing a black armband and he> tells us he’s wanted back there for bombing a hotel that killed almost a> hundred people. He’s a fucking lamster (on the run).” 19Begin, as Prime Minister of Israel, later won the Nobel Peace Prize! Gary Wean,a detective sergeant in the Los Angeles Police Department, had the job ofmonitoring Cohen’s activities. In his book, There’s A Fish In The Courthouse,Wean confirms the story about Marilyn Monroe and the Cohen-Begin connection:> “At the time the rabbis were pushing them hard as hell to squeeze every bit of> dough they could get out of Hollywood for Israel. Begin was spending more time> hanging around Cohen in Hollywood than in Israel. Begin desperately wanted to> know what Kennedy’s plan was for Israel if he became president.” 20Another of Cohen’s associates and a leading errand boy and operative for MeyerLansky was Jack Rubinstein. He’s better known today as…Jack Ruby, the man whokilled the Kennedy “patsy”, Lee Harvey Oswald.The CIAThe connections between the CIA, the organised crime syndicates, and Mossad areendless, not least with the global drug running operations in which the three ofthem cooperate. During the war the Americans used Meyer Lansky and the Mafia ina plan known as Operation Underworld and it is common knowledge that they werealso used in plots to remove Fidel Castro in Cuba, an operation in which JackRuby also played a part. The Global Elite elements within the CIA and the GlobalElite’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Mossad, are the same organisation. Before,during, and after the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy, the keycoordinator of these connections was one James Jesus Angleton, who was educatedin his early years in England at Chartridge Hall House in Buckinghamshire andMalvern House in Worcestershire. He was recruited by the CIA’s predecessor, theOffice of Strategic Services (OSS), after leaving the Skull and Bones universityof Yale. In 1947, he joined the new CIA and progressed to the highly sensitiveand pivotal post of head of CIA counter-intelligence. According to hisbiographer, Tom Mangold, his major patrons were Allen Dulles, the CIA directorfired by Kennedy, and Richard Helms, who was appointed CIA director by Lyndon B.Johnson after Kennedy’s assassination. Mangold says that, in effect, Angletonwas given such a free reign to pursue his own agenda that there was virtually nomonitoring or control of his activities. He was a law unto himself. This becomesvery significant to the story when we realise that one of Angleton’s key roleswas the official CIA liason with Allied foreign intelligenceagencies…particularly with Mossad (Rothschilds). He was the head of the CIA’sIsrael desk! More than that he had long and intimate ties with David Ben-Gurion,the Israeli Prime Minister, who despised Kennedy and saw him as a threat to theexistence of Israel. Kennedy’s war with the CIA also threatened the existence ofAngleton’s job and power base. Angleton had many reasons to want Kennedy out ofthe way, but the most important was his connection to, and likely control by,Israel, which then, as now, controls much of the CIA operation. Wilbur CraneEveland, a former advisor to the CIA and member of the policy-planning staff atthe White House and Pentagon, said:> “Stemming from his wartime OSS liaison with Jewish resistance groups based in> London, James Angleton had arranged an operational-intelligence exchange> agreement with Israel’s Mossad, upon which the CIA relied for much of its> intelligence about the Arab states.” 21> > My goodness, I bet those intelligence reports were unbiased!Lord Victor RothschildThere is also the British connection to consider here. While working in Londonfor the OSS, James Angleton became a close friend of the spy, Kim Philby, andworked with Lord Victor Rothschild, the “fifth man” in the spy network ofPhilby, Burgess, Maclean, and Blunt. Lord Rothschild, the friend of WinstonChurchill, was in fact far more than the “fifth man”. He was the string pullerof British Intelligence, a controller of, and agent for, Mossad,22 and adedicated manipulator for the House of Rothschild and the Global Elite. WhenAngleton was posted to Rome in 1944 by the OSS, it was Rothschild who gave himcontacts in the Jewish underground there.23 Angleton was also a friend of theBritish Intelligence operative, Peter Wright, the man behind the books, TheirTrade Is Treachery and Spycatcher, which were suggested and organised by LordRothschild. The books named the former MI5 chief, Sir Roger Hollis, as the“fifth man”, so diverting attention from Rothschild. Wright’s contention thatHollis was the Soviet spy was supported by Angleton on Rothschild’s behalf.Angleton was in Rothschild’s debt for earlier favours and support. The British(Rothschild) connection to Angleton and the CIA/Mossad clique was fundamental.It was Rothschild who had powerful connections with all the parties involved,British Intelligence, Mossad, the CIA with it’s head of counter-intelligenceJames Jesus Angleton, and other contracts at the highest Elite levels in theUnited States.Crucially, it was Lord Victor Rothschild who masterminded the Israeli nuclearweapons programme which Kennedy wished to stop. Within months of Israel’sformation, Rothschild and his close friend, Chaim Weizmann, set up a specialnuclear physics department at Rehovoth. It was named after Weizmann, the head ofBritish Zionism and the first president of the new Israel. Weizmann had alsobeen a key manipulator behind the Balfour Declaration, the letter sent byBritish Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Victor Rothschild’s uncle, Walter,in 1917, confirming British support for a Jewish state in Palestine. VictorRothschild covertly gathered information for the nuclear scientists at theWeizmann Institute from researchers and experts all over the world, includingAlbert Einstein, members of the British Atomic Scientists Association, and themathmatician and philosopher, Bertrand Russell, who, with Einstein, helped tocreate the Pugwash Conferences on nuclear weapons.24 Roland Perry writes in hisbook The Fifth Man:> “The dream of an Israeli bomb was ambitious indeed, but it spurred Rothschild> to keep abreast of all things nuclear so he could pass on data to the Weizmann> Institute, which was planning a nuclear reactor at Dimona in the Negev Desert.> Under a modified guise of concern about the spread and dangers of nuclear> weapons, he was able to keep contact with appropriate scientists around the> world.” 25In this way, Rothschild had access to the Manhattan Project which led to theatomic attack on Japan, and he was an associate of Klaus Fuchs, the Germanphysicist who was later jailed for giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union.Rothschild, who did the same, got away with it. His leading role, with money andinformation, in the creation of the Israeli nuclear weapon was publicly rewardedin 1962 when Rothschild was made an Honorary Fellow of the Weizmann Institute.Shimon Peres, who became Prime Minister of Israel following the murder ofYitzhak Rabin in 1995, worked with Rothschild to persuade the French to buildthe nuclear facility at Dimona. The French wing of the House of Rothschild wouldhave had enormous influence on the French Government. Peres, then director ofthe Defence Ministry, promised in return to support the French and British intheir efforts to retake the Suez Canal from Egypt’s President Nassar, somethingIsrael wanted to happen anyway!26 Peres and Asher Ben-Natan, a Mossad agent atthe Defence Ministry, signed a top secret agreement with the French and herprime minister, Bourges Maunoury.27 Roland Perry writes:> “In it, the French promised to supply a powerful 24 megawatt reactor, the> technical know-how to run it, and some uranium. The secret deal was only known> to about a dozen individuals, including Rothschild, and with good reason. The> fine print of the document allowed for the inclusion of equipment which would> permit the Israelis to produce weapons-grade nuclear fuel.> “In 1957, French engineers began building the two-storey reactor facility at> Dimona on the edge of the Negev Desert, which secretly went down six levels> below ground. The subterranean construction would be the place where nuclear> weapons would be built.” 28This was the nuclear programme, the very creation of Rothschild, which PresidentKennedy wanted to end. So here was Lord Victor Rothschild (the man behind theuse of Regulation 18b to jail people without trial for exposing the Second WorldWar as a scam) with a stream of reasons to want Kennedy out of the way. He wasalso closely connected to all the people and organisations which assassinatedthe president. At the time of Kennedy’s death, Rothschild was working for ShellOil, but this post was a front for his covert manipulation and wheeler-dealingwithin British intelligence on behalf of the Elite. The House of Rothschild wasdeeply involved in the Kennedy assassination, of that I have no doubt.PermindexThis company was a central part of the coordination between Mossad, the CIA, andthe Lansky Syndicate. Serving on its board was Clay Shaw, the CIA operativeindicted for Kennedy’s murder by New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison, ashighlighted in the film, JFK. It was because Shaw was linked to Permindex, thepivotal vehicle in the whole plot, that so much dirt was thrown at Garrison.Shaw was also managing director of International Trade Mart and on the board ofthat company was Edgar Stern Jr, whose parents were leading financial supportersof the US Israeli lobby.29 The Sterns were among Shaw’s closest friends and hewas also connected to the Lansky syndicate.Permindex (short for Permanent Industrial Expositions) was a subsidiary of acompany called CMC, founded in 1961 by an Eastern European Jew, Georges Mandel,who called himself Giorgio Mantello. Its cover operation, like that ofPermindex, was presenting business exhibitions. One of its chief shareholderswas the Banque De Credit International (BCI) based in the Elite stronghold ofGeneva. This bank was established by Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, the longtimedirector of finance and supply for Mossad.30 Rosenbaum was also an internationalvice-president of the World Jewish Congress, a co-founder of the World ZionistCongress, and a director of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, successor to thePalestine Liberation office, a coordinator of Jewish terrorism against the Arabsand the British in Palestine. The newspaper, Ha’aretz, once declared that “TiborRosenbaum is Israel”. He worked closely with the Rothschilds (including LordVictor for sure) and together with Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the Frencharistocrat, he set up the Israel Corporation which sought money abroad forIsrael’s development projects, so allowing her tax money to be spent on fundingthe military.31Among the names that Rosenbaum sponsored was the ‘financier’ and Lansky drugmoney-launderer, Bernie Cornfield.32 It was through Rosenbaum’s bank that theLansky Syndicate laundered most of its money in Europe. So did Mossad and theCIA.33 The chairman of Permindex was Major Louis M. Bloomfield, a devotedsupporter of Israel. Permindex was based in his home city of Montreal, Canada,before being relocated to Rome, where the CIA’s James Angleton had endlessintelligence and underworld connections. Bloomfield was involved in OperationUnderworld, the joint American intelligence operation with Lansky and the Mafia,while he served with Britain’s counter-intelligence elite during the war, theSpecial Operations Executive (SOE). Operation Underworld was run from theRockefeller Center in New York. Bloomfield’s boss was Sir William Stephenson,who set up British intelligence operations in the United States before the warand was also connected with Lansky, Mossad, and the Rockefellers.34 Stephensonis said to have been the character on which James Bond is based. OperationUnderworld later became a centre for gun-running operations to the Jewishterrorist underground in which Stephenson, Bloomfield and Victor Rothschildplayed crucial parts. Working with Bloomfield in this were Meyer Lansky andSamuel Bronfman of the Canadian underworld family.It was a company set up by William Stephenson’s Special Operations Executivethat we know today as the Hollinger Group, controlled by the Canadian andleading Bilderberger, Conrad Black, the owner of the global media empire whichincludes the London Telegraph Newspapers and The Jerusalem Post. On the board ofthe Hollinger Group are a stream of Bilderbergers and CFR/TC members, includingHenry Kissinger and Lord Carrington. This is even more interesting when youthink that the Permindex chairman and SOE operative, Louis Bloomfield, wasreally a frontman and attorney for the Canadian Bronfman family, who made theirfortune from running booze during prohibition and from general gangsteractivities. The Bronfman gang were close to Conrad Black’s father, another boozemerchant and intelligence operative with the SOE, and the Bronfman’s are longterm financial supporters and members of the Mossad front, the Anti-DefamationLeague.Bloomfield first met Clay Shaw during the latter’s service with the Office ofStrategic Services (OSS) during the war, an organisation to which Bloomfield wasalso assigned. Shaw was based in London and became a friend of Prime Minister,Winston Churchill (Comm 300), whose personal advisor was…Sir William Stephenson.Also serving with the OSS in London at this time was James Jesus Angleton, theCIA’s head of counter-intelligence and the Israel desk when Kennedy was killed.And who was the man controlling British Intelligence at this same period? LordVictor Rothschild, another close friend of Churchill, the man behind Israel’snuclear weapons project and one of the key people behind the creation of Israel.Rothschild knew Shaw, Bloomfield, Stephenson, and Angleton, who were all part ofthe team which conspired to kill Kennedy. Either directly, or through thisgroup, Rothschild would have known, or had the means to communicate with, MeyerLansky. Rothschild’s connections with Mossad and Israel were fundamental. He wasat the heart of the Jewish terror and intelligence groups which brought Israelinto existence. One of these intelligence groups, the Hananah or Hananah “B”,the terrorist wing, became what we know as Mossad.35 The Rothschilds’ own “inhouse” intelligence agency, which had been operating since the early days of theRothschild dynasty, also fused with Mossad.Bloomfield and Shaw came together again on the board of Permindex and workedtogether on its cover operation, the setting up of trade exhibitions around theworld. On November 22nd 1963, President Kennedy was on his way to speak at thenewly created Dallas Trade Mart when he was assassinated. It was thatappointment at the trade mart which led his motorcade to pass through DealeyPlaza where the fatal shots were fired. A coincidence? I don’t think so,somehow.French IntelligenceThe death of President Kennedy and the many attempts on the life of the FrenchPresident, General Charles DeGaulle, were orchestrated by the same organisation– the Rothschild-controlled, Mossad. One of the assassination attempts onDeGaulle was immortalised by the Frederick Forsyth ‘novel’, The Day Of TheJackal. Interestingly, in this same period there was a terrorist group known asthe Jewish Anti-Communist League or JACL,36 and this group cooperated with arenegade “cell” within French Intelligence called the OAS.The Israeli-CIA backed OAS was the group directly behind the attempts onDeGaulle’s life. They opposed him for what they saw as his betrayal of France ingiving independence to Algeria. Also opposed to this were Israel and Mossad, andthe issue was one of the many conflicts they had with Kennedy, who supportedAlgerian independence as a young senator. Once again the endless connectionsunfold. During World War II, the CIA’s head of the Israeli desk, James JesusAngleton, served as American intelligence liason with French Intelligence, theSDECE, and maintained many contacts with their operatives who shared his love ofIsrael. He also had strong connections with the Corsican Mafia in France whichworked with the Lansky Syndicate. Drugs produced in the laboratories ofMarseille by the Corsican Mafia were transferred to the streets of America byLansky and Angleton’s CIA. Israel and Mossad rarely do their dirty workthemselves, nor the CIA come to that, and a former French Intelligence agent anddiplomat told Michael Collins Piper, the author of Final Judgement, that Mossadused a French team to assassinate Kennedy:> “Even the CIA contract the services of the intelligence community (they like> the French style) to wash dirty linens. The right hand does not know what the> left did. The cover-up team doesn’t know who execute. And the executioners are> not interested in the aftermath of their mission. They don’t care less.” 37The intelligence officer said that Yitzhak Shamir, the then head of the Mossadassassination unit and later Israeli Prime Minister, arranged for the Frenchteam to kill Kennedy in collaboration with Colonel Georges deLannurien, thedeputy head of French Intelligence. As Collins’ informant said:> “It was no coincidence that on the very day of the execution of the president> by the French team, that (deLannurien) was at Langley (CIA headquarters)> meeting with James Jesus Angleton, the Mossad mole.” 38Funny how Shamir doesn’t mention any of this in his ‘autobiography’, Summing Up.In that he says that Mossad stood for “honesty” and “moral standards”.39 No I’mnot kidding. Shamir also says that he heard of the Kennedy assassination with“stunned disbelief” and somehow knew that everything would now be different.40Ahem, excuse me Yitzhak, but wasn’t that the whole idea?New OrleansThe City of New Orleans was important in the plot. From there a man called GuyBannister, a former FBI and Naval Intelligence operative, ran a ‘detectiveagency’, a cover story for it’s CIA intelligence work. According to the formerCIA contract agent, Robert Morrow, who was close to the New Orleans operation,the immediate CIA superior of Bannister was…Clay Shaw, the Permindex director,and the only man to face trial for the murder of Kennedy, a charge he survivedthanks to the murder and intimidation of key witnesses. One of Bannister’s closefriends was A.I. Bosnick, a leading figure in the New Orleans office of theMossad-front, the Anti-Defamation League. Bannister’s office at 544 Camp Streetin New Orleans was also an informal branch of the renegade French intelligencecell, the OAS, which provided the actual assassins for Mossad and the CIA inDallas. An OAS representative working out of Camp Street was the mercenary, JeanSouetre, who had ties with Meyer Lansky’s allies in the Corsican Mafia. A CIAdocument discovered in 1977 by Dallas researcher, Mary Ferrell, revealed thatFrench intelligence were trying to locate Souetre, an OAS terrorist, because hewas considered a threat to the life of Charles DeGaulle. The document, datedApril 1st 1964, listed some known sightings of Souetre. It said that he was inFort Worth on the morning of November 22nd 1963 (so was Kennedy) and that he wasalso in Dallas that same afternoon when Kennedy was shot. Within 48 hours of theassassination, the document said, Souetre was picked up in Texas and expelledfrom the United States.41 Souetre said that the man referred to in the documentwas really another French assassin called Michel Mertz who, he claimed, used hisname.It was through Bannister’s office that Lee Harvey Oswald, himself a CIA asset,was unknowingly set up as the patsy. He was given a false story and told to poseas a pro-Castro communist by the CIA without realising why. It seems that plan Awas to persuade the public that Oswald killed Kennedy out of support for Castro.It is possible that Oswald was funded by the Anti-Defamation League. Certainlythe plan to give Oswald a pro-Castro public personna was supported by theADL-controlled media. The NBC television and radio affiliate in New Orleans,WDSU, interviewed Oswald about his “pro-communist, pro-Castro” views in August1963 and then turned the tape over to the FBI. They also invited him to a debateabout Castro and filmed him handing out pro-Castro leaflets in Dallas. Why somuch airtime for Oswald in the months leading up to the Kennedy assassination?Maybe the fact that WDSU was owned by the Stern family, very close friends ofClay Shaw, and major contributers to Israel and the Anti-Defamation League,would answer that question. After the assassination, the WDSU interviews withOswald were immediately broadcast nationally by NBC, so providing support forthe idea that Oswald was a “lone nut” who killed Kennedy in support of Castro.(Johann Rush, the young camerman who took the film of Oswald handing out theleaflets, emerged 30 years later as the “expert” whose “enhancement” of theZapruder film was supposed to have “proved” that Oswald was the loneassassin!)42The StingIt appears from the excellent research in Final Judgement that Dallas and DealeyPlaza was full of different people and groups who, after the event, could belinked by investigators to the assassination. This was done to provide so manypossible assassins and senarios for investigators that the waters would beseriously muddied. It is a classic diversion tactic. Only a tiny few at thescene, the assassins in the Mossad-CIA-OAS ZR-Rifle Team, knew that the plan wasto kill Kennedy. The others were there for other reasons and among these groups,it seems, was a CIA team who believed the plan was to fake an assassinationattempt on the president. The idea, they believed, was to blame the attempt onCastro and cause so much outrage in America that Kennedy would drop his plan tomake some kind of peace with Cuba or, ideally, he might even be pressured tolaunch an invasion and remove Castro. It is probable that the CIA’s E. HowardHunt, with his connections to the Bay of Pigs disaster and the anti-Castro Cubanresistence groups, was one of this CIA “fake assassination” team, possibly itsleader. If the story is true, no-one would have been more surprised than Huntand his colleagues when Kennedy was actually shot and Hunt’s CIA team almostcertainly included one Lee Harvey Oswald. This is the mission Oswald would havebeen told he was assigned to before he began to promote himself so publicly as apro-Castro communist when he was nothing of the kind. The story about the CIA“fake” team in Dallas was told to Gary Wean, formerly of the Los Angeles Policecriminal intelligence squad. Wean met his informant through the Dallas Sheriff,Bill Decker, who had said:> “There’s a man in Dallas I’ve known for a long time. He knows the entire truth> about Oswald’s involvement. He’s scared to death to go to the Dallas Police> Department or FBI. There has been a terrible double cross somewhere and> everybody is scared shitless of everybody else.> “You wouldn’t believe the crazy suspicions and accusations heaped on all law> enforcement in the South by imbeciles in D.C. and the chaos it has created.”> 43Later Wean met with Decker’s informant and he referred to him only as “John”.Wean was told that E. Howard Hunt (who would later be one of the Watergateburglers) had informed Oswald that Kennedy himself was not aware of the fakeassassination plan, but high-ranking cabinet officers did know about it. Oswaldwas told that he would flee the country after the fake ‘assassination’, but hewould be allowed to return once Castro had been dealt with.44 So Oswald thoughtthe assassination was designed purposely to fail and he certainly realisedimmediately after Kennedy was killed that he had been set up to take the blame.Intelligence agencies do not operate as one entity, they usecompartmentalisation to ensure that different elements have no idea what theothers are doing. Gary Wean did not reveal the identity of “John” for obviousreasons, but after 1991 he was safe to do so. “John” was Senator John Tower, whoin 1961, had become the first Republican this century to win a senate seat inTexas. Tower was a strong supporter and ally of the CIA throughout his careerand would later help to cover up George Bush’s fundamental involvement in theIran-Contra arms-for-drugs scandal. On April 5th 1991, John Tower died when hisplane exploded.The Cover UpThe cover up began from the moment the fatal shots were fired, indeed the coverstories were arranged well before. Oswald was presented across the world as alone assassin who did it for Castro and Cuba. Oswald, however, said after hisarrest that he had been set up. He wasn’t going to go quietly, so he had to gophysically. Step forward Jack Ruby (Rubenstein), who shot Oswald at point-blankrange as police “escorted” him through a public place after his arrest. Ruby wasportrayed as a Dallas night club owner who killed Oswald to avenge Kennedy’sdeath. Er, I don’t think so, somehow. Ruby’s first phone call after his arrestwas to Al Gruber, a close associate of Mickey Cohen, the Meyer Lansky henchmanin Hollywood. It was Cohen who worked with Menachim Begin to set up the JohnKennedy-Marilyn Monroe connection which ended in the film star’s murder by thesame crowd. Gruber had arrived in Dallas shortly before the Kennedyassassination to visit Ruby, a man he hadn’t seen for ten years.45 Ruby’s lawyerat his trial was Melvin Belli, the friend and attorney of Mickey Cohen.46 Atleast one meeting has been confirmed between Belli, Cohen, and Begin.47Jack Ruby worked for Al Capone and spent most of his life operating within theorganised crime syndicate, especially for it’s boss of bosses, Meyer Lanksy.Ruby has been portrayed as a Mafia man to divert attention from his realemployer – Lansky. His association with Lansky led to Ruby’s connections withthe CIA, Israel, and the anti-Castro groups. Marita Lorenz, a former CIAoperative, said at a libel hearing involving E. Howard Hunt of the CIA and TheSpotlight newspaper, that the day before Kennedy’s assassination she met inDallas with Hunt and a group of other CIA operatives including…Jack Ruby. Hunt,she said, was the paymaster for a top secret operation, the purpose of which shehad no idea. She was told that her part was to act as a “decoy”.48 Instead sheleft Dallas and didn’t take part. It seems likely that Ruby, like Oswald,eventually realised that he had been set up. His family fired his lawyer, MelvinBelli, after Ruby was convicted and sentenced to death. But before his appealcould be heard, Ruby conveniently died in jail.49 Ruby’s demise, or at leastdisappearance, came after he made it clear he had some very important things tosay about Kennedy’s death. He asked Earl Warren, the head of the commissioninvestigating the assassination, to be transferred for his own safety fromDallas to Washington to tell his story. Warren refused and the story was nevertold. I wonder why?In the light of what you have read in this book and in particular in the lastfew pages, let us look at the make up of the Warren Commission which decidedthat yes indeed Lee Harvey Oswald had worked alone. The Warren Commission wasappointed by Lyndon Baines Johnson, the man who became president as a result ofKennedy’s death. If you apply the question of: Who benefits? to the Kennedyassassination then Johnson is high on the list. What’s more, he was closelyconnected to all the other players who benefited massively from the killing.Johnson had longtime connections with Meyer Lansky and had been taking bribesfrom the syndicate in return for political favours since he became a TexasSenator. Johnson, as Final Judgement makes clear, was a megacrook and only byusing the Elite networks did he avoid going to jail for a very long time. WhenJohnson replaced Kennedy, the adminstration’s war on organised crime wasimmediately disbanded. Johnson was also a favourite and keen supporter ofIsrael. Again, after Kennedy was gone, Johnson quickly reversed America’sneutral policy in the Middle East to one of virtually unlimited financial andpolitical support for Israel. Researcher and author Stephen Green wrote of theJohnson period in his study of America-Israel policy:> “…during this time US financial support for Israel far exceeded that given any> other nation in the world, on a per capita basis. And US diplomatic support> for Israel in the UN and elsewhere was no less generous.” 50Johnson also reversed Kennedy’s policy of withdrawing from Vietnam and that warescalated to the enormous benefit of the Lansky-CIA-Mossad drugs operation inSouth East Asia and the coffers of the arms manufacturers and bankers. Johnsonquickly halted the Kennedy plan to issue interest-free money and curtail thepower of the Federal Reserve banking cartel. Lyndon Johnson, yet another crookto occupy the White House, gave all the participants in Kennedy’s murdereverything they asked for after becoming president in the wake of JFK’s death.Johnson was the man whose very survival depended on the truth about theassassination (and his own involvement) never being publicly known. This was thesame man who appointed the Warren Commission to establish the killer!

He hated Kennedy, who planned to remove him after the 1964 election.Hoover was connected to both Meyer Lansky and the Anti-Defamation League.Michael Milan, a former Lansky associate and undercover FBI operative, said: “Ialso knew that (J. Edgar Hoover) and Meyer Lansky sometimes broke breadtogether. Mr L. was never rousted, was rarely served with federal subpoenas, andwas generally left alone to conduct business”.52 Hoover had very close linkswith the Mossad-front, the Anti-Defamation League. In 1947 a foundation was setup in his name thanks to money from the ADL. The Hoover Foundation’s firstpresident was Rabbi Paul Richman, Washington director of the ADL.53 Hoover wasalso a close friend of Louis Bloomfield, the head of the Mossad assassinationfront, Permindex!These, then, were the men who decided that Oswald was the lone killer! More thanthat, the CIA department given responsibility for dealing with the WarrenCommission ‘investigation’ was the counter-intelligence department controlledby…James Jesus Angleton, the Mossad mole and a prime organiser of theassassination. The FBI-Warren Commission coordinator was William Sullivan, aclose friend of…James Jesus Angleton.The cover up has continued to this day with books and magazines funded by theassassins and their successors claiming that the Mafia, Castro, the KGB, etc.etc. killed Kennedy. Each one is designed to further obscure the real culprits,the Israel-CIA-Meyer Lansky-OAS network operating together under a centralcommand, probably the House of Rothschild. Do you think the media is notcontrolled enough to keep the truth from the public for more than thirty years?As the former Mossad agent, Victor Ostrovsky says:> “(I realised) that the occupation of the North American media is complete. In> subjects dealing with the Middle East in general and Israel in particular,> there is no longer a free press…I had always known there was a double standard> when it came to dealing with subjects that were dear to the Jewish community.> I had not known, however, how hypocritical that community and the media that> lie at its feet can be. I had known that it had all but taken over the film> industry and has a strong grip on Washington…Now through intimidation and> double dealing, it obviously has taken over large portions of the American> media. To all those who knew this all along, and were silent, and to those who> remain silent now – shame on you.” 54The editor of Life magazine, Richard Billings, ran a vehement campaign todiscredit Jim Garrison’s investigations into the assassination, as Garrison hasdocumented. Billings would later serve on the staff of the House AssassinationsCommittee, alongside it’s director, G. Robert Blakey, an associate of MeyerLansky’s friend, Morris Dalitz. The committee decided the “Mafia did it”. TheTime-Life organisation later merged with Warner to create the Time-Warner mediaempire. This is an Elite-controlled organisation which now owns Turnerbroadcasting and its global ‘news’ channel, CNN. Warner Brothers was absorbed bya company called Seven Arts set up by a Meyer Lansky operative, Louis Chesler,and used to launder syndicate money. When Seven Arts won control of WarnerStudios, major blocks of shares in the company were owned by the InvestorsOverseas Service of Bernie Cornfield, the frontman for the Rothschilds andMossad’s Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, the funder of Permindex. In 1993, the Bronfman’s(the gangster family who controlled the Permindex chief, Louis M. Bloomfield)bought a controlling interest in Time-Warner. How facinating, then, that OliverStone’s ‘exposé’ of the Kennedy Assassination, JFK, was distributed by WarnerBrothers. Stone’s film, a mixture of fact and fiction, blamed themilitary-industrial complex and the CIA and not the real conspirators, Mossad.Stone has since done a similar diversion job on Richard Nixon. The executiveproducer of JFK, the man responsible for finding the money for the film, wasArnon Milchan, who was identified as a major arms supplier and undercoveroperative for Israel. Journalist Alexander Cockburn wrote in The Nation on May18th 1992 that Milchan “was identified in one 1989 Israeli report as ‘probably’(Israel’s) largest arms dealer. A company he once owned was caught smugglingnuclear weapons fuses to Iraq”. The public relations company hired by Stone tohandle publicity for the JFK film was Hill and Knowlton in Washington D.C., thefirm which coordinated the propaganda supporting America’s involvement in theGulf War. The Hill and Knowlton executive who headed the JFK publicity was FrankMankiewicz, who began his career with the Anti-Defamation League in Los Angeles.To this day, the Kennedy assassination continues to stink.John Kennedy realised from his experiences before and after he became presidentthat a Hidden Hand controlled the United States. Ten days before his death, hesaid at Colombia University:> “The high office of President has been used to foment a plot against the> American people. Before I leave office, I must inform the citizen of his> plight.” 55> > Unfortunately, he never had the chance to do that.In his book, Defrauding America, Rodney Stich also reveals further evidence ofCIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination and its cover-up. Stich, a formerfederal inspector, uses his own knowledge, experience, and informants fromwithin the intelligence network, to reveal the web of interconnected corruptionthroughout the US government. One of his contacts was Colonel Trenton Parker, aformer high level CIA operative, who was connected with the agency’scounter-intelligence unit known as Pegasus. Parker said that the Pegasus grouphad tape recordings of people planning the Kennedy assassination. He named themas “Rockefeller (which one, I wonder), Allen Dulles, Johnson of Texas, GeorgeBush and J. Edgar Hoover”. Parker went on:> “I don’t have the tapes now, because all the tape recordings were turned over> to [Congressman] Larry McDonald. But I listened to the tape recordings and> there were conversations between Rockefeller and Hoover, where Rockefeller> asks: ‘Are we going to have any problems? I checked with Dulles. If they do> their job, we’ll do our job.’ There are a whole bunch of tapes, because Hoover> didn’t realise that his phone had been tapped.”Parker said that the Pegasus group had also given files to Congressman McDonaldabout CIA criminal activities between 1976 and 1982. McDonald, a member of theJoint Armed Services Committee, let it be known that he was going to revealstartling evidence about CIA and government corruption when he returned from atrip to the Far East. But he did not return. He was on the Korean Airlinesflight 007 shot down by the ‘Soviet Union’. The plane’s flight computer wasreprogrammed to divert the aircraft into Russian airspace and they were waitingto shoot it down.56 Two ‘sides’ – same masters.Bobby KennedyJFK’s death triggered a spate of political assassinations in the United Statesduring the 1960s as the New World Order imposed itself. His brother BobbyKennedy, the attorney general who led the challenge to the Lansky syndicate, wasmurdered in 1968 after making a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles aspart of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. It is said hewas killed by another “lone assassin”, Sirhan Sirhan. Bobby’s death benefitedRichard Nixon, who had been supported in his political career by Prescott Bush,father of George. Nixon eventually became president at the election in which hewould have faced serious opposition from Bobby Kennedy. Nixon’s director ofsecurity in his 1968 election campaign was James Golden, who took leave from hisjob as director of security at the Lockheed Corporation. Coincidentally, it wasa guard from Lockheed, Thane Eugene Caesar, who was standing right alongsideBobby Kennedy when he was shot. Caesar, an employee of the Lansky syndicate,worked at Lockheed’s Burbank centre in the top secret area reserved for theCIA’s U-2 spy plane project. Lee Harvey Oswald was also affiliated with the U-2.Another employee of Lockheed was Richard Gernt Butler an associate of theneo-Nazi, Keith Gilbert. This same Keith Gilbert, was charged with the failedattempt to assassinate the black civil rights leader, Martin Luther King, inFebruary 1965, four days after another black leader, Malcolm X, was murdered.Gilbert said in prison that he was supported by some powerful forces and itlater emerged that he was funded by another white supremacist, Loren EugeneHall. In turn, Hall had been a witness for Edwin Meese, the legal counsel forRonald Reagan (then governor of California), in a case linked to the JFKassassination. District Attorney, Jim Garrison, issued an extradition request toReagan for the California resident, Edgar Eugene Bradley, in connection with thedeath of JFK, and Reagan asked Meese to handle it. In the course of this, LorenHall was among his informants. Reagan delayed Garrison’s request until Nixonbecame president and then refused it without comment. Meese would later becomeUS attorney general, the nation’s chief law officer, under President Reagan.Loren Hall and his son Loren Junior would be indicted for running a drug ring inOklahoma in 1989. Loren Junior called a press conference to say that the drugoperation was being used to raise funds for the Contras in Nicaragua, so belovedof Ronald Reagan and George Bush.Behind the scenes, those who killed JFK also killed Bobby. It was becomingincreasingly likely that Bobby would win the Democratic nomination and he had anexcellent chance of becoming president. This would have renewed JFK-stylepolicies in relation to the Middle East and Organised Crime. Just as important,with Bobby in the White House the opportunity was there to blow the lid off theJFK assassination. Therefore Bobby was murdered using a mind-controlled assassinand if the former CIA operative, Robert Morrow, is to be believed, Mossad andthe CIA used SAVAK, the Iran (Mossad-CIA) secret police force to do their dirtywork this time.57 It is certainly true that in the weeks before the murder, theBobby Kennedy campaign had been infiltrated by Khyber Khan, a high rankingmember of SAVAK, who used a cover story about falling out with the Shah. BobbyKennedy believed him after previous experiences with Khan, but Khan brought inmore SAVAK operatives to join him at Kennedy campaign headquarters.Lord Victor Rothschild, who was a close friend of the Shah, was involved alongwith the CIA’s James Jesus Angleton, in the overthrow of the Iranian leader,Mohammed Mossadegh, in 1953 which led to the creation of SAVAK. The patsy theyused for the assassination of Bobby Kennedy was an Arab, Sirhan Sirhan. In theweeks before he killed Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan, joined the Ancient Mystical Orderof the Rosicrucians and followed their mail order course on “how to control yourmind waves”. He learnt how to put himself into a trance by staring into his owneyes in a mirror. During these trances, he began to write incoherent threats ofviolence and assassination. He didn’t remember doing this, but afterwards herecognised the handwriting as his own. Sirhan apparently worshipped BobbyKennedy, but, it is said, he felt betrayed when Kennedy supported the deploymentof 50 war planes to Israel. Sirhan had hated Jews since he was bombed andshelled by the Israelis as an Arab boy in Palestine in 1948, the story goes.After this perceived betrayal in the two weeks before he shot Kennedy, Sirhan’strance experiences became more and more extreme. He thought he saw Kennedy’sface come out of the mirror towards him and he wrote “Kill Kennedy” in histrance notebook. “Kennedy must be assassinated before June 5th 1968” it said.June 5th was the anniversary of the Israeli victory over the Arabs. The questionis: Who was in control of Sirhan’s subconscious mind? Himself or someone else?In the view of Sirhan’s psychiatrist, Bernard L. Diamond, he self-programmedhimself to kill Kennedy.58 Pardon? Yeah, sure he did.Let us consider the remarkable ‘coincidences’ which allowed this‘self-programmed’ man to complete his mission. On the night of the killing, June4th, Sirhan said he met a friend for dinner and intended to go on to aRosicrucian meeting. But his ‘friend’ had a newspaper in which Sirhan saw anadvertisement for a parade celebrating the anniversary of the Israeli victory.The ad said the event was “this evening”, but what Sirhan didn’t realise wasthat he had somehow been given a copy of the next day’s paper. The parade wasactually the following night, the 5th. Ignorant of this, Sirhan changed hisplans for the evening and went off to the parade. Of course, he didn’t find it.According to the account given by Sirhan under hypnosis by Bernard L. Diamond,59he now felt lonely and just happened to remember a girl he knew from high schoolwho, he thought, could be found at the Ambassador Hotel where, purely by‘chance’, Bobby Kennedy’s event was taking place that same night. Sirhan driftedaround the hotel for some hours getting himself drunk. At about eleven o’clockhe decided to go home – his last conscious memory of the night. Under hypnosis,he then described walking out to his car, but he felt too ill and drunk todrive. He noticed his gun on the back seat and, concerned it might be stolen, hehid it in the top of his trousers. Back in the hotel he drank coffee with a“dark, attractive” (never identified) woman. On the way to buy another coffee,he said he found himself in an alcove with “dazzling lights and mirrors”. Hefelt dazed and bewildered. Mirrored doors led to the hotel kitchen, but hedidn’t go through them. Instead he went to the kitchen by a longer route. Sirhanfound himself in a hypnotic trance like those he experienced with theRosicrucian course. He told Diamond of how he leaned on a table feeling sleepyand unsure of where he was. Suddenly he looked up to see a group of peoplecoming towards him. He noticed that one of them was Bobby Kennedy and in hisconscious mind he decided to shake his hand. Instead he pulled out the gun andstarted shooting. As psychiatrist Diamond said: “Sirhan executed the crime in atwilight state, knowing next to nothing about what was happening”.60And so how come Bobby Kennedy was walking through the hotel kitchen at exactlythe wrong time? He had wanted to walk through the crowds after his speech, buthis ‘minders’ insisted that he leave via the kitchen to avoid possible danger!The man most insistent that Kennedy go through the kitchen was…Frank Mankiewicz,the former public relations man for the Anti-Defamation League who handled thepublicity for Oliver Stone’s film, JFK! 61 Also alongside Kennedy was ThaneEugene Caesar, the ‘security guard’ employed at the last minute, and a manconnected with the Meyer Lansky Syndicate. Lone assassin? No conspiracy? Youmust be joking. To make sure there were no mistakes, according to the CIA’sRobert Morrow, a Pakistani-American also shot Kennedy with a CIA handgundisguised as a camera. In his book The Senator Must Die, Morrow shows a pictureof the Pakistani with his “camera” seconds before Kennedy was killed. Otherresearchers suggest that no bullets fired by Sirhan Sirhan actually hit Kennedyand that the real killer was Thane Eugene Caesar.Whatever precisely happened, Bobby Kennedy was murdered by the same forces thatkilled his brother and they used a mind-controlled assassin who has remainedprogrammed and mentally scrambled ever since. It is by this same method ofhypnotic mind control that many computer programmers in the UK defence industryhave suffered bizarre “suicides” and other deaths. Many victims have worked forthe General Electric Company and its subsidiary, Marconi, and yet another coverup has suppressed the truth.One other name I believe was associated with the murders of both John and BobbyKennedy was the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onasis who made an incrediblefortune by using his ships to transport drugs. Interestingly, it is a Greekcustom that if you kill a man, you have to look after his wife and family.Onasis married Jackie, John Kennedy’s widow.Malcolm XMalcolm X was murdered while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom in New York. Allthe other speakers at the event pulled out at the last minute. Across the streetwas the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, but they refused to respond. In the endMalcolm’s aides had to run over to the hospital, grab a stretcher, and carry himthere themselves. One of his close aides, Leon 4X Ameer, went to the FBI to saythat elements within the government and the black organisation, the Nation ofIslam, had been involved. A few days later, at the age of 32, he was dead. Thecause of death was given as suicide, then a drugs overdose, and finally naturalcauses. I wonder if his doctor was trained at the Vatican! The blackconsciousness movements had long been infiltrated by the FBI and CIA andassassinations could be arranged from inside as well as outside of these blackorganisations. This FBI operation was called Cointelpro and was headedby…William Sullivan, the friend of the CIA’s Mossad mole, James Jesus Angleton!Sullivan was the liaison between the FBI and the Warren Commission and hisCointelpro operation relied heavily on information from the Anti-DefamationLeague.62 (The Elite’s control and manipulation of black groups equally appliesto anti-black groups like the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan was an Elite creation,founded by the Satanist Albert Pike, the Sovereign Grand Commander of theAncient and Accepted Rite of Scottish Freemasonry in the American South. He wasan associate of Guiseppe Mazzini, the leader of the Bavarian Illuminati afterthe death of Adam Weishaupt.63 A statue of Pike still stands today in WashingtonDC in honour of his work on behalf of the Elite.) The FBI used an anti-communistgroup called BOSSI to infiltrate the Nation of Islam and Malcolm X’s breakawaygroup, the Organisation of Afro-American Unity. The head of BOSSI was AnthonyUlazowitz and his chief operative was John Caulfield. Both were publicly exposedduring the Watergate scandal as two of the main characters in Richard Nixon’sdirty tricks department. Caulfield had been used by the Warren Commission to‘investigate’ an anti-Castro group. Common names and ties can be identifiedbetween the killings of the Kennedys, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, theWatergate scandal, and a stream of lesser known murders and events.Martin Luther KingMartin Luther King’s campaign for black rights and against the Vietnam War costhim his life on April 4th 1968. A former FBI agent would later tell the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations how staff in the Atlanta FBI office cheeredwhen the news of the shooting came through. “They got him,” one man said. “Theygot Zorro” – the FBI code name for King. “I hope he dies, the son of a bitch”said another. The former agent burst into tears as he recalled the story. DrKing was also a target of William Sullivan’s Cointelpro operation at the FBI.Same names, same people, same force.Before Dr King’s arrival at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, a manapproached the reception desk and said he was an ‘advance man’ for Dr King. Heinsisted that King’s room be changed because, said the ‘advance man’, “he wouldlike to have a room on the second floor overlooking the swimming pool”.64 Staffat the motel said they didn’t think he was a black man, but a white man wearingblack face makeup. This is a ploy used by intelligence services for agentsprovocateur who cause trouble at black demonstrations and make the blacks takethe blame for it. This character certainly had nothing to do with Martin LutherKing because he didn’t have any ‘advance men’. King was shot dead when he walkedout onto the balcony to talk with his driver.The black police officer in charge of the security for Dr King was sent homeagainst his will hours before King was killed and by then the security team hadbeen reduced from eight men to one lone policeman. The only two black firemen atthe station next to the motel were sent to other stations just for that day andwhen King was shot, the ambulance was delayed because it was blocked in byappliances from the same fire station. As retired Air Force Colonel L. FletcherProuty said: “No-one has to direct an assassination – it happens. The activerole is played secretly by permitting it to happen…This is the greatest singleclue…who has the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions…”.65That is what happened with Martin Luther King as it did with Yitzak Rabin, theIsraeli premier, in 1995. According to the Israeli press, Rabin had a number ofsecret meetings with Henry Kissinger in the weeks before his assassination.Israel’s security is fantastic as I have witnessed myself at Tel Aviv airportand no-one could kill an Israeli prime minister in the way it happened unless itwas allowed to happen.Witnesses said they were sure that the shots that killed Dr King came from theground and not from the second floor of the rooming house where another ‘patsy’,James Earl Ray, was staying. The point where the bullet entered and left Dr Kingconfirmed this. James Earl Ray could not have done it. A former FBI ballisticsexpert said that part of the rifle would have needed to be buried six inchesinto a wall for Earl Ray to have shot Dr King from where he was supposed to be.But James Earl Ray was convicted. Just another lone assassin. No conspiracy.Sure.A central character in the King assassination appears to have been JackYoungblood, a US Intelligence operative, who has been named by some researchersas the “Eggs and Sausages Man”, because he began to appear regularly at a cafeclose to the rooming house where James Earl Ray was staying. When shown apicture of Youngblood, James Earl Ray confirmed that it was the man who had beenfollowing him prior to the King assassination. One of Youngblood’s associateswas Frank Fiorini, who later changed his name to Frank Sturgis. This man was oneof the Watergate burglars.66The journalist, Lewis Lomas, investigated the King and Malcolm X assassinationsand wrote a book, To Kill A Black Man. He revealed that John Ali, the treasurerof the Nation of Islam organisation to which Malcolm X was connected for sometime, worked for the FBI. At one point, Ali was the most powerful man in theNation of Islam. Lomas was following leads which could have linked the murdersof JFK and Martin Luther King, particularly through the Guy Bannister‘Detective’ Agency in New Orleans which played a key role in the JFKassassination. Lomas intended to implicate the intelligence agencies in DrKing’s death in a film he had been contracted to make. A few days into thefilming, the brakes failed on his car and he was killed. The summer after theMemphis assassination, Dr King’s brother was mysteriously drowned in hisswimming pool. Neighbours heard screaming, splashing, and then silence. Twoyears after that, Dr King’s mother was murdered when a ‘lone nutter’ walked intoher church and opened fire. It is a matter of public record that all theseevents took place at a time when the FBI of J. Edgar Hoover was plotting to stopthe black civil rights movement and those opposing the Vietnam War. So was theAnti-Defamation League on behalf of the terrorists who control Israel.Another famous name pops up here, too. Jesse Jackson. He has become the bestknown black man in America and he was featured on Christmas Day 1994 on theBritish network television station, Channel Four, giving an ‘alternative Queen’sSpeech’ to the one being delivered by Queen Elizabeth II on other channels atthe same time. Quite an honour, if you like that sort of thing. Jackson was inthe Dr King party when King was killed, although King had told his aides that heintended to part company with him. Immediately after the assassination, Jacksonturned up at a press conference in a blood-stained shirt and told the story ofhow he held the dying Dr King in his arms. It made Jackson famous. This greatlyangered other people at the scene because they knew it wasn’t true. Nearlytwenty years later, Jackson admitted on the Phil Donahue TV Show that he hadlied. He had not held King’s head in his arms at all. Where the blood on hisshirt had come from has never been credibly explained. After George Bush (CFR)was elected president in 1988 he and Jackson (CFR) held a joint press conferencein which Jackson endorsed the view that James Earl Ray should not be releasedfrom jail on parole. This from a man who was there when Dr King died and who hassaid many times that it was not the work of a lone assassin. What goes on?The 1960s were a particularly bloody period for assassinations in the UnitedStates, but they continue today right across the world, to oust those who arenot playing the Elite game and replace them with those who will. There arescores of cover stories to hide the real instigators of these murders. It couldbe a ‘lone nutter’, an Elite-controlled ‘terrorist’ group, a plane crash (it’seasy to destabilise a small plane with the technology they have today), suicide,induced heart attacks, and so many other little ‘accidents’.WatergateOn the global stage, one of the finest exponents of the art of politicalmanipulation in modern times is the Elite’s Ambassador-at-Large, HenryKissinger, who has used a series of frontmen to do his bidding. One of the bestknown is George Bush. From Watergate and the early 1970s, these two names beganto turn up everywhere. Kissinger was not born and bred in the United States. Hewas born in Germany in 1923 and grew up as a Jew under Adolf Hitler. He arrivedin the United States on September 5th 1938, and later became a naturalisedAmerican. In 1972 the Polish KGB agent, Michael Goleniewski, told the Britishgovernment that KGB documents he saw prior to his defection in 1959 included thename Henry Kissinger as a Soviet Union asset. According to Goleniewski,Kissinger was recruited by the KGB into an espionage cell called ODRA. He wasgiven the code name BOR or COLONEL BOR, Goleniewski claimed. Kissinger built hispower-base and reputation at Harvard before becoming a leading figure in the NewWorld Order.US foreign policy under Kissinger followed the tried and trusted Britishapproach for centuries – maintain the balance of power under the rule which says“My enemy’s enemy is my friend”. It was this approach which, in part, was behindthe strategy of the Kissinger-Nixon Administration of forging links withcommunist China. During this time, before and after Watergate, Kissinger (Comm300) was in close contact with his friends in British Intelligence circles whomhe worked with over the decades. These have included other Committee of 300members like Sir Eric Roll (Lord Roll of Ipsden), and Lord Victor Rothschild themanipulator of British intelligence and Mossad, and Soviet spy along withPhilby, Burgess, Maclean, and Blunt. Blunt left the staff of the WarburgInstitute to work for MI5.67 Kissinger had close connections with Britain and Ihave no doubt that British elements including Victor Rothschild were involved inthe Kennedy assassinations, Watergate and the removal from office of RichardNixon. Kissinger himself has admitted in a speech at Chatham House which wassupposed to remain private, that he was often closer to the British ForeignOffice than his own US State Department.68Kissinger had an enormous influence on George Bush and some Bush biographersdescribe him as little more than a ‘Kissinger clone’. Bush was born into theheart of the New World Order conspiracy as the son of Prescott Bush and wasgiven all the background and experience he needed to be its frontman. He was amember of the Skull and Bones Society, a 33rd degree Freemason, member of theCommittee of 300, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission,oilman, ambassador to China and the United Nations (both under Kissinger),chairman of the Republican Party National Committee, CIA operative before,during and after the JFK assassination, head of the CIA, vice president, andthen the prize he had been groomed for since he was a boy, president of theUnited States.After Richard Nixon was returned to office in November 1972, he made Bush thechairman of the Republican Party National Committee. Bush took over,‘coincidentally’, in January 1973, during the trial of the Watergate burglars.They had entered the headquarters of the Democratic Party in the WatergateBuilding in Washington on the night of June 17th the previous year. These werethe so called ‘Plumbers’, a White House surveillance team spying on theDemocrats in the run up to the election. Or so we are led to believe. Inreality, they made a botched job of it because they were meant to be caught.That was the idea.Behind this ‘scandal’, many researchers now believe, and I certainly agree withthem, was Henry Kissinger, the frontman for the Rockefellers and theRothschilds. Kissinger left his executive job at the Council on ForeignRelations to join the Nixon administration, which contained more than 115members of the CFR.69 Nelson Rockefeller, who became vice-president as a resultof Watergate, said that Kissinger took the job because he asked him to.70Watergate was a setup to give total power to Kissinger, and therefore the Elite.This was a crucial period in the global manoeuvrings by the New World Ordermanipulators to remove what shreds were left of government for the people, bythe people. Watergate and the removal of Richard Nixon was another coup d’étaton America. Nixon was no political angel, but he was just another stooge. GeorgeBush became chairman of the Republican Party National Committee at exactly thetime the Watergate story was really breaking and his mentor, Henry Kissinger,was both national security advisor and secretary of state, the only man inAmerican history to hold those two posts at the same time. Bob Woodward and CarlBernstein, the journalists from the Elite-controlled Washington Post, were givenWatergate ‘clues’ from their informant ‘Deep Throat’, and turned them into frontpage headlines. The owner of the Post, Katharine Graham (CFR, TC, Bil), musthave been delighted with their well-informed journalism. Their stories put somuch pressure on Nixon that he had no time to oversee the government of thecountry. So Graham’s friend Henry Kissinger did that instead.It is public knowledge that it was Kissinger who persuaded Nixon to create theWhite House Special Investigations Unit (the Plumbers) with the job of stoppingWhite House leaks. Kissinger cited to Nixon the leaking of the ‘Pentagon Papers’in 1971 to justify the need to set up the unit. It emerged later that one of theWatergate burglars, E. Howard Hunt, a CIA planner of the Bay of Pigs invasionwhich discredited Kennedy, and a man involved at some level in the Dealey Plazaoperation, had been to the Miami CIA station to recruit people for Kissinger’sWhite House Unit two months before the Pentagon Papers were leaked.71 Create theproblem, then offer the solution. The White House Unit was full of CIA and otherintelligence operatives and it was funded by Bill Liedtke, the president of theGeorge Bush company, Pennzoil, and a close friend of Bush, the Republican Partychairman. Wright Patman, the chairman of the House of Representatives Bankingand Currency Committee, confirmed that one of the Watergate burglars was sent$100,000 by the chairman of the Texas committee of the Campaign to Re-elect thePresident, known, appropriately, as CREEP. The burglar who received the moneywas Bernard Barker, a CIA man since the Bay of Pigs invasion. The man who sentthe money was…Bill Liedtke, George Bush’s business partner and one of hisclosest friends.72 Congressional investigator, Wright Patman, established thatthe $100,000 was actually donated by Robert H. Allen, who was Liedtke’s chieffinancial officer at CREEP in Texas. The money went from Houston into Mexico tobe laundered and then back via Liedtke to Watergate burglar, Bernard Barker.73In 1982, Robert H. Allen was given the Torch of Liberty Award by theAnti-Defamation League (ADL), the dreadful Elite–Mossad front supported sovigorously by Henry Kissinger.Another business partner and close friend of Bush, Robert Mosbacher, was alsoimplicated in the CREEP money laundering policy. Yet Bush said he knew nothingof what was going on! Are we really expected to believe that George Bush, thechairman of the Republican National Committee, a man with fingers in more piesthan a bakers’ convention, did not know that his closest friends and businessassociates were involved in laundering contributions to CREEP and channelling itto Watergate burglars? Are we really? Senator Patman was getting close toimplicating some famous names in the Watergate break in, but he was unable tocontinue his investigation. His committee, which had a Democratic majority,ordered him to stop and the plan to subpoena twenty-three CREEP officials totestify before Congress was cancelled. Why would they do that? Perhaps theKentucky Democrat, William Curlin, had the answer when he said:> “…certain members of the committee were reminded of various past political> indiscretions, or of relatives who might suffer as a result of a pro-subpoena> vote.” 74A vicious attack on Patman and his investigation was led by the House Republicanleader, Gerald Ford (CFR, Bil), the 33rd degree Freemason, member of the WarrenCommission, and puppet of the Rockefeller-Morgan-Harriman-Mellon empires of theEastern Establishment. When Nixon was forced to resign over Watergate, GeraldFord became president. Nixon was doomed after the release of the infamous‘smoking gun tape’, the recording of a conversation between himself and hischief of staff, H.R. Haldeman on June 23rd 1972, in which he discussed ways tofrustrate the Watergate investigations. When Bush heard the tape had beenreleased, he was extremely disturbed. He knew that “the Texans” mentioned on thetape was a reference to himself and his close associates, Bill Liedtke andRobert Mosbacher. In the Woodward and Bernstein book, Final Days, they report aconversation about Bush’s reaction between William Timmons, the White HouseCongressional Liaison, and Dean Burch, a White House counsellor:> “Dean, does Bush know about the [smoking gun] transcript yet?”> “Yes.”> “Well, what did he do?”> “He broke out into assholes and shit himself to death.”But Bush could breathe easy. He would not be exposed by the tape to the widerpublic. Robert Mosbacher survived unscathed, too, and was to become Secretary ofCommerce in the Bush presidency. Kissinger’s conversations at the White Housewere not recorded, but those of Nixon always were. The man in charge of therecordings and the tapes which condemned Nixon was David Young, a Wall Streetlawyer appointed by Kissinger and a man who had worked for the Rockefellers. Theexistence of the “Smoking Gun Tapes” was revealed by Alexander Butterfield, theWhite House liaison with the secret service. The overall head of the secretservice was Kissinger. Another Kissinger appointee very significant in thedemise of Nixon was Rockefeller-puppet and Knight of Malta, Alexander Haig (TC)(CFR), who would go on to be military head of NATO and Ronald Reagan’s secretaryof state. Nixon still refused to resign despite the tapes, and the nightmare forKissinger, Haig and their fellow conspirators, was for Nixon to appear before animpeachment trial at which the whole plot could be exposed. Eventually pressurefrom Bush and Kissinger forced his hand.Ford (CFR, Bil) took over as Kissinger’s frontman (using the title President ofthe United States), and he pardoned Nixon for any offences he may havecommitted, thus avoiding further investigations or trial. Ford named NelsonRockefeller (CFR, Bil) as his vice-president and made him head of an‘investigation’ into the activities of the intelligence agencies in the light ofWatergate. Also on the Rockefeller Commission was Ronald Reagan. It foundnothing of worth and did nothing of substance. The Elite now had completecontrol of the United States administration. With the help of Ford andRockefeller, and supervised by Kissinger, the nature of governmentadministration was to become a fully-fledged dictatorship. That has continued tothis day, through the political and economic cartels which have chosen andcontrolled the presidents who have followed: Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.Whoever follows Clinton will be chosen in the same way. Watergate was more thanjust a break-in. It was the destruction of what was left of the democraticprocess and all the main people behind it escaped prosecution.Iran-ContraAfter a period as the United States representative in China while the Chineseand Henry Kissinger were supporting Pol Pot in Cambodia, George Bush returnedhome in 1975. He received a telegram from Kissinger saying that he was beingnominated by Ford (Kissinger) to be the Director of the CIA. This is a majorElite organisation, as is British Intelligence, which is probably above the CIAin the Elite pyramid. It was British Intelligence that helped to set up the CIAafter the war. The familiar names step forward again. A key figure behind theformation of the Office of Strategic Services, later the CIA, was GeneralWilliam J. Donovan. He studied law at Columbia University under ProfessorHarland F. Stone, who would later become US Attorney General and appoint Donovanas his assistant. Another of Stone’s protégés was J. Edgar Hoover, who would behead of the FBI, and one of Donovan’s classmates was Franklin D. Roosevelt, thefuture President. In the First World War and between the wars, Donovan accepteda number of intelligence assignments from the New World Order brigade, includingJ.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds, and on one occasion he spentan evening with Adolf Hitler. In 1941 he was appointed head of the new OSSintelligence agency by his friend from Columbia, Franklin Roosevelt. Donovan wasassisted by James Paul Warburg, the son of Paul Warburg. It was James Warburgwho said: “We shall have a world government whether or not you like it – byconquest or consent.” 75 However, it seems Donovan was not actually in charge ofthe OSS. According to Eustace Mullins in The World Order, Our Secret Rulers,Winston Churchill’s military secretary, Colonel E.I. Jacob, was told by MajorDesmond Morton Church, the Prime Minister’s liaison with British Intelligence,in September 1941:> “Another most secret fact of which the Prime Minister is aware is that to all> intents and purposes US Security is being run for them at the President’s> request by the British. A British officer sits in Washington with Mr Edgar> Hoover and General Bill Donovan for this purpose. It is of course essential> that this fact should not be known.”The leading British coordinator of the OSS and its policy was WilliamStephenson, the head of the Special Intelligence Section of the SecretIntelligence Service (SIS) and he was given a floor of the Rockefeller Centerrent free. From there he ran a network of British agents in the United Stateswhich, according to Mullins, were involved in the murders of German sailors inNew York, acts designed to entice Hitler to declare war on America. Stephensonand Louis Bloomfield, the head of Permindex, also ran Operation Underworld withthe Lansky syndicate. Mullins suggests that three other members of the BritishChiefs of Staff behind the creation of the OSS were: Lord Louis Mountbatten(Comm 300, Bil), a cousin of the King and related to the Frankfurt bankingfamilies, Rothschild and Cassel; Charles Hambro, director of Hambros Bank andthe Special Operations Executive; and Colonel Stewart Menzies, head of theSecret Intelligence Service (SIS). Lord Victor Rothschild was also at the heartof it.OSS agents in Europe were trained at the British espionage headquarters atBletchley Park, close to Woburn Abbey, from where Sefton Delmer (agent toCommittee of 300 newspaper tycoon, Lord Beaverbrook) operated a British dirtytricks department. Woburn was the home of the Duke of Bedford, Marquess ofTavistock. The British Bureau of Psychological Warfare became known as theTavistock Institute. After the war, Donovan was special assistant to the USprosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials to ensure that British and Americaninvolvement with the Nazis was not revealed. President Truman disbanded the OSSin 1945, but it was reformed as the CIA in 1948 under the control of Allen W.Dulles, a major funder of Adolf Hitler. Appropriately, Dulles, a director ofHitler’s bankers, J. Henry Schroder (Comm 300), chose them to handle CIA funds.The CIA is an arm of the tax-exempt foundation syndicates controlled by theRockefellers/Rothschilds, like the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation,and the Carnegie organisation, through which much of the CIA policy is decided.But although the CIA is extremely important to the New World Order, the realpower in American intelligence circles is the National Security Agency (NSA), anorganisation that keeps its head down while the CIA does its dirty work. Sowhile Bush was head of the CIA and even when he was president, he would beanswerable to higher masters within the Elite. In his book, The Matrix, ValdamarValerian reports the following conversation with a man claimed to be a CIAoperative:> “Don’t kid yourself…the CIA is just a whipping boy. NSA are the ones with the> hit teams. Look into their records – you won’t find a thing. Look into their> budget – you can’t. The CIA is just a figurehead, but as far as intelligence> goes, the NSA’s far superior to them – far in advance in the ‘black arts’. The> CIA gets blamed for what the NSA does. NSA is far more vicious and far more> accomplished in its operations. …The CIA gets the information, but the> military heads the show…> “There are about 18 or 20 people running this country. They have not been> elected. The elected people are only figureheads for the guys who have a lot> more power than even the President of the United States.> [Valerian]: “You mean the president is powerless?”> “Not exactly powerless. He has the power to make decisions on what is> presented to him. The Intelligence agencies tell him only what they want to> tell him.” 76Bush was not heading an independent CIA, but an element within the so called‘Inner Fed’ of the secret government which consists of the CIA, NSA, FBI, NASA,and the Federal Reserve. Much of the funding for this cartel of manipulationcomes from its involvement in the hard drugs trade.Many of the people involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion in the early 1960s, whowould also turn up in the 1980s in the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal, wouldbe employed by George Bush during his period at the CIA. Bush was not new to theintelligence game and I believe his connections with the CIA go back to the1950s.In The Immaculate Deception,77 Russell S. Bowen names him as a top CIA agentsince before the Bay of Pigs invasion, when he worked with Felix Rodriquez andother anti-Castro Cubans. Intriguingly, the top secret code name for the Bay ofPigs Invasion was “Operation Zapata”.78 Bush’s oil company was called ZapataOil.Rodriquez would turn up again in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan-Bushadministration, which made more hard drugs available to the young people of theUnited States. When you look at the personnel in the Plumbers group involved inthe Watergate break-in, a remarkable number of them were also involved in theBay of Pigs. A CIA coordinator, William Buckley said that if he told what heknew about the Bay of Pigs and the Kennedy assassination “it would be thebiggest scandal ever to rock the nation.” 79 Buckley would later be assassinatedin the Middle East. There is plenty of documented evidence that George Bush wasa long-time CIA asset, since before the Kennedy assassination when the familyfriend, Allen Dulles, was head of the CIA. There is evidence that Bush wascloser to the Kennedy assassination than people have believed.80From his office at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Bush put togetherhis team. Among them was the infamous Theodore Shackley, whom Bush named as theCIA’s associate deputy director for covert operations. Shackley had been head ofthe CIA Station in Miami during the early 1960s, from where E. Howard Hunt andhis Watergate burglars would emerge. Shackley went on to head the CIA station inSaigon during the Vietnam War, where he masterminded Operation Phoenix. Thisinvolved the deaths of tens of thousands of Vietnamese civilians who were‘suspected’ to be working for the Viet Cong. Just being able to read and writewas enough to invite this suspicion, apparently. Oliver North, the ‘star’ ofIran-Contra, worked with Shackley on Operation Phoenix, which is reputed to havemurdered 40,000 South Vietnamese villagers for Meyer Lansky and the CIA.Shackley ran a huge assassination and drug operation in South East Asia in the1970s in which two other Bush men, Donald Gregg (Bil) and Felix Rodriquez, wereinvolved. This operation was threatened by John Kennedy seeking to withdraw fromVietnam. This same Theodore Shackley was now appointed to an important positionin Bush’s CIA and he would later be recruited as Bush’s ‘speech writer’ duringthe 1979-80 election campaign.The idea that someone like Shackley would be hired to write Bush’s speechesdefies the imagination. No doubt his other ‘talents’ were the real reason forhis presence. Today Shackley apparently lives in Medellin, Colombia, the home ofthe drug cartel. How thoroughly appropriate. Thomas Clines, a formersecond-in-command at the CIA station in Miami, was another Bush appointee to hisCIA administration who would be involved in Iran-Contra, a scandal Bush was tosay he knew nothing about. During Bush’s tenure in the CIA, the operatives knewthat they could virtually do as they liked because their director had a gift forlooking the other way. The power over the US Intelligence operations wasconcentrated in Bush’s hands as a result of a series of measures by PresidentFord. In the words of the Elite’s New York Times, Ford: “…centralised more powerin the hands of the Director of Central Intelligence than any had had since thecreation of the CIA”.81Bush turned the screw on journalists who asked unpleasant questions while, atthe same time, he was paying other ‘journalists’ to be CIA informants. Onereporter who suffered from Bush’s wrath was Daniel Schorr (CFR) of CBS. Bush waspictured on the front page of the Washington Star angrily remonstrating withSchorr on Capitol Hill for leaking information which put the CIA in a less thangood light. Schorr, who was on Nixon’s list of ‘enemies’ during the Watergateaffair, was sacked by CBS. The late owner of CBS, William Paley (Comm 300), owedmuch to the Bush family. The credit which enabled him to buy the TV network waspersonally arranged by Prescott Bush, who was a CBS director in the 1950s.The contacts George Bush made at the CIA would be invaluable when he becamevice-president to Ronald Reagan on January 21st 1981. Reagan’s personal fortunedates from a time shortly after becoming governor of California when he boughtsome land cheaply and sold it at a vast profit to a group of benefactors whohave never been publicly identified.82 (I bet I could have a decent shot at whothey were!) He was, at 70, the oldest man to be inaugurated as president. Hismind was failing and he needed long afternoon naps each day. Almost every wordhe spoke, even in relatively off-the-cuff situations when greeting foreignleaders, was written for him on cards by his aides. George Bush was president infact, if not in name. After an assassination attempt on Reagan by another ‘lonenutter’, John Hinckley,83 his sharpness of mind further deteriorated and hisneed for sleep increased. This gave George Bush almost complete control ofaffairs and in the background would have been hovering his mentor, HenryKissinger.Bush built a network of organisations within the government with himself at itshead. These were the Standing Crisis Pre-Planning Group, the Crisis ManagementCentre, the Terrorist Incident Working Group, the Taskforce on CombatingTerrorism, and the Operations Sub-Group. These were all subordinate to, andcontrolled by, the Special Situation Group chaired by Bush. If ever there was aline-up of problem-reaction-solution and ‘managed crisis’ organisations, thenthis was it. Through this network would come the arms-for-drugs operation,Iran-Contra.Bush hired his former CIA associate, Donald P. Gregg, as his main advisor onnational security and Gregg brought with him a ‘former’ CIA assassinationsmanager, Felix I. Rodriquez, whom Bush had known back to the time of the Bay ofPigs invasion and during his period as head of the CIA. Gregg and Rodriquez wereinvolved with Theodore Shackley in the assassination and drug-running operationin Southeast Asia, and the two now worked out of George Bush’s office! It wasstrictly illegal under US law for the government to supply arms to Iran or tosupply the Nicaraguan ‘freedom fighters’, the Contras, in their war with theSandinista government. It was certainly illegal to accept payment with drugs inreturn. The Reagan-Bush administration would do all of these things.One of the ways the US government secretly undermined the Sandinistas was bymining harbours in Nicaragua. This was done by a company called ContinentalShelf Associates Inc which is based on Jupiter Island, Florida. Jupiter Islandis an interesting place. It became the feifdom of the Harriman set…includingGeorge Bush, who has a home there. Jupiter Island has been a base forgenerations of New World Order families. Continental Shelf Associates (CSA)lists many oil companies and government agencies among its clients. They includethe Rockefellers’ Exxon and the Bush-Liedtke company, Pennzoil.CSA was used by the US military for coastal mapping and reconnaissance inGrenada before the invasion in October 1983 and during US operations in Lebanon.The company was run by Robert ‘Stretch’ Stevens, a close associate of TheodoreShackley and Felix Rodriquez when they were all involved in Vietnam and the Bayof Pigs. A CSA company at the same address is Acta Non Verba, which means‘action, not words’. A high level CIA officer quoted in George Bush, TheUnofficial Biography, said of this CSA subsidiary:> “Assassination operations and training company controlled by Ted Shackley,> under cover of a private corporation with a regular board of directors,> stockholders, etc, located in Florida. They covertly bring in Haitian and> South East Asian boat people as recruits, as well as Koreans, Cubans, and> Americans. They hire out assassinations and intelligence services to> governments, corporations, and individuals…” 84The bombs planted in the harbours of Nicaragua caused such a row in the US thatthe laws against such action, the Boland laws as they were called, were stillfurther strengthened. But at a secret meeting of the National Planning Group onJune 25th 1984, Reagan, Bush, Casey, and other top officials decided to ignorethe law. They would fund the Contras through Honduras, just as they had used ElSalvador against the Sandinistas. Bush and Oliver North, an official of theNational Security Council, travelled together to El Salvador. While Bush is sokeen in public about “Wars on Drugs”, the smuggling of hard drugs getsuncomfortably close to him time and again. On January 18th 1985, Felix Rodriquezis known to have met his namesake (but not thought to be a relative), RamonMilian Rodriguez,85 an accountant and money launderer who worked for theMedellin cocaine cartel in Colombia. From his prison cell in Butner, NorthCarolina, Ramon told the investigative journalist, Martha Honey:> “…[Felix offered] in exchange for money for the Contra cause he would use his> influence in high places to get the [cocaine] cartel US goodwill…Frankly one> of the selling points was that he could talk directly to Bush. The issue of> good will wasn’t something that was going to go through 27 bureaucratic hands.> It was something that was directly between him and Bush.” 86This could easily be done, given that Felix Rodriquez was working from Bush’soffice. A memo in early September 1986, sent to Oliver North by retired ArmyMajor General, John K. Singlaub, said that Rodriquez was talking of having‘daily contact’ with Bush’s office and this, said the memo, could damagePresident Reagan and the Republican Party. Oliver North would also write in hisnotebook that “Felix has been talking too much about the VP [vice-president]”.87In his 1987 book, Out Of Control, Leslie Cockburn presents devastating evidenceof Bush’s involvement in Iran-Contra and the drug running. He says that planeschartered by the CIA and packed with cocaine flew directly into the HomesteadAirforce Base in Florida using a CIA code signal.In 1986, the Reagan-Bush administration admitted that Adolfo Chamorro’s Contras,who were supported by the CIA, were helping a Colombian drug traffickertransport drugs into the United States, and the testimony of John Stockwell, aformer high ranking CIA official, revealed that drug smuggling was an essentialcomponent of the CIA operation with the Contras. George Morales, one of SouthAmerica’s biggest traffickers, testified that he was approached in 1984 to flyweapons to the Contras. In return, he says, the CIA helped him to smugglethousands of kilos of cocaine into the United States via an airstrip on theranch of John Hull, a self confessed CIA agent, and associate of Oliver North.At the time, George Bush was having a war on drugs – for public consumptiononly.Meanwhile, the other wing of Iran-Contra was continuing, thearms-for-hostages-deal with Iran. Oliver North was heavily involved in thesupply of arms to Iran, via Israel, in return for hostages. The release of thehostages was explained, in part, by the efforts of Terry Waite, therepresentative of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Waite was being used without hisknowledge by North who was quite happy for him to take the credit for releaseswhich were, in fact, the result of arms sales via Israel. Waite would eventuallybe taken hostage himself. Bush, who as George Shultz publicly confirmed,supported the arms-for-hostages policy, was telling the nation: “We will make noconcessions to terrorists”. The money and drugs involved in the arms transfersto Iran were laundered through Switzerland, that centre for Global Eliteactivities. Jean Ziegler, a member of the Swiss Parliament, writes in his book,Switzerland Washes Whiter:> “The Commerce developed by North and his accomplices was as simple as it was> lucrative. With the expert assistance of the Swiss magnates, as well as some> discreet help from the Swiss Secret Service, they delivered American and> Israeli weapons to the Imam Khomeini. The Imam paid for some of the weaponry> in dollars, but for most of it in drugs [morphine base and heroin]. The> godfathers of Turkish and Lebanese networks installed in Zurich turned the> drugs into cash on the international market. After taking their cut of the> profits, the godfathers deposited the remainder in numbered accounts that had> been opened in the main banks and financial institutions of Geneva and> Zurich.”In an interview for Italian Television in May 1990, the CIA agent, IbrahimRazin, said that he had learned from a leading Mafia boss that Licio Gelli ofthe P2 Freemasonary Lodge had sent a telegram in February 1986 to Phil Guarino,a close associate of George Bush. According to Razin, the telegram said: “Tellour good friend Bush that the Swedish tree will be felled”. Three days later,the Swedish Prime Minister and Bilderberger, Olof Palme, was assassinated.Razin, who went into hiding in fear of his life, said that Palme was killedbecause he knew too much about the American arms trafficking to Iran which,Razin said, P2 had been involved in. Part of the reason for the arms to Iran, hesaid, was the payback from Bush and his colleagues for the Khomeini regimedelaying the release of American hostages in the so called “October Surprise”.This was when the Reagan-Bush campaign had negotiated with the Iranians not torelease American hostages until after the election against Jimmy Carter toprevent Carter getting the credit, and therefore the votes, for their release.The plane which flew 51 of the 52 hostages home left Iran as Reagan and Bushwere being inaugurated.While all the leading politicians are implicated with, or controlled by, theGlobal Elite network, there is great rivalry between some of them and thisallows the Elite to play them off against each other. Even at the higher levelsof the pyramid, the personnel are being manipulated by those even nearer thetop. George Bush flew to Paris to meet with Iranian officials, includingAyatollah Mehdi, at the Hotel Ritz on October 19th 1980. Among thoseaccompanying Bush were William Casey, the soon-to-be head of the CIA; DonaldGregg, the CIA operative; Robert McFarlane, who had been a member of PresidentCarter’s National Security Council; Senators John Tower and John Heinz; and along-time CIA and Office of Naval Intelligence operative, Gunthar Russbacher. Itwas John Tower, a Texas senator at the time of the Kennedy assassination, whotold the CIA’s police detective Gary Wean about the CIA’s “fake” assassinationplot involving E. Howard Hunt. Russbacher described the event in intricatedetail to Rodney Stich, a former federal inspector and author of the book,Defrauding America. Russbacher claims he flew Bush back to the States in a twoseater SR-71, which allowed Bush to arrive in time to make a speech at theWashington Hilton. This event was used to deny the Paris meeting on the groundsof time and logistics. But Ari Ben-Menashe, an agent with Israel’s (and theRothschild’s) Mossad, also confirms the meeting took place. He was there becauseIsrael was the middleman for the arms deal between the US and Iran. Bush hasalways denied being in Paris or that he knew anything about the October Surpriseand arms shipments to Iran. Defrauding America includes copies of a number ofletters from the National Security Agency which describe the Iran operation.Each is marked…“Copy to V.P. George Bush.” Poor old George needs to consult oneof those mail order books you see: How To Improve Your Memory.It may seem hard to believe that a drug-for-arms operation run illegally fromGeorge Bush’s office could be covered up so well that he would then be electedpresident, but the extent of media control should not be underestimated. Coverups are the daily bread of the Elite. They can’t cover up everything, just asthey cannot control everything, and they have had some spectacular failures onboth counts. But as a rule they are extremely effective in keeping informationthat would expose the game from the public.In late 1986, the Iran-Contra scandal blew. On October 5th, a plane left theIlopango air base in El Salvador with arms and ammunition for the Contraterrorists in Nicaragua. The flight had been coordinated by officials withinGeorge Bush’s office. As the plane came low to make the drop, it was grounded bya Sandanista missile. Three people died in the crash, but cargo handler, EugeneHasenfus, parachuted into the hands of the Sandanistas. Bush was alerted in acall to his office by drug-runner Felix Rodrigeuz. The truth was out. Or some ofit was.The power of the Elite channels can be the only explanation of how, despite theoverwhelming evidence against him – far, far, more than I have outlined here –Bush evaded prosecution, even though Buz Sawyer, the pilot of the crashed plane,was found to have the private phone number of George Bush’s office in hispocket! Hasenfus also stated that George Bush knew about the whole thing. ButBush denied any involvement or knowledge of what happened, and subordinates likeDon Regan, Admiral John Poindexter, Oliver North and Major General RichardSecord were sacrificed and scapegoated. They were heavily involved, of thatthere is no doubt, but Bush got away with it, as did Reagan and his Secretary ofDefense, Casper Weinberger (CFR, TC). North, who was up to his eyes in theintrigue, faced hearings and, given the evidence, it was staggering that heshould not only escape punishment, but emerge as almost an American hero. Of allthe peoples in the world, certain expressions of the American psyche have beenthe easiest to dupe. Others involved, like CIA Director William Casey, hadhealth problems. In the aftermath of the Iran-Contra revelations, Casey (whoknew the whole story) literally could not speak following an operation for a‘brain tumour’ that took away his ability to talk. Two months later he was dead.In his presidential election campaign, Bush pledged to build a ‘kinder, gentler’America.The Tower Commission was appointed to investigate the Iran-Contra affair,chaired by our old friend, the Texas Senator, John Tower. This is the same JohnTower who, according to CIA man Gunthar Russbacher, was on the plane with Bushwhen he flew to Paris for the October Surprise meeting with the Iranians! TheJohn Tower who knew the real story of Lee Harvey Oswald. Also on the TowerCommission was Brent Scowcroft (CFR, TC, Bil), a Kissinger ‘yes man’ and anexecutive of Kissinger Associates; and Ed Muskie, another do-as-you’re-toldpolitician who could be twisted to suppress the truth. Muskie was himselfimplicated in both the October Surprise and Iran-Contra. As you can see, theCommission was thoroughly independent. It cleared George Bush of all blame andinvolvement. When Bush became president he made John Tower his secretary ofdefense. Tower was asked by reporters if this appointment was a pay-off fromBush. His response?> “As the Commission was made up of three people, Brent Scowcroft, and Ed Muskie> in addition to myself, that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent> Scowcroft and Ed Muskie…We found nothing to implicate the Vice President…I> wonder what kind of pay-off they’re going to get?” 88I can tell him. Bush appointed Brent Scowcroft as his National Security Advisor.The Senate refused to accept Tower’s appointment and he began to speak of theinjustice he believed had been done to him. He died in a plane crash on April5th 1991. When the Senate turned down Tower, a decision Bush probablyengineered, he selected Dick Cheney (CFR) as defense secretary. Cheney was thesenior Republican member of another committee which cleared Bush of involvementin Iran-Contra, the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert ArmsTransactions with Iran. A group of other people, including former defensesecretary, Casper Weinberger, were given a pardon by Bush for their involvementin Iran-Contra. This came on Christmas Eve 1992, a matter of weeks before theywere due to face a trial which would have implicated Bush. In January 1993, hethen passed over the presidency to Bill Clinton who continued the cover-upbecause – as we shall see in the next chapter – he was involved too! TheWashington Post and the rest of the mainstream media which had turned acomparatively minor break-in at the Watergate building into a scandal thatdethroned Richard Nixon, kept their heads down as the United States governmentsold arms to terrorists in exchange for drugs for American children. It isactually possible to coordinate a drug running and arms running operation fromthe White House and get away with it. Unbelievable, maybe, but true all thesame.The Oklahoma BombOn April 19th 1995, I believe that the Global Elite, via elements within the USgovernment, the CIA and Mossad, murdered some 168 men, women and children in thebombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.I do not agree with the approach of the ‘people’s militias’ which have expandedenormously across the United States in the face of the evidence that the NewWorld Order agenda includes a coup d’état on dissidents who oppose the tyranny.The militias arm and train themselves in readiness for what they see as theinevitable day when the New World Order troops will arrive on their doorstep.Meeting violence with violence is not my scene. I would not pull a trigger if mylife depended upon it. What would be the point? I wish to see an end toviolence, not add to it, and my own view of life and creation could hardly bemore at odds with that of the ‘Christian Patriotism’ at the heart of themilitias’ belief system. But for months before the Oklahoma bombing, I wasreading reports from America of how the government was targeting these militiasand hounding them, not the least because they were having some considerablesuccess in circulating information about the plans of the Global Elite. Then,suddenly, came that horrific bomb and the blame was dumped not only on a fewpeople, but on the whole of the militia movement.What was Bill Clinton’s response and that of his attorney general, Janet Reno,the subject of much criticism by the militias? To use the bombing as an excuseto increase the powers of the FBI to infiltrate and attack these groups and, asClinton put it, to “ease the restrictions on the involvement of the military indomestic law enforcement”. This is similar to the policy of UK Prime MinisterJohn Major, when he allowed the MI5 intelligence agency to become involved indomestic law enforcement. The idea is to turn the intelligence agencies and themilitary into the world police who will enforce the New World Order. Clintonalso used Oklahoma to urge the media to ban “anti-government extremists” fromtheir papers, screens, and microphones and attacked the talk radio shows whichinvolve the public and offer a rare opportunity to communicate information whichdiffers from the official line. A former official of the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) was harangued and accused of stirring up theclimate of opinion that led to Oklahoma. How was this man supposed to be doingthis? By saying that the BATF, which was responsible for the Waco massacre, wasrotten to the core when he worked for it and remained so today.I wonder how many Americans saw the irony of a president denying that Americawas becoming an authoritarian state while at the very same time he was using thebombing to push it closer to exactly that. And who supported the ‘Democrat’president in this? His chief ‘opponent’, Newt Gingrich, the ‘Republican’ Speakerof the House. What a surprise. Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Gingrich,are all stooges for the same One Party State in which the same force controlsboth the Republicans and their ‘opponents’, the Democrats.The Oklahoma bombing could well have been problem-reaction-solution of the mostgrotesque kind. Do you think that a force which creates wars that cost tens ofmillions of lives, kills presidents, and blows passenger aircraft out of thesky, would not sacrifice the lives of children for their sick ambitions? If onlythat were so. The FBI and the Bill Clinton/Janet Reno Justice Department claimsthat one explosion destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, and that thebomb was concocted by the former soldier Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols fromfertiliser and fuel oil. McVeigh has said that he was microchipped while servingin the US forces. This is done to many US soldiers and, as you will see in alater chapter, a microchipped person can be used to do almost anything. For anevent like the Oklahoma bomb, however, they would require support from powerfulsources. Ted Gunderson of Santa Monica, California, a man of 28 years experiencewith the FBI, believes the official explanation of the bomb to be bothridiculous and impossible.89 Gunderson, and other contacts within the FBI,believe that the blast was caused by an electrohydrodynamic gaseous fuel deviceknown as a barometric bomb. To know how to make such a bomb you would requiresecurity clearance at the highest levels of the government/military and haveaccess to a wide range of chemicals and electronic technology. The barometricbomb has “Q” clearance, which puts it on a level of security and secrecy withnuclear weapons components. If Gunderson is correct, someone like McVeigh andothers charged with him, could not possibly have such knowledge or resources.The very idea would be ludicrous.Gunderson says he spoke to one of the inventors of the barometric bomb and wastold that the devastation caused to the building was exactly in line with whatsuch a device would achieve. The bomb works like this. There is a firstexplosion using an explosive known as PETN and this releases a lethal cloud ofchemicals, ammonium nitrate, and aluminum silicate. The cloud, Gunderson says,is energised with a “high potential electrostatic field”. There then follows asecond blast a few seconds later using another explosive called PDTN whichignites this cloud and creates an explosion of greater magnitude than TNT. Toconfirm that a top secret barometic bomb was used in Oklahoma there would needto be traces of the appropriate chemicals and there had to be two explosions afew seconds apart and not just one, as the Clinton administration and the FBIare claiming. At a court hearing in El Reno, Oklahoma, on April 28th 1995, theFBI Special Agent, John Hersley, said a shirt that McVeigh was wearing whenarrested was found to contain traces of the explosive PDTN.90 And when Gundersonchecked with the seismographic record at the Oklahoma Geological Survey at theUniversity of Oklahoma, it revealed that there had been…two explosions, tenseconds apart. The first went off at 9.02 am and 13 seconds and another followedat 9.02am and 23 seconds. That could not possibly happen with a fertiliser bomb,a claim for which there is no credible evidence anyway. Other bomb experts havesuggested different devices to the one described by Gunderson, but they agreewith him that the government ‘explanation’ is ridiculous. Rubble from the Murrahbuilding was piled up against the general records office across the street onthe other side of the truck which supposedly exploded with the fuel-fertiliserbomb. The only way the rubble could have blown in that direction was by anexplosion inside the Murrah building. Very conveniently, the building wasdemolished by the authorities and the debris removed before it could be properlyinvestigated.There is an excellent chance that elements of the US government and its agenciesblew up its own building and killed some 168 men, women and children, to furtherthe goals of the New World Order under problem-reaction-solution. Stunned? Whowouldn’t be? I think, however, that this is a bomb too far for the Elite. Ibelieve the truth will eventually come out and reveal a much wider picture.The government has consistently increased the size of the ‘fertiliser’ bomb itclaims was built by McVeigh and co, because the size of the bomb and the extentof the devastation are clearly at odds. It was first announced that the‘fertiliser’ bomb weighed 1,000 pounds, but this has since increased in stagesto reach some 4,800 pounds. As a result, the description of the vehicle used tocarry it has had to change in line with the ever greater weight involved. Thebomb was first carried in a delivery van, according to government announcements,but now it has changed to a removal van. Stand by for the articulated truck tomake an appearance! As Michael J. Riconosciuto, the designer of the barometricbomb said, a fertiliser bomb would have scattered fertiliser all over the site.This did not happen at Oklahoma.91 Many government officials who would normallyhave been in the building that day were not there, including some of those fromthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), who were supposed to havebeen the target of the bomb because of their genocide at Waco. Also, Michael J.Riconosciuto revealed to Spotlight that records and components of his barometricbomb were stolen in two raids on a well-guarded warehouse in Aberdeen,Washington State, in 1988. On the first occasion, he said, those involved wereset free by police without charges and on the second the police watched therobbers carry out the raid and yet did nothing! 92 The whole thing stinks andyet the American people have allowed themselves to be so duped that they havepermitted, and even demanded, the increased powers of the government to openmail, tap phones, search homes, and take away papers and documents at will.These powers have been achieved by using the excuse of a bomb which elementswithin the government are almost certainly responsible for.Problem-reaction-solution. I believe that the Anti-Defamation League will proveto be seriously implicated and we can expect more ‘set-ups’ of this nature todiscredit those who expose the truth.Wake Up America… Wake Up World!All this has happened so many times before. The Kennedy assassination was usedby his successor, Lyndon Johnson, to increase the powers of the State, as haveother such engineered events and ‘problems’. The CIA, often in league withMossad, has been responsible for some horrific terrorist outrages abroadinvolving the murder of children, thousands of them if the full truth be told.In Beirut in 1983, a car bomb planted by the CIA-Mossad went off. It failed tokill its intended target, a muslim cleric, but instead murdered 91 passers-by, astory later revealed by the former CIA operations analyst in Vietnam and LatinAmerica, Gordon Thurlow.93We are dealing here with a consciousness working through these people that knowsno scale of horror it would not use to achieve its end and, as we saw inOklahoma, it is supported by a media peopled by a combination of the few whoknow what is going on and the many who are nothing more than manipulators’mouthpieces, while having no idea that this is so. The way the ‘journalists’ andtelevision ‘correspondents’ simply repeated the government’s version of eventswithout question was incredible. Anyone who suggested that the New World Orderwas happening was dismissed as ‘paranoid’ and yet at least 99.9% of thosereporters will never have read a single word about the conspiracy. Nice to knowthat those who inform us are so informed themselves!Margaret ThatcherThe sort of methods of covert manipulation and cover-up I have mentioned hereare happening around the world every day. Even the demise of Margaret Thatcheras Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1990 is also linked with the storiesI have outlined here.Assassinations can become a problem when investigators won’t let them go away,as with the JFK killing in particular, and it is easier and ‘cleaner’ from theElite point of view to remove people more subtly by creating events, ofteneconomic in nature, which undermine leaders and cause them to be removed‘democratically’. Margaret Thatcher, a Bilderberg attendee, was an Elite choicewho served the cause well economically during the 1980s when she and RonaldReagan set the themes for the decade under the control of Paul Volcker, the headof the Federal Reserve and the International Banking Commission. One of thepeople who did most to ensure that Margaret Thatcher became conservative partyleader in the 1970s was Sir Alfred Sherman, who would later be advisor to theSerbian leader Radovan Karadzic, the man responsible for so much suffering andhorror in the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. Thatcher was selected by theElite, possibly without her knowing what was really going on. But politiciansare only there to be used as appropriate to the plans of the Global Elite andshe outlived her welcome when she continued to oppose the removal of nationalsovereignty by the European Community through a European currency and centralbank. In May 1989, The Spotlight newspaper reported that the Bilderberg Groupmeeting on La Toja Island off Spain in that same month, had decided she had togo. A year later she was removed by her own MPs while still in office.Mrs Thatcher would not have been removed by people going to Conservative MPs andsaying: “Hey, the Bilderberg Group says she’s got to go.” It is much morecovert. The media is used to undermine the target, drip, drip, drip style, andunrest, doubts, and fears, are stimulated among ministers and MPs who want tokeep their jobs. The threat of losing their privilege because “We will never winthe next election with Margaret Thatcher as leader” is a wonderful way toconcentrate the minds of politicians to believe that “something must be done”. Amomentum is created which in the end makes the target politician’s removalinevitable. When, in Britain, we hear of the “men in grey suits” who decide whenthe leader of the Conservative Party will come and go, we are looking atElite/Brotherhood representatives within that party. Not top of the pyramidpeople, or anything like, but those who do as they are told when a change isdemanded. The same with other parties in other countries. There are so manyworld events I could list over the last 40 years that would all come back to thesame group.The UFO Cover-upThroughout the period since the war, reports by the public of UFOs have beencontinually dismissed by the authorities. They don’t exist, we are told. Aboutthe same time that the Warren Commission reported its covered-up version of theKennedy assassination, the Condon Report came out which did a similar job onUFOs. It said there was nothing about the phenomena worth investigating. If thatis the case, why are the files on UFO reports designated at ‘above top secret’?Because this is probably the biggest cover-up of them all, that’s why. Acover-up of the truth that the American elite have flying saucer, anti-gravitytechnology which makes the Space Shuttle look like an antique, and tosmokescreen the fact that extraterrestrials are visiting this planet from theFourth Dimension. This whole area is a minefield of disinformation and we needto keep a very open and flexible mind here, especially as the UFO investigationfield will have been seriously infiltrated by those who wish to deflect us. Butthere are now an average of 150 reported UFO sightings a day. If you accept theclaim that only ten per cent of sightings are reported, that’s more like 1,500 aday, across the world. They can’t all be flown by Earth humans and while theElite could use their craft to set up specific events to manipulate the humanmind, there are, in my view, also increasing numbers of true extraterrestrialsoperating on this dimension. Some are here to help, others to hinder thetransformation of humanity and Planet Earth. The latter are linked with theGlobal Elite, either by face-to-face contact, or via channelling andconsciousness control.I have presented a lot of evidence relating to UFOs in The Robots’ Rebellion,but there is much more available for those who wish to research further. What’sfor sure is that there is a whole library of information about UFOs andextraterrestrials which the public is not being told about, including thebackground to human abductions and the mutilation of cattle and other farmanimals all over the world, in ways that can only be done by technology notknown in the public arena. Either it is the work of extraterrestrials or of thehuman scientific elites at the underground bases in the United States (at placeslike Area S-4 near Groom Lake in Nevada and the Dulce facility in New Mexico).John Lear, a one-time pilot for the CIA, told a Dallas UFO Group in 1988:> “The nation has been brainwashed by a CIA mind-control operation based on fear> of ridicule. There have been at least one million abductees in the US since> 1947. In the last 13 years, there have been over 40,000 cattle mutilations in> the US. There are approximately 70 alien civilisations known to be visiting us> at the present time.> “Gordon Cooper, one of our very best astronauts, lost his chance to go on the> Apollo flights because he dared to speak out about UFOs in a letter to the> United Nations. During the past few years, there has been a steep increase in> the number of missing persons. It is estimated that there are about ten> million of the Grays [an alleged ET race] in bases on the Earth and Moon, but> it is not known whether they are able to return to their home base. They enter> and exit their underground bases through interdimensional transference, a> hyperspace manoeuvre which accounts for the apparently nonsensical stories of> UFO witnesses who report having seen UFOs going in or out of mountains. Those> witnesses are truthfully describing a manoeuvre that is at present> incomprehensible to our science.> “It was President Eisenhower who allowed the reins of power to pass from the> hands of the President into the control of the Pentagon. Ever since> Eisenhower, the real rulers of this nation have been a military junta.” 94Again Lear’s claims may be disinformation. But the themes cross-check with anenormous number of other reports (which, of course, might also bedisinformation). I am now certain to my own satisfaction that the human form wascreated by extraterrestrials; that negatively-inspired ETs from the FourthDimension have sought to control this planet throughout known history by actualappearances and (mostly) by controlling the consciousness of those humansoperating within a negative frequency range; that those who have conspired toinstall the New World Order since ancient times have been puppets of thesebeings (quite possibly, in part, the “Melchedekans” or “Elohim”) and the sameapplies to the Global Elite of today. I feel that contact has probably takenplace between the Elite and certain negative ET races, and the most unspeakablegenetic experiments are being carried out in the underground bases around theworld, especially in the United States, on those who are written off as ‘missingpersons’. The Nazi mentality is alive and well and controlling America under thedirection of an extraterrestrial consciousness which is the Nazi mentality. Ibelieve that these ETs of the Fourth Dimension feed off negative human emotion.They feed off the energies of fear, guilt, and misery, and therefore seek toincrease our pain and sense of fear and hopelessness, both for nourishment andto diminish our sense of worth and potential, thus making it easier to controlthe vibratory prison. When we love and respect ourselves, we cut off the foodsupply and open our minds and hearts to breach the blocking vibration. This wecan and will do.The reason for the UFO cover-up is to keep information from us about othercivilisations and worlds that would open people to a far greater perspective oflife and Creation, and to keep hidden the Global Pyramid of manipulation which(at its highest levels) is knowingly in contact with – and guided by – anegative force from another dimension. The number of scientists and computerprogrammers in the UK and the USA working with advanced technology who have metstrange, unexplained, deaths is ridiculous. Most have been written offas…‘suicide’. One after the other has died, many of them linked to the Star Warsproject and Marconi, a subsidiary of General Electric in the UK. If the Elite dohave ‘flying saucer’, anti-gravity craft (and I believe they certainly do), ortechnology in the ‘defence’ field they wish no-one to know about, it is justsuch scientists and computer programmers who might know about it, either byaccident or design. Maybe they found out too much about that or the technologylinked to Star Wars, which may really be part of the global electroniccommunications network designed to monitor billions of microchipped people. Eachmysterious death has been claimed to be unconnected to the others, under thefamiliar lone-assassin-no-conspiracy-type approach. Secret technology is puttogether under the rules of compartmentalisation. Each company or scientist onlyworks on part of the project. Only a tiny few know how each part fits togetherto produce the finished article.95One of the most famous scientific victims of the Elite was Dr Wilhelm Reich, whodied in a federal penitentiary in 1957 while the authorities destroyed all hiswork they could find. His organs were removed at an ‘autopsy’ and were neverseen again. Reich’s last book was called Contact With Space, which detailed hisUFO research. He understood how the Earth reflects the human mind and herecognised the barrenness and desertification of once beautiful landscapes asthe result of humanity’s emotional barrenness. He identified the lifeforceenergies, which he termed orgone energy. He labelled positive energy ‘OR’ andthe negative ‘DOR’. Reich believed that a particularly virulent form of negativeenergy, which he called Melanor, was emitted by some of the extraterrestrialspacecraft he said were visiting the planet. This Melanor took the form of ablack powder-type substance which “smelled like dead bodies”. This has beenmentioned in a number of stories by people claiming to have seen UFOs.Reich said that by using the knowledge of positive orgone energy, the lifeforce,he and his small team had grown grass to knee height in the Arizona desert,where it had never grown before in modern times. He also realised that thisenergy could be harnessed to provide ‘free energy’ for all the warmth and powerwe need, without pollution and (virtually) cost free.This is what could be happening all over the world if the knowledge of how to doit were not suppressed. The ‘unsolvable’ problems of this world are onlyunsolvable because the solutions are kept from us. Throughout his career in theUnited States after fleeing Nazi Germany, Reich was harassed by what he calledthe ‘hoodlums in government’, the ‘higs’. He developed a weapon which, he said,made UFOs disappear and he discovered how to change the weather and make it rainin the desert. This was only a technological extension of what the NativeAmericans could do with their rain dances. They were both utilising the sameenergies. In Contact With Space, the book that helped to speed the end of hislife, Reich was getting close to the truth. He wrote:> “Am I a spaceman? Do I belong to a new race on Earth, bred by men from outer> space in embraces with Earth women? Are my children offspring of the first> interplanetary race? Has the melting pot of interplanetary society already> been created on our planet, as the melting pot of all nations was established> in the USA 190 years ago? Or does this thought relate to things to come in the> future? I request my right and privilege to have such thoughts and to ask such> questions without being threatened to be jailed by any administrative agency> of society…In the face of a rigid, doctrinaire, self-appointed, ready-to-kill> hierarchy of scientific censorship it appears foolish to publish such> thoughts.

We should not yield our right> to well-controlled speculation. It is certain questions entailed in such> speculation which the administrators of established knowledge fear…But in> entering the cosmic age we should certainly insist on the right to ask new,> even silly questions without being molested.” 96Sadly, for Reich, the freedom he so rightly proclaimed was denied to him, as ithas been for so many others who have been killed for the crime of acquiringknowledge of science and UFOs which the Elite and theirextraterrestrial/Luciferic masters wish to remain hidden. His fellow‘scientists’ looked on as he was crucified. It is even speculated that anotherreason President Kennedy was killed was that he found out about the ETs andpledged to make the information public. In 1965, a leading journalist, DorothyKilgallen, was investigating both the UFO cover-up and the Kennedyassassination. She said in her column in the Los Angeles Examiner of May 22nd1965, that she had met “a high British official of cabinet rank” in London whohad told her that British scientists had examined a crashed UFO crewed by smallmen, less than four feet tall.97 In the same year, she interviewed Jack Ruby ina Dallas jail. Ruby, the man who killed the ‘patsy’, Lee Harvey Oswald, told hersomething which, she told close friends, “would blow the Kennedy case sky high.”Within days she was found dead. Verdict: suicide. Her friends searched herapartment for the notes of her meeting with Ruby. None were found.98The UFO scene is awash with disinformation and that means there is somethinggoing on which those in power don’t want the public to know. I believe there isa scenario in which a threat from an extraterrestrial force is hyped up by theGlobal Elite to the point where public terror will allow them to install a worldgovernment and army. This was one of the suggestions in the Report From IronMountain. I have no doubt, as I said in The Robots’ Rebellion, that at leastsome abductions attributed to ‘aliens’ are actually carried out by humans aspart of a mind manipulation and microchipping operation. The Rockefellers (viabillionare Laurance Rockefeller) have been linked with the ‘research’ intoextraterrestrials.99As this book was being completed, I was approached with information about whatwas claimed to be a mass mind manipulation policy on the people of the UnitedKingdom, headed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in America with theblessing of the British authorities. This has involved among other things thestaging of ‘UFO’ sightings, ‘alien’ abductions, and the microchipping of people,including some of those involved in UFO research. I want to know a lot moreabout this to see if it checks out. If you know something and you would like totalk to an open mind, please contact me.One thing’s for sure from where I am sitting: there is an underground facilityconnected with RAF Rudloe Manor in Wiltshire, England, which the British peopleought to know about, and the same goes for places like the top secret MountWeather underground city near the little town of Bluemont, Virginia, about 46miles west of Washington D.C. Some of the things you see in the James Bond filmsare not all fiction. Neither of these facilities, or the others, are operatingin the interests of the people. Mount Weather is likely to be a centre fromwhere the parallel government of the United States, the one that really runs thecountry, coordinates its operation. It is also the place which supervises thesurveillance of Americans who challenge the tyranny. Congress, the ‘elected’representatives of the people, has been refused any information about what goeson there. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the free world.The same Hidden Hand which was behind the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, the Kennedy,King and Malcolm X assassinations, Watergate, Iran-Contra, terrorist bombings,and the demise of Margaret Thatcher, is also responsible for the disinformationand cover-ups over UFOs and extraterrestrials. On the surface, these often verydifferent subjects and events appear to be unconnected, while they were – andare – coordinated by one force: the Global Elite, controlled by the FourthDimensional Prison Warders of the Luciferic Consciousness. But the truth aboutUFOs, whatever that may turn out to be, is not far from being known, and theveil is lifting on so much that has been kept secret across the generations.This is the time when the hidden will be revealed and the cause of themanipulation removed.When the Elite network has been dismantled in our lifetimes, what a differentworld this will be. For it is this which is behind the global conflicts, thetrafficking in hard drugs to young people, and the minute-by-minute abuse ofwhat we call democracy and freedom. Yet still the mass of the people allow theirminds to be misled like bewildered rabbits caught in the headlights of anoncoming car.I have sketched out the mere bones (or should I say the skull and bones) ofGeorge Bush’s career up to 1989. I have not even mentioned his endless businessdealings, or the number of times his business associates found themselvesappointed to the government payroll. That would take many chapters in itself,but the information is all there and I recommend the book, George Bush, TheUnauthorised Biography, if you wish to know more. He has been a constant themein the New World Order for over forty years. You have read some of hisbackground and the way his hand was symbolically holding a smoking gun when someterrible events were unfolding. So what did the American people do about it?I’ll tell you.They made him president.> SOURCES> > > 1 There is more to know about the JFK film and Oliver Stone, as we> > > shall see shortly> > > 2 The Spotlight (December 11th 1995) p3> > > 3 When CBS News presenter, Dan Rather, saw the Zapruder film for the> > > first time, he raced to the CBS studio to appear live on the news and> > > announce to the nation that it confirmed the official view of events.

Every few seconds it came to a junction andhad a choice of going left or right. The mouse thought it was free to gowherever it wished, but in fact the choices were strictly controlled. Itsfreedom was an illusion.The human race today has allowed itself to be like that mouse in the tubes. Themultidimensional manipulators are very clever in their use of buzz words. Theylink them together to create an accepted meaning, which is often the opposite ofthe real situation. If you say something often enough, people will believe it.The word ‘freedom’ has been equated with ‘democracy’, and democracy is equatedwith the parliamentary systems of government in the ‘free world’. We areprogrammed to see the three elements of freedom-democracy-parliament as the samething. They are not. The ‘democratic’ systems are part of the smokescreendesigned to fool us. If you know you live in an authoritarian regime whichcontrols your thoughts and behaviour, the media, and the economic highs andlows, the desire for freedom in the human heart will eventually rebel againstthis. People are much easier to control and suppress if this is done while theygo on thinking they are free. Such is the nature of our ‘democracy’.We can take the example of Westminster, this Mother of Parliaments, to see whata phoney democracy we have. Most Members of Parliament are not elected by thepeople, but by the committee or members of their constituency party! The UnitedKingdom parliamentary system is made up of constituencies which return an MP toparliament at the General Election. But only a relative few of theseconstituencies are ‘marginal’ in that the outcome is in doubt. Most are eitheroverwhelmingly Conservative or Labour. The public are mind-controlled to believethat their income should decide whom they vote for. The Conservatives have the‘image’ of low taxation and voting Conservative is, for many – depressingly many– just another part of their social status. Detached house, two cars, vote Tory.In the poor and deprived areas, many of which have been devastated by thepeople-are-numbers housing policies of Labour governments and councils, themajority vote Labour because “they’re the party of the working classes”. Yes,they are the party which sees economic success as more people standing for eighthours a day next to a factory machine, or a mile underground in a coal mine.These rigid mindsets mean that constituencies which are mostly affluent returnConservative MPs, no matter how competent or otherwise the person with the bluerosette may be; and in the poor areas, the one with the red rosette, whoever heor she may be, will become the Member of Parliament.In these constituencies – the overwhelming majority – the would-be MP only hasto persuade the local party members to select him or her to stand at theelection and they are virtually certain to be elected to Parliament. It is whatthey call being selected to stand in a “safe seat”. So if the Elite want someoneto be elected to further the New World Order, it is no problem. Find them one ofthe endless safe seats and they are in. Even if an MP with his or her own mindslips through the net, they will be told how to vote by their party or facesanctions against them, like a block on their advancement or, as in the case ofthe Conservative MPs opposed to further integration into the European Union,suspension from the party. This is democracy, Elite-style, because it was theywho created the parliamentary structure after the power of the monarchies wascurtailed or removed by the ‘people’s’ revolutions. If our new MP does as he orshe is told, they may advance into government or even be Prime Minister. Morethan that, if they are clones of the Elite, the advancement can be very quick.In the United States, I understand, there are still some people who believe thatthe public select the president. If only it were true. Two things select thepresident: money and the media. The Elite controls both. You need fantasticamounts of money to run for the presidential nomination within your own party,never mind the presidency itself. To do that you need silly money. Only thebanking/business establishment has those resources and their money goes to theone they want. Sometimes it also goes to a candidate they know has no chance ofwinning because that makes sure that his opponent – the one they really want –will be the next occupant of the White House. Add to this the media coveragewhich supports one candidate and undermines the other, and you have a riggedelection promoted as the democratic process. Once the candidate is elected, itis pay back time. They who pay the piper call the tune.Certain legislation and an agreement to select certain people in the mainpositions within the administration are arranged before the election funds beginto flow. Give David Rockefeller a call and ask him who the next president isgoing to be. He’ll know by now. The background staff are far more powerful thana prime minister or president if they work in concert. They don’t have to bepopular because the public don’t know they exist or what they do. But thepoliticians do have to court popularity, particularly at election time. Thismakes them easy prey for those in the background. We have a television comedyprogramme in the UK called Yes, Minister, which involves a civil servantmanipulating a minister to do exactly as he wants. It is very funny, but in thereality of the political system, such manoeuvring is deadly serious.The politicians and the media perpetuate an illusion and so divert attentionfrom those who truly run the world. The politicians give the impression thatthey have the power, and the media supports this gigantic myth by reportingevents and decisions as if the politicians were the ultimate sanction. Hour byhour we have the presidents, prime ministers, and their underlings, pictured andquoted. We see them meeting at ‘summits’ and issuing statements about eventsover which they have little or no power. But the public have to be persuaded bythe media that ‘elected’ politicians are the global decision makers. If we don’taccept that illusion, we start to ask questions about who does, therefore,control events. The media report the world as if politicians are at the top ofthe pyramid, when they are only the puppets, trigger-pullers, and mouthpiecesfor those who are really at the top. As a result, those who control our livescan stay in the shadows while those who only appear to be in power areconstantly in the spotlight. The diversion is brilliantly orchestrated.[../Images/00011.jpg]Figure 15It is vital for those of us who live in the ‘democracies’ to realise that we do,in truth, live in a One Party State. When we appreciate that, we will stoplooking to politicians to tell us what to do and start thinking and acting forourselves. We will stop believing that by voting for a different party atelection time we will change anything of substance. Politicians of whateverparty are not going to change the world because they are just pawns. We all haveto take that responsibility and stop handing it over to “them”, the politicians,economists, and anyone else who will have it. The illusion that we have a‘choice’ of who governs us will continue to persuade us to give ourresponsibility away unless we get wise to the fact that we don’t have thatchoice.All political movements are controlled by the same force (Figure 15). If youhave two main parties from which the government is chosen each time and theyvote the same way on all the legislation that really matters, there is no‘choice’ for the elector. This is the case with the Democratic and RepublicanParties in America. The USA, this home of ‘freedom’ as the presidents areconstantly telling us, is a One Party State. So is the United Kingdom. There isno fundamental difference between the Labour and Conservative Parties. It isimpossible to vote for a party in Britain which has any chance of forming agovernment that is not in favour of further centralisation of power in Europe,with one currency and a central bank. I am sure you will find the same themesall over the world. When people point to other, smaller, parties, offering anapparent alternative, they are missing the point. If the parties who have anychance of winning agree on the fundamentals, elections become an irrelevance, afarce.What confuses people is the way that politicians who are working to the sameends appear in public and even privately among their colleagues and friends, tobe promoting very different, sometimes opposite, attitudes to life. This allowsthem to appear to be opponents when they are really on the same side. Dr KittyLittle, a researcher into the infiltration of British politics and intelligenceagencies for more than 50 years, explained the technique in her booklet, TreasonAt Westminster:> “It is probable that some of those infiltrators who have in the last 20 years> reached the top of the Labour and Conservative parties, had training in the> art of concealing their true opinions. Fuchs [the German physicist who worked> on the atomic bomb project] has described his formal instruction in what he> called ‘controlled schizophrenia’, and even boasted that when drunk he could> retain his assumed character with the political opinions of those with whom he> worked. Similarly another member of the [subversive] organisation, Philby [Kim> Philby, the spy] wrote: ‘I will conclude by mentioning a factor which has> unnecessarily puzzled some western commentators on my case.

Another comment from a personal> friend was that I could not have maintained such a consistently> liberal-intellectual framework unless I had really believed in it. Both> remarks are very flattering. The first duty of an underground worker is to> perfect not only his cover story, but his cover personality.’” 1When we look at the apparently ‘different’ political views, we are so oftenlooking at a façade. A series of people wearing masks to hide their realintentions and opinions. Behind the mask are the Global Elite and the All-SeeingEye, and it is this ‘democratic’ masquerade2 which acts as the smokescreen forthe One Party States.America’s One Party StateNothing makes this more obvious than the example of George Bush and BillClinton, two apparent ‘opponents’. One is a Republican, the other a Democrat,but both are controlled by the same group. Both are frontmen for the One PartyState and they are connected by the Council on Foreign Relations, the TrilateralCommission, Freemasonry, drugs, murder, Iran-Contra, the Bank of Credit andCommerce International (BCCI), their support for the invasion of sovereignstates, centralised institutions, the GATT agreement, the North American FreeTrade Area (NAFTA), the Gulf War…on and on it goes.Bush swept to victory against Michael Dukakis in 1988 on a tidal wave of Elitemoney. Henry Kissinger’s presence was again at the heart of the Bush governmentwith two members of his company, Kissinger Associates, taking leading roles.They were Brent Scowcroft, head of the Kissinger Associates Washington office,and Lawrence Eagleburger, the president of the company. Scowcroft was directorof the national security council and Eagleburger, the undersecretary at theState Department. A founding board member of Kissinger Associates, LordCarrington, was Secretary-General of NATO from 1984 to 1988. Quite a line up forone company! Bush also promoted the Elite strategy of ‘saving’ the environment,just as Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil) and Al Gore (CFR) would do. On the otherside of the Atlantic, exactly in tandem, Margaret Thatcher (Bil), turned amental somersault and began to proclaim the need to protect the environmentafter once calling environmental campaigners “the enemy within”. The word“drugs” is also a constant theme which links the Bush and Clinton presidencies.Drugs are a massive form of income for the Elite and a front-line weapon in thedestabilisation of society. We shall look first at the Republican wing of theOne Party State in the form of Mr George Bush.The Invasion of PanamaThe Bush attack on Panama on December 20th 1989, was connected with drugs,though not in the way it was portrayed by the government and the media. This isanother fine example of how the truth of a situation is submerged in politicalrhetoric and media camouflage. We are told that American troops invaded Panamaand abducted President Manuel Noriega because of his drug running activities andto save American children from the evil of drugs. There is a chance that thevery opposite is the case. Noriega was on the payroll of the CIA while Bush wasthe Director and he was being paid some $110,000 a year for his ‘services’,which included running drugs. When Bush was challenged about this after theinvasion of Panama, he said he had never met Noriega, but then suddenlyremembered the meeting. Noriega was involved in the drugs market and riggedelections, but the American government and the CIA knew that when they employedhim. The 1984 Panama election was won by Arnulfo Arias, but Noriega took powerwith a mixture of extreme violence and fraud. President Ronald Reagan thendispatched Secretary of State George Shultz (CFR, TC, Bil, Comm 300), to givelegitimacy to Noriega and even to declare that Panama’s democratic principleswere a lesson to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua!The Bush-Noriega relationship began to change during the Iran-Contra period,according to Noriega, when he was visited by Admiral John Poindexter, the headof the National Security Council, on December 17th 1985. Poindexter wasprosecuted for his part in Iran-Contra. Noriega told CBS reporter Mike Wallacethat Poindexter demanded that he support the US war against the Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua. When he refused, Poindexter threatened economic warfareand the destabilisation of Panama. What Poindexter wanted was for Panama toinvade Nicaragua with American support, Noriega said.3 At no point was Noriega’salleged involvement in drugs mentioned. But the US Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) did contact him about drugs. They wrote to congratulate himon helping them to stop Panama being used as a drug and drug-money-launderingcentre!4 Just one month later, the Reagan-Bush administration demanded thatNoriega be removed on the grounds of drugs, corruption, and lack of democracy.The need for ‘democracy’ in Panama is an insult. Again Noriega was certainly nosaint, but the CIA have supported, and imposed, some of the most grotesque farRight dictatorships across the world to suit their own agenda, including thefinancing of terrorists to murder women and children by the thousands.It is not easy working out the motivations of the Drug EnforcementAdministration, because within it are people committed to stopping the flow ofdrugs into America and others equally determined to increase it. A number of DEAand CIA operatives have described how some officials of the Drug EnforcementAdministration are involved in expanding the availability of hard drugs in theUnited States. Noriega’s former chief advisor, Jose Blandon, has claimed thatthe DEA has protected the biggest players in the drug empires and that DEAofficials paid Noriega $4.7 million to keep quiet. In February 1988, Noriega wasindicted on drugs charges, all but one of which related to activities before1984, when he was on the CIA payroll! Economic sanctions against Panama followed– the economic warfare which Poindexter had promised. If Noriega had agreed tosupport the US war with Nicaragua, or hadn’t fallen out with Bush in some way,he would still be dictator of Panama instead of being in a US jail.When Bush became president, he made the ludicrous statement that Panama posed an“unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security and foreign policy.US News And World Report said on May 1st 1989 that Bush had authorised $10million in CIA expenditure on projects against the Panamanian government. Someof the money was delivered by the CIA’s Carlos Eleta Almaran, who had recentlybeen arrested for drug trafficking. Those charges were ordered to be dropped byBush after Noriega was ousted. By December 20th 1989, with Noriega still theredespite the CIA’s best efforts, US forces invaded Panama. Hundreds, perhapsthousands of civilians, including children, were killed. Noriega was abducted toAmerica for trial and sentence on drug charges. The rest of the ‘free’ world,including Britain’s Margaret Thatcher, offered not a word of protest. The judgeat his trial refused to allow any CIA documents to be seen in his defence and hewas sentenced to 40 years for running drugs.What would the government and CIA officials get if they came to trial! They’dhave to reincarnate a number of times to complete the sentence. When you observethe background to Noriega’s arrest, it is extremely relevant to know that themen the Bush regime imposed on the people of Panama to replace Noriega wereclosely connected with the money laundering, drug trafficking, business. The newpresident, Guillermo Endara, was an official of at least six banks involved indrug-money-laundering. The money laundered through these sources came from theColombian drug smuggling ring led by Augusto Falcon and Salvador Magluta, whowere reported to be smuggling one ton of cocaine a month into Florida from thelate 1970s until 1987.5 The new vice president of Panama installed by Bush wasRicardo Arias Calderon, whose brother was president of the First InternamericasBank when it was controlled by the Cali drug cartel. Official figures show thatdrug trafficking and money laundering in Panama after Noriega has been greaterthan it was when he was there. One of those captured by the invading US forceswas the Mossad agent, Michael “Freddy” Harari, who, with other operatives likeDavid Kimche, worked with the CIA on behalf of Mossad with the Medellin and Calidrug cartels. He was allowed to escape in an Israeli jet because, if he had beenput on trial, the whole CIA-Mossad drug operation would have been blown.6The War on DrugsGeorge Bush became America’s ‘Mr War on Drugs’. Hard to believe when you see thecompany he kept and the operations he was involved in during Iran-Contra and theinvasion of Panama. Bush is a global drug trafficker!He led ‘anti-drug’ campaigns during the Nixon and Reagan presidencies andanother during his own. None of them worked, and, in the words of CongressmanGlenn English, his war on drugs was “little more than lip service and pressreleases”. One of these claimed that his South Florida Task Force, set up underReagan, had ended the marijuana trade in South Florida. This was an outrageousclaim, but when Francis Mullen Jr, of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),challenged the statement, he was sacked. Bush even used the CIA to arrange drug‘busts’ that were designed to give the public the impression that he wassucceeding. CIA operative, Trenton Parker, has told how the Colombian drugdealers each donated cocaine which was landed at Miami International Airport inMarch 1980 and left in a place where it would be found by customs officials.7This is often done to give the illusion of success. On other occasions the smallfry are targeted while the major players, with their links to the highest levelsof world politics and intelligence, are allowed to ply their trade unmolested.Only rarely do genuine officials apprehend the big names. Even then it can bebecause they have outlived their usefulness to the manipulators. Parker alsodescribed how it was the CIA who called together the top Colombian drug dealersfor two meetings in late 1981 under the Reagan-Bush administration to form acartel to improve the shipment of drugs into the United States. The firstmeeting, he said, took place at the Hotel International in Medellin, attended byabout 200 drug dealers. The now infamous Medellin Cartel was officially createdin December 1981.8 The CIA formed the Colombian drug cartels? Yes. But, then,what is amazing anymore?Nothing of substance that Bush promised in his various drug ‘campaigns’ was everdelivered and, more than that, the revelations of his links with drug dealerscontinue to mount, as they do with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. We havealready seen the Shackley-Gregg-Rodriguez connections through the Iran-Contraarms-for-drugs scandal when more – not fewer – hard drugs were brought into theUnited States to further destabilise American society. For fourteen years Bushwas also a friend of Don Aronow, who (according to one published account9 and anumber of other researchers) was connected with the Meyer Lansky crimesyndicate, drug running and drug money laundering. Then there is the Zapata OilCorporation, which was set up by George Bush. This company was a CIA front andthat its subsidiary, Zapata Offshore, was implicated in drug smuggling whileBush was its top man. Michael Maholy, who worked for the State Department andthe CIA for two decades, said that drugs were brought by sea to the ZapataOffshore rigs, unloaded, and then flown ashore in the helicopters, constantlycarrying goods and personnel between the rigs and the American mainland. He saidhe saw this happening and confirmed it through the cables that he handled.Maholy said the ships of a company called Pacific Seafood were used to ferry thedrugs between countries.10It is a big mental leap, I know, to appreciate that the world market in illegalhard drugs is controlled and supervised by Elite elements within organisationslike the CIA and British Intelligence, which are supposed to be there to protectsociety from the consequences of hard drug addiction. But there it is. Nothingis ever what it seems. It has been accepted that the CIA experimented with LSDbefore it was promoted as the ‘freedom’ drug of the 1960s. The Elite have beeninvolved in the manipulation of society through drugs for a very long time. Itgoes back many centuries and reached a new peak with the Opium Wars againstChina in 1840 and 1858, when Chinese efforts to stop the flow of opium intotheir country were thwarted by the might of the British Empire. Queen Victoria’sPrime Minister, who was involved in both wars, was Lord Palmerston, the GrandPatriarch or Master of Grand Orient (Illuminati) Freemasonry and a member of theCommittee of 300. The vehicle for this trade in opium from India to China andelsewhere was the East India Company, a group of Scottish merchants who werealigned with the Knights of St John of Jerusalem and the Society of Jesus (theJesuits). Some researchers believe that the company’s real masters were thebanking families of northern Italy, the Black Nobility.11The strategy used by the British in China has become a blueprint forinvasion-by-drug-addiction ever since. They sponsored a mass addiction to opiumuntil Chinese society and vitality was torn asunder. The British government useda network of terrorism and organised crime, like the Triads, the Hong Society,and the Assassins, to carry out the trade on their behalf. When the Chineserulers reacted to stop the supply, the British used their military and navalmight to defeat them. And the ‘peace’ treaty after the conflict then gave theBritish a guaranteed right to increase the flow of opium; to be paidcompensation for the opium the Chinese rulers had confiscated; and to havesovereignty over strategic ports and offshore islands. This is how Hong Kongcame under British rule. It was used as the centre for Far East drug traffickingand that is still its role today.Most of the gold and money transactions on the Hong Kong financial markets arethe pay-offs and money laundering of the drug trade. The Treaty of Nanking of1842 gave Britain control over Hong Kong, plus $21 million in silver. It waswritten by the colonial minister, Edward Bulwer-Lytton (Comm 300), whosewritings were to so inspire Hitler, the Nazis, and others such as MadameBlavatsky. His son was the Viceroy of India at the height of the opium tradebetween India and China, a period camouflaged by the writings of Rudyard Kiplingabout the British Raj (British drug runners). In the book, The Opium Clippers,Basil Lubbock names the owners of the British vessels engaged in the opium tradeas the East India Company; Jardine Matheson; Dent and Co; Pybus Bros; Russelland Co; Cama Bros; Duchess of Atholl; the Earl of Balcarras; King George IV, ThePrince Regent; The Marquis of Camden; and Lady Melville. It was Lady Melville’sancestor, George, who welcomed William of Orange to the throne and was made LordPrivy Seal.After the second opium war, which ended in 1860, the British merchant banks andtrading companies established the Hong Kong and Shanghai Corporation as thecentral bank of the Far East drug industry. According to all research I haveread about the drug network, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, with its globalconnections, continues to be a financial centre for the drug industry to thisday.12 So was the Nugan Hand Bank (based in Sydney, Australia), anotherCIA/Mossad operation run by Francis Nugan and Michael Hand, a Green Beret and acolonel in the US Army assigned to the CIA. Hand was in frequent contact withGeorge Bush after his election to vice president, according to CIA operative,Trenton Parker.13Look at some principal officers of Nugan Hand: Admiral Earl F. Yates, President,chief of staff for strategic planning of US forces in Asia and the Pacificduring the Vietnam War; General Edwin F. Black, President of the Hawaii branch,the commander of US troops in Thailand during the Vietnam conflict; GeorgeFarris, operative with the Washington and Hong Kong branches, a militaryintelligence specialist; Bernie Houghton, the Saudi Arabia representative, a USNaval Intelligence undercover agent; Thomas Clines, of Nugan Hand in London, adirector of training in the CIA’s clandestine service who was involved inIran-Contra and operated with Michael Hand and Theodore Shackley during Vietnam;Dale Holmgreen, of the Taiwan office, flight service manager in Vietnam forCivil Air Transport which later became the infamous CIA airline, Air America;Walter McDonald, head of the Annapolis, Maryland, branch, the former deputydirector of CIA economic research; General Roy Manor, the Philippine branch, thechief of staff for the US Pacific command and the US government’s liaison withPresident Ferdinand Marcos; William Colby, Nugan Hand’s lawyer, a formerdirector of the CIA.14Just the kind of people you would expect to be running a bank, eh? Well, atleast they would be, if you wanted your bank manager to give you advice onrunning covert operations and training terrorists. A director of Nugan Hand,Donald Beazley, was chairman of City National Bank of Miami, which handled fundsfor the Anti-Defamation League.15 Michael Hand was found dead in his MercedesBenz in the late 1970s on a remote road outside Sydney. He had ‘shot himself’.It was a remarkable suicide in that he had pulled the trigger and then, beforehe died, he must have wiped all his fingerprints off the gun because none werefound. An Australian government investigation revealed that millions of dollarsin Nugan Hand records were unaccounted for and that it was serving as a moneylaundering operation for drug traffickers. These profits were being used by theCIA to finance gun smuggling, and illegal covert operations around the world.There was also evidence that the CIA was using the bank to pay for politicalcampaigns against politicians in many countries, including Australia, to ensurethe voters supported the CIA choice. Yes, this is still the ‘free’ world we aretalking about.Banks with household names across the world are vehicles for laundering drugmoney as it passes from account to account until its origins are lost in the webof transactions. The gold and diamond industries, dominated by the Rothschildsand the Oppenheimers through companies like DeBeers, are also used to wash drugmoney. The money buys gold or diamonds from those companies and then they aresold to produce ‘clean’ money. The network of interconnecting Anglo-Americanfamilies in the Elite web of manipulation, who have been responsible for theengineering of conflict and economic depression through the generations, arealso behind the world illegal drugs market.16 Some of the most famous names,merchant banks, and companies in the world are making a good slice of theirfortunes directly or indirectly from the drug addiction of the young. We areentering the time when those people will have to face that responsibilitypublicly as part of their eternal evolution and the public are going to beastonished at some of those involved.The same families and organisations were responsible for the slave trade andalcohol prohibition. The latter was a means to create the massive network oforganised crime in the United States. The structure thus produced was perfect,as intended, for drug trafficking once Prohibition was over. The main groupscampaigning for Prohibition and an end to the “evils of drink”, groups like theWomen’s Christian Temperance Union and its Anti-Saloon League, were financed bythe Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Warburgs via the Rockefeller Foundation, theRussell Sage Foundation, and similar tax-exempt foundations. Prohibition wasanother con by the Elite used for longer-term motives. Incidentally, it alsomade a fortune for Joseph Kennedy, the father of JFK.Professor Alfred McCoy’s 1972 classic, The Politics Of Heroin In South EastAsia, and his 1991 update, The Politics Of Heroin – CIA Complicity In The GlobalDrug Trade, tell of how CIA helicopters in Vietnam were carrying drugs from thefields to the distribution points, when the American public thought they werethere to fight ‘communism’. He describes how a Pepsi Cola bottling plant wasused for this trade and how the media suppressed this information. 58,000Americans and goodness knows how many Vietnamese were killed in that conflictand nothing sums up more powerfully the lack of respect this mindset has forhuman life than the way the CIA smuggled drugs into America in plastic bagshidden in the body cavities of the dead soldiers being returned home for burialfrom Vietnam. CIA operative, Gunthar Russbacher, has told how some bodies weregutted and filled with drugs for shipment back to the States.17 The bodiescarried secret codes which allowed those carrying the drugs to be identified onarrival at West Coast airbases, particularly the Travis Air Force Base inCalifornia. The drugs were then removed and made available for the young peopleof America.One man who had his eyes opened to all this during the Bush presidency wasLieutenant Colonel James “Bo” Gritz, one of America’s most decorated soldiers,with sixty-two citations for valour, five Silver Stars, eight Bronze Stars, twoPurple Hearts, and a Presidential Citation. My outlook on life and that of BoGritz could hardly be further apart, but his experiences deserve to be heard byanyone who thinks that government is still – or ever was – ‘for’ and ‘by’ thepeople. In an address to the American Liberty Lunch Club, recorded on the video,A Nation Betrayed, Gritz describes how he twice visited a man called Khun Sa,who was the recognised “overlord” of heroin trafficking in the Golden Triangleof the Far East. Heroin is a derivative of opium. Gritz became involved when hewas told that the release of US prisoners of war (still being held after theconflicts in Laos) was being stopped by American government officials involvedin drug trafficking. He found this to be correct. The government did not wantthe prisoners released because they knew about their officials’ involvement inthe drug trade and might talk about it when they returned home. Kuhn Sa and hisoperatives in the Golden Triangle told Gritz about some of the Americans theyhad worked with in the past. They named Theodore Shackley, whom George Bushappointed to a top job in the CIA and used as a ‘speech writer’. They alsolisted Richard Armitage, then a US Embassy official and later on the campaignstaff of Ronald Reagan, who appointed him the assistant secretary of defense. Nowonder there was so little interest in releasing US prisoners of war who couldblow the whole thing. Armitage is reported to be a close friend and advisor toColin Powell, the US Chief of Staff during the Gulf War, who was presented as apossible presidential candidate, standing as a self-styled “RockefellerRepublican”.18The Elite are involved in drugs for three main reasons. First to makeunthinkable amounts of money – billions per year – to finance covert operationsagainst elected governments and society in general. Drug profits produce moneywhich does not need to be channelled from government sources where it could betraced. Secondly, the ‘problem’ of drugs has produced (understandably) such areaction of “something must be done” that people are agreeing to the erosion ofrights and freedoms in a way that they never would unless there was a ‘solution’required to ‘stop’ the supply of drugs and its terrible effect on the structureof society. It also provides the US (Global Elite) with an excuse to intervenein the affairs of other countries. Thirdly, we have the opium-to-China syndrome.If you want to divide and rule and stop people manifesting their full potential,what better way of doing it than to get a significant section of the younggeneration (and many others besides) hooked on hard drugs? What the Britishprovably did to the Chinese is what the Elite is seeking to do to the youngpeople of the world, to sap their natural vitality, their sense of worth, andthe knowledge of their infinite potential to achieve anything they wish toachieve. The war on drugs is another phoney war. As Bo Gritz put it:> “No president that’s ever declared a war on drugs has ever fought one.” 19And Michael Levine, a former agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration,said that the war on drugs was the:> “…biggest, whitest, and deadliest lie ever perpetrated on US citizens by their> government.” 20And who have been the two frontmen for every “war on drugs” since the Nixonadministration? George Bush and Bill Clinton. We’ll hear more of Clinton’s drugactivities shortly.The Gulf WarGeorge Bush is an oilman. Much of his colossal fortune comes from oil and thosecompanies provided the bulk of his election funds. When Bush policies led to arise in the price of oil, both his income and that of the oil cartel went up byenormous amounts. It was the same for another oilman, James Baker, Bush’ssecretary of state. In the wider sense, the more the Arab oil producers could bedivided, the more power the United States, the British, and other industrialcountries would have over them. Conflict in the Middle East, which raises theprice of oil and causes turmoil and hostility within the Arab world, is good foroilmen and good for divide and rule. If you can arrange such conflict to involvea group of countries fighting under the United Nations flag, you areaccelerating the move to a world army under central global control – one of thefundamental aims of the New World Order. The Gulf War did all of these things.If Saddam Hussein, a close friend of Bush for many years, was not in on theplot, then he was brilliantly set up.In July 1990 Bush attended the NATO Summit at Lancaster House in London, chairedby the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Wörner, who (like his predecessor, LordCarrington) was a Bilderberger. Some researchers established that thepossibility of a new Middle East War was discussed and so was the deployment ofNATO forces outside their designated region, the so-called “out-of-area”deployment. From this Summit came the London Declaration which called for closercooperation between NATO and the countries of the former Soviet Union. This hassince evolved, as was always intended, into the policy of absorbing thosecountries into NATO as part of the world army strategy. The Elite is obviouslyanxious to make sure this absorption policy is adopted, because once NATO beginsto expand and operate outside Europe and the North Atlantic, it gets ever closerto being a world army. The idea is to extend NATO’s area of operations byinviting more countries to join and to engineer events using theproblem-reaction-solution strategy which lead to a fusion of NATO and the UN‘peacekeeping’ forces and the formation of the world army. This is thebackground from which the Gulf War needs to be viewed.Disputes between Iraq and Kuwait are not new. Kuwait has been under British andElite control back to the days when the economic potential of oil wasdiscovered. It is a dictatorship, an unpleasant one, and the idea that the GulfWar was to ‘free’ Kuwait is just ridiculous. If Kuwait is to be freed, thedictators of the Royal Family elites need to give up their power and the Britishmanipulation of that country and its people has to end. Saddam Hussein wasencouraged by the Americans and the British to go to war with Iran in 1980. Ifthe findings of some researchers are accurate, Saddam was led to believe byBritish and American Intelligence that the Khomeini regime was in such chaos,the war would be over quickly. They lied. It dragged on for eight years amidappalling suffering and loss of life. But it was good for the oil companies, thebanks, the armament companies, and divide and rule.The British government armed both sides in this conflict and some (but onlysome) of this scandal has surfaced through the Scott Inquiry into illegal armssales to Iraq. I wonder if this inquiry has heard of a company called MidlandIndustrial Trade Services, which is claimed to be the Midland Bank’s secret armsoperation. This is based, I am told, behind the façade of an ‘ordinary’ branchof the Midland in Victoria Street, Westminster, London SW1H 0NJ. I wonder alsoif the Scott Inquiry has heard any allegations that Midland Industrial TradeServices were introduced to the Iraqis by Kissinger Associates? I’m sure thereis nothing whatsoever in these rumours from very well informed sources. TheMidland Bank, that pillar of respectability, involved in secret arms sales? Thevery thought is ridiculous. Isn’t it?The Iran-Iraq war is a grotesque example of modified Hegelianism. The CIA lookedafter Khomeini during his exile in Paris to ensure he was ready and waiting totake over when the Shah, another CIA puppet, had outlived his usefulness. At thesame time, as The Wall Street Journal of August 16th 1990 reported, it was theCIA in 1968 who supported the Baath Party in Iraq and installed Saddam asdictator. Now Saddam would be used again, knowingly or otherwise, to start upanother war in the Gulf, another war planned long before. George C. Andrewsreports in his book, Extra-Terrestrial Friends And Foes:> “A little known fact about the Gulf War is that one month before our> Declaration of War on December 15th, 1990, Secretary of State, James Baker,> signed the US Army report from the 352nd Civil Affairs Command on the New> Kuwait [unclassified, and therefore available to those interested]. This> report describes in detail how extensively Kuwait will be destroyed, how the> oil wells will be set on fire, and then how it will all be rebuilt ‘better> than before’, with despotism, instead of democracy, even more strongly> entrenched than it had been before. The report includes a list of US> corporations who are to be assigned the profitable task of rebuilding Kuwait> and extinguishing the oil well fires, as well as the Arab names they will be> operating under.> “Why have none of his political opponents thought of asking the obvious> questions: How did George Bush’s so called ‘blind trust’ make out during the> time frame of the Gulf War? Why are the huge business deals between Bush and> Hussein still off-limits to the public’s right to know?” 21To readers of this book, the answers to those questions will be obvious. The‘blind trust’, by the way, is the farce which insists that presidents must handover all their business dealings to a trust during their term in office, whichis supposed to make sure that they can’t make political decisions which affecttheir own investments and companies. Do you believe it works like that? No, norme. Bush’s ‘blind trust’ was controlled by William Farish III, his close friendand grandson of William Farish, the President of Standard Oil of New Jersey whenthey were working with I.G. Farben and supplying Adolf Hitler. I will come toBush’s business links with Saddam shortly.American reconnaissance advised President Bush around July 16th and 17th 1990that Iraqi troops were assembling along the border with Kuwait. Nothing wasdone. On July 25th Saddam Hussein met with the US Ambassador in Baghdad, AprilGlaspie, who told him she was acting on the instructions of President Bush. Shesaid that the Bush government had “no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflict, likeyour border disagreement with Kuwait.”22 I wonder if the Argentine governmentwere told something similar before they invaded the Falklands? Glaspie addedthat she had instructions from the President to seek better relations with Iraq.She then left for a summer holiday, another indication to Saddam that theAmericans were disinterested in the whole thing.That date of July 25th is most significant because it was in the days beforethat, according to CIA and Naval Intelligence operative, Gunther Russbacher,that George Bush, Brent Scowcroft (Kissinger Associates), and other closeadvisors drew up an agreement to be submitted to President Gorbachev, throughwhich he would agree not to intervene if the United States invaded Iraq.Remember this was before Glaspie met with Saddam and while Bush was ignoring theIraqi troop buildups. Russbacher says he was briefed on the plan in mid-July byScowcroft and Bush’s CIA chief, William Webster. Russbacher was one of thepilots of four CIA SR-71s which flew to Moscow on July 26th from the CrowsLanding Naval Air Station in California, refuelling twice on the way. On boardwere Scowcroft and Webster. Russbacher, who spoke Russian, met with Gorbachevwho signed the agreement.23While all this was going on, Bush still had nothing to say in public about thetroops’ buildup along the Kuwaiti border. By July 31st perhaps 100,000 troopswere involved. Still Bush was silent. Two days before the invasion, John Kelly(CFR), an assistant secretary of state, was asked by a congressional hearing ifthe US would defend Kuwait in the event of an attack. He replied: “We have nodefense treaty with any Gulf country”.24 On August 2nd, Saddam invaded Kuwait.That same day, and again on August 6th, Bush met with Margaret Thatcher atAspen, Colorado, and at the White House. The British prime minister was, asusual, highly belligerent about the need to teach Saddam a lesson. HenryKissinger was behind the scenes, too, in the form of Brent Scowcroft, thenational security advisor, a long-time Kissinger aide back to the days of theNixon presidency, and an executive of Kissinger Associates. Scowcroft was urgingmilitary intervention. The Bush tone began to change. The Saudi Arabians weretold by the Americans that Saddam was likely to invade their country next –utter nonsense – and Bush ordered US troops to assemble along the ‘threatened’Saudi border. There would be no intervention, the world was told. The US forceswere only there to protect Saudi Arabia, Bush said. Economic sanctions were tobe the weapon used against Saddam. The Saudi Arabians, Germans, and Japanesewould be badgered into contributing large sums towards American costs.But sanctions were never going to be the real weapon. The rhetoric became everstronger. Bush labelled Saddam “the new Hitler” and he said that the SecondWorld War had shown that appeasement of such people was not the answer. He mighthave added that it also was not the answer to fund both sides at the same timeand to help finance Hitler’s war machine, as his father had done. For those whoknew the game plan, it was easy to see what was happening. On August 23rd,Kissinger’s man, Brent Scowcroft, said it all: “We believe we are creating thebeginning of a new world order out of the collapse of the US-Sovietantagonisms”.25 The term, the New World Order, would now be used by Bush andenter into political-speak around the world to the point of tedium. Bush (Comm300) received enthusiastic support from Margaret Thatcher and the FreemasonPresident of France, François Mitterrand (Comm 300), who both sent forces to theGulf to support the Americans. They presented themselves as a United Nationsforce. In effect, a world army. Bush said in a speech to Congress on September11th:> “Clearly no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie> concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of> nations has begun, and we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment.> The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare> opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these> troubled times, our fifth objective – a new world order – can emerge…” 26For ‘fifth’ read ‘first’. On November 8th, Bush announced that the forces inSaudi Arabia would be substantially increased. The ‘defensive’ force was now toswitch to offensive mode. A week later Bush left on a tour of Europe and theMiddle East gathering support for the invasion. He met for three hours withPresident Assad of Syria, a tool of the Elite, who pledged to increase hiscontribution to Bush’s forces to 20,000 men. The Bush ‘UN’ forces attacked onWednesday, January 16th. 120,000 air sorties were unleashed on Iraq, mostly, itturned out, against civilian areas. The operation was headed by Bush’s chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, a member of the Council on ForeignRelations, who has ancestral links with many old American and British families.Every allied supreme commander and US secretary of defense since the SecondWorld War has been a member of the CFR. The number of dead and injured from thebombing of Iraq, the resulting disease, and the continuing economic sanctionscan hardly be comprehended. Conditions for the innocent civilians in Iraq areterrible under the economic stranglehold, but the West looks on. So this is theUnited Nations in all its glory, this is the bastion of jaw, jaw, not war, war.This is the promoter of peace. This is the New World Order. The futurepresident, Bill Clinton, supported the Gulf War and the United Nations policy.There is another stunner in all this, too. The United States government fundedSaddam Hussein to fight the war against the United States and UN forces! It wasdone through a branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Atlanta.Congressman Henry Gonzalez exposed the BNL scandal in 1991 after he noticed thatthis little branch of the Italian government bank had loaned Iraq $5 billion.This came after November 1989 when the White House guaranteed bank loans to Iraqif they were used for the purchase of US farm products. If Saddam defaulted, theUS taxpayers picked up the tab for the loan and since he was always defaulting,that was obviously going to be the outcome from the start. Instead of buyingfood, Saddam spent the money on arms, including purchases from the MatrixChurchill machine tool company in England (which was the subject of a court casein which the British government was implicated, and this led to the ScottInquiry). Although many US investigators warned Bush that the money was beingused for arms, the loans were allowed to continue.The scam was so obvious, when you look at the other evidence. Son George wasdoing the same as Father Prescott did with Hitler. Funding an aggressor so youcan start a war with him. Some of the money was spent on buying poison gas froma CIA front called Cardeon Industries in Chile.27 When the war started, Saddamdefaulted on the loans and the US taxpayers are now paying for the money spentby Iraq to fight their own sons and daughters. The cover-up of this, as usual,led to the scapegoating of the small fry. The whole thing was blamed on the bankmanager at the BNL’s Atlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogoul, who could neverhave sanctioned that sort of money without the highest authorisation. USDistrict Judge, Marvin Schoob, said the claim that the Atlanta branch could loan$5 billion without the approval of the head office in Rome could only come outof “never, never land.” The judge said that Drogoul and four other employees atthe branch:> “…were pawns or bit players in a far larger and wider-ranging sophisticated> conspiracy that involved BNL-Rome and possibly large American and foreign> corporations and the governments of the United States, England, Italy and> Iraq…Smoke is coming out of every window. I have to conclude that the building> is on fire.” 28This is the last thing the Bush administration and the Global Elite wanted tohear. Judge Schoob was removed from the case and replaced by Judge ErnestTidwell, who refused to allow any evidence to be presented about the CIA or BushWhite House involvement in the bank. Drogoul was persuaded by his attorney,against his better judgement, to plead guilty. The funding of the Iraqi armsbuild up before the Gulf War and its prosecution by the UN was a calculated planto trigger the conflict, and it involved the Bush administration, the Britishgovernment of John Major, the Italian government, the Soviet Union, and theother leading governments controlled by the Global Elite. It also involved afamiliar name: Henry Kissinger.As early as 1984, Kissinger Associates were arranging loans from the BNL to Iraqto finance its arms purchases from a little known subsidiary of Fiat, theItalian car makers (headed by leading Bilderberger, Giovanni Agnelli). CharlesBarletta, a former Justice Department investigator, was quoted about this in theSpotlight newspaper of November 9th 1992. The report said:> “Barletta added that federal probers had collected dozens of such> incriminating case histories about the Kissinger firm [director, Lord> Carrington]. But Henry Kissinger seems to possess a special kind of immunity.> I’m not sure how he does it, but Kissinger wields as much power over the> Washington national security bureaucracy now as in the days when he was the> Nixon administration’s foreign policy czar. He gets the payoff; others get the> blame. Kissinger will remain unscathed until Congress finds the courage to> convene a full-dress investigation into this teflon power broker.”Hear, hear.The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)The Bush (Republican) and Clinton (Democrat) wings of the One Party State haveanother mutual connection, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, whichhad close links with the Italian BNL. The BCCI was formed in the early 1970s andexpanded rapidly to boast 400 branches in 78 countries. Its name is remarkablysimilar to the Banque De Credit International (BCI) of the Mossad agent, RabbiTibor Rosenbaum, which was used to fund Permindex and launder syndicate CIA andMossad drug money at the time of the Kennedy assassination. Its “successor”, theBCCI, was a major player in the drug money laundering network and was used forthis purpose by the Elite elements within the CIA, British Intelligence,Israel’s (or the Rothschild’s) Mossad, and others, who control the world marketin illegal drugs. Money to fund covert operations, terrorist groups like AbuNidal, coups throughout the world, and the financing of Iran-Contra and SaddamHussein, was also channelled through the BCCI. Money could be transferredbetween apparent enemies through this network, as with Saudi Arabian money whichfound its way to Mossad. In this case, Saudi and other Gulf money was launderedthrough the BCCI and transferred to CenTrust in Miami, which was later seized byfederal investigators. The BCCI owned 28% of CenTrust. Allegations emerged thatRobert Gates, the man Bush had nominated as his Director of the CIA, hadobstructed an investigation into drug money laundering by the BCCI. Gateswithdrew his nomination to be CIA Director, as he had once before, whenimplicated in Iran-Contra. The BCCI crashed amid a worldwide scandal in 1991. Itwas the world’s biggest banking collapse and cost investors billions of dollars.Three years before the crash, Robert Gates was describing the BCCI as the Bankof Crooks and Criminals.29The BCCI began to operate in Pakistan in 1972 with most of its funding providedby the Bank of America and the CIA. Bank of America also loaned money to peopleto buy stock in BCCI, probably to hide the scale of its control, and the B of Aknew all about money laundering. In 1986, it was fined $7 million for 17,000acts of washing dirty money. Some researchers say that the Bank of America isowned by the Rothschilds. At the hub of Rothschild involvement in the BCCI wasDr Alfred Hartmann who, at the same time, was the managing director of the Swissbranch of the BCCI; the head of the Zurich Rothschild Bank A.G.; a board memberof N.M. Rothschild in London; and a director of…Italy’s BNL.30 The involvementof the Rothschilds at the heart of the BCCI was never mentioned or investigatedby the lap dog media, nor the alleged involvement of the Rothschild ‘gofer’, andcurrency speculator, George Soros (Bil).31 George Bush and Bill Clinton both hadconsiderable connections with the BCCI, among them one Jackson Stephens, ownerof Stephens Incorporated, a big investment bank based in Little Rock, Arkansas,the home of Bill Clinton. Stephens was one of the founders of the BCCI. He hadconnections with a company called Harken Energy and arranged a loan for themfrom a Swiss Bank affiliated with the BCCI. This would have greatly pleasedGeorge Bush Junior, the president’s son, who sat on the Harken board. Anotherson, Jeb Bush, also had numerous dealings with the BCCI. He was often seen inthe bank’s Miami office32 and George Bush’s deputy campaign manager, James Lake,worked for a major owner of the BCCI at the same time. When Bush’s ‘opponent’,Bill Clinton, ran for president, his main financial backer was Jackson Stephenswho made the donations via his Worthen National Bank which was connected to theBCCI. Stephens was implicated in deals in which the BCCI secretly and illegallytook over the First American Bank of Washington and others. This was the man whofunded the president.George Bush’s involvement with the BCCI was considerable, according to theChicago journalist, Sherman Skolnick, who made a detailed study of the bank. Hehas claimed publicly, including an interview on Radio Free America, that Bush,Saddam Hussein and others, used the BCCI to split $250 billion in oil “kickbacks”, the skimming off of money paid by western oil companies in the Gulf. Heclaims the records implicating Bush in deals with Saddam and Manuel Noriega werein the hands of the Bank of England and that the money was channelled throughthe BCCI and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), branches in the USA. HenryGonzalez, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, identified links betweenthe BCCI and BNL. Skolnick told interviewer, Tom Valentine, on Radio FreeAmerica:> “The bulk of the money went through BCCI. That bank was formed in the 1970s> with seed money from the Bank of America, the largest shareholders of which> are the Rothschilds of Chicago, Paris, London, and Switzerland…The bank is> also linked to the financial affairs of former President Jimmy Carter, and his> friend and one-time budget director, banker Bert Lance.> “Some of the…Democrats who have been involved in this whole affair have been> published, for example, in the May 3 issue of The Wall Street Journal. During> the 1988 presidential campaign, additionally, BCCI was one of the major> financiers of the Michael Dukakis campaign. …BCCI financed the Democratic> Party in the United States and arranged deals for Republicans outside the> United States.” 33Jimmy Carter personally dedicated a number of BCCI branches and they made an$8.5 million donation to one of his favourite charities. Carter’s foreign travelafter he left the White House was paid for by the BCCI and his banker friend,Bert Lance, was bailed out of big financial difficulties by a man called GhaithPharaon, a front man for the BCCI.34 This would fit with a contact’s suggestionthat the man behind the BCCI was an Arab, Gaph Feherton, a major funder of JimmyCarter’s presidential campaign. Andrew Young, Carter’s former United Nationsambassador and a fellow Trilateralist, had a loan of $160,000 written off by theBCCI and he was paid to promote the bank to individuals and governments inAfrica and Central America.35 The Republican senator for Utah, Orrin Hatch, wasmaking stirring speeches in support of BCCI even while it was being indicted fordrug money laundering. The Democrat Clark Clifford and his law partner RobertAltman, the BCCI’s lawyers, were at the centre of the story, also. PriceWaterhouse, the BCCI’s auditors for nearly 20 years, were giving the bank alargely clean bill of health while all the corruption was going on. Skolnicksaid records detailing the alleged Bush-Saddam deals were held in the Chicagobranch of the BCCI, which was seized by the Reagan-Bush Administration in 1988(along with other BCCI assets in the United States). Skolnick went on:> “The same bank has records showing joint business ventures between General> Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, and George Bush. In January of> 1990, the federal prosecutor in Tampa had former top officials of Florida’s> branch on trial. They were allowed to escape prison with only a slap on the> wrist and a small penalty. Here’s why: they told the Justice Department that> if they were going to prison, they had documents from their bank showing that> George Bush had private business ventures through their bank with a series of> dictators including not only Saddam and Noriega, but others as well…> “…Saddam’s oil was shipped to Texaco. In 1985 a Texas jury, at the behest of> Pennzoil, issued the largest damages verdict in American history against> Texaco. Pennzoil claimed that Texaco damaged them in a deal with Getty Oil.> Who owns Pennzoil? George Bush and his friends [the Liedtke brothers referred> to earlier, in relation to Watergate]. …As a result Texaco fell under the> domination and supervision of Pennzoil. Where did the kickbacks to Saddam> reportedly come from? They came from the deals between Texaco and its> subsidiaries purchasing oil from Iraq.” 36If you placed end to end all the questions that George Bush needs to answer, butwon’t, they would stretch from Washington to Baghdad. Via Panama City. Anofficial investigation was ordered to expose the BCCI scandal. It was chaired byDemocrat senator, John Kerry, of Massachusets. It exposed nothing. Senator Kerrywas chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which received largecontributions from the BCCI. Senator Kerry is also a member of the Skull andBones Society, as is George Bush. The corruption across American politics,media, and business, is staggering and so it is in the United Kingdom wing ofthe Global Elite operation, where the BCCI had its main base.The report on the bank by Lord Justice Bingham decided that the collapse was dueto “a tragedy of errors, misunderstandings, and failures of communication.” Forgoodness sake, it was one of the biggest drug money and illegal arms moneylaundering operations the world has yet seen. It implicated some of the biggestnames in global politics, banking, and business, and financed terrorists, drugcartels, and covert operations by the CIA, Mossad, and others. The Bank ofEngland completed the cover-up through an arrangement with the bank’s principalowners at the time of the collapse, Abu Dhabi. This agreement allowed importantrecords and witnesses to leave Britain. How convenient. In his review of DirtyMoney, a book about the BCCI, the journalist Robert Sherrill said:> “Dirty Money clearly leaves the impression that many officials are less than> enthusiastic about digging deeper into the scandal. Could it be because of> that rumoured list of 100 politicians that the BCCI paid off? Or because ‘key> investigators’ have indicated that if they continued their probe it might take> them ‘into the highest levels of political power around the world’ in ways> that would dwarf even the wildest conspiracy theory? Whoa! That would never> do.” 37On that note we will take our leave of George Bush and welcome Mr Bill Clinton.He defeated Bush, with support from the Washington Post among many others, andon January 20th 1993 he officially became the 42nd president of the UnitedStates. George Bush (CFR, TC, Skull and Bones Society, 33rd degree Freemason,and Republican), was replaced in the White House by Bill Clinton (CFR, TC,Bilderberger, Rhodes Scholar, 33rd degree Freemason, and Democrat). The nameschanged, the controllers did not. The One Party State rolled on.Bill ClintonWilliam Jefferson Clinton was born in Hope, Arkansas, and brought up in HotSprings. His Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University gave him a grounding in theWorld government philosophy and he knew what was required for politicaladvancement from an early age. Clinton said in an interview in 1994 that he knewfrom Carroll Quigley’s books that a permanent shadow government of bankers andgovernment officials existed which controlled the political agenda from behindthe scenes. He said that, while still a young man, he realised that it wasnecessary for him to gain access to this inner circle if he was to become partof the decision-making process that shapes the world.38 That is exactly what hedid. His desire for high office was no doubt fired when he shook hands with JohnKennedy as a boy. He was another product of the Global Elite production line ofpresidents: easily manipulated, knows how to do as he’s told, and with amountain of unpleasant information about him waiting to be revealed if he stepsout of line. “We’ll give them a Democrat president this time, just to let themthink they still have a choice”, you can almost hear the manipulators say. DavidRockefeller, the Kingmaker of America, had met with Clinton in the mid-1980s atWinrock, the farm built by Winthrop Rockefeller, a former governor ofArkansas.39 The state of Arkansas is an Elite centre. The southern wing of theScottish Rite of US Freemasonry is based there and it was from this organisationthat the Ku Klux Klan emerged. The Klan’s emblem is the Maltese Cross, the sameas the Knights Templar, the Knights of Malta and the Knights of the GoldenCircle, which played a major role in the Rothschild manipulation of the AmericanCivil War. The Ku Klux Klan is the old Knights of the Golden Circle underanother name, controlled by the same force. It is said to be funded today byMossad.40 According to the German magazine Neue Solidaritat, the guru andfoster-father of Bill Clinton was Parson Wo Vaught, a 32nd degree initiate inthe Scottish Rite.41If you think the background to George Bush is amazing, well old Bill has a fewsurprises in store, also. Indeed, these ‘opponents’ have so much in common. Heprogressed politically and became governor of Arkansas, the position he heldwhen he was summoned by David Rockefeller to the Bilderberg Group meeting inBaden Baden, Germany, in 1991. The invitation came after the controllers haddecided that he would be the next president of the United States.Bill Clinton, according to the American Freedom Network, is a member of manysecret societies, including an Illuminised Freemasonry order which claimsallegence to the martyred Knights Templar leader, Jacques de Molay. In Arkansas,Clinton sat at the head of a complex network of drug running, money laundering,and general corruption. His biggest financial backer when he ran for presidentwas, as we’ve discussed, Jackson Stephens, one of the founders of the BCCI. TheCitizens for Honest Government organisation produced an investigative video intoBill Clinton’s background in 1994 and they interviewed a former friend ofClinton in the Arkansas days, Larry Nichols. It would appear that Clintonmisjudged Nichols. He thought he could be trusted to keep quiet and take theperks. Clinton gave him the job of Marketing Director of the ArkansasDevelopment Finance Authority (ADFA). It was a State-run operation created byClinton to, he said publicly, invest tax money in low interest bond loans tolocal businesses, colleges, schools, and churches. It would stimulate jobs, hesaid. When Larry Nichols took up his post, he saw the truth. Nichols said:> “…I’d been there about a month and I realised that I was at the epicentre of> what I’d always heard about all my life…I was literally working, sitting, in> the middle of Bill Clinton’s political machine. It was where he made his pay> offs, where he repaid favours to people for campaign support. I was in an> interesting seat and I knew it. If you needed a million dollars, you had to> get your application handled by the Rose Law Firm and pay them $50,000. There> were five other companies in the state of Arkansas that were actually more> qualified in bond structuring and applications, but the Rose Law Firm got ’em> all.” [This, by chance, was the law firm run by Hillary Clinton (CFR)]> “I started checking around, and I kept asking…the comptroller, Bill Wilson.> …how did people make payments on these loans? He looked at me and said: ‘They> don’t.’ He thought I knew. Well, that blew my mind. And this is about two> months in. It was getting tough then. So I started gathering documents. After> everybody left I would stick around as if I was working on the annual report.> That would give me access to the documents and I made copies of them all.”Nichols established that Bill Clinton’s Arkansas Development Finance Authoritywas laundering drug money! ADFA was a front for giving loans to his businessfriends, who would then fund his election expenses, while at the same time itwas also used to launder drug profits. Nichols went on:> “There was a hundred million a month in cocaine coming in and out of Mena [an> airstrip] in Arkansas. They had a problem…you create a problem in a little> state like Arkansas. How do you clean one hundred million dollars a month?> ADFA until 1989 never banked in Arkansas. What they would do is…ship the money> down to…a bank in Florida which would later be connected to BCCI. They would> ship money to a bank in Georgia, which was…later connected to the BCCI. They’d> ship to Citicorp in New York, which would send the money overseas.” 42At the centre of this operation was Clinton’s closest friend, Dan Lasater, whowould be jailed with the president’s brother, Roger Clinton, for cocaineoffences. Doc Delaughter, the police investigator in charge of the Lasater case,said he gathered detailed statements from people connected with Clinton’s friendand his use of drugs to get young girls hooked and under his control for sexualfavours. The policeman revealed how he suffered harassment from his own policedepartment during his investigation and, he said, he knew that was because ofthe connection between the state police and Governor Clinton’s office. Lasaterspent less than a year in a minimum security prison for his drug offences andwhen he was released, Bill Clinton granted him a full pardon. Legislationenacted by Governor Clinton helped Tyson Foods to become the biggest company inthe state. The owner, Don Tyson, was given $10 million by ADFA and never paid acent of it back. He did, however, put $700,000 into Clinton’s election campaign.Doc Delaughter said he had enough evidence on Tyson to launch an investigationinto a possible drug distribution racket. The interconnected corruption wasastonishing. Larry Nichols said:> “The first loan made at ADFA was to Park-O-Meter…As I started looking, I found> that the secretary-treasurer was Webb Hubbell…Guess who drafted the> legislation… which created ADFA? Webb Hubbell. Guess who introduced the> legislation to our legislators and got it passed through our house? Webb> Hubbell. Imagine this. Guess who did the audit and the evaluation on the> (Park-O-Meter) application. Rose Law Firm, you guessed it. Who signed it? Webb> Hubbell, Hillary Clinton.” 43Nichols said that when reporters made inquiries about the Park-O-Meter loans,they found that instead of making parking meters, Park-O-Meter was actuallybuilding retrofit nose cone compartments that were being shipped to Mena. Thenose cones were being used to smuggle drugs back into the country and onto thestreets of America! Nichols went on:> “Webb Hubbell, the Rose Law Firm, are guilty, I say to you, of conspiring to> defraud the state of Arkansas, the Federal Government, and conspiring to> solicit the sales and the laundering of money for illegal drugs. This is your> president. This is his circle of power. These are the people when he got> elected president…he took them straight to Washington with him.”Webster “Webb” Hubbell was named acting US attorney general by Bill Clinton whenhe was elected to the White House! Hubbell was soon back in Arkansas, however,to plead guilty to charges of defrauding clients at Hillary Clinton’s Rose LawFirm of an estimated half a million dollars. This was the man who wasresponsible for the Ethics in Government Act, which required Arkansaslegislators to report conflicts of interest. Astonishingly, this actspecifically exempted governor Bill Clinton, his appointees, and relatives. Goon, pinch yourself. You’re not dreaming this. Before Hubbell left Washington hewas responsible for finding a permanent attorney general for Bill Clinton. Thiswas Janet Reno, who became head of the hilariously named US ‘Justice’ Department(which decides who, when, where, and whether, to prosecute). Webb Hubbell is notthe only government-appointed crook that Janet Reno has come into contact within her career. She had been District Attorney for Dade County, includingdowntown Miami, which was exposed as perhaps the most corrupt judicial system inthe country. Reno’s lack of action in the face of the evidence, led to an FBIundercover investigation which, in 1990, resulted in nearly half the judges inMiami being indicted on extortion charges. The decisions and judgements duringJanet Reno’s term at the Justice Department have served perfectly the aims ofthe New World Order, including the genocide at Waco (of which more later) andthe suppression of information about drug running operations (including thoseout of Mexico, involving the leaders of the Mexican government). Researchersbelieve that Reno is a front for Webster Hubbell to be the real attorneygeneral.One of America’s biggest drug trafficking operations, perhaps the biggest, wasset up at the Mena airstrip in Arkansas in 1982 by Barry Seal, a pilot for theDrug Enforcement Administration! 44 He moved his trade to Arkansas because ofthe hassle he was having from the authorities in his home state, Louisiana. Hehad no such hassle in Arkansas. Russell Welch, the policeman in charge of theSeal investigation, revealed: “He said 1983 was his most profitable cocainesmuggling period ever. He said that the airplanes that he had placed at the MenaAirport, there were four of them, a couple of Cessnas, a couple of Panthers, andone or two stragglers here and there, different airplanes. He said they werepurchased solely for the purpose of cocaine smuggling.” Welch added that theplanes had special, and illegal, cargo doors which could be opened in flight todrop the drugs and money at other sites in Arkansas.But where were the prosecutions? In the ten years during which the Mena drugoperation was common knowledge, there was not one major prosecution. Yet whenClinton became president, he announced… guess what? Yes, a war on drugs. Thiswas shortly before he revoked random drug testing for White House staff anddropped 121 posts at the Office of National Drug Control. Barry Seal is alsopart of the link between Bill Clinton, Oliver North, the Reagan-Bushadministration, and Iran-Contra. According to court records, eye witnessreports, and press accounts, Oliver North held a series of meetings at LittleRock in the early 1980s to set up the illegal Contra weapons pipeline. One ofthe main operatives was Barry Seal and another was Terry Reed, a former combatpilot in Laos, who moved to Little Rock in 1983 and set up a training base forContra terrorism at Nella Ark, eleven miles north of Mena. Reed said at his owntrial in 1989 for fraud charges that at least one of the early meetings to planthe Nella Ark centre was attended by Bill Clinton’s brother, Roger, and he saidother meetings were attended by Clinton’s close associate and drug runner, DanLasater. Yet again we see the One Party State in action. While the RepublicanReagan-Bush presidency was involved in Iran-Contra, the ‘opposition’ in the formof Democrat governor, Bill Clinton, was covertly supporting it in Arkansas.The power of the Elite to control the major newspapers and broadcast media wasseen again in January 1995, when a 4,000 word article exposing the Barry Sealdrug-running operation at Mena and its connections to Iran-Contra and the CIAwas withdrawn from the Washington Post. It was immediately dubbed “The GreatestStory Never Told”. The article was due to appear in the “Sunday Outlook”section, after eleven weeks of debate and argument among the staff. Lawyers hadbeen through every line and approved it legally, the type had been set, and theillustrations completed. The contracts with the authors had been signed andLeonard Downie, the executive editor, had given his consent. Then suddenly, itwas pulled and the Post’s managing editor, Robert Kaiser (CFR), said it was a“non-existent story” and a “reprise of rumours and allegations”. Sure it was.The owner of the Washington Post is the Bilderberger, Trilateralist, and memberof the Council on Foreign Relations, Katherine Graham. The authors of thearticle were Doctor Roger Morris, formerly of the National Security Councilunder Johnson and Nixon, and Sally Denton, the former head of the SpecialInvestigations Unit at the newsagency, UPI. Both have long records of this typeof investigation. Their exposé was compiled from detailed research whichincluded access to Barry Seal’s bank and telephone records, invoices,appointment books, handwritten notes, personal diaries, and recordedconversations, plus police records and surveillance reports. The article saidthat Seal was flying planes out of Mena to export weapons to Bolivia, Argentina,Brazil, and the Contras in Nicaragua, and they returned full of cocaine for salein New York, Chicago, Detroit, St Louis, and other cities. Morris and Denton saythat Seal had such close ties with the CIA that he believed he could smugglewhat he wanted, whenever he wanted, and they point out that nine separateattempts by state and federal authorities to stop him were blocked. All thistook place, incidentally, during the Reagan-Bush “War on Drugs”. The articlewithdrawn by the Washington Post had said: “Over the entire episode looms theunmistakable dark shape of US government complicity in vast drug trafficking andgun running”. And it asked the questions that the mainstream media have failedto ask:> “For three presidents of both parties – Messrs Reagan, Bush, and Clinton – the> old enduring questions of political scandal are once again apt: What did they> know about Mena? When did they know it? Why didn’t they do anything to stop> it?” 45The involvement in drug trafficking of Bill Clinton, George Bush, and the CIAwas also revealed by businessman Terry Reed and his co-author, John Cummings, intheir 1994 book, Compromised: Clinton, Bush, And The CIA.46 Reed was a former USAirforce Intelligence Officer who became a successful businessman. He wasrecruited by the CIA to set up a CIA front company in Mexico selling hightechnology and consultancy. When Reed realised it was being used to ship drugs,he tried to get out of the operation and to return to Arkansas, then governed byClinton. As usual, Clinton and the CIA sought to silence and discredit Reed byaccusing him of what they were doing. He was charged by Clinton and the Arkansasauthorities with drug running! Reed also reveals in his book how Time magazineand other publications and newspapers were involved in disinformation andcover-ups to keep the truth about drugs from the public.Barry Seal was not convicted for his drug crimes. Instead he was murdered. Thishappened as he was beginning to speak openly about what he knew. He told how hewas ordered by the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Administration to photographSandinista officials in Nicaragua loading drugs onto a plane for shipment to theUnited States. This photograph was used by President Reagan in a televisedspeech in March 1986 as propaganda against the Nicaraguan regime. This led toCongress voting another $100 million in aid to the Contra terrorists inNicaragua who were running drugs in league with the CIA. This drug runningoperation was done with the knowledge of the then Vice President Bush. Seallater admitted to reporters that the Sandinistas in his photograph were notloading drugs at all. He also spoke of the Contra drug smuggling network and itsconnection with the Colombian cartels. Soon after this, in February 1987, Sealwas dead.This period was littered with murders and suspicious deaths in Arkansas. OnAugust 23rd 1987, two boys, Kevin Ives and his friend Don Henry, were outwalking in the early hours in the area of the Mena airstrip. Later they werefound dead on a railway line. The State Medical Examiner, Fahmy Malak, a manappointed by Bill Clinton, ruled that the deaths were an accident. The parentsdisagreed and asked for a second opinion, a request that was met with resistancefrom the authorities on all fronts. They won a court order requesting samplesfor the second opinion of everything the crime laboratory had, but Malak stillrefused to hand them over. Eventually other opinion showed that Don Henry hadbeen stabbed in the back and Kevin Ive’s skull had been crushed before they wereplaced on the railway line. Malak still said it was an accident. The boys hadboth fallen asleep on the tracks, he said. It’s just the place you would chooseto go to sleep, isn’t it?Six people who talked to the police about the boys’ murders were themselveskilled. Keith McKaskie knew what was planned for him. He said goodbye to hisfamily and friends in 1988 and days later he was murdered. The following year,Jeff Rhodes, a young guy from Benton, Arkansas, rang his father to say he had toget out of town because he knew too much about the deaths of the boys andMcKaskie. Two weeks later Rhodes was found shot dead. Keith Coney was fleeingfor his life on his motorcycle when he collided with a truck; Gregory Collinswas shot; Richard Winters and Jordan Ketelson were both killed by shotgunblasts. The head of the Saline County Drug Task Force who had uncovered evidenceof the Arkansas Police Department’s involvement with drug smuggling and thecover-up of the boys’ murder, was forced into hiding. This was all going onwhile President Clinton was governor for Arkansas.Investigating Bill Clinton or making allegations against him would appear, fromendless evidence, to be a very dangerous occupation. Danny Casolaro, a reporterinvestigating Clinton and an alleged bonds racket, was found dead in a WestVirginia hotel. Paul Wilcher, a Washington lawyer, was investigating Clinton andwas due to meet Danny Casolaro’s former attorney. Wilcher was found dead sittingon the toilet in his apartment. Prosecuting attorney, Charles Black, askedGovernor Clinton for funds to continue the Mena drugs investigation. The moneynever came, but Black’s mother was brutally murdered. Police said there was noconnection. Ed Willey, the manager of Clinton’s campaign finance committee, waskilled with gunshot wounds. Verdict: “Suicide”. John Wilson, a city councillorin Washington who was reported to be planning to expose Clinton’s dirty tricks,was found hanged in 1993. Verdict: “Suicide”. Kathy Ferguson, the wife of Danny,an Arkansas police patrolman and Clinton bodyguard, talked about a number ofsexual incidents involving Clinton, and she said her husband had taken PaulaJones to Clinton’s hotel room where he, allegedly, dropped his trousers andpropositioned her. Kathy Ferguson was found dead with a gun in her hand.Verdict: “Suicide”. Husband Danny then denied Clinton’s connection with PaulaJones. Danny is still alive. Paula Jones says Kathy was telling the truth. JonParnell Walker, a senior investigator for the Resolution Trust Corporation, waspressing for an investigation into the collapsed Madison Guaranty Savings andLoan company, linked to Clinton under the heading the “Whitewater Affair”. Hefell from the balcony of a new apartment in Arlington, Virginia. Verdict:“Suicide”. C. Victor Raider II was co-chairman of Clinton’s presidentialcampaign, but they fell out. Raider and his son, Montgomery, died when theirsmall plane crashed. Herschel Friday was a member of Raider’s committee and anexpert pilot. He died when his plane exploded. Dentist Ronald Rogers was on hisway to talk to a journalist about Clinton when his plane crashed in clearweather. Luther “Jerry” Parks from Little Rock had compiled a study of Clinton’ssexual activities. Clinton owed him $81,000 for providing guards during thepresidential campaign and his wife said he had threatened to reveal theinformation he had unless he was paid. Parks was shot dead on September 26th1993. Park’s son, Gary Parks, said his father had names, dates, places –everything about Clinton’s liaisons. He said he also had details of Clinton’sdrug taking and that of his brother, Roger. Shortly before his father’s murder,the phone lines at his home were cut, the security system turned off, and thefiles on Clinton were stolen. In Arkansas, no autopsy need be performed onanyone ruled to have committed suicide, even if the evidence points to murder.This law was introduced by Bill Clinton in one of his last acts as governor.The death most publicised in connection with Bill Clinton is that of hislifelong friend, Vincent Foster, a lawyer at Hillary Clinton’s company, the RoseLaw Firm. His death by ‘suicide’ came during investigations into the financialscandal known as the Whitewater Affair. The Clintons said their investment inthe Madison Savings and Loans company was a loss-maker. Others say it was a scamto skim off federal money. What is beyond question is that it cost the taxpayers$60 million. Robert Fiske was named as special prosecutor to lead the‘investigation’ into Whitewater and that same week, the Rose Law Firm began toshred documents. One of the shredders, Jeremy Hedges, said: “They had his[Fosters] initials pretty much all over…everything from the box to the manilafiles to – I even saw his signature on one of the Rose Firm letterheads.” 47 Ademonstration was held outside the Rose offices when people heard what was goingon. Again in that same week, there was a fire at the Worthen Bank Building ownedby Jackson Stephens, one of the founders of BCCI, and Clinton’s main financialbacker. Stephen’s bank advanced the Clinton presidential campaign $2.8 million.Less than two years earlier, the bank had earned a profit on a transactioninvolving student loans controlled by Bill Clinton. The size of the profit? $2.8million.48 Clinton channelled ADFA funds through the Worthen Bank after 1988.The fire there destroyed documents related to the Whitewater investigation.On July 20th 1993, Vincent Foster, a senior partner with Hillary Clinton andWebb Hubbell in the Rose Law Firm before his appointment as White House deputycounsel, and the man handling the Clinton’s personal legal affairs, was foundshot dead at Fort Marcy Park, off the George Washington Parkway on the west bankof the Potomac River across from the capital. The verdict was our old friend:suicide. The gun was still in his hand, which is hardly what would have happenedas he reacted to the consequences of the shot. The suicide verdict was madebefore there had been either an autopsy or a ballistics test. Larry Nichols hasa police memo proving that Foster was found in his car, not the park.In March 1994, when the speculation would not go away, the White House issued aphotograph of Foster’s body at the scene which was said to prove that it wassuicide. The gun was in his right hand. Foster was left-handed. The photo showsthe body surrounded by brown leaves. But he had died in the summer and reportersat the scene soon after he died said there were no leaves on the ground. TheWhite House also announced (five months after Foster’s death) that four membersof Bill Clinton’s staff had ransacked Foster’s office the night he died! Theyincluded Patsy Thomasson, Hillary Clinton’s personal assistant. It was done,they said, for reasons of “national security”. God help us. Patsy Thomasson wasa leading assistant to Clinton’s pal Dan Lasater, when he was, as shown incourt, dealing drugs.49 Thomasson was also named in law enforcement files fordrug trafficking and it was she who stopped drug testing for White Houseemployees.This is the President of the United States we are talking about here. This isthe White House, the supposed centre of power in the most powerful country inthe world. And people go on allowing it to happen. Clinton was actuallyre-elected in 1996!There is another intriguing aspect to the Foster story. Documents shown to theLondon Sunday Telegraph reveal that Foster was jetting around the world andmaking strange visits to Switzerland while still working in private practice atthe Rose Law firm.50 Records show that he was flying with Delta Airlines (atdiscount rates only available to senior government officials or those involvedin work for the federal government), before he was publicly connected in any wayto the government. Twice he made trips to Switzerland with American Airlines andSwiss Air, staying for little more than 24 hours before returning home.Switzerland is a major coordinating centre for the Global Elite. These visitstook place on November 3rd 1991 and December 7th 1992. The latter was in thetransition period between the Bush and Clinton administrations. On July 1st1993, Foster used his American Express card to purchase another ticket toGeneva, but then cancelled. Later that month he was dead. His wife, Lisa, knewnothing of these trips to Switzerland, apparently. Many researchers link Fosterto the Arkansas computer firm, Systematics, owned by…Jackson Stephens. They alsolink him to Mossad.The suspicious deaths and the intimidation go on. In the midst of all of this,Larry Nichols was approached by attorney Gary Johnson, who wanted to help himexpose the money laundering and general corruption at Clinton’s ADFA scam.Coincidentally, Johnson lived next door to Gennifer Flowers, one of the womenClinton denied having a sexual relationship with. What anyone does in theirprivate life is up to them, but it is what followed here that Americans mightconsider worth addressing. Gary Johnson had a security camera at his front doorand this captured Clinton entering Gennifer Flower’s apartment. He went in withhis own key. Johnson had this recorded on tape and could prove that Clinton waslying. Attorney Gary Johnson was attacked at his home and suffered the mostterrible injuries. The people who did this stole his tape of Bill Clinton. Thisis America in the 1990s. How could all these things be covered up, glossed over,and the Clintons not face a public investigation into all these matters I havehighlighted? Larry Nichols has the answer:> “A lot of people wonder how Bill Clinton could control a state the size of> Arkansas with the absolute authority that he did. It’s not hard. You see,> after twelve years, after kissing the people that have the money, Bill Clinton> controlled the legal system, he controlled the judges, he controlled the> attorneys, he controlled the banks.” 51Which is precisely what the Elite do on a global scale. And when Clinton wentoff to the White House, he played the same game. Democracy is no longer justphoney, it is virtually non-existent. A new kid on the block in the Americanmedia is House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the latest ‘star’ of the Republican Party,who lambasts Clinton and demands ‘change’. This is what Clinton demanded beforecontinuing business as usual. What happened to the proposed Clinton blitz on themedical system? He and Hillary were going to take on the drug companies, theysaid, and the shares in those companies went down. Then the Clintons changedtheir minds and the shares went up. What happened in between? It doesn’t matterwho is president of the United States or prime minister of the United Kingdombecause the same force will be in power until we do something about it.President Bush helped to engineer the Gulf War, pressed for the introduction ofthe GATT ‘free trade’ agreement, and the expansion of the North American FreeTrade Area (NAFTA) throughout the Americas. His successors from the ‘opposing’party, Bill Clinton and Al Gore, both supported the Gulf War, and they havesupervised the passing of the GATT through Congress and proposed the expansionof NAFTA into South America.52 Who led the Republican Party in its support forGATT and voted with the Clinton Democrats? Who also voted for NAFTA? Clinton’sgreat ‘critic’, Newt Gingrich, and another Republican leader, Bob Dole. At theTrilateral Commission meeting in Copenhagan, Denmark, in May 1995, two USmembers, former Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, and Senator William Roth, werereportedly questioned about why Gingrich and Dole had made mild criticisms ofthe World Trade Organisation before supporting it. Foley and Roth assured theTrilateral Commission members that Gingrich and Dole were merely involved in“necessary political posturing” and their support was “never in doubt”.53 Sumsup the political process, really. When ‘Republican’ Dole ran for president, hisco-chairman for finance was… Jackson Stephens…the backer of ‘Democrat’, BillClinton!It was the same Newt Gingrich, a vehement promoter of Israel, who made a speechat a gathering of military and intelligence officers in Washington in 1995calling for the subversion of Iran. The scheme he articulated was firstexpressed by an Israeli government propagandist called Martin Indyk, who wasappointed by Bill Clinton to serve as Middle East policy ‘expert’ on theNational Security Council. The same anti-Iran and anti-Iraq policy appeared inthe March/April 1994 issue of Foreign Affairs, the magazine of the Council onForeign Relations, of which Gingrich is said to be a “proud member”. BillClinton is also a member of the CFR and so is his national security advisor,Anthony Lake, who called for the “dual containment” of Iran and Iraq in theForeign Affairs magazine. How nice to have such amazing agreement between‘opponents’. On September 2nd 1994, Avonoam Bar-Yosef, writing in the prominentIsraeli daily, Ma’Ariv, said that seven of the leading members of Bill Clinton’sNational Security Council were Jewish. The article, headlined “The Jews who runClinton’s Court”, quoted the rabbi of the Adath Yisrael synagogue, as saying:“…for the first time in American history…the US has no longer a government ofGoyim [Gentiles], but an administration in which the Jews are full partners indecision making at all levels”.Newt Gingrich’s wife, Marianne, is collecting $2,500 a month as vice-presidentfor business development for the Israel Export Development Company, which aimsto attract American businesses to a high tech business park in Israel. She firstmet her boss, David Yerushalmi, while on a tour of Israel sponsored by theIsrael lobbying group, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.54 ArneChristianson, a former official of the same American-Israel Public AffairsCommittee, is now a top policy advisor to her husband, Newt Gingrich. The Bushand Clinton administrations, as with Clinton and Gingrich, share many commonthreads and on anything that involves the New World Order agenda, they all votethe same way. They are also awash with members of the Council on ForeignRelations and the Trilateral Commission, the vehicles for the Rockefellers andthe Elite to manipulate the US and the world.The British One Party StateIn the United Kingdom, as elsewhere, there is a nexus of people andorganisations which connect banking, business, and politics. We have governmentministers linked to companies and organisations which their legislation hasaffected. We have members of parliament taking bribes to ask questions in theHouse of Commons on behalf of companies. We have them paid to ‘lobby’ forinterest groups. We have former cabinet ministers walking out of government andinto top posts. Lord Wakeham was the energy secretary who supervised theprivatisation of the UK’s state-owned electricity industry. The merchant bank,N.M. Rothschild, has made a fortune from its work on government privatisations –including that of the electricity industry and the coal industry, thanks tocontracts agreed while Lord Wakeham was in charge at the energy department. WhenLord Wakeham left the government, he became a director of…N.M. Rothschild.Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was sacked by Prime MinisterJohn Major and became a director of…N.M. Rothschild. Lamont worked for theRothschilds before going into government, as did the Treasury Secretary, AnthonyNelson, and John Major’s former Welsh Secretary, John Redwood, whounsuccessfully challenged him for the leadership in July 1995.The story of the Redwood challenge is very interesting. John Redwood, formerlyof All Souls College, Oxford, was ‘seconded’ from N.M. Rothschild to head theDowning Street policy unit of Margaret Thatcher, a role Lord Victor Rothschild,the political manipulator and alleged spy, had enjoyed under the premiership ofEdward Heath (Conservative, Bil) and unofficially under Harold Wilson (Labour,Bil). Redwood’s policy unit was behind the orgy of privatisations of stateutilities which has handed control of essential public services to the bankingelite. This policy has made enormous sums of money for N.M. Rothschild. Redwoodthen returned to Rothschilds before becoming an MP via the safe Conservativeseat of Wokingham in Berkshire. If a monkey stood for the Conservatives inWokingham, it would be elected. Once in parliament, he (Redwood, not the monkey)was appointed to the Department of Trade and Industry at the time his originalprivatisation plans were being introduced.55 Now there’s a coincidence for you.Isn’t life just amazing?In early June 1995, the Bilderberg Group met at Burgenstock in Switzerland.According to Spotlight sources,56 the Bilderberg elite decided that John Majorwould be given a choice: get back into line and support a Federal Europe with acentral bank and a single currency or be removed from office. In that samemonth, Major was persuaded to resign as leader of the ruling Conservative Partyand offer himself for re-election. He said he was fed-up with the rumours of achallenge to his leadership by MPs opposing further centralisation of power inEurope. “Put up or shut up”, was the message. The man who “put up” was JohnRedwood who publicly opposed a federal Europe. His main supporter in theelection was his N.M. Rothschild buddy, Norman Lamont, another man ‘opposing’ acentralised Europe. What was the outcome of this challenge, however? Redwoodlost and Major used this as an opportunity to purge his cabinet of those arguingagainst a Federal Europe. More than that, a deal was probably done in whichMajor agreed to hand over power to Michael Heseltine who favours a federalEurope. Major and Heseltine had a three-hour meeting on the day of the vote andafter his ‘victory’, Major appointed Heseltine as “Deputy” Prime Minister at thehead of a network of power. It may be that Heseltine was given the reins ofgovernment (under the control of the Global Elite) and in return Major wasassured of enough votes to survive as a figurehead, puppet prime minister. Sowho benefited by that challenge from John Redwood and Norman Lamont, the two“anti-federalists” from N.M. Rothschild? Those who want to see a United Statesof Europe – the very thing Redwood said he stood to oppose. What another amazingcoincidence then, that a few days before the Redwood ‘challenge’, we find amongthe guests at the Bilderberg meeting in Switzerland the name…Norman Lamont. Hewent as a Rothschild representative together with Emma Rothschild, Lord VictorRothschild’s daughter. Well, I never. Norman “save our sovereignty” Lamontattending a meeting of the organisation that has been behind the manipulation tocreate a Federal Europe for more than 40 years. The same meeting which decidedthat John Major must come into line on Europe or be ousted. Norman, my old son,you have been rumbled. The Labour MP, Giles Radice, the chairman of the EuropeanMovement, would have seen Lamont at Burgenstock because Radice was also there.How strange he didn’t mention that while Stormin’ Norman was so publicly‘opposing’ a federal Europe. Radice must have forgotten. Another Britishgovernment ‘name’ at Burgenstock was Lamont’s Conservative colleague WilliamWaldegrave, the then secretary of state for agriculture and a man implicated inthe arms to Iraq scandal. Waldegrave has close connections with the Rothschildsand served under Lord Victor Rothschild in Ted Heath’s Downing Street Policyunit (1971–73). Interestingly, James Goldsmith, the billionaire financier whoformed a political party to “oppose” a European superstate, is a frontman forthe House of Rothschild and a second cousin of Baron Edmund de Rothschild. He’salso a close friend of George Bush. It is important to remember that the Eliteseek to lead the organisations both for and “against” what they desire, toensure complete control of the “debate” and its outcome.Also on the board of N.M. Rothschild are Lord Armstrong (TC, Bil), the formerhead of the civil service and cabinet secretary during Margaret Thatcher’sprivatising mania. So are Sir Clive Whitmore, former permanent secretary at theHome Office; Sir Frank Cooper, former permanent secretary at the Ministry ofDefence; and Sir John Fairclough, former chief scientific adviser. N.M.Rothschild has twenty-six non-executive directors on the board, severalconnected with government. The company was involved in the privatisations ofBritish Gas, British Coal, the electricity industry, the water industry, theForestry Commission, and the Royal Ordnance Factories. According to the DailyTelegraph of January 26th 1995, it has developed the image of “the government’sfavourite bank” in the light of its success in being selected so often by aprocess “independent” of government departments, which chose the banks to advisethe companies being privatised. Sir Michael Richardson was vice chairman of N.M.Rothschild and chairman of the Rothschild company, Smith New Court, when thisprivatisation work was being won during the Margaret Thatcher years. SirMichael, a senior Freemason, is a close associate of Margaret Thatcher.We can always rely on the media to expose these matters, however. The SundayTelegraph of January 29th 1995, ran an article justifying theRothschild/Wakeham/government connections and saw nothing wrong with them. TheSunday Telegraph, like The Daily Telegraph, is owned by the Bilderberger, ConradBlack, and on the board of Telegraph Newspapers plc is Evelyn de Rothschild, thechairman of…N.M. Rothschild! The article failed to mention that. They must haveforgotten, too. The House of Commons Register of Members’ Interests revealedthat 200 of the 243 Conservative backbenchers during the Major governmentelected in 1992 held a total of 276 paid directorships and 365 paidconsultancies. The potential for corruption is quite, quite, extraordinary. Andwhen do they find time to represent their voters? Maybe this is why virtually noMP or member of Congress actually read the detail of the GATT agreement beforevoting it into law! The same with representatives throughout Europe who didn’tread the detail of the Maastrict Agreement on centralising power in a EuropeanUnion before they voted in favour. And what of the Labour Party, that other wingof the One Party State? They supported both GATT and the Maastrict Agreement, asdid the Liberal Democrats. Here we see modified Hegelianism again. Two‘opposite’ forces, socialism and capitalism, were brought into opposition by theElite in the early years of this century in Britain and they have fused into oneforce, which now differs only in words, not deeds. There are certainly scores ofunanswered questions relating to leaders and high ranking members of the LabourParty through this century.Doctor Kitty Little is a long time researcher into the corruption andinfiltration within the British Intelligence agencies. Her scientific career hasincluded research for the Ministry of Aircraft Production during the SecondWorld War followed by nine years at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment atHarwell. In her submission to the 1995 Nolan Committee on Standards in PublicLife, she tells the story of an attempt to recruit her to the Communist Party atOxford University in 1940. Oxford University, you will recall, was a bastion ofthe Milner Circle and the Round Table, particularly All Souls, New Chapel, andBalliol. The communists, she said, had gone “underground” by joining theuniversity Labour Party and she attended a meeting of a Labour Party “studygroup” in a room at University College. The main speaker at the meeting, whoclearly believed he was among “friends”, began to reveal the plot to“destabilise the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, ready for a Marxist takeover”.She later realised that this was part of the plan to introduce the globalcentralised control called the New World Order. The plot was outlined by thespeaker at that Oxford meeting to destroy United Kingdom defences, engineer aMarxist takeover of Rhodesia and South Africa, and to use what became known asthe European Community as a smokescreen to hide the changeover to a centralised,Marxist, rule of Europe. The plan was also to destroy British manufacturingindustry. He went on to describe how members of the political section of thissubversive organisation were going to infiltrate the British parliament andcivil service, some entering each of the political parties. Many would go intothe right wing of the Labour Party, others to the left wing of theConservatives. Eventually there would be a fusion into a new “Centre” party. Hesaid that the British distrusted extremists and so posing as “moderates”occupying the centre ground would allow them to dismiss their opponents as“Right wing extremists”. This subversive organisation did not have a name, hesaid, because that would make it harder for people to prove it existed. Thespeaker said that he had been chosen to be the head of the political section ofthis organisation and he expected himself one day to become the prime ministerof the United Kingdom. All this was said in 1940 and that man did indeed becomeprime minister.His name was Harold Wilson.Wilson was the British prime minister throughout the period between 1964 and1976, except for the four years between 1970-74 when the Conservative Partyleader, Edward Heath, was in office. Harold Wilson and Ted Heath were bothBilderbergers and both close associates of Lord Victor Rothschild. Wilson tookover the Labour Party leadership with the death of Bilderberger, Hugh Gaitskell,in 1963. Significantly, Gaitskell was not in favour of a federal Europe. Hisdeath was very convenient because Wilson became leader at an opportune time.Conservative Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan (Comm 300, RIIA), was driven fromoffice by the Profumo spy scandal in the same year that Gaitskell died, openingthe way for the Bilderberger Sir Alec Douglas Hume (Lord Home) to take over thePremiership. Hume would later be a chairman of the Bilderberg Group and alsoserved on the Committee of 300. The following year Hume faced – and was defeatedby – Harold Wilson, in the 1964 election. The political upheavals in Britainmirrored those in the United States where Lyndon Johnson became president in1963 after the Kennedy assassination in which, in my view, Lord VictorRothschild was involved.Dr Little says that when she made her story public, the Daily Express journalistand writer of intelligence ‘exposés’, Chapman Pincher, showed a copy of herallegations to Harold Wilson. He was issuing libel writs like confetti at thetime, but his only reaction to Dr Little was to say she had mistaken him for aTom Wilson. She knew she had done nothing of the kind, but she checked theentire university records and there was not even one “T” Wilson enrolled therein this century! She knew Wilson as an Economics Fellow at Oxford because it washe who researched and compiled most of the Beveridge Report which created thewelfare state and the social security system after the war. Beveridge, she says,was little more than a figurehead who put his name to it. On the surface, thereport was admirable in many ways, but from the perspective of the 1990s it canperhaps be seen to have wider implications. It created dependency and controlwhile destroying opportunities for self-reliance and independence outside theElite-controlled system. Now that dependency has been created, the welfare stateis being dismantled and what is left is being handed over to ‘privatisation’ –the elite bankers in other words. This is leaving people at the mercy of somevery unpleasant people and organisations. Should the underclass react violentlyto this, the Elite have another opportunity to introduce harsher laws underproblem-reaction-solution.Dr Little said in her submission to the Nolan Inquiry, that the intentions setout by the young Harold Wilson in Oxford were transmitted to Moscow and by theend of 1941 a double agent in the Kremlin had given the details to Britain’sMI5. This was circulated to senior MI5 officers, but no action was taken. Duringthis period, Kitty Little said, the “senior subversive infiltrator” withinBritish Intelligence was Lord Victor Rothschild, the man who controlled the useof Regulation 18b during the war. He was also named in a 1994 book as theunidentified “fifth man” in the Burgess-Maclean-Philby-Blunt communist spyscandal, although his involvement in covert activities was far, far greater thanclaimed in that book.Dr Little has had access to sources at some very high levels over the last 50years. She says that Lord Rothschild was not the “fifth man” in a KGB spyscandal. Instead, he was the spider at the centre of a web of infiltration andcorruption. He controlled the activities of Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Blunt andGuy Liddell, the acting head of MI5. She names another man in this circle asTommy Harris, about whom little is known, except that he was a good cook. Harriscooked meals for the group when they met regularly at his home. Maclean was notdirectly involved with them. His work at the Foreign Office was to feed geologyreports to Guy Rothschild in France who used them to control essentialresources, especially uranium. According to Dr Little, the Rothschilds nowcontrol 80% of the world’s uranium. This spider’s web of corruption within theBritish establishment was not about spying for the Soviet Union. This is morecamouflage. The aim was to further the ambitions of the New World Order. HaroldWilson’s nameless subversive organisation had (has) three sections, thepolitical (led by him), the economic, and the ‘biological’. The head of thebiological section was the overall controller. Until his death, that was LordVictor Rothschild. Who is it today?Lord Rothschild helped to finance MI5 agent, Peter Wright, in the production,with Chapman Pincher, of the ‘exposé’ book called Their Trade Is Treachery,which names the late MI5 chief, Sir Roger Hollis, as the fifth man and ‘clears’Lord Rothschild. Later Rothschild arranged for Wright to produce another book,the infamous Spycatcher, which also named Hollis. Margaret Thatcher’s vehementopposition to the book’s publication ensured it was a best seller around theworld and added to its credibility as an ‘exposé’. Leading this opposition toSpycatcher on behalf of the government was Lord Armstrong, the cabinet secretaryto Margaret Thatcher and friend of Rothschild. It was in a court hearing overSpycatcher that Lord Armstrong (Bil, TC) made his famous distinction betweenlying and being “economical with the truth”. When he retired from governmentoffice, Lord Armstrong became a director of…N.M. Rothschild. In a letter to theSpeaker of the House of Commons on May 1st 1987, Dr Kitty Little says:> “Early in the war Wing Commander Arnold, then head of a section in MI5, had> reason to think that Rothschild was not to be trusted. He took steps to have> the most sensitive material kept from him, but found Rothschild’s backers too> powerful to do more than that. Later, when Sir Roger Hollis was> Director-General, he asked Wing Commander Arnold for a detailed report of> events from that era.> “When Wilson became leader of the Labour Party a very serious problem arose,> since it was the head of the political section of the subversive organisation> who was in line to become the next Prime Minister. Shortly before his death,> the late Sir Theobald Matthew, the then Director of Public Prosecutions, told> me that he considered that he and the Director General of MI5 had almost> sufficient legally admissible evidence to prosecute. Sir Theobald said that in> his opinion when a Minister used his official position to take action to> promote objectives of a criminal organisation…in a manner that would be> criminal if he were acting as a private citizen, then those actions are still> criminal. This is only logical, since Ministers are better placed than private> citizens to do irreparable harm to the nation. Sir Theobald died while Wright> organised a smear campaign against Sir Roger Hollis and the Deputy> Director-General, that was launched with the aid of Lord Rothschild and> Philby. And so Wilson escaped prosecution.” 57It is astonishing how many people die at the most convenient times. Dr Littlesays that Lord Rothschild was actively seeking to discredit MI5 and after 1979ordered Peter Wright and Chapman Pincher to indulge in character assassinationand disinformation. It is notable that Spycatcher claimed an MI5 plot todestabilise the Wilson Labour government in the period we are talking about.Could this not be yet another smokescreen to hide the truth that in fact MI5 wasmaking legitimate investigations? Rothschild covertly collaborated with‘socialist’ Harold Wilson (Bil) and worked openly with ‘Conservative’ EdwardHeath (Bil, TC), who occupied 10 Downing Street between them for eleven years.Heath invited Rothschild to head his government’s policy unit, the CentralPolicy Review Staff, and to select its personnel!58 One of Rothschild’s roleswas to supervise British Intelligence and to reorganise the Foreign Office. Iwonder if this included Group 13, the Foreign Office assassination squad? Yes,the British Foreign Office has its own assassination squad. From this time therun down of Britain’s aircraft, shipbuilding, car, steel and machine toolindustries began to quicken – exactly as Wilson had predicted in 1940. And theman behind the plan under Wilson and Heath was Victor Rothschild who was workingtowards a European superstate and the end of national sovereignty. During theirperiods in office, both Heath and Wilson made organisational changes to MI5.Wilson limited the techniques of investigation that were allowed, and demandedto be told if any MPs were under investigation. Heath went further and placedmany other decision makers “out of bounds” for the security services and thepolice. These two opponents had a number of things in common, including theirenthusiasm for the European Community. Edward Heath took Britain into Europe andis to this day a vehement campaigner for full integration into a centralisedEurope with a European central bank and currency. Wilson began the move tometrication in Britain, which is ending British forms of measurement andreplacing them with the European version. Dr Little says she was told that Heathand Wilson were friends when they first arrived at Oxford University in the1930s. She says of Harold Wilson’s sudden resignation little more than a yearafter winning the 1974 General Election:> “I have every reason to think that before the end of 1975 they [MI5] were> within sight of having sufficient legally admissible evidence for a> prosecution. Wilson resigned. Callaghan succeeded him as Prime Minister, and> had the members of MI5 who had been carrying out the investigation of Wilson’s> criminal activities removed, on the grounds that they were ‘Right wing> extremists’.” 59Jim Callaghan (Bil) has since kept abreast of foreign policy as a jointpresident of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. His fellow presidentsare Lord Carrington (TC, Bil, Comm 300) and Harold Wilson’s former chancellorand home secretary, Lord (Roy) Jenkins (TC, Bil), who, with Lord (David) Owen(TC, Bil), Bill Rogers (Bil), and Shirley Williams, left the Labour Party in theearly 1980s to form a centre party, the SDP, now the Liberal Democrats. Allthese people worked closely with another prominent Labour government ministerunder Harold Wilson and James Callaghan: the Bilderberger, Trilateralist,chairman of the IMF Interim Committee, Committe of 300 member, and councilmember of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Denis Healey. I wonderif, when they were in the highest political offices in the land, Wilson, Heath,Jenkins, and Healey ever got together and pondered on the remarkable twist ofdestiny that led four people who were at Oxford University in the same period,to become the leading political names of the 1960s and 1970s, just as the UnitedKingdom was committing itself to the European Community. Indeed Jenkins would goon to be president of the European Commission and Heath would take the UK intothe community. Wilson (Jesus College, University College), Healey (Balliol),Jenkins (Balliol), and Heath (Balliol) are such an inspiration to us all. Lookwhat an Oxford education can do for you. In this same period, even the LiberalParty leaders did Oxford proud in the form of Jo Grimond (Balliol, Bil), andJeremy Thorpe (Trinity College), the author of the book, Europe: The Case ForGoing In. Later leaders of the Liberal Party (now the Liberal Democrats), DavidSteel and Paddy Ashdown are also Bilderbergers and supporters of the Europeansuperstate. Once again, maybe all these connections are simply a coincidence,but you have every right to know they exist. It’s called democracy. All thosemembers of the Bilderberg Group involved in the creation of, and membership of,the European Community does challenge the idea of coincidence a little though,don’t you think? But then, as George McGhee, a US ambassador to West Germany andBilderberg attendee said: “the treaty of Rome, which brought the Common Marketinto being, was nurtured at Bilderberg meetings”.60 Precisely.One other point about the findings of Kitty Little and similar researchers isthat of Rhodesia, the country named after its creator, Cecil Rhodes. It is nowZimbabwe. The new Constitution for Rhodesia replaced dictatorship by white rulewith dictatorship by Robert Mugabe for the benefit of the Elite. It was agreedupon in the autumn of 1979 at a conference at Lancaster House in London, chairedby Lord Carrington, who had taken over as foreign secretary from David Owenafter Margaret Thatcher’s election victory a few months earlier. Theconstitution was presented to the assembled Rhodesian political leaders, blackand white, by Carrington, who insisted on an answer by the end of the week. Oneman in the Rhodesian delegation who would have seen the inherent flaws in thiswas John Giles, a constitutional expert. On Tuesday October 4th 1979, on thevery day that the Rhodesians were due to discuss the Carrington proposals, JohnGiles went missing and was later found dead. Dr Kitty Little was at LancasterHouse that day to meet Ian Smith, a friend of many years. She has been tryingever since to make the background to both the conference and the death of JohnGiles public. The previous day, Dr Little says, Giles had been to Hamley’s (thefamous London toy shop) to buy Christmas presents for his children. On themorning he disappeared he rang his wife, sounding very cheerful and upbeat, butlater that morning he was observed looking suddenly very worried aboutsomething. In the afternoon, an official car, a Granada Ghia, came to pick himup. He was never seen alive again.While Lord Carrington’s proposals, in the absence of Giles, tied the Rhodesiandelegation in mental knots and won the day, the police were advised that Gileswas missing. The next morning, John Giles was found dead on a path close to therear entrance of Lancaster House. Verdict: “Suicide”. His death would not havebeen made public at all, unless an ambulance man had alerted the press. Thecoroner, who did not call policemen at the scene to give evidence, decided thatGiles had jumped from a first floor window at Lancaster House, which those whohave been to the spot say was an impossibility, given where the body was found.And that’s another thing. The Lancaster House staff used the service door of thebuilding and would have had to step over the body to get in and out. It wassupposed to have laid there through a whole afternoon, evening, and night. Yetit wasn’t found until the following morning.The case was handled by the local police and the authorities refused to discussit with the Rhodesian-Zimbabwe Special Branch. No police file exists on JohnGiles, I understand. Kitty Little insists that Ken Flower, the head of theRhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation was, or had been, a member ofBritain’s intelligence section, MI6. She also says that it is now known that MI6was working to destabilise Rhodesia in order to force the dictatorship swap thatLancaster House was really designed to produce. According to Dr Kitty Little’simpeccable sources, Ken Flower might qualify for the Guinness Book Of Records asthe doublest of double agents! While head of Rhodesian Intelligence he was alsoworking for MI6, the KGB, East European Intelligence, the CIA, and a number ofAfrican Intelligence networks. He worked with the “D” group of MI6 operativeswho, to quote Dr Little, “did nasty things and had them blamed on Ian Smith”.Zimbabwe is obviously very important to the Elite and the multinationalcorporations, one of which, Rio Tinto Zinc, had enjoyed the experience of havingLord Carrington on its board.There is considerable evidence to support Kitty Little’s contention. Two monthsafter the Lancaster House conference, it was revealed that Margaret Thatcher(Bil) and Lord Carrington (TC, Bil, RIIA, Comm 300) had ordered a massivesurveillance operation on the delegates. Telephones were tapped, rooms bugged,diplomatic communications were monitored, and the British used Rhodesiansecurity to interpret the African language. This was revealed by reporter BarriePenrose in the London Sunday Times of February 3rd 1980, under the headline,“Minister’s Phone was Tapped by Secret Services”. This, said the article, waswhy “Lord Carrington could conduct the conference on the basis of brinkmanship.The intelligence services told him what the brinks were”. Which leads to anotherquestion: if the rooms and phones were bugged, why did they not know what hadhappened to John Giles until he was found dead the next morning? Ummm. KittyLittle contends that Margaret Thatcher was kept in the dark by Carrington abouta host of foreign policy subjects and only selected information was allowed toreach her. This clearly would have coloured her views of which policy to follow.It is emerging that for all her apparent power, the “Iron Lady” was anotherpuppet, perhaps even more than most.In the light of what Kitty Little says, it is interesting that (as I mentionedearlier) I was approached by the wife of a former official of the South Africangovernment, who said she had seen documents explaining how the TrilateralCommission had ordered Britain out of Rhodesia. Both foreign secretariesinvolved, Lord Carrington (Conservative) and David Owen (Labour) are connectedto the Trilateral Commission. Carrington was a member and Owen would become onesoon after Carrington replaced him as foreign secretary.Since the sudden death of John Smith (TC, Bil), the ‘new’ Labour Party has cometo power under Prime Minister Tony Blair, an Elite chosen one, who was supportedby the establishment and Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Gordon Brown, hisBilderberg Chancellor of the Exchequer, immediately conceded the government’sright to set interest rates to the Bank of England. The leadership of the threemain political parties in the UK are agreed on almost all that matters to theNew World Order agenda, as they were in the days of Wilson, Heath and JoGrimond/Jeremy Thorpe. When you look behind the words and camouflage, there ishardly a jot of difference between them on the way ahead – integration into theEuropean Union and a single currency and bank. They only differ, in publicanyway, on the timescale. On the fundamentals of economic policy it is hard toprise them apart.So what has been the effect of all this on a key ambition of the manipulators –the creation of a Federal Europe with centralised control? While we’ve beenhaving this farce of a debate over whether the UK should agree to a singlecurrency and a European Central Bank, the truth is that we are already committedto it. The politicians involved know it too. They are just kidding you, laughingat you probably. The UK Conservative Party claims (for public consumption only)to oppose the centralisation of power in Europe while Conservative members inthe European Parliament are also members of the alliance grouping known as theEuropean People’s Party, which openly calls for a United States of Europe. Thisis actually written in its constitution!61 One way the confidence trick has beenhidden is by increasing dramatically the numbers of laws being introduced at alllevels of government, particularly in Europe. By the mid-1980s, the publishedlaws emanating from Brussels together with parliamentary legislation,Ministerial Rules, and Orders in Council, exceeded in just six months, the sumtotal of all laws introduced in Britain before 1900.62 This tidal wave oflegislation is not an accident. It is there to ensure that millions of pages arevoted into law without the lobby fodder politicians, or even the governmentministers, having time to read them, let alone assess what they really mean amidthe calculated gobbledygook and ambiguity. Another smokescreen is the beliefthat those who run the European Union are stupid and incompetent. Not at thehighest levels they’re not. Butter mountains and wine lakes may seem to be theresult of incompetence, but who benefited from these policies? The multinationalcorporations who were able to absorb all the smaller farmers and producers putout of business by the surpluses. That was the idea. It all has to be donecovertly because if the public knew what a federal Europe really means theywould not agree to it. In 1947, a group of Conservatives and Liberals produced adocument called Design For Europe and one paragraph revealed their approach veryclearly:> “Moreover – and it is as well to state this bluntly at the outset – no> government dependent upon a democratic vote could possibly agree in advance to> the sacrifice which any adequate plan must involve. The people must be led> slowly and unconsciously into the abandonment of their traditional economic> defences…” 63Edward Heath was agreeing to the political union of Britain in Europe as earlyas April 1962 when he was Lord Privy Seal. He told the Ministerial Council ofthe Western European Union that, “…you have decided that those who join theEconomic Communities as full members must also join the Political Union. I amsure that this was the right decision.” (Command Paper 1720.) Meanwhile thepeople were being told that the Common Market was only a free trade zone. BeforeMr Heath (Bil) took Britain into Europe, he attended a meeting in Paris inOctober 1972 to negotiate the conditions with the French President, GeorgesPompidou (Bil), a former employee of Guy Rothschild. John Davies, Heath’sSecretary of State for Industry, was at the meeting and told the ConservativeParty’s Monday Club that the following had been agreed: UK technology would bemerged with European industry. Britain had led research and development for morethan 50 years and so it was ‘only fair’ that someone else should have a turn –France. As Britain ran down her manufacturing industry, London would become themoney market of Europe. Heath further agreed to run down sterling and abolishthe monarchy.64 (The barrage of bad publicity that has destabilised the Royalfamily in recent years is designed to destroy the monarchy. Who has been tappingtheir ’phone calls? The manipulators. Prince Charles and Princess Diana arebeing played off against each other by ‘advisors’. The target year for the endof the monarchy is 1999.) Edward Heath (Bil) and Sir Alec Douglas Hume (Bil)signed on behalf of the UK, a Treaty of Accession to the Treaty of Rome and wewere in the European spiders web.Also accepted by Mr Heath at the time of Britain’s entry and by Harold Wilsonand James Callaghan during the ‘renegotiation’ of British membership, was thatBritain would renounce her national sovereignty and become part of a federalEurope. Local government was reorganised to reshape the country in preparationfor this, and devolution of power to the regions of the UK is being promoted toprepare for the plan for a Europe of ‘regions’. These regions would be givenlimited powers akin to the county councils of today and they would beadministered by those who control the European superstate. The Maastricht Treatyon European Union even uses the word “municipal” elections when it talks ofnational elections within Europe.65 Very appropriate, given the game plan. In1980, the European Commission published their map of regions. Those which havebeen proposed in the former Yugoslavia as a result of the war are virtually thesame as those on that map. When the absence of ‘England’ on the map wasquestioned, Dr Little and her colleagues were told that the national governmentwould no longer be an “administrative unit”. But while all this agreement wasgoing on behind the scenes around the time of British entry, Mr Heath wasdenying in public that there would be any loss of sovereignty. The lack ofinterest in the people’s wishes reached a new low when a document published bythe European Assembly in February 1984 said that anyone who even voted in theJune 1984 European elections, would be deemed to have supported the idea ofEuropean Union! Equally outrageous was that the Maastricht Treaty on EuropeanUnion had not even been published at the time of the UK general election whichPrime Minister John Major claimed had approved the document! Isn’t democracyjust fantastic? We’re having elections now in which only the clairvoyant canmake an informed choice. When Douglas Hurd, the then foreign secretary, signedthe Maastricht Treaty in February 1992, he committed Britain to a United Statesof Europe. He and the government will tell you differently. They will say thereis a get-out clause which says:> “Unless the United Kingdom notifies the Council that it intends to move to the> third stage [political and monetary union], it shall be under no obligation to> do so.”What they don’t tell you is this Protocol was over-ruled by another on pageP/UP-UEM/en61, which has these paragraphs:> “The high contracting parties…declare the irreversible character of the> Community’s movement to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union by> signing [my emphasis] the new Treaty provisions on Economic and Monetary> Union.> “Therefore all Member states shall, whether they fulfil the necessary> conditions for the adoption of a single currency or not, respect the will for> the community to enter swiftly into the third stage, and therefore no Member> state shall prevent the entry into the third stage.”Mr Hurd signed those provisions and therefore committed the UK to those terms.In other words, having lost the power of veto, the UK either accepts politicaland monetary union or pulls out of the show altogether. The public ‘debate’ is afraud. Mr Hurd, Mr Major, and the pro-Europe Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke (Bil)knows that. So does Tony Blair (Bil), an Elite “chosen one” and Paddy Ashdown(Bil). Mr Hurd was one of those who stood in the Conservative leadershipelection after Margaret Thatcher was removed, on the orders of the BilderbergGroup, for her opposition to political and monetary union. Mr Hurd, whorecommended Henry Kissinger for his knighthood, was well schooled in Europeanaffairs. He was private secretary to Ted Heath (1968–70) when Heath was leaderof the opposition, and was then appointed his political secretary (1970–74)after Heath became Prime Minister. Hurd was also a minister of state at theForeign Office under Lord Carrington in the run up to the Falklands War. One ofthe people who helped to whip up the atmosphere which led to the demise of MrsThatcher, was Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe (Comm 300), a former president of theEuropean Council of Ministers. So what awaits us now, unless we get off ourbacksides very quickly? A Europe of regions controlled by the unelected EuropeanCommissioners and the six members of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank who will have control of the single currency and the reserves of eachmember ‘State’. These six people, who will control the whole of the EuropeanUnion, shall “be appointed from among persons of recognised standing andprofessional experience in monetary or banking matters”. (Maastricht Treaty,Article 109a, page UP-UEM/eu41.) In their eight years of guaranteed security oftenure, these super six bankers of the Global Elite “may not seek or takeinstructions from Community Institutions…or any other body”. The Europeandictatorship will be complete.That is what the One Party Staters have been working towards behind their masksof opposition. Their ambitions are almost fulfilled. Only you – we – can stopthem.The Global One Party StateMeanwhile the wars, which achieve so much for the Elite, continue. When thetruth about the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and the Bosnian conflict comes out,as one day it will, the trails will lead to some very famous people and somefront line companies – especially those involved in armaments – in the UnitedKingdom, the United States, and other countries. Who armed Saddam Hussein?Britain and America did. Who armed the Iranians? Britain and American did. Whoarmed the Serbs in Bosnia? Britain and America did. The time will come when theproof will be overwhelming that this is the case and some leading armamentcompanies and politicians are going to face some serious questions. If you knowmore, please tell me.In an article in The Spotlight on December 19th 1994, writer Warren Hough,claims that Henry Kissinger was accused by French President, François Mitterand,of being the “master manipulator” of the Yugoslav conflict. The allegation issaid to have been made at a meeting of the European Security Conference inBudapest, Hungary. Warren Hough’s article continued:> “As part of their war plans, the Serb leaders spent millions of dollars on> contracts and payoffs in the US Wall Street sources say that most of these> short-lived deals were apparently set up to make money for Kissinger’s> consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, [founding director Lord Carrington, a> ‘peace’ negotiator in the former Yugoslavia] and for two of Kissinger’s> cronies, Lawrence Eagleburger and Brent Scowcroft. This populist newspaper,> after reviewing confidential bank records in New York City, warned as early as> 1992 that Eagleburger (a former secretary of state) and Scowcroft (White House> national security director in the Bush administration) concealed a> compromising ‘cash nexus’ to the Serbs while they were formulating supposedly> impartial US positions toward the warring ethnic factions of the former> Yugoslavia.”Interestingly, an ‘advisor’ to the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, has been SirAlfred Sherman who has operated from an apartment in Pale near Sarajevo, nextdoor to Karadzic’s office, according to published research. Sherman is known asthe “inventor of Margaret Thatcher” and he was at the forefront of themanoeuvring that led to her election as leader of the British ConservativeParty. She later awarded him a knighthood and together they founded the “thinktank”, the Centre for Policy Studies66 from where the economic madness of the1980s partly originated. The Serbs were funded by the Elite via Belgrade banksinvolved in massive drug money laundering. It is also amazing how many‘foundations’ were set up in the former Yugoslavia by the financial speculatorand Rothschild frontman, George Soros (Bil). He has them in Bosnia, Croatia,Slovenia and Belgrade. Soros is a close friend of Lawrence Eagleburger atKissinger Associates, the former US ambassador to Belgrade and close ally ofSlobodon Milosevic! Now what’s that I can smell? Air freshener anyone? Accordingto writer and researcher Ben C. Vidgen, writing in Nexus magazine in February1996, America, Germany and Israel were running a secret airlift of arms toCroatia and Bosnia from the start of the conflict.French journalists revealed in 1994 that CIA agents were luring Bosnian Muslimsinto reckless and hopeless counter-attacks against the Serbs on false promisesof US support. The White House call these reports “malicious lies”. But thenGeorge Kenney, an American official in charge of Yugoslav affairs at the USState Department until he quit in disgust on August 11th 1992, said that Muslimswere indeed tricked into rejecting a number of partial truce offers on theassumption that American aid would ensure them victory. Warren Hough says thatwhile the Muslims were set up, the Kissinger network was playing the “good guy,bad guy” game, which the manipulators use so often. It involved the two Serbleaders, Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic. Hough wrote:> “Under this scenario, Milosevic – the client of Kissinger Associates –> publicly repudiated and condemned the illegal onslaught of Karadzic’s troops> against Bosnian Muslims. But covertly the Milosevic government furnished the> ‘renegade’ forces of Karadzic with all the armaments and other support they> needed to wage an implacable ‘war of extermination’ against their Muslim> neighbours. Muslim resupplies were, of course, blocked by the UN arms> embargo.”The research claims also that Saudi Arabia, itself a fascist tyranny, was beingset up by this plan. According to Spotlight, King Fahd was repeatedly reassuredby his ambassador in Washington that the US planned to lift the arms embargo intime to allow decisive reinforcements to reach the embattled Muslims. As aresult the King convinced other Islamic leaders to have faith in Washington. Nowthe Saudi monarchy is denounced as a gullible fellow-traveller of the CIA, or asa traitor to Islam. Which, of course, suits the manipulators wonderfully well.In the light of all this, there are some interesting connections between the‘peace’ negotiators in Bosnia. Lord Carrington (RIIA, Bil, TC, Comm 300), LordOwen (Bil, TC) and Sweden’s Carl Bildt (Bil) followed each other as officialpeace negotiators for the European Union in the former Yugoslavia. The UnitedNations peace negotiator, who worked closely with his great friend, Lord Owen,was Jimmy Carter’s Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance (CFR, TC, Bil, Comm 300), anda director of the Rothschild bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust. When Vanceresigned, the UN appointed another negotiator to work with Lord Owen – ThorvaldStoltenberg, of Norway. Yes, you guessed it again, a member of the TrilateralCommission and the Bilderberg Group. And when they each failed to achieve peace,who was it who suddenly flew to Bosnia, amid worldwide publicity, as an‘independent’ peace negotiator? Why, it was Jimmy Carter (CFR), the TrilateralCommission’s first President of the United States. Later came Richard Holbrooke(TC, CFR, Bil), the peace envoy of Bill Clinton (CFR, TC, Bil) and the USambassador to Yugoslavia was Warren Zimmerman (also TC, CFR), who reported, likeHolbrooke, to Clinton’s Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, of the CFR andTrilateral Commission. And who was it who arrived in Rwanda on an undisclosed“diplomatic mission” days before the outbreak of that horrific conflict? LordCarrington and Henry Kissinger!Maybe this is all smoke without fire. Maybe the Trilateral Commission and theBilderberg Group just happen to run peace negotiation courses. Maybe pigs canfly. Make up your own mind. My feeling about the former Yugoslavia when I wrotethe first edition of this book was that the conflict was being usedoverwhelmingly to embarrass the UN Peacekeeping Forces and NATO. This wasdesigned to create a situation of “something must be done” which would lead togreater powers for the UN/NATO alliance and, in effect, create a world army. Asusual, the more atrocities and suffering that the public see, the greater thedemand that “something must be done”. What has happened since? The Bosnianconflict has led to the creation of a 60,000-strong NATO ‘peacekeeping’ forcewhich includes some 30 countries. It is a world army under central control –exactly as the Elite plan demanded. It is the biggest multinational force to beassembled since the second World War and it has been made possible by untoldhuman suffering. The main front man for this NATO world army was Bill Clinton(CFR, TC, Bil), the yes man for David Rockefeller and the Elite. One of thoseappointed to oversee the civilian operation in Bosnia after the ‘peace’agreement was Carl Bildt (Bil), and the officer in charge of the multinationalforce (world army) was named as US Admiral Leighton Smith (CFR). If you wantconfirmation that the world army in Bosnia is part of the Elite plan look nofurther than a full page advertisement in the Washington Post on December 6th1995. It was placed by an organisation calling itself the Committee for AmericanLeadership in Bosnia and it supported Bill Clinton’s plan for a world army inBosnia. The ad was signed by, among others, Zbigniew Brzezinski (CFR, Bil and afounder of the Trilateral Commission); Congressman Stephen Solarz (CFR);Rothschild frontman and currency speculator, George Soros (Bil); MichaelArmacost (CFR), the president of the Elite’s Brookings Institute; and LeslieGelb (TC), the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a columnist onthe New York Times. The policy on Bosnia is the Elite’s policy from start tofinish. We have one party states within a one party world under a one partyarmy.How many more have to suffer before the political stooges stop being duped? Howmany more tragedies do there have to be before the human race says “Enough!” andtakes control of its own destiny? If that is to happen, we need to stop lookingto politicians for the answers and start organising ourselves in our owncommunities to build local economies and organisations which can operate outsidethis manipulation. A good statement of intent, in my view, would be a massboycott of all state, national, and European elections. To vote under thepresent circumstances is to give credence to a system that is an insult tofreedom and democratic choice, a system that is designed to control us and notto set us free. By refusing to vote and have any part of it, we can show how wefeel. We can say to the manipulators: We know what you are doing and the game isup. We will no longer be manipulated into supporting and maintaining the oneparty state and a one party world.> SOURCES> > > 1 Treason At Westminster.

You can only do it by divide and rule – and by programming the massconsciousness (public opinion) into believing that what you want to do is a goodidea or the only option.This is crucial to both understanding how the manipulation works and to thinkingon a more streetwise vibration which will make it far more difficult for us tobe misled. For example, say that you want to introduce cameras in the streets,an armed and more authoritarian police force, and the erosion of personalfreedoms. You don’t want the public to oppose these policies, indeed you wantthem to demand that you introduce them. What do you need for this to happen?More high profile, violent crime, which creates enormous fear in the community.Achieve that and people will be knocking on your door demanding that you putcameras in their streets and give more guns and power to the police.Problem-reaction-solution. And what better way to induce more crime than tocreate a society of ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ dependent on welfare payments andthen start dismantling the welfare state? You give people a choice of goingwithout basic needs or of taking someone else’s money and property. And whenthey do the latter, the victims of the crime and the mass of people who see thereports of the crime demand that “something must be done”.All aspects of society are being used to promote this mental coup d’état. The‘education’ system is not there to inform children and young people, it is thereto indoctrinate them; the same with the media and advertising. The tax exemptfoundations coordinate the Elite’s ‘education’ policy in the United Statesschools and universities, and in the United Kingdom this is done, in part, by asecret clique known as the All Souls Group. This meets three times a year at(most appropriately) Rhodes House at Oxford University. Such education policiesare designed to turn out clones of the system and world government supporters,although the overwhelming majority of people in the teaching profession will notrealise this.I included in The Robots’ Rebellion an extract from a document found, apparentlyby accident, in 1986 called Silent Weapons For A Quiet War. Another version isreported to have been in the hands of US Naval Intelligence in 1969. It is awonderful explanation of the technique of mass brainwashing. The version I havewas found inside an IBM photocopier bought at a second hand sale in America andit describes a policy of mass mind control. This lengthy and detailed documentwas dated 1979, but it outlines a policy that has been implemented since the1950s. The document says that: “The quiet war was… declared by the internationalelite at a meeting held in 1954”. The Bilderberg Group first met in 1954. It islikely that the methods laid out in the document will be inspired by theTavistock Institute of Human Relations in London and its interconnectingoffshoots. Here is a flavour of the content:> “Experience has proven that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon> and gaining control of the public is to keep them undisciplined and ignorant> of basic systems principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused,> disorganised, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other> hand.> This is achieved by:> > > 1. disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing> > > a low-quality programme of public education in mathematics, systems design> > > and economics, and discouraging technical creativity.> > > 2. engaging their emotions, increasing their self indulgence and their> > > indulgence in emotional and physical activities by:> > > > a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and> > > > emotional rape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars> > > > in the media – especially the TV and the newspapers.> > > > b) giving them what they desire – in excess – “junk food for thought” –> > > > and depriving them of what they really need.> > > > c) rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant> > > > creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to> > > > highly fabricated outside priorities.> These preclude their interest in, and discovery of, the silent weapons of> social automation technology.

All the main aspects of the coupd’état are there and we can see this strategy at work every day. When agovernment is planning to introduce legislation against a target group as partof the plan to enforce conformity and remove freedoms, the process of softeningup public opinion against that target group begins months, sometimes years,before there is even a hint of new laws. The idea is to turn public opinionagainst the target group through propaganda and engineered events. When thelegislation is finally presented, the potential opposition is already eithergreatly reduced or destroyed altogether. Take the example of the CriminalJustice Bill introduced by the British government in 1994. It was a dreadfulpiece of work and a tremendous strike against basic freedoms, but it sailedthrough Parliament with virtually all-party support. One of its many targetswere the ‘travellers’, the groups of people who live in mobile homes of manykinds and move between various places throughout the year. They have been dubbed‘New Age’ travellers by the media. The travellers are not perfect – who is? –but it will be enlightening to look at how they were treated. In the year toeighteen months before the Criminal Justice Bill was announced, you could hardlyopen a newspaper or watch the TV news without seeing a story which suggestedthat travellers were a ‘problem’ in need of a ‘solution’. Police were stoppingand harassing the traveller convoys as they moved from site to site; councilswere refusing to allow them to cross their borders; conflicts were breaking outbetween travellers and police as the anger and frustration mounted. All wascaptured and broadcast on the main television news bulletins. Agents provocateurconnected to British Intelligence were in there stirring things up just as thecameras were on the spot, in the way such agencies operate all over the world.Once negative events and propaganda have been projected at public opinion, outgo the opinion-polling organisations with their clipboards. The people who askthe questions on the street don’t know what they are involved in. They are justasking the questions they are told and paid to ask. But opinion polls are notthere to measure public opinion so the people can be given what they desire.They are there to direct public opinion, often using loaded questions to attractthe desired reply. Tell people that 80% of the population believe something andthose of the sheep – baa, baa – mentality will quickly conform and believe thesame. Eighty per cent of people cannot be wrong, can they? Oh yes they can, ifthey have given their minds away. The other role of opinion polls is to check ifthe propaganda against a target group is working. Once the opinion polls saythat a sufficient majority now believe the target group is a problem and“something must be done”, the legislation (the solution) is taken out of thefile and put before Parliament. This approach has another advantage in that thepotential political opposition, what little there is, fears the electoralconsequences of opposing laws to ‘solve’ a ‘problem’ about which the public hasnow been programmed to believe that “something must be done”. Therefore highlycontroversial legislation like the Criminal Justice Bill (which removes basicfreedoms) goes through Parliament and into law virtually on the nod. Once thisBill was making its way into law, suddenly all the “travellers are a problem”stories disappeared and at the time of this writing, have never reappeared. Theywill only return when even more harsh legislation against them is being planned.Until then, public opinion will go on being softened up to accept legislationagainst other target groups on the Elite’s hit list and the public will go onreacting like robots in exactly the way required. Unless we choose to takecontrol of our own minds.Organisations like the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations (and theirbrothers and sisters in the United States such as the Stanford ResearchInstitute, and the Rand Corporation) research into how people will react,individually and collectively, to events, changes, and ‘buzz words’. It wasTavistock, according to research that I’ve read,1 which devised the policy of‘future shocks’, the means by which the collective human mind is bombarded withso many changes, events, and contradicting information that it overloads,switches off, and becomes subservient. This is happening all over the worldtoday, most obviously in the United States and Japan, where the population isbeing given one event after the other to fill them with fear and insecurity. Theaim is to destabilise Japanese society and break its resistance to fundamentalchange.Many of the so called ‘spontaneous’ trends that are taken on by the young areintroduced by these and other organisations and then hyped into a frenzy byadvertising and the controlled media. People talk about the “latest craze” andvery few stop to ask, “Where did this start and who was behind it?” We hearabout the “craze that’s sweeping America” and that’s all. The ‘Flower Power’period of the 1960s was hijacked and directed by this same mind manipulatingforce. The CIA and British Intelligence were experimenting with the effects ofthe drug LSD in the 1950s, before it was unleashed on the market and destroyedany possibility of substantial positive change emerging from that time. In 1953,the CIA commandeered the entire supply of LSD from the Swiss manufacturers,Sandoz (which was owned by S.G. Warburg of London). Later they did the same withEli Lilly when it began to produce LSD in the United States. People were sodoped and duped that they thought LSD was a weapon of ‘freedom’. Some still do.I’m not sure the CIA and British Intelligence had that in mind, somehow.The Diversion TechniqueAll that I am talking about here comes under the heading of ‘diversion’. This isone of the most effective of the mind manipulation weapons used against thehuman psyche. It takes many forms. If you are being held captive, one way toescape is to start a diversion. It may be an argument or a fight among fellowprisoners. Once the trouble starts, everyone’s attention, including that of theguards, focuses on the incident. This gives you the opportunity to slip awayunseen. The bullfighter’s technique is another obvious form of diversion as hefocuses the attention of the bull on his cape, so allowing himself to avoidinjury.In the world of propaganda and public mind manipulation, we are constantly beingsubjected to this. Accusations of anti-Semitism against New World Orderinvestigators is a classic example of diversion. You concentrate attention onthe issue of the messenger’s alleged racism and divert attention from what he orshe is saying about their research. We have the strategy of infiltrating‘moderate’ wings of political parties while covertly following an extreme gameplan. This is a diversion which stops extremists being identified while they,themselves, denounce their legitimate opposition as extremists. We hear fromtime to time of ‘revelations’ about intelligence agencies, but how many are realrevelations and how many are systematically leaked to divert people from what isreally going on? An example: publish a book by a ‘spy’ who names certain peopleas foreign agents. Hype it up through your controlled media and get thegovernment to vehemently oppose it, so adding to its credibility. Persuadepeople to accept that the names revealed by the ‘whistle-blower’ are correct andthose who were really involved are in the clear. If you want to introducecontroversial legislation or a government is being forced to reveal unpleasantinformation about itself, then under the rules of diversion, this should be doneon a day you know another major story is going to break. This lessens the spaceand prominence given to what you say because of the massive media coverage ofthe other big story.On the day the British Home Secretary, Michael Howard, announced theintroduction of identity cards, the Loyalist Paramilitary groups in NorthernIreland announced a ceasefire in line with the one agreed by the Republican IRA.This reduced by a tremendous amount, the coverage and reaction in the media toMichael Howard’s identity cards. I do not believe this was a coincidence,especially since the paramilitaries and the British government are in regularcontact through the secret society network and other channels, no matter whatthey may say publicly. Indeed, the secret communication between the IRA andtheir ‘enemy’, the British government, has been publicly exposed.The attempts to blame two Libyans for the bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 which killed270 people at Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988 is another case ofdiversion. None of the evidence points to Libya. That is a convenient scapegoatto move attention from what really happened and to undermine the Gaddafi regime.The evidence of independent studies and documentaries clearly points to otherMiddle East connections, the CIA, and other intelligence agencies. The Lockerbiecrash site was swarming with American agents, as locals and journalists havepointed out. Police surgeon, David Fieldhouse, said he issued death certificatesafter examining 59 bodies, but later he found that police records containeddetails of only 58 bodies.2 What happened to the missing body, no-one seems toknow. Could it just have been the body that would have shed some light on whathappened and who did it? And if the authorities didn’t know what was going tooccur, why were ‘VIPs’ warned not to take that flight after their seats had beenbooked? Among them were Pik Botha, the South African minister, and othersaccompanying him, including the head of BOSS, the South African intelligenceagency (which has close ties with the CIA and Mossad). They cancelled theirreservations on Flight 103 shortly before departure after a tip-off fromintelligence sources.3 Pik Botha told the British businessman, Tiny Rowlands,that these sources were the kind that “couldn’t be dismissed”.4Libya has been used as a diversion for years. Colonel Gaddafi was portrayed asthe monster of monsters, until it became more useful to give that title toGeorge Bush’s old friend, Saddam Hussein. The bombing of Tripoli by US planesflying from British bases in 1986 was part of this. Dozens of Libyan civilians,including children, were murdered by the Americans (with British support) inretaliation for “Libyan terrorism” at a disco in West Berlin, for which, again,there was no evidence, as later conceded by German investigators. I know nothingabout Gaddafi for sure, but I have heard suggestions that he’s hated by the US.There is another view that this “hatred” is a front for CIA terrorist trainingbased in Libya, which, it is said, has honed the skills of the IRA, the RedBrigades, and other terrorist groups. It’s hard to tell, but here I am lookingonly at the strange connections surrounding the Lockerbie bomb. The man whowrote the paper for Ronald Reagan which proposed a campaign to destroy theGaddafi regime with lies and disinformation was (by his own admission) the CIAoperative, Vincent Cannistraro. He worked for three years on the campaign withOliver North and this led to the bombing of Tripoli. Who was the man appointedto head the CIA ‘investigation’ into Lockerbie which decided that two Libyanswere responsible? It couldn’t be? Yes it could: Vincent Cannistraro. Part of theCIA campaign against Libya included the murder by the CIA of the Britishpolicewoman, Yvonne Fletcher, in St James Square, London, on April 17th 1984.This murder was blamed on the staff at the Libyan People’s Bureau. Someresearchers believe she was shot by a CIA marksman from 8 St James Square, closeto the Bureau, say some researchers. This building had been occupied from only afew months before by a company with known CIA connections.Despite this information and the fact that no evidence points to an involvementby Libya in the Lockerbie bombing, the United Nations (Global Elite) continue toimpose sanctions on that country! And the British prime minister has refused toallow a trial of the two Libyans to take place in a neutral country. Either theBritish government at the highest levels is breathtakingly dumb or they knowmore about Lockerbie than they are prepared to reveal to the people who electedthem. The United States and the Elite use the create-a-monster technique all thetime to divert attention from the fact that they are installing and pulling thestrings of far more extreme regimes throughout the world. There was no talk ofmonsters and terrorism in 1988 when the USS Vincennes fired a missile ‘byaccident’ to shoot down an Iranian passenger jet with 290 on board.5 TheVincennes was in the Persian Gulf to support Saddam Hussein, then America’sfriend and ally in the Iraqi war with Iran. The commander of the ship was‘severely punished’: he was awarded the Legion of Merit Award by George Bush for“exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service”and for the “calm and professional atmosphere” under his command during theperiod the jet was destroyed.6The stepping-stones strategy is another diversion. The Elite know the goal theyare aiming for and the stepping-stones required to manipulate public opiniontowards that end. But if they are going to persuade people to accept thosestepping stones, each one must be presented in isolation. If once they are seenby the general public as links in a chain leading towards a global centralisedtyranny, obviously the game is up. If you want barcoded human beings linked to acentral computer, you must first get them to accept credit and identity cards.You can be even more subtle by announcing first of all that the identity cardswill not be compulsory, as Michael Howard did at the Conservative PartyConference in 1994. Shouts of dismay from the audience who want them to becompulsory make you look positively moderate in comparison, and initialopposition from the civil liberties groups is diluted because the governmentsays, “But they are not compulsory; people have the choice”. Of course, the planis to make them compulsory and then go on to barcoding, but the stepping-stonesdiversionary approach demands that this be done in distinct stages, so thatpeople in general don’t realise what is going on. These tactics are used at alllevels of society. If you want to develop an area of unspoilt, isolated land,and you announce plans to build a housing estate or industrial complex, it wouldattract enormous opposition. Instead, the first stage is to propose a road toallow people greater ‘access’ to the area. Once this has been achieved a fewbuildings begin to appear, then more and more, until you have built, in stages,what you intended all along. This is one reason why the information in this bookand others like it is so important. Once you know the ultimate aims, thestepping-stones towards them become so easy to see.The ‘Free’ PressNone of this mind manipulation could happen without the media. Again, only a fewpeople in the media know they are playing a key role in programming the humanmind to walk the road to a global tyranny. The overwhelming majority ofjournalists have no idea how they are being used. I would go further. From myexperience inside the media for many years and more recently on the other sideof the microphone and notebook, I believe the two least knowledgeable andstreetwise professions – in general – are journalism and politics. As Isuggested earlier, they are two aspects of the same illusion. The politiciansact as if they rule the world and the media report events as if politicians arethe global decision makers. Thus, the real controllers can stay in the shadows,unreported and unidentified. There are exceptions when you meet a very brightjournalist who can see behind the façades. They know they are imprisoned withina media structure which severely limits what they can say and do. But they takeevery opportunity to get across as much information as they can. I have met afew of those people and they are a joy to talk to. If only that were true of therest. Most journalists on local and regional papers and local radio are eithertime-servers, who are programmed to turn out the same old establishment linewithout question while thinking their years in the profession make themstreetwise, or they are youngsters fresh out of university who have noexperience of the world and the manipulation that goes on. There are, I stress,exceptions, but I am speaking generally here. I don’t say this out ofcondemnation, but as this mindset stands between the events in the world and theway the information about them is communicated to the public, it is importantthat we know the nature of the filters and the filtering that goes on.I remember talking in Southern England one night in the terms I have outlined inthis book. There was one person in the audience who seemed to have a permanentquestion mark above her head. This turned out to be the local journalist. When Isaw her report, it was headlined “Icke’s old theory about the New World Order”.I was intrigued. “Old theory?” Had this newspaper talked about the globalconspiracy before, then? No, as it happens. The headline referred to thereporter’s contention that what I said that night about the nature of the NewWorld Order was not new because George Bush had used the same words yearsbefore! If that was an isolated example of the thought processes which provideour news, it wouldn’t be a problem. But it isn’t. I could fill another book withstories of my experiences with people bravely claiming to be journalists whohave asked questions and written articles that would make a two-year-old looklike the peak of maturity.At the national and international level, the number of journalists knowinglymanipulating the human mind is far greater than the local and regional media,but it is still a relative few. The rest just conform to the traditionalstructure and approach and allow themselves to be manipulated to manipulatetheir audience. I worked in the BBC Television national newsroom for years andeveryone around me appeared to be extremely genuine. Most of them were very nicepeople who loved their children and would not wish to leave them to face acentralised global dictatorship. But every day they turn out stories which feedtheir millions of viewers the line the Elite want them to see and hear.To manipulate the world, you don’t need to have people running around all thetime, like one of those stage performers trying to keep a dozen plates spinningon the end of a stick. Once you have created the structure, anyone coming intothat organisation, say a newspaper or television newsroom, has to conform towhat is already there. If you can get your representatives into the positionswhich appoint others into that organisation, it is even better, because you canthen fill the place with clones of your own attitudes. Also, journalists arethere to report events. If you can engineer significant events, the journalistswill report them. You don’t have to control every journalist to do this; theevent will be reported anyway. Most of the time, the background information andexplanation of that event will come from official sources. Watch a televisionnews bulletin today if you can, and see where the words the reporter is speakingare overwhelmingly coming from: official sources. So without even manipulating asingle journalist, your engineered event, be it a “terrorist bomb” or “economicproblem”, is both reported and explained in the way you want.The coverage of the horrific bombing in Oklahoma City in April 1995 was yetanother example of puppet-strings journalism. Whatever official statements wereissued, the media jumped on them immediately and accepted them as fact, withoutquestion. I listened to the BBC’s Radio Five at that time and they introduced alady from an organisation I had never heard of in America. There was not onequestion about what her organisation represented, who funded it, or what itsbackground was. The interviewer just fed her questions and allowed her,unchallenged, to give her ‘expert’ opinion on the people she believed hadcarried out the attack. In BBC Television’s review of 1995, the so called“heavyweight” news presenter, John Humphreys, parrotted the government line onOklahoma and named McVeigh and the militias as the “enemy within” even beforethere had been a trial! And they call themselves ‘journalists’. It’sunbelievable.When you are looking at the news, make a note of how short the individual itemsare. There is usually only enough time, even in major stories, to say this iswhat has happened and this is the (official) explanation. I was laughed at bymillions when I questioned that the figure I was seeing on the television newswas the real Saddam Hussein back in 1991. There was this man on the screen andthe reporter or newsreader was saying it was Saddam. We were told whom he hadmet that day, and, on one occasion, how he had swum across a river to show hispeople he was alive and well after the Gulf War. Now we know from a defectorfrom Iraq that it was not the real Saddam, but his stand-in lookalike. The mediais being conned day by day and it then cons its audience. Ask 99% of journalistsabout the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the TrilateralCommission, and the Elite in general, and they will look at you in bewilderment.They won’t even have heard of them, let alone know what their role is.But there are some journalists in strategic positions who do know and supportwhat those organisations are doing. The media is such a vehicle for the coupd’état that if it ever got into the hands of the Elite, the potential would belimitless. But we don’t have to worry because, as we are told so often, we havean independent media. Ummm. Independent of what and whom? In theAugust/September 1993 edition of the Netherland’s based magazine, Exposure,details were published of the controlling boards of the three televisionnetworks in the United States, NBC, CBS, and ABC. These networks are supposed tobe in ‘competition’ and it is this very ‘competition’ that is part of the‘independence’ which ensures we enjoy unbiased news. That’s the theory, anyway.The Exposure research came from the work of the American New World Orderinvestigator, Eustace Mullins. From what I read, Eustace and I would have verylittle in common on most things, but either the people he names were controllingthe networks at the time of the article, or they were not. The following isprovable fact: NBC is a subsidiary of RCA, a media conglomerate which appearsregularly on the career details of a number of people named throughout thisbook. Among the NBC directors named in the Mullins article were: John Brademas(CFR, TC, Bil), a director of the Rockefeller Foundation; Peter G. Peterson(CFR), former head of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co (Rothschild), and a former Secretary ofCommerce; Robert Cizik, chairman of RCA and of First City Bancorp, which wasidentified in Congressional testimony as a Rothschild bank; Thomas O. Paine,president of Northrup Co (the big defence contractor) and director of the(Elite-controlled) Institute of Strategic Studies in London; Donald Smiley, adirector of two Morgan Companies, Metropolitan Life and US Steel; ThorntonBradshaw, chairman of RCA, director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, AtlanticRichfield Oil, and the Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies (both of the latterheaded by ‘environmentalist’ and elite Bilderberger, Robert O. Anderson).Clearly the NBC board has considerable Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgan influence.Another American TV network, ABC, had on its board of directors: Ray Adam,director of J.P. Morgan, Metropolitan Life (Morgan), and Morgan Guaranty Trust;Frank Cary, chairman of IBM, and director of J.P. Morgan and the Morgan GuarantyTrust; Donald C. Cook (CFR, Bil), general partner of Lazard Freres bankinghouse; John T. Connor (CFR) of the Kuhn, Loeb (Rothschild) law firm, Gravath,Swaine and Moore, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, US Secretary ofCommerce, director of the Chase Manhattan Bank (Rockefeller/Rothschild), GeneralMotors, and chairman of the J. Henry Schroder Bank and Schroders Inc, of London(see the funding of Hitler); Thomas M. Macioce, director of ManufacturersHanover Trust (Rothschild); George Jenkins, chairman of Metropolitan Life(Morgan) and Citibank (which has many Rothschild connections); Martin J. Schwab,director of Manufacturers Hanover (Rothschild); Alan Greenspan (CFR, TC, Bil),chairman of the Federal Reserve, director of J.P. Morgan, Morgan Guaranty Trust,Hoover Institution, Time magazine, and General Foods; Ulric Haynes Jr, directorof the Ford Foundation and Marine Midland Bank (owned by the Hong Kong andShanghai Bank). Again, we see the same Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgan line-up onthe board of the ABC network which, we are told, is independent of NBC. The ABCcompany was taken over by Cities Communications, whose most prominent directoris Robert Roosa (CFR, Bil), senior partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, which hasclose ties with the Bank of England. Roosa and David Rockefeller are creditedwith selecting Paul Volcker to chair the Federal Reserve Board.Which brings us to CBS, the third of the ‘independent’ networks. Its financialexpansion was supervised for a long time by Brown Brothers Harriman and itssenior partner, Prescott Bush who was a CBS director. CBS banks through theMorgan Guaranty Trust and reports of CBS connections with the CIA and BritishIntelligence are legion among New World Order researchers. Some know it as theConspiracy Brainwashing System. The CBS board included: William S. Paley (Comm300), the chairman (for whom Prescott Bush personally organised the money to buythe company); Harold Brown (CFR), executive director of the TrilateralCommission, and former Secretary of the Air Force and Defence; Roswell Gilpatric(CFR, Bil), from the Kuhn, Loeb (Rothschild) law firm, Cravath, Swaine, andMoore, and former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Henry B.Schnacht, director of the Chase Manhattan Bank (Rockefeller/Rothschild), theCouncil on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, and Committee for EconomicDevelopment; Michel C. Bergerac, chairman of Revlon, and director ofManufacturers Hanover Bank (Rothschild); James D. Wolfensohn (CFR, TC, Bil),former head of J. Henry Schroder Bank, who has close links with the Rothschildsand the Rockefellers, (in 1995, Bill Clinton successfully nominated him to headthe World Bank); Franklin A. Thomas (CFR), head of the Ford Foundation; NewtonD. Minow (CFR), director of the Rand Corporation and, among many others, theDitchley Foundation, which is closely linked with the Tavistock Institute inLondon and the Bilderberg Group. People connected with research into how thepublic mind reacts to events and information are on the board of a United Statestelevision network? What?Again with CBS, we are looking at the same names at the helm, and all threenetworks are closely interlocked with the Council on Foreign Relations and theTrilateral Commission. How can it possibly be claimed that the three televisionnetworks in America, through which the overwhelming majority of Americans gettheir news, are independent? They are controlled or strongly influenced by thesame people! Look at the potential for recruiting only those producers,journalists, and editors who support your views and aims, and for sacking thosewho challenge your interference in what is and isn’t shown. Look at thepotential for selling a common line on events and news stories to ensure theAmerican people have no other explanations than those you want them to believe.In July 1995, ABC was merged with the Walt Disney empire and the giantWestinghouse Electric made its move to buy CBS. Two months later, TurnerBroadcasting, the company behind CNN Television, announced plans to merge withTime Warner. The deal was struck between the Time Warner chairman, Gerald M.Levin (TC) and Ted Turner (Comm 300), a leading supporter of the new globalorder. We have seen the history of Time Warner in Chapter 12[../Text/index_split_021.html#filepos965525]. The concentration of power gatherspace.The same familiar Elite control the three television networks and America’s mainnewspapers, like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los AngelesTimes. This is without even mentioning all the other media outlets andinternational news agencies (like Reuters) which the Elite control and theagencies run by the major newspapers which feed a common line to the smallerpapers via the wire machines and syndicated columnists. The mind manipulationpossibilities this offers are just incredible. Scores of leading US journalistsand editors are members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission and they are covertly working to that party line in their selection,dissection and presentation of news and information. Typical was a ‘report’ bythe famous CBS News anchorman, Walter Cronkite, into the wealth and power of theRockefellers. He closed by saying that if any family had to have as much powerand money as the Rockefellers, it was a good thing it was the Rockefellers.7Violin, anyone? I am grateful for the research into UK media ownership in theearly 1990s by Colonel Barry Turner, which he published in 1992 as a paperentitled “Control of the Communications Media and Conditioning of the PublicMind”. Much of the following information about names and newspapers is thanks tohis painstaking work. The leading ‘quality’ newspaper in the UK is the DailyTelegraph. This is owned through the Hollinger Group by the Canadian, ConradBlack. The group owns more than 200 newspapers and magazines in the UnitedKingdom, the United States, Canada, and Israel, and the group started life as afront company set up by the British intelligence as I explained earlier. ConradBlack is a member of the elite Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, aTrilateralist, and a member of the Institute for Strategic Studies. The seniorinternational advisors to the Hollinger Group are Henry Kissinger (CFR, TC, Bil,RIIA, Comm 300) and Lord Carrington (TC, RIIA, Bil, Comm 300). Some members ofthe Hollinger International Supervisory Board are Zbigniew Brzezinski (CFR, TC,Bil); Giovanni Agnelli (Bil, Black Nobility, Comm 300); David Brinkley (CFR),news commentator with ABC News; Paul Volker (CFR, TC, Bil), the chairman of theFederal Reserve Board responsible for Reaganomics and Thatcherism; LordRothschild, chairman of Rothschild Holdings; and Lord Hanson, chairman of Hansonplc. On the board of The Daily Telegraph is Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman ofthe N.M. Rothschild merchant bank. N.M. Rothschild are merchant bankers to theHollinger Group to complete the cosy relationship.A former editor-in-chief and board member at the Daily Telegraph is AndrewKnight, another member of the Bilderberg Group Steering Committee and theDitchley Foundation, and formerly of The Economist magazine (director, Evelyn deRothschild), a publication set up to press for an end to the Corn laws andpromote the principle of ‘free trade’. Knight moved on to become executivechairman of Rupert Murdoch’s News International which owns The Sun, The News OfThe World, and The Times and Sunday Times. Murdoch owns newspapers, magazines,and television networks that are estimated to have a potential audience of threebillion people. That is without his interests in the film industry. He is nowlinking in with a global telephone and communications network, MCI, and has madea bid for parts of the vast Berlusconi media empire in Italy. According to TheEuropean newspaper, he is also planning to substantially increase his mediainterests across Europe.8 In a feature in The Spotlight newspaper headed: “Whatis Murdoch Up To And Who Is Backing Him?” the writer Dan McMahan linked the riseof this media mogul to names like Harry Oppenheimer (South Africa,Anglo-American, De Beers), Armand Hammer (Occidental Petroleum), the Bronfmanfamily (who are close to the Hollinger Group and the Anti-Defamation League),and the Rothschilds.9 It is not the front men we need to look at so much as whois behind them pulling their strings. It is they who make the money availableand manipulate the politicians to allow great media takeovers and cartels toemerge. With unbelievable hypocrisy, Conrad Black’s Daily Telegraph said ofMurdoch’s domain: “This is a huge and potentially dangerous concentration ofmedia power…”10 And the Telegraph owner’s empire is not?The controlled media can feed the same basic messages to the public andhypnotise the collective mind to accept them. And if the same messages arecoming from apparently unconnected media outlets, it must be true because “theyare all saying it”. Just as we have a One Party political state, so we have aOne Media State. In the UK, you would think that the Murdoch Sun and theIndependent or Guardian were miles apart and offering different opinions. But ifyou analyse what they are all agreed on and the way they operate, none arevehicles for a radical alternative to what we have. They actually say the same.They just say it differently. The least radical newspaper in Britain is the oneclaimed to be most radical: The Guardian, the tome of the mindset I call theRobot Radicals. The founding editor of The Guardian’s ‘rival’, The Independent,was Andreas Whittam Smith. He was a member of the Trilateral Commission duringhis years at the top of that newspaper. The political ‘choice’ is an illusionand so is the media ‘choice’. Indeed the two are indivisible.When I started to have more and more success in making this suppressedinformation available to the public, the campaign to discredit me was steppedup. I was delighted in a way, because it proved I am twitching a few nerve endsamong those who wish to control the human mind. The Jewish Chronicle, whichparrots words like freedom and truth, began to write outrageousmisrepresentations of what I am saying and doing. I was having conversationswith the press officer of the Board of Deputies of British Jews – a lovely woman– who was speaking to one David Icke, while she was reading about a verydifferent David Icke in the Jewish Chronicle. Understandably she was confused. Iwasn’t because what was happening was so predictable. The sight of a paper likethe Chronicle posturing its morality while lying through its teeth is not apretty one.However, it was the Guardian, the daily house magazine of the Robot Radicalmindset, that I found most interesting. One of its reporters, a Paul Brown,arrived at a meeting in Glastonbury and built an article around one man who hadnot read my books, yet was handing out leaflets opposing them! The anti-Ickepiece came from a newspaper which claims to represent freedom. Excuse me while Ifall down, laughing hysterically. In the article were the (barely)one-dimensional clichés about ‘disciples’ and other childish nonsense, butnowhere was there a mention of the Bilderberg Group and its RIIA, CFR, TCnetwork which I had spent much of the evening talking about. But what is it theIlluminati Protocols say?> “All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions – aristocratic,> republican, revolutionary, even anarchical – for so long, of course, as the> constitution exists…Like the Indian idol, Vishnu, they will have a hundred> hands, and every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public> opinions required. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in the> direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all power of judgement and> easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who will think they are repeating the> opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any> opinion that seems desirable for us. In the vain belief that they are> following the organ of their party, they will in fact follow the flag which we> hang out for them.”> Protocol 12And most journalists, probably including Mr Brown, will not have a clue abouthow they are being used. Someone wrote to me who had read The Robots’ Rebellionand was a daily reader of The Guardian because he thought it had the integritythat others lacked. He was stunned to read Brown’s article, which he said was agross misrepresentation of what I am saying and doing. “I thought I could trustThe Guardian” he said. You can’t. You can’t trust any of them. It was the samewith a ‘journalist’ called Rosemary Carpenter on the Daily Express. She wasgiven access to the information revealed in this book and yet she dismissed itwithout any checking or research. Mind blowing. From where do the public gettheir information about political parties at election time? The controlledmedia. If the media will not support you, or are vehemently against you, it isvirtually impossible to be elected. If you are a politician looking to win orstay in power, you have to listen to what the media is demanding. If you don’t,they will turn against you and even reveal some unpleasant information whichthey have long known about, but have kept under wraps while you were playingtheir game. When Rupert Murdoch began to make positive statements about theBritish Labour leader Tony Blair (Bil) following the ‘untimely’ and sudden deathof his predecessor, John Smith, this was considered highly significant forBlair’s chances of becoming prime minister. The sad thing is that it wassignificant.The media have to keep the banks and advertisers happy. That’s where the powerreally lies. The Global Elite pyramid coordinates major advertisers intopressurising papers into following or not following, a particular line. “Printthat and we withdraw our advertising” is a powerful weapon. But, of course, wehave the media ‘watchdogs’ which are there to protect us from media abuse. Thechairman of the newspaper ‘watchdog’, the Press Complaints Commission, is LordWakeham, the former cabinet minister, who controversially went from governmentto the board of N.M. Rothschild. And while Lord Rees Mogg (Bil), the formereditor of The Times, was chairman of the television and radio ‘watchdog’, theBroadcasting Complaints Commission, he was also a Rothschilds’ director. SirZelman Cowan, another former chairman of the old complaints body, the PressCouncil, was involved in 1991 with the takeover of the Australian Fairfax Groupby Conrad Black’s Hollinger Group. Lord Armstrong, the former head of the CivilService and cabinet secretary (who went on to become a director of N.M.Rothschild) also joined the board of Carlton Television, which broadcasts toLondon and the ‘Independent’ television network in the UK. I could go on and onacross the UK media, revealing the interconnections between certain names andcompanies. Rest assured, however, there is really nothing to worry about. As thethen Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said in The Financial Times on January 19th1989: “Broadcasting will not be run by tycoons.” Phew, that’s a relief! I ratherprefer the opinion on the true state of affairs within the media of JohnSwinton, a journalist on the New York Times, who is reported to have told hisstaff at his retirement dinner:> “There is no such thing as a free press. You know it and I know it. There is> not one of you who would dare to write his honest opinions. The business of> the journalist is to destroy truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to> fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell himself, his country, and his race,> for his daily bread. We are tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes.> We are jumping jacks; they pull the strings, we dance; our talents, our> possibilities, and our lives are the property of these men. We are> intellectual prostitutes.”But here again, we come back to the same theme. The media is our creation. Itreflects the collective mind of humanity and if it did not, it could not surviveand prosper as it does. We can debate which came first, the collective mind’sattitudes or the programming of those attitudes, but if you read the averagetabloid newspaper and then spend an hour in the average bar, you will see thatthe thought patterns of the paper and the people are largely the same. Vastnumbers of people think and act like a tabloid newspaper. They have allowedthemselves to become tabloid thinkers with tabloid minds. We now have tabloidradio and tabloid television, too, which follows from the success of the tabloidnewspapers. They all want it short, incredibly superficial, and with each itemfull of either mockery, condemnation, instant judgements, the official line,and/or defence of the status quo. Oh yes, and if you can get lots of tits andbums in there at every opportunity, so much the better, because women are onlyhere to lust after. Have I just described the content of a tabloid newspaper orthe content of a conversation you will hear in almost any bar when ‘the lads’get together? Both. And that’s the point. Those thought patterns in thecollective mind created the reality we call the media. Tabloid newspapersreflect, and program, the thoughts of great tracts of humanity in anever-downward spiral. The more our thoughts are programmed, the more open webecome to even more severe programming. The media won’t change until thecollective mind changes and that will result only from changes in individualthinking. We create our own reality and the media is no different. Whateverdominates the thought patterns of the collective mind will be the physicalreality. The members of the human race in general want someone else to do theirthinking for them, and they have allowed their minds to close to the point wherethey do not want to discuss anything that isn’t superficial or full of mockeryand instant judgements of others. Hence the media we have today. We have thoughtthat into existence, too. When we change, it will change.Mass HypnosisThe media’s greatest effect on the human mind is not so much its detail, but themass hypnosis created by the same basic themes occurring over and over. Mostpeople don’t pick up detail from newspapers, let alone the broadcast media whereyou get one chance to hear something and there is no way you can go back andhear it again, let alone extract more detail from it. These themes include thecriteria for how we should judge ourselves and each other; for what is credibleor incredible, sane or insane. This background bombardment of our subconsciouswith a common ‘party line’ of information plays a major part in the way theconscious and subconscious sees itself and the world. As a result, we areallowing the sum total of the media to program our thought patterns and createour reality. I learned so much about this process when I was the focus ofunbelievable national ridicule in the early 1990s. Most of what the media saidabout me was 100% the opposite of what I was saying and writing, but the peopleoverwhelmingly believed what the media told them and I was ridiculed by millionsfor things I wasn’t saying and didn’t believe. This is happening to other peopleevery day. The mass hypnosis has also turned millions into spectators of theworld, rather than participants. We allow others to do, while we observe and sitin the stand, watching the few play the game which decides the future of thehuman race…our human race. This is symbolised by sport and the endlesstelevision soaps in which we are spectators of the manufactured lives ofoverwhelmingly cardboard, one-dimensional characters. We often live their livesinstead of our own. I love sport and there are soaps that I enjoy, too, but thedanger comes when that is all we have in our lives. As one of the IlluminatiProtocols said in the 1800s:> “In order that the masses themselves may not guess what they are about we> further distract them with amusements, games, pastimes, passions, people’s> palaces…Soon we shall begin through the press to propose competitions in art,> in sport of all kinds: these interests will finally distract their minds from> questions in which we should find ourselves compelled to oppose them. Growing> more and more unaccustomed to reflect and form any opinions of their own,> people will begin to talk in the same tone as we, because we alone shall be> offering them new directions of thought…of course through such persons as will> not be suspected of solidarity with us.”> Protocol 13We think of hypnotism only in terms of a single person lying down on a couch andlistening to the words of a hypnotist speaking softly into the ear. Or we maythink of the stage hypnotist who has a group of people doing silly things infront of a guffawing audience. Some even demand that this should be bannedbecause it is dangerous. These are obvious forms of hypnosis. But we don’trealise that we are subtly being hypnotised and encouraged to do and think sillythings every day of our lives. Instead of lying on the couch listening to thesoft words of the hypnotist, we sit in the chair listening to newsreaders, filmstars, advertising voice overs, and sundry presenters. The messages pound ourconscious and subconscious mind and we are programmed to think the way thecontrollers who own the media, the banks, the drug companies, the armamentcompanies, the oil companies, ad infinitum, want us to think. Is there anyoneleft reading this book who still believes that the idea of a global conspiracywith the tiny few controlling the vast majority is a fantasy, and impossible?Surely not.The esoteric knowledge about the nature of the human psyche is used to greateffect. While those in the spiritual movement are laughed at for theirexplanations of the human mind-spirit, this same knowledge is being used by themanipulators to covertly hypnotise us and program our subconscious. DoctorWilson Bryan Key, a professor of journalism, made a study of these techniquesand wrote three books, Media Sexploitation, The Clam Plate Orgy, and SubliminalSeduction. He discovered that millions of dollars are being spent by advertisersfor the subliminal 11 [programming of the subconscious] manipulation andindoctrination of audiences. Dr Key revealed the existence of the Tachistoscope,a film projector with a high speed shutter which flashes messages every fiveseconds for 1/3000th of a second. These messages could not be seen by the nakedeye, but were absorbed by the subconscious. The message would then filter downfrom the subconscious to the conscious level as a thought, desire, or opinion,which the person believes is their own. Years ago, a flash-frame picture of aCoca-Cola bottle used to be inserted into a cinema film just before theinterval. The audience couldn’t see it, but their subconscious could. Sales ofCoca-Cola during cinema intervals went up significantly.Through the 1950s and 60s the experimentation into this subliminal interactionwith the subconscious expanded rapidly. In 1962 and 1966, Doctor Hal C. Beckerpatented subliminal devices which increased the potential of such technology. Heoperated a successful weight reduction clinic in New Orleans using subliminalmessages directed at the subconscious and his anti-theft programme was operatedin department stores in Canada and the United States. Messages which wereinaudible to the ear were broadcast across the stores, saying “don’t steal”.Thefts from the stores were reduced. In 1986, a more advanced security systememerged which broadcast its messages under piped music. A computer ensured thatthe sound of the message went up and down with the loudness of the music. Thesesubliminal messages have been shown to work. So what else are they being usedfor?Some years ago there was a furore in France when the picture of FrançoisMitterand was seen to flash into view on the opening titles to the news. Thiswas when Mitterand was running for president. It was a mistake by the TVcompany, for sure. But what kind of mistake? An error in putting the flashpicture in the titles at all, or a mistake in leaving it in for too long, sothat the conscious and as well as the subconscious saw it? The potential forsubliminal messages to affect the outcome of elections and to direct thethinking of the mass population is simply fantastic. If they can make morepeople buy bottles of Coca-Cola with these techniques, why can’t they make morepeople vote for the party and the candidate they want? They can. Of course theycan. And given what you have read up to now, do you think they would use thatpotential to manipulate the public mind or would they refuse to do that becauseit was undemocratic? Once the technology and the knowledge is available, thereis nothing that can’t be communicated to the subconscious through this techniqueof mass hypnosis.Once more, we come back to the esoteric knowledge. The manipulators know how thepsyche works and how it is possible to program responses without the consciouslevel of awareness knowing it is happening. The technology now exists which canbe set up near a television or radio transmitter and will send out messageswhich lock into the wavelength of the television broadcast as a ‘carrier wave’,a carrier of the subliminal message. These subliminal messages are coming out ofthe television set without even the television station knowing it is happening.The messages can tell people how to vote, who they should love and who theyshould hate, what they should buy, and what they should think. Say you want tostart a riot. Send out subliminal messages to the area for a while, and thenproduce one or two agents provocateur and an event to focus anger. In no timeyou will have the people, already primed subliminally, going absolutely crazy.Then you say you need more power for the police and the military to ‘solve’ this‘problem’.The television has become the greatest tool of mind manipulation and it startswith children only a few years old. Some researchers believe children areespecially susceptible to this form of programming. Most people watch thetelevision as if mesmerised by the screen. Conversation is destroyed. Instead oftalking to people, we are talked at by the television set. Our lives areconditioned by the themes and indoctrination pouring from the screen. We aretold what is right and wrong, good and bad, success and failure, in and out. Itis our resident hypnotist in the corner of the room. Many people fall asleep infront of the television because their minds are bombarded to the point ofoverload by the incessant flow of opinions and information. What does ahypnotist do before he or she begins to make those subconscious suggestions?They put their clients into a state of relaxation, a dozy half-sleep, becausethat is when the conscious mind is quiet and the subconscious can be mosteffectively accessed. What better way, therefore, to program television viewerswith subliminal messages than to have them half asleep in the chair. In fact,people could even be put into that state by the subliminal messages coming fromthe set. And what is the real effect of the computer games and virtual realitytechnology that turns some children into zombies? Virtual reality is a good namebecause the whole system is designed to encourage the human race to accept avirtual reality and call it life. Dr Wilson Bryan Key, the investigator of thesematters, said that subliminal technology can so affect many people that they canbe programmed to start eating and drinking too much, change their sexual habits,and embark on an almost endless list of other manifestations of extremebehaviour. The subconscious is programmed with thought patterns and it createsthat physical reality. These techniques are becoming more sophisticated anddeveloped all the time. Susan Bryce highlighted one development in her articlein Exposure magazine in the June/July 1993 issue:> “Data on the relationship between heartbeats and suggestibility reveals that> music or voice timed to the rhythm of the human heart beat of 72 pulses per> minute, can affect human behaviour…Experimental commercials prepared using 72> beats per minute as pacing for drumbeats, music, and voice have been tested in> a special theatre with a random audience of housewives and husbands. The> advertisement was for a new analgesic [headache potion]. Results showed that> had the analgesic commercial been broadcast to the roughly 30 million people> watching NBC Evening News, five million would have developed headaches within> three hours of viewing it.” 12The technology has been developed to send out messages as microwaves andextremely low frequency waves (ELFs) which can speak to the mass subconsciousand cause physical illness. It is important to appreciate that the knowledgeheld secretly about the human mind and body is far more advanced than anythingwe are allowed to see in the public arena. Again, it is part of the “need toknow” policy. If someone has knowledge and technology which most people do notrealise exists, the potential for manipulation is enormous. The esotericknowledge passed through the secret society network across the years has been amajor factor in the creation of this two-speed science. The public is told abouta limited and intentionally flawed science which goes back to Darwin and others,while the far more advanced version remains hidden. The mind-spirit, the eternalpart of us, is a series of interconnecting and interacting magnetic energyfields. These react with other magnetic energy fields and this is why people wholive under electricity power lines are more prone to certain illnesses. Theelectromagnetic field thrown out by the power lines imbalances the magneticmind-spirit of the people living nearby. This imbalance is passed through themultiple levels of our being to the physical body where it manifests as canceror some other dis-ease. It can also directly affect cellular functioning tocreate physical illness. Therefore, if the manipulators can broadcast waves atcertain frequencies, they can imbalance our cellular and non-physical magneticlevels and cause physical, mental, and emotional illness. Former FBI agent, TedGunderson, has said that magnetic radioactive discs have long been used covertlyas cancer-inducing “silent killers” to remove unwanted politicians and others.These can cause cancers which grow at astonishing speeds. Experiments on theeffects of ELF waves and chemical warfare substances are routinely carried outon unsuspecting populations around the world. We hear about these things on thenews with reports of a “strange and unexplained plague/disease” which has brokenout over a small area of a country. I am told that an area of New Mexico isplagued by a “hum” that no-one can explain, which causes headaches and illnessin susceptible individuals.Some people find it hard to believe that messages can be broadcast to thesubconscious. But what is television and radio? They are words and pictureswhich are broadcast in wave form and decoded back into words and pictures bytechnology. When you think of the advanced knowledge that is secretly knownabout the nature of the human brain/psyche, is it too much of a mental leap tosee that it is possible to broadcast messages on wavelengths designed tocommunicate with the subconscious? In fact, as I explain at length in TheRobots’ Rebellion, the existence of such technology is provable. Experimentshave shown that if people are subjected to these waves for little more than aminute, they begin to react as the messages tell them to. In their minds, thesemessages appear to be their own thoughts, when in reality they are tuning intowavelengths broadcast from outside of their psyche. In such a situation, thesepeople are fully-paid-up robots. Two such techniques are called Radio HypnoticIntracerebral Control and Electronic Dissolution of Memory. Researchers say thatthese can remotely induce an hypnotic trance, deliver suggestions, and erase allmemory of both the instructions and whatever it is the person has done inresponse to those instructions. What a tool if you want to assassinate a‘troublemaker’; create some terrible event to discredit a group or person;abduct someone and blame it on ‘aliens’; or produce a problem-reaction-solutionsituation. In 1975, the journalist James Moore claimed to have secured a350-page manual on the subject from CIA sources. Part of that document said:> “Medically, these radio signals are directed at certain parts of the brain.> When a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outside> sources, such as vision, hearing, etc, an emotion is produced – anger at the> sight of a gang of boys beating an old woman, for example. The same emotion of> anger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by a> controller. You could instantly feel the same white hot anger without any> apparent reason.”It makes you wonder about some of the messages being received by mediums andchannellers. Psychically sensitive people are consciously tuning into otherwavelengths of reality. It is possible, indeed probable, that some are tuninginto wavelengths broadcast from technology on this planet. In the world ofsecret science, they know it is possible for channellers to communicate withother wavelengths of reality. They know how it is done and they usemediums/channellers in their experiments. According to the books on the mindcontrol and advanced science establishment at Montauk13 in the USA in the 1970s,the Elite scientists were able to produce the image on a computer screen of whattheir psychic was thinking. They later broadcast his thought waves from atransmitter at the base and found that people in the area had been affected intheir own minds by the thoughts being broadcast. The manipulators know also thatmore and more people are listening to what channellers say. What a greatopportunity to use this process to further manipulate. Once again, ourprotection is to think for ourselves and accept no information on face valuewithout thinking hard about it and checking the facts as best you can. Thatincludes what you read in this book.Project MKUltraAlongside the development of mass mind control techniques have come those aimedat specific individuals. The most notorious is the MKUltra programme run by theCIA. Other offshoots and variations on this have been programmes known asMonarch, Bluebird, Artichoke, MKDelta, and MKNaomi. Their even more advancedsuccessors still go on today and the victims have often hit the global headlinesas ‘lone assassins’. MKUltra began in the 1950s under the Canada-based Scottishpsychiatrist, Doctor Ewen Cameron, who became a close friend of CIA chief AllenDulles after Cameron served as the Canadian/United States psychiatrist at theNuremberg War Trials. Cameron was one of the psychiatrists who examined the manwho claimed to be Rudolf Hess. That was an appropriate appointment because whatCameron did to his ‘patients’ under the CIA’s MKUltra programme mirrored some ofwhat the Nazis did to their victims, too. Under the supervision of people likethe Dulles brothers and other members of the US Elite establishment, many of theNazi mind control experts and leading scientists were secretly removed fromGermany, as the Allies closed in. They were taken to the United States tocontinue their work into mind control and what we would call flying saucers,anti-gravity technology. Some estimate that as many as 10,000 active Nazisescaped, leaving the farce of the Nuremberg War Trials to deal out ‘justice’ tothose who had often been guilty of far less terrible crimes than the ones theAmericans had helped to escape. Yes, the Nazis carried out horrible experimentson people, including children. Of that I have no doubt. But does anyone reallythink that is not continuing in the underground establishments in America andelsewhere today? The Nazi mentality did not end in 1945. It just changedlocations and, literally, went underground.The CIA was formed out of the wartime OSS, the Office of Strategic Services.This formation of the new Central Intelligence Agency was done under thesupervision of British Intelligence, which had centuries of accumulatedexperience in covert operations. Many of the key personnel in the CIA were Naziswho had served under Hitler. One, Reinhard Gehlen of the SS, was employed byAllen Dulles to set up the CIA network in Europe after the war. I say‘employed’. In fact Gehlen has said that it was more like a partnership betweenthe CIA (headed by the Hitler-supporting Allen Dulles) and the worldwide Nazinetwork. Gehlen said that the collaboration with Dulles was a “gentlemen’sagreement” which “for a number of reasons was never set out in black andwhite…such was the element of trust that has been built up between the two sidesduring…intensive personal contact, that neither had the slightest hesitation infounding the entire operation on verbal agreement and a handshake”.14 The‘verbal agreement’ wouldn’t have anything to do with the danger of writtenevidence seeping out and blowing the story, I suppose. Writer and researcher,Noam Chomsky, says that Gehlen set up a secret US-Nazi army, which extended itsoperations to Latin America (where it supported the Nazi-type regimes imposed onthe people by the United States). The CIA was formed by Nazis, for Nazis, topromote the Nazi mentality. British Intelligence was a major instigator becauseit too is a Nazi organisation at its core, and so is the deeply corruptinternational ‘police’ operation known as Interpol, which has been headed byknown Nazis. The CIA, under Allen Dulles, funded psychiatrist Ewen Cameron fromthe early 1950s, as documents released in 1977 under the US Freedom ofInformation Act have confirmed. Most of the documents were destroyed or notreleased, but there were enough to offer just a glimpse of the nightmare thatwas MKUltra. The project included the use of drugs (like LSD) and grotesque mindmanipulation techniques known as ‘depatterning’ and ‘psychic driving’. The CIAadmitted supporting research into human mind and behaviour control at 150institutions and these included hospitals, prisons, drug companies, and 44universities. At least 185 scientists were involved. Like the Nazis’experiments, the targets were largely those considered ‘lesser human beings’such as prostitutes, foreigners, people with non-white skins, and drug addicts.Thousands of prisoners were also forced to take part, and hospital and mentalpatients were used without their consent as experiment-fodder for these crazypeople. Let no-one tell me this is not still happening today all over the world,including the UK. Soldiers in the US forces were used, too. Thousands were givenLSD in the 1970s while being told they were testing gas masks and otherprotective gear. This puts in a new light the severe damage to the health ofsoldiers given vaccinations during the Gulf War, who are now demandingcompensation.The CIA funded Ewen Cameron through an organisation called the Society for HumanEcology, yet another CIA front, which was connected to Cornell University in NewYork. Cameron and Dulles wanted to develop forms of drugs, electronicstimulation, and hypnosis which would remove a person’s natural personality andreplace it with an ‘improved one’. Another major aim was to preprogram people tocarry out assassinations which could then be written off as the work of some‘lone nutter’. This goal was quite quickly achieved. In 1969, the CIApsychologist, José Delgado, published his book, Physical Control Of The Mind:Toward A Psychocivilised Society. He wrote:> “Physical control of brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even> possible to create and follow intentions, the development of thoughts and> visual experiences. By electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures,> movements can be induced by radio command, hostility may appear and disappear,> social hierarchy can be modified, sexual behaviour may be changed, and memory,> emotions, and the thinking process may be influenced by remote control…” 15Speaking in 1966, Delgado said that his experiments “…support the distastefulconclusion that motion, emotion, and behaviour can be directed by electricalforces and that humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons”.16 Whichis precisely what happened to the killers of people like John Lennon,17 thewould-be assassin of President Reagan, and, almost certainly, the assassin ofKing Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who was shot dead in 1975. The King, who routinelyhad free copies of the Protocols distributed to foreign tourists, was murderedby a relative who travelled from America to do it. This technique is also usedto program people who run into streets or restaurants shooting in alldirections, and to carry out the most awful crimes which add to the fear and the“something must be done” mentality. This demands – and gets – harsher laws andsentences, a more armed police force, and cameras in the streets. By the way,Lennon’s assassin, Mark Chapman, was “mentally assessed” by Bernard Diamond, thesame psychiatrist who “assessed” Sirhan Sirhan, the patsy in the Bobby Kennedymurder. Just a coincidence!LSD was widely used in the Cameron experiments. It creates confusion, a keyaspect of mind control. One of the early victims was Frank Olsen, a chemistspecialising in airborne disease. He was given LSD while suffering from“depression and paranoia” and two weeks later threw himself to his death fromthe window of a New York hotel. The CIA funded a series of ‘safe houses’ forexperimentation in San Francisco and New York. Here MKUltra operatives observedthrough two-way mirrors how the clients of CIA-hired prostitutes responded afterbeing secretly given LSD. At Ewen Cameron’s headquarters, the Allan MemorialInstitute in Montreal, Canada, he ‘treated’ unsuspecting people for a variety ofmental problems and systematically dismantled their personalities in MKUltraexperiments. In the Observer magazine of October 16th 1994, writer ElizabethNickson told the stories of many of Cameron’s victims, including her own mother.One patient, a woman from Vancouver, was suffering from post-natal depressionand fatigue. She was kept in a drug-induced sleep for 86 days by Cameron andwhen he was finished with her, she had lost all memory of her life, includingthe ability to read and write. She even needed toilet training. As a result ofthis pressure on her family, she lost her husband and six children. This was thesame Ewen Cameron who was fêted by his fellow psychiatrists and made presidentof the string of leading psychiatric bodies, including the World PsychiatricAssociation. The president and directors of the MKUltra project included thepresident of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Centre and the head of theSmithsonian Institute. This was the establishment top brass, not some madprofessor working alone.One of Cameron’s techniques links in with what I said earlier. He used a tapemachine called the Cererophone which was placed under the pillow of the sleepingvictim to repeat messages over and over. He would also record a key phrase usedby the victim in conversations with him and play it back at 30 second intervalsas the victim slept. This was “psychic driving”. The result was that the victimbecame obsessed with the phrase and could not think about anything else. Suchwas the emotional result that drugs would be used to sedate the person. Psychicdriving, the input of the ‘new’ personality, often followed electro-therapy, thedestruction of the natural personality. This was called the “depatterning”process.Cameron used a technique called the Page-Russell shock treatment, named afterthe two British doctors who developed it. The victims would be given an initialelectric shock, followed by five to nine smaller ones, two or three times a dayfor up to thirty days. Hospital workers at the time have reported that thescreaming echoed around the hospital. The ‘patients’ would try to escape fromthis horror. Once this depatterning was completed and the victim thoroughlyconfused, a helmet would be clamped on their heads and negative messages wouldbe repeated into the victim’s mind for maybe twenty hours a day. These messageswould repeat phrases like “My mother hates me, my husband hates me, I am afailure”, and so on, using recordings of the victim’s own voice. Cameron wouldalso wire their legs and give them an electric shock after the completion ofeach message.With the old personality now destroyed, the process would be used to build a newone in Cameron’s image. And this, lest we forget, was funded by the CIA withtaxpayers’ money at the behest of Allen Dulles, the man who, with others,controlled the Nuremberg War Trials that sentenced scores of lower-ranked Nazisto death for doing far less than he and Cameron were doing. All of thiscontinues in a much more advanced way today. I have been told of mind controlresearch of a similar kind in some UK universities and if you know more, pleasetell me.Most people have no idea how easy the law makes it for you to be imprisoned in amental institution. It really is so easy. A friend of mine who was going througha traumatic spiritual awakening (he was seeing the world for what it really is)was pressured by his family to agree to attend a private mental hospital. Hechose to go for their sake. But when he decided to leave the hospital afterchatting with the doctors, he was forcibly stopped. He was also forced to takedrugs. What the staff of that hospital were doing was perfectly legal. Once youagree to have treatment at such a place, you lose all your rights to leave ifthe staff decide that you should not. As the doctors at that level of theprofession largely have no idea about the nature of the psyche, despite beingcalled ‘psychiatrists’, they can imprison you and force you to take drugs to‘treat’ quite natural phenomena. If we are not vigilant, the excuse of ‘mentalillness’ will be used to intern those who say they can communicate with otherfrequencies [‘schizophrenia’] and those who claim there is a global conspiracy[‘paranoia’]. Someone like me who talks about both becomes a ‘paranoidschizophrenic’, which is exactly how they imprisoned dissenters in thepsychiatric hospitals of the Soviet Union.Eventually, at the start of the Bush presidency, the CIA settled out of courtwith nine of the victims of MKUltra for the largest sum of money possiblewithout the approval of the Attorney General. Another 69 are still battling forcompensation. This is not helped by the admission of Richard Helms, the CIAchief at the time of Watergate, that he destroyed most of the MKUltra documentsin 1973. What we are looking at here is the sharp end of the policy to turn thehuman race from unique and free-thinking expressions of creation into a herd ofsheep and robots. It is a combination of technology, engineered events, andcontrol of both politics and (crucially) the media. Behind it is the familiarroll call. The document Silent Weapons For A Quiet War reveals the input of theRockefeller Foundation in funding research through Harvard University into thepotential for computers to control human thinking. The aim is to have physicalmoney replaced entirely by credit card electronic money, and then to replacecredit cards and identity cards with a microchip just under the skin. IntelCorporation was awarded a five-year contract in 1994, to develop just such adevice at its Rio Rancho, New Mexico, facility. This chip would be linked to aglobal computer using the excuse that all financial transactions had to beregistered at the new world central bank. The computer would know everythingthere is to know about us at all times and would be able to send messages theother way, from the computer to us, feeding us messages and programming ourconsciousnesses. Robots would be exactly the word.This prospect is nothing new. CIA psychologist Dr José Delgado said in 1966 thatthe day would come when brain control could be turned over to non-humanoperators, by establishing two-way communication between the implanted brain anda computer. In the 1970s, Sweden was stunned to hear that microchips were beingimplanted into hospital patients without their knowledge, as part of a mindcontrol experiment. This was sanctioned by Olof Palme, the Bilderberger PrimeMinister of Sweden. The dangers are so potent and so obvious. As Senator Sam J.Ervin, the head of a Senate subcommittee on behaviour modification, said in1973:> “…behavioural technology…in the United States today touches upon the most> basic sources of individuality, and the very core of personal freedom. To my> mind the most serious threat…is the power this technology gives one man to> impose his views and values on another…If our society is to remain free, one> man must not be empowered to change another man’s personality and dictate the> values, thoughts, and feelings of others.” 18Throughout the Silent Weapons document and the Elite philosophy in general, wesee the desire to do exactly that. We see the theme of the chosen elitecontrolling the ‘stupid herd’ in all areas of our lives. It starts with thechildren in the schools and the young people in the universities. Get ’em youngand you have got them for good. I never cease to wonder when I speak atuniversities how the majority of students are already programmed to think likeclones of the system by the age of seventeen and eighteen. Their inability tothink for themselves is quite stunning, with very honourable exceptions. SilentWeapons For A Quiet War emphasises to its own agents the importance ofcontrolling what children and young people are told. The teachers are trained tothink in a certain way and to believe that the information they arecommunicating is true. Even if they doubt it, the authorities insist that it istaught anyway. “If you don’t like it Mr or Mrs Teacher, get out and we willreplace you with someone who will do as they are told.” As the rock group, PinkFloyd, say in their well-known song, children are programmed by the educationsystem to be “Just another brick in the wall”. But how much debate goes on aboutthese matters? Teachers, parents, the teaching unions, and the politicians go onendlessly about the funding of schools and the shortage of school books. Whereis the concern about what is actually taught in the schools and what is writtenin those books? And yet there is no other subject on Earth that is moreimportant than the programming of the human mind. From that all else comes. TheSilent Weapons document describes the mind-controlling technique brilliantly. Itsays of the Quiet War:> “It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing,> instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by> a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking> magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious noises, causes no> obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with> anyone’s daily social life.> “Yet it makes an unmistakable ‘noise’, causes unmistakable physical and mental> damage, and unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable> to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot> comprehend the weapon, and therefore cannot believe they are being attacked> and subdued by a weapon.> “The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but because of> the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling> in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do> not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to> defend themselves against it.> “When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its> presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the> pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.> Therefore the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the> vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing,> understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social> energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.”In others words, divide and rule, and introduce your global dictatorship via thestepping-stones approach and few will realise what is really going on until itis too late. In fact, many will even laugh at or condemn those who point outwhat is happening. Well the readers of this book, and many others like it, doknow what is really going on. And if we are truly committed to a better worldand to freedom of thought and expression, the information is impossible toignore. The work we all have to do to break the hold the programmers have on somany human minds is considerable, but it is perfectly achievable – and will beachieved – if we are prepared to get involved. There is nothing more powerfulthan a human mind determined to think and act for itself. Such a phenomenon is amanipulator’s nightmare and, like everyone on this planet, you have that power.You only have to use it.> SOURCES> > > 1 See Dr John Coleman’s Conspirators’ Hierarchy: The Story Of The> > > Committee Of 300> > > 2 The Sunday Telegraph (February 5th 1995)> > > 3 Oswald Le Winter, CIA operative 1968-85, speaking on the> > > documentary, The Maltese Double Cross, which was shown to British MPs in> > > 1994.> > > 4 Ibid> > > 5 There was another air disaster in the 1980s, which cost 329 lives.> > > It was the bombing of the Air India flight off Ireland in 1985 which has> > > since been traced to a paramilitary camp in Alabama where mercenaries are> > > trained for terrorist activities.> > > 6 Noam Chomsky, Letters From Lexington (AK Press, Edinburgh, Scotland)> > > p119–120> > > 7 The Rockefellers, CBS (Friday, December 28th 1973).

The plan has been to engineer events and propaganda which devalue theword cult in the public mind and then, once that is achieved, to apply the label“cult” to any group or organisation which the Elite wish to discredit anddestroy. That means anyone who is challenging the status quo or living in waysthat undermine centralised control.The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition of cult is “A system of religiousworship as expressed in ceremonies; devotion or homage to person or thing”. Soevery religion is a cult by that definition, and so is the banking and financialsystem, where they are devoted and pay homage to a ‘thing’: money. TheAll-Seeing Eye secret society network is a cult because it worships theLuciferic, Prison Warder Consciousness through ceremonies, devotion, and homage.The whole of the United Kingdom is a cult, or at least those many people who aredevoted to and pay homage to the monarchy. Almost everything becomes a cultunder that criterion. However, that is not what the manipulators want you tothink. They have used events to turn the word cult into a much narrower meaning– dangerous religious ‘nutters’, brainwashed and programmed to worship a messiahfigure. The plan is well advanced in feeding the public mind with such messagesto the point where anything labelled a cult is subject to a reflex actionresponse of: “Dangerous nutters – something must be done”.There are three ways you can manipulate events to suit that plan. You can set upthe ‘cult’ from the start and control the whole thing; you can infiltrate agroup or community with agents provocateur who then act in ways which discreditthe innocent members, or you can simply blame a group of people or sect forsomething they did not do. Whichever way you choose, the outcome is the same –the word ‘cult’ is further devalued in the collective consciousness. Two eventswhich have been enormously successful in poisoning the public to the word ‘cult’have been the Jonestown Massacre of 1978 and Waco in 1993. The Jonestownencampment in Guyana was the headquarters of the People’s Temple sect controlledby its ‘messiah’ figure, Jim Jones. Its members, overwhelmingly black, hadfollowed Jones to Guyana from the original base in California, then under thegovernorship of Ronald Reagan. An estimated 900 people died at Jonestown onNovember 18th 1978, in what was said to have been a “mass suicide” achievedthrough cyanide poisoning and shooting. At Waco in Texas 15 years later, we wereasked to believe the same official story of a “mass suicide” by the BranchDavidian sect run by its ‘messiah’ figure, David Koresh. Who benefits frompeople believing these official explanations? Those who want the word ‘cult’ tomean ‘dangerous nutters’. Intriguingly, therefore, we can point out manyconnections with the intelligence agencies.One of the main financial backers of Jonestown was Dr Lawrence Layton senior,who was formerly in charge of research and development at one of the US Army’stop chemical and biological warfare research centres at the Dugway ProvingGround in Utah. This has been connected by researchers to cattle mutilationsblamed on ‘aliens’, disease warfare, and genetic experimentation. Layton wasalso director of the Missile and Satellite Development at the Navy PropellantDivision at Indian Head, Maryland. His wife’s fortune came, in part, from theI.G. Farben cartel. Their son, Lawrence Layton Jr, was in the sect firing squadwhich executed Congressional Representative, Leo Ryan, who had travelled toJonestown to investigate the People’s Temple. Ryan was seriously unpopular withthe CIA. He had co-authored the Hughes-Ryan Amendment which obliged the CIA togive Congress prior notice of covert operations. What a coincidence that Ryan, aman battling to make the CIA accountable to the people, should be in Jonestown,Guyana, at just the moment the shooting started.The Laytons are a prominent Southern family who fought for the Confederatesduring the civil war. They have many connections with the intelligence agencies.Lawrence Layton Jr’s sister, Debora Layton Blakey, was married to George PhilipBlakey, the man who placed the downpayment on the property at Jonestownpurchased by Jim Jones. Blakey was a former contract agent for the CIA in Angolaand a number of researchers claim that Jonestown was used as a cover to train‘rebels’ for the CIA covert operations in Angola. There are other CIAconnections to the Jonestown massacre. Richard Dwyer, the deputy head of the USEmbassy in Guyana and the local CIA chief, was known to be involved. On a taperecorded at Jonestown when the violence flared, the voice of Jim Jones can beheard shouting, “Get Dwyer out of here”. By his own admission, Dwyer was seenstripping the dead of their wallets and other identification on the orders ofZbigniew Brzezinski, a founder of the Trilateral Commission and then JimmyCarter’s National Security Advisor.1 The People’s Temple members were active intheir support of the Guyana President, Forbes Burnham, who openly admitted hislinks with the CIA. When Jim Jones went to Brazil in 1961 “to administer to thedowntrodden”, his transportation and food were paid for by the US Embassy, andhe told local residents that he was working for Naval Intelligence. He wasaccompanied by his lifelong friend, Dan Mitrione, who worked for the CIAinstructing Third World police forces on interrogation and torture techniques.The connections between Jones, Jonestown, and the intelligence agencies aremany. James T. Richardson, professor of sociology at the University of Nevada,published a study of the People’s Temple in the Journal For The Scientific StudyOf Religion, in 1980. He wrote:> “Because of the negligence of US officials in not ordering immediate autopsies> on those who died in Guyana, we will never know how many died of suicide and> how many were murdered. Dr Leslie Mootoo, Chief Medical Examiner for the> Guyana Government and the first medically-trained person to arrive at> Jonestown after the event, told reporters: ‘I do not believe there were ever> more than 200 persons who died voluntarily.’ He said this after inspecting a> number of bodies and the scene of their deaths. This question has been most> fully discussed in a series of articles by Deirdre Griswold in Worker’s> World…a series which also poses some questions about possible CIA involvement> in the Jonestown tragedy. Griswold, who accuses the US Government of> deliberately destroying evidence by not performing autopsies, points out a> number of intriguing ties between the People’s Temple and the CIA. She says> some of the white leaders at Jonestown may have been CIA agents, and Jonestown> may have been a pawn in political struggles involving the US, Cuba, and> Guyana…”There is also evidence that Jonestown was a mind control experiment and a partof MKUltra. Large quantities of psychiatric drugs were found there, enough todrug 200,000 people a year, and the members were known to wear identificationtags similar to those that people are given in hospital. Indeed, the Jonestowncomplex included a substantial and sophisticated hospital while conditions inthe rest of the compound were poor. The mix of blacks, women, and prisoners,mirrored the victims chosen for MKUltra mind experimentation. The blacks werebound and gagged when they arrived in Guyana and taken to the compound to work18 hours a day. The links between Jonestown, MKUltra, and Nazi-style ideologyare explored by Michael Meiers in Was Jonestown A CIA Medical Experiment? AReview Of The Evidence. He argues that Jonestown was the final field experimentof MKUltra and that Jim Jones was a long-time CIA asset who had been secretlysupported by Ronald Reagan’s California administration in the years before theoperation moved to Guyana. Meiers says the mind control story can be traced backat least to 1965 when Jones and the People’s Temple first moved to Ukiah,California. He reports:> “…the group immediately infiltrated the Mendocino State Mental Hospital which> would provide not only test persons [TPs as the Nazis called them] for his> [Jones’s] preliminary medical experiments, but also a training ground for> medical technicians needed for the ultimate experiment. Within a very short> period of time, every employee at the hospital was a member of the People’s> Temple. From nurses to therapists, from counsellors to cleaning women, every> worker on the facility was replaced by a Temple member. California virtually> gave the Mendocino State Mental Hospital to Jim Jones.” 2The aftermath and official explanations for the massacre were a familiar tale ofprovable lies and contradictions. The number of people reported to have beenliving in Jonestown was around 1100. This was based, it would appear, on apassport count. But after the tragedy, the number of dead was given as only 400and later 913. As many as 200 were ‘missing’. This is a significant figurebecause the elite guard around Jim Jones numbered between 120 and 200. While thePeople’s Temple membership was predominantly black, the elite guard wasoverwhelmingly white. Elite guard or CIA guard? Despite the official figure of900 dead, only 400 were found and the speculation was rife over what happened tothe other 500. It was at this point, according to testimony by the militarycommander investigating Jonestown, that he was told by US government official,Robert Pastor, to stop identifying the bodies. Pastor was the top aide toZbigniew Brzezinski. Surely identification of the bodies was essential if youreally wanted to know what happened! In the days following this order fromBrzezinski’s aide, the missing 500 bodies were miraculously found. Where hadthey been hiding, pray? I promise you I am not joking here. They were found,according to the official version, underneath the other 400! You only have tolook at the pictures of the first bodies to be found to see that there is no waythey were lying on top of another 500. But that is the official version to thisday.Ladies and gentlemen, they are just laughing at us. The charred body said to bethat of Jim Jones was never properly identified and he almost certainly escapedwith the white guards. The whole thing stinks, just like the assassinations ofMartin Luther King and JFK which, ‘coincidentally’, were being reinvestigated atthe time of Jonestown by a House Select Committee. One attorney, Mark Lane, hadconnections with both Jonestown and the assassination hearings. He was theattorney for the People’s Temple and for the ‘patsy’ James Earl Ray, the alleged‘lone assassin’ of Dr King. Mark Lane, who has also worked for the LibertyLobby, the publishers of The Spotlight newspaper, called the People’s Temple a“paradise on Earth”. This so discredited him after Jonestown that his contentionthat James Earl Ray was innocent was subsequently met with disdain by many.There were rumours that the People’s Temple included a death squad whichdisposed of anyone who threatened or spoke badly about the sect. The governmenthas always denied that, but Jim Jones was known to have a hit list and theleading names on it died violently in the months that followed the massacre. Atthe top of the list was George Moscone, the Mayor of San Francisco. He was shotdead nine days after the tragedy. Moscone’s election campaign had been backed bysubstantial donations from the People’s Temple and he had made Jim Jones thehead of the San Francisco Housing Authority. Many of Jones’s followers were alsoemployed by the City Welfare Department and they used this privilege to recruitthe poor and homeless to the sect. The second name on the Jones hit list wasJenny Mills, a former official of the People’s Temple, who wrote a book with herhusband, My Six Years With God, which was extremely critical of Jones and hisgroup. In the summer of 1979, Jenny Mills, her husband, and her daughter wereshot dead at their home in Berkeley. Their murder remains unsolved. Ajournalist, Kathy Hunter, who had reported the deaths of seven members who hadbeen killed for trying to leave the original headquarters compound inCalifornia, also died in strange circumstances. It is the old, old, story wehave seen repeated so many times in this book. But ask most people today and ifthey remember the Jonestown Massacre, they will speak of religious ‘nutters’ whocommitted suicide while under the influence of a ‘mad messiah’ and cult leader.That is what they are supposed to think.Jonestown, the massacre, and its repercussions, served the manipulators well. Itwas a cover to train mercenaries for the CIA’s covert activities in Angola; itprovided on-the-spot political support for CIA asset, Forbes Burnham; iteliminated the CIA’s tenacious political opponent, Leo Ryan; it undermined theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations by discrediting James Earl Ray’sattorney, Mark Lane; it gave valuable information about mind control to theMKUltra Project; and it further poisoned the public mind to the word ‘cult’.You will find many of the elements of Jonestown in the story of Waco. On April19th 1993, more than 80 men, women, and children were burnt alive when the USgovernment, in the form of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, andFirearms (BATF), attacked the Mount Carmel compound of the Branch Davidians,near Waco, Texas. We are asked to believe once again that this was a ‘masssuicide’ by a group of crazed and brainwashed followers of a weird and dangerous‘messiah’ figure, David Koresh. I could not disagree more with the views thatDavid Koresh was supposed to have had (if what is claimed is true). He appearsto have been a very mixed up man. But the focus on Koresh has been used toobscure the issue of how and why all those people died at the hands ofgovernment agencies.It is the same with all these mind-manipulating events. At the time they happen,the official version dominates the papers and the television screens. The publicsoak it up and overwhelmingly accept it. Then, as the weeks pass and moreopen-minded researchers begin to uncover the true background, a very differentversion of events emerges. However, the official version is communicated to acolossal audience all over the world at the height of the publicity and coverageof the event, while the true, or at least truer, version comes to light laterwhen interest has died down. The mainstream media usually ignores suchinformation and the challenge to the official whitewash is marginalised intobooks like this or in magazines selling to a relatively small audience. So whilethe alternative explanations, even proof, exists to demolish the propaganda as apack of lies, the mass of the people never know that this is the case. They goon believing that what they were told in the beginning continues to be the truthof what happened. Because of this, the vast majority of people still believethat Waco was the mass suicide of a mad cult. But was it?The BATF first used guns to attack the Branch Davidian compound on February 28th1993. This attack was ‘justified’ by official claims that the sect members hadbroken gun laws. They bought and sold guns to earn money, as many do in Texas. Idon’t understand how a religious group can buy and sell guns, or even own them,but what they did was legal. Yet here were agents of the BATF trying to shoottheir way into the compound. And, according to Ron Engleman, a presenter at KGBSRadio in Dallas, the BATF had rung the media to tell them about the raid. That’swhy the cameras were there. An investigative video called Waco: The Big Lie, wascompiled by attorney Linda Thompson, of the American Justice Federation. Again,Linda Thompson’s belief system and approach to life could not be further from myown, but if we are only going to accept the research of those we agree with oneverything, we become a dupers dream. Her video uses footage from the Februaryattack and the mass murder at the end of the 51-day siege that followed. I don’tnecessarily agree with everything the video claims and there are many questionsabout it I would like to ask, but it certainly reveals a very different versionof what happened.In the first attack in the February, we see four BATF men dressed in black onthe Mount Carmel building. They are all armed, but no shots are coming from thebuilding. Three of these men are seen to climb through a window while the fourthstays on the roof outside. When his colleagues have disappeared through thewindow, he throws in a grenade and begins to open fire in that direction.Bullets burst through the wall from the inside. But is this the Branch Davidiansreturning fire or the three BATF men retaliating in response to their ‘buddy’s’actions? All three of those men who entered that window were found dead, thevideo claimed. Why would their colleague kill them, if that was what happened?Only he knows and since he was dressed in black with only his eyes uncovered,no-one outside of the authorities knows who he is. However, according to LindaThompson, the three men who were killed were all Bill Clinton bodyguards duringhis presidential campaign. Some mainstream journalists have denied this, but youhave a right to know that these other explanations exist.During the weeks of the siege which followed this initial raid, the officialstory of Waco went around the world. Not only were American minds conditioned tothe negative meaning of ‘cult’, so was anyone who read a paper or watched thetelevision anywhere on the planet. The propaganda against Koresh and the BranchDavidians was incessant. At night, the compound was floodlit to keep everyoneawake and recordings of rabbits being slaughtered were broadcast at full volume.These are the sort of minds that control ‘law enforcement’ agencies like theBATF, the FBI and the CIA. Eventually, Bill Clinton and his WebbHubbell-selected attorney general, Janet Reno, gave permission for the actionwhich was to cost the lives of so many innocent people. Janet Reno said theaction was taken “for the sake of the children”. These were the same childrenwho were burnt alive soon afterwards. This justification of saving the childrencame from the claims that the Davidians were guilty of child abuse. This may ormay not have been true in the case of David Koresh, but Janet Reno has sinceadmitted there was no evidence to prove this at the time of the massacre, andthe ‘evidence’ put forward since is extremely questionable, often provablyuntrue.The public were not told as events in Waco unfolded, that surveillancetechnology is now extremely advanced and by using tiny cameras, sensitive soundequipment, and infra red cameras, the BATF and FBI knew exactly what washappening inside the building and where all the people were gathered. The tanksattacked the compound early on April 19th. On the Linda Thompson video, we see atank at 6am moving back and forth over a small area at the front of thebuilding. This, Thompson claims, was directly over the underground bunker wherethe women and children would have been sheltering at night from the floodlightsand the noise. The tank was almost certainly crushing the bunker and trappingthe people. Why else would it have been going back and forth on the same spot?We then see other tanks knocking down the walls of the building and firesbreaking out which quickly consume the complex, killing all inside. Who startedthe fire? It was said to be mass suicide, but why does it appear from the videofootage that some tanks had flame throwers on the front? And why was theParkland Hospital in Dallas called by the FBI at six o’clock that morning andasked how many beds they had in their burns unit? 3 Again, some journalistschallenge this version of events, but the public has a right to hear all sides,not just the government’s. Then they can make up their own minds.The mind manipulators squeezed full value from this propaganda coup. DavidKoresh was compared with mass murderers of history and Waco was actuallycompared with Bosnia by Steven V. Roberts, a senior writer at US News And WorldReport.4 Unbelievable. He also asked in the article: “How does a society dealwith a messianic personality who resists all attempts at persuasion orpressure?” The answer, Mr Roberts, is that they usually elect him President ofthe United States. Talking of which, Bill Clinton, who had sanctioned theattack, sought to justify what followed by saying: “There is, unfortunately, arise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. We may have to confront itagain”. Well done, Bill. Exactly to script. I think that State Representative,John Padfield who certainly didn’t support the views of the Branch Davidians,was much closer to the truth when he said:> “I think the BATF intentionally went way beyond their bounds to put on a huge> media show just to demonise guns and self-sufficient people and to win favor> with the new anti-gun President. I really believe the evidence will show BATF> had no intention of serving a warrant or conducting themselves in a> professional manner. After all, if Koresh was such a dangerous person, why> didn’t they simply pick him up when he went jogging or to town?” 5It was not the first time the deadly duo of BATF and FBI had been responsiblefor killing innocent people in a siege. There is the infamous Randy Weaver case,when 400 agents were deployed against the Weaver family in their mountain-tophome in Idaho in August 1992. Randy Weaver, a court later heard, had been set upas an agent provocateur by the BATF. The idea was to frame him on gun charges toforce him to become an informer. But he refused and eventually the FBI-BATFterrorist squad killed Weaver’s 14-year-old son as he was running away from themback to the house. They killed his wife while she was holding a baby in thedoorway, killed the family dog, and wounded Weaver himself and a friend, KevinHarris. From what I have heard, I would agree with little that Randy Weaverbelieved in, but so what? If we don’t treat all people equally, whether we agreewith them or not, we create a tyranny.In 1994, we were told of another ‘mass suicide’ by a ‘cult’ in Switzerland.Given what I knew about Jonestown and Waco, I watched the coverage of the storywith added interest. When the story broke, it was a ‘mass suicide’ by followersof two ‘messianic’ leaders. The next day, it was suddenly a mass murder by thetwo leaders and an international police hunt was launched. A day or so later,one of the two leaders was found to be among the dead. Now it was mass murder bythe other leader. Another few days passed and he was also found to be among thedead. In December 1995, another 16 members, or alleged members, were found shotdead in France. So who killed them? No-one seems to know or care, but such isthe attention span and the retention of detail by newspaper readers andtelevision viewers that most will have absorbed only the theme that here wasanother mad, bad, and dangerous cult. This lack of attention to detail by mostpeople, in the face of the tidal wave of information with which we are delugedevery day, is a highly effective tool of the mind manipulators. According toProfessor Massimo Introvigne at the Centre for the Study of New Religion inTurin, Italy, there are at least circumstantial and historical connectionsbetween the Order of the Solar Temple involved in the Swiss tragedy and both theFrench secret service and the P2 Freemasonry cell.6 We have since had theaccusations against a Japanese sect over the poison gas released into theunderground system and by the time you read this there may well have been otherstories to devalue the word ‘cult’. Either this Supreme Truth organisation is anElite front (very possible) or it is the victim of anti-‘cult’ propaganda. TheBATF agent, Dan Curtis, summed up the game when he defined a cult at the trialof eleven Branch Davidians as “a group of people who live together differentlyfrom the rest of society”.7 And that would never do, would it? Just as the Eliteseek to destroy countries who are in danger of setting a good example ofalternative lifestyles and economics, so they do the same with groups living inways which show that the status quo is not the only option. ‘Choice’ becomes‘bad’, ‘different’ becomes ‘dangerous’.The media yet again play their role to perfection as the messenger boys andgirls of this propaganda. When the Waco story broke, I was questioned by themedia about my ‘cult’. I have no ‘cult’ of any kind because I don’t worship orpay homage to anything, but I was described by the Daily Record newspaper inScotland as a ‘Cult Lord’, and I found a picture of myself in the paper next tothat of the murderer, Charles Manson! I was on the same page as David Koresh,too. Can you believe these people who run newspapers? On the day the ‘masssuicide’ was discovered in the Swiss community, I was asked by the supposedly‘thinking person’s’ BBC news programme, Newsnight, to be interviewed about such‘cults’, presumably because I was considered by them to be a ‘cult leader’.Maybe they read the Daily Record. Talk about barely one-dimensional! It issimply pathetic. But what a dream to have that media mindset available if youare a manipulator. I am a leader of nothing, except my own mind. The media oughtto try it sometime. It’s wonderful.In the light of this background to the ‘cult’ tragedies, it is important that‘cult-buster’ groups are questioned and investigated just as much as the ‘cults’they attack. These groups have sprung up all over the world. I can understandthe motivation behind some of them because there are mind controlling sectspreying on the emotions of people, particularly the young, and many, if notmost, of these can be linked with the intelligence agencies. They are part ofproblem-reaction-solution with the Elite creating or exploiting the ‘cult’ andcontrolling the opposition to them, the ‘cult-busters’. One of the latter is theAmerica-based Cult Awareness Network (CAN), a front for the Anti-DefamationLeague. Glenn Krawczyk, a freelance writer and former researcher with thesatellite TV science programme, Beyond 2000, has made a study of CAN, and hisfindings were published in the October-November 1994 edition of Nexus magazine.8He found one of the prime movers behind CAN is Doctor Louis Jolyn “Jolly” West,who is connected to a similar group called the American Family Foundation. Westwas the psychiatrist the authorities chose to ‘analyse’ Jack Ruby in Dallas,after Ruby had murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, the ‘patsy’ in the Kennedyassassination. In 1973, West was Director of the University of CaliforniaNeuropsychiatric Institute and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at theUniversity, from where came Tom Grubbs, a psychologist linked to Jonestown.West proposed a Center for the Study and Reduction of Violence, at which heplanned to treat ‘undesirable behaviour’ with the latest neuropsychiatric andgenetic manipulation techniques. Goodness knows what he would have got up to,and yet he had enthusiastic support from California Governor, Ronald Reagan.Fortunately the California legislature could see what was happening and labelledthe idea, “Nazi science”. West knew all about that because he had been, asconfirmed by CIA records, a long-time operative on the agency’s mind controlprogrammes, including MKUltra. Dr West’s specialities include interrogationusing deprivation techniques, hypnosis and psychoactive drugs, behaviourmodification through electrical stimulation of the brain, and electronic devicesto track and monitor his victims. That is the mentality of one of the mainfigures behind the Cult Awareness Network (CAN). So what constitutes a ‘cult’ inthis man’s misguided mind? According to his own published papers, they includethe following:> “1: neo-Christian cults; 2: Hindu and Eastern religious cults; 3: occult,> witchcraft and satanism cults; 4: spiritualist cults; 5: Zen and other> Sino-Japanese philosophical cults; 6: race cults; 7: flying saucer and outer> space cults; 8: psychological cults [like CAN, presumably]; 9: political> cults; and 10: certain communal and self-help or self-improvement groups that> become transformed into cults.”What about the “walking to the shops to buy tonight’s dinner” cults? I can’tthink why he missed that one. The list confirms what I was saying earlier aboutthe way the Elite want to discredit the word ‘cult’ and then apply it to anygroup or lifestyle they wish to undermine and destroy. The aim is to marginaliseand wipe out all thinking that challenges the desired norm. One of West’scronies, Dr Martin Orne, a former head of the Office of Naval Research’sCommittee on Hypnosis, said: “Even in present day America, when an individualhears God speak to him, it is a toss-up whether he will become a successfulleader of a new religious cult or will come to the attention of a psychiatricunit”. It was a ‘deprogrammer’ or, in truth, a reprogrammer with CAN, calledRick Ross who tipped off the BATF about guns at the Waco Compound. It was Rosswho ‘deprogrammed’ 14-year-old Kiri Jewell, who claimed that Koresh sexuallyabused her, ‘evidence’ which has been seriously questioned. Ross was working atthe time with Priscilla Coates, a national spokesperson for the Cult AwarenessNetwork. The use of ‘lethal force’ against the Branch Davidians was recommendedby Patricia Ryan, the President of CAN.9Significantly, it was during Dr “Jolly” West’s campaign for the ‘behaviourmodification’ unit in California in 1974, that the Symbionese Liberation Army(SLA) came to public prominence when they kidnapped Patricia Hearst, thedaughter of the newspaper tycoon, Randolf Hearst. This happened in the samestate of California under Ronald Reagan, from where the Peoples’ Temple of JimJones also emerged. The SLA was supposed to be a Marxist urban warfare group andthe propaganda about them terrorised the state for months. In fact, only ninepeople were involved. Patricia Hearst became active in SLA actions after herabduction. This included an armed bank robbery and the stories began to flowabout her being brainwashed by this ‘cult’. The SLA was destroyed when 150officers and agents expelled 5,000 rounds of ammunition in front of livetelevision cameras during prime time. Later Patricia Hearst was given a mentalexamination by two ‘experts’ on brainwashing…Dr Louis Jolyn West and Dr MartinOrne, of the Cult Awareness Network.The founder of CAN, Ted Patrick, has a long list of criminal convictions againsthim which result from his ‘counselling’ techniques on cult ‘victims’. Theseinclude kidnapping, conspiracy, false imprisonment, abduction and assault,possession of cocaine, and violation of probation. A case brought againstPatrick in 1976 revealed that he had held one of his abductees prisoner for 86days at 12 locations and subjected her to “frightful experiences”.10 These arejust some of the people who are protecting the innocent from cults! You nowincreasingly see the word cult used to discredit groups and alternativecommunities that are anything but ‘brainwashed dangerous nutters’. Once the word‘cult’ is applied, it is considered OK to treat the people involved as subhuman,with no rights as human beings. Yet, as US judge T.S. Ellis told ‘deprogrammer’Galen Kelly: “One man’s cult is another man’s community, no matter how wacky youor I might think that is”.There are other groups dubbed as ‘cults’, however, which suit the Elite and theyare allowed to become global empires. One is the Unification Church, started inKorea and now based in New York. It is led by Sun Myung Moon and is better knownas the Moonies. This is an extremely sinister organisation, in my view, with NewWorld Order overtones. On January 15th 1995, the London Sunday Express revealedthat the former British Prime Minister, Edward Heath (Bil), had been paidhandsomely to make the keynote speech at the Moonies’ Summit Council for WorldPeace in Korea. In March 1994, he also spoke at Sun Myung Moon’s World PeaceConference, where the main speaker was the former Soviet Union leader, MikhailGorbachev, the friend of Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller. The Knight ofMalta and former US Secretary of State and Supreme Allied Commander of NATO,Alexander Haig, has spoken at Moonie events. So has the former US DefenseSecretary, Frank Carlucci (CFR, TC). The Unification Church has a worldwidebusiness empire which includes The Washington Times, The New York City Tribune,and The Middle East Times. Their list of front groups and businesses in theNameBase system runs to 28 pages and 667 names.11 Moon’s son and heir apparent,Justin, runs an arms company in Massachusetts called Saeilo Incorporated.12 Oncemore the links with the intelligence agencies of the Elite have been identified.The Moonies paid $50,000,000 to buy the University of Bridgeport in Connecticutand one of the new trustees named was Jack E. Thomas, the assistant chief ofstaff at US airforce intelligence, and special assistant to the CIA director fornine years. The Unification Church has support from the South Korean CentralIntelligence Agency (KCIA). Bo Hi Pak, the KCIA liaison officer to USintelligence stationed at the Korean Embassy in Washington, became one of Moon’stop aides and president of The Washington Times. Moon’s editor at the WashingtonTimes is Arnaud de Borchgrave, a former leading correspondent of theCIA-connected Newsweek, owned by the Washington Post company of Katherine Graham(CFR, TC, Bil). De Borchgrave is closely connected by marriage to the Rothschildfamily, the longtime and leading financial and political backers of Israel, astate they were, in effect, responsible for creating.The Church of Scientology (established by L. Ron Hubbard) was named by formerCIA officer, Miles Copeland, as one of two religious-type groups with which theCIA made ‘arrangements’. The other was called Moral Re-Armament. The Elite makesure they work through both sides whenever possible, in this case the ‘cult’ andthe ‘cult-busters’. In doing so they control the actions and events the publicmind sees and absorbs. From the evidence that I have seen and my own intuition,I sense the time approaching when a coordinated global campaign will beactivated which seeks to discredit all alternative thinking, movements, andlifestyles. It is a time to be strong and determined and allow the power of loveto win through.This same technique is being used against investigators into the globalconspiracy. As more of the web and background is unravelled, there is adesperate need by the Elite to discredit this information by discrediting themessengers. It is a technique known as “Ad Hominem” – if a truth you don’t likeis being communicated, attack the messenger, not the message. I am now seeing anexpanding range of articles about ‘conspiracy theorists’ and how they are all‘Right wing extremists’. As with the word ‘cult’, the propagandists want tostimulate an immediate public reaction of ‘Nazi’ to anyone who revealsinformation about the global manipulation. This is where the ‘Left’, those Icall the Robot Radicals, are so helpful to the Elite. They parrot this nonsenseby reflex action. Another buzz term is “historical revisionist”. This is alsobeing used in a negative way. What such a person is doing is challenging theconventional version of history. Do those who speak of historical revisionistsas Nazis really believe that everything we are told about history is true?Surely not. Then why can’t we be adult enough to look at what the revisionistssay and make up our own mind about what we think is right? Because the Elitewould lose control of history, that’s why.My experience and observations lead me to believe that parts of the “New Age”scene are among the most easy to manipulate. It is the naïvety which makes itso. I have heard Bill Clinton described as a “lightworker” by some in the NewAge movement who have done no research whatsover into the background to the man.I hear all the instant, off-the-shelf responses about ‘cults’ from peopleinvolved in the very groups, organisations, and lifestyles which the word ‘cult’is being manipulated to target! Some of those who have done most to spread falsestories and gossip about me have been those who speak of truth and light. I usedto be amazed at that, but no more. One story doing the New Age rounds is that Ihave so much money I live as a tax exile in Jersey. As I’ve only been to Jerseyfor a total of four days in my life, I clearly don’t get home much! I read inspiritual magazines of the need for a world government as the expression ofOneness and the coming together of all peoples in One World. It sounds great,unless you do the research and see how the New Age Movement is being manipulatedtoo.I attended a lovely spiritual event at Wembley, London, in the summer of 1994.It was to celebrate the Oneness of all things and the need to express love inthe world, all of which I agree with. But manipulation of the human mind doesn’tonly come in one all-pervading blob. We have designer-manipulation which istargeted at a particular belief system. As people were leaving Wembley, therewas a group outside handing out little glossy leaflets carrying the message ofBabaji Francesco, “the man who has come to bring love and wisdom to all theEarth”. Mr Francesco, it turns out, is the founder of an organisation calledAssociazione S.U.M. – Stati Uniti del Mondo (the United States of the World). Onthe first page of the leaflet is a message about love from Mr Francesco in whichhe tells us that our tears are his tears and for those who follow him all painshall be removed. Excuse me, I feel quite ill suddenly. He says that he has cometo teach us that everything is One. Thank you very much. But wait, what else hashe come to teach us? That only by meeting the Earth’s problems at a worldwidelevel can they be overcome. This couldn’t mean, could it, that we need a worldgovernment, currency and army? Oh yes it could. His leaflet says:> “Babaji Francesco, in order to resolve all problems, proposes the unification> of the Nations of the Earth and maintains the need of a one and only World> Government composed of delegates of each nation. He deems important the> realisation of a one and only world army composed of volunteers of each> country, for the protection of all Peoples of the Earth, that they should be> effective and timely to avoid useless genocide like that which took place in> Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Somalia, etc…He also affirms that, in order to cancel the> public debt of each country, all states should cancel all debts between each> other and that it is necessary to eliminate all present currencies and replace> them with a one and only world currency that should have equal value in each> nation so that speculations, competitions, and wars would be replaced by> unity, brotherhood and peace among all human beings.”All of which is straight from the pages of the Global Elite game plan and theIlluminati Protocols. Either the man who has come to teach us and lead us intothis utopia needs to do some urgent research into the New World Order or he hasother reasons for equating the need for love and Oneness with a centralisedglobal tyranny. The Raëlian Foundation I spoke of earlier is also promoting allthe Elite’s ambitions because of what their ‘messiah’, Claude Raël, claims hewas told by the extraterrestrial “Elohim”. When I attended a New Age typeexhibition in the north of England, it was fascinating to see how manyorganisations I came across either supporting the United Nations and theconcepts of world government and/or offering people another excuse to give theirminds away to some “Supreme Master” or other. Don’t be thought-controlled by areligion – be thought controlled by a guru instead! I picked up a magazinecalled Share International, the publication edited by the Scottish-born painterand ‘esotericist’ Benjamin Creme who, the publicity says, has been “trained andsupervised over many years by his own Master”. The magazine, which claims tocirculate within 70 countries, is based in the Netherlands and the UnitedKingdom with branches and connections in many other countries, including theUnited States. The magazine promotes the “Maitreya”, the “World Teacher”, who,according to Creme, has “miraculously” appeared to people all over the planet.This “World Teacher” will only appear to everyone, he says, when the mediainvites him to. We have so far waited since 1977 for this while the “WorldTeacher” has, says Creme, continued to live in the Asian Community in Londonbetween his materialisations all over the world. When invited by the media,Maitreya will, says Creme, address an international press conference which willlead to the “Day of Declaration”, the time when the “World Teacher” will appearon radio and television networks worldwide and will mentally overshadow allpeople, simultaneously. All will hear his words through telepathiccommunication, apparently. Ummm, again. What’s going on here, I wonder? Costlyadvertisements appear constantly in the New Age magazines about “Maitreya”.Every advertisement features the “Maitreya” appearing “miraculously” tothousands of people in Nairobi in 1988, although I can’t say the picture looksanything like that to me. The exact locations of the Maitreya “manifestations”are never given. To do so would contravene the free will of the people involved,Creme tells us.The April 1995 edition of Share International which I bought at the exhibitionwas dominated by an interview with Sir Shridath Ramphal, the former SecretaryGeneral of the Commonwealth, calling for world government and the need for aleader of the calibre of Franklin D. Roosevelt! The interview is followed by areport on the Commission on Global Governance headed by Ramphal which includedcalls for, in effect, a world (UN) army, centralised global economic control,and a world government. This, in turn, was followed by three pages called“Priorities for a New World Order”. Benjamin Creme, in answers to letters, alsoinforms us that the only way to counter events like Bosnia and Rwanda is “tohave a United Nations with an army powerful enough, supported by all nations,who must give enough men and armaments”. Coincidentally, that is just what HenryKissinger says, and Babaji Francesco. Creme adds that if “Jimmy Carter liveslong enough, I believe he will become a member of a ‘group of wise men’ whichwill function as the future ruling committee of the United States”. TheTrilateral Commission will be delighted, I’m sure, and what’s this about a“ruling committee”? Whatever happened to democracy? Mind you, an article in themagazine tells us that:> “…a true disciple will apply himself to his ‘indicated task’ with all the> energy at his disposal, forgetful of his own personality, with the one purpose> of contributing all that lies within him towards serving and the realisation> of the Plan. This must inevitably also lead to his own progress – not towards> self-satisfaction, but by evoking dormant capacities that will mould him into> an ever more efficient instrument of service in the hands of the masters.” [my> emphasis]Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Here we go again. People follow, masters rule.“Maitreya” is one of the Alice Bailey ‘Masters’ and it is on her ‘teachings’that Creme’s organisation is based. At the same New Age exhibition I found twoother Alice Bailey-inspired organisations, the Lucis Trust, formerly theLucifer13 Trust, and its offshoot organisation, World Goodwill. The latter wasfounded by Alice Bailey in 1932 in the run up to the Second World War which ledto the creation of the United Nations. World Goodwill is now little more than aNew Age promoter of the United Nations from its centres in Whitehall Court,London, Geneva, and New York. Its many publications offer gushing praise for theUN as the answer to the ills of the planet. One leaflet is called “The GreatInvocation Cooperation with the United Nations”. It says:> “An inclusive attitude of mind and heart and active cooperative goodwill> between peoples and nations are necessary prerequisites to the establishment> of a new world order of peace and prosperity for all humanity…As a result of> mental conflict, separateness, and lack of understanding, a point of tension> has now been reached in world affairs; therefore a new opportunity of creative> progress exists for which the United Nations stands. …The United Nations is> today an instrument of universality and an agency for unity, peace and> prosperity in the world.”Give me strength. The World Goodwill arm of the Lucis Trust distributes articlesby UN staff and links the spiritual view of wholeness and oneness withcentralised global institutions. It publishes a quarterly newsletter which readslike a UN fan club. The one I picked up in the spring of 1995 included, likeBenjamin Creme’s Share International, an article about Sir Shridath Ramphal andhis Commission on Global Governance [a world government and world army are theonly way forward]. It also included a message from Global Elite frontman, DrBoutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary General, who tells us that: “…a newarray of problems of undeniable global dimensions are beyond the ability of anysingle country or group of states to solve”. We’d better have a world governmentthen, eh, Boutros? Other publications distributed by World Goodwill call for allpeople to be given identity cards, and one says that:> “The United Nations, through the General Assembly, specialised agencies, and> its various councils, commissions and committees must be supported; there is,> as yet, no other organisation to which man can hopefully look. Therefore, he> must support the United Nations, but, at the same time, let this group of> world leaders know what is needed.”It is worth subscribing to the World Goodwill newsletter, if only to see theextent of the infiltration of the Global Elite mentality into areas likespirituality and education. One UN education project alone, I read, involves anetwork of 3,200 schools in 122 countries. The UNESCO Associated Schools Projectis “dedicated to preparing children and young people to live in a global societyand to develop their attitudes of ‘Earth patriotism’ [See global village, globalneighbourhood, etc] that are vital in an increasingly interdependent world”.Children and young people are being indoctrinated to look to the United Nationsfor the answers and the Lucis Trust/World Goodwill organisation are supportingthis. As with most people helping the Global Conspiracy, 99% of them will haveno idea what they are really being used to promote. Most of the people whosupport these organisations will be doing so because they believe in what theysay. They have children and grandchildren and the last thing they want is toleave them a global fascist tyranny. But that is what they are, unknowingly,helping to create.I spoke to a guy at the Share International stall at the New Age exhibition andhe was a lovely man. He had no idea what he was involved with and answered everyquestion with “Well, as I understand it…” and “Well, it says in the magazine…”He’d given his mind away. At another stall I found another group of genuinepeople promoting The Brahma Kumaris, the World Spiritual University with morethan 3,000 teaching centres in 62 countries. This is a non-governmentalorganisation affiliated with the United Nations Department of Public Informationand winner of seven UN Peace Messenger Awards. It has consultative status withthe UN Economic and Social Council and UNICEF and has endless links with the UN.In 1988, it launched the first Peace Messenger initiative dedicated to the UN.Part of this was the publication of a book called Visions Of A Better World, inwhich international leaders and famous people from all walks of life made theircontributions. Again, at least 99% of those involved with the Brahma Kumariswill not realise what they are being used to promote by the One World Governmentbrigade. I also never cease to be amazed at the numbers of apparentlyopen-minded people who have, in truth, given their minds away to the man, sorrythe “living god on Earth”, called Sai Baba. These are people who dismissreligion as mind control and urge others to think for themselves!Designer manipulation of belief systems is very subtle, but extremely effectiveand the same centralised tyranny can be presented in many ways to suit themindset of different groups of people. We can expect a stream of guru-typefigures and ‘spiritual’ organisations being manipulated to do this or knowinglydoing so. If spiritual people and groups accept the one world government plan aspart of the journey to wholeness and oneness they will be supported by the UNand the manipulators. If they do not, they will be labelled a ‘cult’. That isthe manipulators’ dual approach to the re-emerging spirituality. We need toremember that nothing is ever what it seems at first glance. If we look ateverything from that perspective, we become so much harder to disinform. This isvital because there is one ‘cult’ that dominates all others on this planet. Itis the ‘cult’ which is devoted to, and pays homage to, a highly negativeconsciousness which is expressed as the worship of power and control.

And one which I trust will activate the determination withineach of us to regain control of our own destiny. This we can and will do, butthe bottom line is knowing that the manipulation exists, how it works, and towhat end. Without that knowledge, we are at the mercy of the manipulators,because a calculated long-term strategy will go on being presented as singularevents unconnected with each other. For those who still believe that the planfor a world government, central bank, currency, and army, together with amicrochipped population linked to a global computer, is a conspiracy ‘theory’, Iwill end this section with a summary of just how far along that road we havetravelled without realising it.World GovernmentThe United Nations is evolving rapidly into just such an institution. From itsearly days as a global talking-shop, it has created a massive network ofinterconnecting organisations which cover all areas of our lives, from health toaid to environment to a world police force to science to religion, and so itgoes on. The time is approaching when it will be given its own source offunding, independent of the nation states. Perhaps some funding ‘crisis’ will beengineered, with some major nations failing to keep up contributions and a‘solution’ will have to be found – a form of United Nations taxation of somekind or other. In 1993 Joseph Connor (CFR) was appointed undersecretary-generalfor administration and management at the UN. He was chairman of PriceWaterhouse, the Elite accountants, who have a designate on the Committee of 300.Mr Connor has been warning that the UN faces bankruptcy and something must bedone.1 Now there’s a surprise. More conflict will demand more ‘solutions’, andin desperation people will look to the United Nations for answers. Centralisedanswers. Most of the people who work for the United Nations believe they aredoing the right thing. They don’t know what they are involved in. They are pawnsin a game they don’t understand. The real agenda is hidden behind terms like“global village”, “global neighbourhood”, the “global commons” and the need for“One World”. The covert plan for the United Nations is exactly the same as thatunfolding in Europe. The pressure is being applied with ever greater severityfor centralisation of political power and decision making within theever-expanding European Union which is now a maze of centralised powerstructures and legislation affecting every facet of daily life. The face of thatorganisation has changed beyond measure in the last forty years. It has been ametamorphosis from trading area to centralised tyranny and the samestepping-stones process is happening within the United Nations. The President ofthe European Parliament, Klaus Hänsch, made his ambitions clear in The Europeannewspaper of May 1995, when he called for a European Union in which nationswould ‘pool’ their sovereignty for the greater good [centralised control]; aUnion which assumed its full responsibility for peace and security, acting inclose collaboration with the United Nations [world army]; a Europe which “livesup to the dreams and the vision of its founding fathers” [world government,central bank, currency, and army]. Popular enthusiasm for this “new Europeanproject” had to be generated, he said. I’ll give it a miss, if it’s all the samewith you, Klaus.One of the most vehement advocates of political and monetary union in Europe isthe German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. This is no surprise when, like hispredecessors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, he is a loyal member of theBilderberg Group. Kohl is alleged to be a Grand Orient Freemason and isconnected to B’nai B’rith which bestowed its highest honour, the Order ofJoseph, upon him.2 Kohl knows the game plan, alright, and works passionately forits success. Jacques Santer, the president of the European Commission, isanother Bilderberger running a tyrannical campaign for political and monetaryunion.This evolution to centralised control has been done gradually, quietly, andsecretly and only by looking back over the years can we see how much power thenation states, the regions, and communities, have given away. Decision makingthat affects our everyday existence has moved further and further away from thetowns, cities, villages, and countries in which we live. First to the nationalparliaments and civil service cartel, then to Europe, and, unless we stop beingpuppets on a string, eventually it will continue to move away still further tothe global government. The Trilateral Commission’s influence can be seen in thesupport by the European Commission for Japan to become a permanent member of theUnited Nations Security Council and to have a greater say in UN affairs.3 TheTrilateral Commission was created to coordinate the work of the manipulatingelites in the US, Europe, and Japan, as part of the move to world government.The game plan is coming closer to the surface with every month, as the GlobalElite begin to filter the prospect of a world government into the public domain.The former Secretary General of the Commonwealth, Sir Shridath Ramphal, voicedthe plan at an International Development Conference in Washington in January1995, when he said that the UN should be empowered to “raise global revenue forglobal purposes”. The conference supported the policy with great enthusiasm.Ramphal, the co-chairman of the Commission on Global Governance in Geneva,Switzerland, added that national sovereignty was outmoded. “The time has come toestablish arrangements of global governance,” he said. “We need a new order inworld affairs. Large numbers of people recognise this and understand by a ‘newworld order’ nothing less than the birth of a new world.”The attempt to achieve this coup on the human race will be done by making thepresent world so awful and chaotic that anyone promising a new world will befollowed like the Pied Piper, purely out of desperation (just like they did withHitler – the ‘saviour’ for Germany’s post-war misery). I believe the Elite havea global computer into which all the data of world events and public reaction isconstantly fed. The computer is programmed to process this data and produce alist of events projecting years ahead, which need to happen if the human mind isto accept world government. This way the Elite plan can be prepared far inadvance. Ramphal is a long-time standard-bearer for world government. He hasalso served on other global commissions like the Brandt Commission and theBrundtland Commission on Environment and Development. It was members of theseGlobal Elite-created commissions, and another led by the murdered Bilderberger,Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, who formed the Commission on GlobalGovernance in 1992, chaired by Ramphal and another prime minister of Sweden,Ingvar Carlsson. And who, pray, is this I see listed on the Commission on WorldGovernance? Why it’s…Maurice Strong (Comm 300), the ‘Green’ oil millionaire, theMaurice Strong who fronted the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil, and sits on theboard of the Aspen Institute owned by elite Bilderberger, Robert O. Anderson ofAtlantic Richfield Oil. Also listed is Jacques Delors, that archcentraliser andformer top man in the European Union. Commission on Global Governance = NewWorld Order. Another world government lobby event, the Global Forum on the First‘Global Civilisation’, was arranged by the Gorbachev Foundation USA, for theautumn of 1995. Gorbachev played his part magnificently in triggering theprearranged ‘freedom’ in the Soviet Union and its subordinate states to set thescene for the absorption of those countries into the European Union and theUnited States of the World. The ‘Cold War’ was also a case of thesis vantithesis = synthesis. The ‘freeing’ of the Soviet Union was planned, notspontaneous. Among those invited to the event in San Francisco, the officialbirthplace of the UN, were George Shultz (TC, CFR, Bil, Comm 300, KissingerAssociates), George Bush (TC, CFR, Comm 300), Margaret Thatcher (Bil), Al Gore(CFR), Zbigniew Brzezinski (TC, CFR, Bil), Paul Volcker (TC, CFR, Bil), and TedTurner (Comm 300), head of the CNN global news channel which has merged into theTime Warner empire. The pre-event literature published by the GorbachevFoundation said the forum would challenge political leaders to provide aframework for stability and regulated human interactions [my emphasis]. TheFoundation added that the forum was designed to:> “…focus on the fundamental challenges and opportunities confronting humanity> as we enter the next century and a new millennium. It is being held in the> belief that at this momentous juncture in history, we are giving birth to the> first global civilisation.”In other words, world government and all the trimmings. Expect to see a seriesof ‘commissions’, ‘conferences’ and ‘summits’ to discuss the creation of worldgovernment in the months and years ahead. Expect, also, an attempt to rewritethe US Constitution to allow the New World Order to impose its policies on theUSA. Another group to watch is the Bilderberg-related, New Atlantic Initiative(NAI), headed by the same crowd with Margaret Thatcher as a patron. It seeks tofuse the US with the European Union and make NATO a world army.World Central Bank and CurrencyRamphal also calls for the establishment of an “apex” economic body within theUnited Nations, an Economic Security Council. This fits in with the GlobalElite’s plan to fuse all economic power under one roof, or within one computer.The United Nations and its economic arms, the World Bank, the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD), and their stream of interconnected offshoots, control the world’seconomic development, along with other Elite groupings like the Bank ofInternational Settlements and the International Banking Commission. They decidewho has development funds, what they are spent on, and the economic changes thatmust happen within nation states before any money changes hands. It is a worldeconomic dictatorship run at the behest of the few. Within this network, too, isthe World Trade Organisation and the GATT ‘free trade’ agreement, which isgathering ever more power to prevent nation states from protecting their homeindustries and production from unwanted imports. Many of these imports come fromareas of the world where the native population is exploited in the most inhumanway.With countries increasingly unable to protect their own population from thiseconomic warfare, the people of the world become ever more dependent on a worldeconomic system over which they have no control. As cross-border tariffs onimported goods are removed by GATT, so that loss of revenue is being met by thepeople of those countries. They are subsidising the New World Order. A report bythe US Treasury in June 1994 suggested that GATT will reduce tariffs by nearly$750 billion over the following decade. Along with the pressure forcentralisation of political power in Europe has come the connected demand for aEuropean Central Bank and a single European currency. For political power to beeffective, it has to be backed up by economic power. If you control the currencyand the central bank to which all other banks are subordinate, you control thewhole of Europe. This will eventually encompass the states of the former SovietUnion, also. If we allow this to happen, the centralised European tyranny willhave been achieved by a mental coup d’état, without a gun being fired. TheAmerican continent’s version of this, the North American Free Trade Area(NAFTA), and the Asia-Australia version (APEC), are designed to evolve inprecisely the same way, until all connect with the United Nations as a worldgovernment, central bank, and currency. The plan is for NAFTA to become theAmerican Union, APEC to become the Pacific Union, and together with the alreadyestablished European Union, they would come under the control of a globalgovernment. At a 1995 meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Denmark, insidesources suggest that the plan was revealed for a Transatlantic Free Trade Area(TAFTA) to combine the European Union with the North American Free Trade Area.Sir Leon “Mr GATT” Brittan, the European Trade Commissioner, has since calledfor something similar and the British Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind (Bil),did the same at the 1995 Conservative Party Conference. Ireland’s PeterSutherland (Bil, TC), the GATT negotiator and first Director-General of theWorld Trade Organisation, was at the Trilateral meeting to speak about the“changing world economy”. At the same time the German Foreign Minister, KlausKinkel, was in Chicago addressing the Council on Foreign Relations about theTransatlantic Free Trade Area. Bill Clinton and the European Union have formerlyagreed on “joint action” on many issues including trade. Anyone who challengesthe Elite plan for Europe is immediately jumped upon. Bernard Connolly, theBritish economist working for the European Commission on the single currencyplan, was suspended by Jacques Santer (Bil) for writing a book exposing thescam. Neil Kinnock, a European Commissioner and former UK Labour leader, waspublicly censured by Santer for merely questioning that the timetable for asingle currency might be too tight, at a private meeting. The European Union isalready a centralised dictatorship. They are spending £40 million of our moneyon a publicity campaign to condition people to accept their policy of a singlecurrency, the “Euro” as it is to be called.4Remember the motivation and the methods. If you want to install a singlecurrency and bank, you have to create a perceived need for them. Therefore youtrigger a banking crisis and currency chaos. On the face of it, when such thingshappen and they are reported on the news, they appear to be bad for the bankersand financiers, and for many they are. But not for the Global Elite, becausethey need such crises to manipulate their plan into reality and, as they knowwhat is coming, they not only can insulate their own resources from the effectof their actions, they can actually make an economic killing. George Soros(Bil), the Hungarian with a US passport, is one of the most famous currencyspeculators. He ‘gambles’ billions of dollars to destabilise currencies andmarkets, making unimaginable fortunes in the process. Soros, a former student atthe London School of Economics, moved to the US to establish his vehicle for“speculation”, the Quantum Group, which is dominated by Swiss and Italianfinanciers. Funnily enough Switzerland and Italy are also the base of the BlackNobility. Researcher, William Engahl, names Soros as a frontman for theAnglo-French Rothschild banking group.5 One of the board members of the “Soros”Quantum Fund is Richard Katz, the head of Rothschild Italia S.p.A. in Milan anda board member of N.M. Rothschild.6 Another Quantum director is Nils O. Taube, apartner with Lord Rothschild of St James’ Place Capital.7 An associate of Sorosin several speculations has been Sir James Goldsmith,8 a Rothschild relative whonow claims to “oppose” centralisation of power in Europe. It was Soros whofronted the attack on the pound that led to the British Chancellor, NormanLamont (Bil), withdrawing the UK from the European monetary system, the ERM, soincreasing calls for one European currency. Lamont is an employee of theRothschilds, and Soros is a frontman for them. Currency ‘speculations’ areneither speculations nor accidental. They are carefully planned and executed toensure a specific effect.In late 1994 and early ’95, the Elite plunged Mexico into economic chaos whichseriously affected the value of the dollar, just as they did before when Mexicowanted to use its oil potential to gain economic independence from the USA. Indoing so, those US banks who knew the peso’s collapse was coming, made afortune. While the Mexican people suffered from the consequences, Citibankreported an 81% increase in earnings for the last quarter of 1994 and the NewYork daily, Newsday, reported profit gains for Chemical Bank of 22% and theRockefeller/Rothschild Chase Manhattan of 19% for the same period. All wereheavy investors in the peso, but switched their investments at exactly the righttime to take advantage of its imminent fall.Mexico is being pushed into an economic catastrophe through debt to the banks ofthe Global Elite because they want to forgive the debt, or some of it, in returnfor control of all of Mexico’s oil and other natural resources. Who proposed the$40 billion bail out of Mexico which has substantially increased its debts toAmerica, so accelerating the scam? The Democrat, Bill Clinton. Who supportedhim? The Republicans, Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. In June 1995, the leaders ofthe 67 industrialised countries met in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a week after theBilderberg meeting in Switzerland, and agreed to increase the role and powers ofthe IMF. Their excuse for this? The financial collapse of the Mexican peso! BillClinton also called for a national identity card in the United States to dealwith the “wave of illegal immigration [from Mexico] that was sure to follow”.Meantime small business people the world over are being ruined by a marketrigged in favour of the multinational banks and corporations which control thepoliticians who pass the legislation.World ArmyThe progress to a world army has advanced quickly through the 1980s and ’90s.The idea is to manipulate conflicts which will lead to demands for greatermilitary powers for the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces. They will then befused with NATO into a world army. What would a world army do? Invade anycountry or community that refuses to bow to the world government, central bank,and currency. The Gulf War in 1991 was created in part to hasten this processwith NATO countries funding and fighting that conflict under the United Nationsflag. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia has been manipulated to this sameend. As a result of the horrors of Bosnia, we now have a 60,000-strong, 30nation world army assembled in the former Yugoslavia working under centralisedcontrol, the biggest multinational force to be seen since the second World War.Exactly to the Elite plan. Any occasion which sees NATO forces operating outsidetheir designated area is another precedent which takes us closer to the worldarmy. We can expect to see moves, too, which extend NATO’s area of operation,particularly into the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, and you will seemoves to expand the number of nations in NATO in the same way that the EuropeanUnion is expanding. The UN troops will continue to evolve from peacekeepers topeace enforcers and then, once that precedent is set, to enforcers of policiesissued by the global political and economic elite. When the UN troops are seento be ineffective in places like Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and Somalia, thepublic perceive this as a bad thing. But for the manipulators, this failure isessential. If the UN Peacekeeping operations were working effectively, therewould be no demand to give them more powers. They have to be seen to be notworking (problem) to attract the desired reaction (something must be done), andopen the way to the greater powers (the solution). The immediate victims of thisare the men, women and children, slaughtered by the Elite-engineered civil warsdesigned to show that the UN forces need more power. We can expect more Rwandasand Bosnias until public opinion either bows to the manipulation for a worldarmy or acts to bring an end to the New World Order. The former UNSecretary-General, the Elite-stooge, Dr Boutros Ghali, was echoing the words ofHenry Kissinger at the 1991 meeting of the Bilderberg Group when he called forthe formation of a UN Army under its own command with the right to go into anation state at will and without the need to consult other countries forpermission. In his Washington speech, Sir Shridath Ramphal said that the UNshould be “backed by the ability to rapidly deploy UN forces,” and he said thatprotecting the security of states was clearly authorised under the UN charter.The following day, Jessica Mathews, a senior fellow of the Council on ForeignRelations, called for exactly the same, a UN Standing Army, when writing in theElite-controlled, Washington Post.Readers of The Spotlight newspaper have been sending in pictures of UN troops inthe United States on manoeuvres all across the country and UN tanks andequipment being transported by rail trucks. The authorities have denied theexistence of any such thing. As I detail at some length in The Robots’Rebellion, government organisations like the Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) are fronts for the creation of holding areas (concentration camps) forthose who oppose the New World Order conspiracy once it has launched itsphysical coup d’état across the world, particularly in America and Europe,against those who challenge the tyranny. Indeed in some areas this has alreadybegun. FEMA was created under an Executive Order (which required no debate inCongress), and signed by President Jimmy Carter, the Trilateral Commissionfrontman. This allows FEMA to take control of the United States during any“national emergency” declared by a president. These powers include martial lawand the right of the military to enforce whatever FEMA decides. All the laws arealready in force which allow a military take-over of the United States. Theyhave been passed by Presidential Executive Order and any time a president callsa state of emergency they can be invoked. At the forefront of this plan are theDelta Forces in their black uniforms and unmarked black helicopters. These haveoften been seen at the scene of cattle mutilations, which some researchersconnect with extraterrestrial activity. People can ignore all this and walk awayif they like, but their children will reap the consequences if we hand over ourresponsibility for much longer.The Spotlight edition of December 5th 1994, revealed the creation of a jointUN-NATO force called the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) which will have four“multinational” divisions of some 80,000 troops when combat ready. According tothe article, the designated commander-in-chief is Sir Jeremy MacKenzie, aLieutenant General in the British Army. The justification of this force was thefailure of the UN and NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia! A report quotedby Spotlight from the North Atlantic Assembly, an offshoot of NATO, says thatthe multinational interventions in the Balkans have been “characterised bymassive failure and shortcomings” (problem). To cope with this new challenge,the report continued, NATO required a new organisation (solution). The jointNATO-UN Allied Rapid Reaction Corps had already completed its first exercisesunder UN auspices by the time of the Spotlight article, a NATO report obtainedby the paper confirmed. Some 2,000 troops were involved in a rapid deployment ofriot control forces from northwestern Germany to “…an imaginary crisis spot inthe United Kingdom”. The veteran military analyst Lieutenant Colonel MatthewCoulterm, said when told of this:> “Troops that practise multinational military intervention in the internal> domestic quarrels of Great Britain today will be preparing to do the same> thing in the US tomorrow. We must cut off the head of this one-world monster> before it bites us.” 9Ironically when the Bosnian hostage crisis unfolded in May 1995, somepoliticians called for a UN-NATO rapid reaction force. It already existed! Theprocess of centralising the world military is also happening with the policeforces. A little debated or publicised clause in the Maastricht treaty forEuropean Union established the K4 Committee to create a European police networkoperating outside democratic control. This must have been one of the clauses thevoting fodder politicians missed when they failed to read the treaty beforepassing it into law. K4 is supposed to coordinate pan-European police actionagainst drug trafficking, money laundering, and illegal immigration. It willalso establish a European police network called Europol and a massive databaseof information about the population. Some have described it as a European FBI.Under the Maastricht Treaty, the ‘democratically’ elected European Parliamentwill have the right to be ‘consulted’ about the policies of K4, but has no rightto change or veto them! The membership of K4 is also to be kept secret andinaccessible to journalists and human rights groups. Tony Bunyan, a director ofthe civil liberties group, Statewatch, said that K4 is “a major step forward inthe creation of the European state infrastructure that will be largelyunaccountable and undemocratic”. The British government and establishment whichtalks from time to time of its concern about the centralisation of power inEurope is a keen supporter of K4. This is because the rhetoric of those in poweris only for public consumption. The overwhelming majority of them support thecentralisation of Europe, whatever they may claim.The Microchipped PopulationThis is the part of the Elite strategy which some people find hardest to accept.We believe that we would never allow it to happen. Well, let’s take a look athow close it is. Already domestic animals are being microchipped in ever greaternumbers and linked to a computer. It’s been sold to pet owners on the basis of:“You’ll never lose Rover or Fido again”. The Queen of England has had some ofher corgis microchipped. Who next, Prince Charles? Alongside this, the move tophase out the use of coins and notes is being quickened and all moneytransactions will be electronic via a credit card and/or smart card. This isplanned to become a joint identity/money card with all personal details on amicrochip. If things go to plan, all these transactions will be recorded by aglobal computer – the “beast”, possibly, mentioned in the Biblical Revelations.The “mark of the beast,” the microchip, is planned to be moved from the smartcard to the human body when a story can be hatched to persuade people to acceptit. Some researchers suggest that the human barcoding system will include threesets of six digits in the computer – hence 666, “the number of the Beast”. Oncewe have agreed to the end of cash and there is no turning back, we will have toaccept the microchip implant or we will have no means of purchasing anythingwhen they decide to phase out smart cards. Also it will be sold to people as aconvenience which will end credit card fraud and lost cards. It is the ultimatecontrol. Everything about you, including your location, will be constantlyobserved by the computer. I am told by a very good source that the Global Elitecomputer system is based underground in Brussels, Belgium. It is called theKrypt or Crypt because it is located in 100,000 square feet of office spaceunderneath the Church of the Sacred Blood of Jesus, known locally as the BloodChurch. The main entrance to the underground facility is from buildings acrossthe road from the church. Similar computer centres are located at the Air ForceAcademy, Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado Springs, USA, and the Satellite ControlCentre, Alice Springs, Australia. These systems lock into government computersacross the world to gather information on everyone on the planet who has asocial security number or identification code of some kind. Your details will beon this computer now, waiting for the start of microchipping.Today if you go into a shop to buy food and your credit card is refused by thecomputer, you can pay with cash. What happens when there is no cash? You are atthe mercy of the computer. If it refuses your card or microchip, you have nomeans to purchase anything. We will then be robots in every sense, an extensionof a computer program. In the US, Food Stamps and some other benefits are beingconverted to the card based Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) and the wholesocial security system is planning to do the same. The plan to phase out cashmoves apace. A United Kingdom company, AIM UK, which specialises in “automaticidentification”, produced a face with a bar coding on the forehead as part ofits publicity material. One of this company’s products is Radio FrequencyIdentification which reads electronic labels in manufacturing, warehousing,shops, and on people. The technology now being developed will allow everythought and action to be monitored and recorded. The London Sunday Times ofApril 16th 1995, also reported that:> “The next computer you buy may be the last one you will need. In future,> scientists want to insert electronic chips into our heads so we can plug> directly into the information superhighway. British researchers are among> international teams working on an implant to translate human thought into> computer language. In a generation, one group says, people with a> peppercorn-sized chip in the back of the neck will be able to talk to> machines.”Or, rather, the machines will be able to talk to them. People with satellitetelevision are amazed to find that their individual decoder cards can beprogrammed from the TV headquarters. When you ring to subscribe to a ‘scrambled’channel, the operator activates a beam which programmes your card and thepicture appears while you are still on the phone! If they can do that to a card,they can do it to a microchip inside a human being. The Elite plan includes themicrochipping of all babies at birth. It would take only a fraction of a secondto do. The technology already exists and the only thing that remains is topersuade public opinion to accept it, or even demand it. One way this will bedone is to highlight missing children stories, including the abduction of babiesfrom maternity wards. While I have been writing this book, there have been suchincidents in the United Kingdom and immediately the ‘solution’ offered waselectronic tagging. This is a tiny step from an implanted microchip. Theelectronic tagging of criminals is also a stepping-stone to the microchip. Withthe mind control techniques I discussed in the last chapter, it is no problem toprogram a woman to go into a hospital and steal a baby to create thesomething-must-be-done scenario. She would have no recollection of herprogramming and she would believe it was her decision. A highly acclaimedelectronics engineer in the United States was developing a microchip implant tohelp spinal injury patients when, he said, the project was hijacked by theone-world brigade. The story of Dr Carl W. Sanders was reported in theinvestigative magazine, Nexus, in the summer of 1994. He said that he attended17 meetings of the One-Worlders in places like Brussels and Luxemburg. Themeetings, he claimed, were “tying together the finances of the world”. DrSanders said:> “I was at one meeting where it was discussed: ‘How can you control a people if> you can’t identify them?’ People like Henry Kissinger and CIA folk attended> these meetings. It was discussed: ‘How do you make people aware of the need> for something like this chip?’ All of a sudden the idea came: ‘Let’s make them> aware of lost children, etc.’> “This was discussed in meetings almost like people were cattle. The CIA came> up with the idea of putting pictures of lost children on milk cartons. Since> the chip is now accepted, you don’t see the pictures anymore, do you? It’s> served its purpose.” 10Dr Sanders said the manipulators want the chip to contain a name and a pictureof the person’s face, an international Social Security number, fingerprintidentification, physical description, family and medical history, address,occupation, income tax information, and criminal record. Another selling pointof this, no doubt, would be the end of passports. The chip recharges itself byturning the changes in body temperature into a dynamo system and the mosteffective places they have found for this are the forehead and the back of thewrist. The BBC ‘science’ programme, Tomorrow’s World, revealed in September1995, how in the UK, people are already being microchipped with their medicalrecords. This stuff is happening NOW! The implications of allowing ourselves tobe microchipped are far wider than I’ve even outlined. It also involves thesuppression of the spiritual transformation now underway. The Sanders chip, hesaid, can be used to modify behaviour. During the Vietnam War, he told Nexus,they had a “Rambo Chip” which stimulated a greater flow of adrenaline. TimothyMcVeigh, the man charged with the Oklahoma bombing, says he was microchippedwhile serving in the US Army. How many mind-controlled service and ex-servicepersonnel are out there with microchips within them that can be activated atwill? Dr Sanders pointed out that if you stop the output of the pituitary gland,you can stop the flow of oestrogen, cause instant menopause, and stopconception. The chip can be a form of mass birth control, another theme of theNew World Order. Messages from the computer to the implanted chip can changemass behaviour, act as an emotional upper and downer, a sexual stimulant anddepressant, and trigger violence at will. And the major stepping-stones to themicrochipped human being are the microchipped identity card and the end of cash.Don’t let it happen.Supermarkets are now experimenting with barcoded cards which customers will useto keep a tally of their purchases and then pay for them when they leave,without the need for a checkout assistant. The big supermarket chains alreadyhave the facility for customers to pay by credit card in ways very similar tothis. The next step is to say how much more convenient it would be if customershad a little microchip under the skin without the need to use a card. Give yourfreedom away. You know it makes sense. Look at the supermarket queues you willavoid! In February 1995, the now defunct London Today newspaper included acentre page article predicting that cash would be phased out by the end of thisdecade and replaced with electronic money. ‘Trials’ are underway in England, asthey are across the world. The new European currency will almost certainly beelectronic.As I write this, there has been a story on the news that the new Europeancurrency will be delayed until the next century because of the time it will taketo print all the money and mint the coins. I can hear the punch line now: “Oh wehave found a way of speeding up the process – we’ll have an electroniccurrency!” The British government has made the UK the first country to introducecompulsory DNA profiles of everyone charged with a criminal offence. The DNAmakeup of a human being is a potentially catastrophic tool in the wrong handsbecause the underground science knows far more about these things than thepublic are told or even mainstream science knows. In the light of all theseprovable developments, it focuses the mind to reflect on the predictions in theBiblical Revelation:> “And he [the beast or antichrist] causes all, both small and great, rich and> poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their> foreheads, and that no-one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the> name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has> understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man:> His number is 666.”> Revelation 13:16–18The Hopi native American people also have an ancient prophecy that no-one willbe able to buy or sell without the mark of the bear. When this mark becomesvisible, the prophecy says, the third Great War will come. If you look at themark a bear makes when it sharpens its claws on a tree, there is a remarkableresemblance to the bar code of today. The New World Order is pushing ahead atthis time faster than ever before to secure food control, energy control,business and credit control and the sum total of all these things and more:people control. That’s what the manipulators mean when they speak of One Worldand the Global Village. A global fascist tyranny. A global plantation. The plannow is to divide and destabilise societies with terrorism and economic upheavalto dupe their collective minds into allowing what is left of basic freedoms tobe destroyed. Japan is one obvious target of destabilisation, but all are intheir sights unless we get wise to it. The idea is to stimulate fear in everyheart. Nothing is too unspeakable to the Global Elite in pursuit of this. We canstop all of it and we will stop it, but only when people choose to stop beingpawns and victims. The Global Elite are not all powerful. They exist and controlonly because the human mind has opted out of responsibility and allowed them torun the world. With everyone who regains control of their own mind, the task ofthe Elite gets harder and harder.If people are shocked by what they have read here, then I’m glad. I saw a badge,made in America, which said: “The Truth will set you free – but first it willpiss you off!” Reality often does shock and it’s time for human beings to lookreality in the face – and change it to a better one. The reality which has beenexposed here is the reality the collective human mind has created. It’s time togrow up. Human apathy and naïvety are the greatest weapons of the Elite. Openingourselves spiritually and realising the full glory of Creation is wonderful. Butif people float around in some spiritual mist, their feet dangling from theceiling, they are copping out, in my view, and the complacency I see in so manyareas of the spiritual movement is staggering in the light of events in theworld.I hear people who think that addressing or talking about something that is‘negative’ must be avoided at all costs. It is disempowering, I hear. Knowledgeis never disempowering. But ignoring it is. What is more negative anddisempowering than being manipulated every day towards a global fascistdictatorship while having no idea that it is even happening? What is morenegative than having thoughts planted into our minds which we believe to be ourown? And what does negative energy do, if it is not addressed? It staysnegative, or gets more so. Is that what the spiritual movement wants? Is thatempowering? Or is it much easier to live in some semi-dream world where wordslike love and peace are scattered around like confetti while the Elite go onunchallenged because to expose their manipulation is considered too ‘negative’?It is easy to speak words, much harder to live them. And if we are going tochange this world for the better, then words like love, peace, respect, andfreedom need to be lived and not just parroted like some New Age speaking clock.As its foundation, any guide to freedom needs a thorough knowledge of why andhow that freedom has been removed in the first place. Without that, there can beno answers. But answers there are if we have the courage and the vision to stopplaying around and get on with it.People of Planet Earth.

That thought is our freedom. If we aregoing to remove the global dictatorship – and we are are – it will be done bychanging the way we think and feel about ourselves. Who are the real PrisonWarders who have systematically delinked us from our true and infinitepotential?We are.You, me, all of us. I outlined some ideas in The Robots’ Rebellion for the waywe can organise and evolve our societies to ensure the freedom of thought andexpression we seek. But they were only ideas, not rigid structures. Society, andhow it is organised, reflects, like everything, human thought. If we feel fear,guilt, resentment, and hatred, and we desire for others to take over ourresponsibility, those thought patterns will create the dictatorship institutionsof today. However, if we feel love, respect and forgiveness, for self andothers, and we desire to retake control of our minds and responsibility, thensociety will express those thoughts. The answer to the ills I have described inthis book is within us and how we think and feel about ourselves. Everythingthat happens in this physical world is the result of a thought or thoughts. Ifwe change thought, we change the physical world. In this closing section of thebook, I am going to address this process because it is the means through whichwe can, and will, create a better world. The inner revolution becomes the outerrevolution. The Earth is a mirror of the human mind.It is appropriate at this stage to recap on a major theme of the book: creatingour own reality. Look at your world and your life and you are looking at whatyou think of yourself at the very core of your being. It is easier to lookoutside ourselves for someone else to blame for what is happening to us. But weattracted those experiences and so the answer lies within, not without. We areabsorbing magnetic energy from the cosmos and higher levels of ourselves andbroadcasting that energy out through the chakra/vortex system into the world,all the time. As that energy passes through us, it picks up our energy pattern.This precisely reflects our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual state ofbeing. Through this means, the subconscious creates a physical replica of itselfbefore our eyes, in people, places and experiences which reflect its sense ofself. At any moment in any day, we are casting around us a magnetic image ofwhat we think of ourselves. It is this which creates our reality by magneticallyattracting to us experiences which correspond with that pattern. If you thinkyou will always be poor, that is the magnetic energy pattern you will castaround you. This will attract poverty to you on the basis of like attracts like.Look at yourself and most of the people you know. Observe for a while how manynegative statements you and they make about the world and themselves. “I can’tdo this”, “I could never do that.” The common theme is: “I’m not good enough”.As a result, we achieve little because that is what we expect to achieve.This is understandable to an extent, because thanks to religion and theeducation/media system, we are deluged with messages telling us we are ‘sinners’or ‘unworthy’ in some way. If you are a woman without a ‘perfect’ body, you areunworthy; if you are a little man with a bald head, you are unworthy; if youwork in a factory, you are unworthy compared with the guy in the suit; if youwere born out of wedlock, you are unworthy compared with those with ‘official’parents. There is a never-ending list of images which, if we do not conform tosome or all of them, we are considered, and consider ourselves, a failure orless worthy than someone else. All this is crap, but it is persuasive crap ifpeople are told it often enough from childhood. This is, in fact, the mostpowerful and effective of the mind manipulations I have been exposing. If we canbe made to feel unworthy, of little consequence, and only here to do as we aretold by our ‘betters’, then that is the magnetic energy field we broadcast andthat is the physical reality we create. In doing so, we are handing our mindsand our world to those who broadcast a reality in which they have the right tocontrol everything and everyone.Years ago, as a journalist, I visited a hostel for women who had been attackedby their husbands or partners. I was amazed to find that a number of these womenwere on their second, third or even fourth partner who had been physicallyviolent towards them. I am not amazed anymore, because I can see why this wasso. The women were attracting that punishment to them by what they thought ofthemselves. I did not meet one woman in that hostel who had any self-esteem andwhen I chatted with them, that lack of self-esteem clearly went back long beforethe first man attacked them. This is not to dismiss what they suffered, nor toexcuse what the men did to them. The men were also reflecting what they thoughtof themselves, because anyone who exhibits hatred and violence towards others isprojecting outwardly a hatred of self. The victims are only mirrors for what themen think of themselves. The reason these two inner imbalances are attracted toeach other is because the woman (who has such low self-esteem that she has aninner belief that she deserves to be punished), attracts the man (who wishes topunish others to avoid looking within). This is done through the attraction oftwo magnetic ‘capes’. When one violent relationship breaks down, the womansimply attracts another until the cause (the lack of self-love) is removed. It’sthe same with the man. Love at first sight, dislike at first sight…all suchreactions are the result of this process.The family connection is important to emphasise here. Apart from the relativefew who eventually break away from the mental and emotional domination of theirparents, most people are massively influenced by the messages of childhood.Everyone is, to some extent, and these messages can be positive or, far toooften, negative. Our overwhelming source of information in the first few crucialyears of our physical lives is our parents. And what they tell us about theworld is a reflection of what they think of themselves. They were the productsof their own upbringing and what their parents thought of themselves. If ourparents and grandparents were given negative images of themselves and theirpotential, they are likely to have passed this onto us. This is not done out ofmalice, merely misunderstanding. Our parents are the products of theirupbringing, just as we are of ours. Each generation of victims creates, largelyunknowingly, the next generation of victims. But we don’t have to. The cycle canbe broken and that is what we are here to do. We are here to take the baton ofconditioning and limitation from our parents, break those patterns, and hand abaton of freedom onto our children.As the mind control and the human divisions of class, job, sex, colour andcreed, have grown, the childhood messages for the majority have been extremelynegative. If you are a woman, you are led to believe that you are here to servemen and conform to your place in a man’s world. A career of your own? What aboutyour husband? In these circumstances, standing in a man’s shadow becomes thewoman’s reality and that is the life she attracts and therefore creates. If weare born into a vast council housing estate amid poverty and unemployment, it iseasy to see how through childhood and into adulthood we can be persuaded thatlife will always be like that. We can believe that there is no way out of thiscycle. It becomes our reality. We don’t expect to escape from our lot in lifeand so we don’t, because we are attracting to us what we expect. We don’t expectto have a say in what happens in the world and, again, that is what we create.It is the same with those who suffer from inhuman deprivation in parts ofAfrica, Asia, and Central and South America. Children born into those conditionsnaturally believe that this is what life must be like because they have knownnothing else. They inherit, and then pass on, the mindset that the West is richand they are poor and it will always be so. As a result they remain poor andexploited because that is the magnetic reality they attract. If you can createthe mindset, you create the physical reality, and this is what the manipulatorsseek to do.Now look at this from the Global Elite point of view. The children of the keyfamilies at the peak of the pyramid are brought up through childhood to believethat not only will they always be rich materially, they are also programmed tobelieve that they have a birthright and a genetic inheritance which ensures theywill control the world and deserve to do so. That is what they believe and thatbecomes their magnetic reality. This energy pattern which they broadcast aroundthem attracts the experiences and opportunities to manifest in their lives whatis going on inside. They do indeed control a world made up largely of peoplebroadcasting, and creating, the reality that they are unworthy and have nocontrol over their lives. One reality dominates the other and it is notdifficult to see why. Of course, the attitude of the Global Elite which saysthey are superior and have a right to control others is a reflection of deepimbalances within them, a lack of love and respect for self, manifestingoutwards as a lack of love and respect for others. This will make themunfulfilled and unhappy people, always seeking happiness and a sense offulfilment by yet more control and domination of others. But at the level ofcontrolling the world, their day by day reality is very much that they are thecontrollers. Therefore they are. And each generation within the families of theGlobal Elite will program that into their offspring, so maintaining the realitythrough the decades. Whatever else is going on inside, someone who believes theyare born to control will always dominate those who believe they are unworthy andneed to look to others to tell them what to think and do. The ‘master’ and the‘slave’ create each other.There will be those who claim that all this cannot be true because while theyare always saying they are confident of achieving this or winning that, theynever do. That’s because they don’t really believe it. Far from describing whatwe feel inside, words are often used to hide what is happening within us. Theyare fronts, smokescreens, to our true self. Words only have real power when webelieve what we say. This is why two people can make the same speech and onewill get a standing ovation and the other polite applause. If we truly feel thewords we speak, they project an energy of enormous power, for it is thecombination of the words and our inner self in unison. If another person justreads the words competently and professionally without feeling them with alltheir being, that potential power will not be there. I can say I am a blackwoman. I find it easy to say that. But I don’t believe it because I am not ablack woman, I am a white man. Words are just words unless we believe them. Itis not words that create our reality, it is what is going on inside of ourmultidimensional, magnetic, self.When people verbally attack politicians or those in power of any kind, theybelieve they are proving that they won’t be pushed around by authority. Oftenthe opposite is the case. People may attack politicians as “useless” or bankersas “greedy parasites”, but what happens when anything goes wrong? To whom dothose same people look for answers and responsibility? Themselves? No.Politicians and bankers. What are “they” going to do about it, they ask. Thewords are just a façade, an illusion that people are taking control of theirlives. The inner being is still giving its mind and life away to others and thatcontinues to be the physical reality, no matter what the words may say.The New World Order is the natural outcome of each generation handing over itsresponsibility and potential. The collective mind of the human race is the sumtotal of all human thought. Whatever dominates human thought will dominate thecollective mind and this also creates a global magnetic reality. If thedominating thought patterns in the collective mind include a desire for someoneelse to take responsibility for our lives and do all the things we can’t bebothered to do, then the magnetic pattern thus produced will create acollective, global, version of that – the network called the New World Order. Itwill attract together the imbalanced energy fields of the Global Elite to fulfilthat reality. The Global Elite are the collective equivalent of a dominatinghusband who tells his wife everything she must do and think. That woman willhave attracted that man and vice versa because of what is going on within bothof them. So it is with the collective mind and the New World Order. It is ourcreation.We are the Global manipulators because the people identified in this book arethe global reflection, the mirror, of the way we manipulate each other. Look athow we all manipulate people by using fear and guilt to get our own way. Weoften do it without realising it because it has become so much a part of thehuman psyche. The Global Elite are simply doing the same on a global scale. Lookat how people play two sides off against each other to bring about a desiredresult in a family or business. The Elite are only doing the same on a biggerstage. It is only the scale that is different. They represent the sum total ofhuman behaviour on that vibration of control and domination which billions ofpeople are using in their own lives day by day. So when we look at theRothschilds, the Henry Kissingers, and the David Rockefellers who are provablymanipulating the human race along a dark and deeply unpleasant road, in my view,they are only the reflection of what is happening in the collective human mind.When we love, respect, and forgive ourselves and each other, and when we desireto take responsibility for our own lives, that will be the reality we willcreate around us and, together, we will create globally. The New World Order ofcentralised dictatorship will not be able to exist in such circumstances becauseit will not be the collective desire and, therefore, the collective reality. Wewill have thought it out of existence. There is no such thing as a “naturalorder”. What we call the “natural order” is merely the physical expression ofthe dominating thought patterns in any society or on a particular frequency.When the thought patterns change, so does the “natural order”.There are many thought patterns that form together to create our inner sense ofself and our outer physical reality. It’s not only the way we think now. Itincludes all the thought patterns, the inner resentments, hurts, fears, andguilts, we have held on to from earlier in our lives and in previous physicallives, sometimes going back aeons. If your life today does not reflect the wayyou are consciously thinking, it can be that way for a number of reasons. One isthat you are holding on to patterns from the past which you may not even beaware of. How can you tell what they are? Look at your life. It reflects what isgoing on inside. What is it about your attitude to yourself that is attractingyour present experience? It is only by our subconscious creating an outer,physical, reflection of itself that we can identify what we are carrying deepwithin our psyche. Many people, at this time of the Great Transformation of theEarth and the human race, are going through highly negative experiences, mostlyaffecting the emotional level where so much of this psychological baggage fromthe past is accumulated. Although it may not seem so at the time (as I know frommy own experiences), this process is actually very positive. It is giving us theopportunity to face our inner self and let go of the pain and weight of thepast. We don’t live in and enjoy the now because our ‘now’ is dominated by thebaggage of the past and the worry of the future.Two other forces that help to create our present experience by affecting ourinner pattern are our desire to serve the Earth and the human race, and,connected with that, the astrological vibrations we are feeling day by day. Whenwe come with a specific task to make a contribution to improving life on Earth,and there are countless millions, potentially billions, of such people on theplanet at this time, we carry preprogrammed patterns which will help us to dothe job. Sometimes such people will not be doing what they consciously want todo, but they will be following a pattern from their higher consciousness whichwill attract to them the experiences necessary to carry out their chosen task inthis incarnation. Astrological factors will be part of this, as they are for allpeople. The planets are like transmitters broadcasting a distinct vibration.Depending where they are on their orbits in relation to the Earth, differentplanetary vibrations, or combinations of them, are more powerful at differenttimes in their effect on this planet. A good astrologer identifies thesecombinations and outlines their likely effect. Things don’t have to happen inresponse to these astrological changes because we have freewill, but they aremore likely to happen.At birth we absorb the energy pattern in the atmosphere of our birthplace. Thiswill reflect the positions of the planets at that moment. So, as the planetscontinue to travel the heavens during our physical lifetime, we will be affectedby them in a rather different way from someone born at another time and placebecause our inner ‘birth pattern’ will be different. Again a good astrologer –and the ability varies enormously as with every other profession – will be ableto predict likely effects on people if they know their exact time of birth andwhere they were born. They will also be able to make a reasonable assessment ofwhat we have chosen to achieve in this life by assessing the energies weabsorbed at birth. When and where we are born is rarely random. The movement ofthe planets and changing Earth vibrations they trigger are affecting us everysecond, and I believe it will be shown as the transformation proceeds that ourDNA is synchronised with the planets.There are many factors which go into the make-up of our inner energy pattern andtherefore the physical reality it creates. But one thing above all will lead usto a positive, joyous, freedom more effectively than anything else. That is tolove, forgive, and respect ourselves. The first step to that is to deprogrammeour minds from the manipulated messages of the Global Elite and allow ourselvesto be, think, and feel, what we really are. The real us, not the robot version.Deprogramming the MindAn ever-increasing number of people are deprogramming themselves from a lifetimeof subtle and less than subtle mental dictatorship. The minute-by-minutemessages from the media, religion, and the ‘education’ system, together with theinherited ‘values’ we absorb without question, have been designed to create aconcrete prison of dogma in our consciousness. I refer to religion and the otherempires of manipulation as psychological fascism. It turns our mind into a rigidenemy, when it should be our flexible friend.Letting go of dogma is the key. It doesn’t matter what form your dogma may take;there will be an opposing dogma to challenge yours. As these are brought intoconflict, a divide-and-rule scenario follows. This is why religions andpolitical parties were created. To the Global Elite, and therefore the PrisonWarder consciousness, the so called ‘far Left’ is just as important as the ‘farRight’. The dogmatic Christians are just as important as the dogmatic Muslims orHindus. The unions are just as vital as the ‘bosses’. You need two to tango andtwo to fight. Creating extremes and playing them off against each other has beenone of the most effective weapons in the Prison Warder control of this physicalworld. Tyranny takes many forms, most of them not obvious. More than that, mostpeople who behave in dictatorial, authoritarian ways, don’t even realise theyare doing so. They are so sure that they are right, they don’t stop to observethat they are imposing their beliefs on someone else and using the banner of‘freedom’ to do it. Mental dictators don’t all look like Adolf Hitler or JosefStalin. They can also stand in picket lines, go on freedom marches, or sitaround a candle in Glastonbury.We desperately need the re-emergence of female energy on the planet, but not tothe extent that we replace one dogma with another. When it was suggested that Ibe interviewed on the BBC radio programme, Woman’s Hour, the programmeresearcher asked what a man could possibly tell women about female energy. Thislady opposed, quite rightly, male chauvinism, but then expressed femalechauvinism, another dogma which operates on exactly the same thought pattern asthe one she was opposing! Some homosexuals who, again rightly, demand an end totheir oppression and victimisation, campaign for their beliefs in ways thatoppress and victimise others, often other homosexuals. They will, collectively,stop attracting discrimination when they stop giving it out. A British MPdemanded that violent criminals be thrashed on live television after theNational Lottery draw. What effect would this have, did she say? Less violencein society! And in the United States, perhaps the sickest and most violentsociety in the world, the death penalty is being extended to more states. Why?To deter violence and murder. They are killing people with electric chairs andfiring squads because, presumably, they say life is sacred and anyone who takeslife should be murdered. The mental gymnastics required for this beggars belief.All these examples are the same thought patterns promoted as opposites. They aredogmas, prisons of the mind. What we believe is right for us we surely need tobelieve is also right for everyone. If we don’t, we are not serious aboutfreedom for all, only freedom for ourselves and our own dogma.The difference between dictatorship and freedom is allowing all information intothe public arena and respecting another’s right to make of it what feels good tothem. Disagreement and harmony are not contradictions if respect for anotherview is there. When I challenge people and organisations in this book, it is notbecause of what they believe. They can believe what they like, that is theirchoice. I challenge them because from my perspective they seek to impose thoseviews and to suppress others. They can believe to their hearts’ content that aworld government and a microchipped population is a great idea. It is when theyimpose those things on others that a challenge becomes legitimate and necessary.We need to keep in focus what we mean when we talk of freedom. If we don’t dothat, we might, unknowingly, be acting in ways that stop ourselves and othersbeing truly free. I will highlight here three groups who campaign for freedom invarious ways and it’s interesting to see how the old thinking and dogmas can bepromoted as the new. If we don’t see the difference, then we remain programmed,manipulated, and freedom will be beyond our grasp.The Robot RadicalsThis is the name I give to those locked into the thought pattern considered tobe on the ‘Left’ or ‘radical’ wings of the Elite-created Left/Right spectrum ofalleged political ‘opposites’. This thought pattern has its whole view of lifecontrolled by where it considers itself and others to be on that mythicalLeft/Right scale. You are either Left or Right. There is no ‘in-between’ to aRobot Radical, precisely as the manipulators intended. It all appears so simple.Left is good and Right is bad and you must be one or the other. It is a thoughtpattern which speaks of freedom, but actually believes in anything but. It isanother form of inflexible, mental dictatorship decked out as freedom – thefreedom to pursue and impose its own dogma. The Robot Radicals are amanipulator’s dream. Smash the Tories and all will be well. Summon therevolution of the people against the fascist state. That’s what they said inFrance during their revolution. That’s what they said in Russia during theirs.Millions were slaughtered in the name of ‘people power’ and one tyranny wasreplaced by another. Those on the Robot Radical vibration do not appreciate thatthe same force that controls their ‘opposition’ also controls them. They are thefoot soldiers and propagandists for the Elite and the overwhelming majority haveno idea that this is so. Any suggestion of a global clique manipulating Left andRight is such an attack on their simple good-guys-bad-guys/freedom-fascist viewthat they find it easier to ignore or condemn the messenger than to open theirminds to the evidence.The nature of this mindset was brought home to me when The Robots’ Rebellion waspublished in the UK in 1994. It contains a wealth of information about thebackground to the ills that the Robot Radicals say they oppose. I do not claimthat every last word and detail is accurate, because we are dealing with thehistory of a secret strategy, after all, but it makes (I and many, many, othersbelieve) a significant contribution to the debate. Was it accepted as such bythe Robot Radicals? Not quite. My use of extracts from the Protocols Of TheElders Of Zion was too much for political purity to take. It didn’t matter thatI had emphasised, as I do in this book, that this is not a plot by Jewishpeople; it didn’t matter that I renamed them the Illuminati Protocols for thespecific reason of getting away from their association with Jewish people; itdidn’t matter that these Protocols, which came to light in the late 1800s,contain details of the very plan of manipulation which has provably unfoldedthrough the twentieth century. It doesn’t matter because the Nazis used theProtocols against Jews after Hitler was given a copy by a man of Jewishextraction, Alfred Rosenberg, and so anyone else who mentions them must becondemned. How the Elite must laugh with glee. A Robot Radical refuses to beselective or discerning and divide the two issues of who was blamed for theProtocols from what they actually say. What they are missing is a flexibility ofmind and yet it could be theirs now, this second, if they summoned the courageto make that choice.For some years in the 1980s, I was a national speaker for the British GreenParty. I was attracted by their desire to protect the planet and their allegedsupport for freedom of information. When a Green Party group in Salford,Manchester, asked me to speak about my book at the Green Party nationalconference in the Autumn of 1994, I was banned by the party hierarchy for, ineffect, inciting racial hatred. The campaign was whipped up by two RobotRadicals called Derek Wall and David Black, the author of a charming littlearticle about me headed “Son of God or Son of the Devil?” They were supported byothers in the Green Party’s Robot Radical clique, like Penny Kemp. I have aletter from the conference organiser which says that of the members of thecommittee who issued the ban only two had read the book and both went into themeeting determined to say it was not racist. They ended up being persuaded tovote for a ban by those who had not read it! And the membership which is so‘anti-hierarchy’ allowed its own hierarchy to deny their right to hear me speak.There are many genuinely open-minded people in the Green Party groups around theUK, but at the collective level, it is just another strand in the Elite web ofmind control and self-deception. The sad thing is, they don’t realise it. I hadintended to use the opportunity at the conference to talk about the underlyingmanipulation which is creating the problems the Green Party was set up toaddress, and the way that pollution-free energy sources are being suppressedwhich supercede anything the Green Movement has been promoting. The membershipdid not get the opportunity to hear this, however. The hierarchy in this‘anti-hierarchy’ party had decided what they should and should not hear. Muchbetter to do that than to have a black-and-white belief system challenged. Ithas become another Robot Radical party, at the hierarchy level, which talks offreedom, but refuses to live it.You see this attitude constantly expressed in the various forms of RobotRadicalism, represented in the UK by newspapers like The Guardian, The NewStatesman, and The Socialist Worker. So it is with other ‘radical’ parties andorganisations who see freedom as having the right for their beliefs to take overthe centres of control from those they disagree with. One form of impositionreplacing another. And each new generation is enticed into the web and lockedinto this Robot Radical thought wave which not only makes life easy for themanipulating elite, it also imprisons the new recruits in abarely-one-dimensional view which shuts out their higher consciousness. It isjust another mental prison.It is a reflection of the thought patterns of the Global Elite. The Elitemanipulate minds by emphasising some information and suppressing or ignoring therest. So do the Robot Radicals. They claim to be anti-racist, but, in reality,they are only against non-politically-correct racism. If you claim to be againstracism, it must mean all racism, surely. To see any race as inferior is not onlydeeply unpleasant, it is downright silly from the view of life that I hold. Ourminds, our consciousness, incarnates into endless physical bodies and lifesituations, white, black, yellow, Jewish, Arab, all of them. To judge someone bytheir genetic spacesuit – body – is the ultimate misunderstanding, I feel. Butthe Robot Radicals posture their political purity (or knowingly work for themanipulators) by attacking as racists those who are legitimately investigatingthe global conspiracy, while they ignore completely the blatant examples ofJewish racism.The child-like mind of the Robot Radical cannot challenge Jewish racism becausethe Nazis they so despise are anti-Jewish, and so they must not say a wordagainst Jewish racism because they might be seen to be supporting the Nazis.Showing themselves to be against all racism is far less important to a RobotRadical than playing their silly political games on a black and whitechessboard. So while New World Order researchers are condemned as racistsbecause they name some people who happen to be Jewish (and far more who arenot), nothing is said by the Robot Radicals about the Talmud, the Jewish Book ofLaw, which is among the most appallingly racist documents on the planet. Thereis silence, too, about rabbis who say they would never drink wine that had notbeen bottled by a Jew. Yet there would be vehement condemnation of someone whosaid they would never drink wine that had been bottled by a Jew. The stench ofhypocrisy fills the air.In the same way, there is silence from the Robot Radicals when people like theFrenchman, Jean Briere, are fined or jailed for expressing an opinion. Briere, aformer spokesman for the French Green Party, was given a three-month suspendedprison sentence and fined £1,800 for “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli remarks”. Hehad said the Jewish lobby had influenced the US to start the Gulf War and hedescribed Israel as “racist, militaristic, theocratic, and expansionist”. TheRobot Radicals would have been united in their condemnation of Briere and yethad he spoken those words about America and Americans, those same Robot Radicalswould have burst into spontaneous applause.What is the difference between the anti-Jewish laws in Nazi Germany and lawsunder which you can be fined and imprisoned for saying what Briere said? What isthe difference between the controlled anti-Jewish media under Hitler and the waythe Japanese magazine, Marco Polo, was closed down by its parent company in 1995because of a campaign by the global Jewish hierarchy to stop its advertisingrevenue after it published an article questioning some of the official storiesof the Nazi concentration camps? Both come under the heading ofauthoritarianism, but don’t ask a Robot Radical to see that. Their dogma couldnot cope with it. These apparent ‘opposites’ like Right and Left, fascists andRobot Radicals, are actually operating on the same thought patterns. They justuse different words to describe the same thing: imposing their dogma on everyoneelse while seeking to deny a platform to views and information they disagreewith.When I spoke in Glastonbury, Somerset, in 1995, a Robot Radical from the localGreen Party handed out leaflets and went to the media condemning me and TheRobots’ Rebellion for spreading racial hatred. This campaigner for freedom, aDavid Taylor, wanted to ensure that I would not have the opportunity to speak inGlastonbury again, so denying the people the right to make up their own minds.He listed a series of staggering misrepresentations and untruths on his leafletin support of his case. This did not surprise me when I realised that Mr Taylor,despite his campaign and condemnation, had not actually read the book! I kid younot. When asked about the manipulation of the Freemasons, he replied that theywere an organisation that did a lot for charity, and when faced with theinformation about the way Roosevelt had provably manipulated America into analready manipulated Second World War, he said that unless the Americans had comeinto the war, Hitler would have won. Mr Taylor was speaking and acting for acollective mindset that grips the consciousness of hundreds of millions of RobotRadicals all over the world. No wonder the Global Elite have had such a freeride thus far.The Robot Radical mindset is a telling mixture of naïvety and arrogance and thatis one heck of a combination! How ironic that the people who have done most toattack me for trying to make suppressed information available are those whoclaim in their angelic, politically-correct, lily-white sense of their ownpurity, that they stand for freedom from tyranny. The Robot Radicals are atyranny and they are just too full of their own political perfection to realiseit. And on the other ‘extreme’ you have the Robot Right, the same tyrannicalthought pattern as the Robot Radicals, but wearing a different uniform. TheRobot Radicals are convinced of their moral purity and the Robot Right areconvinced of their genetic purity. But they are the same thought patterndisguised as opposites.Nothing has illustrated the arrogance and naïvety of the Robot Radical mindsetin my recent experience, more than two people called Matthew Kalman and JohnMurray. They publish a magazine in Britain called Open Eye. This is some ironybecause I have rarely come across eyes and minds that were more obviouslyslammed shut. They claim to be interested in exposing manipulation andcorruption and yet appear to take every opportunity to attack and underminethose who are successful in raising these issues in the main public arena. Itwas they who have led people to believe that I am a Nazi or Nazi sympathiser andanti-Jewish. They wrote two grubby articles, one of which was published in theRobot Radical weekly, The New Statesman, under the heading “New Age Nazism”. Thefact that I am neither ‘New Age’ or a ‘Nazi’ is brilliantly symbolic of thestandard of their research. Apparently, anyone who has an open mind abouthistory and the official line is, by definition, a potential Nazi to Kalman andMurray. They also admit contributing ‘information’ about me to The Guardian andfor an outrageous article by ‘journalist’, Mark Honigsbaum, in the LondonEvening Standard, entitled “The Dark Side of David Icke”. At no time beforethese articles were written did either Kalman or Murray even take the trouble totalk to me. Kalman is also editor of a Jewish ‘alternative’ magazine called NewMoon, the November 1995 front cover of which portrayed me as Adolf Hitler.Inside was a Kalman and Murray ‘review’ of this book in which they claimed I wassaying it is all a plot by Jewish people to take over the world. You’ve read thebook and you can see the opposite is true. So why are they saying this?Virtually every article attacking me in this way was written by Kalman andMurray or had the ‘information’ supplied by them. Either this duo are just beingincredibly immature and silly (a strong probability) or they have anotheragenda. In my view, whatever their motivation, they have revealed magnificentlyhow the best defence the Elite have against exposure is the Robot Radicalmentality.If people were in control of their own minds, the nonsense communicated byKalman and Murray would be of no consequence. Unfortunately the Robot Radicalmind can’t wait to give itself away. Most depressing was the number of peoplewho believed the laughable ‘research’ behind these articles. Some began to handout protest leaflets at my meetings. Many were from the Anti-Nazi League. Theleaflets were equally, often staggeringly, inaccurate. Most of the people doingit had not read my books or heard me speak. They were reacting to what they readin the media, almost all of which was inspired by our friends Kalman and Murray!Some invitations for me to speak were also withdrawn on the strength of the sameinformation. The manipulators must be laughing themselves to death. Othersbehind the efforts to dub me a Nazi are, I am told by a good source, connectedto the Raëlian Foundation of which I wrote earlier.[../Images/00014.jpg]Figure 16What the Robot Radicals can’t see, and don’t want to see, is that the GlobalElite fund Jewish groups and anti-Jewish groups; communist groups andanti-communist groups; the far Left and the far Right. The Elite have no need tobring these ‘opponents’ into conflict because they are so imbalanced withintheir being that they find each other like heat-seeking missiles and attempt todestroy each other without any help from anyone. Whenever a person stands up tomake suppressed information public, the Elite network uses both wings in thediscrediting campaign. It uses its Robot Right organisations to come out insupport of the writer or speaker and then activates its Robot Radicalorganisations to attack the person for being a tool of the far Right. That isprecisely what has been tried with me, and most of the people involved will notrealise how they are being manipulated.If you really want to discredit someone, you arrange for anti-Jewish oranti-whatever events such as the smashing of graves, assaults on people, even aterrorist bomb in the extreme. You then point the finger at your target personor group. You say they are either directly responsible or ‘incited’ the actionsby what they are writing and saying. Adolf Hitler used this very technique whenthe Nazis burned down the German Parliament building, the Reichstag, in 1933 andblamed it on the communists. This method has an added bonus for a manipulator –it creates fear in their own community or group, thus making them easier tocontrol. I am not saying that there are no genuine attacks on Jewish and othergroups by desperately unbalanced and misguided people, but to say that all ofthem are genuine is equally naïve. The combination of naïvety and arrogance willensure that most of the members of both ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ don’t realise thatthey are being used by the same force (Figure 16 on previous page). I wouldrecommend that both the Robot Radicals and the Robot Right repeat over and overthose words of John F. Kennedy. Whether he really meant them or not is by theby. The words themselves are brilliant:> “We seek a free flow of information…a nation that is afraid to let the people> judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation afraid of its> people.”That is what we have in this world today. Self-interest groups afraid of thepeople, and the Robot Radicals and the Robot Right are the same as all the rest.New Age – or the Old Age Revisited?The inflexibility of thought I am addressing here can be found in all areas of‘alternative’ thinking and lifestyles, including that which is known as the NewAge. Significant parts of the New Age are, I believe, becoming little more thananother religion which believes in reincarnation and it is seeking to impose itsgathering dogma on others. I have been fascinated to experience how those whospeak of freedom of thought and expression really mean freedom of thought andexpression which agrees with their own. This is what the old thinking does, asrevealed by the Robot Radicals, and yet here the old thinking is packaged as newthinking for a New Age. I feel we have to be careful about this because much ofthis ‘new thinking’ appears to me to be like an old car resprayed. On theoutside it looks new and fresh, but it is the same old vehicle underneath andthe rust is starting to show.One of the foundations of the New Age thinking is to urge people to ignore whatthe world may tell them they should think and to follow what their heart andintuition tells them. I could not agree more. But what do I see happening? I seepeople being told by elements within the New Age what they should think and do.This is not done as a suggestion, it is almost an order. Failing to accept this‘advice’ is seen as confirmation that you have gone “off your path”. For “offyour path” read “the path that someone else thinks you should be on”. Are suchpeople not seeking to impose their intuition and their belief system on othersinstead of respecting another’s right to follow their heart and instincts in theway they demand to be allowed to follow their own? I thought this was somethingthe New Age was supposed to be challenging, not perpetuating. I see censorshipin the New Age to keep out what would question the gathering and solidifyingdogma at its core, and if people now awakening to a new reality are sucked intothis, they could be swapping one form of thought control for another. What isright for one is not right for everyone and once you begin to impose dogmas,it’s the Old Age revisited.If you look at any organisation or movement, it invariably follows the samepattern. First it emerges to question the status quo of the time with anotherset of beliefs. Then, instead of evolving in the light of new information andexperience, it solidifies and turns those original beliefs into a dogma whichbecomes the status quo of the next generations. This dogma is defended with thesame unyielding vehemence as the old dogma displayed in the past. Anyone whocontinues to seek and move on in their thinking and perceptions, is condemned as“extreme”, “loony” and not to be taken seriously – the same response of the olddogma when it was defending itself. At this point, such a movement ororganisation ceases to be a vehicle for positive change and becomes a block onthat change. The Green Movement has been through this process. It is now a blockon further understanding because it refuses to encompass areas of spiritual andscientific thought which question its original thinking. The New Age Movementmoved beyond the Green hierarchy by encompassing the multidimensional view ofpeople and planet. But it, too, is now solidifying. It is fast becoming, insignificant areas, what the Green Movement has become: a form of suppression,dogma, and diversion, not freedom. The New Age says we are all equal and yetcreates the same hierarchical divisions of us and them, teachers and pupils,gurus and followers, that the Old Age has done.One mindset which has swept the New Age is the idea that some “Ashtar Command”1is going to send down spaceships to take off the chosen few. Maybe it’s just me,but that sounds remarkably like a cop-out and another version of the theme ofages – the messiah coming to save the good guys and good gals. All this can do –and does – is to create another form of dependency, another rigid belief system,when surely the transformation of humanity is about triggering everyone’spotential to be whatever they wish to be. I have learned of an Elite projectcalled Operation Bluebeam which is sending out thought waves on the wavelengthsthat channellers use. These messages are designed to mislead and divert peopleby purporting to come from extraterrestrials and other dimensions. Two of theinventions of Operation Bluebeam, according to an excellent source, are the“Ashtar Command” and the “Ascension” information. But make up your own mind.Workshops, meetings, and such like are great if they are designed to set free,to allow people to remember who they are and what they can do. But if they arestructured as the ‘Enlightened One’ teaching the less enlightened, it is anothermeans of giving the mind away. I see people promoted as “Britain’s leadinghealer” or “Britain’s leading psychic” or even “Maitreya, the Christ and WorldTeacher, a hero, a titan in men’s midst”. What is going on here? We are allhealers and all psychic. Who on Earth can say that one is better than the restand why do we feel the need to claim that anyway? We are all each other, allpart of the same whole, all with the potential of tapping into the healing forceand passing it on to others. I believe we should be working together, notclaiming superiority. But parts of the New Age are showing every sign of beingthe Old Age under another flag.The New Age has made a positive contribution and in many areas it is positive inits intent and achievements today. The world is a more enlightened place withthe New Age movement than without it. The same with the Green movement to anextent. But if we allow ourselves to be sucked into their dogma, we will be heldback from further discovery. No-one knows it all, or even nearly so. Thereforethere is always more to know. Getting caught up in rigid perceptions will keepus from that never-ending flow of knowledge that is ours for the taking if, andonly if, we keep our minds and hearts free from dogma.Christian PatriotismThe phenomena of the same thought patterns dressed up in different ways is trueof many areas of global conspiracy investigation. This consists of a vast arrayof different people and backgrounds, and I am not generalising about everyone.But I find here, too, the dogma and the illusion of freedom. The question Ialways ask when someone is proposing “freedom” is “Freedom to do what?” If youlook at many of the conspiracy investigators and organisations, particularly inthe United States, you often find that they are not talking about freedom, atall. In the USA, the loudest voice challenging the New World Order is that ofChristian Patriotism. This thought pattern believes that the problems in Americaand the world result from the decline of Christianity and the answer is torestore the United States as a patriotic Christian nation. That’ll fix it. Isthis the same patriotic Christian nation that destroyed without mercy the NativeAmerican civilisations which had lived on that continent for thousands of years?Is this the same nation that forced children generation after generation to betaught someone else’s beliefs and to be condemned if they didn’t accept them? Itsurely is. Those two dogmas of Christianity and Patriotism are, irony ofironies, two of the rigid mindsets which have been used continually over thecenturies to bring about the very New World Order the Christian Patriot now soopposes. They have been used because they are views of life with no shades ofgrey and whenever such thinking appears, manipulation is never far away. A childcould do it.I hear and read the views of some of those who are seeking to expose the NewWorld Order and I am glad that they are speaking out. But when I see where theyare coming from with their alternative society, I sometimes cringe in horror. Iwrote to one guy in America congratulating him on his efforts to expose theconspiracy, but when he sent me material about his organisation and its views, Iwas appalled. I was looking at tyranny spelled out as freedom. If all we aredoing is seeking to replace the control and imposition of the Global Elite withthe control and imposition of Christian Patriotism, or some other dogma, we arewasting our time. There is a difference between having smaller units ofgovernment with control in the hands of people and communities and thechest-out-chin-up-fight-for-your-country-flag-in-hand-god-on-our-side patriotismthat has been used by the Elite to play country against country century aftercentury. So again, if we fall into the dogma trap, we can jump out of the panand into the fire. We need to be selective in what we accept because no-one hasall the answers.This process of personal selection is not something that is encouraged, noroften even understood. The Robot Radical thought pattern, for instance, believesthat if you take a piece of information from a person or group you must, bydefinition, agree with everything that person or group stands for or says.Because I take information from sources like The Spotlight newspaper in the USA,I must therefore agree, according to the Robot Radicals, with everything thatnewspaper believes. I don’t. There is an enormous amount about its outlook onlife that is not only different, but opposite to mine. It is a bastion ofChristian Patriotism, for a start. But it does some excellent research and has along and proven record of accuracy. I am not going to ignore that researchbecause I don’t agree with everything the paper stands for. I am searching fortruth, not someone else’s version of political correctness.Because I quote from research by the Lyndon LaRouche organisation, the ExecutiveIntelligence Review, I must, by definition in the Robot Radical mind, agree witheverything they say and do. I don’t. Nothing like. But the Robot Radical lookson in bewilderment at that. If you only look at information that comes frompeople who share your own view of life, you deny yourself unimaginable amountsof information from other sources. This is what the Robot Radicals do, which iswhy they are so naïve and limited in their appreciation of what is happening inthe world. They are not interested in whether information is true, only thesource from which it came. If the source is not politically correct in theirchildish minds, the information is condemned and dismissed without a secondthought.One of the most compelling aspects of conspiracy research is the way thatthousands of people who would agree on almost nothing else, agree on the basicfoundations of the manipulation, names, organisations, events. There are peopleinvestigating the conspiracy with whom I have virtually nothing in common interms of our views on life. But if they come up with information which crosschecks with what others are coming up with, then I will use it.In Britain, Colonel Barry Turner has provided some excellent background for mefrom time to time. I don’t share his views on some things, nor he mine, but wedo share a passionate desire to expose the global tyranny. Therefore there ismutual exchange of information and support towards that end. It’s called beingadults. I have spent years challenging the policies of British Conservative MPslike Teddy Taylor and Theresa Gorman, but that doesn’t mean that I am not goingto support them in their contention that the United Kingdom has gone too far inhanding sovereignty to a centralised European cartel. The very idea ofsupporting a Conservative MP on anything would give a coronary to a red or greenRobot Radical. Yet it is this very selectivity and lack of dogma that frees usfrom the programming quicker than anything else and sets us on the road tomental, emotional, and physical freedom. Being selective and following our ownintuition is the only way to avoid that. Opening our minds doesn’t require us toaccept everything we hear. It requires us to look at all views and informationand to take from them what feels right to us and not just to someone else.One final point about the conspiracy research scene which relates very much tothe theme of the same thought patterns manifesting in different guises. There isan I-know-it-all arrogance in some areas of conspiracy ‘research’. Apparently, aconspiracy researcher has been telling people that I stopped going to his shopbecause I realised he knew more than I did. I know nothing of the man or hisshop, but his invented story reveals much about the mentality of some involvedin this area. Why aren’t we sharing information and supporting each otherinstead of claiming superiority? Conspiracy research is becoming another ‘club’with its hierarchy and ‘gurus’. Such rigidity makes it child’s play tomanipulate and infiltrate. Once we think we know it all, we are revealing howlittle we know. This book runs to 500 pages and yet it only scratches thesurface of what is happening.So What is Freedom?Those three versions of ‘freedom’, the Robot Radicals, elements of the New Ageand Christian Patriotism, are not to my eyes, freedom at all. They are differentways of saying: “I know best”. Freedom, for me, is the right of everyone tofollow the path they feel is correct for them and to respect another’s right tochoose a different path. The only time their behaviour deserves to be challengedis when they seek to impose their views on others. This requires a switch in ourattitudes. It means allowing people to believe things that we don’t agree withand to support their right to speak of those views openly without suppression.We need to start trusting ourselves. If a person says something we finddistasteful, and we are correct in that response, the people in general willreject what is being put to them. Better it is out in the open, anyway. When allinformation and views are allowed access to the public stage, people can make agenuine choice of what they wish to believe. We have a fusion of knowledge andnot an exclusion of knowledge.Centuries of the latter have led to the imbalanced understandings of the humanrace because we have been subjected to imbalanced, one-sided, information. Truthdoes not come in neatly packaged parcels with names like socialism, fascism,Christianity, or New Age. We need to search for it by looking at all informationand following our hearts. Yet one-way freedom is what I so often see. It isone-way freedom when Christian or Muslim fundamentalists try to stop meetings ofthose who disagree with their view of life and when prison and death sentencesare issued on people for believing something different. I don’t agree, as youmay have noticed, with the Robot Radicals, but they have every right to speaktheir views. If freedom means anything, it means freedom for all.This is crucial to the process of personal deprogramming. We cannot be freeuntil in our minds and our hearts we allow others to be free. The idea that weare mentally and spiritually free because we are following what we believe to beright is an illusion. We are only truly free when we are as determined thatothers should be able to do the same. The suppression of one human being oranimal is the suppression of all of us. When we have no desire to impose ourviews on others and when we celebrate diversity of thought and lifestyle thathave been freely chosen, then we can begin to say that the programming of thisworld and the Elite machine is breaking up and falling away within us. But notuntil.Getting StreetwiseWhen people begin to soften their inflexible thoughts and responses, theinfluence the daily programming has upon them is diffused also. They begin tosee the subtleties of mind manipulation in a way a rigid mind cannot. Thismental switch is open to everyone, no matter how unyielding their minds might benow. It can happen in an instant, once you decide you want it to happen.Scanning the information and the views available to us and picking out thoseaspects which we each feel good about involves taking pieces from everywhere andfitting them together to form our own evolving truth. When we are asked to put alabel on what we think and believe in these circumstances, we cannot answer. Weare not ‘Left’, nor ‘Right’, nor ‘Centre’. We are not a ‘religion’. We just are.There are no instant labels for that. There are no labels at all. We refuse tobe pigeon-holed because we are constantly seeking and evolving. If people canname an “ism” of any kind to describe what they believe, they are in some formof mental prison. The difference it makes when you let go of the labels and theoff-the-peg opinions and views promoted by the “isms” is beyond words. You seethe world so much more clearly. The smokescreens begin to disperse. An open mindis not a naïve one. Quite the opposite. Deprogramming demands that we areconstantly selective in what we accept minute by minute through the media andother sources. For example, if people are opposing something it would seemobvious that they are against it. But is this always the case?If you want to do something controversial, it is much easier if you also controlthe ‘opposition’ to what you are doing. You can ensure that while people havethe illusion of democratic opposition and the right to protest, those leadingthe main opposition group or groups will lead their followers to ultimate, if‘glorious’, failure. Everyone goes away thinking they all did their best andcould do no more, when the whole thing was being controlled as an exercise in‘democracy’ which was designed to fail in its goal of stopping whatever policyis involved. The sheep mentality is so ingrained in the human race that it takesvery few to infiltrate, direct, and control. Look at how one of the keyofficials of the Nation of Islam was working for the FBI in the period ofMalcolm X and the black civil rights movement in the 1960s. That story could berepeated a million times and more in ‘radical’ organisations all over the world.Some of the protest groups use violence. The Animal Liberation Front and ClassWar in Britain are two of them. When Class War, which claims to be ‘anti-state’,trigger violent clashes with the police during peaceful protest marches, whobenefits? Those in authority who want to dismiss the peaceful opponents to theirpolicies as “violent extremists” and those who wish to introduce moreauthoritarian laws to meet the challenge from the growth in (manufactured)“violent extremists”. Put it this way. If Class War was an arm of BritishIntelligence, they could not do a better job of undermining the vast majority ofpeople who wish to protest peacefully. When thousands of people gather toprotest peacefully against the treatment of animals and a few idiots becomeviolent or plant bombs, who benefits? Those in authority who wish to continue totreat animals with great cruelty while dismissing the protesters as “violentextremists”. An open mind can see this, a rigid mind cannot.Feeling and HealingEven more important than thinking for ourselves is to feel for ourselves. In thecentre of the chest we have a feeling centre called the heart chakra or heartvortex. It is from here that we express love in the fullest sense. It is fromhere also, and the solar plexus chakra, that we instinctively feel if somethingis right for us. It doesn’t need words or explanations, it just feels right.This is our intuition speaking to us and our intuition is our connection to ourhigher consciousness. When I am faced with a choice between what my mind or myintuition is telling me, I go with the intuition every time these days. I oftencan’t explain why I go to a certain place or embark on an area of explorationand research. It simply feels right to do so. The mind, even an open one, can beinfluenced by the daily programming to some extent and it can go through listsof reasons why what our intuition is suggesting is not a good idea. “What willmy friends think? What about this or that consequence? Don’t do it, you fool!”The feeling centre is not subject to those pressures because it is connected toa level of consciousness and knowledge that is beyond the manipulations of thisphysical world. As the spiritual renaissance proceeds, the feeling centre isbeing powerfully reactivated among those who are awakening, and intuition isgoing to be the guide of the future. It will not always lead us to where ourrational mind wants to be, but it will always lead us to where we need to be forour own and the planet’s evolution. If I had followed my rational mind since1990, I would still be sitting in television studios presenting sportsprogrammes. I find the thought of still doing that quite awful!It is the intuition more than anything that can help us to weave a path throughthe maze of misleading messages and manipulation our eyes and minds face everyday. When this feeling centre becomes more sensitive to us, we will know thatsomething feels instinctively right or wrong. When the mind opens and becomesless influenced by dogma and trivia, the more powerfully we feel our intuition.The mind steps aside, gets out of the way. It has a part to play, of course, aspart of a balance, but it is not there to dominate. A rigid mind, full ofprogrammed perceptions, overpowers the intuition and delinks us from that flowof inspiration and guidance from our higher levels of understanding – missioncontrol. In these circumstances, the feeling centres shut down like dormantvolcanos. Therefore I do not accept that everyone on the planet is doingprecisely what they came to do, as some New Age thinking believes. We are allborn into the circumstances we choose, but as we travel through life we can bediverted by other influences if we allow ourselves to accept the programming andclose down the potential of the feeling centres, particularly the heart vortex,to guide us. If we do that we can become like a ship without a rudder andcomplete very few of the tasks we came to achieve. I am sure there must be manypeople who incarnated this time to play a big role in the transformation whohave become so shut down by their programmed minds that they are laughing at, orcondemning, those who are doing what they came to do! This situation, however,can be put right very quickly. Once we allow that flow of inspiration fromhigher levels to gather its power and guide us, the magnetic interaction withother energy fields – people, places, situations – will draw to us all thesupport, experiences, and opportunities we need to evolve both individually andcollectively. This flow of inspiration and guidance is not to give ourresponsibility away. The guidance is not coming from some outside force. It iscoming from a higher level of us. It is still the “I”, the multidimensionalself. When we reconnect powerfully with that, we are instantly deprogrammed.I am asked by many people for advice on what they should do and I always replyin the same way. I don’t know what is best for anyone else. I only know what Ifeel is best for me. The only person who knows what you should do, where youshould go, or what you should think and say, is…you.What does your heart tell you? Right. Go for it!> SOURCES> > > 1 The “Ashtar Command” information sounds really doubtful to me. I get> > > seriously negative “vibes” whenever I hear the name.

As a result,we project into the world this self-dislike, even self-hatred, the spiritualcancer within us. The inner turmoil becomes the outer turmoil reported on thenews bulletins. Some of the most aggressive people I have met have been thosewho hate themselves and have no love or respect for themselves. If our thoughtsand attitudes change, so must life on this planet. If we heal ourselves, we healthe world. The Prison Warder Consciousness knows all this. To maintain the outerchaos and conflict, they know that we humans have to be manipulated into innerchaos and conflict. We will then be broadcasting the thought waves, energies,that reflect our inner state of dis-ease and dis-harmony into the energy fieldsof the Earth, thus creating the outer, planetary, dis-ease and dis-harmony,which is so essential to the maintenance of the vibratory prison. Dogmaticreligion has been used to fantastic effect over thousands of years to fuel andexploit emotions like fear and guilt, and the feeling of being ‘unworthy’. Thishas encouraged people to hand over their right to think and feel to a Bible anda priest because they have not had the confidence or self-belief to realise thatthey have a right, and an infinite gift, to make their own decisions. As thepower of religion has waned in the face of ‘science’, politics, and economics,these have become the new religions with new books and priests – scientists,politicians, economists – to whom we can concede our right to think and feel. Weare encouraged to deny our own infinite potential. We are “born sinners”,apparently, and I cringe when I hear the mass of humanity described as the“common people” or “the ordinary man and woman in the street”, or whenpoliticians describe the population as “our people”, as if we are children whomust be looked after by their higher intelligence.There are no ‘ordinary people’. There are no ‘common people’. There are onlyglorious expressions of the one consciousness that is creation. Each aspect isunique, equally special, and loved by the source of all that is. Each one is onan eternal journey of evolution through experience and all have the potential todo anything and be anything we want to be.The process of awakening and deprogramming will be stifled and, at worst,suffocated unless we let go of these programmed responses like fear, guilt, andthe sense of worthlessness. Every second, we are taking in energies from thecosmos around us and from other levels of our own consciousness. These are the‘feeling’, ‘intuitive’, energies I have spoken about. This flow and connectioncomes in through the base chakra (vortex) in the genitals area and up throughthe central channel to the other major chakras. It also flows the other way,too. From here it affects all areas of our physical, emotional, mental, andspiritual being. When this flow is powerful and harmonious we are operating atour full intuitive potential, but this can only be achieved when we are at peacewith ourselves. Like everything, emotions such as fear, guilt, and resentment,are an energy. These deep-seated and often long-held emotions act like darkknots of energy which eat us away and are, if not dealt with and released, amajor cause of dis-eases such as cancer and heart problems. They block ordiminish the natural, powerful, flow of intuitive energies, as they pass throughour levels of being.You might see these knots of energy symbolically like dams or big rocks in afast flowing river, slowing down the flow and causing disharmony as eddies andwhirlpools are created. In a way, the vibratory prison is like a vast knot ofnegative energy which is holding back the flow of energies in this part of thecosmos; hence other levels and civilisations are as keen as we are to remove it.When we lack self-worth and have feelings of fear and guilt, it holds us backfrom reconnecting with our true, whole, selves. Yet, when you look from thespiritual perspective at what makes us feel fearful and guilty, it all seems soridiculous. Fear, guilt, and resentment are not emotions we have to feel. Theyare emotions we create for ourselves by locking into the programming which ispassed on and intensified across the generations.FearLook at the bottom line of human existence, something that cannot be taken awayfrom us: today is the first day of the rest of our eternity, and the Source ofall that is has a love for all of us that is equal, beyond words, and eternal.As we reconnect with levels of ourselves which are outside the jammingvibration, we can begin to feel this incredible love and broadcast it into thisphysical world. When you connect with that love, a love without judgement orcondition, there simply is no fear or guilt. You know there is nothing to fear.It is of our own creation and it is within the power of our hearts and minds toun-create it. To be without fear is not to be without awareness. I have heard itsaid that fear is essential for survival because it is that which stops uswalking across the street in front of a car or jumping into a lion’s cage. Butfear and awareness are not the same. You don’t have to be fearful to know theconsequences of something and avoid them. In fact fear is often the cause ofunpleasant events, not the protection from them.It is the use and manipulation of fear that has allowed people like AverellHarriman and Henry Kissinger to tell two countries the (often invented)aggressive intentions of the other and so bring about conflict. Each countrystrikes out of the fear of what the other is planning, or alleged to beplanning, to do. Each one thinks: “We must destroy them before they destroy us”.“Get your retaliation in first,” as a soccer manager I knew used to say. War isoverwhelmingly the physical manifestation of fear. It is the opposite polarityto love, trust, and respect – the protectors from war and disharmony. If weremove fear from ourselves, we remove our contribution to fear in the world.Removing fear from the world, removes war and disharmony. Once again it startswith us.Fear is indivisibly connected with a lack of self-worth and self-respect. Allthree are the result of looking outside ourselves for confirmation that we areok. The reason most people say they can’t speak in public is fear. And the fearcomes from being concerned about what the audience thinks of them. They arelooking to the audience to confirm that what they are saying and doing is rightand they fear those people will either reject what they say or think them to bean idiot. Put the would-be public speaker in an empty room or among theirtrusted family and friends and they would be fine expressing their views. Putthem in front of an audience and they can hardly speak for nerves and lack ofconfidence. When you begin to reconnect and understand the true nature of thehuman being, you begin to look within for confirmation that you’re an ok person.It doesn’t matter what people think of you and what you say. They have a rightto think what they like – and so have you.The only person you have to convince that what you are doing is right, is you.Of course we need to listen to all views and information, but if you are in tunewith that flow of intuition from higher levels of yourself, you, and no-oneelse, will know what is right for you to do and say. Once you realise that, andlive it, you no longer stand up in front of an audience worrying about what theywill think of you because you accept that they have every right to disagree. Youknow that what really matters is what you think of you. Perhaps the mosteffective form of information suppression is the fear of those who thinkdifferently to the status quo, but are frightened of speaking out and passing onwhat they know and feel. It is time for that to end.Many people tell me they fear for my safety because of the ‘powers’ I amchallenging and exposing in this book and The Robots’ Rebellion, and for what Isay in the media and on the speaking tours. I can honestly say, hand on heart,that I feel no such fear. I try to avoid unnecessary hassle that will affect myability to communicate information to a wide audience, but when I believesomething to be right and in need of communication, I do not fear theconsequences. First of all, I feel enormously protected in a way I could notexpress in words, and secondly, what’s the worst that can happen? My eternalself leaves this physical shell and moves on to another parallel world, anotherwavelength of reality. That doesn’t sound too bad to me. I have had the benefitof experiencing years of severe and, for a while, constant ridicule in theUnited Kingdom. It was impossible to walk down a street, literally anywhere,without being pointed at, shouted at, and laughed at. This has diminished, butit still goes on today among those who have accepted without a thought orquestion what the media say I stand for. Such experiences have shown me howcompletely the vast majority give their minds away and, most important on apersonal level, that no matter what people say about you or do about you, no-onecan stop you if you refuse to be intimidated and you look to yourself forself-assurance and not to others. What does it matter what others think of you?People change what they think all the time and if we constantly seek to conformto the prevailing beliefs we just become clones of another’s opinion – oftenprogrammed opinion – instead of masters of our own hearts, minds, and destiny.There is nothing to fear.GuiltWhen I host weekend workshops and we talk about guilt, I never cease to beamazed at the wonderful people before me who speak, movingly, of the guilt theyfeel. Beautiful spirits who ooze warmth and love reveal sometimes a lifetime ofinner turmoil and emotional pain caused by guilt. It blights their lives and, interms of self-worth and the flow of intuitive energies from the higher realms,it is terribly destructive. Guilt, like fear, is a creation designed to control.But, again, when you analyse what makes us feel guilty, it is programmed‘values’, mostly from generations long passed. There are Roman Catholic priestsall over the world with sexual feelings they battle to suppress and with a senseof guilt at those natural feelings which fills their days with emotionaldistress. Do you know why they are forced to go through this nonsense? Becauseone Pope decided in 1074 that clergy should be celibate. Sex and relationshipsare perhaps the most awesome of the countless vehicles for the creation ofguilt. If people have had a sexual experience with someone who is not theirofficial partner, they feel guilty and if news of it gets out, they are made tofeel even more guilty by a society which has been programmed to inherit ‘values’without question.How would the tabloid newspapers fill their pages every day without passingjudgement on the morals of the rich and famous? And how many people with much tooffer the world have been destroyed by such ‘exposés’, in papers who would notknow a moral if it bit them on the bum? But hold on a minute, here. Who saidthat expressing love for another human being (another aspect of ourselves) iswrong unless it is the official partner? Did you decide that? The guy down thestreet? Who? Religion decided it thousands of years ago, as I explain in TheRobots’ Rebellion. And who or what was controlling religion? These same peoplewere also vehemently insistent at the time they decided on this form of“morality” that the Earth was flat and Jerusalem was the centre of the universe.And yet we go on judging ourselves and others and either feeling guilty ormaking others feel guilty on the basis of what people thousands of years agodecided was right. It’s just crazy.Who owns your body? You or someone else? Who owns your emotions and yourspiritual self? You or someone else? If you accept the above imposition theanswer is someone else. You are allowing them to impose thought and behaviourpatterns upon you which, if you go against them, create an enormous sense ofguilt. This area of love, sex, and relationships is a minefield of guilt whichis holding back so many people from reconnecting with their true and whole self.When you look behind the words and the cliches surrounding relationships, we arenot looking at love. We are looking at a form of possession. I love you,therefore I own you. Yet what is real love? It is a love so endless and withoutjudgement or condition, that we love a person for what they are, not what we saythey must be if we are to love them. We love them so much that we want them toexperience whatever they need to experience to ensure that they can learn,evolve, and achieve what they have come here to do. We have no wish to possessanother human being, only to love them. How many can truly say on that basisthat they love someone? I am not saying here that we shouldn’t respect thefeelings of a partner. Of course we should, but we have feelings, too, and alifeplan for our experience, service to Creation, and evolution. When you lookat what makes people feel emotional pain over sex and relationships, it islargely the result of programming. It has little to do with what is right orwrong and everything to do with what that society has been programmed toperceive as right or wrong over hundreds of years.If a person was born into a rigid, sexually suppressive society, their emotionswould be blitzed by their partner expressing physical love for another, eventhough the love that partner had for them remained undiminished or was evenstrengthened. But if that same person was born in a loving and sexually opensociety in which expressing physical love for each other was as natural as thesea and sky, there would not be the same emotional pain in exactly the samecircumstances. Sex has been turned, by design I most strongly feel, into a formof suppression, control, and limitation. Guilt is the major factor in achievingall three. And if the power of the base (sexuality) chakra can be diminished, wedon’t absorb energy to our full potential. This affects our life span andcreativity. On the one hand, sex has been presented as something sinful anddirty, thanks to the influence of religion, and on the other it has become formany a merely physical experience, a means of releasing physical desires andfrustrations. Both, I believe, are a travesty of what sex really is. Indeed Iwould say there was a chasm of difference between sex (physical) and spirituallove (physical/spiritual).The act of spiritual love is an explosion of spiritual energy. It is themultidimensional expression of spiritual, emotional, and physical love and allthose energies are created and merged to affect positively both the individualsand the Earth. Spiritual love between two people is a positive contribution tothe world because of the love and thought patterns it creates. So why are wesupposed to feel guilty about it? Some Eastern philosophies acknowledge thistruth and their view of sex and relationships is consequently different from theWestern version which, as I saw in a quite awful publication by the Britishgovernment’s Health Education Authority,1 has turned sex into the spiritualequivalent of artificial insemination.At the moment of orgasm our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levelsare as One and we are as One with our highest potential. All our energy centresare wide open. This is a moment when we can reconnect and feel the bliss of thatexperience if the intent is loving and spiritual. As with everything, however,there is a downside to this if the intent is negative. Orgasm under thosecircumstances opens up the energy centres to connection with the lowervibrational, malevolent consciousness and this, I believe, is why so many of thedark esoteric ceremonies involve sex and orgasmic experience. Whenever I look atsomething which helps us to reconnect with our highest potential, be it sexuallove, self-love, or the free flow of information, I find that it has been, bycalculated design at the Prison Warders level, distorted and manipulated. Ourview of sex and relationships is one very important example of this and itcreates a tidal wave of guilt in the collective human mind. I will return tothis theme in a future book devoted to this subject. Again, we need to followour intuition. Does it feel right to express physical love for someone, whoeverthey may be? Your mind may be shouting “guilt” at you in a gathering panic. Butwhat does your feeling centre, your heart, say? If it says yes and it feels likethe most natural thing in the world, then what could possibly be wrong withthat? It is possible to love more than one person at the same time. It ispossible to love all people and all lifeforms at the same time, in manydifferent ways. It is possible to love those who love us and love those who hateus. So why do we say that everyone needs to love everyone to build a betterworld and yet feel guilty on the occasions when our bodies are involved? What acontradiction it all is. The body is only a vehicle for the eternal self, afterall. A magnificent vehicle, yes, and an extension of us while in incarnation,but still a vehicle and not the eternal self. I am not calling for a sort ofopen-house-all-in-together-free-love society. It is up to the individualsinvolved to decide what their heart and intuition tells them. If people want tolive together and not have sexual experience with anyone else, great, wonderful,fantastic. But while they have a right to make the decision of what they believeis right for them, others have an equal right to make a different choice. It isnot a better or worse choice, it is merely different. So there is nojustification for guilt to be felt by those involved, nor for guilt to beimposed by others who seek to make everyone else conform to their version ofmorality.There is so much that society demands we should feel guilty about. We look backat the way we treated our parents. We feel guilty if we did not fulfil in ourlives what our parents wanted us to achieve. We think we have let them down. Wefeel guilty at the way, perhaps, we treated our own children or other lovedones. We feel guilty if we work so much that we don’t see enough of ourfamilies. We feel guilty if we don’t work enough and can’t give our children thematerial things they are programmed to want. You name it and someone, somewhere,will feel guilty about it.Enough!Fear and guilt are there to control us, divide us, diminish us, and limit us.Let them go. These things have to be seen from a much bigger, spiritual,perspective. First of all we choose where and with whom we incarnate. We chooseour parents and they choose us. Instead of holding onto the guilt and resentmentof what we see as an unpleasant childhood or the feeling of letting down ourparents, we need to ask ourselves why we chose those experiences and why ourparents did. What was that interaction of people designed to achieve for allparties? My father gave me a hard time mentally and emotionally, but thatexperience turned out to be essential to tap the mental and emotional toughnessI needed to cope with what has happened to me since 1990. The experiences mywife and children have had as a result of what I have said and done has had thesame effect on them. Experiences that seem terrible in the moment can be seen,with the hindsight and knowledge of passing years, to be gifts which allow us todeprogramme from the shallow, manipulated, superficial world we have allowed tosolidify around us. We are not here to fulfil our parents’ ambitions for us. Weare here to serve the planet in the most effective way, fling open the prisondoor, and speed our own, and the collective, evolution. In the same way, we arenot here to impose our beliefs and ambitions on our children. We have not cometo serve a system created by the manipulators which insists we must work dayafter day under someone else’s control or feel guilty or unworthy if we don’t.Nor are we here to play the material game by allowing guilt about our childrento make us feel terrible when we can’t give them what their friends may have. Wecan give them something that is beyond price. We can give them unconditionallove and we can help them to reconnect with their highest potential. You can’tbuy that at the computer game store.Another form of guilt is that felt by awakening people at not thinking‘perfect’, loving thoughts about everyone all the time. We need to be kind toourselves here. In this imbalanced world, some terrible events happen and we arenot going to be immune to the emotions they attract. When I saw Bill and HillaryClinton sitting with assembled children and television cameras in the WhiteHouse taking political advantage of the Oklahoma bombing, I did not have lovingthoughts, I can tell you. Nor am I immune from the frustation of being attackedby those who talk of “freedom”. It is the way we deal with those emotions thatmatters. That is very different from not feeling them. We really would be robotsif that were the case. The more we open up to our higher consciousness, theeasier it is to keep thinking positively, but it’s a process we evolve throughand if we feel bad about feeling bad, it will only hold us back by accumulatingmore guilt.Pattern BreakingAnother form of guilt is this word, karma. It is expressed in many religions andcultures and can be summed up by “what you do to others will be done to you”. Iaccept that karma exists and I believe it can be expressed as creating our ownreality. It is not a punishment, it is a gift. I also feel, as I have said inother books, that karma is created by the intent behind an action, not theaction itself. If we do something with good intent and it doesn’t work out, welearn from the experience, but there is no ‘karma’. If, however, we do somethingthat appears to be positive, but it has an ulterior, negative intent behind it,there will be a karmic reaction which will lead us into a situation in which weface what we have done to another. The reason for this is that positive intentand negative intent create different thought patterns and so attract a differentreality. But there are two points to make about karma. One is that it is toooften presented as punishment and people feel guilty when negative things happento them because it must be the result of something terrible they have done. Andthe second is that to explain everything that happens to us as our ‘karma’ (howwe have behaved in the past) is, in my view, misleading and simplistic.In this amazing period of spiritual and, therefore, physical transformation,large numbers of people are going through sometimes extreme experiences,negative and positive. These are not all ‘karmic’ experiences, from where I amsitting. They are the prearranged means by which we are being given theopportunity to deprogramme ourselves. These experiences may be the breakup of along-term relationship, the loss of a job, an illness, or our whole life beingturned upside down in some other way. The common denominator of all of them isto make our status quo disappear. Whatever choices we make in the light of theseevents, one thing is certain: the status quo, life as it has been, is not anavailable option. They ensure some kind of change, often a massive one.The colossal spiritual awakening that I experienced in 1990-91 happened sopublicly that my television career was destroyed. My status quo was demolishedand a great change in my life had to take place. That was not my ‘karma’, in thesense of punishment for past deeds; it was the opportunity to break out of theprison of thought control. If life gets too comfortable and cosy in the samethought pattern – rut – it can be very difficult to step out of it and move on.Sometimes an upheaval in our lives is necessary to present us with such anopportunity. It seems terrible at the time, but from my own experience and thecountless people I have met who have been through this process, you always lookback at such events as gifts and not punishment. Energy codings in ourconsciousness are triggered, often by astrological influences, to create changewithin our magnetic aura and, therefore, our physical lives. This is especiallytrue today with the Great Transformation upon us.The process I have described is pattern breaking, in this case, our personalthought patterns. But we are also affecting other, collective, thought patternsas we open up to the higher frequencies. A lot of people ask why life can be sotough sometimes, even when we have given our commitment to do whatever isnecessary to support the transformation. I have asked that question myself, manytimes! As I said earlier, some of it will be caused by the facing and cleansingof inner thought patterns from the past we didn’t know we had, but I believethat people who have come specifically to support the transformation alsooperate like spiritual kidney machines. They absorb negative emotions andthought patterns into their energy fields and transform them into another,higher, state. At the time these are being processed by the person, however,they will be living that emotion and experience. They might feel depressed,angry, or in despair, when there is nothing apparently happening in their lifethat should make them feel like that. Then those feelings will go quite suddenlywithout any obvious reason. This, for me, is the process of collective patternbreaking and negative energy dispersal. It is a very positive contribution. Butpeople who are doing this without knowing it often feel guilty at some of theemotions they are feeling. So much is happening that we don’t understand andonly when we stop judging ourselves from the viewpoint of the programmed statusquo will we be able to release our feelings of guilt and fear.ResentmentThis is another emotional cancer which manifests in so much individual andglobal self-destruction. If we create our own reality, whatever we experience isof our creation. We attract to us an energy field – person and experience –which can reflect our inner self as a physical reality before our eyes. Or, asin the case of the Robot Radicals, they unknowingly help to highlightinformation by attacking it, so helping us to fulfil our task. Those otherpeople we resent for what they have done to us have their own imbalances to faceand maybe we can help them to do that by our reaction to their behaviour. How wereact is an opportunity to look at our inner self. And there is certainly nojustification for the resentment we still hold against another person becausethey were an outer expression, a mirror, of the inner us. Responsibility forwhat happens to us begins and ends with us. People resent the success of otherswhen the only difference between them is the different realities they havecreated. And who suffers from the resentment we hold onto about others? We do.We punish ourselves by clinging to such patterns and it negatively affects oursense of self and reality. We’re the losers in this, not those we resent. Onegood way I find of letting go of guilt and resentment is to visualise the personor experience involved with a thread connecting them to me. I then project loveat the person and experience, thank them for the gift of knowledge, andvisualise the thread being cut and the person/experience drifting away, nolonger part of my inner pattern. The Global Elite use resentment to great effectto start conflicts and to keep them going as each side becomes more resentful atthe acts of the other. One expression of this is the so called “tit for tat”killings in the world’s trouble spots. If we release our resentment, we help theplanet and humanity as a whole to release theirs. But the biggest winner when wedo this is ourselves.If you have done something in your life that you regret or you feel guilty forthe effect it has had on others, remember this: you have all eternity to putright what you have done and the experience you put someone through wasprecisely what that person needed for his or her evolution. You are sittingthere feeling guilty when, viewed from a higher level of understanding, you havemade a positive contribution to their eternal journey. Turn this around from theother perspective of what others have done to you and you see resentment in thesame light. And if you have made ‘mistakes’, how do you know they have not beenan essential, and preplanned, part of your own learning which can help you andothers? Who is the best person to help an alcoholic or drug addict? Someone whohas read about it in a book or passed an exam? Or someone who has been there andknows exactly what it is like? There are no such thing as mistakes, onlylearning from experience. Accept ‘mistakes’ as a gift, absorb the knowledge, andmove on. Fear, resentment and guilt are yet more by-products of dogma. Theyresult from rigid responses to rigid ‘values’. Step out of the dogma and youstep out of the by-products.I Am What I AmThere is a great song by Shirley Bassey called I Am What I Am and there is oneparticularly telling line which says: “I am what I am and what I am needs noexcuses”. Says it all. When you follow the guidance of that feeling centre, yourheart, you are doing whatever you need to do with whomever you need to do it.You are not your brother, or the guy across the street, or the famous person onthe television screen. You are you and you are a wonderful you. Every bit asspecial and unique as anyone else. And your path is not my path or anyoneelse’s. It is yours and yours alone. So while we are all part of the same whole,all part of each other, we are the sum total of all our experiences since wefirst became conscious and that means we are at different points in the journey,with different things to offer and different things to learn. If we allow fear,resentment, and guilt to make us conform to another’s thought pattern and valuesystem, we give away the uniqueness of our contribution to the world and we losethe opportunity for experiences designed specifically for us. It doesn’t matterwhat you have done in the past. That has gone. It is what you are now, thismoment, that is important. I don’t care if you have served a prison sentence foran unpleasant crime. I don’t care if you have been Jesus Christ or Adolf Hitler.What are you now, this second?Hold on to the uniqueness that is you. Why should you conform to someone else’spattern? Why should you be what someone else insists that you be? You have spentforever developing that uniqueness. Why be a clone now? The pressure to conformis simply the pressure to control. The Global Elite and itsIlluminati-Brotherhood cannot control and manipulate billions of people who areexpressing their full potential and their uniqueness of view. It can only bedone by mass mind control that directs the overwhelming majority to think thesame. Only then do you have the herd mentality, the unthinking, unquestioningsheep, following the guy at the front. How would you control a herd of sheep ifthey all went their different ways, refusing to follow the one at the front andinstead following their own hearts and what felt right for them? You simplycannot control them. So being the unique you and resisting the pressure to be aclone is not only to follow your own path and express your true self. It isalso, by definition, to dismantle the means of global control.Nothing has succeeded in denying our uniqueness more than religion. God save usfrom religion. It has been a tool and a creation of the Prison Warders and ithas done more than anything over the centuries to enforce the uniformityessential to mass control. It is, as I have said before, psychological fascism.The divisions of race and colour are used in the same way. If you are born intoa certain religion or culture, you must follow their rules. If you do not, youare a traitor. Such an approach is not an expression of love and freedom. It isthe suppression of both. If you are a victim of such a religion or culture bybirth, you do have a choice. You can conform and take, in the short term, butonly the short term, the road of least resistance. Or, like gathering numbers,you can acknowledge your own uniqueness, your own mind, and your power tocontrol your own destiny. Remember, too, that you chose to incarnate in thesituation that you have. So why did you make that choice? Just to be anotherclone? It is rather more likely that it was to give yourself the opportunity toserve Creation, your own evolution, and your fellow men and women by strikingout from the mental prison and shouting to everyone who can hear: “I will not beimprisoned by the mind of another. I am what I am and what I am needs noexcuses!”I read an article by a Jewish-born writer called Jon Ronson who wrote of the wayhis religion and culture have reacted to him. He could quite easily have beenspeaking of the extreme versions of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or so manyyou-will-believe-this-because-I-say-so cultures and belief systems. Jon Ronsonwrote an article in the London Time Out magazine about his attendance at theJewish funeral of his grandmother, in which he recalled:> “I’m the only person in the room who doesn’t understand what the hell’s going> on. I’m jealous of the warmth of their identity, embarrassed and guilty of my> ignorance. Everybody is singing the Hebrew verse, and I am reading the England> translations… 2,000 years of 100 per cent, pure-bred Orthodox Ronsons without> a hint of goyism [Gentile] in the genes, and the bloodline ends here.”Ronson wrote another article three weeks later in another magazine or paperdetailing the reaction of fellow Jews to his remarks. Someone sent me aphotocopy of this anonymously through the post and so I can’t tell you the dateor the publication. He highlighted one letter which “spat out”, as he put it,the fact that he was no better than David Irving, a man who has been vilifiedfor challenging the official stories of the Nazi gas chambers. The letter wenton: “I speak for all [my emphasis] Jews when I say how you have betrayed andshamed us. We are pleased that your bloodline ends here.” There we have yetanother individual claiming to speak for all and telling everyone what theyshould think and do. A clone leading clones. The people who have bodies whichare Jewish or Roman Catholic or Islamic or whatever, cannot be legitimatelyreferred to as one entity. They are, like all races and peoples, an example ofCreation’s infinite beauty and uniqueness. The Jewish hierarchy in theirdesperation to control are denying the full expression of thought and potentialthat Jewish people can offer the world. It is the same with other extremereligions, too. And this is causing so much pain for those who wish to bethemselves and not what the self-appointed thought-police demand that they be.In his article, Ronson said of the letter from the man claiming to speak for allJews:> “The letter shocked the hell out of me at first, and then it made me smile. I> photocopied it, and sent it – as reply – to the scores of Jews who had written> to me in empathy with the column: Jews who have discovered heathenism to be a> pleasanter, and more viable, experience than the cut-throat, school-bully,> world of official Judaism… On top of the photocopy, I wrote: ‘This is what> we’re leaving behind. Makes you proud doesn’t it?’> “And does it make me proud? It’s hard being part of the new, disenfranchised> generation of young Jews: Jews who feel, deep down, that our culture is a> destructive, arcane, racist, and sectarian one.

But don’t you realise – you’re the one who’s> driving us away. And, judging by the volume of mail I received, you’re driving> us away in droves.”However, freedom for one must mean freedom for all and Jon Ronson would laterreveal his one dimensional view of freedom. While he wishes to be free to behimself, he is less inclined that others should enjoy the same priviledge. As ajournalist on the London Guardian, he rang a BBC TV programme called GoodMorning With Anne And Nick which had invited me to discuss the first edition ofthis book. After Ronson’s call the invitation was withdrawn by the programme, adecision “justified” by an excuse which insulted the intelligence. Ronson laterwrote an article about me which, as witnesses will confirm, gave an outrageouslyinaccurate account of our short meeting. When you respect another’s freedom, MrRonson, you will enjoy freedom yourself. But not until. You create your ownreality, as we all do.If you are being imprisoned by Judaism, Roman Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, orone of the others, you have the opportunity to make a great contribution to thefreedom of yourself and those in your position. The awakening of the humanconsciousness will turn the droves into a tidal wave of people walking away fromthis intergenerational thought and behaviour control. Many volunteers haveincarnated into these cultures and religions at this time to do just that. Asthese structures crumble and fall, the hierarchies will be seen as they reallyare: able to lead and cling on to power only by fear, guilt, and mental andemotional suppression.Don’t deny what you believe, what you think and feel, just because they aredifferent to the prevailing culture in which you find yourself. Those beliefsand feelings are you. If you deny them, you are denying the real you. What goodis that to anyone? Fear, guilt, dogma: these are the vehicles of human control.Without them there can be no control, no Global Elite. You can let them go nowif you so choose. In doing this, you will be contributing to creating the worldwe wish to see for ourselves and those who follow. The means to build that worldlies within you and within me.

I don’tknow where you come from or your race, colour, creed, or income. I frankly don’tcare because these temporary states are only vehicles for experience, anyway.But I do know a great deal about you in other ways. I know that you are part ofme and I am part of you because we are all aspects of the same infiniteconsciousness that we call God and Creation. I know that you are a uniqueexpression of that consciousness as the sum total of all your experiences. Iknow your potential to love and create is without limit and without end. I knowthese things because every lifeform on this planet and anywhere else you wouldcare to name, has those same abilities, that same limitless potential. You cando anything you want to do and be anything you wish to be. You just have tobelieve it and make it happen. It is the awakening understanding of our trueselves and the end of limitation which will bring an end to the manipulation Ihave detailed in this book. This is already happening.The speed with which life will change on Earth in our generation will defy theimagination. I know that many people who have opened up to another understandingfind it hard to accept just how fast the new world and the new Earth will emergeover the next 35 years, even the next ten. But think of it in these terms. Weare trapped in a vibratory prison. Imagine it is a physical prison cell. Whileinside that cell, our potential to act and achieve is enormously limited. Butthe moment the door is opened, that potential soars. Suddenly, it is not onlythe door that is opened to us. It is the world, also. Yet the time span betweenthose two states of severe limitation and freedom is the fraction of a second ittakes to step through the door. In the time it took to make that one step, ourlives would be transformed. The principle is the same with the vibratory prison.The moment that blocking, jamming frequency is dispersed and humanity returns to‘wholeness’ and multidimensional reconnection with its higher consciousness,this world will change for the better in an incredibly short time. We are now inthe transitional period between those two states of being…the prison and thefreedom.I believe that the period we call Atlantis was the last full scale attempt tobreak the blocking frequency. Consciousness of high evolution entered thethree-dimensional prison and became incarnate on Earth to challenge the PrisonWarder vibration. I feel that many of these spiritual volunteers (who arrivedwith the best of intent) became intoxicated by this rare vibratory environmentand were negatively affected by it under a thought-bombardment from the FourthDimension. Those Atlantean volunteers who allowed their vibratory state to fallbelow that of the jamming frequency, found themselves trapped and unable toleave until they had, through experience, raised their frequency again to alevel that allowed them to escape. They, like the rest of the prisoners,embarked on a cycle of incarnation and reincarnation trying to createexperiences and learning that would restore them to a state of love andenlightenment that would open the vibratory door. Those who managed it weresaid, in symbolic language, to have ‘ascended’ to the ‘Father’.Such an achievement was extremely difficult because the consciousness within theprison was delinked from its powerful connection with the higher consciousnessoutside. This has created the reincarnation cycle, which, for some, I believe,involves incarnating with little pattern or plan. The dense physical world hasbecome like a drug with minds – souls – attracted to certain lifestyles andexperiences like a cocaine addict is consumed by his or her addiction. I am surethat many of the people I call the Elite have had scores of physical lifetimesin which they pursued the same pattern of control and manipulation. Thoughtpatterns of many kinds can become like a rut, a needle stuck in a record,repeating over and over. They might be attracted to certain family lines becausethey know those lines will allow them to continue with their addiction.Other Atlanteans managed to stay in greater contact with their higherconsciousness while still in the prison and continued to select theirincarnations with a view to gaining experience of this strange and suppressingvibration in preparation for a future mass incarnation to break the jammingfrequency. This is the period we are living through today. Since Atlantis, otherhighly evolved consciousnesses have entered the prison to experience and preparefor this time.My own view is that the ‘volunteer’ consciousness has come back from the futureand that the star system known as the Pleiades is very much involved. Thisrelates to the idea of simultaneous ‘time’ in which the past, present, andfuture are all happening at once. Mind blowing, I know. I get a headache justthinking about it. But I do feel that the consciousness of those who are herespecifically to free the Earth and the human race from suppression andoppression, came from a time-space reality far in the ‘future’ of this universe.Time travel is very much a reality, as perhaps even the elite human scientistshave now understood. It is possible that from the volunteers’ and theextraterrestrials’ perspective, they have come to change the course of their‘past’ to avoid some sort of catastrophe unfolding in their ‘present’. Maybeeven Atlantis happened in another time-space dimension of the Earth and not thisone. Just a thought. Now please excuse me while I disappear up my own backside!There have been memorable group incarnations of volunteers to bring higherfrequencies to the planet and to diffuse the negative vibrations. One of thesegroup incarnations came 2,000 years ago when the man, probably called Y’shua,was involved (as I explore at length in The Robots’ Rebellion).I believe that consciousness came from the future too, and that it is back onEarth today. If you look at the prophecies of many people and texts like thoseof Nostradamus, parts of the Bible, the Mayans of Central America, the NativeAmericans, and so many others throughout history, they all have a common theme:a period of fantastic change when a new world and a new Earth will emerge. Somebelieve this will happen in this decade and across the millennium into the nextcentury. Another common theme between such predictions, I believe, are that theywere channelled to this reality from frequencies outside the prison where theknowledge of what will occur is available to us.There are two main reasons, I feel, why all the predictions have pointed to thelast years of the 1990s and beyond. These relate to astrology and somethingcalled the Photon Belt or Beam. There are, according to astrologers, a number ofrare planetary alignments and sequences in the latter period of the 1990s whichare likely to trigger enormous change on all levels of people and planet – atransformation indeed of the old evolutionary cycle. The vibrations of theplanets affect us very powerfully. As the pull of the moon moves the tides ofwhole oceans, so our bodies are affected by the same spiritual magnetism. Ourbodies consist overwhelmingly of water because they are like batteries, storingand processing energy. Blood is the physical version of our energy meridians andblood is subject to influence by the planets, as is our body in general. Somehighly significant astrological events have already occurred like theUranus-Neptune alignments in 1993 and the effects of Pluto in 1995 which arespeeding the awakening of those who are ready. The year 2000 coincides with thehighest point of the upwards cycle of the Orion constellation to which thepyramid builders apparently aligned their geometry, and it was in the 11thmillennium BC, within the window period suggested for great geological upheavalson the Earth, that Orion reached the lowest point of its cycle. Astrologicalevents affect earthquakes and weather systems because of the vibrational changethey create on Earth, as does collective human thought. Also on May 5th 2000,the sun and the planets, Neptune, Uranus, Venus, Mercury, and Mars all alignwith each other. The vibrational effects of this are likely to be fantastic.Another important date may well be December 21st 2012, when the calender systemleft by the Mayans in Central America more than 1600 years ago, predicted that agreat cycle for the Earth would end. It appears to me that May 5th 2000 is themoment when the freedom vibration begins to take over from the fear vibration asthe dominant force in the human psyche as Uranus, the planet of breakthroughs,discovery, rebellion, freedom, and experimentation, enters into a colossalvibratory tussle in the heavens with Saturn, the planet of tradition, oldvalues, limitation, discipline, rules, regulations, and control. The giftedBritish astrologer, Gloria Treloar,1 says of this event:> “When these two planets challenge each other it signals a change in mass> consciousness. Events and circumstances during this transit will start to> shatter false ‘security’ which has been fixed in old social values and belief> systems promoted through fear. Experimenting with new concepts which give a> greater sense of liberty and independence has been the bottom line since the> sixties felt the first vibration of the Age of Aquarius. Rebels with a cause> emerged to fight injustice, narrow vision, and controlling influences. It was> a rehearsal for the final decade of the century when breakthroughs (Uranus)> would begin to happen on an aggregate level, rather than a generational one.> The effect will manifest in disruption and it is meant to – only through chaos> can creative and harmonic change emerge!”[../Images/00015.jpg]Figure 17Underpinning these astrological events in this period is the Photon Belt. Manypsychics and esoteric scientists are now agreed on the existence of a belt ofhighly charged energy centred on the Pleiades star system, an estimated 500light years from the Earth. It is from here that much channelled informationwhich feels right to me is purported to come. I believe that the Pleiades (maybein our ‘future’) is a base for the positive extraterrestrial support we arebeing given at this time, and quite possibly the home of extraterrestrials whohave abused the Earth and humanity, too. As with the Earth, the Pleiades willhave those of positive and negative intent. It is no coincidence, either, thatthe Pleiades was the focus of much mythology in the ancient civilisations ofGreece, China, and others. The astronomer, José Comas Sola, made a special studyof the Pleiades – the “Seven Sisters” as they are called – and he suggested thatthey form a system which includes our Sun and a number of others. Each Sun, hesaid, had its own planetary system. In his study of the star system, Paul OttoHesse claimed to have discovered a belt of immensely powerful energy which hetermed the Photon Belt. According to estimates, it takes this solar system24,000 (some say 26,000) years to orbit the Pleiades and the star reckoned to beat the centre of the belt (Figure 17) known as Alcyone (Al-see-ah-nee). Again,there is much ancient legend across many cultures about this star. It wouldappear that we have reached the point where this solar system is entering thePhoton Belt and its highly, highly, charged energy. The influence of the belt onthe Earth began in the early 1960s and affected the thinking of many people, butit was as nothing compared with what will happen over the next 35 years. Whileit takes 2,000 years to pass fully through the belt, the biggest impact is whenwe first enter, and the vibrations and molecular structure of everything has tocope with dramatically changing conditions. This will affect the thinking,behaviour, and physical bodies of all lifeforms.We are now beginning to see the mainstream scientific community confirmingphenomena long predicted by psychics and felt instinctively by sensitive people.Cosmic rays of (in modern times) unprecedented power are being detected.Normally the rays are measured in millions of electron volts, but scientists atthe Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, have measured cosmic rays with an energy of320 billion, billion electron volts. This had previously been considered“impossible”. Something similar has also been measured by scientists in Japan.Roger Highfield, the Science Editor of the London Daily Telegraph wrote:> “Something out there – no-one knows what – is hurling high energy particles> around the universe, in this case the most energetic ever observed by> scientists…Not even the power released by the most violent exploding stars> could account for them. Indeed conventional theory says such particles should> not exist…” 2These are the energies that are changing life on this planet by the minute,never mind the day, and these same energies are rebalancing the FourthDimension, so dispersing the negativity and manipulation from there. The GlobalElite are losing their power source. I was also fascinated to see how the cyclesof sunspots synchronise so remarkably with the cycles of the Earth’s evolutionleft by the ancient Maya of central America. Sunspots are produced when the sunis emitting an immensely powerful magnetism which comes to the Earth on the socalled solar wind.3 These cycles are fundamental, I believe, to the spiritualtransformation and the multidimensional shifts which the planet, and humanity,are experiencing. We are going through enormous magnetic change and this hasgreat consequences for the electronics and computer systems which, of course,are the basis of the world financial system.On Earth today in this period of incredible opportunity are millions ofvolunteers from many universal civilisations and time-space realities who havecome here to be at the front of the snowplough. Some are former Lemurian andAtlantean consciousnesses, and others who have come into the prison since then.But what has happened in the past is of no relevance now, except in theexperiences and the knowledge that has been gleaned to make the task easier. Itdoesn’t matter if your consciousness has been an Atlantean or a cabin boy in aprevious life, you are the sum total of all your experiences and it is what youdo now that matters. The volunteers on Earth today have been living what wewould call ‘normal’ lives, mostly with no idea what they are really here for orwhere they have come from. This has been essential to become knowledgeable andgrounded in the world as it is, and to lock into the rigid thought patterns theyhave come to challenge. Experiences, many extreme and sometimes very negative onthe surface, have been attracted to them to help their minds break out of theprogramming of this world and to access their higher consciousness. Often it iswhen you are as low as you can go that you shed the old, programmed skin andreveal the new one, the real you, underneath. As a channelled message said:“Opportunity is often disguised as a loss”.4 This happened to me in 1991, whenthe fantastic ridicule I attracted from virtually the entire United Kingdomallowed me to let go of the old perceptions and the concern of what othersthought of me. I entered another reality in which being true to myself and myheart became far more important than worrying what anyone would think of me. Ican’t recommend it highly enough.Within the subtle levels of the volunteers were preprogrammed spiritual ‘alarmclocks’ which have been activated increasingly since the late 1980s. They havesuddenly opened their eyes to another understanding and they are now creatinganother reality. Some have been in the financial world, or business, religion,education, and medicine. Others have been mothers at home, unemployed people, orthose who have retired. Their background and role in life up to this pointmatters only as experience. The real reason for this incarnation is justbeginning for most of them and their numbers gather by the day as more wake upand realise who they are. They are reconnecting across the jamming vibration towholeness and their lives and perceptions are changing dramatically. They areremembering. The same opportunity is available to everyone on the planet. In theyears to come, the masks will be removed. We are going to see how many spiritualvolunteers there are within the system of control. As they awaken, they willbring down these Elite bastions from within. At the same time, we will see thatmany of those who have spoken the words of the New Age, the environmental, andthe ‘radical’, are in fact tuned to a rather less pleasant consciousness. Bytheir deeds we shall recognise them, not by their words.The process of diffusing and removing the jamming frequency is very simple inone way, but, in this misguided world, it can involve some vast emotional andspiritual upheavals in our lives to deprogramme us to the point where we canachieve it. As people awaken and let go of the programming, their consciousnessalso lets go of that programming’s vibratory suppression which is holding downtheir own frequency. When the mind and feeling centres are opened and allowed toexpand, their frequency rises and if this is allowed to continue, it will reachthe point where it can synchronise with frequencies of reality outside thevibratory prison. This allows these higher frequencies to be filtered down ourlevels of being to this conscious level, and then broadcast out into thisphysical world. When this state of being is achieved, those people becomewalking, talking, transmitters of a higher frequency. The more people who awakento do this, the more the cumulative effect is raising the frequency of theplanet as a whole. This is allowing non-physical frequencies within the prisonto rise, because in some way, this dense physical level will hold back theothers if it doesn’t shift and raise itself. It acts like a drag or an anchor onthe other frequencies within the prison and until this dense physical levelmoves, they can’t.We are looking here at a multidimensional shift across many parallel universesin this period of transformation and not just on this single planet. When thismultidimensional shift happens, largely as a result of what we do on Earth nowin conjunction with the effect of the planets and the Photon Belt, the jammingfrequency will be overwhelmed and the prison door will fly open. We will be freeand whole again. The nightmare will be over. The jamming frequency is alreadydiffusing and breaking up, and light is pouring into our world. As the processgathers pace, the portals or gateways to other time-space realities (dimensions)are beginning to open. The period of quarantine is also coming to a close. Thesegateways, in places like Stonehenge, Machu Picchu in Peru, Tibet, Knossos inCrete, Ayers Rock, Lake Titicaca in the Andes, Mount Fuji, Mount Shasta, and thelands of ancient Sumer and Babylon (now Iraq) are opening as circumstancesallow. This is like opening a valve which allows energies and vibrations fromother dimensions to flood into this one.A merging of dimensions and realities is beginning to happen which is offeringthe opportunity for those who are ready, emotionally and mentally (vibrationallyin other words), to advance to a far higher state of consciousness, love,wisdom, and understanding. These energies and the effect of the Photon Belt areactivating data stored in our consciousness and our physical bodies. Knowledgeis being unlocked from the cells, bones, and our DNA which will, eventually, berestored to its twelve-stranded potential. This will return us to full braincapacity, instead of the 8 to 20% the human race works with currently. Each cellhas a consciousness and its coding is controlled by our thoughts. This is why wecan think ourselves ill and think ourselves healthy. Our emotions stimulate andrelease chemicals into our bodies which have positive and negative physicaleffects. Laughter is a great healer because of the chemicals it releases, andhatred, anger, fear, and guilt cause dis-ease for the same reason. Health isactually free and we will be able to regenerate our cells by our own thoughts.Our bodies age and become infirm because that is the reality programmed into thehuman mind and that is the reality we create. We don’t have to age in the waythat we do. Our thoughts ensure that we age, not our bodies. The power ofthought to heal the body is something the drug companies (Global Elite) don’twant us to know. Our bodies are going through incredible changes and this willincrease with each year.As the time-space portals reopen, more extraterrestrials will be visiting thisdimension and we will be seeing more UFO activity. An average of 150 UFOsightings a day are reported world wide and it is reckoned that only about onein ten sightings are actually reported. I would emphasise the caution, however,that the scientists and military of the Global Elite have flying saucer,anti-gravity technology and we need to be very careful not to be conned by itsuse in the guise of an “alien” threat to justify centralised control. I believethis to be a distinct possibility, the ground for which is being prepared. Thiswhole area of UFOs and extraterrestrials is a minefield which demands greatcaution and a very flexible mind. ETs, like everyone, can be positive andnegative in their intent, and it is vital that we don’t treat them as ‘gods’.They are not to be feared, because we will attract that reality, nor to beworshiped as saviours. We are our own saviours.There is a great deal of disinformation circulating about ETs and UFOs andpicking the wheat from the chaff requires a constantly open, but filtering,mind, and constant vigilance. The opening portals and merging of dimensions isbreaking the linear time locks which distinguish past, present, and future. Thatversion of time is collapsing and we will realise, amazing as it may seem, thatthe past, the present, and the future, are happening at the same time. Theeffect of collapsing linear time is that the hours and days will seem to passincredibly quickly until the point is reached when another version of timeemerges. These are difficult concepts to grasp because so much knowledge hasbeen kept from us and so much limited thinking has been imposed.Many people, more than ever before in modern times, are being attracted toancient sacred sites and most are unsure of exactly what is happening when theygo there and feel often powerful energies pass through them into the Earth. Theyknow something has happened because they can feel it and they know as morepeople awaken that the same experiences can be retold by millions around theworld. I was asking the same questions when it began to happen to me in 1990. Ibelieve that the energies we feel passing through us at such moments are thehigher frequencies filtering down our levels of being and we are grounding themon this frequency, so quickening its vibration. In 1987, hundreds of thousandsof people gathered at sacred sites all over the world for the event known asHarmonic Convergence when there was a mass grounding of higher frequencies ontothis level. This was the trigger that activated my own spiritual alarm clock andthe pace of awakening has increased in great leaps since then. This work ishelping the frequency of this physical level to raise itself out of themisunderstandings that have plagued this world.A frequency carries information, knowledge, and the higher the frequency, themore developed and evolved the knowledge. It is this frequency change that willtransform the world we live in because information is freedom. We talk offreedom of information, but it is the information itself which is the freedom.What we think is what we create and what we think is based on what we feel andknow – information, knowledge. As the frequency continues to rise, there is anexplosion of knowledge re-entering our world. Nothing and no-one will be thesame again. The true origin of the great sacred sites will be known, and sinceall spiritual change is reflected on the physical level, this is a period when aconstant stream of scientific, historical, and geological discoveries will bemade to overturn our whole view of history and who we are. There isworld-shattering information waiting to be found in Egypt, I am convinced. Inthe same way that the rising frequencies are triggering data and codes stored inour bodies, so it is happening with thought codings stored in the stones ofancient sites. The energies of these sites are filling with knowledge, which isavailable to anyone operating on a vibration high enough to access it.The higher frequencies can be filtered down and grounded anywhere and once youare connected with those higher levels, you are doing it all the time, oftenwithout even realising it. But there are points on the Earth’s surface – many ofwhich are marked by the standing stones and circles, mounds, hills, and otherplaces held sacred by the ancients – where this can be done most powerfully andeffectively. As acupuncture has long understood, the physical body is kept aliveby a web of energy lines known as meridians and these also connect into vortexpoints, the spirals of energy called chakras, where these lines cross. They arelike spinning spiral power stations on a grid of electricity lines. When theseenergies are flowing with balance and harmony, the person is physically,emotionally and mentally well. When they are imbalanced or blocked, they will besuffering from some form of physical, emotional, or mental dis-ease,dis-harmony.It is the same with the Earth. This energy grid of the Earth has been muchaffected by negative events and limitation of thought. The energy passingthrough these lines is a form of consciousness, because everything isconsciousness in different states of being. So these lines are affected by otherconsciousness – like the thoughts of human minds. When those thoughts are fullof fear, anxiety, guilt, pain, and other negative emotions, the negative thoughtpatterns are absorbed by the energy grid and its power and balance diminished.They are also carried around the globe on the grid network, and so the negativeenergy created by a war on one side of the world affects everyone because it ispassed around the planet. These lines are designed to enjoy positive-negativeand male-female harmony, but they have become dominated by the negative and maleenergies resulting from the inner turmoil and imbalances of humanity. In thistransition period, it is necessary to repair the grid by removing the negativeblockages, and channel high frequency energies into its system to raise thefrequency. Millions are now involved in this. Other levels of theirconsciousness are guiding them to the right place at the right time, via thefeeling centre and the magnetism. They are using their physical bodies astransformers and transmitters to broadcast the new frequency to this planet.The point of maximum impact on the jamming frequency is the collective mind ofhumanity. With every individual mind which opens itself and deprogrammes itsthinking, we are another step closer to that critical mass point of theHundredth Monkey Syndrome, when a big collective switch will occur. Those whoare working now to open their own consciousness and to heal and deprogrammethemselves, are at the front of the snowplough, the pioneers, who are adding tothat critical mass and making the big switch possible. If you are one of them,you have every right to be proud of yourself. Anyone can do it, anyone at all.You just make the choice, follow your heart at all times, and you are on yourway. If we now look at the Elite’s manipulation from the perspective I haveoutlined here, we can see that the themes of spiritual transformation, freedom,and global conspiracy are indivisible. We can also appreciate the wider picturewithin which the manipulation in this world needs to be seen if we are to fullyunderstand its nature:> > 1.

I passed on channelled information in earlier books goingback to 1990 which talked of dramatically changing weather patterns in thisdecade and beyond, with colossal rainfall and floods, and of many other extremeweather and geological phenomena. The changing weather patterns worldwide arenow obvious with enormous tracts of ice the size of countries breaking away fromthe polar ice shelves which were once considered permanent. Nothing is permanentexcept life itself. Rainfall records continue to be broken year after year; theseas rise, and rivers cover the land in ways that defy the eye. In other areasthere are great droughts. Look back at the ancient prophecies and you will findall of these things.We are told, often with little conviction, that this is the result of globalwarming, the Greenhouse Effect. I beg to differ. This is a diversion from whatis really happening, I believe. We are witnessing the result of the Photon Beltand the higher frequencies being grounded, the portals opening, and the movefrom a three-dimensional reality into the fourth and fifth dimensions.5 At thesame time, the old vibration seeks to hold on to its domain and this isreflected physically as those awakening and changing their thinking and theElite who wish to impose still further the old patterns of control anddomination. This is the tussle symbolised by Uranus and Saturn. This and thePhoton energies are stirring up the subtle levels of the planet consciousness –Mother Nature, Gaia, the Earth Spirit – and this is having magnetic consequencesin the Earth’s energy field. The planet is the physical body of a consciousnesswith a mind and emotions. The Earth is not just a physical sphere spinning inspace. She thinks and feels, just like we do. She is part of us, and we of her.The weather and geological changes are leading, I believe, to a switch of themagnetic poles and, possibly, a physical shift of the axis. How traumatic allthis has to be on the road to a better world is up to us, the human race. It isno coincidence that, looking at the records of insurance companies alone,geological and weather events have increased in both scale and number verysignificantly since the time of the Harmonic Convergence in 1987.This immense transformation we are living through is likely to be one ofextremes and opposites before all comes into harmony. It is the chaos period asone vibration breaks up and another moves in. Those with an open mind and heartwill absorb the new space-time realities. Others who follow the propaganda ofthe Global Elite and the Prison Warder consciousness will cling on to the oldvibration in their desperation to find security. They will become even morevehement in their religious, political, and economic dogma. They will resist therising vibrations if they choose that path, and this will have mental,emotional, and physical effects. The two states of being, the programmed mindand the open mind, will be more obvious with every month to those who know whatis happening. The Prison Warders, via the Global Elite, will increase theirefforts to speed the New World Order, but they will not ultimately succeed. Thistransition period may well stimulate many negative events, but if we raise ourown consciousness and hold onto our positive sense of self, we will not attractsuch events to us, unless, of course, it is part of our chosen path toexperience them. Our state of mind is our protection from harm. Astrologer,Gloria Treloar, told me:> “Uranus in square to Jupiter (May 5th 2000) signals a time of social and> economic change and a restructuring of values. Belief systems will be> transformed. Those already open to a different study of truth from the one> that has been indoctrinated down the years, will now take a further leap in> consciousness; those who have been on the sidelines, a little apprehensive> about even a small step, will suddenly cast aside their fears, take a look> outside themselves and move into that higher state – breakthrough! It won’t be> easy, but a happening so stunningly and refreshingly transformative can never> be described as a breeze. It’s a hurricane which roars through the psyche> uprooting old trees of knowledge and shaking foundations to make way for the> new. Although the transit of these planets will be uncomfortable, whatever the> individual and collective process experiences, it will eventually prove a> small price to pay for liberation.”If we follow our intuition, we will magnetically attract to ourselves everythingwe need to guide us through this period. Many people have said that my books,and others, have fallen at their feet from the shelf of a bookshop. This appearsto be a ‘mystery’, but it is not. The magnetic energy field of the book and theperson’s subconscious interact because the subconscious knows that its consciouslevel would benefit from reading the book. At its most powerful, this magneticattraction pulls the book from the shelf. It is like two magnets attracting eachother. If we are open minded, this process will ensure that we will be in theright place at the right time, with the right people, no matter what chaos maybe happening around us.In an ideal situation, the transition from one frequency to another is a verystraightforward process. But given the vibratory prison and the vast number ofclosed minds on the planet at this time, this is no ideal situation. The humanand Earth consciousness are not yet rising together as one. There are verydifferent minds linked to very different frequencies pulling in all directions.As I understand it, the dense physical level is one place where consciousnesseslinked to an infinite number of wavelengths can live together side by side inthe same world. The manufactured divisions which our generations have inheritedand perpetuated are the result of divided thought patterns. These patternsfighting for supremacy would cause some chaos anyway, but this is now happeningin a period in which much higher frequencies are becoming part of this realityalso, and raising the whole vibration of the Earth. The subtle energy levels ofthe planet have become subject to astonishing vibratory pressures and it isthese which are changing the weather so fundamentally. They will, if theycontinue to build, bring geological upheavals of a kind not experienced or evendreamed about in the modern world. There is so much evidence now emerging thatindicates massive changes in our environment. In the UK, the water tables inLondon, Birmingham and other cities are rising rapidly, some by two metres andmore per year. This has fundamental consequences for daily life.6Hard as it may be to accept at first, the geological and weather catastrophesare created largely by the human mind and the wavelengths it broadcasts. The waythe collective mind thinks affects the planetary mind, Gaia, and if she becomesimbalanced emotionally and mentally, this has physical effects, just as it doesin the human body. But such a scale of physical change does not have to be. Itis within our minds and hearts to make this transition far smoother than that.As more people deprogramme and allow their minds and hearts to open, they willcease to be part of the old vibration as they are able to connect with, andground, the higher, freedom vibrations of love and harmony. The greater thenumber who step out of the old vibration and into the new, the smoother and moreharmonious the transition will be. But whatever happens, the years of thevibratory prison are almost over. The only question left is how bumpy will beits last days, and if we are to lessen that impact, the time for action isurgent.So, as always, the answers lie with us. If we can heal ourselves and stop beingmanipulated by the Prison Warder consciousness, via the Global Elite, the wholeprocess will be easier and the end of the jamming frequency will be hastened. Ifwe heal ourselves, open ourselves, and trust ourselves, we will heal each otherand we will heal the world.

Dispersing the smokescreens is a life’s work. I come from the directionof no religious, racial, or political dogma. I only wish to challenge theimposition of belief systems by those who use violence, fear, guilt, and thesuppression of information. I also desire for love to flood this planet and forall humanity to access its full and infinite potential. If anyone decides totake parts of this book out of context and pronounce it ‘racist’, they will bemaking a statement about their own state of being, not mine. I wouldn’t know howto be racist if my life depended upon it.I seek freedom for myself, for humanity, and for this planet and all herlifeforms. If there are those who believe, or claim to believe, otherwise, thatis their right. But I know what is in my heart and that is good enough for me.Such people will benefit, too, from remembering that their children andgrandchildren, of whatever colour, culture, or background, will have to live inthe world we leave them. Would they prefer us to leave them freedom or the NewWorld Order? To be accused of racism when you have love and freedom in yourheart can be frustrating, but no scale of criticism will stop me. It is time forhumanity to stop running away. Time to let go of fear.You will have noted, I’m sure, how the first section of the book is far longerthan the second. This is not an imbalance. It is symbolic of how simple theanswers are to all that I have outlined in this book. The principles withinthese last few chapters contain all that we need to change the reality of thisworld. We need to love, respect, and forgive ourselves and, through that, love,respect and forgive everyone else. One will come with the other. It begins withself. I don’t have to set out new economic and political structures and tellpeople how they must live to create a better society. Who the hell am I to tellsomeone else what they should do, anyway? I know what is right for me, not you.From the transformation of mind which love, respect, and forgiveness of selfwill trigger, all these other answers will naturally evolve. We have thetyrannical structures of today because that is the reality the collective mindhas created by its attitude to itself. When we change that attitude, we changethe world. The pyramid becomes a circle. The human race, in general, doesn’tlike itself, let alone love itself. That is reflected in the physical reality.When love abounds within us, love will wrap its arms around the planet and it ison that foundation that all else will follow.LoveBy love, I mean a much greater love than the emotional attachment and possessionthat so much ‘love’ on Earth has become. I don’t mean “I love you if I fancyyou, darling”. Nor “I love you if what you do is acceptable to me, or if youconform to my idea of someone who deserves to be loved”.I mean “I love you, whatever you do”. It means to read this book and then say: Ilove you, Dr Kissinger. I love you David Rockefeller, George Bush and BillClinton. That kind of love. Without condition or possession. It is the love wehave for our children. We don’t always agree with what they do and say, but welove them just the same.If we can see each other in that light, the ills of this planet will fade away.With this unconditional love for self and each other, we would not produceeconomic arguments for why homeless people must sleep in the streets. Theeconomic system would become subordinate to love and reflect that love. The ideathat we would allow one person to be without adequate shelter would beunthinkable. We would stop charging interest on money, remove the debt so faraccumulated, and spend what was necessary, interest free, to build enough goodquality homes for people to live in. The love in our hearts would accept nothingless. We would dismantle the economic tyranny and encourage communities to takeback the power over their lives, providing what is necessary for the benefit ofpeople, not some Global Elite. Love would eliminate the pain and suffering weimpose on the animal kingdom. We would recognise that the privileged minority onthis planet cannot, with love, go on living off the backs of the Third World andthen ease their conscience by putting a few pounds in a charity tin here andthere. Love would insist that we withdraw from such economic dictatorship andallow those oppressed billions to live their lives for the benefit of themselvesand not the multinational corporations. There would be no more CIA fascist coupsto thwart elected governments determined to serve the needs of the people whenlove abounds in the collective human heart.Love would cease to cooperate with the present structures of global power and indoing so, it would show just how little power they really have. They only existbecause we created them and because we continue to cooperate and bow to theirwill. The real power in a pyramid lies at the base, not the top. Nothingsurvives if it is not founded on love and the present structures of control willnot survive. The governments we select in a world of love would reflect thatdesire to serve, to set free, and not impose. How many people today vote withlove in their hearts? People vote, overwhelmingly, for what they believe isbest, materially, for them in the short-term. That is the reality they create –governments which serve themselves, short-term self-interest, and not theinterests of others. We get what we vote for, because we get what we are feelingin our hearts when we, collectively, decide how to vote.If the human race voted out of love, it would attract and elect such people intogovernment. It is no good hurling all the blame at politicians for what ishappening in the world. Politicians can only get elected by telling people whatthey have been programmed to want to hear. What people want to hear is what isin it, materially, for them. The kind of politicians we elect are an exactreflection of the collective attitudes which voted for them. When the collectivehuman mind changes, so will the kind of politician we elect. Try getting electedon a policy of ending the Western dictatorship of the Third World which wouldaffect the incomes and imports of the industrialised countries. No chance. Onlywith love in the collective heart will that be possible. Power to the peoplewith the power of love.Love for self will transform our lives, not least in the way we heal ourselvesand others. Today, the medical services are controlled by the multinational drugcompanies. Sixty per cent of the US drug industry is owned by the Rockefellersalone. As a result, what claims to be state-of-the-art ‘medicine’ offers thescalpel or the drug in response to almost every ill. Both are motivated, attheir controlling levels, by profit, not people. Wealth and not health. Theinfinite knowledge of healing in the world which understands how imbalances inour eternal selves create physical dis-ease is kept out of ‘official’ medicine.The body-as-machine approach of Darwin and others is still the one taught inmedical schools and hospitals. It has become so farcical, that a hospital doctorI once met treats the nurses with homeopathy, but cannot treat his patients inthat way, except secretly, because the wrath of the officialdrug-company-controlled medical establishment would be brought down upon him.Millions die of cancer while many cures are suppressed. If you can’t sell it ata vast profit under contract to a drug company, every effort is made to destroymethods of healing that would remove the so called “incurable” diseases oftoday. There are no incurable diseases. Every one is caused by an energyimbalance – an imbalance that can be returned to harmony and, in doing so, thebody returned to health. This is happening every day outside the medicalestablishment.Love for self will insist on taking back power over our own bodies. The drugcompanies dominate because the human race has, largely, handed over control ofthe body to doctors and pharmacists. It is an expression, yet again, of the wayhumans look outside themselves for answers. We look outside for confirmationthat we are ok; for someone else to blame when something goes wrong; and for theanswers to our discomfort when our body is ill. The answers for all three areinside us, in our view of ourselves. Self-hatred and frustration leads to cancerand heart disease, and every other ill can be linked to a mental, emotional, orspiritual imbalance, all of which can be corrected. I can thoroughly recommend abook called You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay1 for more detail about this. Aswe begin to love ourselves and let go of the fears, guilts, and resentmentsaccumulated over the years and the aeons of time, disease in the world willplummet. The cause of it will have diminished. We will see the illness that doesoccur as a sign of something amiss inside us. We will then address that, andthink ourselves well again. Our physical dis-ease is also the result of ourinner dis-ease, the magnetic pattern our thoughts create.Love is not just a word. It is the power that holds creation together. It is thepower that holds us together and, as we can see, whenever love is missing, alife, or a world, simply falls apart.RespectThis, together with love, is the self-balancing mechanism of any balancedsociety. An imbalanced society creates endless rules and regulations to say “youwill” and “you won’t” to overcome the lack of respect. When you have respect forthe Earth, you don’t need laws and government agencies to tell you not to damageor pollute the environment. You would not dream of doing so. When you respectlife as sacred, you don’t need laws against cruelty to animals because you wouldnot dream of harming a fellow expression of creation. When you respect another’sright to live their life as he or she sees fit, you don’t seek to impose yourview on them. You respect and celebrate their right to be different. Not wrong.Different. When such respect is awash in the collective human mind, people willbe living their lives in a way they believe to be right, while allowing othersto do the same. All will shape their behaviour so they do not impose theirthinking upon another. There will be no need for laws as we know them todaybecause love and respect will be the balance that allows different beliefs tolive in harmony.This respect for others comes, as always, from respect for self. A lack ofrespect for others is the outward expression of a diminished respect for self.When we respect ourselves, we stop looking to others to tell us what to do andthink. We have respect for our own infinite capacity to decide what we can do inany situation. We might seek another’s advice and view, but in the endself-respect decides for itself. Self-respect also has the confidence to goagainst the majority view when appropriate and to decide its own morals andvalues. It refuses to bow to all the “shoulds” and “musts” that we are subjectedto, and subject ourselves to, from the earliest years of childhood, most of theminherited from previous generations, sometimes thousands of years before. Youmust do this, you should do that, I must do this, I must do that. Who says? TheAmerican therapist, Albert Ellis, called this phenomenon “mustabation”. Themusts certainly abate in the face of self respect. Love and respect for self arethe most powerful combination in Creation. With them as our guiding light, therecan be no fear, or guilt, or psychological fascism. And without those, there isno New World Order.ForgivenessThe burden of guilt carried by the human race, much of it going back to previouslives, is caused by a refusal to forgive ourselves. If we do not forgiveourselves, we find it so much harder to forgive others. If we don’t forgiveothers, we eat ourselves away with resentment, and seek revenge against those weconsider to have acted badly towards us. Hence we have the conflicts and feudsthat span the generations and the inherited prejudice and divisions which theGlobal Elite so exploit. If we vent our anger and resentment on the people Ihave named in this book, some of whom will not know what they are reallyinvolved in, what good will that do? It is right that we know what is going onand those who are seeking to control us. Without that knowledge, we will go onbeing manipulated. But the people connected with the New World Order do not needor deserve our hatred. No-one does. They are victims, too, the physical resultof the emotional and spiritual imbalances within them which desire to controland dominate others. The last thing they need is more hatred. They need ourlove. By that, I don’t mean a love that walks away and allows all this tocontinue unchallenged. I mean a love that does challenge the imposition, butwithout hatred or a desire for revenge.I love you, I love you, I love you, Dr Kissinger. I am you and you are me. Weare each other. But I will challenge the New World Order mentality until themoment it is time for me to leave this planet and move on. The two approaches,the love and the challenge, are not incompatible. Nor is forgiveness of thepersonnel while working to expose their game plan.Forgiveness of self and each other will bring an end to the story I have told.Let the divisions between us fall away, for they have been manufactured on theclassic principle of divide and rule. That is the reason behind the engineeredwars and the divisions of race, colour, country, class and income bracket. Whilethere is an us and a them, we are a manipulator’s party trick. When the us andthem becomes we, which is what we really are, all part of each other, themanipulation will end. Let us put our arms around each other, the Arab and theJew, the Christian and the Muslim, the manipulator and the manipulated. It’sbeen a nightmare, but the nightmare is almost over. It’s time to dream.You are a beautiful spirit. You can be whatever you want to be. You are uniqueand you are loved in a way that we find so hard to comprehend on this planet.There are times when I feel that love from all, and for all, of Creation. It isa love without fear, guilt, resentment, judgement or division. It is anexperience beyond words and it is ours, yours, for the taking, the thinking, thefeeling. We’ve been away too long, my friends. It is time to go home andreconnect with all that is. In the words of a lovely song recorded for the ComicRelief Appeal:> > > When we stand together,> > > It’s our finest hour.> > > We can do anything, anything, anything, anything,> > > Keep believing in love’s power.> > > Love can build a bridge,> > > Between your heart and mine,> > > Love can build a bridge,> > > Don’t you think it’s time?2There are gathering millions who are screaming “YES!” to that question. As love,respect, and forgiveness sweep across the human mind and we love out ofexistence the misunderstandings of the past, we are destined to be the firstgenerations for thousands of years who will leave our children a better worldthan the one we found. That is our gift to, and from, this glorious planet.My fellow expressions of God, what a great time to be alive.> SOURCES> > > 1 Louise Hay, You Can Heal Your Life (Eden Grove, London, 1988).

As I walked up thestairs into the arena, I met a friend who was looking worried and bemused. Whatwas the problem? Seconds earlier she had heard a security guard say to someonethat the security seats were in row S, numbers 25, 26, 27 and 28. I couldunderstand why she was confused. She knew from an earlier conversation that thetickets I had for myself and another friend, Ayem, were row S, numbers 25 and26! What goes on?We went to the seats to see what would happen and as we sat down all the headswere turning to the back of the arena. Someone was arriving, surrounded by‘heavies’, amid an explosion of flashing cameras. My friend then came over andsolved the mystery. “It’s Jimmy Carter” she said. “What?” At that moment, JimmyCarter, the first Trilateral Commission President of the United States, walkedalong my row and sat down with his wife…next to me! I shook his hand as hearrived. “Good evening, Mr President.” I just about resisted the temptation toenquire about the health of David Rockefeller. Here was I, a man who had exposedCarter in The Robots’ Rebellion and even more so in this book, now sitting nextto him surrounded by CIA guards. I laughed till I cried. What really struck mewas that the energy working through those genuinely committed to the spiritualtransformation is so strong that the New World Order has no chance of success.Mr Rockefeller, Dr Kissinger, Mr Carter et al, it’s over my friends. I couldhave been allocated any seat among the three and a half thousand in the arena. Icould have gone to any performance of the show over more than a year. But Ayemand I were there on that night sitting next to that man. Incredible.During the performance I said to Ayem that I felt I was taking energy fromCarter’s aura. I didn’t know exactly what it was, but there was definitely aflow from him to me. By the end of the show I was feeling a little agitated andlater I was seriously agitated. In the end I was writhing around on the bedscreaming and growling like some crazed animal. Two friends, including Ayem,kneeled beside me projecting love towards me. One level of my consciousness wasin total control because I knew what was happening. For maybe 15 to 20 minutes,I was experiencing the consciousness that controls the world and has done so forthousands of years. Its malevolence, hatred, arrogance, anger and lack ofpositive emotion was utterly stunning. When I felt I had experienced enough, Iopened my heart energy (love) and in seconds the Prison Warder Consciousness wasgone. I learned two things from that experience. Firstly, the Prison WarderConsciousness has no control over love, and secondly, the personalities behindthe New World Order over thousands of years have been possessed by thismalevolence. So were the Nazis. I could clearly understand why they have actedin the ways they have throughout history.Lying there, feeling the grotesque emotions of the Prison Warder Consciousness,the following words came so powerfully into my mind…Forgive them, they know not what they do."},{"pageContent":"bibliographyThis is a list of the books you may wish to consult for more detailedinformation of specific subject areas.
