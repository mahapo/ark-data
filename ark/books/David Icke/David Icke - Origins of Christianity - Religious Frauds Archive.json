In the West particularly, sizable tomes have been composed speculating upon the nature and historical background of the main character of Western religions, Jesus Christ. Many have tried to dig into the precious few clues as to Jesus's identity and come up with a biographical sketch that either bolsters faith or reveals a more human side of this godman to which we can all relate. Obviously, considering the time and energy spent on them, the subjects of Christianity and its legendary founder are very important to the Western mind and culture. The Controversy http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (1 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive Despite all of this literature continuously being cranked out and the significance of the issue, in the public at large there is a serious lack of formal and broad education regarding religion and mythology, and most individuals are highly uninformed in this area. Concerning the issue of Christianity, for example, the majority of people are taught in most schools and churches that Jesus Christ was an actual historical figure and that the only controversy regarding him is that some people accept him as the Son of God and the Messiah, while others do not. However, whereas this is the raging debate most evident in this field today, it is not the most important. Shocking as it may seem to the general populace, the most enduring and profound controversy in this subject is whether or not a person named Jesus Christ ever really existed . Although this debate may not be evident from publications readily found in popular bookstores 1 , when one examines this issue closely, one will find a tremendous volume of literature that demonstrates, logically and intelligently, time and again that Jesus Christ is a mythological character along the same lines as the Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Sumerian, Phoenician, Indian or other godmen, who are all presently accepted as myths rather than historical figures 2 . Delving deeply into this large body of work, one uncovers evidence that the Jesus character is based upon much older myths and heroes from around the globe. One discovers that this story is not, therefore, a historical representation of a Jewish rebel carpenter who had physical incarnation in the Levant 2,000 years ago. In other words, it has been demonstrated continually for centuries that this character, Jesus Christ, was invented and did not depict a real person who was either the \"son of God\" or was \"evemeristically\" made into a superhuman by enthusiastic followers 3 .

As Rev. Robert Taylor says, \"And from the apostolic age downwards, in a never interrupted succession, but never so strongly and emphatically as in the most primitive times, was the existence of Christ as a man most strenuously denied.\" 5 Emperor Julian, who, coming after the reign of the fanatical and murderous \"good Christian\" Constantine, returned rights to pagan worshippers, stated, \"If anyone should wish to know the truth with respect to you Christians, he will find your impiety to be made up partly of the Jewish audacity, and partly of the indifference and confusion of the Gentiles, and that you have put together not the best, but the worst characteristics of them both.\" 6 According to these learned dissenters, the New Testament could rightly be called, \"Gospel Fictions.\" 7 A century ago, mythicist Albert Churchward said, \"The canonical gospels can be shown to be a collection of sayings from the Egyptian Mythos and Eschatology.\" 8 In Forgery in Christianity , Joseph Wheless states, \"The gospels are all priestly forgeries over a century after their pretended dates.\" 9 Those who concocted some of the hundreds of \"alternative\" gospels and epistles that were being kicked about during the first several centuries C.E. have even admitted that they had forged the documents. 10 Forgery during the first centuries of the Church's existence was admittedly rampant, so common in fact that a new phrase was coined to describe it: \"pious fraud.\" 11 Such prevarication is confessed to repeatedly in the Catholic Encyclopedia. 12 Some of the \"great\" church fathers, such as Eusebius 13 , were determined by their own peers to be unbelievable liars who regularly wrote their own fictions of what \"the Lord\" said and did during \"his\" http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (3 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive alleged sojourn upon the earth. 14 The Proof The assertion that Jesus Christ is a myth can be proved not only through the works of dissenters and \"pagans\" who knew the truth - and who were viciously refuted or murdered for their battle against the Christian priests and \"Church Fathers\" fooling the masses with their fictions - but also through the very statements of the Christians themselves, who continuously disclose that they knew Jesus Christ was a myth founded upon more ancient deities located throughout the known ancient world. In fact, Pope Leo X, privy to the truth because of his high rank, made this curious declaration, \"What profit has not that fable of Christ brought us!\" 15 (Emphasis added.) As Wheless says, \"The proofs of my indictment are marvellously easy.\" The Gnostics From their own admissions, the early Christians were incessantly under criticism by scholars of great repute who were impugned as \"heathens\" by their Christian adversaries. This group included many Gnostics, who strenuously objected to the carnalization of their deity, as the Christians can be shown to have taken many of the characteristics of their god and godman from the Gnostics, meaning \"Ones who know,\" a loose designation applied to members of a variety of esoteric schools and brotherhoods. The refutations of the Christians against the Gnostics reveal that the Christian godman was an insult to the Gnostics, who held that their god could never take human form. 16 Biblical Sources It is very telling that the earliest Christian documents, the Epistles attributed to \"Paul,\" never discuss a historical http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (4 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive background of Jesus but deal exclusively with a spiritual being who was known to all gnostic sects for hundreds to thousands of years. The few \"historical\" references to an actual life of Jesus cited in the Epistles are demonstrably interpolations and forgeries, as are, according to Wheless, the Epistles themselves, as they were not written by \"Paul.\" 17 Aside from the brief reference to Pontius Pilate at 1 Timothy 6:13, an epistle dated ben Yehoshua to 144 CE and thus not written by Paul, the Pauline literature (as pointed out by Edouard Dujardin) \"does not refer to Pilate 18 , or the Romans, or Caiaphas, or the Sanhedrin, or Herod 19 , or Judas, or the holy women, or any person in the gospel account of the Passion, and that it also never makes any allusion to them; lastly, that it mentions absolutely none of the events of the Passion, either directly or by way of allusion.\" 20 Dujardin additionally relates that other early \"Christian\" writings such as Revelation do not mention any historical details or drama. 21 Mangasarian notes that Paul also never quotes from Jesus's purported sermons and speeches, parables and prayers, nor does he mention Jesus's supernatural birth or any of his alleged wonders and miracles, all which one would presume would be very important to his followers, had such exploits and sayings been known prior to \"Paul.\" 22 Turning to the gospels themselves, which were composed between 170-180 C.E. 22a , their pretended authors, the apostles, give sparse histories and genealogies of Jesus that contradict each other and themselves in numerous places. The birthdate of Jesus is depicted as having taken place at different times. His birth and childhood are not mentioned in \"Mark,\" and although he is claimed in \"Matthew\" and \"Luke\" to have been \"born of a virgin,\" his lineage is traced to the House of David through Joseph, such that he may \"fulfill prophecy.\" 23 He is said in the first three (Synoptic) gospels to have taught for one year before he died, while in \"John\" the number is three years. \"Matthew\" relates that Jesus delivered \"The Sermon on http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (5 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive the Mount\" 24 before \"the multitudes,\" while \"Luke\" says it was a private talk given only to the disciples. The accounts of his Passion and Resurrection differ utterly from each other, and no one states how old he was when he died. 25 Wheless says, \"The so-called 'canonical' books of the New Testament, as of the Old, are a mess of contradictions and confusions of text, to the present estimate of 150,000 and more 'variant readings,' as is well known and admitted.\" 26 In addition, of the dozens of gospels, ones that were once considered canonical or genuine were later rejected as \"apocryphal\" or spurious, and vice versa. So much for the \"infallible Word of God\" and \"infallible\" Church! The confusion exists because the Christian plagiarists over the centuries were attempting to amalgamate and fuse practically every myth, fairytale, legend, doctrine or bit of wisdom they could pilfer from the innumerable different mystery religions and philosophies that existed at the time. In doing so, they forged, interpolated, mutilated, changed, and rewrote these texts for centuries. 27 Non-Biblical Sources Basically, there are no non-biblical references to a historical Jesus by any known historian of the time during and after Jesus's purported advent. Walker says, \"No literate person of his own time mentioned him in any known writing.\" Eminent Hellenistic Jewish historian and philosopher Philo (20 B.C.E.-50 C.E.), alive at the purported time of Jesus, makes no mention of him. Nor do any of the some 40 other historians who wrote during the first one to two centuries of the Common Era. \"Enough of the writings of [these] authors . . . remain to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.\" 28 Their silence is deafening testimony against the historicizers. http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (6 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive In the entire works of the Jewish historian Josephus, which constitute many volumes, there are only two paragraphs that purport to refer to Jesus. Although much has been made of these \"references,\" they have been dismissed by all scholars and even by Christian apologists as forgeries, as have been those referring to John the Baptist and James, \"brother\" of Jesus. Bishop Warburton labeled the Josephus interpolation regarding Jesus as \"a rank forgery, and a very stupid one, too.\" 29 Wheless notes that, \"The first mention ever made of this passage, and its text, are in the Church History of that 'very dishonest writer,' Bishop Eusebius, in the fourth century. . . CE [Catholic Encyclopedia] admits . . . the above cited passage was not known to Origen and the earlier patristic writers .\" Wheless, a lawyer, and Taylor, a minister, agree that it was Eusebius himself who forged the passage. Regarding the letter to Trajan supposedly written by Pliny the Younger, which is one of the pitifully few \"references\" to Jesus or Christianity held up by Christians as evidence of the existence of Jesus, there is but one word that is applicable - \"Christian\" - and that has been demonstrated to be spurious, as is also suspected of the entire letter. Concerning the passage in the works of the historian Tacitus, who did not live during the purported time of Jesus but was born two decades after his purported death, this is also considered by competent scholars as an interpolation and forgery. 30 Christian defenders also like to hold up the passage in Suetonius that refers to someone named \"Chrestus\" or \"Chresto\" as reference to their Savior; however, while some have speculated that there was a Roman man of that name at that time, the name \"Chrestus\" or \"Chrestos,\" meaning \"useful,\" was frequently held by freed slaves. Others opine that this passage is also an interpolation.

He will go over the usual citation of the historians who mention Jesus and the letters claiming to have been written about him. When the credulous questioner, putting trust in the intelligence and good faith of his pastor, gets this answer, he goes away assured on the point of the veracity of the Gospel story. The pastor does not qualify his data with the information that the practice of forgery, fictionizing and fable was rampant in the early Church. In the simple interest of truth, then, it is important to examine the body of alleged testimony from secular history and see what credibility and authority it possess. \"First, as to the historians whose works record the existence of Jesus, the list comprises but four. They are Pliny, Tacitus, Suetonius and Josephus. There are short paragraphs in the works of each of these, two in Josephus. The total quantity of this material is given by Harry Elmer Barnes in The Twilight of Christianity as some twenty-four lines. It may total a little more, perhaps twice that amount. This meager testimony constitutes the body or mass of the evidence of 'one of the best attested events in history.' Even if it could be accepted as indisputably authentic and reliable, it would be faltering support for an event that has dominated the thought of half the world for eighteen centuries. http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (8 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive \"But what is the standing of this witness? Not even Catholic scholars of importance have dissented from a general agreement of academic investigators that these passages, one and all, must by put down as forgeries and interpolations by partisan Christian scribes who wished zealously to array the authority of these historians behind the historicity of the Gospel life of Jesus. A sum total of forty or fifty lines from secular history supporting the existence of Jesus of Nazareth, and they completely discredited!\" 30a Of these \"references,\" Dujardin says, \"But even if they are authentic, and were derived from earlier sources, they would not carry us back earlier than the period in which the gospel legend took form, and so could attest only the legend of Jesus, and not his historicity.\" In any case, these scarce and brief \"references\" to a man who supposedly shook up the world can hardly be held up as proof of his existence, and it is absurd that the purported historicity of the entire Christian religion is founded upon them. 31 As it is said, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof\"; yet, no proof of any kind for the historicity of Jesus has ever existed or is forthcoming. The Characters It is evident that there was no single historical person upon whom the Christian religion was founded, and that \"Jesus Christ\" is a compilation of legends, heroes, gods and godmen. There is not adequate room here to go into detail about each god or godman that contributed to the formation of the Jewish Jesus character; suffice it to say that there is plenty of documentation to show that this issue is not a question of \"faith\" or \"belief.\" The truth is that during the era this character supposedly lived there was an extensive library at Alexandria and an incredibly http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (9 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive nimble brotherhood network that stretched from Europe to China, and this information network had access to numerous manuscripts that told the same narrative portrayed in the New Testament with different place names and ethnicity for the characters. In actuality, the legend of Jesus nearly identically parallels the story of Krishna, for example, even in detail, as was presented by noted mythologist and scholar Gerald Massey over 100 years ago, as well as by Rev. Robert Taylor 160 years ago, among others. 32 The Krishna tale as told in the Hindu Vedas has been dated to at least as far back as 1400 B.C. E. 33 The same can be said of the well-woven Horus mythos, which also is practically identical, in detail, to the Jesus story, but which predates the Christian version by thousands of years. The Jesus story incorporated elements from the tales of other deities recorded in this widespread area, such as many of the following world saviors and \"sons of God,\" most or all of whom predate the Christian myth, and a number of whom were crucified or executed. 33a m Adad of Assyria m Adonis, Apollo, Heracles (\"Hercules\") and Zeus of Greece m Alcides of Thebes m Attis of Phrygia m Baal of Phoenicia m Bali of Afghanistan m Beddru of Japan m Buddha of India m Crite of Chaldea m Deva Tat of Siam m Hesus of the Druids m Horus, Osiris, and Serapis of Egypt, whose long- haired, bearded appearance was adopted for the Christ character 34 m Indra of Tibet/India m Jao of Nepal http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (10 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive m Krishna of India m Mikado of the Sintoos m Mithra of Persia m Odin of the Scandinavians m Prometheus of Caucasus/Greece m Quetzalcoatl of Mexico m Salivahana of Bermuda m Tammuz of Syria (who was, in a typical mythmaking move, later turned into the disciple Thomas 35 ) m Thor of the Gauls m Universal Monarch of the Sibyls 36 m Wittoba of the Bilingonese m Xamolxis of Thrace m Zarathustra/Zoroaster of Persia m Zoar of the Bonzes The Major Players Buddha Although most people think of Buddha as being one person who lived around 500 B.C.E., the character commonly portrayed as Buddha can also be demonstrated to be a compilation of godmen, legends and sayings of various holy men both preceding and succeeding the period attributed to the Buddha. 37 The Buddha character has the following in common with the Christ figure: 38 m Buddha was born of the virgin Maya, who was considered the \"Queen of Heaven.\" 38aa m He was of royal descent. m He crushed a serpent's head. m He performed miracles and wonders, healed the sick, fed 500 men from a \"small basket of cakes,\" and walked on water. 38a m He abolished idolatry, was a \"sower of the word,\" and preached \"the establishment of a kingdom of http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (11 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive righteousness.\" 38b m He taught chastity, temperance, tolerance, compassion, love, and the equality of all. m He was transfigured on a mount. m Sakya Buddha was crucified in a sin-atonement, suffered for three days in hell, and was resurrected. 38c m He ascended to Nirvana or \"heaven.\" m Buddha was considered the \"Good Shepherd\" 39 , the \"Carpenter\" 40 , the \"Infinite and Everlasting.\" 40a m He was called the \"Savior of the World\" and the \"Light of the World.\" Horus of Egypt The stories of Jesus and Horus are very similar, with Horus even contributing the name of Jesus Christ. Horus and his once-and-future Father, Osiris, are frequently interchangeable in the mythos (\"I and my Father are one\"). 41 The legends of Horus go back thousands of years, and he shares the following in common with Jesus: m Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a cave/manger 42 , with his birth being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men. 43 m He was a child teacher in the Temple and was baptized when he was 30 years old. 44 m Horus was also baptized by \"Anup the Baptizer,\" who becomes \"John the Baptist.\" m He had 12 disciples. m He performed miracles and raised one man, El-Azar- us, from the dead. m He walked on water. m Horus was transfigured on the Mount. m He was crucified, buried in a tomb and resurrected. m He was also the \"Way, the Truth, the Light, the Messiah, God's Anointed Son, the Son of Man, the Good Shepherd, the Lamb of God, the Word\" etc. http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (12 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive m He was \"the Fisher,\" and was associated with the Lamb, Lion and Fish (\"Ichthys\"). 45 m Horus's personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever- becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" 46 m Horus was called \"the KRST,\" or \"Anointed One,\" long before the Christians duplicated the story. 47 In fact, in the catacombs at Rome are pictures of the baby Horus being held by the virgin mother Isis - the original \"Madonna and Child\" 48 - and the Vatican itself is built upon the papacy of Mithra 49 , who shares many qualities with Jesus and who existed as a deity long before the Jesus character was formalized. The Christian hierarchy is nearly identical to the Mithraic version it replaced 50 . Virtually all of the elements of the Catholic ritual, from miter to wafer to water to altar to doxology, are directly taken from earlier pagan mystery religions. 51 Mithra, Sungod of Persia The story of Mithra precedes the Christian fable by at least 600 years. According to Wheless, the cult of Mithra was, shortly before the Christian era, \"the most popular and widely spread 'Pagan' religion of the times.\" Mithra has the following in common with the Christ character: m Mithra was born of a virgin on December 25th. m He was considered a great traveling teacher and master. m He had 12 companions or disciples. m He performed miracles. m He was buried in a tomb. m After three days he rose again. m His resurrection was celebrated every year. m Mithra was called \"the Good Shepherd.\" m He was considered \"the Way, the Truth and the Light, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Messiah.\" m He was identified with both the Lion and the Lamb. m His sacred day was Sunday, \"the Lord's Day,\" http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (13 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive hundreds of years before the appearance of Christ. m Mithra had his principal festival on what was later to become Easter, at which time he was resurrected. m His religion had a Eucharist or \"Lord's Supper.\" 52 Krishna of India The similarities between the Christian character and the Indian messiah are many. Indeed, Massey finds over 100 similarities between the Hindu and Christian saviors, and Graves, who includes the various noncanonical gospels in his analysis, lists over 300 likenesses. It should be noted that a common earlier English spelling of Krishna was \"Christna,\" which reveals its relation to '\"Christ.\" It should also be noted that, like the Jewish godman, many people have believed in a historical, carnalized Krishna. 53 m Krishna was born of the Virgin Devaki (\"Divine One\") 53a m His father was a carpenter. 54 m His birth was attended by angels, wise men and shepherds, and he was presented with gold, frankincense and myrrh. 54a m He was persecuted by a tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of infants. 55 m He was of royal descent. m He was baptized in the River Ganges. 55a m He worked miracles and wonders. m He raised the dead and healed lepers, the deaf and the blind. m Krishna used parables to teach the people about charity and love. m \"He lived poor and he loved the poor.\" 56 m He was transfigured in front of his disciples. 57 m In some traditions he died on a tree or was crucified between two thieves. 58 m He rose from the dead and ascended to heaven. m Krishna is called the \"Shepherd God\" and \"Lord of lords,\" and was considered \"the Redeemer, http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (14 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive Firstborn, Sin Bearer, Liberator, Universal Word.\" 59 m He is the second person of the Trinity, 60 and proclaimed himself the \"Resurrection\" and the \"way to the Father.\" 60a m He was considered the \"Beginning, the Middle and the End,\" (\"Alpha and Omega\"), as well as being omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. m His disciples bestowed upon him the title \"Jezeus,\" meaning \"pure essence.\" 61 m Krishna is to return to do battle with the \"Prince of Evil,\" who will desolate the earth. 62 Prometheus of Greece The Greek god Prometheus has been claimed to have come from Egypt, but his drama took place in the Caucasus mountains. Prometheus shares a number of striking similarities with the Christ character. m Prometheus descended from heaven as God incarnate as man, to save mankind. m He was crucified, suffered and rose from the dead. m He was called the Logos or Word. 62a Five centuries before the Christian era, esteemed Greek poet Aeschylus wrote Prometheus Bound , which, according to Taylor, was presented in the theater in Athens. Taylor claims that in the play Prometheus is crucified \"on a fatal tree\" and the sky goes dark: \"The darkness which closed the scene on the suffering Prometheus, was easily exhibited on the stage, by putting out the lamps; but when the tragedy was to become history, and the fiction to be turned into fact, the lamp of day could not be so easily disposed of. Nor can it be denied that the miraculous darkness which the Evangelists so solemnly declare to have attended the crucifixion of Christ, labours http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (15 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive under precisely the same fatality of an absolute and total want of evidence.\" 63 Tradition holds that Prometheus was crucified on a rock, yet some sources have opined that legend also held he was crucified on a tree and that Christians muddled the story and/or mutilated the text, as they did with the works of so many ancient authors. In any case, the sun hiding in darkness parallels the Christian fable of the darkness descending when Jesus was crucified. This remarkable occurrence is not recorded in history but is only explainable within the Mythos and as part of a recurring play. The Creation of a Myth The Christians went on a censorship rampage that led to the virtual illiteracy of the ancient world and ensured that their secret would be hidden from the masses 64 , but the scholars of other schools/sects never gave up their arguments against the historicizing of a very ancient mythological creature. We have lost the arguments of these learned dissenters because the Christians destroyed any traces of their works. Nonetheless, the Christians preserved the contentions of their detractors through the Christians' own refutations. For example, early Church Father Tertullian (@ 160-220 C.E.), an \"ex-Pagan\" and Bishop of Carthage, ironically admits the true origins of the Christ story and of all other such godmen by stating in refutation of his critics, \"You say we worship the sun; so do you.\" 65 Interestingly, a previously strident believer and defender of the faith, Tertullian later renounced Christianity 66 . The \"Son\" of God is the \" Sun \" of God 67 The reason why all these narratives are so similar, with a godman who is crucified and resurrected, who does http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (16 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive miracles and has 12 disciples, is that these stories were based on the movements of the sun through the heavens, an astrotheological development that can be found throughout the planet because the sun and the 12 zodiac signs can be observed around the globe. In other words, Jesus Christ and all the others upon whom this character is predicated are personifications of the sun, and the Gospel fable is merely a rehash of a mythological formula (the \"Mythos,\" as mentioned above) revolving around the movements of the sun through the heavens. 68 For instance, many of the world's crucified godmen have their traditional birthday on December 25th (\"Christmas\" 69 ). This is because the ancients recognized that (from an earthcentric perspective) the sun makes an annual descent southward until December 21st or 22nd, the winter solstice, when it stops moving southerly for three days and then starts to move northward again. During this time, the ancients declared that \"God's sun\" had \"died\" for three days and was \"born again\" on December 25th. The ancients realized quite abundantly that they needed the sun to return every day and that they would be in big trouble if the sun continued to move southward and did not stop and reverse its direction. Thus, these many different cultures celebrated the \"sun of God's\" birthday on December 25th. 70 The following are the characteristics of the \"sun of God\": m The sun \"dies\" for three days on December 22nd, the winter solstice, when it stops in its movement south, to be born again or resurrected on December 25th, when it resumes its movement north. m In some areas, the calendar originally began in the constellation of Virgo, and the sun would therefore be \"born of a Virgin.\" m The sun is the \"Light of the World.\" m The sun \"cometh on clouds, and every eye shall see him.\" m The sun rising in the morning is the \"Savior of http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (17 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive mankind.\" m The sun wears a corona, \"crown of thorns\" or halo. 71 m The sun \"walks on water.\" m The sun's \"followers,\" \"helpers\" or \"disciples\" are the 12 months and the 12 signs of the zodiac or constellations, through which the sun must pass. m The sun at 12 noon is in the house or temple of the \"Most High\"; thus, \"he\" begins \"his Father's work\" at \"age\" 12. m The sun enters into each sign of the zodiac at 30°; hence, the \"Sun of God\" begins his ministry at \"age\" 30. m The sun is hung on a cross or \"crucified,\" which represents its passing through the equinoxes, the vernal equinox being Easter, at which time it is then resurrected. 72 Contrary to popular belief, the ancients were not an ignorant and superstitious lot who actually believed their deities to be literal characters. Indeed, this slanderous propaganda has been part of the conspiracy to make the ancients appear as if they were truly the dark and dumb rabble that was in need of the \"light of Jesus.\" 73 The reality is that the ancients were no less advanced in their morals and spiritual practices, and in many cases were far more advanced, than the Christians in their own supposed morality and ideology, which, in its very attempt at historicity, is in actuality a degradation of the ancient Mythos. Indeed, unlike the \"superior\" Christians, the true intelligentsia amongst the ancients were well aware that their gods were astronomical and atmospheric in nature. Socrates, Plato and Aristotle 74 surely knew that Zeus, the sky god father figure who migrated to Greece from India and/or Egypt, was never a real person, despite the fact that the Greeks have designated on Crete both a birth cave and a death cave of Zeus. In addition, all over the world are to be found sites where this god or that allegedly was born, walked, suffered, died, etc., a common and unremarkable occurrence that is not http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (18 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive monopolized by, and did not originate with, Christianity. 74a Etymology Tells the Story Zeus, aka \"Zeus Pateras,\" who we now automatically believe to be a myth and not a historical figure, takes his name from the Indian version, \"Dyaus Pitar.\" Dyaus Pitar in turn is related to the Egyptian \"Ptah,\" and from both Pitar and Ptah comes the word \"pater,\" or \"father.\" \"Zeus\" equals \"Dyaus,\" which became \"Deos,\" \"Deus\" and \"Dios\" - \"God.\" \"Zeus Pateras,\" like Dyaus Pitar, means, \"God the Father,\" a very ancient concept that in no way originated with \"Jesus\" and Christianity. There is no question of Zeus being a historical character. Dyaus Pitar becomes \"Jupiter\" in Roman mythology, and likewise is not representative of an actual, historical character. In Egyptian mythology, Ptah, the Father, is the unseen god- force, and the sun was viewed as Ptah's visible proxy who brings everlasting life to the earth; hence, the \"son of God\" is really the \"sun of God.\" Indeed, according to Hotema, the very name \"Christ\" comes from the Hindi word \"Kris\" (as in Krishna), which is a name for the sun. 75 Furthermore, since Horus was called \"Iusa/Iao/Iesu\" 76 the \"KRST,\" and Krishna/Christna was called \"Jezeus,\" centuries before any Jewish character similarly named, it would be safe to assume that Jesus Christ is just a repeat of Horus and Krishna, among the rest. According to Rev. Taylor, the title \"Christ\" in its Hebraic form meaning \"Anointed\" (\"Masiah\" 77 ) was held by all kings of Israel, as well as being \"so commonly assumed by all sorts of impostors, conjurers, and pretenders to supernatural communications, that the very claim to it is in the gospel itself considered as an indication of imposture . . .\" 78 Hotema states that the name \"Jesus Christ\" was not formally adopted in its present form until after the first Council of Nicea, i.e., in 325 C.E. 79 In actuality, even the place names and the appellations of http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (19 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive many other characters in the New Testament can be revealed to be Hebraicized renderings of the Egyptian texts. As an example, in the fable of \"Lazarus,\" the mummy raised from the dead by Jesus, the Christian copyists did not change his name much, \"El-Azar-us\" being the Egyptian mummy raised from the dead by Horus possibly 1,000 years or more before the Jewish version. 80 This story is allegory for the sun reviving its old, dying self, or father, as in \"El-Osiris.\" 81 It is not a true story. Horus's principal enemy - originally Horus's other face or \"dark\" aspect - was \"Set\" or \"Sata,\" whence comes \"Satan.\" 82 Horus struggles with Set in the exact manner that Jesus battles with Satan, with 40 days in the wilderness, among other similarities. 83 This is because this myth represents the triumph of light over dark, or the sun's return to relieve the terror of the night. \"Jerusalem\" simply means \"City of Peace,\" and the actual city in Israel was named after the holy city of peace in the Egyptian sacred texts that already existed at the time the city was founded. Likewise, \"Bethany,\" site of the famous multiplying of the loaves, means \"House of God,\" and is allegory for the \"multiplication of the many out of the One.\" 84 Any town of that designation was named for the allegorical place in the texts that existed before the town's foundation. The Egyptian predecessor and counterpart is \"Bethanu.\" 85 The Book of Revelation is Egyptian and Zoroastrian One can find certain allegorical place names such as \"Jerusalem\" and \"Israel\" in the Book of Revelation. Massey has stated that Revelation, rather than having been written by any apostle called John during the 1st Century C.E., is a very ancient text that dates to the beginning of this era of history, i.e. possibly as early as http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (20 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive 4,000 years ago. 86 Massey asserts that Revelation relates the Mithraic legend of Zarathustra/Zoroaster. 87 Hotema says of this mysterious book, which has baffled mankind for centuries: \"It is expressed in terms of creative phenomena; its hero is not Jesus but the Sun of the Universe, its heroine is the Moon; and all its other characters are Planets, Stars and Constellations; while its stage-setting comprises the Sky, the Earth, the Rivers and the Sea.\" The common form of this text has been attributed by Churchward to Horus's scribe, Aan, whose name has been passed down to us as \"John.\" 88 The word Israel itself, far from being a Jewish appellation, probably comes from the combination of three different reigning deities: Isis, the Earth Mother Goddess revered throughout the ancient world; Ra, the Egyptian sungod; and El, the Semitic deity passed down in form as Saturn. 90 El was one of the earliest names for the god of the ancient Hebrews (whence Emmanu-El, Micha-El, Gabri- El, Samu-El, etc.), and his worship is reflected in the fact that the Jews still consider Saturday as \"God's Day.\" 91 Indeed, that the Christians worship on Sunday betrays the genuine origins of their god and godman. Their \"savior\" is actually the sun, which is the \"Light of the world that every eye can see.\" The sun has been viewed consistently throughout history as the savior of mankind for reasons that are obvious. Without the sun, the planet would scarcely last one day. So important was the sun to the ancients that they composed a \"Sun Book,\" or \"Helio Biblia,\" which became the \"Holy Bible.\" 91a The \"Patriarchs\" and \"Saints\" are the Gods of Other Cultures When one studies mythmaking, one can readily discern and delineate a pattern that is repeated throughout history. Whenever an invading culture takes over its predecessors, it either vilifies the preceding deities or http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (21 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive makes them into lesser gods, \"patriarchs\" or, in the case of Christianity, \"saints.\" This process is exemplified in the adoption of the Hindu god Brahma as the Hebrew patriarch Abraham. 92 Another school of thought proposes that the patriarch Joshua was based on Horus as \"Iusa,\" since the cult of Horus had migrated by this period to the Levant. In this theory, the cult of Joshua, which was situated in exactly the area where the Christ drama allegedly took place, then mutated into the Christian story, with Joshua becoming Jesus. 93 As Robertson says, \"The Book of Joshua leads us to think that he had several attributes of the Sun-god, and that, like Samson and Moses, he was an ancient deity reduced to human status.\" Indeed, the legend of Moses, rather than being that of a historical Hebrew character, is found around the ancient Middle and Far East, with the character having different names and races, depending on the locale: \"Manou\" is the Indian legislator; \"Nemo the lawgiver,\" who brought down the tablets from the Mountain of God, hails from Babylon; \"Mises\" is found in Syria and Egypt, where also \"Manes the lawgiver\" takes the stage; \"Minos\" is the Cretan reformer; and the Ten Commandments are simply a repetition of the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi and the Hindu Vedas, among others. 94 Like Moses, Krishna was placed by his mother in a reed boat and set adrift in a river to be discovered by another woman. 95 A century ago, Massey outlined, and Graham recently reiterated, that even the Exodus itself is not a historical event. That the historicity of the Exodus has been questioned is echoed by the lack of any archaeological record, as is reported in Biblical Archaeology Review (\"BAR\"), September/October 1994. 96 Like many biblical characters, Noah is also a myth 97 , long ago appropriated from the Egyptians, the Sumerians and others, as any sophisticated scholar could demonstrate, and yet we find all sorts of books - some even http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (22 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive presumably \"channeling\" the \"ultimate truth\" from a mystical, omniscient, omnipresent and eternal being such as Jesus himself - prattling on about a genuine, historical Noah, his extraordinary adventures, and the \"Great Flood!\" 98 Additionally, the \"Esther\" of the Old Testament Book of Esther is a remake of the Goddess Ishtar, Astarte, Astoreth or Isis, from whom comes \"Easter\" 99 and about whose long and ubiquitous reign little is said in \"God's infallible Word.\" 100 The Virgin Mother/Goddess/Queen of Heaven motif is found around the globe, long before the Christian era, with Isis, for instance, also being called \"Mata-Meri\" (\"Mother Mary\"). As Walker says, \"Mari\" was the \"basic name of the Goddess known to the Chaldeans as Marratu, to the Jews as Marah, to the Persians as Mariham, to the Christians as Mary . . . Semites worshipped an androgynous combination of Goddess and God called Mari-El (Mary-God), corresponding to the Egyptian Meri-Ra, which combined the feminine principle of water with the masculine principle of the sun.\" Even the Hebraic name of God, \"Yahweh,\" was taken from the Egyptian \"IAO.\" 101 In one of the most notorious of Christian deceptions, in order to convert followers of \"Lord Buddha,\" the Church canonized him as \"St. Josaphat,\" which represented a Christian corruption of the buddhistic title, \"Bodhisat.\" 102 The \"Disciples\" are the Signs of the Zodiac Moreover, it is no accident that there are 12 patriarchs and 12 disciples, 12 being the number of the astrological signs, or months. Indeed, like the 12 Herculean tasks and the 12 \"helpers\" of Horus, Jesus's 12 disciples are symbolic for the zodiacal signs and do not depict any literal figures who played out a drama upon the earth circa 30 C.E. The disciples can be shown to have been http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (23 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive an earlier deity/folkloric hero/constellation. 103 Peter is easily revealed to be a mythological character 104 , while Judas has been said to represent Scorpio, \"the backbiter,\" the time of year when the sun's rays are weakening and the sun appears to be dying. 105 James, \"brother of Jesus\" and \"brother of the Lord,\" is equivalent to Amset, brother of Osiris and brother of the Lord. 106 Massey says \"Taht-Matiu was the scribe of the gods, and in Christian art Matthew is depicted as the scribe of the gods, with an angel standing near him, to dictate the gospel.\" 107 Even the apostle Paul is a compilation of several characters: The Old Testament Saul, Apollonius of Tyana and the Greek demigod Orpheus. 108 Was Jesus an Essene Master? 109 As regards Jesus being an Essene according to \"secret\" Dead Sea Scrolls, even before the discovery of the scrolls, over the centuries there has been much speculation to this effect, but Massey skillfully argued that many of Jesus's presumed teachings were either in contradiction to or were non-existent in Essene philosophy. 110 The Essenes did not believe in corporeal resurrection, nor did they believe in a carnalized messiah. They did not accept the historicity of Jesus. They were not followers of the Hebrew Bible, or its prophets, or the concept of the original fall that must produce a savior. Massey further points out that the Essenes were teetotalers and ate to live rather than the other way around. Compared to this, the assumed Essene Jesus appears to be a glutton and drunkard. Also, whereas according to Josephus the Essenes abhorred the swearing of oaths, Jesus was fond of \"swearing unto\" his disciples. 111 While many Essenic doctrines are included in the New Testament, the list of disparities between the Dead Sea Scroll Essenes and their alleged great master Jesus goes on. 112 Qumran is Not an Essene Community http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (24 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive It should also be noted that there is another debate as to whether or not Qumran, the site traditionally associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls, was an Essene community. In BAR, previously cited, it is reported that archaeological finds indicate Qumran was not an Essene community but was possibly a waystation for travelers and merchants crossing the Dead Sea. In BAR, it has also been hypothesized that the fervent tone and warrior-stance of some of the scrolls unearthed near Qumran belie any Essene origin and indicate a possible attribution to Jewish Zealots instead. In Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls , Norman Golb makes a very good case that the Dead Sea Scrolls were not written by any Essene scribes but were a collection of tomes from various libraries that were secreted in caves throughout eastern Israel by Jews fleeing the Roman armies during the First Revolt of 70 A. D. Golb also hypothesizes that Qumran itself was a fortress, not a monastery. In any case, it is impossible to equate the \"Teacher of Righteousness\" found in any scrolls with Jesus Christ. Was the New Testament Composed by Therapeuts? In 1829 Rev. Taylor adeptly made the case that the entire Gospel story was already in existence long before the beginning of the Common Era and was probably composed by the monks at Alexandria called \"Therapeuts\" in Greek and \"Essenes\" in Egyptian, both names meaning \"healers.\" 113 This theory has stemmed in part from the statement of early church father Eusebius, who, in a rare moment of seeming honesty, \"admitted . . . that the canonical Christian gospels and epistles were the ancient writings of the Essenes or Therapeutae reproduced in the name of Jesus.\" 114 Taylor also opines that \"the travelling Egyptian Therapeuts brought the whole story from India to their monasteries in Egypt, where, some time after the commencement of the Roman http://relfrauds.www4.50megs.com/christianity/origins.htm (25 of 27)3/4/2004 2:28:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Origins of Christianity- David Icke - Religious Frauds Archive monarchy, it was transmuted in Christianity.\" 115 In addition, Wheless evinces that one can find much of the fable of \"Jesus Christ\" in the Book of Enoch 116 , which predated the supposed advent of the Jewish master by hundreds of years. 117 According to Massey, it was the \"pagan\" Gnostics - who included members of the Essene/ Therapeut and Nazarene 118 brotherhoods, among others - who actually carried to Rome the esoteric (gnostic) texts containing the Mythos, upon which the numerous gospels, including the canonical four, were based. Wheless says, \"Obviously, the Gospels and other New Testament booklets, written in Greek and quoting 300 times the Greek Septuagint, and several Greek Pagan authors, as Aratus, and Cleanthes, were written, not by illiterate Jewish peasants, but by Greek-speaking ex- Pagan Fathers and priests far from the Holy Land of the Jews.\" 119 Mead averred, \"We thus conclude that the autographs of our four Gospels were most probably written in Egypt, in the reign of Hadrian.\" 120 Conclusion As Walker said, \"Scholars' efforts to eliminate paganism from the Gospels in order to find a historical Jesus have proved as hopeless as searching for a core in an onion.\" The \"gospel\" story of Jesus is not a factual portrayal of a historical \"master\" who walked the earth 2,000 years ago. It is a myth built upon other myths and godmen, who in turn were personifications of the ubiquitous sungod mythos. The Christ of the gospels is in no sense an historical personage or a supreme model of humanity, a hero who strove, and suffered, and failed to save the world by his death. It is impossible to establish the existence of an historical character even as an impostor .
