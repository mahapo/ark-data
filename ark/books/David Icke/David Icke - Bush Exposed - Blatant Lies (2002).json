[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"GET OUT OF THIS ONE THEN GEORGIE BOY PRESIDENT BUSH EXPOSED FOR PROVABLE AND BLATANT LIES OVER SEPTEMBER 11 TH By David Icke Earlier this month , on December 4 th , I was sitting in a hotel bar in Bermuda watching CNN as I killed time waiting for a flight after my talk there . CNN were broadcasting live coverage of a \" town meeting \" at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando , Florida , where President Bush was answering non - challenging questions from a sycophantic audience . Then suddenly , as I sipped my beer and despaired at the hero worship being enjoyed by the village idiot , Bush made a startling statement about September 11 th and I said to my wife - \" you won ' t believe what this guy has just said , I bet the spin doctors are screaming at the screen . \" For the next two days I scanned the newspapers , the Internet \" news \" sites , etc . , including CNN , but there was no mention of the amazing statement he made . Nor had I found any mention of it since . That did not surprise me at all , but now , thanks to Didier , a reader of the David Icke website in Belgium , I have the words that Bush said - ironically posted by the White House website , hidden away in the full transcript of the meeting : www . whitehouse . gov / news / releases / 2001 / 12 / 20011204 - 17 . html Bush was talking about what happened on September 11 th and how he heard of the atrocities in New York . If you remember , Bush was at a school in Florida where he was taking part in a photo opportunity , which included reading a story about a pet goat to a class of children . The media around the world told us , from White House statements , that Bush heard of the twin tower attacks when his chief of staff , Andrew Card , spoke in his ear in the classroom as he addressed the children . There was the famous picture of Card leaning over Bush accompanied by headlines like : The Moment Bush Knew . But Bush told the Florida town meeting a very different story . This is what he said about what happened that morning in answer to a question by someone named Jordan : \" Well , Jordan , you ' re not going to believe what state I was in when I heard about the terrorist attack . I was in Florida . And my Chief of Staff , Andy Card - - actually , I was in a classroom talking about a reading program that works . I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in , and I saw an airplane hit the tower - - the TV was obviously on . And I used to fly , myself , and I said , well , there ' s one terrible pilot . I said , it must have been a horrible accident . But I was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"whisked off there , I didn ' t have much time to think about it . And I was sitting in the classroom , and Andy Card , my Chief of Staff , who is sitting over here , walked in and said , \" A second plane has hit the tower , America is under attack . \" THIS IS STAGGERING - THERE WAS NO LIVE TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE HITTING THE TOWER - HOW COULD THERE BE ?? THE FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST CRASH WAS TAKEN BY ONLOOKERS AND SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND DID NOT AIR FOR HOURS AND DAYS AFTER IT HAPPENED . THERE WAS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE SECOND CRASH , OF COURSE , BUT NOT OF THE FIRST - SO HOW ON EARTH CAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CLAIM TO A PUBLIC MEETING TO HAVE SEEN IT LIVE ON A TELEVISION OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM WHERE HE WAS WAITING TO ADDRESS THOSE CHILDREN ?? AND WHY HAS NO NEWS ORGANISATION OR \" JOURNALIST \" PICKED UP THIS FANTASTIC LIE ? And what about that statement about \" there ' s one terrible pilot \" . What ?? A passenger jet crashes into one of the twin towers full of people and all the President of the United States can say is \" there ' s one terrible pilot \"!! And then he walks into a classroom to read a story about a pet goat ?? God help us . \" There ' s one terrible pilot \"? We are not talking a light plane flown by an amateur , but a commerical airliner and even if it had not been a terrorist outrage , it would still have been an enormous tragedy requiring the leadership of the US president . But of course none of this tissue of lies by Bush could have happened because he could not possibly have seen the first crash on live television because there was no live coverage . The fact that Bush KNEW the plane was going to hit the tower is more like it because he , like his masters who orchestrated it , was well aware of what was going to unfold that morning . AND EVEN AFTER HE CLAIMS THAT HIS CHIEF OF STAFF TOLD HIM OF THE SECOND PLANE , AND THAT \" AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK \" , BUSH WENT ON READING THE STORY ABOUT THE PET GOAT !! YOU SIMPLY COULDN ' T MAKE THIS UP , COULD YOU ?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"As Associated Press reported on September 12 th : \" In Sarasota , Florida , Bush was reading to children in a classroom at 9 : 05 a . m . when his chief of staff , Andrew Card , whispered into his ear . The president briefly turned somber before he resumed reading . He addressed the tragedy about a half - hour later . \" \" Briefly \" remained somber ?? He ' s just been told that the New York twin towers have been struck by commercial airliners . Death and destruction on a massive scale was already obvious and the President was \" briefly somber \" before continuing to read a children ' s story ? Bush told the town meeting : \" But I knew I needed to act . I knew that if the nation ' s under attack , the role of the Commander - in - Chief is to respond forcefully to prevent other attacks from happening . And so , I ' ve talked to the Secretary of Defense ; one of the first acts I did was to put our military on alert . \" BUT HE COULD NOT HAVE TALKED TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENCE UNTIL HE FINISHED THE GOAT STORY AND LEFT THE CLASSROOM AND ONLY THEN DID HE PUT AMERICA ON ALERT . HOW MUCH CRUCIAL TIME WAS LOST THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED , FOR INSTANCE , THE ATTACK ON THE PENTAGON , WHICH HAPPENED 40 MINUTES AFTER THE SECOND TOWER WAS HIT ?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Bush has been caught in a monumental lie here and it is just one of the endless daily lies that gush forth from the lips of this lying imbecile , who is currently a national hero . So news media , where are you when a real story is set before you ? I would appreciate it if people could circulate this to all the news media you can think of and bombard the White House with requests for a statement about the provable , blatant , lies of the President of the United States about one of the darkest days in US history .
