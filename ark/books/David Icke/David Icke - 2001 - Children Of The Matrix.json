One is to be free of any dogmatic beliefsystem.The second is not to give a damn what people think and say about you, or,at least,not to let that influence your decisions.Without number one you will never go into the bizarre areas that are necessarytounderstand the forces that control this planet. Once you are facedwithinformation that demolishes your belief system you will begin to edit whatyouhave discovered and refuse to go where it is taking you. Without numbertwo,you will never communicate what you have found because you will beterrifiedof the consequences for you from the reaction of your friends, familyand thepublic in general.You are about to read a book by someone who will go wherever theinformationtakes him and who, thanks to hard and extreme experience in the early1990s, let gothe concern for what other people might think of him. And so we aregoing to entersome apparently bizarre and outrageous areas of thought anddocumentedevidence. If you have a belief-system to defend, please don't wasteyour time andmoney. This is not for you. But, in truth, what you are going tohear is notoutrageous at all. It just appears to be so because it is sodifferent from theconditioned \"norm\". Crazy and insane are words used throughouthistory todescribe people and ideas that are simply different. And differentdoes not meanwrong. So many condemned and ridiculed ideas in the past have laterbecomeconventional wisdom.First they ridicule you; then they condemn you; then they say they knew youwereright all along.This book is designed to pull together the evidence and background oftheextraterrestrial, inner-terrestrial, and interdimensional control of PlanetEarthfor thousands of years to the present day. To do this, 1 have weavedtogetherinformation in The Biggest Secret with a mass of new historical andmodernaccounts, to present as clear a picture as possible of the forces thatdailymanipulate and direct the lives of the human race. This is not the wholestory,however, just part of it. There is still so much more to know. Readers ofmyprevious books will see information they already know fused with thelatestknowledge and developments because it is important that my books areselfcontained so that new readers will have all they need to follow the plot. 1haveXVIChildren of the Matrixendeavoured to keep the book simple and to the point for those billions ofpeoplewho have never had access to such information before.

Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lordandmaster. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, itsuppresses ourprotest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don'tdo so... I havebeen beating around the bush all this time, insinuating to youthat something isholding us prisoner. Indeed we are held prisoner!\"This was an energetic fact for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico ... They tookusover because we are food for them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because wearetheir sustenance. Just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, the predatorsrear us inhuman coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available tothem.\"\"No, no, no, no,\" [Carlos replies] \"This is absurd don Juan. What you're sayingissomething monstrous. It simply can't be true, for sorcerers or for averagemen, orfor anyone.\"\"Why not?\" don Juan asked calmly. \"Why not? Because it infuriates you? ...Youhaven't heard all the claims yet. I want to appeal to your analytical mind.Think fora moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions betweentheintelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs,or thestupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe that thepredators havegiven us our systems of belief, our ideas of good and evil, oursocial mores. Theyare the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreamsof success orfailure. They have given us covetousness, greed, and cowardice. Itis the predatorswho make us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal.\"\"'But how can they do this, don Juan?' [Carlos] asked, somehow angered furtherbywhat [don Juan] was saying. \"Do they whisper all that in our ears while weareasleep?\"\"'No, they don't do it that way. That's idiotic!” don Juan said, smiling. \"Theyareinfinitely more efficient and organized than that. In order to keep usobedient andmeek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a stupendousmanoeuvre -XXChildren of the Matrixstupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting strategist. Ahorrendousmanoeuvre from the point of view of those who suffer it. They gave ustheir mind!Do you hear me? The predators give us their mind, which becomes ourmind. Thepredators' mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fearof beingdiscovered any minute now.”\"I know that even though you have never suffered hunger... you have foodanxiety,which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears that anymomentnow its manoeuvre is going to be uncovered and food is going to bedenied.Through the mind, which, after all, is their mind, the predators inject intothelives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. And they ensure, inthismanner, a degree of security to act as a buffer against their fear.\"\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico were quite ill at ease with the idea of when[thepredator] made its appearance on Earth. They reasoned that man must havebeen acomplete being at one point, with stupendous insights, feats of awarenessthat aremythological legends nowadays. And then, everything seems to disappear,and wehave now a sedated man. What I'm saying is that what we have against us isnot asimple predator. It is very smart, and organized. It follows a methodicalsystem torender us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, isno longermagical. He's an average piece of meat.\"\"There are no more dreams for man but the dreams of an animal who is beingraisedto become a piece of meat: trite, conventional, imbecilic.\"Castaneda, 1998The plotMany thousands of years ago, way back in \"pre-history\", there was ahighlydeveloped civilisation in the Pacific, which has become known as Lemuria,orMu. These peoples and others also founded another great culture on a landmassinthe Atlantic, which we know as Atlantis.The knowledge that created these advanced societies, the knowledge that builtthefantastic and unexplainable ancient structures like the Great Pyramid andotheramazing sites across the world, came from the stars - extraterrestrials ofmanyvarieties. Some were tall blond-haired, blue-eyed, types, while others tookareptilian form (see picture section for artists' impressions of these beings).These andothers came here from constellations like Orion, Draco, Andromeda,Lyra, andBootes, and other locations like the Pleiades, Sirius, Vega, ZetaReticuli, Arcturus,Aldebaran, and elsewhere. Australian aborigines, Africantribes, the Babylonians,and South American Indians are just some of the diversepeoples who claim ancientconnections with such places. The reptilians are atall, mostly humanoid-type race,with snake-like eyes and skin and they areconnected to the classic \"greys\" with thebig black \"eyes\", which have become thevery symbol of the \"ET\". Often thesevarious extraterrestrial factions battledfor supremacy in the legendary \"wars of thegods\". These technologically advancedbeings were believed to be gods by thehuman races because of the apparentlymiraculous feats they could achieve withtheir technology and flying craft. Bythe way, for those who find it impossible toconceive of \"intelligent\" life formsand humanoids taking a reptilian form, ponderon the words of the cosmologist,Carl Sagan: \"There are more potentialcombinations of DNA (physical forms) thanthere are atoms in the universe.\"On that basis, given the fantastic diversity ofthe reptilian species on the Earthalone, it would be more amazing if there werenot reptilians of a humanoid andintelligent variety.These \"gods\" interbred with each other and the more primitive Earth peopleandthese unions are recorded in endless ancient accounts. These were the Sons ofGodwho interbred with the daughters of men to seed the hybrid race, the Nefilim,asdescribed in the Old Testament book of Genesis. The most importantinterbreedingwas between the reptilians and the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Nordicpeoples, both ofextraterrestrial origin, as an alliance was formed betweenfactions of these races.The union produced what has been called the Aryan or\"noble\" race - the \"masterrace\" of the Nazis. This is the fusion of the Nordicand reptilian DNA (the geneticxxii Children of the Matrixcode that decides physical characteristics) and, as the ancient records confirm,itwas these \"royal\" bloodlines, the reptilian-Nordic hybrids, that were placedin thepositions of ruling royal power in the thousands of years before \"known\"history.They were the kings and queens who claimed the \"divine right\" to rulebecause oftheir bloodline - the bloodline of the gods. These ancient royal linesin places likeEgypt, Sumer, and the Indus Valley, had a white skin and oftenblue eyes, yet theywere known as the Dragon Kings or Serpent Kings by those whoknew the secret oftheir hybrid nature.Lemuria was destroyed by a staggering cataclysm that struck the Earth,maybe11,500 to 12,000 years ago. Atlantis went the same way, in stages, overthethousands of years that followed. The universal stories of the Great Floodarerelated to this. When Atlantis came to an end amid more enormousgeologicalupheavals, the bloodlines and their \"gods\" began again in the Near andMiddleEast from about 4.000BC with an empire based in Sumer in what is nowIraq,between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. Sumer, according to official\"history\", wasthe stai't of human \"civilisation\", but, in fact, it was merelythe re-start after theAtlantis upheavals. The seeding of extraterrestrial-humanbloodlines continuedand so did the policy of placing the purest of thesehybrids, the reptilian-Nordics,into the positions of royal and administrativepower over the people in Sumer,Egypt, Babylon, the Indus Valley, and, as theSumer Empire expanded, muchfurther afield. Similar seeding went on in otherparts of the world, like theAmericas and China, but the Middle Eastern area wasthe most important to theseextraterrestrial factions (at least at that time).These factions were dominated bythe reptilian or \"serpent race\".Over thousands of years these peoples expanded out of the Middle and NearEastinto Europe and the \"royal\" bloodlines of Sumer, Egypt, etc., became theroyaland aristocratic families of Britain, Ireland, and the countries ofmainland Europe,especially France and Germany. Wherever they went, these \"royal\"lines interbredobsessively with each other through arranged marriages and secretbreedingprogrammes. We see the same with the ruling families of today becausethey areseeking to perpetuate a particular genetic code, which can be quicklydiluted bybreeding outside of their hybrid circle. In the ancient world, one ofthe headquartersfor the secret society network or Illuminati, through whichthese bloodlinesmanipulate humanity, was Babylon, also in the lands of Sumer.This Illuminatinetwork then moved its headquarters to Rome and during that timecame theRoman Empire and the creation of the Roman Church, orinstitutionalisedChristianity. The headquarters moved on into northern Europeafter the fall of theRoman Empire and for a period was based in Amsterdam, TheNetherlands. Thiswas when the Dutch began to build their empire through theDutch East IndiaCompany and they settled South Africa. In 1688, one of thesehybrid bloodlines,William of Orange, invaded England from The Netherlands andtook the Britishthrone as William III in 1689. William ruled jointly with QueenMary and alone afterher death in 1694. From this time, the Illuminati movedtheir centre of operations toLondon. What followed, of course, was the \"Great\"and enormous British Empire.The plot xxiiiThis vast expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts oftheworld exported these Nefilim hybrid bloodlines to every continent, including,mostimportantly today, to North America. When these European empires begantorecede and collapse, especially in the 20th century, it appeared that theselands, likethe Americas, Africa, and Australia, had won their \"independence\".Instead, theNefilim bloodlines and the Illuminati merely exchanged overt controlfor the farmore effective covert control. While these empires apparentlywithdrew, they leftout in those countries, including the United States, thebloodlines and the secretsociety network through which they operate. Ever sincethey have continued tocontrol events in these former colonies as part of along-planned agenda for thecomplete centralised control of the planet through aworld government, centralbank, currency, army, and a micro-chipped populationconnected to a globalcomputer. This is the very governmental structure that isnow staring us in the face.The bloodlines that control the world and our lives today are the samebloodlinesthat ruled Lemuria, Atlantis, Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, the Roman Empire,and theBritish and European empires. They are the presidents of the United States,theprime ministers, the leading banking and business families, the media owners,andthose who control the military. We have been ruled by the sameinterbreedingtribe of extraterrestrial or inner-terrestrial hybrids, theNefilim, for thousands ofyears and we are now facing a crucial time in theirunfolding agenda:The time when we, the people, either bring this hidden dictatorshipto an end orface a future, very shortly, in a global fascist state.That's the summary of what has happened and is happening. Now considerthedetailed evidence...CHAPTER 1. to theprison bornThere are none so enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free.GoetheWhen a few people wish to control and direct a mass of humanity, therearecertain key structures that have to be in place. These are the samewhetheryou are seeking to manipulate an individual, family, tribe, town,country,continent, or planet.First you have to set the \"norms\", what is considered right and wrong,possibleor impossible, sane or insane, good and bad. Most of the people willfollow thosenorms without question because of the baa-baa mentality, which hasprevailedwithin the collective human mind for at least thousands of years.Second, you haveto make life very unpleasant for those few who challenge yourimposed \"norms\".The most effective way to do this is to make it, in effect, acrime to be different. Sothose who beat to a different drum, or voice adifferent view, version of \"truth\" andlifestyle, stand out like a black sheep inthe human herd. You have alreadyconditioned that herd to accept your norms asreality and so, in their arrogance andignorance, they then ridicule or condemnthose with a different spin on life. Thispressurises them to conform and servesas a warning for those others in the herdwho are also thinking of breaking away.There is a Japanese saying that goes: Don'tbe a nail that stands out above therest because that's the first one to get hit.This creates a situation fundamental to the few controlling the many in whichthemasses police themselves and keep each other in line. The sheep becomethesheepdog for the rest of the herd.* It is like a prisoner trying to escapewhile the restof his cellmates rush to stop him. If that happened we would saythe prisoners werecrazy, how could they do that? But humans are doing preciselythis to each otherevery day by demanding that everyone conform to the norms towhich they blindlyconform. This is nothing less than psychological fascism - thethought police withagents in every home, everywhere. Agents so deeplyconditioned that most have noidea they are unpaid mind controllers. \"I'm justdoing what's right for my children\"I hear them say. No, what you have beenprogrammed to believe is right for them and* I know that strictly speaking the collective word for sheep is flock and notherd, but I prefer herd sosod convention.2Children of the Matrixthe belief, also, that only you know best. 1 remember debating with aformerChief Rabbi of the United Kingdom at the Oxford Union debating society andhesimply could not see a difference between education and indoctrination. It wasawonder to behold.We see this same theme in our daily experiences of people in uniform andothersfrom the masses who are promoted to power over the masses. It's summed upbythe satirical version of the British Labour Party song, The Red Flag, whichgoes: \"Theworking class can kiss my arse, I've got the foreman's job at last.\"This is all part ofthe divide and rule strategy so vital to ensuring that theherd will police itself.Everyone plays a part in everyone else's mental,emotional, and physicalimprisonment. All the controllers have to do is pull theright strings at the righttime and make their human puppets dance to theappropriate tune. This they do bydictating what is taught by what we bravelycall \"education\" and what passes for\"news\" through the media they own. In thisway they can dictate to the unthinking,unquestioning, herd what it shouldbelieve about itself, other people, life, history,and current events. Once youset the norms in society, there is no need to controlevery journalist orreporter or government official. The media and the institutionstake their\"truth\" from those same norms and therefore ridicule and condemn byreflex actionanyone who offers another vision of reality. Once you control what isconsidered\"normal\" and possible, the whole system virtually runs itself.The IlluminatiThe elite families, no more than 13 at the peak of their pyramid, createdandmanipulate this system of control through a network of secret societies.Thisnetwork and the bloodlines it serves have become known as the Illuminati,the\"Illuminated Ones\". In other words they are illuminated into knowledgethateveryone else is denied. The Illuminati is an organisation within allsignificantorganisations. It's like a cancer. All the major secret societiesfeed carefully chosenrecruits into the Illuminati and these are the ones youfind in positions of powerthroughout the world. They infest all colours, creeds,and countries. MostFreemasons never progress higher than the bottom three levelsof degree, the so-called Blue Degrees. They have no idea what their organisationis being used for.Even most of those who make it to the apparent peak, the 33rddegree in theScottish Rite, know relatively little. Only the tiny few, all froma particularbloodline, move through the top of their \"individual\" secret societyinto theIlluminati degrees above that. These are the levels into which all themajor secretsocieties feed. Yet at least 95% of their members have no idea thatthese levels exist,never mind who is in them.The bloodlinesThe Illuminati bloodlines are all genetically connected through hybrid DNA,agenetic fusion caused by the interbreeding of a reptilian race with humanityandthe Nordic extraterrestrial race. This interbreeding began hundreds ofthousands ofyears ago and continues to the present day. If you are hearing thisfor the first time,3I know how bizarre and crazy it sounds to the conditioned view of reality. Butyouwill see in the pages that follow the scale of the evidence to support thisapparentlyridiculous story and how it explains a stream of ancient and modern\"mysteries\".So many things that later turn out to be true appear at firsthearing to beimpossible and insane. That's because people only hear the openingline and don'tread on to see the detailed evidence to support it. When peoplefirst suggested theEarth was round, they were called crazy because it wasthought that those livingon the bottom would have fallen off. The criticsdismissed the idea at this pointand walked away convinced that the Earth had tobe flat. Yet when you introducethe law of gravity, what seems at first to becrazy suddenly becomes far morecredible. So it is with the truth that anon-human race is controlling andmanipulating humanity through hybrid bloodlines- the same bloodlines thathave been placed in positions of power since ancienttimes. The supportingevidence is there if only people are prepared to open theirminds, as you willsee in this book and my others.It is these reptilian-Illuminati bloodlines, manifesting as political leadersandadministrators of government, that introduce the \"laws\" that will best servetheirplan to keep humanity in ongoing servitude. These laws, which the masseshave nosay in creating, are then enforced by members of those same masses -soldiers,policemen, security guards, and so on. These guys, and many womentoday, are justsystem-fodder. They are not encouraged to think for themselvesand it would not begood for promotion if they did. They are paid to do as theyare told, carry outorders, and administer the letter of the \"law\": the law ofthe elite families. My fatherused to say that rules and regulations were for theguidance of the intelligent andthe blind obedience of the idiot. But how many ofthose in the peaked capsadminister the law in a sensible,every-case-on-its-merits, think-for-yourselfmanner? A mere fraction. And oftenthey are far from popular with those higher upthe ladder. Soldiers don't ask forjustification for blowing away men, women, andchildren they have never met andknow nothing about. They don't question theirsuperiors about why they have tocommit genocide. They just do it because they aretold to do it and those doingthe telling are themselves carrying out orders fromthose above them. In the end,all roads of command lead ever upwards to the 13family bloodlines and theiroffshoots that are orchestrating an agenda to take overthe planet. That agendademands a world government, central bank, currency, andarmy, underpinned by amicro-chipped population connected to a global computernetwork. A ridiculousconspiracy \"theory\"? Oh really? Well have another lookaround you and you'll seethat this is happening today, NOWThe sheepleThe self-policing of the human herd goes far deeper than people in uniformoradministrators of government. It starts with conditioned parents who imposetheirconditioning on their children and pressure them to follow their religious,political,economic, and cultural norms. There is no more extreme example thanthose whoinsist their offspring succumb to arranged marriages because of therules of their4Children of the Matrixludicrous religion; or the children of Jehovah's Witnesses who have beendeniedlife-saving blood transfusions because their brain-dead parents insist onconductingevery aspect of their lives according to the contradictory dictates ofa bookpurveying stories of pure fantasy. The creation of the mental andemotional sheeppen of norms, which imprisons 99% of humanity, goes on minute byminute insubtle and less subtle ways. There are children of Christian, Jewish,Muslim, orHindu parents who don't accept the religion, but still follow itbecause they don'twant to upset their family. Then there is the almost universalfear of what peoplethink of us if we speak a different version of reality orlive a different kind of life.Note that the fear for those who wish to break outof the sheep pen is not the fear ofwhat the elite families, the Illuminati or\"Illuminated Ones\", will think of them.Most have no idea that such a networkexists. No, the fear is for what their motheror father will think, or theirfriends and workmates - the very people who areconditioned by the system to stayin the pen. The sheep are keeping the other sheepin line and making lifeunpleasant for anyone who tries to escape. It is so easy for asmall group ofinterbreeding family bloodlines to control the lives - in other wordsthe minds -of billions, once the key institutions of \"information\" are in place, astheyhave been for thousands of years in their various forms. There are not enoughofthese manipulators and their stooges to control the population physically andsothey have had to create a structure in which humans control themselvesthroughmental and emotional imposition.Once you have the herd mentality policing itself, there is a third phase inthisentrapment of human consciousness. You create factions within the herd andsetthem to war with each other. This is done by creating \"different\" beliefsystems(which are not different at all) and bringing them into conflict. Thesebelief systemsare known as religions, political parties, economic theories,countries, cultures, and\"isms\" of endless variety. These beliefs are perceivedas \"opposites\" when, as Ipointed out in my book, I Am Me, I Am Free, they areopposames. The vision ofreality and possibility within the pen is so limitedthat it contains no opposites. Sothe elite have to create the perception of themto manufacture the divisions thatallow them to divide and rule. I mean, what isthe difference between a Christianbishop, Jewish Rabbi, Muslim or Hindu priest,or a follower of Buddha, imposingtheir beliefs on their children and others?There is none because while the beliefthey seek to indoctrinate may be slightlydifferent, often very slightly, the overalltheme is exactly the same - theimposition of one person's belief on another. Lookat the opposames in politics.The Far Left, as symbolised by Josef Stalin in Russia,introduced centralisedcontrol, military dictatorship, and concentration camps. The\"opposite\" of thatwas the Far Right, as symbolised by Adolf Hitler. What was heinto? Centralisedcontrol, military dictatorship, and concentration camps. Yet thesetwo opposameswere set at war with each other amid propaganda that claimedthey were opposites.The only difference between the Soviet Union and theso-called \"West\" during theCold War was that the Soviet Union was openlycontrolled by the few and the Westwas secretly controlled by the few. And,when you get to the capstone of thepyramid, you find they were the same few5The Pyramid of Manipulationii.umi’-atiPicture #1 [images/img_0001.png]Le\\Leve^ of knowledge and h-erarcb> wrthmthe institutions. eg - hm Bank cash*rS/°**’**fC°^Dan C'lrr>*Figure 1: The interconnecting pyramids that allow the few to manipulate thelives of billions. At the highestlevel, all the major political, financial, andmedia institutions are controlled by the Illuminaticontrolling both \"sides”. The same force operating through Wall Street andtheCity of London funded all \"sides\" in the two world wars and that'sprovable(see ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free).So let us summarise the scam, (a) You need to first imprison the human mindwitha rigid belief and a fundamentally limited sense of reality - the sheep pen.Itdoesn't much matter what these beliefs may be, so long as they are rigidanddiscourage free thought and open-minded questions. Christianity, Judaism,Islam,Hinduism, and all the rest, each make their contribution to humanservitude whileapparently claiming different \"truths\", (b) You encourage thosewho follow theserigid beliefs to impose them on others and make life verydifficult and unpleasant foranyone who does not conform, (c) You bring thesebeliefs into conflict, so ensuringthe divide and rule you so desperately needfor control by the few. While the massesare so busy fighting each other andseeking to impose their beliefs and views on eachother, they don't see that theIlluminati have strings attached to all of them. Humansare like moths buzzingaround a light, so mesmerised by their religious belief, thefootball scores, thelatest row on a soap opera, or the price of friggin' beer, that theyfail tonotice the preparations being made to smash them on the arse with a swatter.Pyramids within pyramidsThe Illuminati have created a pyramid structure throughout society thatallowsthem to operate a global agenda that only a relative handful of peopleknow exists.It is like those Russian dolls with one doll inside another with thebiggest oneencompassing ah of them. The Illuminati replace the \"dolls\" withpyramids(Figure 1). Every organisation today is a pyramid. The few at the topknow whatthe organisation is really about and what it is trying to achieve. Thefurther you go6Children of the Matrixdown the pyramid the more people work for the organisation, but the lesstheyknow about its real agenda. They are only aware of the individual job theydoevery day. They have no idea how their contribution connects with that ofotheremployees in other areas of the company. They are compartmentalised fromthatknowledge and told only what they need to know to do their work. Thesesmallerpyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger and biggerpyramids, untileventually you have the pyramid that encompasses all the banks.It is the samewith the transnational corporations, political parties, secretsocieties, mediaempires, and the military. If you go high enough, all thetransnational corporations(like the oil cartel), major political parties, secretsocieties, media empires, and themilitary (via NATO, for instance), arecontrolled by the same pyramids and thesame people who sit at the top of all thepyramids. In the end there is a globalpyramid that encompasses all the others,the biggest \"doll\" if you like. At the topof this you will find the most eliteof the Illuminati, the \"purest\" of theirbloodlines. In this way, they canco-ordinate through apparently unconnected,even \"opposing\" areas of society, thesame policies. This is how they have createdthe explosion of centralisation inevery area of life: government, finance, business,media, military. It is not byaccident or natural occurrence. It is by coldlycalculated design.Jim Shaw, a former 33rd degree Freemason, exposes the Craft in his book,TheDeadly Deception (Huntington House Inc., Lafayette, Louisiana, 1988). Hedescribeshow Freemasonry is based on the same compartmentalised pyramids. Atthebottom are the three degrees known as the Blue Degrees and the vast majorityofFreemasons never progress beyond that through either the 33 degrees oftheScottish Rite or the 10 degrees of the York Rite.* Even at the 33rd degreeofFreemasonry you still don't know the real secrets unless you are one of thechosenfew (bloodline). Shaw says he was surprised when a fellow 33rd degreeMason saidthat \"they\" had told him he was \"going higher\" and the guy left thetemple by a\"different door\".1 There is, officially, no higher than the 33rddegree. But, of coursethere is. The top levels of the secret societies are onlythe top of their pyramid. Theyare also encompassed by a bigger pyramid, whichincludes all the secret societiesand they feed their chosen bloodline initiatesinto the unofficial Illuminati degreeswhere the real action and the real secretsare. But even at that level, the knowledgeis still compartmentalised. So youhave this vast web of secret societies withmillions of members worldwide whothink they know what they are involved in,but, in truth, only a tiny few haveany idea of what is going on and who, ultimately,is calling the shots. AlbertPike, who died in 1891, was one of the most pre-eminentfigures in worldFreemasonry. Among his titles were Sovereign Grand Commanderof the SupremeCouncil of the 33rd degree and Supreme Pontiff of UniversalFreemasonry. In hisbook. Morals and Dogma, written for higher degree Freemasons,he reveals the waythe lower levels are misled:* The 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite and 10 degrees of the York rite, bothinclude the Blue Degrees,of course.7\"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part ofthesymbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally mis-ledby falseinterpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, butit is intendedthat he shall imagine that he understands them...their trueimplication is reservedfor Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.\"2Exactly. Jim Shaw says that there are two kinds of Freemason. One justsitsthrough the meetings and doesn't make much effort to understand the ritual,andthe other does all the work, but only keeps to the ritual and memorises orreads thewords without understanding what they really mean. That's correct, butthere is athird kind: the very few who know the truth of who really controlsFreemasonryand what the rituals and initiations are really designed to achieve.Shaw alsoconfirms from his own experience how the Freemasons manipulate theirown intowhatever positions they choose. At work, his department director, afellowFreemason, advised him to apply for a particular job. Shaw felt he wasunder-qualified for the post and would fail the test paper.3 Only through theurging of hisFreemason boss did he apply. When he arrived to take the test hewas amazed tosee that there were only two other applicants for a job he believedwould be keenlycontested. When he turned over the test paper, he saw that thequestions were veryeasy and he finished them quickly. His two rivals, however,were clearly finding thepaper very tough and could not complete it in theallotted time. Shaw got the job.Why? Because he was not given the same paper asthe other two. When he walkedout of Freemasonry, the opposite happened. He foundhis bosses far less supportiveto say the least. This is just one small exampleof how the Illuminati and their secretsociety web ensure that their guys are inthe positions that matter. It is actuallyastonishing how few people you need tocontrol to dictate your agenda through thewhole system if they are (a) in thekey positions of decision-making and (b) theyhave the power to appoint those inthe important positions below them. Anexample: you control the chief of policewho decides the policy and he can appointthe heads of the various departments inhis force. He introduces Illuminati policyand chooses his major subordinatesfrom the secret society initiates. They, in turn,can appoint the people withintheir departments and can thus choose more secretsociety initiates for thepositions below them. So it goes on. Once you have controlof the top man in anyorganisation, the pyramid is built in his, i.e. the Illuminati's,image.Governments are structured in the same way.Mind over massesThere are two techniques of mass manipulation that people need to understandifthey are to begin to see through the game. One 1 call\"problem-reaction-solution\"and the other 1 term the \"stepping-stones approach”.These have been used forthousands of years to advance the agenda and, togetherwith fear, they remain thetwo most effective weapons of the Illuminati. Thefirst technique works like this:you know that if you openly propose to removebasic freedoms, start a war, orcentralise power, there will be a public reactionagainst it. So you use problem-Children of the Matrixreaction-solution. At stage one you create a problem. It could be a countryattackinganother, a government or economic collapse, or a terrorist bomb.Anything in factthat the public will think requires a \"solution\". At stage two,you report the\"problems\" you have covertly created in the way you wish thepeople to perceivethem. You find someone to blame, a patsy like Timothy McVeighin Oklahoma, andyou spin the background to these events in a way that encouragesthe people todemand that \"something must be done\". These are the words you wishto hearbecause it allows you to move on to stage three, the sting. You thenopenly offer thesolutions to the problems you have yourself created. Thesesolutions, of course,involve the centralisation of power, the sacking ofofficials or politicians that aregetting in your way, and the removal of morebasic freedoms. With this techniqueyou can so manipulate the public mind thatthey will demand that you do what, innormal circumstances, they would vehementlyoppose. The Oklahoma bomb at theJames P. Murrah Building on April 19th 1995 wasa problem-reaction-solutionclassic. In ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, 1expose how McVeigh was set up byforces he did not understand and how a fuelfertiliser device in a Ryder truck couldnot possibly have caused that horrificdamage.'4 And what followed this death anddestruction? \"Anti-terrorism\" lawswent through Congress without challenge thatremoved fundamental freedoms fromAmerican people. 1 have no sympathy withthe political views of McVeigh and theChristian patriots in general, except to theextent that they seek to expose thebasics of the global agenda. But that's not thepoint. Establishing the truth ofwhat happened is the point, no matter what theviews and attitudes of thoseinvolved. 1 think it is called justice. If you arewondering why McVeigh offeredno defence and later asked to be executed, see thesection on mind control. Thetwo most effective problem-reaction-solutions in the20th century were the twoglobal wars. They changed the face of the world, as warsalways do, and led to amassive centralisation of power. The United Nations, like itspredecessor, theLeague of Nations, was an Illuminati creation to act as a Trojanhorse orstalking horse for world government.The media play their part to perfection in these \"P-R-S\" scenarios. Atownershiplevel, people like Conrad Black at the Hollinger Group know what isgoing on anduse their newspapers to pursue the Uluminati agenda. The key editorsthey appointmight know something of it and also certain columnists. But most ofthe journalistswill have no idea. The editor is always there to block anythingthey write that isagainst the interests of the Uluminati and if they insist onpursuing an unwelcomestory they find themselves looking for another job. And,anyway, most of whatjournalists write comes from official (Uluminati) sources.In the immediateaftermath of a major event such as Oklahoma, where are thereporters getting theirinformation? From official sources. We are told thatWhite House sources say thisand FBI sources say that. This is how the Uluminatitransmit through the media theversion of these events that they wish the publicto believe. These reports are blazedacross the front page of newspapers and thetop of radio and television newsbulletins throughout the world and what they saybecomes the \"norm\". In theweeks and months that follow, researchers who areinterested in the real truth beginTo the prison born9to dig away. Over and over they establish and document the proof of howtheofficial version was a lie from start to finish. Blit where are their reportspublished?In small-circulation newsletters and on radio stations that operatewith a fraction ofthe money and audience of the Illuminati empires. Years afterthe official versionhas been demolished it still prevails in the public mind.Stop people in London,New York, Cape Town, Sydney, anywhere, and ask them whathappened inOklahoma, the Second World War, or Kosovo. Every time they will giveyou theofficial story because that is the only one they have heard.The bedfellow of problem-reaction-solution is the stepping-stones approach.Youknow where you intend to lead people, but you realise that if you gave themthe truepicture you would, once again, face substantial opposition. So youtravel to yourdestination in little steps and each one is presented in isolationand as unconnectedto all the others. It is like a drip, drip, drip, to globalcentralisation. This techniquewas used most obviously with the fascistsuper-state now known as the EuropeanUnion. If the politicians had suggested acentralised Europe with common laws andcurrency there would have been an outcry.People would have said they had beenfighting Hitler to stop just such a Europeandictatorship and there was no way theywere accepting another. To overcome this,the Illuminati offered a \"free-trade area\"and even used the problem of theirmanipulated world wars to encourage more co-operation between the countries ofEurope. Once they had the free trade area,however, the foot in the door, theybegan to expand its powers until it became thefully fledged fascist politicaland economic dictatorship it is today. The same ishappening with NAFTA, theNorth American Free Trade Agreement, and APEC,Asia Pacific EconomicCo-operation, the \"free trade area\" for Asia and Australia.Look at today'snewspapers and television news bulletins and you'll seeproblem-reaction-solution and the stepping-stones technique played out day afterday. Oneextremely effective way to see through this scam is to keep askingyourself: \"Whobenefits from me believing this version of events or accepting thesolutions andchanges being offered as a result?\" The answer will be almost everytime: anyonewho wishes to centralise power and suppress more freedoms.Blind faithOver thousands of years, religion has best served this structure for humancontroland I will highlight later in this book the historical background andpresent-daymanipulation of these \"faiths\". But, in short, they have createdrigid belief systemsthat should never be questioned; imposed those beliefsthrough fear, indoctrination,isolation, and the mass genocide of non believers;and fought each other fordominance of the human mind, thus producing an orgasmof opportunity for theIlluminati to divide and rule for millennia. Anotherquestion. Is it more likely thatan Illuminati which has its origins in theancient past, long before these religionswere created, just happened to \"getlucky\" when such a perfect vehicle for humancontrol independently emerged? Or isit rather more probable that these institutionsof human enslavement werepurposely created by these very same Illuminati toadvance their agenda? Butreligion is not the conspiracy, and nor are economics,10Children of the Matrixpolitics, and all the rest. They are part of a vast web of interconnectedmanipulationdesigned to persuade the masses to put themselves in prison andthrow away thekey. The Illuminati work through every belief system - religious,political,economic, racial, and cultural - and through every side in the major\"debates\". Thereason is simple: If you want to know the outcome of a game beforethe game haseven started, you need to control all sides. The manager of afootball team cannotdictate the result if he only controls one side. If,however, he is managing both sides,he can decide the result before a ball iskicked. So it is with the Illuminati, thehidden hand behind the events thataffect our lives and our world every day.But, by the end of this book, if you are open-minded enough to complete it,thehand will be hidden no more. The truth is not only out there. A lot of it isright here.SOURCES1 Jim Shaw, The Deadly Deception (Huntington House Inc, Lafayette, Louisiana,1988), p1032 Morals And Dogma Of The Ancient And Accepted Scottish Rite Of Freemasonry, p8193 The Deadly Deception, pp 65 and 664 ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, pp 321 to 324CHAPTER2DesignerhistoryWho controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controlsthe past.George Orwell, 1984History is the lie commonly agreed upon.VoltaireTo know where you are and where you are going, it helps enormously to knowwhereyou have come from. Indeed it is essential. The fix we have today onwho we areand the nature of \"reality\" has been based to a very large extent on ourbeliefin what has happened in the past. So if you want to manipulate people'ssense ofself and reality today, it is vital to rewrite what we hilariouslycall\"history.” For example, if official history tells you from cradle to gravethat theSecond World War was fought between the good guys and bad guys, theAlliesfighting for freedom and the fascists seeking a global dictatorship, youdo notopen your eyes to see the endless provable evidence that both \"sides\"werefunded and controlled by the same people operating through Wall Street andtheCity of London.The story of \"Jesus\" is another outstanding case, probably the best. TheChristianreligion is based entirely on belief in the historical, literal,existence, of a Jewish manwho was born to a virgin mother, performed countless\"miracles\", died on a crossto save us all, disappeared from his tomb after threedays, and then ascended toheaven to be with his dad. Over the best part of 2,000years, billions of lives on thisplanet have been controlled, limited,manipulated and directed by a belief that theJesus story actually happened.Still today, vast swathes of humanity are obsessedwith, and their every actionbased upon, this fairy tale being historically accurate.Just one story about one\"man\" has had that staggering scale of humanconsequence, ancient and modem. Andyet, as we shall see, the Gospels arenonsense if taken literally, with nohistorical foundation whatsoever. They aremerely the most exploited versions ofa symbolic, not literal, story that you findall over the world in all its detailthousands of years before the name \"Jesus\"was first mentioned.12Children of the MatrixA little quiz. Who am I talking about here?He was born on December 25th to a virgin mother; he was called a saviour,theonly begotten son, and died to save humanity; he was crucified on a Friday-\"Black Friday\" - and his blood was spilled to redeem the Earth; he suffereddeathwith nails and stakes; he was the Father and Son combined in an earthlybody; hewas put in a tomb, went down into the underworld, but three days later,on March25th, his body was found to be gone from the tomb and he was resurrectedas the\"Most High God\"; his body was symbolised as bread and eaten by thosewhoworshipped him.'Jesus, yes? No, no. All of this was said about the saviour Son of God calledAttiswho was worshipped by the Phrygians, one of the oldest races in Asia Minor,nowTurkey, well over a thousand years before the manufacture of \"Jesus\". It isjust oneof countless symbolic deities of whom the same story was told millenniabeforeChristianity. Others are accepted to have been myths and not to haveliterallyexisted. But not Jesus. While Christians laugh at those \"Pagan\" talesand condemnthem as evil, they ask the rest of the world to believe, indeed haveinsisted on painof torture and death, that their version of the same story issomehow literally truewhile all the others are not. Yeah, right.To understand how the repeat of an ancient, endlessly recurring story couldbetransformed into the prison-religion called Christianity, and to see thesource ofglobal control today, we have to research our ancient origins. When wedo that withan open mind and without preconceived dogma, a very different humanhistoryemerges. One that is not taught in the schools and universities of theworld orrevealed through the mainstream media. It is a story that not only makessense ofthe past, but opens your eyes to the staggering scale of manipulationtoday and theancient background and ancestry of those involved. Contrary toconditioned belief,life on Fai th has not evolved from a primitive past to thetechnological \"cuttingedge\" of today. Many thousands of years ago, as detailedin streams of ancientaccounts across the world, there was great technologicalknowledge on this planetand a global society controlled by races of beings,which humans came to know as\"gods\". It is a minefield to decipher which of thesegods were flesh and blood real,and which were symbolic of the Sun, Moon,planets, natural cycles, and so on. Mostwere the latter, but there issubstantial evidence to confirm that some of them,particularly the further backyou go, were walking, talking, entities, who had, byhuman standards at the time,amazing knowledge of the solar system, the stars, theuniversal cycles, theeffect of the Sun, Moon and other planets and star systems onthe Earth and itspeople, and technological understanding of such immensity thatthey were able tobuild the pyramids and other stunning structures all over theworld that we wouldstruggle to build even today.Just consider the scale we are talking here with the Giza Pyramids alone.TheGreat Pyramid, which is nearly 500 feet high, consists of six and a halfmillion tonsof stone and around two and a half million individual blocks. Someweigh 70 tonsand in the other pyramids and walls are stones of 200, even 468tons, and they areso perfectly cut and fitted together you could not get a pieceof paper between13them. There is enough stone in the Great Pyramid alone to build 30 EmpireStateBuildings and enough stone on the Giza site to build a wall around theentireborder of France some three metres high and one metre thick.2 Some ofthesegigantic stones at Giza and numerous temple sites were apparently takenfromquarries hundreds of miles away. And we are told that \"primitive\" people didthis?Oh do come on. At Baalbeck in the Lebanon are structures thousands of yearsold,which include three enormous chunks of stone known as the Trilithon,eachweighing more than 800 tons. These had to be moved at least a third of amile andone of them placed 20 feet up in a wall.3 Another piece of stone nearbyis athousand tons, which, apparently, is the weight of three Jumbo Jets.4 We areaskedto believe again that a \"primitive\" people did this. In Peru, you haveancienttemples and other sites built with stones weighing 440 tons and atTiahuanaco inPeru blocks weighing 100 tons are connected by metal clamps.5 Thissite is dated atsome 11,000 years ago.6 On the Nazca Plain in Peru there are themassive andastonishing Nazca Lines. These are fantastic depictions of birds,insects, andanimals, created by scoring away the top surface to reveal the whiterockunderneath. The images are made with one continuous line and some wereonlyseen in their entirety after 1939 when people began to fly over the regionbecausethey can only be seen in full from one thousand to 2,000 feet! Rockcarvings datingback more than 10,000 years were found during an expedition tothe Marca Huasiplateau northeast of Lima, Peru, and these included sculpturesrepresenting peopleand animals, most of which are not native to Peru. Theyincluded a polar bear,walrus, African lion, penguin and the stegosaurusdinosaur. But dinosaurs wereunknown to science until the 1880s, and thestegosauria was not identified until1901. Talk us through that one.As other books and television documentaries in recent years have shown,theseamazing structures, temples, stone circles, and standing stones, were notonly linedup precisely with certain star systems, they were aligned just asprecisely inrelationship to each other all over the planet, and the buildingtechniques anddesigns were often the same on different sides of the world. Why?Because theofficial version of history is baloney. There were not isolated,unconnected, societies,which developed alone, if you go back far enough. Therewas a global societycontrolled by the \"gods\" and representatives of the \"gods\" -beings that wereextremely advanced technologically compared with the mass ofhumanity at thetime and, in many ways, ahead of our society today. Or, at least,ahead of thetechnology we are allowed to see in the public arena, anyway. Aprecisely machinedand shaped cube of metal was found in the centre of a block ofcoal in Austria in1885 and, based on the age of that coal seam, it must havebeen made some 300,000years ago!7 A piece of gold thread was found embedded ineight feet of rock inRutherford Mills, England, in 1844, and that rock wasestimated to go back 60million years!!8 Electric batteries have been found inancient Egyptian tombs anda massive slab of green glass weighing many tons wasfound in Israel.9 The pre-historic bones of animals have been discovered withbullets in them.10 As the brilliantauthor and researcher of far ancient history.Colonel James Churchward, wrote:14Children of the Matrix\"Civilisations have been born and completed and then forgotten again andagain.There is nothing new under the Sun. What is, has been. All that we learnanddiscover has existed before; our inventions and discoveries are butreinventions,re-discoveries.\"11The ancients across the world described a high-tech \"Golden Age\" ofhumansociety, although some of it, especially towards the end, was anything,but\"golden\". These stories say that this age was ended by high-tech war and aseries ofgeological catastrophes that caused colossal Earth changes throughearthquakes,volcanic eruptions, magnetic pole shifts, and tidal waves on a scalewe could notbegin to imagine today. The Biblical Great Flood is a symbolic storyof one suchevent, but there appear from the biological and geological record tohave beenseveral from about 12.000BC up to around 5000BC, perhaps even later. Asyou cansee in The Biggest Secret, and the excellent book, The Day The EarthNearly Died, byD.S. Allen and J.B. Delair (Gateway Books, Bath, 1995), thegeological and biologicalevidence is supported by the ancient accounts with themost incrediblesynchronicity. Everywhere the ancients recorded the effects ofthese events.Professor James DeMeo writes in his book, Saharasia (HiddenMysteries, Texas,2000) of vast changes in the Middle East in this same \"window\"of time:\"A massive climate change shook the ancient world, when approximately 6,000yearsago vast areas of lush grassland and forest in the Old World began to quicklydryout and convert into harsh desert. The vast Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert,andthe giant deserts of the Middle East and Central Asia simply did not existprior to(about) 4,000bc..\".12The upheavals of the ancient world destroyed the advanced global societyor\"Golden Age\" that existed before and this is recorded in the stories ofAtlantis andLemuria, or \"Mu\". Humanity had to start all over again. If youbelieve that is far-fetched, think about today's society. It may be advanced onone level with powergrids and computer systems, and all the rest. Suchtechnology can performapparently miraculous feats, like typing a letter on tothis computer and having itread by someone on the other side of the worldseconds later. But what wouldhappen to this technological society if we werefaced now with a global catastrophethat devastated the planet? Within seconds,we would be sitting in the technologicalStone Age. It would be a primitive,everyone-for-themselves, find-your-own-food,shelter and warmth, free-for-all.And as time and generations passed, the memoryof the technological world we havetoday would fade, ever more rapidly, and onlybe preserved in stories and mythswhich would, more and more, be seen as wildtales and figments of theimagination. Most people would deny such a world everexisted because it would beso at odds with their daily experience. We would havethe samewe-can't-do-it-so-it-can't-be-done mentality that laughed at the very ideawecould fly to the Moon. The history in that post-cataclysmic society wouldonlybegin with the records left by humanity once they had re-advanced to acertain15level. Only then would they write or symbolise accounts of their history andthiswould be based on stories passed verbally through the earlier generations.Such apoint could take hundreds, even thousands, of years after the globalgeologicaldestruction. So it was after the cataclysms of our ancient past.Conventional\"history\" says that the \"cradle\" of civilisation was Sumer, in theland between theRivers Tigris and Euphrates in what we now call Iraq and onceknown asMesopotamia (\"Between Two Rivers\"). The Sumerian period is estimated tohavespanned the millennia between 4000 and 2000BC. Historians say thatother,independent, civilisations of great advancement also suddenly appeared inthesame period in Egypt and the Indus Valley in what is now the Indiancontinent. Butthey are wrong on both counts, I would suggest. Sumer was not thestart of what iscalled civilised society on this planet. It was the mostsignificant one to emerge afterthe catastrophe that destroyed the global societyof the \"Golden Age\" - Atlantis andLemuria, or Mu. Sumer was not the beginning;it was the start-over-again whichwas to become the centre of another virtuallyglobal empire. Indeed Sumer,Babylon, Egypt, and the Indus Valley civilisationshad actually begun tens ofthousands of years before history records them. Afterthe cataclysms, theseadvanced cultures in Egypt and the Indus Valley, which\"suddenly\" andunexplainably manifested at a very high level of development, werenotindependent of Sumer, as the historians claim. They were part of the sameSumerEmpire and ruled by the same leader. The structure of administration,thefoundation of law, building techniques, and so many other features of what wecallmodern society, can be traced back to this ancient race that founded Sumer.Or moreto the point, to those ruling bloodlines and \"gods\" that held theknowledge goingback into pre-history. These advanced ancient post-delugesocieties appeared withtremendous speed. Professor W.B. Emery writes in ArchaicEgypt (Penguin Books,England, 1961):\"At a period approximately 3400 years (bc), a great change took place in Egypt,andthe country passed rapidly from a state of advanced Neolithic culture with acomplextribal character to two well-organised monarchies, one comprising theDelta area andthe other the Nile Valley proper. At the same time the art ofwriting appears.Monumental architecture and the arts and crafts developed to anastonishing degree,and all the evidence points to the existence of awell-organised, even luxuriouscivilisation. All this was achieved within acomparatively short period of time, for thereappears to be little or nobackground to these fundamental developments in writingand architecture.\"13The question still to be answered is whether the incredible feats of buildinglikethe pyramids originate before the great cataclysms, which destroyed thelegendaryGolden Age (in other words, maybe upwards of 10,000 years ago and farlonger), orwere they built by the Sumer Empire which emerged when the world hadagainreached an advanced level of society after the upheavals. I have no doubtthat itwas a mixture of both. In the light of the rapidly emerging evidence, andthe16Children of the Matrixfundamental re-assessment of timescales in the wake of that evidence, at leastsomeof the world's greatest ancient wonders go back to the pre-cataclysmicglobalsociety known in legends and accounts as the Golden Age. They are far,far, olderthan previously imagined. Inca accounts, compiled by FernandoMontesinos, one ofthe earliest Spanish chroniclers in South America, say therewere two Inca Empires.The first established their headquarters at Cuzco in theAndes Mountains and, afterthey fled to a mountain-top sanctuary (Machu Picchu?)in the wake of devastatingland upheavals, they returned to Cuzco to start asecond culture. This would pushback the original Inca Empire to the time of theAtlantean-Lemurian cataclysms andbefore, and lead us to the true builders of thefantastic structures that conventionalhistory cannot explain.All over the world in every native culture, you will find stories of a greatfloodand incredible geological upheavals. There is no doubt that anunimaginablecatastrophe or, more likely, catastrophes were visited upon theEarth betweenapproximately 11000 and 5000BC. The geological and biologicalevidence isoverwhelming in support of the countless stories and traditions thatdescribe suchevents. They come from Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Africa,throughout theAmericas, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, China, Japan, and theMiddle East.Everywhere. Some speak of great heat that boiled the sea; ofmountains breathingfire; the disappearance of the Sun and Moon and the darknessthat followed; theraining down of blood, ice, and rock; the Earth flipping over;the sky falling; therising and sinking of land; the loss of great continents;the coming of the ice; andvirtually all of them describe a fantastic flood, awall of water, which swept acrossthe Earth. The tidal wave caused by the cometin the movie, Deep Impact, gives youan idea of what it would have been like. OldChinese texts describe how the pillarssupporting the sky crumbled; of how theSun, Moon, and stars poured down in thenorth-west, where the sky became low;rivers, seas, and oceans, rushed to thesouth-east where the Earth sank and agreat conflagration was quenched by araging flood. In America, the PawneeIndians tell the same story of a time when thenorth and south polar starschanged places and \"went to visit each other\". NorthAmerican traditions refer togreat clouds appearing and a heat so powerful that thewaters boiled. TheGreenland Eskimos told early missionaries that long ago theEarth turned over.Peruvian legends say that the Andes Mountains were rippedapart when the sky madewar with the Earth. Brazilian myth describes how theheavens burst and fragmentsfell down killing everything and everyone as heavenand Earth changed places. Andthe Hopi Indians of North America record that:\"The Earth was rent in greatchasms, and water covered everything except onenarrow ridge of mud.\"14Atlantis and LemuriaAll of this closely correlates with the legends of Atlantis and Lemuria, or Mu.Thesewere two vast continents, one in the Atlantic and the other in the Pacific,whichmany people believe were ruled by highly advanced races that originatedfromother worlds. The continents are said to have disappeared under the sea inthe17circumstances described above, leaving only islands, like the Azores andPolynesia,as remnants of their former scale and glory. Atlantis is said by someto haveemerged after the sinking of Lemuria. Others say they were simultaneousand that'smy view. The most thorough and outstanding researcher of Lemuria-MuwasColonel James Churchward, who wrote a series of books in the first half ofthe 20thcentury. Churchward visited remote monasteries in Asia and saw theancientrecords of the \"Motherland\" of Mu or Lemuria going back between 12,000and70,000 years. He saw how it was the centre of a global empire thatincludedAtlantis. In his book, The Children Of Mu (BE Books, Albuquerque, NewMexico),first published in 1931, he shows how the various racial types on Mu,includingblue-eyed blonds, peopled the world.15 These Lemurian races went eastto becomethe Mayans of Central America and the other builders of the fantasticstructures ofthe American continent. They went west to people Asia, China,India, andelsewhere, and created colonies in what became Egypt and Sumer. Allgenetic andcultural roads, he says, lead back to Lemuria-Mu, the \"Motherland\",and the veryadvanced civilisation that existed tens of thousands, possiblyhundreds ofthousands, of years before today's \"modern\" society. Churchward saysthatLemuria was destroyed around 12,000 years ago. W.T. Samsel in his studyofthese ancient societies, The Atlantis Connection (Starfire Publishing,Sedona,Arizona, 1998), dates the end of Lemuria much earlier, but many of theirbasicthemes are similar.Samsel's book is based on \"channelled\" information. Creation consists ofaninfinite number of wavelengths or frequencies and the world we perceive withourphysical senses is merely one tiny fraction of the frequencies that exist.Just as wecannot see the radio and television frequencies sharing the same spaceas our bodiesat this moment, so we cannot see with our limited physical sensesthe otherfrequencies and wavelengths of Creation that also occupy the same spacethat wedo. I will go into greater detail about this later because it is crucialto understandinghow we are controlled and how we can break free. But to\"channel\" is to \"tune\" ourconsciousness to some of these other wavelengths andaccess the knowledge andinformation that exists there. Samsel claims to be incontact with an entity formerlyincarnate in Atlantis that now communicates fromone of these other frequencies.Most channelled information, in my experience, iseither nonsense or extremelylimited, but many of Samsel's themes are supportedby geological and biologicalrecord. He believes that it was about 100,000 yearsago that the first examples ofmodern human forms appeared on the island ofLemuria in what is now the PacificOcean.16 These were intended to be \"perfectedvehicles”, he says. As they began toexplore the Earth, they seeded the land thatis known as Atlantis, which is said tohave been in the Atlantic on thegeologically unstable mid-Atlantic Ridge. Samselsays that early Atlanteans werea dark-skinned people, not unlike the NativeAmericans. He believes the NativeAmerican people are directly descended fromLemurians and Atlanteans who settledin the Americas before the first greatcataclysm some 48,000 years ago and NativeAmerican legends support thistheme.17 His view is that in those earlier days ofAtlantis and Lemuria the people18Children of the Matrixlived under the \"Law of One\", the understanding that everything is thesameenergy expressing itself in different forms. The Law of One is the knowledgethateverything is connected to everything else and ultimately all is anexpression of thesame whole or energy. Scientists call this the unified fieldtheory. This is a commontheme of Atlantean myths and legends - a civilisationthat began with positiveintent and in harmony with the natural laws, but wastaken over by forces thattransformed it into a very dark place indeed. Samselsuggests that the \"warbetween the gods\" in ancient mythology, was a war betweenextraterrestrial racesover the question of intervention or non-intervention inEarth affairs. He says thatmidway through the early Atlantian age,extraterrestrials with a human-likeappearance - \"very tall, light haired, lightskinned, albino-like people\" - madecontact with the Atlanteans.18 They began tomanipulate Atlantean society, he says,and interbreed with humans to change theDNA and create hybrid bloodlines thatbecame the royal lineage of kings andqueens. I would include Lemuria in this samestory also. The technology andphysical appearance of these extraterrestrials led theAtlanteans/Lemurians tosee them as gods. Intermarrying with these beings toproduce light-skinnedoffspring with \"god-like features\" became the goal of manyAtlanteans, Samselwrites, and these crossbreeds became the dominant force. Theytook over thegovernment, economics, education, religion, and communications.Sound familiar?Samsel says that the kings of the white royal lineage ruled Atlantisand what hecalls the \"Sons of Belial\" controlled the Temple of the Sun, theirreligioushierarchy and ritual network. Today this Atlantean Temple of the Sun isknown asthe Illuminati. During this period, many Atlanteans of the red racemigrated westto the Americas, which were then geographically different to whatwe see today.Samsel goes on:\"The age of the Atlantic Empire would prove to be a free-for-all for the Sons ofBelialand the followers of the Temple of the Sun. The dominant white tribe cameto rule allaspects of Atlantean society. They disregarded the Law of One, placedtheir faith intechnology and were driven by greed and the lust for power. Thearms of the AtlanticEmpire came to stretch nearly worldwide. The Americas andAfrica, the Europeancountries, the Middle East, India and Tibet came under thecontrol of the Empire. TheOne Temple was divided and ineffective, the Sun Templeflourished and the Sons ofBelial prospered. During that time, One Law priestswere leading migrations of thered race west to the Americas and east to Africa.They sought to preserve the Law ofOne and so they built new circles in the farlands\".19Samsel says that the second great cataclysm brought an end to Atlantis.Hebelieves that they used their \"super weapons\" against what we now call Chinaandthey tried to \"utilize the Earth as a great conductor through which to directat theiradversaries\" using the vast crystal, which is a common theme inAtlantean stories.But, he says, the \"Earth hurled the force back upon them\" andthe final, disastrous,cataclysm was triggered.20 Samsel claims that the whiterace is the force behindglobal control:\"Throughout the history of the Earth and mankind, it has been the white tribethathas consistently exhibited the characteristics of their ancestral heritage.It is thesewho openly display many of the characteristics of other-worldly or'alien beings'. Theyhave embraced technology above spirituality and havemanipulated spirituality toachieve their own ends. They traditionally displaylittle regard for the Earth, nature orother species of living creatures.Throughout recorded history they have soughtdomination over all others and overthe Earth itself. They have been highlyprogrammed and conditioned to beexclusive, aggressive and dominating. Presently,these lead humanity towards theNew World Order, consciously or unconsciouslycarrying out the agenda of theIlluminati, hence, the extraterrestrial manipulators.\"21The themes of Samsel's research are supported by my own, although we differindetail. My own view is that what he calls the \"Sons of Belial\" are what I callthereptilian bloodlines, the result of interbreeding between the white or\"Nordic\" raceand a reptilian people. In the end, however, it's the theme thatreally matters inunderstanding the basic background to the world today. Thetussle between theAtlantean advocates of the Law of One and the opposing Templeof the Sun ishighly significant. The Temple of the Sun has been the religion ofthe Illuminatifrom Atlantis/Lemuria right through to the present time. In fact,today's world isthe new Atlantis, a mirror of the obsession with technologicaldominance that led tothe destruction of the first Atlantean civilisation. Putsimply, the Law of One seeseverything as connected, part of the same unifiedwhole, and the Temple of the Sunrepresents the desire to present everything asunconnected and isolated fromeverything else. One seeks to unite, the other todivide and, therefore, rule. You willsee this theme throughout the book as Itell the story of how the Illuminati, theAtlantean \"Sons of Belial\" or whateveryou would like to call them, have soughtto build the new Atlantis ever since thecataclysmic events that destroyed theoriginal version.Atlantis was described by Plato (427-347BC), the ancient Greek philosopher.Hewas also a high initiate of the secret society - Mystery school network. Tothis daythis secret network has passed on advanced knowledge to the chosen fewwhiledenying that privilege to the mass of the people. Official historydismisses Plato'scontention that such a continent existed, but there is vastgeological support forsuch claims. The Azores, which some believe were part ofAtlantis, lie on the mid-Atlantic ridge, a fracture line that encircles theplanet. This line continues for adistance of 40,000 miles.22 The mid-Atlanticridge is one of the foremost areas forearthquakes and volcanoes. Four vasttectonic plates, the Eurasian, African, NorthAmerican, and Caribbean, all meetand collide in this region making it veryunstable geologically. Both the Azoresand the Canary Islands (named after dogs,\"Canine\", and not canaries!) weresubject to widespread volcanic activity in thetime period Plato suggested forthe end of Atlantis. Tachylite lava disintegrates inseawater within 15,000 yearsand yet it is still found on the seabed around theAzores, confirminggeologically recent upheavals.23 Other evidence, including beachsand gatheredfrom depths of 10,500 - 18,440 feet, reveals that the seabed in this20Children of the Matrixregion must have been, again geologically recently, above sea level.24Theoceanographer, Maurice Ewing, wrote in National Geographic Magazine,that:\"Either the land must have sunk two or three miles or the sea must oncehave beentwo or three miles lower than now. Either conclusion is startling.\"23When Europeanexplorers first landed in the Canary Islands the people said theywere descendantsof the Atlanteans and were shocked to realise that other peoplehad survived thecataclysm that destroyed their homeland.The geological and biological evidence also suggests that the widespreadvolcanicactivity that caused the sinking of the land in the region of the Azoreshappenedat the same time as the break up and sinking of the land mass knownasAppalachia, which connected what we now call Europe, North America, IcelandandGreenland.26 Even their degree of submergence appears to be closely related.Theso-called Bermuda Triangle, between Bermuda, southern Florida, and a pointnearthe Antilles, has long been associated with Atlantis. It is an area steepedinlegends of disappearing ships and aircraft. Submerged buildings, walls, roads,andstone circles like Stonehenge, even what appear to be pyramids, have beenlocatednear Bimini under the waters of the Bahama Banks and within the\"triangle\".27 Sohave walls or roads creating intersecting lines. Some otherfacts that most peopledon't know: the Himalayas, Alps, Andes, and at least mostother mountain ranges,were only formed or reached anything like their presentheight around 12,000 yearsago.28 Lake Titicaca on the Peru-Bolivia border istoday the highest navigable lake inthe world at some 12,500 feet. Around 11,000years ago, much of that region was atsea level.29 Why are so many fish and otherocean fossils found high up in mountainranges? Because those rocks were once atsea level and recently so in geologicalterms, too. How interesting then thatPlato dated the cataclysm that destroyed thecontinent of Atlantis to around9000BC and so do Allan and Delair in their superbwork. When The Earth NearlyDied. They say it happened around 9500BC.The American researcher Charles Hapgood claimed that the surface of the Earthhadmoved by some 3,000 miles around lOOOOBC.'\" Rocks that contain iron act likeacompass. As the molten rock cools, the molecules align with the North Poleandeven if those rocks are moved they continue to hold that connection. ThisallowedHapgood to establish that before about 10000BC the physical North Polehad beenlocated on the land in the region occupied today by the Hudson Bay inCanada.\"But something happened around that time that moved the whole surface oftheEarth 3,000 miles to the south, thus relocating the land of the then NorthPole to theHudson Bay area. This is not as fantastic as it at first sounds. Theland surface, orcrust, of the planet, is only about 40 miles thick. It has beenlikened to the skin of anorange resting on a sea of molten lava. If a meteor oranother major body impactedthe Earth it could cause the crust to slide and,according to writer and researcher,Colin Wilson, there is geological evidencethat this has happened three times in thelast 100,000 years.'2 Measurements ofthe Earth's magnetic field have shown that thenorth and south magnetic poleshave changed places at least 171 times in the past76 million years and imaginethe effect of a magnetic pole shift on the weatheralone.\" The Canadian writer,Rand Flem-Ath, who has spent more than 20 years21researching these subjects, is convinced that at least a large proportion ofAtlantisis what we now call Antarctica because of this 3,000-mile shift to thesouth.34Hapgood, following up the work of Captain Arlington H. Mallery,studiedhundreds of maps found in the Library of Congress in Washington DC,whichprove that the world was mapped thousands of years ago with great accuracy.One,made by Oronteus Finnaeus in 1531, shows Antarctica with running rivers andice-free mountains.3' The famous map, drawn by the Turkish sailor, Piri Reis, in1513,and found at the palace of the Sultan of Constantinople in 1929, charts theSouthAmerican coast with great accuracy and part of the coast of Antarcticabefore it wascovered with ice two miles thick some 7,000 years ago! YetAntarctica was not\"discovered\" officially until Captain Cook arrived there in1773 and it was notexplored in detail until the 1950s. Some of the mountainranges in the Piri Reis mapwere not even found until 1952. Reis said that hecompiled his map from 20 olderones. Flem-Ath has also found astonishing evidenceto support the existence of ahighly advanced society thousands of years ago. Hefound that if you draw a line oflongitude through the Great Pyramid at Giza itcrosses more land than anywhereelse on the planet and this supports the ancientEgyptian belief that the pyramidwas the centre of the Earth.36 Flem-Ath thenrealised that if the Great Pyramid istaken to be the centre of the 0 degreemeridian, the longitude and latitude locationsof the world's sacred sites fittogether in neat geometrical patterns. They appearedas a grid system, very muchlike the blocks in the street plans of US cities.37 Hefound he could predictwhere a sacred site would be purely from this system. ’8 Thisgeometricalperfection is not the case if you take the present GreenwichObservatory inLondon to be the 0 degree central point. It throws the whole systemout.Greenwich was chosen by a committee only in 1884 despite protests byoneprominent member, the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth,thatthe 0 degree meridian should run through the Great Pyramid. Flem-Ath hasfurtherestablished that some 50 sacred sites in Mexico are aligned to a NorthPole locatedin the Hudson Bay area, as it was before the cataclysm.39 Even thosebuilt since theupheavals have been placed on older sites that aligned with theold North Pole. Thesame is true of Rosslyn Chapel near Edinburgh in Scotland.40This is an Illuminati\"Holy Grail\" full of their ancient symbolism and built bythe St Clair-Sinclair family,one of the foremost of the Illuminati bloodlinesand one of the founding forcesbehind the Knights Templar secret society. CharlesHapgood, incidentally, had ameeting arranged with President Kennedy to discuss aproject to find Atlantis, butKennedy died in Dallas a few days before theirappointment.41 Hapgood also toldRand Flem-Ath that he was going to produceevidence in his next book of anadvanced civilisation on Earth 100,000 years ago.But Hapgood died soonafterwards and the book was never written. James Churchwardhowever, producessuch evidence in his books and he tells how he saw maps ofSouth America andelsewhere in those remote Asian monasteries going back tens ofthousands of years.This evidence supports the view that the continent known as Mu or Lemurianowrests on the bed of the Pacific. The Polynesian tribes and other relatedpeoplesretain many legends of their sunken land of origin and Easter Islandnatives in the22Children of the MatrixPacific claim their land was once part of a continent destroyed by cataclysm.42AChinese text found in a Buddhist cave called Dunhuang in western China in1900included fragments of a map that featured an Island continent in thePacific.43 SouthAmerican legend tells the same story of their ancestors arrivingfrom a lostcontinent, among them a guy called Aramu Muru, who carried theknowledge ofthe Lemurian Brotherhood or Mystery school.44 The Hopi tribe inArizonaremember Lemuria as a series of islands by which they travelled to theAmericancontinent.43 Why isn't the story of the Atlantis and Mu a key part ofofficial history?Because the knowledge has been systematically suppressed anddestroyed. Theastronomer, Carl Sagan, said that a text detailing Atlantis,called The True History ofMankind Over the Last 100,000 Years, was destroyedwith thousands of others whenthe great library of Alexandria in Egypt wasdestroyed in AD391.46 Once we knowof these advanced civilisations that lastedhundreds of thousands of years, and theextraterrestrial involvement in theircreation and demise, our whole view of theworld and ourselves will change. Sowill our understanding of what is happeningand who is controlling us today. Thedestruction of ancient knowledge all over theworld in the name of Christianitywas the Illuminati, or the Temple of the Sun,destroying the true accounts, notonly of history, but also the Law of One.So what happened to Mars?There is increasing acceptance that the Earth has suffered some colossalgeologicalupheavals. The debate (and often hostility) comes with the question ofwhen andwhy. These upheavals have obviously involved the solar system as awholebecause every planet shows evidence of some cataclysmic events, whichhaveaffected its surface, atmosphere, speed, and angle of orbit or rotation.Thedestruction of Mars and its relationship with this devastation on Earth is asubjectoccupying the minds of many researchers. There has been a much greaterfocus onMars since the various space probes have been directed there and, ofcourse, theirrather unfortunate record of being lost or suffering \"technicalproblems\", whichprevent them sending pictures back to us. Mmmm. These \"failures”are theresponsibility of the Illuminati-created and controlled NASA operation.Thefailures followed the photographs taken in an area of Mars called Cydoniathatappeared to show non-natural rock formations. These included the famous\"face\"on Mars and various pyramids. The best-known writer and researcher onthissubject is the American, Richard Hoagland, a science journalist and aformeradviser at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.47 One of his team claimsto havecompared the relationship of the \"non-natural\" phenomena at Cydonia onMars,such as the face and the pyramids, with the layout at Avebury inWiltshire,England, with its stone circle, standing stone rows, Silbury Hill (thebiggesthuman-made mound in Europe), and other ancient earthworks. He says hefoundthat they are virtual mirrors of each other. The Giza plateau in Egypt,home of theGreat Pyramid, was formerly known as El-Kahira.48 This derived fromthe Arabnoun, El-Kahir, their name for...Mars.49 Ancient texts reveal that themeasurementof time was much related to Mars, and March 15th, the Ides of March(Mars), was23a key date in their Mars-related calendar, as was October 26th. The first markedthestai't of spring and the second was the end of the year in the Celticcalendar. Thename Camelot in the symbolic King Arthur stories apparently meansMartianCity or City of Mars.50Of course, as we know, a connection between Mars and human society isimpossiblebecause Mars was destroyed millions of years ago. But was it? We onlythink itwas because that's what the official version tells us and over and over whenyoulook at the basis for such scientific \"fact\" you often find it is merelyanassumption or an opinion and not a provable \"fact\" at all. Just one example ofthiswas confirmed by Dr Frank Drake, the former chairman of the CornellUniversityastronomy department, when he said: \"We used to think of the universeas nothingmore than abundant fields of stars arranged in galaxies, but weunderestimated thevariety and quantity of matter in space by a factor of aboutone trillion. Whichmeans that we were about as wrong as we could be.\"51 Butuntil they accepted theywere wrong in the face of the evidence, they taughttheir monumental error asscientific fact. This is happening every day and themedia just repeat such nonsensebecause it must be true if a scientist says itis. There is a fast emerging alternativescenario that is pretty much inagreement with the official story, except in onecrucial area where they differfundamentally. They both agree that Mars once hadwater, vegetation, and anatmosphere, which could have supported life as we knowit. They both agree thatthis potentially human-friendly environment was destroyedby catastrophicgeological events. The only serious area of contention is when thatdisasteroccurred. Was it really millions of years ago, as official \"science\" contends,orwas it merely thousands of years ago, as the alternative researchers suggest,atimescale that would fit perfectly with the devastation of Atlantis andLemuria-Mu.The gathering evidence is that Mars was destroyed in the samecatastrophe, which,on Earth, brought an end to that \"Golden Age\". In the 1950s,the Russian-bornwriter and researcher, Immanuel Velikovsky, suggested in aseries of books that theplanet we now call Venus (then a vast comet-like body)was the cause of both thedemise of Mars and the near-demise of the Earth when itwas hurled through thesolar system.'Velikovsky was ridiculed and bitterlyattacked by the \"scientific\"establishment and so he must have been sayingsomething worth hearing. But histheme is now enjoying more and more sympathy.When the Mariner 9 mission tookpictures of Venus, many of Velikovsky’s earlierdescriptions were proved correct,including what appeared to be a comet-liketail. Mariner's pictures of Mars alsosupported some of his theories. He pointedout that ancient peoples depicted Venusas a very bright object trailing smokefollowing a very different orbit and trajectorythan we see today. The Chinese,Toltecs, and Mayans recorded this. The earlySumerian astronomical accounts didnot include Venus, but the later Chaldeans inthe same region did so. Theydescribed it as a \"bright torch in heaven\" that\"illuminates like the Sun\" and\"fills the entire heavens.\" One of the major problemsthat people have inencompassing ideas about the planet's past is that they judgepossibility ontheir present experience, which is a tiny, tiny, fraction of the Earth'shistory.As Velikovsky wrote:24Children of the Matrix\"Traditions about upheavals and catastrophes, found among all peoples aregenerallydiscredited because of the short-sighted belief that no forces couldhave shaped theworld in the past that are not at work also at the present time,a belief that is thevery foundation of modern geology and of the theory ofevolution.\"53Brian Desborough, a friend of mine in California, has had a life experiencethatmakes his opinion significant to anyone researching the material in thisbook. He isa scientist, an inventor of free-energy technology that couldtransform life on Earth,and has been researching the Iliuminati, their history,origin, and agenda, for morethan 30 years. This interest began when he set outto prove that Jesus really existed,but he soon found himself proving that hedidn't. The Christian scam led him intothe bigger scam, just as my initialinvestigation into the suppression of spiritual (notreligious) knowledge did forme. Brian is no New Age flyaway sitting in the clouds.He is afeet-on-the-ground, give-me-the-evidence, researcher and writer. In the1960s, heworked at the aircraft giant, Boeing, and he says that a group ofBoeingphysicists got together to launch a private study aimed at explaining themanyanomalies of the Earth and other planets of the solar system that could notbeexplained by normal physics. What they concluded was to presentstaggeringsupport for Velikovsky, although they differed on time scale by about3,000 years.They said that around 5000BC a huge body, now called Jupiter,careered through thesolar system. This threw the outer planets into disarray, soexplaining their presentanomalies of spin direction and speed. Jupiter crashedinto a planet that onceorbited between where Mars and Jupiter are today and thedebris from this planet,they said, can be seen as the otherwise unexplainedasteroid belt that occupies thespace between...Mars and Jupiter. I saw someinteresting \"channelled\" informationabout Mars in relation to the end ofAtlantis. It said that one of the three Atlanteancataclysms, which destroyed thecontinent in stages, happened around 10500BC, andwas caused by a close pass ofthe Earth by Mars, which has been knocked out of itsoriginal orbit. The sametheme keeps returning from many diverse sources and,somewhere within this, thedetailed truth is waiting for us. James Churchward hasa more earthly explanationfor the cataclysms. He says there are enormous \"gasbelts” and chambers under theEarth and when these \"blow\" on a vast scale, theland above is destroyed. He saysthese gas belts ran under both Lemuria/Mu andAtlantis. What caused thecataclysms is open to debate, but that they did happen isa statement of fact.A similar theme can be found in the tens of thousands of ancient claytabletsdiscovered in Mesopotamia in the mid-19th century. These tell the storiesand mythsof the Sumerian culture that emerged after one of these cataclysms thatsank whatwas left of Atlantis. Sumer dates from around 4000BC, but civilisationsexisted in thatregion, as James Churchward documents, for tens of thousands ofyears beforeSumer emerged. Central to these Sumerian accounts were the \"gods\"the Sumerianscalled the Anunna (\"Sons of An\"). Their later Semitic names wereAN.UNNAK.KI(\"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came\") and DIN.GIR (\"The RighteousOnes ofthe Blazing Rockets\"). They are best known as the Anunnaki and so I shalluse that25term in the book. The Anunnaki, as we shall see, were a reptilian race from thestars.The Sumerian tablets describe, according to the author and translator,ZechariahSitchin, a collision between the moons of a planet they called Nibiruand one orbitingbetween the present Jupiter and Mars.54 The debris from thisstupendous collision,Sitchin's translations say, created what the Sumerianscalled \"the Great BandBracelet\" - the asteroid belt. The Sumerian accountsdiffer in detail, but again thetheme is the same. In their version of theseevents, the Boeing physicists suggestedthat part of Jupiter broke away on impactwith another planet. This is the body wenow call Venus, they concluded. It wasprojected towards Mars, destroying theatmosphere and life on that planet (theMars Pathfinder Mission established thatMartian rocks lack sufficient erosion tohave been on the surface for more than 10,000years).55 After devastating Mars,the \"Venus\" comet was caught by the gravitationalpull of the Earth, they said.It made several orbits of the Earth, causing the tidalwave and devastation thatended the Golden Age, and hurled vast quantities ofionised ice at the poles. Itsmomentum then hurled it into its present orbit as \"Venus\"the planet.Synchronistically, the most ancient Mesopotamian and Central Americanrecordsdon't include Venus in their planetary accounts, but the later ones do, andtherewas a focus on Venus with human sacrifices made to it. The Biggest Secretgoesinto this whole story in greater detail and you will see that it explains somany\"mysteries\". These include the sudden freezing of mammoths standing up intheprocess of eating because the ice did not slowly develop, it arrived in aninstant. Theancient legends and myths of how the Golden Age ended are confirmedin everyway by the scientific explanation of the geological and environmentalaffects of this\"walk-about\" by Venus.Most important in relation to our story, these conclusions by peoplelikeVelikovsky, the Boeing physicists, and increasing numbers of otherresearcherstoday, bring the time scale for the end of life on Mars to within theperiod that sawthe end of Atlantis and Lemuria-Mu. Brian Desborough suggests,along with manyothers, including myself, that the Golden Age was the result ofmanyextraterrestrial and other dimensional races visiting the Earth andoperating openlyamong the human population in a long period of at least hundredsof thousands ofyears. He believes, like those Boeing physicists he knew andworked with, that theEarth was much closer to the Sun before these events andthat Mars orbited in thearea the Earth now resides. Two independent scientists,Dr C.J. Hyman and C.William Kinsman, suggested that the Earth once followed thepresent orbit of Venusand that Mars was located in the present Earth orbit.56Ancient legends say thatEarth days and years were once shorter than now andhumans lived for far longer.57If, as is claimed, the deep canyons on the Marssurface were caused by massivetorrents of water, there had to have been a warmerclimate there at one time becausetoday it is so cold that water would freezeimmediately and the vacuumatmosphere would make the water vaporise instantly.58The closer orbit to the Sun,Desborough says, would have demanded that the firstEarth races would have beenblack, with the pigmentation necessary to cope withthe fiercer rays of the Sun.Ancient skeletons found near Stonehenge and alongthe west coast of France have26Children of the Matrixthe nasal and spinal traits of many female Africans.59 Ancient artefacts,statues,and artistic depictions around the world also suggest there was anadvanced blackrace of the Negro type.The Sumerian tablets describe how the Anunnaki \"gods\" left the planet toescapethe devastation, even indicating that they had caused it.60 The only onesto survivethe catastrophe were the extraterrestrials with the technology andforesight, perhapsprior warning, who left before the stuff hit the fan, and thepeople who sheltereddeep underground or in the mountain ranges above the floodwater which,according to the Boeing study, could have reached heights of 10,000feet. The Earth isriddled with tunnels and caverns, natural and created, whichdate back into farancient times. Many of these have been located, including anunderground city thatcould house a population of thousands in Cappadocia,Turkey, one of the centres ofthe Phoenicians and the origin of George ofCappadocia, who later became St Georgeof England. Thirty-six underground citieshave been discovered in Cappadocia so farand some are huge complexes going downeight levels. The ventilation systems areso efficient that even eight floorsdown the air is still fresh. Thirty vast undergroundcities and tunnel complexeshave also been found near Derinkuya in Turkey, also. Itwas the floodwaters andthe need to survive them, which ensured that agriculture inthe post-flood worldbegan at altitudes above 10,000 feet and not, as you wouldexpect, in the fertileplains. A study by the botanist, Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov,revealed that the50,000 wild plants he examined from around the world originatedin only eightareas - all of them mountainous.61 In James Churchward's view thiswould havebeen because the mountains were formed during the cataclysms andtherefore manylowland areas were raised to a great height. According to ancientaccounts,supported by much other evidence, when the Earth had settled down afterthecataclysm, or cataclysms, the survivors began to return from the highmountainsnorth of Sumer in Turkey and Iran into the plains of Mesopotamia. Itwas in theTurkish mountains, on Mount Ararat, that the symbolic Noah's Ark cameto restwhen the waters receded, the Bible claims.62 The Sumerian tablets alsorelate how theAnunnaki \"gods\" returned to rebuild and restore their devastatedheartlands, andthe civilisation that emerged from this is known to history asSumer. I think,however, that many parts of the Sumerian Tablets are actuallyreferring to events onLemuria and Atlantis. Some researchers suggest thatremains of the Anunnaki's pre-flood cities can be found today under the PersianGulf, which became much widerand deeper after the upheavals.63 Depending on thelocation and the effects of thedevastation, some of the great structures of theGolden Age survived and can beseen to this day. These could be anything fromtens to hundreds of thousands ofyears old. Other famous sites and structureswere built or rebuilt by the Sumeriansfrom around 6,000 years ago. My feeling atthe moment is that Stonehenge andAvebury were among the latter, but notnecessarily the pyramids of the Giza plateau,and certainly not some of thebreathtaking structures of South America. Theydefinitely appear to be GoldenAge.You can read far more detailed evidence of these cataclysmic events inTheBiggest Secret and When The Earth Nearly Died, together with a list of otherbooks27focussing on this subject. Velikovsky's books are listed in the bibliography.Thereason this information has been so suppressed in the mainstream of\"science\",\"education\", and media, is because of the domino effect it would haveon humanperception. Have you seen those world record attempts for knocking downthemost dominoes? They line them up so that by pushing down the first one theyfallon each other and all of them go down. The system of control, the Matrix as1 call it,is like that. The Illuminati have to work furiously to keep everydomino in theiragenda from falling because when one goes they all start to go.The control of whatwe call \"history\" is one of their most crucial of these\"dominoes”. If we knew thatthere had been a highly developed technologicalsociety thousands of years ago,which came to an end with fantastic geologicalupheavals, we would see the worldin a very different light. The whole officialversion of human evolution wouldcrumble. We would ask who those people were?Where did they come from? Wheredid they get their knowledge and technology?Suddenly the mysteries of Egypt andSumer and the staggering structures left usby the ancients would be far lessmysterious. And if Egypt and Sumer were foundedwith this same advancedknowledge, it means that some of those pre-cataclysmicpeoples must havesurvived. So what has happened to their knowledge for thousandsof years andwhat happened to their bloodlines?Once you allow a hole in your dyke, the flood begins to pour through. This iswhythe Illuminati, through their vehicles of religion and, more latterly,\"science\", havemade a prime focus the suppression of all knowledge andinformation that wouldreveal the true story of human history. Once we see that,the mist begins to clear.SOURCESFor the people who have written to me asking for the meaning of \"Ibid\" in thesource lists,it means, in effect: \"same as above\".1 The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read, edited by Tim C.

As 1mentionedearlier, Creation consists of infinite dimensions of life vibrating atdifferentspeeds. Think of the frequencies of the countless radio and televisionstationsbroadcasting to your area now. They are all sharing the same space thatyour bodyis occupying. You can't see them and they can't see each other becausethey arevibrating to a different frequency. When you move the dial from one radiostationto another, the first station does not suddenly stop broadcasting becauseyou areno longer listening. It goes on broadcasting - existing - just as before.Theonly difference is that you are no longer tuned to its frequency. All theinfinitefrequencies of life and existence in all Creation are sharing the samespace. Mostpeople call these different frequency ranges \"dimensions\" and that'sfine becausepeople know what they mean. More accurately they are \"densities\"because theslower that energy vibrates the more dense and \"solid” it appears.The faster itvibrates the more ethereal and non-physical it seems to be.Eventually it isvibrating so quickly that it leaves the frequency range - thedensity - of ourphysical senses and we cease to see it. The frequency range wecan see 1 willcall the Third Density or Third Dimension. At the moment we aretuned to thisfrequency, the range of our physical senses, and so we can see itand touch it.When we \"die\" we leave this frequency range and our physical bodyand wecontinue our eternal journey elsewhere on another density or dimension.Ourconsciousness, the thinking, feeling us, is eternal. In the end allfrequencies andall expressions of life are the same energy. We are each other.This is the Law ofOne that the Illuminati Temple of the Sun has sought forthousands of years tosuppress. Some extraterrestrial and other-dimensionalbeings know how tochange their frequency so they can move between densities,appearing and\"disappearing\" as they move frequency, much like a radio dial. Thisis why30people have reported seeing entities \"disappear\" before their eyes. They havenot.in fact, \"disappeared\" at all. They have left the frequency range thatperson canaccess. It's the same with UFOs.We are not aloneThe three main physical forms from constellations, planets, and stars likeOrion,Sirius, the Pleiades, Mars, and the others I have mentioned, appear tohave been:the white race or the \"blue-eyed blonds\"; a reptilian race of variousexpressions;and the so-called \"greys\" of modern UFO folklore (see picturesection). Also therewas the advanced black race and another, which, according tothose who claim tohave been abducted by non-human entities, has an insect-likeform. In UFOresearch these have become known as insectoids. 1 can understand howdifficultthis will be to accept and comprehend from the conditioned view ofreality. But firstof all 1 am not asking anyone to accept anything that 1 say -it's just information,make of it what you will - and, second, the world isnothing like our conditionedview of reality. I would also stress that, like allof my books and talks, this text ispresented in layers, each one adding to theones before. So the detailed informationto support the existence of thereptilians, greys, and Nordics, and theirinterbreeding, will be revealed as thestory unfolds. Understanding the connectionbetween the Nordics, the reptilians,and the greys is to understand so much aboutthe world today. W.T. Samsel, authorof The Atlantean Connection, writes:\"During the first half of the Lemurian age, the involvement of extraterrestrialbeingswas simply in the role of the observers. That is to say that they did notintervene,interject or become involved with the subjects of their study at thatpoint in time. Thedevelopment and progression of the human race on Earth wasunder the observationand study of these relations from the stars. In 'TheAtlantis Connection' I refer to thisas the 'Titan project'. The three mainextraterrestrial groups, which comprised theTitan project, were those fromSirius, the Pleiades and Orion, although there wereindeed other extraterrestrialraces, which also shared involvement. This is where thereptilian variety comesinto play. As where Sirians, Pleiadeans and those from Oriondid interact incooperation with each other under the mutually agreed upon conditionsof theprogram, I would have to classify the reptilians as a renegade or rebelelementwhich did not adhere to the 'rules' or doctrines of the Titan researchproject as setdown by the three main project participants.\"1These two races, the blue-eyed blonds and the reptilians, would seem to havebeenat war in many parts of the galaxy with factions on both sides alsojoiningtogether to create alliances for their mutual benefit. This reptilianrace is thedominating force behind the Illuminati (at one level anyway), butwith considerableinvolvement from the greys and some elements of theextraterrestrial white race or\"Nordics\" as they are known in UFO researchcircles. The rest of the globalpopulation are pawns in their battles andalliances. The reptilians and Nordicsinterbred with each other to create hybridbloodlines. There was also reptilian32Children of the Matrixinterbreeding with other races around the world, but the Nordic connectionwouldappear to be the most important to them.* This fusion implanted a reptiliangeneticcode into the DNA and these are the bloodlines that have ruled the worldforthousands of years and are still in the positions of power to this day, as weshall see.Bloodlines that were once Egyptian pharaohs and European royalty arenowpresidents of the United States, and leading bankers and media owners.Afundamental theme running from the \"Golden Age\" of Atlantis and Lemuria-Mutothe present day is that of the snake or serpent. Both civilisations were knowninlegends as the Dragon Lands and the Motherlands.2 The Greeks calledAtlantis\"Hespera\" (a name for Venus) and they said it was guarded by a dragon.3NativeAmerican records call Atlantis \"Itzamana\", which means \"Dragon Land\" orthe\"Old Red Land\".4 The Algonquins use the name Pan for the Atlantean continent,aname also given to the goat god of the Greeks. Pan was originally a dragon orgoatgod of the Atlanteans, some records of the early Egyptians and Greekssuggest.3The very name, Mu, pronounced Moo, is close to the Polynesian name forDragon.6An Indian Tamil text, Silappadikaran, describes a lost continent in thePacific andIndian Ocean it calls Kumari Nadu or Kumari Kandam, which means the\"DragonLand of the Immortal Serpents\".7You cannot be SiriusThese technologically advanced extraterrestrial and other-dimensionalbeingscreated Mystery schools and a secret society network in Atlantis andLemuria topass on levels of their knowledge to chosen initiates. Legends claimthat a race cameto the Earth from Sirius, the \"dog star\" and brightest in thesky, which is some8.7 light years from here. The term \"Dog Star\" comes from itsposition in theconstellation of Canis Major and it is also known as Orion'sDog.” The legends andaccounts say that the beings from Sirius brought aninfusion of highly advancedknowledge to Atlantis and Lemuria-Mu and founded theAtlantean MysterySchool. According to Robert Temple in The Sirius Mystery(Destiny Books, Vermont,USA, 1998), the Dogon tribe in Mali, Africa, claim thatbeings from Sirius visitedtheir ancestors and gave them knowledge of theuniverse. He says that theydescribe the Sirians as amphibious and\"serpent-featured\" - a recurring theme asyou will see. Temple suggests that theAnunnaki of the Sumerian tablets could bethese beings from Sirius. He furtherproposes that the body of the Sphinx is that of adog and not a lion, thussymbolising the Dog Star, Sirius,9 and some researchers alsosuggest that theface of the Sphinx is that of a woman, not a pharaoh. The Egyptianscertainlydepicted their lion bodies very differently to that of the Sphinx and thedog isa common symbol in ancient mythology.10 In fact, ancient Egyptians reveredthedog and their dog symbol was a code for Sirius.” The Sirius system wassymbolisedas feminine and so a dog's body with a woman's face would make* It is the reptilian bloodline that most concerns us in this book, but thereare others of extraterrestrialorigin, also. Cherokee and Mayan records in Northand Central America and the Greek historians,Appollodorius and Diodorus, areamong those that claim the Pleiadians, home to both the white raceandreptilians, were involved in Atlantis and mated with humans to seed a large raceof people.33sense, although there is still a case for it to be a lion, also. Sirius isconnected withthe colour red because it looks red when it appears over thehorizon.12 Red is thecolour used for Sirius in ritual and symbolism. For a longperiod of its existence, theSphinx was coloured red. It was an obviousconclusion that this could relatesymbolically to Mars, the \"red planet\", but inthe face of the other evidence, Sirius isperhaps more likely. The Queen's shaftin the Great Pyramid was designed to pointto Sirius, according to modernresearchers. Robert Temple presents a wealth ofinterconnecting evidence tosupport his belief that an amphibious race from Siriuscame to the Earth in farancient times and brought with them the knowledge thatfounded those advancedcivilisations. The Sirius system is also depicted as a snakeor serpent in aGreek representation in the Louvre Museum in Paris.13Temple's research began when he heard that the Dogon people in Mali, north-westAfrica, had told French researchers in 1931 some remarkable informationabout theSirius system. According to these researchers, the Dogon also knew aboutall theplanets of the solar system out to Pluto, and of moons that have onlyrecentlybeen confirmed. They said that a star orbited Sirius and it was so heavyall thepeople of the world could not lift it.14 At the time, the star they weretalking about,now called Sirius B, was not yet discovered by scientists. TheDogon are claimed tohave said that it took about 50 years to orbit Sirius A andthat it was \"infinitelytiny\".15 We now know this is true. Sirius B is a dwarfstar and fantastically heavy.The story goes that they said there was a thirdstar, which also orbits Sirius A, andtakes 50 years to complete a circuit. Againthis was undiscovered at the time, but itsexistence was confirmed by astronomersin 1995 and it is known as Sirius C.16 TheIlluminati symbolism of three - thetrinity - appears to be related, at least in part, tothese three stars of theSirius system. The constant reference to the number 50 inancient myth couldrelate to these 50-year orbits, Temple suggests, and they alsosymbolised SiriusB and C as \"the twins\" using their combined orbit periods of 100years as a codefor them, he says. Certainly there is endless reference to \"twin\"symbolismthroughout the ancient world. The Dogon call Sirius B, Digitaria, andSirius C,Sorghun, or the \"female star\".17 They also call it the \"sun of women\" or\"star ofwomen\".18 To them, the most important star is Sirius B, which, they rightlysaid,was invisible to the eye. Still today their religious rituals and rites arebased onthe cycles of the Sirius system. The Dog Star, Sirius or Sirius A, hastwo and a halftimes the mass of our own Sun and is thirty-five and a half timesbrighter.'\" Whenyou consider that our Sun contains 99% of the mass of this solarsystem, Sirius issome baby. Sirius B contains 1.053 times the mass of our Sun.2\"It is incrediblycompressed, however, and thus is very small.A focus on Sirius can be found at the heart of most ancient societies - andsecretsocieties. The heat in the summer months was believed to be, in part,caused bySirius and so they became known as \"dog days\". The Egyptian calendarwasregulated by the movement of Sirius (Sothis to the Greeks) and the Sothiccalendarwas founded on the rising of Sirius one minute before the Sun, theso-called heliacalrising in the Summer.\" The number 23 was important to theDogons, as it was to theEgyptians and the Babylonians. Some researchers say thiswas connected to the34Children of the Matrixheliacal rising on July 23rd when Sirius, the Earth, and the Sun are in astraight line.Others speculate that this could create a \"star gate\" connectionbetween the twosystems, a sort of interdimensional (inter-density) portal. Thismoment was thebeginning of the calendar for the new year in many cultures. It issaid that the eyesof the Sphinx (the dog?) line up with the exact period on thehorizon where Siriusrises on July 23rd and that the pyramids are also lined upto that point on thehorizon.” This, incidentally, is the time every year thatthe Illuminati elite gather atBohemian Grove in Northern California wearingtheir hooded robes for theirinfamous rituals under a 40-foot stone owl, asdetailed in The Biggest Secret. I willmention more about this later on. TheFreemasons and other secret societies withinthe Illuminati web have Sirius astheir focus. It is known as the Eastern Star - thevery name for the Freemasonic organisation thatallows women to becomeinitiates.23 Sirius is thefirst star to rise in the east in the latitudesofEgypt. The symbol of the Eastern Star is thesymbol of Satanism, the invertedpentagram,and that is their symbol for Sirius (Figure 2). Thepentagram within acircle is used by Satanists intheir rituals to draw other dimensionaldemonicentities into this world or to \"draw down theKingdom of Satan intomanifestation on Earth\",as one writer put it. The pentagram issymbolised by thegoat head known as the„ . ,, \"Goat of Mendes\" or \"Baphomet\", the imageclassic symbol of Satanism, and,the Knights Templar secret society wasaccusedapparently, a symbol for Sirius. of worshipping when it was purged inFranceafter 1307. The goat head is also associated withthe Sirius system. The ancientsdesigned massive temples to point directly at thespot on the horizon whereSirius appeared at the \"rising\" and their key rituals werefocused on Sirius,just as many of the Illuminati's are today. One example of theseSirius-alignedstructures is the Temple of Isis at Denderah in Egypt.24The goddess, Isis, is a symbol of Sirius in Egyptian myth. Robert Templesuggestsin The Sirius Mystery that Isis is Sirius and the \"sister-goddess\" ofIsis, Nephthys,represents Sirius B. Isis was said to be visible and Nephthysinvisible, just like SiriusA and B. Another Sirius symbol was Anubis (Anpu tothe Egyptians), the oneportrayed as the dog or jackal-headed god and associatedwith Osiris, the \"SunGod\" of Egypt.25 There was also a goddess called Anukis whosails in a celestial boatwith Sothis and Satis, again the three stars of Siriusperhaps because they areassociated with goddesses, and Sottis was the Greek termfor Sirius. The symbol ofthe dog or wolf is often found in cults that worshipthe serpent or reptilians. CredoMutwa, the Zulu shaman, says that their legendscall Sirius the \"Star of the Wolf\".The leader of the reptilian \"gods\" known asthe Anunnaki is named in the Sumeriantablets as An (later Anu). He wasrepresented by the jackal or dog. Associated withSirius in Egyptian belief wasOrion and, interestingly, modern UFO researchersPicture #2 [images/img_0002.png]35connect the reptilians with both Sirius and Orion. Isis (Sirius) was thecompanion ofOsiris (Orion?) in Egyptian myth. Among the major Illuminati symbolsto thepresent day are the eye, the triangle or pyramid, the five-pointed star,the obelisk,and the dome. The Egyptian hieroglyph for Sirius was the obelisk,dome and five-pointed star; the Bozo tribe of Mali, cousins to the Dogon, callSirius the \"Eye Star\";an Egyptian hieroglyph for Sirius was a triangle - threepoints representing the threeSirius stars; and the triangle symbolised water inPythagorean code;26 The eye was asymbol of Osiris in Egyptian myth. The bow andarrow is another symbol used bythe ancients for Sirius and they knew it as the\"bow star\". The Egyptian wordmeaning Bowman also referred to a \"heavy starmetal\" - Sirius B - and their wordfor heavy star metal was close to the wordsmeaning dwarf and weight.27 TheSumerian account called the Epic of Gilameshtells of a star that is so heavy it cannotbe lifted (Sirius B). This star wasassociated with An or Anu, the leader of theAnunnaki. The chief Egyptian god,Osiris, was also called An. In Sumerian accounts,An, the jackal-dog-headed god,had a daughter, the goddess Bau, the goddess of thedog. It has been suggestedthat Bau is the origin of the term \"bow wow\" for a dog'sbark.28 It certainlybears no resemblance to the sound a dog makes. In the Sumerianepic, Gilamesh isgiven 50 companions, which could be symbolic of the 50 years ittakes for SiriusB to orbit Sirius. What's for sure, the ancients perceived Sirius andSirius B asvery important to their lives.The Dogon are said to call these amphibious beings from Sirius, the Nommoor\"Masters of the Water\". The accounts of this extraterrestrial race arewidelysupported by ancient reports. The Sumerians claimed that strange beingsfrom thesea founded their civilisation. The historian, Alexander Polyhistor(born 105BC)wrote that these beings were amphibious and were happier to go backto the sea atnight.26 They are described as \"semi-demons\" (half human, half nothuman) andanimals endowed with reason.30 Other legends say that they weresuperhuman intheir knowledge and their length of life. They were \"the immortals\"and returned to\"the gods\" in a ship, taking with them examples of the Earth'sfauna. Interestingly,the Dogon call Sirius \"the Land of the Fish\" and \"the pureEarth\", and the day theNommo landed on our Earth is known as the \"day of thefish\".31 The Babylonianpriest Berossus wrote that the origin of humans inBabylonian belief could be tracedto the \"fish god\" Oannes, who was known asDagon to the Philistines. What theysaid about Oannes, the Sumerians said about\"Enki\", one of the key leaders of theirreptilian Anunnaki. Enki was symbolisedas closely connected with water and itwas said that he rode in a ship that couldgo under the water or fly in the sky. Hewas described as a giant who had scaleslike a fish or reptile. In the Babylonianlegend, Oannes was one of the\"Annedoti\" (\"the repulsive ones\") who had theheads and legs of men, but the bodyand tail of a fish.32 This is the origin of themermaid stories, no doubt. TheGreek gods known as the \"Old Men of the Sea\"Were depicted as \"mermen\". It wassaid that if you fought with them, they changedshape and the legendary foundersof Athens, Cecrops and his son, were said to behalf-human-half-serpentamphibians. The Greek god, Tython, was another half-man-half-serpent figure withmythological connections to Sirius, and both Isis and36Children of the MatrixOsiris were portayed with fish or serpent tails in some effigies. Poseidon oftheGreeks and Neptune of the Romans were symbols of the same theme.The Anunnaki (Annedoti) seem to be very connected to water and theirbloodlinesuse code names to this day that often relate to being \"of the water\". Themajorbloodline families appear to locate either in very hot regions, likeTexas,Arizona, Nevada, and California, or, more often, in cold damp places wherethere islots of water. The Netherlands is a major centre for them and that isone of thedampest countries in the world with much of it reclaimed from the sea.Also, thecold and damp castles and palaces of the aristocracy in Europe aretheir preferredhabitat. The recurrence of Anu, as in the Anunnaki (and An orAnu, their \"leader\"),is a common theme in ancient mythology. We have Anubis andAnukis, and in theancient Sanskrit language the word anu-pa means \"a waterycountry\".33 The ancientlegends and beliefs suggest that the Sirius system isvery watery with densevegetation - perfect for amphibians and the reptilianspecies. Chinese traditionsclaim that their civilisation was founded by anamphibious being called Fu-Hsi orFuxi in 3322BC. One description says he had aserpent's body and a man's head andhe is said to have begun the repopulation ofthe world after the deluge with anincestuous interbreeding with a charactercalled Nu Gua, who is also described ashalf human, half serpent. Another ancientChinese figure was Gong-Gong, who was\"a horned monster with the body of aserpent\". This sounds very much like Set ofthe Egyptians and Ogo in the myths ofthe Dogon. Other amphibious entities inChinese tradition are Emperor Yu (Yurelates to reptiles) and his father Gun (a namerelating to fish), and Chinesedrawings of their historical, mythological charactersare similar to those drawnby the Dogon.Today there are streams of reports across the world of people seeing UFOsflyingin and out of seas and lakes, not least at Lake Titicaca in Peru/Bolivia,the highestnavigable lake on Earth. The respected UFO researcher, Timothy Good,gives manyexamples of this phenomenon in his book, Unearthly Disclosure,(Century, UnitedKingdom, 2000). He calls these craft USOs, or UnidentifiedSubmergible Objects,and includes the accounts of witnesses who have seen themaround the world,especially in places like Lake Cote, Costa Rica, and themountainous El Yunquerainforest in Puerto Rico.34 The Dogon describe the arrivalof the Nommo in an\"ark\" that sounds very much like a spacecraft. Robert Templesays the Dogonindicate that the Nommo landed in the region of Egypt and describethetremendous noise and vibration when the \"ark\" landed, causing a whirlwindofdust. They say of the Nommo, a term they also use in the singular: \"He is likeaflame that went out when he touched the Earth.\" Dogon legend says the ship,or\"ark\", landed on three legs, Temple writes. A larger craft hovered intheatmosphere. The Nommo said that some of their number would be called\"thedisrupters\", and one would \"die on the cross\", the Dogon legends apparentlysay.35Peruvian creation myths tell of a great disk that came out of the sky andlanded onan island called the Island of the Sun. This is a place I have visitedtwice on theBolivian side of Lake Titicaca. During the Great Deluge, the top ofthis island wasthe first piece of land to emerge as the water receded, they say.There are sceptics37Picture #3 [images/img_0003.png]Picture #4 [images/img_0004.png]FidetityInvestmentsFigure 3: The classic Illuminati symbol ofthe all-seeing-eye and the pyramidwith thecapstone missing on the US dollar billFigures 4 and 5: The pyramid andall-seeing eye is used by a stream ofcompaniesin their advertising, includingR.J. Reynolds, a major Illuminatibloodline, andFidelity Investments...who seek to discredit the stories of the Dogon, the Nommo, and their tales ofSirius.They say the French researchers who first published the information hadsimplyinvented everything. But Credo Mutwa, the Zulu shaman and that nation'sofficialhistorian, says that his people have the same traditions. He says theycall Sirius the\"Star of the Wolf\" and their ancient accounts say that a\"sea-dwelling fish people\"from Sirius came to the Earth. They also speak of a\"gigantic war\" on Sirius inwhich the fish people drove out those who we now knowas humans. Credo furtherconfirms that the stories attributed to the Dogon arenot the only ancient records ofthe Sirius system. The Zulu's knew Sirius B asthe \"pit\" star long before it wasidentified by modern technology. Credo wrote inhis book, Song Of The Stars(Station Hill Openings, Barrytown, New York, 1996):\"Not only among the Zulu, but the Dogon, and many widespread African tribes,thereare stories of the Nommo, who resemble the king of the Water People in ourlegend.They are said to be intelligent beings who have visited the Earth severaltimes. Theyare usually described as somewhat like human beings, but with skinslike reptiles.I have heard them described as a cross between a little demon and a dolphin.\"36The translations of the Sumerian Tablets by Zecharia Sitchin claim thattheAnunnaki came from a planet called Nibiru, which, he says, has a vastellipticalorbit that takes it way out beyond Pluto and back between Mars andJupiter every3,600 years. The idea of Nibiru referring to a planet has neverfelt right to me.A massive comet, maybe. But either way there is a fundamentalconnectionbetween the reptilian Anunnaki of the Sumerian tablets andSirius-Orion.Researcher Mark Amaru Pinkham says in his book, The Return Of TheSerpents OfWisdom (Adventures Unlimited, Illinois, USA, 1997), that the symbolof the SiriansJ 37in Atlantis was a triangle, sometimes with an eye in the middle. Thispyramidwith the capstone missing and/or the all-seeing eye is an ancient symbolused bythe Illuminati and can be found today on the dollar bill, the reverse ofthe GreatSeal of the United States, and on a stream of logos used by Illuminaticompanies(Figures 3, 4 and 5). You also find it on the logo of the BritishIntelligence operation,Picture #5 [images/img_0005.png]38Children of the MatrixPicture #6 [images/img_0006.png]who would turn up later in theas Wotan and Wodan.MI5 (Figure 6). According to the story, the designfor the Great Seal was handedto the foundingfather and Rosicrucian, Thomas Jefferson, by amysterious strangerdressed in a cape with ahood that covered his face. After the end ofAtlantis thesurvivors took this symbol to placeslike Egypt and from there it continued to beusedby the Illuminati secret society network that re-emerged after thecataclysm. The three-prongedVtrident was the symbol of the royal line ofAtlantis and this later became the three-pointedI Fleur-de-lis, a symbol of theIlluminati bloodlineFigure 6: ...and here it is in the logo otto this day.

It was structuredas 13 schools(levels of initiation), they say, witheach one more advanced than the onebelow.40_. , , , , , This is the classic structure of secret societiesFigure 7: The symbol of the snake in thelogo of British Telecom, the UK's major throughout history.

You can see snake and serpent symbolism in thelogos ofIlluminati companies and the logo of the leading UK communicationsnetwork,British Telecom, is one example (Figure 7). Lemurian kings and queenswere 13th-level initiates of the \"Dragon Bloodline\", according to the LemurianFellowship. As Iwith the serpent cult or serpent brotherhood through the ages,the Lemurian initiatedwere worshippers of the Sun. But was it our Sun or was itSirius, the brightest star inthe sky? Records discovered in India by the leadingauthor and researcher onLemurian history. Colonel James Churchward, confirmedthis Sun worship. One ofLemuria's names, apparently, was \"The Empire of the Sun\"and the Sun symbols of Ithe Illuminati may also relate to that and the Atlantean\"Temple of the Sun\".41Atlantis and Lemuria existed for hundreds of thousands of years andAtlantisbroke up in stages over a long period before the final destruction. Bothculturesexpanded across the world with their priests and \"royal\" bloodlines or\"DragonPicture #7 [images/img_0007.png]Picture #8 [images/img_0008.png]Picture #9 [images/img_0009.png]Picture #10 [images/img_0010.png]39Kings\", founding colonies in all parts of the globe. With them went theirserpentsymbolism which has survived to this day in places like China and, mostcertainly,within the Illuminati. It was during the Atlantean-Lemurian era thatthe sameknowledge, stories, and symbolism were communicated all over the planet,and theroyal bloodlines of the extraterrestrial races were seeded everywhere.This explainshow, after the cataclysm, when European races \"discovered\" theAmericas,Australia, and other apparently unconnected regions of the world, theyfound thepeople telling the same stories and following the same basic religionsas each other(Figure 8). The common origin was Atlantis-Lemuria. As theytravelled andcolonised the Americas and what became Egypt and the Middle East,Europe,Scandinavia, and China, the Atlantean and Lemurian initiates used theiradvancedtechniques to build pyramids and other vast structures that we wouldstruggle tobuild even today. Researchers have established that these greatstructures were builtin geometrical relationship to each other over fantasticdistances in different parts ofthe planet. It appears to be a mystery how thiscould be done, but it's not. Thesacred places of the ancients (and theIlluminati today) were invariably the vortexpoints on the global energy grid.This is a web of force lines, known as ley lines ormeridians, which encircle andinterpenetrate the planet. I'll go into more detailabout this later. When theselines cross it creates a spiralling vortex of energy andPicture #11 [images/img_0011.png]Figure 8: The endless legends of the \"gods'1 travelling from a sunken land tofound civilisations around the worldcan be explained by the movement of peoplesfrom Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean and Lemuria, or Mu in the Pacific40Children of the Matrixthe more lines that cross, the bigger the vortex, obviously. It was at thesemulti-linevortexes, like Stonehenge, that the Atlanteans and Lemurians builttheir temples,pyramids, and so on. The grid is geometrical and the vortex pointsare ingeometrical relationship to each other. Therefore, anything built on thosepoints alsohave the same geometrical relationship with other structures on otherpoints.Simple, once you have the knowledge to locate the vortexes, which theAtlanteansand Lemurians could. The famous ancient and modern \"sacred sites\" areinvariablyassociated with the Atlanteans and Lemurians. Sedona in Arizona,famous for itsmassive vortexes to this day, is claimed to be an ancient colonyof the Lemurians, asis Mount Shasta in northern California.\" Sedona is alsoassociated by researchers ofUFO activity with a reptilian underground base wheremembers of the reptilianrace work with their human or part-human puppets in theIlluminati on thescientific and generic agenda. The base would appear to beunder Boynton Canyonin Sedona. This is not far in American terms from thereservation of the Hopi tribe,which has Lemurian connections.The Atlantean/Lemurian coloniesA branch of the Atlanteans and Lemurians who colonised the planet were calledtheCarians (Carian = \"Serpent Sea People of the Atlantean Fire God\"); theEus-Cara(same basic meaning); and the Tuarkes (Seipent People of the AllGlorious FireGod\").44 The Tuarkes became the Tuaraks, who settled in NorthAfrica with theirAtlantean knowledge; the Eus-Cara became the Basques of Spain;and the Cariansbecame known as the Phoenicians - a very important fact, as willbecome clearsoon.43 James Churchward also documents the Carians in the Americas.The Tauregpeople of North Africa today, descendants of the Tuarkes, have allowedsomevisitors to see their ancient cavern system in the Ahaggar Mountains wheretheyhave murals of their Atlantean ancestors holding snakes and swords withtridentson the blades.46 People invited into the underground temples of theTuaregs claim tohave seen green reptile \"monsters\" called Ourans, which theTuaregs worship as thephysical representations of their serpent goddess or\"grandmother\".47 The Tuaregsalso perform a dance in honour of the Atlantean firegod, Volcan or Votan. TheAtlanteans and Lemurians established colonies in Egypt,then known as Khem or\"Land of the Fire Serpent\". The letter \"K\", the sound usedso often by thesereptilian bloodlines apparently, was written in the form of aserpent in Egyptianhieroglyphics. Khem was the name of the deity symbolised as ablack goat and latecalled Pan. The goat is still a symbol of worship for theIlluminati and Saraniststoday under the name Baphomet. There are many survivingrecords that claim alineage of Egyptian kings going back tens of thousands ofyears before theformation of the Egyptian civilisation described by officialhistorians. This supportsthe stories of an Atlantean/Lemurian colony in Egyptlong before the cataclysm.The colonisation of Greece is also far older than officially claimed andthiscolony (called the Athenians) went to war with Atlanteans before the deluge.Platowrote of this war and official historians have dismissed it because theysay thatGreece did not exist that long ago. They are mistaken. The \"ClassicGreece\" theyfocus upon was a later expression of that culture, not the first. The originalGreeceexisted before the cataclysms that sank Atlantis. The Atlantean colonistsof Greeceworshipped a serpent goddess called Athene or Neith.48 The Greekhistorians, JaneHarrison and Robert Graves, say that this deity was symbolisedas a serpent, snake,sphinx, or goddess covered in snakes.49 There are somepeople - myself amongthem - who believe that the face on the Sphinx on the Gizaplateau is a woman andnot a man as officially claimed. Wherever the reptilianbloodlines have located, theworship of a serpent goddess has always been thecentre of their rituals undernames like Athene, Barati, Isis, Semiramis, El,Artemis, Diana, and Hecate. OtherAtlantean/Lemurian colonists were known as thePelasgians (\"Peoples of the Sea\"),the Danaans, and the female Amazons.50 ThePelasgians worshipped the serpentMoon goddess Dana, later Diana (Artemis), andthe Atlantean goat god called Pan.They first landed on the Peloponnese in Greeceand settled in Arcadia, according toancient Greek records. Arcadia has alwaysbeen a sacred place to the Illuminatibloodlines and was apparently a name forAtlantis.The Danaans left Atlantis to settle in Asia Minor (now Turkey), Greece, andtheislands of the Aegean. They are claimed by some authors to descend from theOldTestament Tribe of Dan, but so much in the Bible is symbolic rather thanliteral ordownright untrue. The name Danaans derived from their serpent Moongoddess,Dana or Diana. The Danaans made the headquarters of theirserpent-worshippingculture on the island of Rhodes, a name that originates froma Syrian word forserpent.51 Rhodes was the home of the Danaan brotherhood ofinitiates andmagicians known as the Telchines.52 The Greek historian, Diodorus,said theseinitiates had the ability to heal, change the weather, and\"shape-shift\" into anyform. Thousands of years later, one of the most importantof the Illuminati secretsocieties, the Knights Hospitaller of St John ofJerusalem, now the Knights of Malta,located on Rhodes and for a while were knownas the Knights of Rhodes.Ultimately, they came from the same source as theKnights Templar. The nameRhodes, which is connected to the German \"Rot\", meaningred, as with Rothschild(\"Red-shield\"), became a code name for the bloodlines.Red = Sirius? These guysdon't choose their locations or their names by accident.Malta, too, was animportant centre by 3500BC and the home of a major Mysteryschool. Under Malta isa vast network of tunnels and megalithic temples wheresecret rituals took place -and still do. Malta's original name was Lato, namedafter Mother Lato, the serpentgoddess.53 The Knights Templar secret society wasformed in the late 11th century toprotect the reptilian bloodline or \"Le SerpentRouge\", the red serpent or serpentblood, together with their associated order,the highly secretive Priory of Sion.54 Thegoals of the Knights Templar and theIlluminati were, and are, to place theseserpent bloodlines in all positions ofpower worldwide and thus form a reptilian,centrally controlled, fascist state.We are now getting very close to that. TheDanaans also settled on Cyprus (latercontrolled by the Knights Templar) and inancient times it was known as la-Dan orthe \"Isle of Dan\".55 The name of the Isle ofMan in the Irish Sea, a place soimportant to the Druids, has the same origin, nodoubt. The Taurus Mountains inTurkey, the Baleric Islands, and Syria (Sirius?) were42Children of the Matrixamong other Danaan settlements and they travelled from Atlantis to Britainwherethey became known as Tuatha de Danaan or the \"People of the Sea\". Thesecarriedthe Anunnaki reptilian bloodlines. The female Amazons were another branchof theAtlanteans and Lemurians and myths say they came from a paradisecalledHesperides or Hespera, a name for Atlantis.56 They, too, followed thegoddessAthene or Nieth and venerated her symbol, the double-headed axe. Theyfoundedshrines to the serpent goddess in many places, including the famouscentre forDiana worship at Ephesus and other locations along the Turkish coast.The\"Canaanites\" also descended from Atlantis/Lemuria.57 Mark AmaruPinkhamdescribes the migration of Atlanteans to \"Canaan\" in The Return OfTheSerpents Of Wisdom:\"One branch of these Atlantides were the Tyrrhenians, the people after whomthepresent Tyrrhenian Sea is named. The Tyrrhenians eventually split in half tobecomethe Etruscans and the Carians or Phoenicians, a tribe which eventuallymigrated toCanaan (pronounced Ka-nan with the K sound of the serpents), aterritory on the AsiaMinor coast, which can be translated as the \"Land of theFire Serpent\".58Running for coverAs these colonies and settlements were established, the serpent bloodlinesfromAtlantis and Lemuria were placed into the positions of ruling royal power,just asthey had been, at least in the latter stages, before those continentssank. These arethe same bloodlines that run the world today. Just before each ofthe cataclyms,many Atlantean and Lemurian royal bloodlines and initiates fled toother parts ofthe world, heading mostly for high places to escape the impendingflood.Atlanteans went to Britain, one of their colonies, to Europe, Scandinavia,NorthAfrica, the mountains of Turkey and Iraq, and the Americas. All along theAmericancontinent are the ancient legends and accounts of highly advancedbeings, thefounders of their culture, arriving with great knowledge from thesunken land inthe Atlantic. On the western seaboard of the Americas and in Asia,they talk ofsimilar advanced \"gods\" arriving from a sunken continent in thePacific.Polynesians claim that survivors from this lost continent travelled toIndia beforereturning to the remnants of their homeland, the Pacific Islands,and becoming thePolynesians.59' James Churchward says that these peoples alsosettled in Egypt viaIndia. Chinese legend talks of a continent in the same areacalled Maurigosima,which sank amid cataclysm, but its king, Peiru-un, escaped tomainland China andcontinued his bloodline there.60 This happened a number oftimes as Lemuria andAtlantis fell to cataclysmic events.I will focus from here on what happened after the stage-by-stage destructionofAtlantis in the period from around lO.OOOBC to 5000BC. When the Earth settleddownafter the incredible upheavals, the survivors from Atlantis and Lemuriabegan torecolonise the planet. And one of their key centres became known asSumer, the\"cradle of civilisation\", in the eyes of official history. This wasthe restarting ofcivilisation after the cataclysm. Sir Laurence Gardner is the current front manof theancient Imperial Royal Dragon Court and Order, which was originallycreated inEgypt about 2000BC to support the agenda of the so-called \"DragonKings\" orreptilian bloodlines. Gardner says that Sumaire in the old Irishlanguage meansdragon. He writes: \"It is also reckoned that the subsequentculture of the region,phonetically called Sumerian (pronounced \"Shumerian\") wasactually Sidhe-murian (\"Shee-murian\"). In fact, the case for this is nowconsiderable, since theearly Ring Lords of Scythia (the Tuatha De Danaanking-tribe) were actually calledthe Sumaire.\"61 Another researcher, Frans Kampin the Netherlands, tells me thatSumer means \"Land of the Dragon\" in thelanguage of the Scandinavian Vikings.The founders of Sumer were the samereptilian Anunnaki who had controlledAtlantis in its latter stages and led it todestruction. Their obsession with technologyand control by machine, socharacteristic of the final era of Atlantis, can be seen inthe world today.There is a reason for that: the Anunnaki are still in control.One theme of the Atlantean and Lemurian legends is that, especially in thelatterstages, there emerged a very dark force that took over the Mystery schoolsand theseats of power and used their advanced knowledge in the most horrendousandmalevolent ways. They manipulated people's minds and caused mayhem withthemisuse of esoteric \"magic\" - the manipulation of energy. Massive conflictseruptedand some accounts suggest that even the cataclysm itself could have beencaused bythe way they imbalanced the Earth's energy field. This was the Anunnakiat work -just as they are today.SOURCES1 W.T. Samsel article: \"The Aliens Are Among Us\" for the David Icke e-magazine,Volume 9.January 15th, 2000.

We areperhapstalking of around 7,000 years ago when Atlantis was finally destroyed,althoughthere are differing opinions on the precise timescale.Some ancient accounts say that the extraterrestrial \"gods\" (the \"Anunnaki\" oftheSumerian tablets) left the planet in their flying craft during the cataclysmandreturned when it was over. Wherever the surviving bloodlines and descendantsofthe Mystery school initiates of Atlantis and Lemuria resettled, advancedcivilisationsbegan to reappear. Egypt, China and the Indus Valley in India wereamong them, butthe most significant became known as Sumer between the Euphratesand Tigrisrivers in what we now call Iraq (Figure 9). Lawrence AugustineWaddell, betterknown as L.A., is a forgotten and unacknowledged genius who livedfrom 1854 to1938. He was a Scot who graduated from the University of Glasgowwith the highesthonours and went on to be professor of chemistry and pathologyat the CalcuttaMedical College in India. His highly decorated military career asa medical officerled him to travel widely across the Near and Far East and thisfuelled his passion touncover the truth of ancient history. He became a fellowof the RoyalAnthropological Institute and produced many brilliant books andpapers as hepieced together the evidence that demolished the official version ofhistory. In thefirst 38 years of the last century, Waddell proved that theSumer, Egypt, and IndusValley cultures were the same empire ruled by the sameleader (a fact verysignificant to the Christian story). But official historystill says they were notconnected and this is taught in schools and universitiesto this day. Waddell provedthat this Sumer Empire was also established in theBritish Isles and Ireland, andintroduced the same religious and cultural themesthere. This was the inheritedknowledge later administered by the Druids,successors in Europe to theAtlantean/Lemurian Mystery school priests. Theserulers of the Sumer Empire, heestablished, were what 1 am calling in this bookthe white \"Nordic\" race, the blue-eyed blonds. What Waddell did not realise, ofcourse, is that these bloodlines were ofextraterrestrial origin and that theirruling bloodlines had interbred with a reptilian4647Picture #12 [images/img_0012.png]Picture #13 [images/img_0013.png]BtacA SeaAnatolla/A&ia Minor/TurkeyRive*' E./f^'d’esGirt-fiR.f-f 7.£hsHa*arVn#whLebanonSUMERLarsa |E/'duEgyptFigure 9: The land of Sumer or Mesopotamia in what we now call Iraq. Mesopotamiameans \"between tworivers\" - the Tigris and the Euphratesrace to produce hybrid DNA. This is why these outwardly white bloodlinesweresymbolised by terms like the Dragon Kings. 1 know this all sounds fantastic,but staywith me and you will see the evidence to support this apparently bizarresuggestion.South to SumerAt least many strands of this \"Nordic” race travelled to Sumer from the farnorthwhere we now have Scandinavia and northern Europe. These were the Norsepeoplewho came down into France to establish Normandy and became the Normans,or\"Norse (north) Men\" who invaded Britain with William the Conqueror at the timeofthe Battle of Hastings in 1066. These regions of Scandinavia and Europewerecolonies of the former Lemurian/Atlantean empire. With the cataclysms camethe icesheets and those who survived fled south to what is now France, TheNetherlands(Holland), Belgium, and on down to the Mediterranean, the Middle andNear East,and India. Frans Kamp is a Dutchman 1 met while researching this bookand wespent two days together in the south of The Netherlands swappinginformation. Hehas been investigating the reptilian story full time since herealised that his wife ofmore than 12 years was a reptilian hybrid. I'll explainmore about this later. Aftertheir divorce, his experiences with her, and hisdesire to understand what was goingon, fired his passion to unlock the secrets.When I met him he was writing a book ofhis own, detailing his findings. Franssoon realised that to understand the worldtoday, vou have to research humanhistory. You can't have one without the other. His48Children of the Matrixresearch, particularly that of the Nordic peoples, led him to see that the whiterace ofSumer, or at least a significant part of it, had moved down from northernEuropeafter the upheavals. He says they came from locations called Friezland,Scandza, andTula, which could be today's Greenland, he thinks. Certainly thereis an Illuminatiinterest in Greenland that does not make sense when viewedsimply from theperspective of a vast island covered in snow and ice. One of thekey secret societiesbehind the German Nazis was called the Thule Society after\"Ultima Thule\", one ofthe alleged origins of the \"master race\" in the far northof the world. This \"Aryanmaster race” was said to be...blond-haired andblue-eyed. Frans Kamp says that thename Holland (a big region of TheNetherlands) came from Halland inScandinavia as those peoples moved south andsettled new lands. He suggests thatsome of the leaders of these Scandinaviantribes were called Teun, which becameTunis; Jon, which became Iona and Ionian;Geert, which became Geert-mannen orGeert-men, later Ger-man; and Otto, whichlater became Ottoman. He says that theIlluminati Habsburg bloodline was Nordicor Viking originally, but they interbredwith the reptilian race to form agenetic and political alliance. So did many others ofthe \"royal\" Nordicbloodlines. James Churchward, however, also documents thefundamental influencein the Sumer/Babylon region of former Lemurian peoples viaIndia. Frans Kamp cameacross a common theme I have found in reptilian research:they want somethingvery badly that is contained in the Nordic and human geneticcode. Interbreedingis their way to access it. The blond-haired, blue-eyed, race and itsconnectionto the reptilians is crucial to understanding both past and present, or,atleast, what we call past and present. Sumer was founded by the reptilianAnunnakibloodlines in league with factions of the Nordic Vikings and was thusknown in theViking language, according to Frans Kamp, as the \"Fand of theDragon\". Summaire,a Celtic word for dragon, was a later version of this. 1 thinkthe name \"Aryan\" is nodso much a term for the white race as widely believed, butfor the Nordic-reptilianhybrids, the so-called \"master race\" or \"noble race\".Whatever, 1 will use it in thatcontext throughout this book. The very name Aryancomes from the word \"Arri\",meaning noble one. The Illuminati refer to theirbloodlines as royal and noble, hencenobility and aristocracy or ARI-STOCK-RACY.The name Sum-ARIAN is, therefore,very appropriate.The Sumer EmpireF.A.Waddell's brilliant research really begins with the foundation of Sumeraround4000BC. He was an expert in Sumerian and Egyptian hieroglyphics and theSanskritlanguage of the Indus Valley. A rare gift indeed, and this allowed himto travel theseregions, reading the ancient accounts and the stories on thetemples and monumentsto show without question that Sumer, Egypt, and the IndusValley were parts of oneempire based on Sumer (Figure 10). It should beemphasised, however, that beforethe cataclysm a high civilisation had existedfor tens of thousands of years in India,as a colony of Femuria, and that Egypt,another Lemurian/Atlantean colony, alsowent back long before the Sumer Empire.Sumer, too, had Lemurian/Atlanteanorigins. Waddell's work is documented indetail in hisbook, Egyptian Civilisation,49Scythia- VAsia MinorVCrataSyriaSUMEREGYPTINDUS VALLEYCULTUREArabiaChinaTibat/AfricaFigure 10: Official history claims that the three highly advanced cultures ofSumer, Egypt and the Indus Valleydeveloped independently. L.A. Waddell showsthat they were all part of the empire ruled from SumerIts Sumerian Origin And Real Chronology (available from Hidden Mysteriesthroughthe David Icke website). He discovered from the time lines and thedescriptions ofthe leaders and their genealogy that the rulers of these threecultures were the samepeople under different names. It is the different namesthat have obscured the truthto a large extent. Historians have taken differentnames to mean different people.Not true. The endless \"gods\" in the variouscultures also turn out to be differentnames for the same deities. Once youunderstand this, wading into the past becomesa lot less complicated. Theadvantage that Waddell had over conventionalEgyptologists and \"historians\"(apart from an open mind) was that he could readSumerian and could thereforedecipher inscriptions in Egypt, which they could notunderstand. He could seethat early Egyptian hieroglyphics were those used by theirruling culture inSumer. It was only later that they evolved into an Egyptian systemdeveloped morelocally. It is the latter that Egyptologists have been decoding. TheearlierSumerian hieroglyphics in Egypt flummoxed them. But not Waddell.Here is one example of how he proved his point. One of the best-known kingsofSumer is called King Sargon. The Sumerians recorded that he had a son, wholaterbecame emperor, called Manis. At the same time, Waddell shows, the son oftheking in the Indus Valley was known as Manja, and in Egypt he was calledManj(abbreviated to Man) - the guy known to the Greeks as Menes and toEnglishEgyptologists as Mena.1 So we have the ruler's son, and later ruler, inSumer, Egypt,and the Indus Valley in the same period called variously, Manis,Manj, and Manja.50Children of the MatrixThe reason becomes obvious - it was the same fellah. Even the title given tohimwas the same or very similar in all three places. In Egypt he was known asManj-the-Warrior; in Sumer he was Manis-the-Warrior; and in the Indus Valley hewascalled Manja-the-Shooter.2His father, Sargon the Great, is a Semitic name for theSumerian-Mesopotamianemperor, King Gin, Gani, or Guni. He was called in thelater Babylonian texts, the\"King of the Four Quarters of the World\", becausethey knew (Babylon was also aMesopotamian culture) that the Sumerian Empire wasenormous. The Incas ofSouth America used this term \"Four Quarters\", also. In theIndian epics, Sargon'sson, Manja, was called \"The Royal Eye of Gopta and of theFour Ends of the Earth\"when he became emperor.3 In the Indus Valley clay sealrecords, Sargon and Manjaor Menes also called themselves and their dynasty Gutor Got (\"Goth\" to theRomans) and used the titles Bar or Par which means\"Pharaoh\", according toWaddell.4 Gut or Got became \"God\", a term used by thelater Goths. All non-Latinlanguages in Europe are derived from the Gothic,including English, and theancient Swedish language is still called\"Sueo-Gothic\".5 The former name forDenmark was \"Goth-land\" and a derivative wasJut-land.6 Gothic architecture, sobeloved of the bloodlines and the Illuminati,comes from the same source and thehorned headgear worn by the kings and leadersof European tribes and kingdoms:But these symbols, styles, and customs, go muchfurther back to Atlantis andLemuria. The name \"Catti\" for the ruling clan of theAncient Britons on pre-Romancoins is a dialectic form of Goti or \"Goth\".7 Whenthe Illuminati built the great\"Christian\" cathedrals of Europe, full of pagansymbolism on ancient pagan sacredsites, they used the \"Gothic\" style ofarchitecture. The symbolism of the \"Eye ofGopta\" may relate to the widely usedIlluminati symbol, the all-seeing eye or Eye:Horus, which you will find at thetop of the pyramid on the US dollar bill and onthe reverse of the Great Seal ofthe United States. The same symbols used by thisancient Sumerian dynasty arestill used by the Illuminati today, because they are thesame bloodlines and areworking with the same knowledge, hidden away sinceancient times within theMystery school and secret society networks. And thereptilian \"gods\" of Atlantisand Lemuria seeded these bloodlines.Waddell shows in his work. Makers Of Civilisation (Luzac and Company, 1929),thatSargon's Sumer-centred empire extended to the Indus Valley in the east,theBritish Isles in the west, encompassing much in between, and was larger thanthat ofAlexander the Great or the Romans. The Sumer Empire included much of theworldand it is from this same knowledge and information source that all thereligions haveemerged - the continuation of the knowledge and bloodlines ofAtlantis andLemuria. They may interpret this base information slightlydifferently andemphasise different strands, but the core from which they havecome is the same: theAtlantean, Lemurian and Sumer Empires and their beliefsystem, not least its focuson the worship of the Sun. Where did Christianity,Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,Buddhism, and others like Zoroasterism, etc., etc., allemerge from? The Middle andNear East, the vast region ruled from Sumer at onetime and still dominated by thatknowledge base and belief system in thethousands of years that followed Sumer'sdemise. The Sumerian story of King Sargon is a classic case. They said thathismother floated him in a basket of rushes on the river and he was found by amemberof the Sumerian royal family who brought him up as their own.8 TheHebrews, orrather their manipulating priests, the Levites, later stole thisancient story from theSumerian accounts and used it in the fable of theirinvented character known asMoses. The Old Testament is founded on Sumerianaccounts, edited and rewritten asrequired, to create a manufactured history andreligion called Judaism. The NewTestament is based on symbolic stories repeatedover and over in the thousands ofyears before its creation and based on theSumerian (and Golden Age) religion ofSun worship. The New Testament texts, inturn, created a manufactured religion andhistory called Christianity. Twoprison-religions and two make-believe histories forthe price of one book. Whatmore do you want? Great deal. Sold by the billion. KingSargon was a major Sunworshipper and these rulers of the Sumer Empire weregiven the title, \"Son of theSun\", as they were in Lemuria.9 Could this mean a son ofSirius? Or even Lemuria?To the Sumerians (like the Lemurians and Atlanteans), theSun was a symbol of\"God\" and from this title Son of the Sun later came the idea of aSon of God.Sumerian emperors were also often known as \"The One Lord\".The Sumer rule of Egypt and the Indus ValleyThe early official history of the Sumer \"satellite\" state called Egypt islargely based on\"king lists\" compiled by an Egyptian priest known as Manetho inthe 3rd century BCfor the Great Library of Alexandria. But this library wasdestroyed in AD391 in thecampaign to rewrite history, and only fragments ofManetho's lists have been retainedin the works of classic writers. Waddell showsthat Manetho's work, if indeed thosewriters have preserved it accurately, isfundamentally flawed and cannot be sustainedin the light of the evidence.10 Yetso much of the early Egyptian history taught in theschools and universities isbased on this very same flawed information. The span ofthe great Egyptianculture is broken up into distinct periods of kingdoms and rulingdynasties. KingSargon ruled Egypt from his Sumer base within the pre-dynasticperiod - around2700BC. The right to rule in the Sumer Empire (again like Lemuriaand Atlantis)was by bloodline, a fact fundamental to understanding how the worldis controlled- and who by - today. The Egyptian inscriptions detailed here werediscovered byWaddell to have been written in Sumerian hieroglyphics, not themuch laterEgyptian version with which Egyptologists are familiar. Sargon'sgrandfather(Khetm to conventional history) was known as: Takhu or Tekhi in theearlySumerian-style \"Egyptian hieroglyphs\"; as Tuke in the Old Sumerian kinglists;and as Vri-Taka or Dhri-Taka in the Indian king lists.\" These are slightlydifferentspellings for the same person who ruled all three. Sargon's father (RotoEgyptologists) was known in Sumerian-Egyptian hieroglyphics as Puru-Gin; intheOld Sumerian king lists he was Buru-Gina; in Indus Valley seals as Burn orPuru;and in the Indian king lists as Puru (II).12 Inscriptions relating to KingSargon himselfwere discovered in one of the oldest tombs at Abydos in UpperEgypt and Waddellestablished that the script used was early Sumerian. It was thesame as the script hesaw in Sumerian seals of the same Sargon period found inthe Indus Valley.52 Children of the MatrixKing Sargon, in this early Sumerian script, was known under his personal nameofG1N-UKUS or G1N-UKUSSI in Egypt - thus relating to his title King Gin or Guniandthe variant, Gani, in Mesopotamian inscriptions, particularly inBabylonian.13The title Ukus or Ukussi in Egypt means that he was a descendant ofthe firstSumerian king, Ukusi of Ukhu (meaning Sun Hawk City) and also the firstAryan(hybrid?) king in the Indian Epics and their holy books, the Vedas, whichuse thesolar title of Ikshwaku or Ukusi of Ukhu.14 All these kings of the SumerEmpirewere given \"solar titles\" because of the obsession and emphasis on theworship ofthe Sun and the symbolism of the Sun as God. Indeed it is extremelylikely thatHorns or Haru, the Egyptian Son of God and a mirror of the much later\"Jesus”,came from the Sumerian word, Hu or Ha, meaning hawk. The hawk orSun-hawkwas a Sumerian symbol for the Sun, as we see above in Sargon's verytitle. TheHeru of the Pygmy people, Hul-Kin of the Indians, Helios of theGreeks, and Hurkiof the Akkadian/Chaldeans of Mesopotamia probably come from thesame sourceand all relate to a Sun god of the Horus mould. In the same way, theMayans ofCentral America had a god called Hurakan and the Tibetans had thedeity, Heruka,which later evolved into the Herakles and Hercules of the Greeks,a society that wasfounded on the Sumerian (Atlantean) knowledge and beliefs.Hercules fought ashape-shifting \"river god\" called Achelous. The word hurricanecan be traced to thesame \"storm god\" symbolism, as the writer and researcher,Acharya, points out inher superb work, The Christ Conspiracy (AdventuresUnlimited, Kempton, Illinois,1999). I know all this gets a bit complicated, butwhat I am summarising here is justsome of the fantastic wealth of evidence thatcan be found in great detail inWaddell's work, and elsewhere, that Sumer was thecentre of a vast empire thatcreated, controlled, and instilled its beliefsystems into other great civilisationswhich, the official historians tell us,were not connected. But it is clear that theywere. More than that, they wereruled by one bloodline dynasty, the same dynasty,as I have established, thatruns our world today. The expansion of this empire out ofthe Near and MiddleEast can be shown in the story of King Sargon's successor aspriest-king of theSumerian Empire. This was his son, known variously as Manis,Manja, Manj, Mena,Manash or Minash, and to the Greeks as Menes. As the latter isthe most usedname, that is the one I will use here.The Minoan expansionMenes was the first Egyptian Pharaoh of the First Dynasty, which followed theso-called predynastic period, between 3000 and 2000BC. His Egyptianinscriptions,written in Sumerian, are in agreement with the accounts of his lifein Sumer and theIndus Valley. He was the governor of the Indus Valley colony,where the first in lineto the Sumerian throne ruled as Crown Prince awaiting thesuccession.15 They wereknown, according to surviving records, as Under-KingCompanions, written asShag-man, Shab-man, and, interestingly, Sha-man.16 ButMenes led a revolt againsthis father, Sargon, and took control of Egypt,declaring it independent of Sumer. Asa result, Sargon disinherited him and thesuccession went to his younger brother.But Menes succeeded after a decade or sowhen his brother died - probably withMenes' help. This story is told in the Indian Epic Chronicles and otheraccounts.Menes ruled Sumer after the death of his brother and this empireincluded anotheradvanced culture that, again, the official historians tell uswas independent ofSumer, Egypt, and the Indus Valley. This was the civilisationon the island of Creteknown as the Minoan (Figure 11 overleaf). The start ofthis advanced society isofficially estimated at about 2600BC, the same period,surprise, suiprise, as that ofSumer, and it was said to have been founded bypeople from Asia Minor, nowTurkey, which was part of the Sumer Empire of theAryan race. Minoan placenames have been found all over the Mediterranean, fromSicily to the Syrian Coast,including Cyprus.17 The Minoan culture was theimmediate inspiration for theclassic Greek period and the alleged founder of theMinoan dynasty was KingMinos, the hero of the later Greeks. But King Minos wasin fact the same...Menes,Manj, Manis, etc., the emperor of the Sumerian Empireand son of King Sargon. AsWaddell says in Egyptian Civilisation And Its SumerOrigin:\"The identity of Minos with Menes now becomes apparent, not only from theidentityin their personal tradition, and the equation in their names, but alsoin the essentialsof their culture and civilisation; and the Sumerian sign forthe man element in Menes'name in the Egyptian and Indus Valley inscriptions(Manj and Manja) reads alsodialectically Min.\"18The Sumerians, Egyptians, and Minoans also used identical systems fortheircalendars and their concepts of astronomy were identical. The most famousstory ofMinoan Crete is that of the son of King Minos. His son was said to bethe Minotaur,the half man, half bull, which defended the Labyrinth under thepalace at Knossosaccording to legend. How interesting, therefore, that Nar-am,the son of Menes, wasknown as the \"Strong Wild Bull\".19 His name, Nar-am,consisted of Nar, meaningstrong or mighty in both Sumerian and Egyptian, and am,meaning wild bull. Nar-am is also depicted in Egypt as a wild bull and it couldwell be that it was this son ofMenes (the real \"King Minos\") who inspired thesymbolic legend of the Minotaur inthe Labyrinth at Knossos. The Minoan culturewas a mirror of the Sumerian and theperiod of Menes in Egypt. The art was thesame or similar, and so were the clay sealsused for writing and recordingevents. The Sumerian-Egyptian form of writing fromthe Menes-Sargon period, thefuneral rites, and even the terracotta drainpipes usedby the \"Minoans\" were thesame as those found in Sumer.20 Here are just some of the\"similarities\" listedby Waddell between the documented life of Menes, the EgyptianPharaoh andSumerian emperor, and King Minos of Greek and Cretan legend.Both were of the Bronze Age, replacing the Neolithic period. Both were knownassea emperors of the Mediterranean. Both were said to haveintroducedcivilisation. Both built a Labyrinth. Both died on a sea voyage to theWest. Bothused seal impressions on clay and both used a linear script ofSumerian type, orvery similar. Both had the same physical \"Aryan” appearance.Minos was said to bethe son of Zeus, Menes was descended from Zagg (Zeus). Minoswas a votary andpriest of Zeus; Menes was a votary and high priest of Zagg.Minos was a giver of54Children of the MatrixPicture #14 [images/img_0014.png]laws direct from Zeus (another story constantly repeated around the worldandused for the make-believe Moses) and Menes established laws said to havecomefrom Zagg. The son of Minos was a bull-man or Minotaur. The son of Meneswasknown as \"The Strong Wild Bull\".21Can even the most padlocked of academic minds still go on ignoring the factthatMenes was Minos? 1 suspect they can. In doing so they hold together thehouse ofcards that scams people into missing a truth, as we shall explore, whichis critical tounderstanding the so-called unexplainable \"mysteries\" of the pastand, moreimportantly, to identify who has been controlling our lives overthousands of yearsto the present day. That truth is this: the astonishingcultures across the ancientworld that \"suddenly\" emerged at a level ofadvancement far ahead of others of thetime, were not created by a series ofunconnected, \"independent\" peoples whoapparently developed precisely the sameknowledge, art work, building techniques,writing, funeral ceremonies, andstories, at the same time as each other. They wereall aspects of the sameculture and control, based on Sumer, an empire that not onlyextended to theIndus Valley, Egypt, the Mediterranean, and the British Isles, but alsoacrossthe Atlantic to the Americas and quite probably as far as Australia andChina.And the knowledge base of Sumer, and most certainly some of theidenticalknowledge, stories, and myths, found all over the ancient world, hadtheir origins inthe global society of the \"Golden Age\" before the upheavals -Atlantis and Lemuria.The Sumerian expansion to Europe, the Americas, and AustraliaVarious parts of this same Aryan-Sumer Empire, and its later remnantsandinspirations, were known as the Amorites, Hittites, Phoenicians, Goths,Hamites,Indo-Aryans, Nordics, ancient Greeks, and many other names. Like I say,1 thinkwhat we call Aryan are the Nordic-reptilian hybrids. History records theexistenceof the Hittites and the Phoenicians, but as different peoples, not asdifferent namesfor the same Sumerian and former Atlantean/Lemurian Aryan raceand empire.The Phoenicians were the Carian people from Atlantis and Lemuria andCarianmeans \"Serpent Sea People of the Atlantean Fire God\".22 JamesChurchward'sresearch shows that the Carian people, originally from Lemuria, alsosettled in theAmericas. Unmistakable Phoenician remains have been found inBrazil and,according to a man 1 met who once worked in covert operations for theBritishGovernment, similar Phoenician artefacts were discovered in therainforests ofQueensland, Australia, a few miles from where Captain Cook landedon his voyageof \"discovery\". It was a journey of rediscovery in truth, and itwas funded andorganised by the Royal Society in London, a body created andcontrolled from thestart by Freemasons. The Queensland find would help toexplain why someAustralian aboriginal terms are the same as the Egyptian,although the Lemurianconnection would do that also. Evidence of Phoenicianactivity has been identifiedin New England on the eastern seaboard of the UnitedStates and unmistakableEgyptian-Oriental remains were discovered in the GrandCanyon in Arizona in thefirst decade of the 20th century. Ancient Chineseartefacts have also been found inMexico and California. We only know of theGrand Canyon find thanks to lengthy56Children of the Matrixarticles in the local paper at the time, the Arizona Gazette,23 because everyeffort hasbeen made to suppress the knowledge, as with the discoveries inQueensland. TheSmithsonian Institution in Washington DC (the Smithson family isone of thebloodlines) was created for the very reason of suppressingarchaeologicaldiscoveries that rewrite the manufactured history whileemphasising those thatcan be encompassed in the fairy tale.The accounts and symbolic religious tales were taken across the globe bytheSumerian seafarers like the Phoenicians, the bloodlines of Atlantis. Theyreinforcedthe stories and symbols that were taken to those areas thousands ofyears earlier bythe Atlanteans and Lemurians. When the later Europeans landed inthe Americasand other parts of the world with Columbus and his successors, theyfound to theirastonishment that the native peoples were telling the same storiesand myths thatwere told in Europe and the Middle and Near East. Theirastonishment came fromtheir belief that these cultures on different sides of theworld had never met before.But they had. They were part of the globalAtlantean/Lemurian empire and laterthe near-global empire of Sumer. The leadersof the European explorers likeColumbus knew the truth, however, because of theirsecret society background. Thecorresponding stories and customs on both sides ofthe Atlantic included the virginbirth, crucifixion, circumcision, and the GreatFlood. The similarities were sostriking, the Christian priests sought to keepthis knowledge quiet for fear ofundermining their \"unique\" religion. The keyCentral American deity, Quetzalcoatl,was \"Jesus\" under another name long beforethe Christian religion waded ashorewith Columbus and Cortes. Quetzalcoatl wasborn to a virgin mother, fasted for 40days, was tempted by their version ofSatan, and left promising to return in asecond coming. Indeed, when Cortes, theSpanish architect of native genocide,landed there in the years after Columbus,he was treated as a god because, with hisEuropean features, he was considered tobe the return of Quetzalcoatl. Somethingsimilar happened in Africa when thewhite Europeans arrived and the nativepeople believed they were the return ofthe \"Nordic\" extraterrestrial beings of thenlegends. Cortes was obviously awareof the Quetzalcoatl story because he landednear the point the legend said thedeity would return and he wore a plumed hat inline with Quetzalcoatl's title ofthe \"Plumed Serpent\". Cortes even arrived in 1519,the time the native peoplebelieved that Quetzalcoatl would come back. Just oneexample of how easy it is tomanipulate people through their beliefs.The travels of the Aryan Sumerians and their earlier \"Golden Age\" ancestorsalsoaccount for the \"mystery\" of the countless legends in the Americas of the\"whitegods\" who came from the sea bringing great knowledge and civilisation.There wasonce a race of white men in Central-South America who wore beards andlooked likePhoenicians. The Central American culture with its incredible ancientcities andpyramids, attributed to the Maya people in the Yucatan, is one suchexample of thisancient interaction. The step pyramids of the Yucatan, which infact go back waybefore the Maya who inherited them, are so similar to theclassic ziggurats built forthe \"gods\" of Sumer. There are great similarities inart and language between thetwo, as there are between Central American religionand language and that of theHindus and the Middle-Near Eastern Semites. The mother goddess, Maya, hasthesame name in the Maya culture as she does in India and there are Mayanremains atan ancient Egyptian site I have visited not far from Giza. JamesChurchward showsin The Children Of Mu that all these \"Maya\" peoples around theworld originated inLemuria-Mu, hence the common connections. Also, the legendaryfounder of theMaya culture, called Votan or Wotan, is the name of the Atlanteanfire god and alsothe god of the Teutonic peoples of Germany and Scandinavia. Hewas one of thegods of the Nazis and they were created by the Teutonic Knightsnetwork(Illuminati) in Germany. The Teutonic Knights were formed in the sameperiod, andoperated in the same \"Holy Land\" region, as the Knights Templar andthe Knights ofMalta and they work to the same basic agenda right to this day.That part of the Sumerian Empire known as the Phoenicians, with their base intheMiddle East and what we now call Turkey, particularly Cappadocia, were verymuchinvolved in establishing Sumerian control of the British Isles. Under othernamesthese peoples were known as the Hittites and the Goths. Once again L.A.Waddellhas established that the Phoenicians were not a Semitic race as claimedbyofficial historians, but another name for the Aryan race based on Sumer in thepost-Atlantis period. Examinations of Phoenician tombs have revealed that theywere ofthe long-headed Aryan-type, as are depictions of the Pharaohs and royalfamilies inEgypt.24 This is also why the Egyptians and other cultures portrayedmany of theirgods, like Osiris, with white skin and blue eyes - that's what theruling race lookedlike. The twist was that their \"royal\" and \"noble\" bloodlineshad interbred with thereptilian Anunnaki. The very name, Iran, another part ofthe Sumer Empire, comesfrom the word Airy-ana or Air-an, which means Land of theAryas or Aryans.25There is still a race of white, often blue-eyed, people inKurdistan.The Sumerian-Phoenicians arrive in Britain and IrelandThe Phoenicians (Sumerian Empire) had landed in the British Isles by atleast3000BC (Figure 12 overleaf).26 This corresponds with the period when, it isclaimed,the great stone circles like Stonehenge and Avebury were built with thesameastonishing precision that you find with the Giza pyramids and otherbreathtakingstructures across the Sumerian and former Atlantean-Lemurian Empire.Whoeverdesigned Stonehenge must have had a very advanced knowledge ofmathematicsand astronomy. Geoffrey of Monmouth, the 12th-century historian,wrote inHistories Of The Kings Of Britain that the builders of the originalStonehenge were\"giants\" from North Africa.27 The Aryans of Sumer and Egypt werea tall peoplebecause they came from the very tall Nordics and the reptilians,which are almostalways described as very tall. This fits with the emergingthemes of this book andcertainly the official version of Stonehenge is utterlyludicrous. As John A. KeelPoints out in Our Haunted Planet (FawcettPublications, USA, 1971):\"We are also asked to believe that they pushed and hauled these monstrous stones[for 240 miles] up and down hills, across rivers, through forests and soupy bogsonsledges and wooden rollers ...Plainly the whole thing is quite absurd.\"2858Children of the MatrixPicture #15 [images/img_0015.png]Figure 12: From at least 3000BC. peoples of the Sumer Empire, like thePhoenicians and Egyptians, sailed toBritain and took their knowledge and symbolsto those islands. Others began to move across land to settle inwhat we now callFrance, Germany, and the rest of northern Europe. Wherever they went, thereptilianbloodlines invariably ruled as kings, queens, and nobilityAnd, of course, Stonehenge is just one of hundreds of stone circles andstandingstones erected in Britain in this same period. We do have to be carefulhere as datesare increasingly, and often dramatically, re-assessed. TheSumerians were headingback to where the pre-cataclysmic Atlanteans once had amajor colony, and some ofthese famous structures of the British Isles andelsewhere may have already been inplace long before they returned. Either ofthese explanations, the Atlantean buildersor the Sumerian Empire, would accountfor where the knowledge came from toalign them so exactly to the cycles of theSun, Moon, and star systems, as well as inrelationship to each other via thegeometrical energy grid. Waddell explains in hisbook, The Phoenician Origins OfBritons, Scots And Anglo Saxons (Christian BookClub, California, 1924), how hefound Sumerian markings on one of the stones atStonehenge and on other stonesaround the British Isles, including some inScotland.29 Professor AlexanderThorn, Emeritus Professor of Engineering Science atOxford University from 1945to 1961, discovered that the builders of Stonehengeknew of \"Pythagorean\"geometric and mathematical principles thousands of yearsbefore Pythagoras wasborn.30 The same was true of those who built the Gizapyramids. Now we can seewhy. The Greek genius Pythagoras, which means \"I amthe Python\" or \"I am theSerpent\",31 and all the famous Greek mathematicians,philosophers, scientists,doctors, and so on, inherited their knowledge through thehighly secretiveMystery schools from the Sumerians, Minoans, and Egyptians, who59were all the same peoples in reality. And they, in turn, inherited from AtlantisandLemuria. History becomes much simpler once this sequence is understood.TheSumerian elite and their Golden Age ancestors also had the knowledge of howtothrow a magnetic field around an object and disconnect it from the laws ofgravity.They could make it weightless. Such a skill makes it so much easier tomove andplace vast stones for these \"mystery\" structures like Stonehenge and thePyramids!The serpent gridI cannot stress enough the importance to these ancient peoples of the globalenergygrid and especially the major vortex points where many of the energy linescross.This energy was often symbolised as a serpent. The more esotericresearchers whoacknowledge the vast symbolism and references to serpentbloodlines, serpentknowledge, and serpent people, say these were merely codes relating to thisEarthenergy grid known as dragon lines or ley lines (hence so many British placenamesend in \"ley\"). The association of serpent symbolism with this universalenergy andits most powerful centres is clear to see. But, at the same time, theevidence thatthere is a controlling force taking a reptilian form is sooverwhelming that there isno way that the constant references to serpent ordragon bloodlines can bedismissed as simply code for this energy or knowledge of the grid. And whataco-incidence that we have all the legends and accounts of a serpent racebringingand teaching knowledge about this grid, and the energy of that very gridbecomesassociated with the serpent. No connection? As I said earlier, these leylines connectto form a web or grid of magneticenergy, the universal life force,which flowsalong these lines thatsurround and interpenetrate theplanet. The human body has asimilar system and the ancientChinese healing artknown asacupuncture works with the \"ley\"lines, dragon lines, or meridians ofthephysical body. That's why theyinsert hair-like needles. They arebalancing theflow of energy. Theancients, including the Atlanteans,Lemurians, and the peoplesof theSumer Empire, used standingstones like acupuncture needles forthe Earth. They declared theseFigure 13: Theancient sacred sites of the world, like major vortex centres to besacredStonehenge, are points on the global energy grid where and these are thelocations of themany force lines, or \"ley\" lines, cross and create a massive ,vortex of energy. This is where the stone circles, pyramids, standing stonecircles, pyramidsand the major Freemasonic temples are located. Energy = andancient earthworks all overpower if you know how to use it the world (Figure13). Also, thePicture #16 [images/img_0016.png]60Children of the Matrixcorrelation between these sites and \"faults\" in the Earth's magnetic fieldareobvious, and studies have shown that \"paranormal\" events andexperiences,including \"UFO\" sightings, tend to happen mostly at or near thesemagnetic faultsIn her book. Where Science And Magic Meet (Element Books,Shaftesbury, England,1991), Serena Roney-Dougal points out that of the 286 stonecircles in Britain, 235are built on rocks more than 250 million years old, thestatistical chances of whichare more than a million to one. Robert Graves, thepoet and writer on mythologyand mysticism, said:\"There are some sacred places made so by the radiation created by magneticores.My village, for example, is a kind of natural amphitheatre enclosed bymountainscontaining iron ore, which makes a magnetic field. Most holy places inthe world -holy not by some accident, like a hero dying or being born there -are of this sort.Delphi was a heavily charged holy place.\"42Delphi in Greece was the centre for the \"Oracle\", a psychic woman or\"channel\",who connected her consciousness with other-dimensional entities andspoke theirwords. They knew that the sites of magnetic \"faults\" act as doorwaysto these otherdimensions or densities, and allow both interdimensionalcommunication andtravel to happen more easily. Satanists use these samelocations around the world intheir rituals designed to manifestother-dimensional demonic entities. The RomanChurch insisted that its churchesand cathedrals be built on former pagan sitesbecause these were theinterdimensional doorways, gateways, or portals. Again,this is why Satanistsseek to use Christian churches for their rituals: they want toaccess the energyin the vortexes on which the churches were placed. Freemasonicand other secretsociety temples are located on these points. The ancientAtlantean-Lemurian-Sumerian knowledge has been passed on through this covertnetworkwhile being systematically suppressed among the people. Religion hascondemnedit as \"evil\", and science\" has dismissed it as nonsense. And the sourceof bothreligion and \"science\" is the same Illuminati network. Surprised?It is claimed by historians that British Druids built the stone circles, buttheyconfuse using them with building them. Groups use them today for rituals,but noone is suggesting that these groups built them! Archaeologists findDruidicremains on these sites and assume they created them. They do the samewith thelater Mayans of Central America and the Incas of South America. ThelaterDruidic religion and knowledge was brought by the Atlanteans originallyandre-enforced by the Sumerians with their great understanding ofastronomy,astrology, sacred geometry, mathematics, and the ley line system or\"energy grid\".Both sources also knew of the cycle called \"precession\" in whichthe Earth's\"wobble\" slowly moves the planet on its axis so it faces differentstar systems orastrological \"houses\" over thousands of years. It takes 2,160years to cross onesymbolic \"house\" and 25,920 years to complete the cycle of 12.We are, somebelieve, completing one of these great cycles now and they arealways periods ofenormous change, it is said. Once again these ancientSumerians, Atlanteans and61Lemurians, under various names, built their temples and sacred buildingsinrelation to, or in acknowledgement of, their knowledge of precession.Suppressing the gridI have a rather controversial view (makes a change) of at least some pyramids,stonecircles, and earthworks placed on the vortexes. From the start of myconsciousjourney in 1990 1 have had a bad feeling about many of theseconstructions. NewAgers see them as sacred places and go to the stone circlesand pyramids for theirceremonies and so on. But just because the vortex pointsare power centres on theglobal grid, it doesn't mean that the structures builtat these places by the bloodlineshave been designed and located with humanity'sbest interests at heart. I am nottalking about all of them here, but I don'tfeel good myself about the Giza site orStonehenge, among others. These locationsare incredible centres of energy and yetwhen we go there we feel a fraction oftheir true power because the structures builton them are often suppressing thatpower. My own feeling is that they were part ofa network designed to close downthe true potential of the grid and disconnect thehuman energy field from thecosmic one. Every planet and star has an energy gridand these connect with eachother in a vast cosmic web. We in turn connect withthis network through ourhuman energy grid, the meridian system on whichacupuncture is based. If you candisconnect the human energy field from theplanetary and cosmic grid you putpeople in a disconnected vibrational prison.Still today, the Illuminati placestructures like nuclear power stations and motorway(freeway) intersections onthe vortex points for the same reason. A busy road hasbeen built through thecentre of the massive Avebury stone circle (vortex) inWiltshire, England. It islike throwing a spanner into an electrical system. It throwsit into chaos. I'mnot saying that these places are negative in themselves. They arejust energy. Iam talking of the structures built upon them to manipulate the flow ofthatenergy. I think people miss the point that you can program stones, withtheirquartz crystal content, and obelisks etc., to do a positive or negative jobfor you inthese places. I think that many have been put there to disrupt andsuppress. Just myview. The Illuminati keep their most powerful vortex pointsclean and secret,known only to themselves.Among the ancient landscape features still visible today in the west ofEnglandare the white horses scored from the chalk hillsides. The oldest,according toconventional archaeology, is the one at Uffington in the Vale of theWhite Horse inWiltshire, not far from Avebury circle. This has been dated to3000BC, the timewhen the Sumerian-Phoenicians were introducing (orre-introducing) their culture,religion, and knowledge to Britain. Why whitehorses? The basic religion of theSumerian-Phoenicians was the worship of the Sunand the white horse was one oftheir symbols for the Sun.” This white horsesymbolism is also the source of thereferences to stories about white horses inrelation to the Christian Jesus andHindu Krishna. Jesus and Krishna are symbolsfor the Sun with their origin in theSumerian Sun religion and its stories andsymbols. Neither really existed. There arealso people who believe that theUffington \"white horse\" is really a dragon and, if62Children of the Matrixthat is so, it fits with the previous name for the Phoenicians, the Carians or\"SerpentSea People of the Atlantean Fire God\". The tin mines of Cornwall in thefar west ofEngland were first created by the Sumerian Empire and this was knownto them intheir writings as \"The Tin Land Country\".33 A Phoenician deity, laterencompassedinto Christianity, was St Michael and so you have St Michael's Mountjust off theCornish Coast near Penzance.34 The tin ships operated from here, andthere aremany other references to \"St Michael\" in that region. OtherPhoenician-Sumeriandeities were St George of Cappadocia in Turkey, who defeatedthe dragon andbecame the patron saint of England; Barat, a male deity, whobecame \"Briton\"; andBarati, the female, who became the British heroine,Britannia, when these deitieswere brought to these islands by the SumerianEmpire (Figure 14).35 According toSir Laurence Gardner, the spokesman of theancient Imperial Court of the RoyalDragonand Order, Barat-Anna (Great Mother of the Fire Stone) symbolised the wifeofAnu, the chief of the Sumerian reptilian gods called the Anunnaki(seewww.nexusmagazine.com/ringlordsl.html http). Names very similar to BaratandBarati can be found in the Indian holy books, the Vedas, because theseaccountswere inspired by the same Sumerian (Aryan) and Atlantean/Lemuriansources. Thelater Romans, another empire based on the Sumerian/Atlanteanknowledge andbloodlines, knew Barati as \"Fortune\", a reference to Barati'slegend as the goddessof fortune.36 They symbolised and described her in the sameway the Phoeniciansdid with Barati and theBritish do with Britannia. TheEgyptians had agoddesscalled Brith, goddess of thewaters, another version ofBarati, and theMinoans(Sumerian-Egyptians) onCrete knew her as Brito-Martis, who, in turn, isassociated with the goddessDianaor Artemis, otherversions of the same theme.37Figure 14: The Phoenician Baratibecame the British Britannia after j-pjs information is onethe Sumer Empirearrived. Ori the left is an old British penny soluqon tQ the \"mystery\"ofdepicting Britannia and alongside is Barati on a Phoenician coin. . J JThe stories told about these deities were the same why the maJor symbols ofthe British Isles came from theMiddle and Near East. For instance, the flags of England (cross of StGeorge),Scotland (cross of St Andrew), Ireland (cross of St Patrick), as well asthe ensigns ofScandinavia, were all carried as standards of victory by thePhoenicians.38 Theevidence of the Aryan-Sumerian connection to Irelandemphasises the point.According to Arbois de Juvainville, the author of the work,Cours De LiteratureCeltique, the Irish were known as \"Egyptians\" in the MiddleAges. St Patrick, ofwhom no literal evidence has been found, is claimed by someto be an Irish namefor the Egyptian deity, Ptah, who was introduced to Irelandby Egyptian membersPicture #17 [images/img_0017.png]Picture #18 [images/img_0018.png]of the Sumerian Empire.39 It is said of St Patrick that he removed all thesnakesfrom Ireland. Here are just some of the connections between North Africaandthe \"Emerald Isle\" - Ireland.The distinctive round towers in Ireland are of Phoenician origin and theIrishharp (and Scottish bagpipes) came from North Africa, as did the name of theclassicIrish symbol, the sham lock. Any three-leaf plant in Egypt is known as ashamrukh.The rosary beads, such a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church (createdby theSumerian-inspired Romans and based on Sun worship), are from the MiddleEastand still used by the Egyptians. The word \"nun\" is Egyptian and their garbisMiddle Eastern. The old Irish sailing craft called a pucan was designed inNorthAfrica where it was used on the River Nile. Old Irish books employ the samestylesas those found in Egypt and even the colours used in the Irish Book ofKells andBook of Durrow are from Middle Eastern insects and plants. The famousancientmound at Newgrange, north of Dublin, has a narrow passageway of some 62feetthat perfectly aligns with the Sun as it rises on the winter solstice. It isso precisethat at the solstice sunrise, its golden light shines directly throughthis narrowpassage to illuminate the chamber deep in the centre of the mound.Again thepresent dating of Newgrange and other ancient Irish standing stonesandearthworks fits the period when the Sumerian empire arrived and the duelspiralimages found at Newgrange are identical to those found at other centres oftheSumer/Lemurian/Atlantean Empires, like Malta. The entrances to manyothergreat structures within that empire are the same as that at Newgrange,includingthe one at the Minoan Palace of Minos (Menes) on Crete. It becomesclear why Ihave noticed on my many visits to Ireland that so many of their oldplace nameshave a Middle and Near Eastern feel about them. Indeed, asresearchers haveshown, the old Irish languages, like Gaelic, are remarkablysimilar to those found inNorth Africa. The reason is simple. They have the samebase origin. As Waddellsays in Phoenician Origins Of Britons:\"I had recognised that the various ancient scripts found at or near theoldsettlements of the Phoenicians, and [those known as] Cyrian, Karisn, AramaicorSyrian, Lykian, Lydian, Corinthian, Ionian, Cretan or \"Minoan\", Pelasgian,Phrygian,Cappadocian, Cilician, Theban, Libyan, Celto-lberian, Gothic Runes,etc., were allreally local variations of the standard Aryan Hitto-Sumerianwriting of the AryanPhoenician mariners, those ancient pioneer spreaders of theHittite Civilisation alongthe shores of the Mediterranean and out beyond thePillars of Hercules [betweenSpain and North Africa] to the British Isles.\"40In truth, this was the Nordic race and the Nordic-reptilian \"Aryans\" returningtothe lands from which many of their ancestors came after the Atlanteancataclysms.The evidence presented in this chapter, and this is a fraction ofwhat exists evenafter thousands of years of suppression, supports Waddell'sconclusion that Menes,Manis, Manj, the son of Sargon, ruler of the SumerianEmpire, and also known asKing Minos to the Greeks, actually died in Ireland.\"This story sums up how64Children of the Matrixludicrous official history can be and how one mis-translation can make acompletepig's ear of what really happened. According to the accepted story,Menes died aftera reign of some 60 years when he was killed by a \"Kheb beast\"that came from thewaters of the Nile. This \"Kheb beast\" has been translated ashippopotamus. But, asWaddell points out, the word \"Kheb\" in Egyptian also meanswasp or hornet.42Pictographs relaying this story portray an insect that looksremarkably like a waspor hornet and very unlike a friggin' hippo, unless inthose days hippos had wingsand looked like flying insects. Accounts of Menes'death found in his \"tomb\" (intruth his memorial or cenotaph) at Abydos in Egyptcan therefore be translated asfollows (another of his names, Manash or Minash,is used here):\"The King Manash (Minash), the Pharaoh of Mushsir (Egypt), the Land of theTwoCrowns, the perished dead one in the West, of the (Sun-) Hawk race, AhaManash (orMinash) of the Lower (or Sunrise or Eastern) and of the Sunset (orUpper or Western)Waters and of their Lands and Oceans, The Ruler, The King ofMushrim (the twoEgypts) Lands, the son of the Great Sha-Gana (or Sha-Gunu) ofthe (Sun-) Hawk race,The Pharaoh, the deceased, the Commander-in-Chief of Ships.\"The Commander-in-Chief of Ships (Minash) made the complete course to the Endofthe Sunset Land, going in ships. He completed the inspection of the WesternLands,He built (there) a holding (or possession) in Urani Land. At the Lake ofthe Peak, Fatepierced (him) by a Hornet (or Wasp), The King of the Two Crowns,Manshu. This boardtablet set up of hanging wood is dedicated (to his memory)\".43No one had previously connected the location of Menes' death to Ireland,notleast because that country is not famous for the hippopotamus. As the accountatAbydos reveals, Menes died while inspecting the \"End of the Sunset Land\".44Thiswas in the west, therefore, of the Egyptian-Sumerian Empire at that time.Waddellsuggests that this location was beyond the Sumerian Tin Lands (Cornwall)and canbe identified as Ireland.45 He says that the name Urani is the originalform of theword, Erin - the old name for Ireland.46 Representations of Irelandas the \"End ofthe Sunset Land” have been found at Irish sites, including socalled \"cup-marked\"inscriptions on stones at Newgrange, which are virtualreplicas of those found inearly Sumerian and Hittite seals.47 Waddell confirmedhis theory when he foundSumerian inscriptions on pre-historic stones at agravesite at Knock-Many (\"Hill ofthe Many\") near Clogher on the southern borderof County Tyrone. He found themto be virtually identical to those on the \"tomb\"of Menes at Abydos.48 One of thestones even had the same monogram of the name\"Urani\" and a pictograph of thecause of death... a hornet.49 Knock-Many wouldseem to be the true grave of Menes,ruler of the Sumerian Empire, which includedBritain and Ireland. Unfortunately,these inscriptions were destroyed atKnock-Many when they were cleared of lichenwith the use of corrosive chemicalssupported by vigorous scrubbing. Waddellrecords, however, that excellentphotographs of them were taken by a Mr R. Welchin 1896 and so somewhere, Itrust, they are preserved.5065Waddell's work is further supported by evidence that Egyptians wereshipwreckedoff the east coast of Britain some 2,700 years ago and settled in thearea nowoccupied by the city of Hull. Three wooden boats found in mud on thehanks of theRiver Humber in 1937 were thought to be Viking. Now they are saidto date fromaround 700BC and they are identical to ones that once navigated theNile.51 1 canunderstand the confusion with the Vikings, however, because theScandinavianNordics travelled south to Egypt and Sumer after Atlantis and therewould be manysimilarities and mutual origins. The Egyptologist, Lorraine Evans,also says inher book, Kingdom Of The Ark (Simon & Schuster, London, 2000) thatthe ancientEgyptians established a colony in Ireland 3,500 years ago, after landinginCounty Kerry. She suggests that the invaders were led by Princess Scota,thedaughter of a pharaoh, and that she is buried in a valley called Scota's Glenaboutfive miles from Tralee in County Kerry where she died after a bloody warwithindigenous Irish people. The grave is marked with a slab, but has neverbeenexcavated. Evans says that Scota's descendants went on to become the highkingsof Ireland at Tara in County Meath and then invaded Scotland or Scota-land.Evanssays that she used old texts and archaeological, linguistic and DNAevidence toshow that Irish and British people descended from Egyptians. She saysthatScota's real name was Meritaten and that she was the daughter of thepharaoh,Akhenaten, and a half-sister to Tutankhamen. The Hill of Tara, not farfromNewgrange, was the seat of the Irish king of kings (equivalent of theBritish\"Pendragon\") and it is worth emphasising that the \"elite\" bloodlines ofIrelandand Scotland are extremely important to the Illuminati. Bronze Ageshields foundon the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry were identical to thosediscovered inSpain, which were identified as ancient Egyptian weaponry. Otherarchaeologistsand Egyptologists have dismissed Evans' claims, but she says thather findings inHull and elsewhere will revolutionise views about our ancestors:\"The simple factthat many peoples of Britain are going about their dailybusiness unaware of theirEgyptian heritage is astounding.\"52 But not quite soastounding when you realisethat those in control don't want people to know thatbecause it rewrites theirofficial version of history.There are many key points in this chapter that are vital to understandingboththe background to religion, and the nature and source of the manipulation oftheworld today. Many thousands of years ago, there was a global society ofgreatadvancement that was brought to an end by a series of immense globalcatastrophesand the world went back to the drawing board. After the planet beganto recoverand up to the period of around 2000BC, when the Sumer Empire began todismantle,another near-global society was developed. It was controlled fromSumer andcreated from the advanced knowledge held by its ruling elite. Thissociety was built onthe same basic foundations of religion, knowledge, andculture that hadprevailed in the pre-cataclysmic Atlantis/Lemuria, although itdid not advance to thesame levels. The foundation religion of the Sumer Empire,and therefore all ofits vast lands and peoples, was the worship of the Sun andmany symbolic storiesemerged to describe the cycles of the Sun, Moon, stars, andseasons.66Children of the MatAnother point to stress in the story so far is that the rulers of theSumerianEmpire were chosen by bloodline, an immensely relevant point as we shallnow see.Given the origin of these bloodlines, we are about to enter a dogma-freezone inwhich it would be sensible to fasten your seat belts and be aware ofpossible mentaland emotional turbulence. Readers with closed minds andprogrammed beliefs,who have a fear of climbing to high altitudes to view a muchbigger picture ofpossibility, should venture no further. For those who willtherefore be leaving usnow, please make sure you take all of your baggage withyou and have a safeonward journey.SOURCES1 L.A.

So what are these bloodlines and where do theyoriginate?A recurring story with these great civilisations, including Sumer, is thattheybegan at the peak of their powers and then gradually declined, thusindicating a vastinput of knowledge at the start, which was later lost. TheSumerians had their ownexplanations and their accounts were rediscoveredthousands of years later. Theseare the so-called Sumerian tablets and we can nowlook at them in more detail. In themid-1800s and later, tens of thousands ofclay tablets were found in the former landof Sumer on the site of the Assyriancapital city of Nineveh, about 250 miles fromwhat is today Baghdad in Iraq. AnEnglishman, Sir Austen Henry Layard, made thisfirst discovery and others havefollowed. The astonishing accounts the tabletscontain originated in Sumer andnot with the later Assyrian culture. I therefore referto them as the Sumeriantablets. It is estimated that they were buried around 2000BC,but they tell astory that goes back long before, to Atlantis and Lemuria, or Mu. Inmore recenttimes, many books have been written translating their content. Butalthough theseaccounts of Sumer, and far ancient history before the Earth'supheavals, demolishthe official version of events, once again the same old storygoes on being toldto children and students by official academia.You do not have to delve into the translations for long to see that much ofthebiblical Old Testament is simply an edited rewrite of these Sumerian stories.Thetablets talk of how King Sargon was floated on a river in a basket of rushes,as Imentioned earlier. The Bible tells this same story of \"Moses\". The tabletsdescribe aplace called E.DIN (\"The Abode of the Righteous Ones\"). The Biblespeaks of Edenthe garden of \"God\". The story of Genesis is a summary of the samebasic story thatis told in the Sumerian tablets in far more detail.Interestingly, many of the termstranslated into the English version of the OldTestament as \"God\" come from wordsthat actually mean gods, plural, and theSumerians said the founders of theircivilisation were a race of beings that cameto this planet from elsewhere in the6869heavens bringing great knowledge and technology. As I have already indicated,theSumerians called these beings the Anunna and their later Semitic namewasAN.UNNAK.KI (\"Those who from Heaven to Earth Came\") and D1N.GIR(\"TheRighteous Ones of the Blazing Rockets\"). Anunna means \"sons of An\" (laterAnu),1another likely origin for \"Sons of God\" as the reptilian Anunnakiinterbred with theNordics and Earth peoples. The name for Sumer in the tabletsis KI.EN.GIR, whichhas been translated as \"The Land of the Lord of the BlazingRockets\" and also \"TheLand of the Watchers\". The term \"Watchers\" is often usedto describe ancient gods.The Egyptian name for their gods, the Neteru,translates literally as \"Watchers\".The Egyptians said that these Watchers camein their \"heavenly boats\" and inancient cultures across the world you have thisconstantly recurring theme of\"gods\" arriving in some kind of flying machine tofound civilisations and bringknowledge and techniques that were light yearsahead of what existed before. Inthe Indian culture they called these flyingcraft Vimanas. There were several designsof these craft. Some were cigar-shapedwhile others were described as double-decked with a dome and porthole windows.Both types are regularly described inUFO sightings today. The ancient Indiantexts describe anti-gravity technology ofthe type used in \"flying saucers\". Somuch so that when the Chinese discoveredSanskrit documents in Tibet and sentthem to the University of Chandrigarh fortranslation, they were found to containthe knowledge to build interstellarspaceships, according to the University's DrRuth Reyna.2 Yet the documents arethousands of years old! Dr Reyna revealed thatthese ships were known as \"Astras\"and it was claimed they could fly to anyplanet. Some texts talk about them flying tothe Moon. Details of building,flying, and operating the craft are all included. TheChinese, apparently, evenused part of the contents in their space programme.3These were the craft used inthe endlessly recorded \"wars of the gods\". The samebasic knowledge used to buildanti-gravity technology can be employed todisconnect massive stones from thelaws of gravity. Arab legends say that theastonishing blocks of stone atBaalbeck in the Lebanon were laid together by atribe of giants\" after thedeluge. In the same way, British legends tell of giantscoming from Africa tobuild Stonehenge. Was the Golden Age of Lemuria/Atlantisbefore the cataclysmscreated by knowledge brought from the stars and/or evenother dimensions ofexistence far in advance of where the Earth was at the time?This is what the ancient accounts say. These are the same accounts, which, liketheSumerian tablets, describe planets of the solar system in both numberandenvironment in ways that were only confirmed in the 20th century. Theydescribehow these beings, later called \"gods”, the Anunnaki, created a cultureof greatadvancement and technology that was destroyed by Earth catastrophes andflood.The story of the Great Flood is told at length in the tablets. TheSumerian floodhero, Urnapishtim, was replaced by the name, Noah, when the muchlater texts ofGenesis were compiled from the Sumerian records.If these Anunnaki or \"gods\" were indeed so advanced and able to fly, as allthesevarious ancient stories either symbolise or openly confirm, it would be afurtherexplanation for why there could have been a global society during thepre-flood70Children of the MatrixGolden Age and how the same building methods were used across the worldbyapparently unconnected peoples; how the Nazca lines in Peru were createdandfantastic structures like the pyramids could have been built while thegeneralpopulation was technologically \"primitive\"; how those breathtakingancientstructures could be aligned both with each other and the cycles of theSun, Moon,planets and star systems; how ancient peoples knew more aboutastronomy thaneven modern science did until recently, and in some areas, stillso; how the planetwas mapped so accurately thousands of years ago, as proved bythe maps showingAntarctica before the ice came; how peoples in every part of theworld have thesame legends, stories, and basis for their religions; and why, thefurther back yougo, the more impressive are the temples and other structuresthat survive today. TheSumerian tablets suggest that the Anunnaki came to thisplanet hundreds ofthousands of years ago. They would have been very muchinvolved in Lemuria andAtlantis, leading up to great upheavals and the deluge.After the catastrophes, the Anunnaki returned, the tablets relate, andtheysupervised the rebuilding of another global empire, which we know as Sumer.Butalthough this was fine for a while, the gods fought among themselves inthethousands of years that followed, the tablets say. This was especially theoffspringof the earlier leaders, Enlil and Enki. They demanded that humannations fight forthem against other peoples committed to a different Anunnaki\"god\". Thus theSumer Empire, although a wonder for its time, did not reach theheights of theGolden Age and eventually collapsed, breaking up into warringfactions. Many ofthese wars are described in the stories of the Old Testamentwhen it seems everyonewas fighting everyone else in that heart centre of theAnunnaki, the Middle andNear East, from where the major religions have allemerged, including what is nowHinduism. This could also be the reason for thetheme in the Old Testament of\"worship no other god than me.\" Some researchershave even presented evidencethat high-tech weaponry was used in the Anunnakiconflicts, including nuclearwarheads. The Sumerian and Indian accounts givesupport to this. It may be thatthe \"mist\" that poisoned the rivers and watersupplies and left the Sumer region anuninhabitable wasteland for a long time,was the fall-out from this. It is believedthat the Anunnaki eventually left theEarth, but I suggest that while some may havedone so, pledging eventually toreturn, others stayed and have been theorchestrators of the manipulation throughtheir bloodlines and secret societies eversince. The themes of thisextraterrestrial involvement in human affairs can be foundin almost every nativeculture.If anyone has a problem with the existence of life beyond this planet, by theway,consider this. Even according to conventional, and desperately limited\"science\", ittakes a hundred years for light to travel from one side of this oneMilky Way galaxyto another, and this at a speed of 186,000 miles a second! Thereare estimated to beat least a million galaxies in the universe, a billionplanets, and a billion trillion stars.There are a hundred million planets in thevisible universe with conditions verymuch like those on Earth, according to DrMelvin Calvin of the Department ofChemistry at the University of California atBerkeley. And that is only in this one71density or frequency range of existence. Imagine the scale of what must exist inallthe other frequency ranges beyond our physical senses. So given all this, dowereally believe that life as we know it has only evolved on this one littleplanet in thisone little solar system in one galaxy? We do? In that case I havesome seafrontproperty in the Gobi Desert you might like to buy. Very largebeach, too.The Illuminati bloodlinesThrough the 1990s, as I researched the way the world is controlled andmanipulatedtoday, it was clear that for some reason the ruling families andtheir offshoots wereobsessed with interbreeding with each other. The higher yougo in the hierarchy themore this genetic obsession prevails. When you followthese bloodlines back intohistory, you find that they have always interbred withthemselves. The bloodlines ofthe 43 American presidents from George Washingtonto George W. Bush go back toEuropean royal and aristocratic families who havefamously interbred and still doto keep the gene pool \"pure\". Their genealogy,and that of today's key politicians,banking tycoons, business leaders, and mediaowners, continues back even furtherinto the distant past through those Europeanroyal and \"noble\" (Aryan) families tothe ancient kings of Sumer and its empire,not least Egypt. Hold that thoughtbecause it is vital. Perhaps the mostastonishing information in the Sumerian claytablets are the detaileddescriptions of how the Anunnaki interbred with humanwomen to create a hybridrace, a fusion of the genes of humans of the time and the\"gods\". Included in theterm \"human\" are the white or Nordic race, which are also,originally, ofextraterrestrial origin. Yet again, this is a constantly repeated theme ineverypart of the world and can be seen in the Old Testament narrative, taken fromtheSumerian, of the Sons of God (properly translated, the sons of the gods)whointerbred with humanity and created a hybrid bloodline. Genesis recounts:\"When men began to increase in number on the Earth and daughters were borntothem, the sons of God [the gods] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful,andthey married any of them they chose...The Nefilim were on the Earth in thosedays -and also afterwards - when the sons of God [the gods] went to thedaughters of menand had children by them. They were the heroes of old, the menof renown.\"4The term Nefilim can be translated as \"Those Who Descended\" or \"Those WhoFellFrom The Heavens\". The American researcher, David Sielaff, emphasises thattheNefilim or Nephilim are not the sons of the gods (beni ha-Elohim), buttheoffspring of the interbreeding between the extraterrestrials the Bible callstheElohim and the daughters of men. The Illuminati bloodlines that rule theworldtoday, therefore, are the Nefilim, the extraterrestrial-human hybrids. Theywere alsoknown in ancient times as the Rephaim, Emim, Zazummim, and Anakim, allverytall or \"giant\" people in those days.5 The biblical Goliath was a Rephaim,and giantin Hebrew is repha.6 This theme of giants is a constant one. Cavepaintings found inplaces like Japan, South America, and the Sahara Desert,depict giant people withround heads towering over human hunters. Bones of giantpeople between 8 and 1272Children of the Matrixfeet tall have been found in mounds in Minnesota and other locations.TheDelaware Indians speak of a race of giants who once lived east of theMississippi inenormous cities and the same descriptions of giants in ancientlegends and lore canbe found everywhere.7 Scores of giant red-haired mummieswere discovered in acave near Lovelock in Nevada and some were seven feet tall.8The Piute Indianlegends about these giants say they were cannibals. They wouldeven dig up thePiute dead from their graves and eat them, the accounts claim.9Stories of Atlantisinclude tales of red-haired giants who acted like vampires,and the giant Nefilimwere associated with cannibalism and blood drinking - justlike the Illuminatibloodlines are today. Most accounts say that these giantswere unfriendly, evenhostile, to the rest of the population. Often associatedwith these giants are strangecraft that sound very much like the \"flyingsaucers\" of modern UFO accounts.Genesis tells us that the sons of the godsmarried the daughters of men before theflood, as well as afterwards and Numberscalls the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, ordescendants of the Anakim (Anunnaki).10Hero worshipAccording to Zecharia Sitchin, who has written many books on theSumeriantablets, the term \"men of renown\" in the Genesis passage should read,from itsSumerian origin, \"men of the sky vehicles\". This puts rather a differentcomplexionon the whole story and makes a great deal more sense of it. Thereference to\"heroes of old\" is also relevant. The word hero comes from theEgyptian term,heru, which, according to researcher Wallis Budge, was \"applied tothe king as arepresentative of the Sun God on Earth\".11 The precise meaning was\"a humanbeing who was neither a god nor a daemon\".12 The term has the inferenceof acrossbreed race. The writer Homer (8th-9th century BC) wrote that \"theheroes wereexalted above the race of common men\". The poet, Pindar, (518-438BC)- a veryrelevant name for readers of The Biggest Secret - used the term,hero/heru, todescribe a race \"between gods and men\". At this moment 1 have thesong playingin my head that goes \"Search for the hero inside yourself\"! It isextremely likelythat Horus or Haru, the Egyptian son of God and a minor of themuch later\"Jesus\", came from the term heru, which means the Sun God'srepresentative onEarth, the hybrid or Aryan race. There is also the Sumerianword, Hu or Ha,meaning hawk, and the hawk or Sun-hawk was a Sumerian symbol forthe Sun.13The term Nibiri or Nebiru, the alleged home planet of the Anunnakiaccording tothe tablets, is derived from the word found in Egypt, Neb-Heru,according toresearcher and author, Robert Temple.14 He says that Neb-Heru isclearly describedin the Sumerian, Enuma Elish, as a star and not a planet.15Again could the Siriussun or dog star be the true \"Nibiru/Nebiru\"? Maybe, maybenot. Horus, the Son ofGod of Egyptian myth, was strongly associated with Siriusas in Heru-Sept or\"Horus of the Dog Star\".16 One depiction of Horus was asHeru-ami-u, a hawk-headed crocodile with a tail ending as a dog's head. He wasalso portrayed with ajackal or dog/wolf head, as was An or Anu, the royal leaderof the Anunnaki.17Heru = hero = hybrid bloodline and these \"heroes\" may beruling the Earth, at73least in part, on behalf of the Sirius \"gods\". Another definition of the term,hero,is a \"man sacrificed to Hera\", which is again related to Heru/Horus, etc.18Biblical scholars and the dictatorships that control Judaism and Christianityhavealways avoided an explanation of that \"Nefilim\" passage in Genesis becauseit is sodifficult to encompass the contents into the party line. But, hey, theytell us that thisis the literal word of God and He's not going to make acock-up, is He? It's veryclear. Some sort of beings, the sons of the gods, camedown and produced childrenwith Earth women and those children were therefore ahybrid race, the Nefilim. It'sofficial. God said. Over to you, vicar. Or rabbi.Talk us through that one. FlaviusJosephus, the 1st century writer and historian,did offer a comment on this Genesisreference to the interbreeding between \"gods\"and human women:\"...for many angels of God accompanied with women and begat sons thatprovedunjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidencethey had intheir own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did whatresembled the acts ofthose whom the Grecians call giants.\"19The term, angel, which simply means messenger, became associated withthesenon-human entities that interbred with humans. The Sumerian tablets gomuchfurther than Genesis in explaining this interbreeding. They describe howtheAnunnaki systematically set out to create a slave race, later called Homosapiens, toserve their agenda and how they began this quest, amid much trial anderror, usingwhat we call today test-tube methods. This is described in thetablets, and they tellof how the sperm of Anunnaki males was used to fertilisehuman eggs before theywere transplanted to Anunnaki females to be birthed. Allthis appears to have firsthappened hundreds of thousands of years ago, but hascontinued ever since onvarious scales. 1 think many of the stories mentioned inthe tablets refer to events inLemuria and Atlantis. All this makes moreunderstandable the countless stories toldtoday by people claiming to have beenabducted by non-human entities that forcedthem to have sex or took their eggs.The babies that result often disappear in earlypregnancy with no medicalexplanation. Of course, there are many \"abduction\"experiences that are simplyinvented or have other, more earthly, explanations, butto dismiss them all,given their number and often consistency of detail, would bejust as ridiculousas believing every word of every one.The Sumerian tablets tell of how the original breeding programme was headedbythe chief scientist of the Anunnaki, called Enki, or \"Lord of the Earth\" (Ki=Earth), and their expert in medicine, Ninkharsag, also known as Ninti(\"LadyLife\") Mesopotamian depictions portray her holding a horseshoe-shaped toolusedat that time to cut the umbilical cord. Another name later given to her wasMammi,from which came mama and mother. Mama or ma as a term for mother canbefound in various languages all over the world. Ninkharsag would laterbesymbolised in part by the stream of mother goddess deities with names likeQueenSemiramis, Isis, Barati, Artemis, Diana, and the biblical Mary. These werealso usedto symbolise the feminine principle as goddesses of the Moon or waters,which are74Children of the Matrixconsidered feminine in balance to the masculine Sun. There are often twodistinctcamps in these areas of research. There are those who believe that thesedeities wereonly symbolic of astronomical and esoteric principles, and those whosay they wereoriginally flesh and blood extraterrestrial \"gods\" or \"goddesses\".My own view isthat sometimes, not always by any means, it is a combination ofthe two, as somechanged over thousands of years from literal descriptions ofAnunnaki leaders tosymbolic of astronomical and esoteric themes.After many failures and some horrendous creations, Enki and Ninkharsagproduced ahuman hybrid that the Sumerians called a LU.LU (\"One Who HasBeen Mixed\") - whichappears to be the biblical \"Adam\". This was the splicingtogether of the DNA ofthe reptilian Anunnaki with that of the human form knownas Homo erectus. Alsothere was the interbreeding with the Nordics to create theAryan reptilian-Nordic\"master race\", which was designed to rule as the \"middlemen\" or \"demi-gods\"between the Anunnaki and the people. What the Bible calls\"Adam\", the \"firstman\", is likely to be symbolic of \"the Adam\", a genetic streamnot an individual.The biblical \"Eve\" was supposed to have been created from a ribof Adam,according to Genesis, but the word from which \"rib\" derived was theSumerian, TI,which means both rib and life.2\" To be created from the \"life\" or lifeessence ofthe Adamic race makes rather more sense than a rib. In the same way,the \"dustfrom the ground\" from which the Bible claims that Adam was created,reallytranslates as \"that which is life\" from the Sumerian term, TI.IT. As 1 detailinThe Biggest Secret, many investigations into human origins, using the DNAofpeople from different cultures, colours, and races, all point to a singlesource inAfrica around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. This is in line with theclaims of theSumerian tablets. Appropriately, the Sumerian name for humans wasLU, whichhas the root meaning of worker or servant and also implies adomesticated animal,like a sheep. Look around you. Does that not describe thenature of human lifetoday and for a long time past? My own research leads me tothink that claims thatthe Anunnaki created the human form as we know it all overthe world areseriously exaggerated. I think there were many examples ofinterbreeding betweenhumanity and the \"gods\" of various origins and races andnot just the Anunnaki. Itwas more that the Anunnaki created DNA streams orbloodlines to suit theiragenda and they have continued to infuse their DNA intohuman blood streams.They rewire the DNA to close down humanity'sinterdimensional communicationand telepathic powers. This puts us in avibrational prison in which we canperceive only the very narrow frequency rangeaccessed by our physical senses.The suppression of our telepathic powers issymbolised in ancient accounts allover the world as the gods dividing humanpeoples by giving them differentlanguages. I will discuss this further a littlelater. Official history says that certainhuman forms died out to be followed bynew ones and thus Neanderthal man wasfollowed by Cro-Magnon man, and then Homosapiens or modern man. And yet 1archaeologists working in the Middle Eastdiscovered evidence to show that allthese physical forms existed during the sameperiod. The \"missing link\" that wouldconnect them and explain the sudden anddramatic changes and appearance oftheir physical forms has never been found because the establishment ofacademiawould rather stay ignorant than utter the \"E\" word - extraterrestrial.The themes of the Sumerian tablets are supported by Credo Mutwa, one of onlytwosurviving \"sanusis\" left in southern Africa. A sanusi is the peak of theAfricanshamanistic stream. Credo is 79 and the other sanusi. his aunt, is in her90s. He isthe official historian and storyteller of the Zulu nation and the veryname \"Zulu\"means \"People from the Stars\" because they believe they were seededby anextraterrestrial \"royal\" race. With no one for him to pass on hisknowledge, and theurgent need for everyone to know the astonishing informationhe has received in alifetime of initiations, 1 produced two videos with him. TheReptilian Agenda, partsone and two. They last more than six hours and still thatis only a fraction of theknowledge he holds. In the videos he reveals what heonce pledged in hisinitiations never to reveal. But he says that the situationfor humanity is so perilousthat it is far more important for them to know whatis going on than for him to keepsuch vows of silence. This information wentunderground when the Europeansinvaded Africa and their Illuminati leaders, inCredo's words, \"milked the minds ofthe shamen and then killed them\". It wassuicide to talk openly of such things andsecret networks of initiation wereformed to keep it alive. Credo, who has become aclose friend, tells the samestory of the interbreeding between the extraterrestrialAnunnaki and humans toproduce a hybrid race.He also has artefacts like the \"Necklace of the Mysteries\", which confirmthisstory (see picture section). It is an extremely heavy copper \"necklace\" thatactuallyrests on the shoulders and it has been mentioned in records 500 yearsold. Credosays it goes back at least 1,000 years. The large symbols that hangfrom the necklacetell the story of humanity. In pride of place at the front arean extraterrestrial with abig copper willy (in come-and-get-me mode), and anEarth woman into whom theET \"fits”, if you follow me. This is symbolic, Credoexplains, of the union betweenthe people from the stars and humanity, which youfind recorded in virtually everyancient culture. Significantly, he says thecopper willy was once made of gold beforeit was stolen and replaced with copper.This mirrors the ancient Egyptian storyabout the golden penis of their key god,Osiris, which is symbolised by the secretsocieties today, especially theFreemasons, as an obelisk. The way theextraterrestrial is portrayed on thenecklace, Credo says, is merely symbolic becausethese \"gods” were of a verydistinct and unhuman form (reptilian) and they warnedthe people of instant deathif they ever depicted them as they really looked. Thusthe \"gods\" were portrayedsymbolically. Hanging from the Necklace of theMysteries is a large hand, full ofsymbols. Among these are the all-seeing eye,symbolising, Credo points out, the\"Watchers\" (the same as the Illuminati image onthe US dollar bill); also thereis the constellation of Orion, which modernresearchers have constantly connectedwith extraterrestrial activity on Earth,especially the reptilians; and a Star ofDavid, which is not, contrary to acceptedbelief, an ancient \"Jewish\" symbol atall. As some Jewish historians have stated, it isa far ancient symbol found allover the world, and only became associated with theJewish faith when the bankingand Illuminati bloodline dynasty, the Rothschilds,76Children of the Matrixbegan to use it in the 18th century. A researcher who saw the symbols onthenecklace at one of my talks, also saw the connections with the star, Sirius,fromwhich, according to ancient accounts, a reptilian race came to the Earth. Hewrote:\"I noticed that the South African shaman necklace with the carved hand had apictureof Orion on it. Orion's belt points to the binary star Sirius. On thecarved hand, thebelt of Orion points directly to the eye in the centre,suggesting a link between theEye cult and Sirius. Indeed, throughout the historyof occultism, Sirius has been seenas very important, indeed it was a most sacredlocation throughout the ancient world.It is the Star card in tarot, the silverstar of [Aleister] Crowley's A: A: organization[Crowley was a Satanist], thestar to which the Queen's shaft in the Great Pyramidpoints, and the star fromwhich the Dogon of Mali say their alien visitors theNommo came from.\"The Necklace of the Mysteries includes a very clear \"flying saucer\" which,thelegend says, the extraterrestrials flew from their giant \"Mothership\" to landon theEarth. They say the Mothership continued to orbit and it was to there thattheleaders sheltered during the upheavals. In France, cave paintings dated tobetween10,000 and 30,000 years ago include oval and disc-shaped objects standingon tripodlegs with ladders coming down from them. A drawing carved in a cliff atFerganiain Central Asia had a man who appeared to be wearing an \"airtighthelmet\" withsome mechanical device on his back. It was dated to 7000BC. Whateverthe originand nature of \"flying saucers\" and other such craft, they have beenseen andrecorded for thousands of years.The genetic obsessionThe Anunnaki leader called Enki, the \"Lord of the Earth\" and chief scientist,wasnot the top man in the Anunnaki mission to this planet, the Sumerian tabletssay.He was the eldest son of the Anunnaki's overall Mr Big, An or Anu, whomadeonly rare visits to the Earth, we are told by translations. But Enki'syounger half-brother Enlil was made commander of the mission because his motherwasconsidered more genetically pure than the female with whom Anu conceivedEnki.This, the accounts reveal, was to be the cause of ongoing conflicts betweenthe half-brothers, which were to erupt in the wars within the Anunnaki thatstimulatedenormous conflict between their factions within humanity, as describedin OldTestament texts. It is well known by researchers that, although theIlluminati agreeon the overall agenda of global control, they, too, areconstantly at war withinthemselves as different groups and families seek to beat the top of their greasypole. This is no surprise when you consider that theIlluminati is a front for theAnunnaki and the secret society network is theirmeans of covertly manipulatinghumanity and introducing their agenda for aplanetary dictatorship via a worldgovernment, world central bank, world army,and a micro-chipped population. Allof which are getting closer by the hour.These factions within the Anunnaki, andtherefore the Illuminati, are still atwar with each other today. One researcher77described the Illuminati to me like this: \"They are like a gang of bankrobbers.They all agree on the job, but they argue over how the spoils will beshared out.\"This is the Anunnaki and their bloodlines to a tee.Something happened that led the Anunnaki to withdraw from overt control andtomanipulate through certain bloodlines from behind the scenes and the coverofhuman form. It is likely that there were so few of them, as human numbersbegan tosoar again after the catastrophe, that covert control became the onlyoption,especially when their own internal strife, described in the tablets, ledto a period ofutter chaos. The accounts confirm many times (according toSitchin's translations)that the commander of the mission Enlil was alarmed atthe rapid expansion ofhuman numbers and it is even suggested that one majorgeological catastrophe wasmanufactured by the Anunnaki to dramatically reducethe population (just as theIlluminati seek to do today with war, famine, anddisease). The decision by theAnunnaki to withdraw to the shadows could even haveinvolved an outsideintervention of some kind because it is clear that there aremany extraterrestrialgroups with varying agendas at work who find this planet ofgreat interest.Whatever the cause, the Anunnaki went underground, literally andsymbolically,and used certain hybrid bloodlines to do their dirty work in thehuman arena.The \"divine right of kings\" (and presidents, and bankers...)You can appreciate from the genetic reason for Enid's elevation over Enki thattheAnunnaki are fiercely hierarchical and that hierarchy is decided on the basisofbloodline and genetics. Exactly the same theme is followed by the\"human\"bloodlines that have held the reigns of power since the days of Sumer.Throughouthistory the right to rule has been decided by bloodline. For thousandsof years itwas done openly and today it is achieved through covert manipulationand thesecret society web I call the Illuminati. As humanity interbred, thetraits of theAnunnaki were diffused into the overall genetic pool. But certainbloodlines werespecifically seeded by the Anunnaki \"royal\" leadership to betheir front men andwomen who would rule humanity on their behalf and to theiragenda, the accountsreveal. This is the reason for the obsessive interbreedingof the ruling families overthousands of years. The Sumerian texts call theseAnunnaki \"royal\" bloodlines theAB-GAL, the \"Masters of Knowledge\" and the \"sevenelders\", and they apparentlygo back to ten priest-kings before the deluge.Atlantis and Lemuria in other words.They were depicted with fish-like bodies, aswas Enki himself under another of hisnames, Oannes. The fish symbolises theamphibious nature of the gods and that isright in line with the apparentlyamphibious extraterrestrials from Sirius.These \"royal\" bloodlines have worked to maintain their Anunnaki geneticsthroughinterbreeding and others have continued to be seeded for this purpose eversince,hence the stories of humans forced to have sex with, or beingartificiallyimpregnated by, non-human entities. The Sumerian records say thatthe crossbreedhybrids of the Anunnaki were placed into the positions of royalruling powerduring the Golden Age and throughout the Sumer Empire. Thishappened, thetablets document, when Anu bestowed \"Anu-ship\" (later calledkingship) on78Children of the Matrixhumanity by creating the bloodlines to rule on behalf of the gods. Kingship isreallykin-ship - bloodline. This is also the true origin and meaning of theancient themeof the \"Divine Right of Kings\", the right to rule because of yourgenetic history. It isnot the Divine or \"God\", at all. It is the right bestowedby the \"gods\", theAnunnaki, to rule according to their agenda. In reality, mostof the battles betweenkings and queens of various bloodlines to rule variouscountries were acontinuation of the internal tussle for supremacy within theAnunnaki. This appliesto the Stuart and Tudor dynasties in England, forinstance, the battles betweenbloodlines in England and Scotland, and those todaywithin banking, business,politics, and the media. Researcher John A. Keel wroteof these themes 30 years ago:\"In all these legends there is another persistent theme: that the god-kingsmated withmortal women, impregnated them and thus started a royal lineage.Tradition claimsthat the blue bloods of royalty actually had blue blood in theirveins in early history,perhaps as a result of this crossbreeding. Even todaysome royal families suffer fromhaemophilia [and other rare blood diseases]...This ownership [of the planet] waspassed onto human heirs, and for thousandsof years a few dozen families literallyowned the entire planet. Theyintermarried and managed to keep the system goinguntil modern times. Althoughthe king system degenerated slowly, it did not reallycollapse until 1848.\"21But control by these bloodlines only appeared to collapse. They j ust movedfromovert power through royal rule to covert control through politics,banking,business, and media. In Appendix 1 at the back of this book, you willsee just some ofthe famous rulers and influences on the world over thousands ofyears who comefrom the same bloodline, starting with the rulers of Sumer, Egypt,Babylon, andGreece. These were all part of, or the successors to, the SumerEmpire and based onthat same knowledge, culture, and bloodline hierarchy of the\"gods\". As we followthis bloodline through the millennia we find that all 43presidents of the UnitedStates to George W. Bush, the royal families of England,including the House ofWindsor, and those responsible for the creation andimposition of Christianity andother religions, like the Jehovah's Witnesses andthe Mormons. Of those 43 USpresidents since the first in 1789, some 34 areconnected genetically to Charlemagne,the most famous monarch of what we now callFrance, and a major figure in theIlluminati and its bloodlines.22 In the lastweeks of the farcical year 2000 presidentialelection campaign, that \"blue bloodbible\" of royal and aristocratic genealogy,Burke's Peerage, confirmed the themesI am highlighting here. Four years earlier,when Bill Clinton faced Bob Dole,Burkes Peerage said that the candidate with themost European royal genes had wonevery single presidential election in US history.Clinton and George W. Bush havesince continued that unbroken sequence. In aReuter's report of October 17th,2000, Burkes Peerage confirmed that both George W.Bush and \"opponent\" A1 Gorewere of royal descent with Bush the \"bluer\" of thetwo. Purely by knowing hisbloodline and watching the behind-the-scenesdevelopments, I was able to predictthree years before the 2000 election that GeorgeW. Bush would be the next president of the United States. Bush is closelyrelated toevery European monarch on and off the throne including the King ofAlbania andhas kinship with every member of Britain's royal family, the reportsaid. He is a13th cousin of Britain's (seriously reptilian) Queen Mother, andher daughter QueenElizabeth, and is a 13th cousin once removed of the heir tothe throne, PrinceCharles. Bush has a direct descent from Henry 111 and fromHenry Vlll's sister MaryTudor, who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. Heis further descended fromCharles II of England. Harold Brooks-Baker, PublishingDirector of Burke's Peerage,said: \"It is now clear that Mr Gore and Mr Bush havean unusually large number ofroyal and noble descents.\" Only unusual if you don'tknow the story. He added: \"Inpoint of fact, never in the history of the UnitedStates have two presidentialcandidates been as well endowed with royalalliances.\"23 Brooks-Baker said therehad always been a significant \"royaltyfactor\" in those who aspired to the WhiteHouse, with Presidents GeorgeWashington, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin andTheodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan,among others, all boasting blue bloodlinks. He said that A1 Gore, a cousin offormer president, Richard Nixon, was adescendant of Edward I and has directlinks to the Holy Roman Empire throughEmperors, Louis II, Charles II and LouisI. This, therefore, makes him a directdescendant of Charlemagne, the 8th-centuryEmperor.24 These Charlemagne linksmake Gore a cousin of George W. Bush!The Merovingian bloodlineCharlemagne, in turn, takes us into the Merovingian dynasty in France,whichfounded the city of Paris and to whom all the royal families of Europe arerelated.Other highly influential figures of their time, like the founders of theMormonreligion Joseph Smith, Hiram Smith, and Brigham Young are from thisMerovingianline. There have been a number of best-selling books written overrecent yearsabout the Merovingian bloodline and the France-based Priory of Sion,a secretsociety through which this bloodline manipulates. These books havepresentedsome interesting and important information, but they claim that theMerovingiansare the bloodline of Jesus and the children they say he conceivedwith \"MaryMagdalene\". The story goes that she fled with them to southern Franceafter the\"crucifixion\". But there was no Jesus and there was no Mary Magdalene,a fact thatwill become obvious. How do two people who did not exist conceivechildren whobecame the Merovingian line? Beats me. This is a vitally importantbloodline, yes,but not because of Jesus. The Merovingians are Anunnaki hybrids.It is one of theirkey bloodlines. Interestingly, MAG is apparently a code forthe reptilian DNApassed on through the female line and it appears to relate toOrion from what Iunderstand. The Dan Winter website athttp://www.danwinter.com/sitemap.htmlhas a lot of background information to thereptilian-human genetics.The Merovingian bloodline is a constant theme in my research of therulingfamilies. It goes back to the ancient Middle and Near East during theSumerEmpire and almost certainly even further to Atlantis and Lemuria. Thepeople laterknown as Merovingians were involved in the Trojan War (c. 1200BC)between the80Children of the MatrixTrojans and the Greeks in what we now call Turkey. Over time they movedoutthrough the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia under the name Scythiansandinto Europe where they were known as the Sicambrian Franks, the source ofthename \"France\". They were named after Cambra, their tribal queen of the late4thcentury, and Francio, their founder, who claimed to have been descendedfromNoah of the biblical Great Flood.25 Noah is a mythical name, but possiblybased on areal character from the Atlantean period and an Anunnaki crossbreed.It should bestressed here that Noah and Abraham, had they actually existed, werenot Hebrewsbecause there were no Hebrews in this period. The Hebrews were anoffshoot of theSumerian-Egyptian cultures, as outlined by, among others,Professor Cyrus Gordon,in The Common Background Of Greek And Hebrew Civilisation(W. W. Norton andCompany, New York, 1965). To claim descent from \"Noah\" is usedby Illuminatiinitiates to symbolise their genetic connection to the Anunnakibloodline. TheSumerian version of the \"Noah\" story relates his close connectionto the Anunnaki,especially Enki.The Franks called themselves the Newmage or \"the People of the Covenant\"andsettled in Germania (possibly named by the Romans from a word meaning\"genuineones\") with their centre in Cologne. Peoples of the former Sumer Empiremovedinto Europe over many centuries by land. As they travelled they wereknown bydifferent names in different regions. Once more the changing names haveobscuredthe fact that they were the same peoples from the former Sumer Empireand evenfurther back to Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of the names by which theseformerSumerian peoples were known are the Scythians (Saca, Sacki, Sacksen,Saxon),Goths (Gauls), and Cimmerians. The Angles and the Saxons, who combinedto formthe Anglo-Saxons, once again had the same origin, the Aryan race fromSumer andits empire.2\" This exodus into Europe included the people called theSicambrianFranks. Interestingly these Franks also claimed to have lived in ArcadiainGreece, which is a name for Atlantis according to some researchers. TheDanube(Danaan) region was another area where the Sicambrian Franks settled andthisregion has long been connected to the bloodlines and their interbreeding.From thetime of their king called Meroveus or Merovee, who became Guardian ofthe Franksin 488, they became known as the Merovingians. Fegend says thatMerovee was theoffspring of a human mother and a sea creature called Quinotaur,who sounds verymuch like the reptilian Anunnaki known as Enki, Ea, or Oannes,the \"fish god\".Merovee, who was brought up by Chodio, the first king of theFranks, was knownas the \"son of the sea\" and this is the symbolic foundation ofthe Merovingianbloodline so crucial to the Illuminati.The Merovingians founded the city of Paris in the sixth century, which theynamedafter Prince Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy. Prince Paris was one ofthefigures in the Trojan War story, which the Merovingians knew their bloodlinehadbeen involved in. The Merovingians were committed to the worship of Diana,oneof the great goddess figures of the ancient world who was also known asArtemis.This was the same goddess worshipped in Atlantis. The city of Troy, inAsia Minor,now Turkey, is in the same region as Ephesus, a place I have visited,which was the81centre of Artemis (Diana) worship. The Merovingiansfounded Paris on major vortexpoints on the Earth'senergy grid and built underground chambers outsidetheoriginal settlement to harness that energy in theirrituals and sacrifices to thegoddess Diana. That verysite is still an underground chamber. It is calledthePont de L'Alma tunnel where Princess Diana, namedafter the goddess, wasmurdered on Sunday, August31st, 1997. The goddess Diana was symbolically a\"Moongoddess\" and the name Pont de L'Alma meansFigure 15: The three points of the \"blid§e or passage of the Moon goddess\". 1tell theFleur-de-lis, a widely used symbol of story of Diana’s assassination ingreat detail in Thethe Merovingian-reptilian bloodline Biggest Secret,27 whereyou will also see the staggeringobsession that the bloodlines and their Illuminatinetwork have with symbolismand ritual. Everything they do is symbolism andritual, and when you study thissubject it is a very good way to identify theirsignature on global events. Bythe way, Paris and London are two of the mostimportant global centres for theIlluminati and both were founded by bloodlinesfrom Troy. The connection betweenBritain and Troy goes way back, long before thisbloodline became known as theMerovingians. It was a \"royal\" Trojan called Brutus,a relative of Helen of Troy,who sailed west to Britain after the fall of Troy andfounded a city called \"CaerTroia\" or New Troy in around 1103BC. This later becameknown as Lugdunnum andtoday it is called London. This story was told by the12th century chronicler,Geoffrey of Monmouth, and confirmed by the research ofL.A. Waddell, as outlinedin his books.Offshoots of the Merovingian line left northern France and Belgium forScotlandin the 12th century to become famous \"Scottish\" aristocratic families,some ofwhom were Princess Diana's ancestors. This is one reason why Scotland issoimportant to the Illuminati and why we have the biggest secret society in theworldcalled the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. The House of Windsor, who weremostcertainly involved in the ritual murder of Diana, descend from theMerovingians.The three-pointed fleur-de-lis (formerly the Trident of Atlantisand Lemuria)became the symbol of the Merovingian bloodline and so you see itused profuselyby British royalty, on official buildings (like a gate at theWhite House), and inchurches (Figure 15). The bee is also a Merovingian symboland this was associatedwith Artemis (see picture section) and many othergoddesses, including QueenSemiramis in Babylon who is symbolised by theIlluminati as a dove. Thus the doveis another theme of British royalty's ritualironmongery, sorry sacred sceptres. Thereptilian bloodline is supposed to carrysecret esoteric and magical powers (whatthe Nazis called the \"vril\" or \"serpent\"power) and the Merovingians were knownas sorcerer kings\" because of theseabilities. Some of the more amazing of thesepowers we shall discuss later. Keepthe seat belt on for that one. These guys andgals don't interbreed because theyfancy each other - there is a greater purpose andone on which their whole plandepends. The Windsors wanted Diana's genes forPicture #19 [images/img_0019.png]82Children of the Matrixtheir own purposes because she carried a strong DNA connection to theNordics,and the reptilian hybrids need to infuse their bloodlines with that fromtime to timeand therefore you have their obsession with blond-haired, blue-eyed,people. Oncethe offspring were born of Diana's union with Prince Charles she wassurplus torequirements and ritually removed. Christine Fitzgerald, her closestconfidante onesoteric matters for nine years, told me that Diana called herselfthe \"Windsors'brood mare\" because she had realised the game. Now with Dianagone, and havingfulfilled his bloodline duty, Prince Charles can be seen openlywith the woman hewas secretly with throughout his \"marriage”, CamillaParker-Bowles.The Rothschild bloodlineThe Merovingians were supposed to have died out, but in reality only thenamedisappeared, until recently, and not the bloodline. The genetics continuedwith theKing of the Franks called Charles, more famously known as Charlemagne,to whom34 of the 43 US presidents and so many other key figures are related. Hevastlyextended the Frankish domains and ruled as Emperor of the West in thepapalempire created and controlled by the bloodlines descending from theRomanEmpire. These in turn descended from the royal lines of the Sumer Empire,whodescended from Atlanteans, Lemurians and the interbreeding of the Nordicswiththe reptilian Anunnaki. Another of the key names in Illuminati genealogyisAlexander the Great, an ancestor of Charlemagne and all the majorIlluminatifamilies today (see Appendix I). Alexander carried the strongly NordicDNA anddescended from the Viking peoples who settled the Mediterranean and theAegeanafter the Atlantean cataclysms. Alexander ruled Troy at one stage and,before hedied in Babylon in 323BC at the age of 33, his army had seized controlof a vastregion once ruled from Sumer. This included Egypt, Mesopotamia, andinto India.He founded the city of Alexandria in Egypt. He was known as the\"Serpent's Son\"and Alexandria was the \"City of the Serpent's Son\".28 Once againwe see therecurring theme. The legend goes that Alexander's real father was theserpent god,Ammon, and this mirrors the story of Merovee, founder of theMerovingiandynasty. Throughout history, the reptilians have perpetuated their\"purest\"bloodlines by marrying as closely as possible to their own genetics. Itis vital toremember that these bloodlines do not just breed through theirofficial partners.They have stunning numbers of children out of wedlock. Theseoffspring are thenbrought up with names that are different to the majorIlluminati families likeRockefeller and Rothschild. So when one of thesechildren, called Clinton,Roosevelt, or whoever, enters a position of power, thepeople do not relate them tothe Illuminati families because they have adifferent name. But, and I can'temphasise this enough, they are the samebloodline. This is how they hide the tribe,the Anunnaki genetic network.Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, who now lives in America, claims to beanunofficial offspring of Philippe de Rothschild of the French Rothschilds,andworked within the Illuminati Satanic network for most of his life. 1 givemore detailabout his background later. Phillip told me that the key \"Nefilim\"bloodline isconnected to a figure called Aeneas, the alleged head of the Roman Empirethroughhis descendants, Romulus and Remus. The latter are code names for thebloodlineand not real people and that may be the same with Aeneas. The names\"Noah\" and\"King David\" are also used as codes for the bloodline, but they didnot exist in theway they are depicted and portrayed. The legends of Aeneas fitwith the codes andthemes of the Illuminati bloodlines, including his associationwith Troy. Aeneas issaid to have been born in Troy, the city so sacred to theMerovingians and theKnights Templar. In the Hymn to Aphrodite, the Goddessproclaims that Aeneas,the son she has conceived by the mortal Anchises, willcome to rule the Trojans, aswill the generations upon generations that succeedhim.29 The works of the Greekpoet, Homer, who lived around the 9th or 8thcentury BC, is the main source ofinformation about ancient Troy and theconflicts that led to its demise. The twoepics the Iliad and the Odyssey areascribed to him. Modern archaeologicaldiscoveries have confirmed the accuracy ofHomer's work. In the Iliad, Aeneasrecounts his birth and ancestry to hisopponent Achilles on the battlefield at Troy.Aeneas says that he descends from\"divine and immortal stock\" through both hismother and his father. Thisconnection between divine immortality and theAnunnaki under their various namesconstantly recurs in ancient accounts. Aeneassays that his mother is thegoddess, Aphrodite, and his father is Anchises, and hecan trace his lineage backto Dardanus, the son of Zeus and legendary founder ofthe Trojan race (Trojanrace = reptilian-Nordic hybrids, the Aryans or \"masterrace\"). Other accounts saythat Dardanus is the offspring of the union of Zeus andElectra and his originsare in Samothrace, the sacred Aegean island dedicated togoddess worship, fromwhere he migrates to Troad (Troy) in the period of the GreatFlood. One of theoutstanding characteristics with which Aeneas is endowed in theIliad is a closerelationship with the gods. The legends of Aeneas are peppered withreferencesand codes about his genealogical relationship to the \"gods\" and so it isnosurprise that he plays such an important part in the codes and symbolism oftheIlluminati bloodlines today.Phillip Eugene de Rothschild told me that this \"Aeneas\" bloodline became whathecalled the \"Rothsburg dynasty\" - the union of the Bauer-Rothschilds (samefamily,different name) and the Battenbergs. This is the Merovingian bloodline andalsothe line of the Habsburgs, the leading family in the Holy Roman Empireforhundreds of years. This was the medieval state that embraced most ofcentralEurope and Italy from 962 to 1806. The Dutch researcher Frans Kampsuggests thatthe Habsburgs were Nordics who interbred with the reptilians in theancient past.They were also connected to the reptilian House of Lorraine.Phillip Eugene saysthat this \"Rothsburg\" bloodline is known within theIlluminati as the \"Gens\". Thisis a Latin word meaning \"race\", \"tribe\" or \"maleline of descent\" and comes fromthe term gignere - \"to beget\".30 The late LordLouis Mountbatten, a famous memberof the British royal family, and his nephew,Prince Philip, are Battenbergs andIlluminati Satanists. This is why LordMountbatten became Governor of the Isle ofWight off the south coast of England,an extremely important centre for theIlluminati and its Satanists because of itsposition on the Earth energy grid. More84Children of the Matrixabout that in due course. It was Lord Mountbatten who arranged themarriagebetween Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II, after which the royal lineof the UKbecame known as Windsor-Mountbatten. Both the Windsors and theMountbattensare German bloodlines formerly known as the House ofSaxe-Coburg-Gotha andthe Battenbergs. They anglicised their names during theFirst World War againstGermany for public relations reasons, but both of these\"families\" supported theNazis, and Prince Philip was sent to a school in Germanyrun by the Nazi youthprogramme (see ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free and TheBiggest Secret). PhillipEugene, the Rothschild offspring, says of this \"Aeneas\"bloodline:\"Apparently Aeneas embodies all the various bloodlines that must trace theirlineageback through Charlemagne because in him is embodied the confluence of thelineageof both David (Jewish) and Alexander the Great (Aryan). It is the moderndayrepresentatives of these Roman 'Gens' or European monarchs that make uptheruling 'aristocracy' of the revived Roman Empire. These ’royal’ familiesmaintain theirpedigree through endogamy (inter-familial marriages). The firstprototype of theAntichrist [the purest bloodline] was Nimrod, founder ofBabylon. The historical andseminal nexus of this last Roman Empire isCharlemagne and his descendants,people like [Prince] Philip Mountbatten (RexJulius Alexander Battenberg) who is oneof the ruling heads of the JulianGens.\"31The keepers of the secretsThe Priory of Sion, an elite secret society created in the 12th century to servetheMerovingian bloodline or \"Le Serpent Rouge\" (the serpent blood), was verycloselyconnected to the Knights Templar who were, incidentally, officiallyformed at theFrench city of Troyes, named by the Sicambrian Franks(Merovingians) after theirformer home in Troy. The Priory of Sion and theKnights Templar have had theirfeuds and break-ups over the centuries, but, aswith similar conflicts from time totime with the Knights of Malta, these werebattles for supremacy within thebloodlines, not between the bloodlines and anoutside force. Missing this point, Ifeel, has led so many researchers off thetrail. They all have the same basic agendaof global control by the Anunnaki, butthey each want to be top dog. The same istrue with the Rothschilds and theRockefellers, two major expressions of thebloodline today. At the top level, thePriory of Sion, Knights Templar, Knights ofMalta, Teutonic Knights,Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and a long, long, list of others,are the sameorganisation, the all-encompassing network I call the Illuminati. This isnot tobe confused with a group called the Bavarian Illuminati, officially formed onMay1st (a major ritual day) 1776. The Bavarian Illuminati is a strand in theweb,not the web itself.One other point to emphasise as we close this chapter is the constantlyrecurringtheme in this story of the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia. Fromthe earlydays of my research this region has appeared again and again inrelation to thebloodlines, particularly the Aryan Race. Of course, the whiterace is known in NorthBlood brothers 85America as \"Caucasian\". A Swedish contact had a long relationship withRussia'sleading \"UFO expert\", whom she later discovered had secret serviceconnections.She said that he had spoken of the Caucasus Mountains as aninter-dimensionalportal or gateway through which other-dimensional beings couldenter thisfrequency range we call the physical world. This region was also aplace wherebloodlines from the Middle and Near East intermingled and no doubtinterbredwith those from the Far East and northern Russia. Robert Templehighlights in TheSirius Mystery the importance of the Colchis people at the footof the CaucasusMountains and relates them, with persuasive evidence, to theGreek myth of Jasonand the Argonauts, a story which, as he points out, containsmany symbolic codesfor Sirius.32 In the myth, Jason steals the Golden Fleecefrom the King of Colchis. It isin this region that the Georgian people livetheir extraordinarily long lives bytoday's standards and not far to the south isMount Ararat, the place where thebiblical Noah's Ark was supposed to have comesymbolically to rest. The Greekhistorian, Herodotus, said that the people ofColchis, a dark race, were of Egyptiandescent and he was told that they were menfrom the army of the pharaoh,Sesostris, whom, scholars believe, was another namefor Ramses II. This guyappears in the Illuminati bloodline that includes theRothschilds, Rockefellers,Bushes, and the British royal family, etc., etc.The themes summarised here are supported by stories, legends, and accountsacrossthe world, not only in the Sumerian tablets. Renegade insiders andformerinsiders of the Illuminati have also confirmed to me that humanity isindeedcontrolled by a tribe of interbreeding bloodlines that go back to the timeof the SumerEmpire, Atlantis and Lemuria, where they were seeded by a non-humansource.SOURCES1 Flying Serpents And Dragons, p 32 David Flatcher Childress, Ancient Indian AircraftTechnology,http://www.farshore.force9.co.uk/india.htm3 Ibid4 Genesis.

This was the source of theincredibleand magnificent diversity of the human physical form and there areendlessbloodlines among us, not just those of the Anunnaki reptilians.From what 1 gather from my research and insider information, there has beenalong battle in many parts of the galaxy between the blond-haired,blue-eyed\"Nordics\" of Lyra, the Pleiades, Aldebaran and elsewhere, and factionsof areptilian race based in the constellations of Draco and Orion and within theSiriusnetwork. It is possible that at least some of the reptilians originated onthe Earthand were driven out or, literally, forced underground at some point bythe\"Nordics\". This is not to say that all of these peoples are involved, onlythatsignificant groups of them are. This battle on Earth is symbolised bystories such asthe Phoenician \"St George\" defeating the dragon and \"St Patrick\"removing thesnakes from Ireland. But there was also crossbreeding between theserpent race andthe Nordics, which created the hybrid bloodlines thatoverwhelmingly became theruling bloodlines of the Aryan dynasties. Brinsley LePour Trench says in his book.The Sky People (Award Books, New York, 1970) thatthe crossbreeding between theserpent race and the white race began on Marsbefore it was destroyed bycataclysm. Arizona Wilder (formerly Jennifer Greene),a victim of the Illuminatimind control projects and a conductor of theirsacrificial rituals, told me that duringher \"training\" she was told that thereptilians and the Nordics fought on Mars andcrossbreeding took place therebefore they moved to Earth. She says that thereptilians have followed theNordics around the galaxy for aeons because the bloodof blond-haired, blue-eyed,people is very important to them.As 1 said earlier, modern \"UFO\" research has suggested that threeextraterrestrialgroups fundamentally involved with life on this planet are the\"Nordics\",reptilians, and greys, with an \"insectoid\"-type race also involvedsomewhere inthis. It has been further suggested that the reptilians control thegreys, who are alsoa reptilian form as we shall see, and that these groups havean alliance with a88Children of the Matrixfaction of the tall, blond \"Nordics\", so named because of their likeness totheScandinavian race, though much taller. Whatever you may think abouttheextraterrestrial connection, one thing is for sure. The ruling bloodlines ofSumer andits empire were very tall, Aryan types, with blond hair and blue eyes,andthroughout that same empire there was veneration of serpent gods. Is thatreallyjust coincidence?The Nordic connectionPeople all over the world and back into history have claimed to have beenabductedby \"aliens\" of the Nordic and reptilian description. My great friend,Credo Mutwa,the 79-year-old Zulu shaman or \"sanusi\" in South Africa, confirmsthis. When wefirst met back in 1998 he showed me a picture he had painted of thetall, blond-haired, blue-eyed beings that had been seen by black African tribespeoplethroughout that continent long before the white Europeans arrived. Credo,theofficial historian of the Zulu nation, said that when the Europeans firstcame, theblack Africans thought they were the return of these same white \"gods”,which theycalled the Mzungu (see picture section). As a result they called theEuropean settlersby the same name. This was very much the same reaction as theCentral Americanpeoples when Cortes and his Spanish invasion party arrived in1519 and theythought that he was the returning god, Quetzalcoatl. This wasanother goddescribed as tall and white and portayed with reptilian symbolism inhis title of the\"Plumed Serpent\".An American woman told me of an experience her father had in the early 1970sthatstrongly related to an extraterrestrial or other dimensional white race.Theylived in Turkey at the time where he worked at a listening post forAmericanMilitary Intelligence. He came home one night in a terrible state. Whenasked whatwas wrong, he just mumbled: \"The world is not like we think it is.\"Although herarely drank, he asked for a scotch, and then another. As he relaxed,he told hisdaughter of a communication he had taken that day from the pilot of aplane thatwas stationed at the Turkish base. The pilot reported that he wasflying near theNorth Pole when suddenly his engines stopped and all theelectrical systemsswitched off. The plane then gently lowered itself verticallyto the ground and to hisdisbelief a mountaintop opened up and the plane came torest inside. What he sawwas a scene straight from James Bond (which was writtenby former BritishIntelligence agent, Ian Fleming). He got out of the planewondering what the hellwas going on and he was met by tall, blond-haired, peoplewith \"pearl\" colouredskin and \"bluish-purple\" eyes that appeared to beelectrically charged somehow:like laser eyes. (This same description of the eyescan be found in ancient accountsof the gods and the \"children of the gods\".) Thebeings in the mountain all worelong white gowns with a Maltese Cross medallionon a chain - the symbol of theKnights of Malta and widely seen in the symbolismof British royalty. It is also asymbol from Lemuria-Mu, according to JamesChurchward, and 1 have heardbeings of this description associated with Lemuria.The founder of the Mormons,Joseph Smith, a high-degree Freemason and Merovingianbloodline, said he had a\"vision\" on September 21st, 1821 in which he saw \"a messenger sent fromGod\"dressed in a long white robe of \"the most exquisite whiteness\". From this\"vision\"came the Mormon Church, and a stream of religions have been founded onstories,real or otherwise, of similar experiences. Mohammed and Islam is justone example.John A. Keel also highlighted the blue-blond theme in Our HauntedPlanet:\"According to the traditions of many isolated peoples, the first great emperorsin Asiawere god-kings who came down from the sky, displayed amazingsuperhumanabilities, and took over. There was a veritable worldwide epidemic ofthese god-kingsbetween 5000 and IOOObc ...The myths and legends of Greece,India, and SouthAmerica describe their rule. They were taller and more imposingthan the men of thetime, with long blond hair, marble-like white skin, andremarkable powers whichenabled them to perform miracles.\"1The ancients said they had \"marble-like\" white skin and a modern pilotdescribesthese beings as having \"pearl-like\" skin. The pilot's memory was hazyabout whathappened after he first met \"Of blue eyes\" in the James Bondmountain, but heremembered walking into a room and seeing a group of thesebeings sitting arounda conference table. Eventually, he was taken back to his planeand as it rosefrom the mountain his engines and electronics restarted. There aremany modernreports of such beings living within mountains, including MountShasta inCalifornia, where it is said that Lemurians fled before the cataclysms.Now lookat how the ancient Book of Enoch describes the \"Watchers\": \"And thereappeared tome two men, very tall, such as 1 have never seen on Earth. And theirfaces shonelike the Sun, and their eyes were like burning lamps...their hands werebrighterthan snow.\" Some ancient \"gods\" were also called the \"shining ones\". Atheme ofmodern extraterrestrial research, and the reports of abductees, is thatthePleiades star system, the so-called \"Seven Sisters\", is peopled by a blond,blue-eyed,race (and a reptilian one) and once again a reverence for the Pleiadescan be foundthroughout the Sumer Empire and beyond. The Pleiades, in fact, is agrouping ofsome 200 stars and not just the seven with which it is associated.Some suggest thatAlcyone, the brightest star of the Pleiades, is the pivotalcentre of this part of thegalaxy around which our Sun and solar system orbit.Cherokee and Maya legend inNorth and Central America and the Greek historians,Apollodorius and Diodorus,are among those who refer to Pleiadians visitingAtlantis. The Greeks said thatPleiadians had mated with Poseidon, a king ofAtlantis, and the offspringpopulated that society. Diodorus said that two of theseven symbolic \"sisters\" of thePleiades, Celoene and Alcyone, had \"laid with themost renowned heroes and godsand thus became the first ancestors of the largerportion of the race of humanbeings.\" Nordic-reptilian interbreeding? The Lyraconstellation is widely associatedin UFO research and the stories of abducteeswith a blond-haired, blue-eyed race.Aldebaran, a giant red star with a diameterabout forty times that of the Sun, isanother Nordic-related location, not leastwithin the secret society network of theNazis. It is in the constellation ofTaurus and one of the brightest stars in the90Children of the Matrixnorthern hemisphere. Many abductees tell of loving experiences with tall,blondbeings claiming to come from the Pleiades, as they do with somereptilianexperiences, and it is important to stress here, and to keep in mindthroughout thisbook, that 1 am not suggesting for a moment that all of these\"Nordics\" or\"reptilians\" have a malevolent agenda for humanity. Only that somefactions ofthem do. These genetic streams appear to be vast and populate manyparts of thegalaxy, and so, as with humanity, some will have a positive agenda,some will beneutral, and others will desire to control. Researcher Frans Kampbelieves that themore positively motivated Nordic extraterrestrials fled fromAtlantis to theHimalayas and have operated from there ever since.2 Certainlythere are manylegends in that region of the world of tall, blue-eyed,blond-haired \"Supermen\"living under the ground or within mountains, very muchalong the lines of thatAmerican pilot's experience.Many of these entities may not even be of our density or dimension. AsI'veoutlined, creation consists of infinite dimensions of life vibrating atdifferentspeeds. Some beings know how to change their frequency range and dipbetweenthese dimensions, appearing and \"disappearing\" as they movebetweenfrequencies, much like a radio dial. This is why people have reportedseeingentities \"disappear\" before their eyes. They have not, in fact,\"disappeared\" at all.They have left the frequency range that person can access.Credo Mutwa told methat the African accounts of the Nordic Mzungu say they holdsome type of metalball that seems to be related to their ability to appear anddisappear at will (seepicture section). Time as we measure it is also anillusion that imprisons our minds. 1know how hard it is to comprehend this, butpast, present, and future, are allhappening together and thus some of theextraterrestrial visitors, by movingthrough the frequencies in which thesevarious \"stages\" of \"time\" are unfolding,can literally come back from thefuture, or the \"future\" in relation to where we arenow. Time travel is no myth;it's just that the elite don't tell us about it. There arepeople who suggestthat in fact Atlantis and Lemuria were not third-densityrealities, but fourthdensity and that, as a result of what happened, the frequencyfell and everythingbecame denser. Maybe. The \"Fall of Man\", they say, was the fallof the frequencyof the planet from the fourth to the third density as a result of thefantasticevents that destroyed Mars and almost destroyed the Earth. There are somanymaybes and possibilities once you free your mind from the prisons ofconditionedreality.The reptilian connectionThe most prominent theme in this cocktail of extraterrestrial orinterdimensionalraces, in relation to human control, appears to be a faction ofthe reptilian species.Many \"abductees\" who claim to have been kidnapped bynon-human entities, haveindicated that there is a connection between thereptilians, greys, and Nordics. Theysuggest that these types of entities arecollaborating on the same agenda. Othershave said that the reptilians were seenmasquerading as \"Nordics\" by using sometype of hypnotic or holographic field todeceive abductees. One minute they looklike blue-eyed blonds, the next they are reptilians. Once you can change form,ormanipulate the way the observer perceives that form, who the hell knows whatiswhat and who is who? The Anunnaki of the Sumerian tablets were fromthereptilian race, as widely confirmed when you read the ancient accounts.ASumerian tablet dating back to around 3500BC leaves us in no doubt as itdescribesthe arrival of the Anunnaki: \"The reptiles verily descend.\"3 In Hebrewmyth, theBiblical \"Nefilim\", the \"sons of the gods\", are called awwim, whichmeansdevastators or...serpents. The Anunnaki interbreed with Earth races, butespeciallythe Nordics and their offspring, to create bloodlines through whichthey canmanipulate the world while appearing to be human. Even academics like DrArthurDavid Horn, former Professor of Biological Anthropology at ColoradoStateUniversity at Fort Collins, has concluded that humanity was seeded byanextraterrestrial race and that the Anunnaki were reptilian. He, too, believesthatthese same reptilians have controlled the world for thousands of years, asheexplains in his book, Humanity's Extraterrestrial Origins (A. and L. Horn, POBox1632, Mount Shasta, California, 1994).The reptilians, or this manipulating faction of them anyway, have anundevelopedemotional level, along the lines of a crocodile or lizard. They don't feelin thesame way as mammals. They have a sharp mind in an intellectual sense andthatmakes them very efficient in creating and using technology. The computer isavery good example of the reptilian mind at work. It operates very efficientlyup to apoint, but it does not have emotion and is therefore limited in itspossibilities. It isthe same with these reptilian manipulators. They cannotevolve without developingemotionally and they want the DNA of those who havethat dimension of self. Forsome reason, the Nordics' genetic code is mostimportant to them. Also, without thebalance of emotion, the reptilian mind cando the most horrendous atrocities toothers without feeling any compassion fortheir victims. This is how the Illuminatican manipulate wars that kill and maimtens of millions while being emotionallydetached from the consequences forothers of their actions. The same with scientistswho carry out appallingexperiments on live animals while feeling nothing for thesuffering of their\"specimen\". It's the reptilian mind. Frans Kamp, the Dutchresearcher, began hisjourney of discovery after his marriage to a reptoid-hybridwoman ended after 12and half years. His conclusions about the reptilian-Nordicconnection mirror thethemes of my own:\"The humanoid originates from extraterrestrials from the region of Lyra, butthePleiades and Aldebaran are in the game, too. They had original human forminanother density. They were peaceful and had blue eyes and white/blondish hair.Bymixing up their DNA with the reptoids, as naive as they were, thehumanoidscharacter changed and they got reptoid qualities of character. This wasthe fall ofthe human. It is a natural thing. It happens to this very day. Butthe formerancestors of humans knew. They forbid having sex with other entitiesor species.Without controlling the breeding process, the reptoids know thehumanoid willprevail...Don't forget, reptoids are afraid of humans. Very afraid.They feel, the92Children of the Matrixvery little they do feel, inferior to humans. The reptoids are desperate. Theyarelosing. The Third World War, if it comes, shall be a DNA war because thereptoidswant human DNA.\"4We can see the DNA genetic code agenda very clearly today with thecloningexplosion and the way human genes are now being openly manipulated likeneverbefore, at least in known history. Human cloning has been going on intheunderground bases for decades. When researchers said this some years ago,peoplejust laughed. They have stopped laughing now because it is in their face,but such isthe depth of human robotic conditioning, they now laugh at everythingelse that isdifferent to their programming and will continue to do so untilthat, too, is undertheir noses. In fact, I say cloning has been happening fordecades, it is probablythousands of years. There are many ancient stories thatindicate the existence ofunderground cloning laboratories designed to create agroup of identical people. TheNordics were one of the key extraterrestrial racesinvolved with Lemuria and Atlantisand there are many stories that, way back,they went to war with the reptilians andforced them to flee underground, toother locations in the universe, and to otherdimensions or densities. Thereptilians have been working ever since to regain controlof the planet theybelieve to be theirs and interbreeding with the \"royal\" bloodlines ofthe Nordicswas the most effective means of doing this for reasons we shall explore.T. W.Samsel, the author of The Atlantis Connection, has come to similar conclusions:\"When the 'gods' began to physically interbreed with the Atlantean people, weseethe introduction of the 'royal lineage', the 'royal bloodlines' that were putintopositions of power and rulership over the Atlantean people so long ago.Those of theroyal bloodline were looked upon as gods by the general populationof Atlantis of thetime. These ruled Atlantis until the event of the first greatcataclysm, which broughtthe Lemurian-early Atlantic age to a close. That thereptilian influence over humanityin this area took place in a similar manner, atroughly the same point in time orshortly thereafter, is...likely to be the case.\"The human race has been influenced and controlled since approximately70,000years bce or midway through the Lemurian-early Atlantic age. This involvedseveralextraterrestrial groups and should not be attributed to a single group inand of itself.There were the three main participants in the direct contactprogram who initiatedthis type of manipulation and others. That the reptiliansperformed a similarresearch, for their own purposes and even infiltrated thefederations project security,most likely did take place.\"5My own feeling, however, is that the closer we have come to the present day,themore the reptilians have become the dominant force in this manipulation.Throughtheir interbreeding programmes they infiltrated the bloodlines of theNordics andcovertly changed their DNA and became their \"royalty\". I found directreferences tothis theme in the Indian (formerly Indus Valley) works, like theBook of Dzyan, one93of the oldest of Sanskrit accounts, and the epics, Mahabharata and theRamayana.The Book of Dzyan tells of how a reptilian race it calls the Sarpa orGreat Dragonscame from the skies to bring civilisation to the world. The delugethat ended theGolden Age, it says, wiped out a race of \"giants\" (Nordics?) butthe serpent godssurvived and returned to rule. They are described as having the face of a human,butthe tail of a dragon.6 Their leader was called the Great Dragon and this isthe originof Pendragon (\"Great Dragon\") the title of the king of kings inancient Britain. TheIlluminati's Ku Klux Klan, created by that infamousFreemasonic \"god\" in America,Albert Pike, still uses the term Grand Dragontoday. The Indian-Hindu name for theAnunnaki hybrids was the Nagas and they werealso known as the Dravidians (soclose to the Branch Davidians who died at Waco)and the Dasyus. JamesChurchward's research says the Nagas came from Lemuria.Like the Nommo fromSirius and the Annedoti of Babylonian legend, the Nagas weresaid to have a closeconnection to water and entered their underground centresthrough wells, lakes andrivers. The same was true in China of the Lung Wang or\"Dragon Kings\" who weredescribed as part human, part serpent. The Nagas weredescribed as offspring fromthe interbreeding of humans with the serpent gods. Atfirst it seems this unionhappened with a dark race, the black, Negro-like, Earthpeople I mentioned earlier,because the hybrids were described as dark-skinnedwith a flat nose. This soundsvery much like the faces depicted at ancient sitesin South and Central America.However, the two Indian epics also refer to how the reptilian Nagasintermingledwith the white peoples and although their relationship was often oneof conflict anddistrust, the two interbred, the epics report, to produce areptilian-mammal hybridthat became., .the Aryan kings!7 These are the \"divine\"royal bloodlines or \"demi-gods\" and they are the same bloodlines that ruled theSumer Empire and to whomthose in power today are related. In Media, now Turkey,the Iranians knew the kingsas Mar, which means snake in Persian (Mars =snakes?). They were called the\"dragon dynasty of Media\" or \"descendants of thedragon\".In the late 19th century. Colonel James Churchward, an ardent researcher intotheexistence of Mu or Lemuria, was shown some ancient tablets in the secret vaultofa monastery in northern India. They told the story of how the Naacals orNagaMayas (\"serpents\") from the continent of Lemuria-Mu had travelled to IndiaviaBurma to establish a colony there. Churchward put the texts together in yearsofpainstaking work and revealed how they described the destruction of Mu,theMotherland, and how the Naga Mayas or Nagas had travelled to India.8 TheVedicscholar David Frawley explains how the ancient Hindu holy books, the Vedas,reveal that the earliest royal bloodlines of India, the priest-kings, descendfrom theBhrigus who arrived from a place across the sea. The Bhrigus were an order ofadepts initiated into the ancient knowledge. Frawley says in his book, Gods,Sages,And Kings: Vedic Secrets Of Ancient Civilization (Passage Press, Salt Lake City,Utah,1991) that the monarchs of these bloodlines included the \"serpent king\"Nahusha.They expanded into the five tribes that populated a large part of theIndianPopulation.\" James Churchward wrote a number of superb books on thecivilisationof Mu and he says the Nagas also populated China, Tibet, and partsof Asia. The94Children of the MatrixNaga Maya, with their mother goddess religion, were also the origin of theMayapeople of Mexico. Researcher Michael Mott writes in Caverns, Cauldrons,AndConcealed Creatures (Hidden Mysteries, Texas, 2000):\"The Nagas are described as a very advanced race or species, with ahighly-developed technology. They also harbor a disdain for human beings, whomthey aresaid to abduct, torture, interbreed with, and even to eat. Theinterbreeding hassupposedly led to a wide variety of forms, ranging fromcompletely reptilian to nearly-human in appearance. Among their many devices are'death rays' and 'vimana', orflying, disk-shaped aerial craft. These craft aredescribed at length in many ancientVedic texts, including the Bhagivad-gita andthe Ramayana. The Naga race is relatedto another underworld race, the Hindudemons, or Rakshasas. They also possess, asindividuals, \"magical stones\", or a'third eye' in the middle of their brows, known tomany students of easternmysticism today as a focal point for one of the higherchakras, or energychannel-points, of the human(oid) nervous system - the chakraassociated with'inner visions', intuition, and other esoteric concepts.\"10The theme of ruling \"royal\" families and emperors claiming descent, andtheirright to rule, from the \"serpent gods\" can be found across the ancientworld. Thesebloodlines and connections were symbolised by royal emblems in theform of adragon, snake, sphinx, plumed serpent, or the tree-cross or Ankh. InEgypt they hadan order called the Djedhi (Jedi in Star Wars?) and the Dj meantserpent.11 Thus wehave pharaohs of the serpent line called Djer, Djoser, andDjederfra. In India, theBuddhist text, The Mahauyutpatti, lists 80 kings whodescended from the Nagas or\"serpent kings\". Hindu legend says that the Nagascould take a human or reptilianform at will. This is what is called\"shape-shifting\". Across India the rulers claimedpower because they descendedfrom the Nagas. Buddha is claimed to have been ofthe royal line of the Nagas,but then anyone said to be of a royal line in India wouldhave to be so. It wasthe Nagas who established what is now Kashmir and again theruling bloodlinesdescended from them. The Chinese emperors were the same. Theywere known as Lungor Dragons and many of the earliest emperors were depictedwith reptilianfeatures, very much like the Nagas. One of them, called Huang Ti, wassaid tohave been born with a \"dragon-like countenance\". It was claimed that hewasconceived by a ray of golden light that entered his mother's womb from theBigDipper constellation.12 The Big Dipper includes the star Alpha Draconis, thestar ofSet in Egypt. Alpha Draconis is an alleged base of the \"Draco\" reptilian\"royalty\". OneChinese legend says that when he died Huang Ti transformed into anetheric dragonand flew to the realm of the immortals. The priest kings of thePeruvian Incas weresymbolised by the snake and they wore bracelets and ankletsin the image of a snake.The earliest of the royal bloodlines of Central Americaclaimed genetic descent fromthe serpent gods, Quetzalcoatl and Itzamna. In theMycenaean age in Greece thekings were, in the words of author Jane Harrison,\"regarded as being in some sense asnake\".13 Cecrops, the first Mycenaean king ofAthens, was depicted as a human witha serpent tail. Another, Erectheus, whofounded the Eleusinian Mystery School, was95worshipped as a live snake after his death and, according to legend, KingKadmusshape-shifted into a live snake when he died.14 The symbolism of theserpent lineageof the ancient royal bloodlines can be found on every continent.Iran is another example. The Arab poet Firdowsi, in his Shahnemeh or BookofKings, the legendary history of Iran completed in AD1010, tells the story ofthe birthof Zal, the \"Demon\" or \"Watcher\" offspring, whose appearance horrifiedhis father,King Sam. According to Firdowsi, this Watcher hybrid called Zalmarried a foreignprincess named Rudabeh, a descendant of the \"serpent king\",Zahhak, who wassaid to have ruled Iran for a thousand years. Rudabeh isdescribed as tall as a teaktree and ivory-white. These are the familiar featuresof the \"Watcher\" offspring inthis ancient period. The royal or tribal rulers ofChina, Africa, the Near and MiddleEast, Europe, Asia, people of every colour andcreed, have claimed their right torule by their descent from the serpent gods.As we've seen, Alexander the Great,one of the most famous monarchs andconquerors of all time, was known as the\"Serpent Son”. Alexander is extremelyimportant to the Nordic-reptilian genealogyof the Illuminati bloodlines (seeAppendix I). The legend goes that Alexander's realfather was the serpent god,Ammon, who had mysteriously slid into his mother'sbed and conceived him.15 Thesame story was told of the conception of Merovee, thefounder of theMerovingians. This symbolism is supported by many ancient andmodern accounts of\"virgin birth\" impregnations by reptilian beings. The stories ofwomen beingabducted by reptilians and then finding themselves pregnant are toldtoday allaround the world. Often, as the Zulu shaman Credo Mutwa reveals fromtheexperience of African women, the baby \"disappears\" from the womb duringthepregnancy. The Anunnaki interbred with all genetic streams and those werethepeople who ruled by right of their bloodline in their particular countriesandcommunities. So while the people believed they were being ruled by their ownrace,they were ruled by the same tribe. The hybrid reptilian-mammals ruled themall.Exactly the same continues to happen today with these hybrids in control ofthewhite peoples and the Arab, Asian, Jewish, Chinese, Central and SouthAmericannations, and so on.1 mentioned earlier that being \"descended from Noah\" is a code for theIlluminatibloodlines and when you scan the ancient books and texts you find somestrangereferences to his birth. An Ethiopian text, the Kebra Nagast (Nagas?),isthousands of years old, and it describes the enormous size of the babiesproducedfrom the sexual union of human women and the \"gods\". It tells of how\"... thedaughters of Cain [Nordics] with whom the angels [Anunnaki] hadconceived...were unable to bring forth their children and they died\". Itdescribes how some ofthe babies had to be delivered through caesarean birth:\"...having split open thebellies of their mothers they came forth from theirnavels\". Another story relates toNoah, the Semitic name for the Sumerian floodhero, Utnapishtim. The ancientHebrew text, the Book of Noah and its derivative,the Book of Enoch, refers to thebirth of Noah and sections also appear in theDead Sea Scrolls, found in Israel in1947. The Scrolls are connected with theEssene community in Palestine 2,000 yearsago. Noah is the son of Lamech and heis described as unlike a human being and96Children of the Matrixmore like \"the children of the angels in heaven\". And we know who theywere.Lamech questions his wife about the father of Noah: \"Behold, I thought thenwithinmy heart that conception was (due) to the Watchers and the Holy Ones...andto theNephilim...and my heart was troubled within me because of this child.\"Lamech'schild, Noah, was white-skinned and blond-haired with eyes that made thewholehouse \"shine like the Sun\".16 The highest level of the reptilian \"royalty\"are knownamong UFO researchers and a number of abductees as the \"Draco\" aftertheir\"home\" base in the Draco Constellation. These entities are described asbeing albinowhite and they project something akin to a laser-type beam fromtheir eyes, just likethe pearl-skinned chaps in the James Bond mountain. Enlilwas the leader of theAnunnaki on Earth, according to the Sumerian tablets, andthey refer to him as the\"splendid serpent of the shining eyes\". This is a commondescription of the hybridbabies in these times and I have heard the same storytold today, also. As I saidearlier, Frans Kamp, a Dutch music teacher turnedfull-time researcher, was marriedto a woman he later realised was a reptoidhybrid. He told me that he experiencedthe shining eyes of his former wife:\"One evening we had a disagreement. She didn't get what she wanted and gotverymad. She smashed the door to go away to her own apartment. I followed heroutside.At that moment it was already dark. I saw her walking to her car and shegrabbed thecar door and then it happened. Her eyes lit up. There came light outof her eyes. Shewent into the car and her eyes shone over the bonnet and even onthe ground next tothe car. I looked at it, astonished, but, strange, it wasn't ashock. More aconfirmation, an 'I thought so', a ’you see!'\"17According to the Book of Genesis, Noah got seriously drunk on wine andcollapsedin his tent. Ham, his son, walked in and saw his father naked. He told histwobrothers before finding a cover for his father and when Noah found outhelaunched into a rage and put a curse on Ham and his son Canaan. Could thebigdeal here be that Ham saw something about Noah's body that indicated he wasachild of the gods? It appears that some of the hybrids this far back in historystillhad clear reptilian features, especially some sort of scaly skin on thechest. In theHindu classic, the Mahabharata, a \"demi-god\" hybrid called Kama wasborn fromthe union between an Earth woman and the Sun god, Surya. The child isdescribedas being \"clad in a coat of armour, like a divine being\". By the timeof \"Noah\", justbefore the final Atlantis cataclysm, humans were rebellingagainst the control of theAnunnaki-Nefilim and those of the hybrid bloodlinewere seriously unpopular.They were said to wear the \"badge of shame\", whichcould have been a patch ofreptilian skin, particularly on the chest. TheAnunnaki \"gods\" began to hide theirtrue nature for the same reason and operatedbehind the cover of the human-reptilian priesthood who were the only peopleallowed to \"approach God\" (thegods). The Slavonic Book of Enoch says that whenNoah's nephew, Melchizedek,was born ”... the badge of the priesthood was on hischest and it was glorious inappearance\".lxI have heard the same phenomenadescribed in modern accounts.Frans Kamp's wife worked as a photo model. He told me that her skin took onastrange hide-like appearance:\"My wife had a skin-reflection or should I say hide problem? The skin isextremelyimportant for photo-models. The first thing photographers look at isthe skin. Nowthis skin-problem had the property that her skin got red spots andafter a whilechanged into horny-like slices. We went to the biggest professor inthe university inUtrecht. He didn't know what it was. They did all kinds oftests, but they had noexplanation of it.\"19According to ancient texts, Noah said that the people must not know aboutthechild Melchizedek, because they would kill him if they saw his strangeappearance.The \"badge of the priesthood\" was the same as the divine right torule, it was codefor the reptilian bloodlines. The priesthood of Melchizedekbecame one of the mostfamous and powerful, and today the highest level of thehierarchy of the MormonChurch is called the Melchizedek Priesthood. The MormonChurch is a 100%-ownedsubsidiary of the Illuminati reptilians, and the MormonTemple in Salt Lake City,Utah, sits atop an underground reptilian base, saymilitary insiders. The MormonChurch is a front for widespread Satanic activityand rituals among its ruling elite,although the vast majority of Mormons have noidea that this is going on. They arejust the sheep controlled by forces they donot understand. And who started theMormons? Joseph Smith, Hiram Smith, andBrigham Young. They were all high-degree Freemasons and from the Merovingian(Anunnaki) bloodline.This theme of reptilian-human hybrids can be seen in the story of Adam and Eveinthe Garden of Eden (Edin to the earlier Sumerians - \"the Abode of theRighteousOnes.\") In Jewish lore, Eve, who was tempted by the serpent, of course,was theancestral mother of the Nefilim and associated with the Hebrew wordsmeaning lifeand snake.20 Satan (\"The Adversary\") is described in the OldTestament and theHebrew Torah as the \"Old Serpent\" or \"Dragon\" and he was saidto be the ruler ofthe Nefilim who fled within the Earth after losing a cosmicbattle for supremacy.The Hebrew name for Eve's tempter is Nahash, which besidesits translation asserpent also reads: \"He Who Knows Secrets\", another theme ofthe reptilian gods.21Enoch, like Noah, was said to \"walk with the gods\", and theancient Book of Enochsays that a Watcher who revealed secrets to humans wascalled Gadreel. This is a\"fallen angel” who has been identified with the serpentwho tempted Eve and he isa blueprint for a number of later deities who tookknowledge (often symbolised asfire, illumination) from \"the gods\" and gave it tohumans.Adam and EveAs I've suggested, the Biblical Adam and Eve were probably not individuals,buthybrid genetic streams, as in \"the\" Adam and \"the\" Eve. At first theinterbreedingproduced a very reptilian offspring...thus \"God\" (the gods) mademan in his (their)image. This is where the otherwise unexplainable reference inthe Bible to \"Let usmake man in our image\" comes from.22 In this period, asconfirmed in the Sumerian98Children of the Matrixdescriptions, the Adam and the Eve were cloned and could not reproduce.Thiscaused problems for the Anunnaki because they could not create enoughworkerslaves for the agenda they had planned for the Earth. Eventually the humanslaveswere given the ability to procreate and this involved an infusion of farmoremammalian genes, according to R.A. Boulay in his excellent andhighlyrecommended book. Flying Serpents And Dragons, Mankind's Reptilian Past(TheBookTree, USA, 1997). This change from clone to pro-creator is presentedsymbolically inthe Garden of Eden story with Eve being condemned to suffer thepains ofchildbirth. Sex between their creations was the \"forbidden fruit\"symbolised in theEden story, Boulay suggests. The \"god\" responsible for thisdevelopment was Enki.He was the serpent in the garden \"tempting” Eve and he waslater to becomeextremely unpopular with the rest of the Anunnaki leadershipbecause of theexplosion in the human population that followed, the Sumeriantablets tell us.Incidentally, Enki, the expert in advanced science and medicine,was symbolised astwo serpents intertwining around a staff that could wellsymbolise the reptilianDNA. We call this the caduceus and it is the symbol oftoday's medical profession.No accident. This evolution from outwardly reptilianto outwardly mammalian isdescribed in the ancient Hebrew work, the Haggadah(\"The Telling\"), acompendium of Hebrew oral traditions going way back. It says:\"Before their bodies had been overlaid with a horny skin and enveloped with acloudof glory. No sooner had they violated the command given them that the cloud ofglory and the horny skin dropped from them and they stood there in theirnakednessand ashamed.\"23This fits with the legends which say that before the \"fall\", people, or \"Man\",hadskin \"as bright as daylight and covered his body like a luminous garment\".24Thislater disappeared, but there were remnants of it among the hybrids at thetime of\"Noah\" and the deluge. Still today, some people involved in governmentgeneticexperimentation tell me they have developed patches of reptilian skin. Itwas withthe infusion of mammalian genes that the life spans began to fall fromthousands ofyears, claimed in the records of the pre-deluge era, down tohundreds at the time of\"Noah\" with the reptilian appearance continuing to fade.The reptilian \"gods\" havealways been associated with enormous life spans and theserpent was a Sumerianand Egyptian symbol of immortality. They are not immortalin physical form. It justseems like that to those who live much shorter physicallife spans. Another earlyfigure of significance would seem to be a guy known asJared, the father of Enoch,and the first of the Patriarchs who did not marry hissister in the line with theAnunnaki's recorded custom of producing children withtheir sisters and childrenfor genetic reasons. It was during the period ofJared, way back in the Golden Age,that the Nefilim, the so-called sons of thegods (also \"Angels of the Lord\" in otherversions), appeared on the scene to\"marry\" human women. Today, in the UnitedStates, there is apparently anorganisation called the Sons of Jared who pledge an\"implacable war againstdescendants of the Watchers who ...as notorious pharaohs,kings and dictators, have throughout history dominated mankind\".Theirpublication, The Jaredite Advocate, condemns the Watchers as being \"...likesuper-gangsters, a celestial Mafia ruling the world\".The Anunnaki have been protected from exposure all this time by the \"middlemen\"they have placed between themselves and humanity. 1 call this thehybridPriesthood. In ancient times the hierarchy of the priesthood were the onlyonesallowed to \"see God\" (the gods). The Levite priesthood of the Hebrews isjust oneexample of how only the priests were allowed to approach the deity, asoutlined inthe Hebrew Torah. According to various descriptions, even most of theSumerianpriests never looked the gods in the face. The priests controlled alltheadministration of the state on behalf of the unseen gods. What wasYahweh-Jehovahalways saying? He must not be seen: \"...you cannot see my face,for man may notsee me and live\".25 This was possibly one reason for the ban onthe making of\"graven images\" of the gods. Yahweh-Jehovah has also beenassociated with areptilian in some versions. The Sumerian tablets describe howtheir cities wereoverlooked by a large stepped pyramid or \"ziggurat\" close tothe temple andpalace. At the top of the ziggurat, the tablets reveal, was the\"holy of holies\" or\"cella\" where the gods \"lived\". Here the humans chosen bytheir genetics werebrought to have sex with the Anunnaki \"royalty\" and producethe bloodlines thatbecame the kings, queens, and leaders of all sections ofsociety - the same situationthat we have today. The ziggurats were oftenreferred to as \"mountains\" and thisled to some of the gods being called so andso \"of the mountain\". The layout of theziggurat symbolised so perfectly thepyramid structure of our society in which thefew at the top administer theglobal prison that the Anunnaki have created tocontrol us. This is the structurethrough which their very existence is kept secret.Today's hybrid priesthood canbe found throughout politics, business, banking, themedia, and, especially, inthe highest ranks of the secret society network.As there are not many of these reptilians and their purest bloodlinescomparedwith the human population, they have had to work and manipulate tointroduce astructure of society in which (a) the key decisions are made by fewerand fewerpeople as power is continually centralised and (b) humanity ismanipulated topolice itself and keep each other in a mental and emotionalprison. The reptiliansappear to take three expressions. There are physicalbeings who live mostly withinthe Earth (inner-terrestrials); physical beingsthat come from the stars(extraterrestrials); and non-physical beings, the realcentre of power, which exist onother frequencies and use their hybrid bloodlinesto manipulate unseen. Thereptilians have worked this scam in many parts of thegalaxy, it would seem. It allsounds utterly bizarre and ludicrous. 1 understandthat reaction and yes it is bizarrefrom a conditioned perspective.Unfortunately, it is not ludicrous. If only it was. TheLas Vegas-based JohnRhodes, a long-time researcher into the reptilianPhenomenon, summarises hisconclusions like this:\"From their underground bases, the reptilian military ETs...(establish)...anetwork ofhuman-reptilian crossbreed infiltrates within various levels of the surfaceculture's100 Children of the Matrixmilitary-industrial complexes, government bodies, UFO/paranormal groups,religiousand fraternal (priest) orders, etc. These crossbreeds, some unaware oftheir reptiliangenetic 'mind control' instructions, act out their subversiveroles as 'reptilian agents'setting the stage of a reptilian-led ET invasion.\"26That last comment remains to be seen, blit you will see revealed here thestreamof evidence to show that the basis of what John Rhodes suggests is true. Ihad astrange meeting with him in Las Vegas and his family backgroundapparentlyconnects into the CIA airline during the Vietnam War, Air America. Iam wary of hisagenda to be honest, but his themes, as quoted, are supported byendless evidence.The fairy folkThe tales of underground worlds inhabited by fairies, elves, goblins,demons,dragons, and other non-human communities abound in folklore across theworldand they were often known as the \"shining ones\", the same as the Anunnakiandthe \"gods” under other names in ancient texts. Even a brief glance at thebasicthemes of these stories confirms that they are talking about thesame\"extraterrestrials\" that abductees and researchers of today's undergroundbases aredescribing. The name in Norse folklore for this underground world ofcaverns,tunnel networks, and even vast cities, is Niflheim. The close similarityto Nefilim isobvious and they were said to reside within the Earth. The Norsepeople said thatNiflheim was ruled by the death goddess, Hel. These subterraneannetworks couldbe accessed through the mounds and hill forts built by theancients and themountains, hills, and lakes they held to be sacred. These \"fairyfolk\" in all theirnames and guises were said to interbreed with humans to createhybrid bloodlines,abduct surface people, drink human blood, and take humanreproductive materials.Sound familiar? And the main form in which these\"fairies\" and \"elves\", etc.appeared was reptilian. Elf or elven is still one ofthe Illuminati code names for thereptilian bloodlines. The tales of non-human\"gods\" living within mountains orhaving their subterranean complexes enteredthrough mountains is likely to be theorigin of the endless myths about \"holy\" or\"sacred\" mountains. Mount Olympus,the home of the Greek pantheon of gods, is oneexample. Zeus, their king of thegods, was said to come down from the mountain toseed children with humanwomen. Meetings between the mythical Moses and his godwere often associatedwith mountains. 1 will investigate these ancient and modernconnections betweenmodern \"extraterrestrials\" and the folklore \"fairies\" laterin the book.27The Anunnaki warsThe Sumerian tablets, according to translators like Zecharia Sitchin,* tell ofwarsbetween Anunnaki factions. The tablets say that the Anunnaki leadership,like Enlil* For some inexplicable reason, Zecharia Sitchin refuses to accept the existenceof a serpent orreptilian race in the ancient world, despite the mountain ofevidence. During a conversation withme in Cancun, Mexico, in 1998, he told methere was no evidence of such a race. Later heleaned forward across the tableand said: \"Don't go there\". As you can see, I took his advice.and Enki, eventually gave much greater power to their children, who wereassigneddifferent parts of the world to rule and develop. Nannar, the eldest sonof Enlil,ruled Mesopotamia, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria from the city of Ur, weare told.The crescent moon was his symbol and this was inherited by Islam.Nannar wasknown as Sin in the Semitic language and it is from this name of areptilian god thatwe get Sinai and the Christian term \"sinner\" or \"to sin\". TheChristian cross was thesymbol of U-TU \"the shining one\" and known to the Semitesas Shamash. He wasthe grandson of Enlil and son of Sin, the tablets tell us.Shamash ruled the Lebanon,then a place of enormous forests, and his capital wasBeth-Shamash (\"House ofShamash\"), which we know better as Baalbek. This is wherea fantastic structurecan be found to this day with its giant stones weighingmore than three jumbo jets.Enid's younger son was given control of Anatolia, nowTurkey. This was Ishkur or\"He of the Mountain Land\" and he became the god of theNordic-Aryan Hittites.The Old Testament calls him Adad and the Hadad. R.A.Boulay believes this is alsothe Hebrew god, Yahweh/Yahveh or Jehovah. Thedaughter of Sin, known asInanna or Ishtar (Semitic), was a warrior goddess deityof many lands underdifferent titles. Ishtar's symbol was the lion and also thePleiades and Venus.Together with Sin (Shamash) and Ishkur (Adad), she becamepart of another ancienttrinity of gods under many different names. Sin was thefather, Ishkur the son, andIshtar the female. From Ishkur and Ishtar, we get theNew Age myth of the \"AshtarCommand\". Many New Agers claim this is a force ofextraterrestrial \"saviours\"who are preparing to take the chosen ones off theplanet when the brown stuff hitsthe spinning propeller. A sort of Jesus with aspaceship.Other front-line figures in this next generation of Anunnaki leaders afterthedeluge included Marduk, son of Enki, the tablets say. Marduk was the godofBabylon. The ancient texts, tablets, and legends describe how these godsembarked ona battle for power that brought the world to its knees. Some of theseconflicts, withhumanity used as battle-fodder, are featured in the OldTestament. One definingevent described in the tablets involved the Anunnaki\"god\" known as Sin. The namecomes from the Sumerian SW-EN or ZU-EN, as Boulayreveals in Flying SerpentsAndDragons, and Sin clearly appears to be the \"villain\" of the Sumerian storycalled \"TheMyth of Zu\". In this, Zu (Sin), the \"evil dragon\", tries to seizecontrol of the Earth andthe Anunnaki leadership by stealing \"power stones\",which the accounts refer to asthe ME (pronounced \"may\"). For some reason theseappear to be fundamental to theAnunnaki control and could have been computerchips or programmes, or some typeof crystal. There are indications that theyshone or emitted light in some way. Scholarstranslate the ME as tablets ofdestiny or divine powers, and 1 wonder if these could berelated to the \"Ark ofthe Covenant, a device for which divine powers are claimed?The Sumerian accountssay, quoting \"Zu\" (Sin):\"I will take the divine ME,And the decrees of the gods I will direct.I will set my throne and control all the ME.I will direct the totality of the Igigi [\"Those Who Observe\" or \"TheWatchers\"].”102Children of the MatrixAnd later the Tablets report:\"He seizes the ME with his hands,Taking away the sovereignty of Enlil,The power to issue decrees.Zu then flew away,And retired to his mountain stronghold.\"28The ancient nuclear holocaustThe story is told of how the Anunnaki \"god\" Ninurta volunteered to recover theMEstones. Zu created what seems to be a force field to protect himself fromattackand the tablets say: \"While he controlled the ME, no arrow could approachhim.\"Enki, the chief scientist and engineer, creates a new weapon to penetrateZu'sdefences and he is eventually defeated. Other Anunnaki also made attempts tostealthe ME stones as the battle for power and control between them continued,just as itdoes today. Zu (Sin) was put on trial, but the outcome is not known.It is obvious,however, that the origin of the term \"sin\" in the Bible relates todefying the will of I\"God\", the gods. The story of the battle between Zu andNinurta describes the useof high-tech weaponry, and if anyone thinks that wasnot possible thousands ofyears ago, 1 am afraid the evidence suggests otherwise.At Rajasthan in India,radioactive ash covers three square miles not far fromJodhpur. This is an area ofhigh rates of cancer and birth defects and it wascordoned off by the Indiangovernment when radiation readings soaredastonishingly high. An ancient citywas unearthed which, the evidence indicates,was destroyed by an atomic explosionsome 8,000 to 12,000 years ago. It has beenestimated that half a million peoplecould have died in the blast and it was atleast the size of those that devastatedJapan in 1945. Support for these modernfinds can be found in the ancient texts. TheMahabharata epic tells of: \"A singleprojectile charged with all the power of theUniverse...An incandescent column ofsmoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns,rose in all its splendour...it was anunknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, agigantic messenger of death which reducedto ashes an entire race.\" It talks ofcorpses burned so badly they could not beidentified. How their hair and nails fellout, pottery broke \"without cause\", andbirds turned white. Within hours foodstuffswere contaminated. Is that thedescription of a nuclear explosion or what?This and a very long list of other texts, like the Ramayana, describe a horrificwarbetween the Indian peoples and the Atlanteans. They fought in the sky usingtheflying vehicles they call Vimanas while the Atlanteans used their \"Vailixi\".TheIndian accounts even describe a battle between them on the Moon and thissupportsthe claims of people like Arizona Wilder, a mind-controlled slave whoworked forthe higher levels of the Illuminati. She claims that the reptiliansand the blond-haired, blue-eyed, Nordics, fought ancient battles on the Moon andMars, as well asthe Earth. All this happened during the pre-cataclysmicAtlantean/Lemurian\"Golden Age\" and this underpins the stories of how the oncegreat and mightyAtlantis came to an end amid high-tech war and catastrophe. But when theAnunnakireturned after the upheavals, the same mentality returned with themand theevidence shows that there were more nuclear holocausts.Archaeologicaldiscoveries in the Indus Valley show that cities were built therein the periodbetween 3500 and 3000BC (when the Anunnaki-controlled Sumer Empirewas wellestablished) and they were destroyed about 2000BC amid enormousviolence.What's more, skeletons found at these sites record high rates ofradioactivity.Around this same time of 2000BC, Sumer came to an end with an\"evil wind\",which has all the signs of nuclear fall-out. This \"wind\" brought thesudden demiseof Sumer and the neighbouring Akkadians. Texts known aslamentations tell of a\"calamity\" that befell Sumer, one \"unknown to man, onethat had never been seenbefore\". There was an \"evil wind\", a battling storm anda \"scorching heat\". Somekind of cloud shut out the Sun by day and the stars bynight. The texts continue:\"The people, terrified, could hardly breathe;the evil wind clutched them, does not grant them another day...Mouths were drenched with blood, heads wallowed in blood...The face was made pale by the Evil Wind.\"\"It causes cities to be desolated,houses to become desolate;Stalls to become desolate,the sheepfolds to be emptied...Sumer's rivers make it flowwith water that is bitter;its cultivated fields growweeds,its pastures grow withering plants.\"29Even the gods had to evacuate these lands, we are told, and all theSumeriancities were affected in the same way at the same time. Just as thenucleardevastation in the Indus Valley corresponds with the time period of thispoisonous\"evil wind\" in Sumer, so it also corresponds with the timescale thatsaw the violentdemise of the Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah. Many sources point tothese citiesbeing located in what is now the southern end of the Dead Sea inIsrael whereunnatural levels of radioactivity persist to this day. They callthis \"Lot's Sea\" afterthe Biblical character involved in the Sodom and Gomorrahstory and for thousandsof years it has been associated with the symbol of death.The story of Lot's wife saysthat she was turned into a pillar of salt when shelooked back over Sodom andGomorrah at the time of the destruction, but the wordstranslated as \"pillar of salt\"can also be translated as a \"pillar of vapour\".30This not only makes rather moresense than \"salt\", it fits with the emergingpicture here. The accounts of thedevastation of Sodom and Gomorrah describe how\"God\" decided to destroy thesecities and warned his friends to get out. What acoincidence, then, that the Sumeriantablets explain in detail how the Anunnakileadership (God = gods again), led by104Children of the MatrixEnlil and some of his offspring, decided to destroy those locations in yetanotherinternal war, this time with the one known as Marduk, the son of Enid'shalf-brother and great rival Enki. Still today it is the Enlil and Enki factionsof theAnunnaki that most divide the Illuminati and create the ongoing conflict.There is an enormous and unnatural scar in the landscape of the Sinai(Sin-ai)Peninsula, which covers an area of 112 square miles. Blackened stones(blackenedonly on the surface) can be found over a large section of the easternSinai and toconventional history and archaeology, which finds the idea ofancient high-techweapons unthinkable, they remain a \"mystery”.” However, thescenes of theseapparent nuclear explosions are to the west of Sumer and in theSumerianlamentations we are told that the \"evil wind\" that poisoned the waterandatmosphere, and brought that civilisation to an immediate conclusion, wascreatedin a \"flash of lightning\" and \"spawned in the west\". Can the mystery ofSumer'ssudden demise now be solved? Could the \"evil wind\" have been nuclearfall-out?In around 1450BC, the classic Minoan (former Sumerian) culture wasdestroyed onCrete by another sudden disaster that archaeologists and historianscan't explain.Once again all the cities were destroyed at the same time by some\"fiery\" holocaust.Amid this series of immensely violent events and the internal war withintheAnunnaki, the Sumer Empire collapsed. Its domains around the world begantoself-govern, at least for a while, based on the knowledge, structure, beliefs,andmyths of their former controllers. Since then, the reptilian Anunnaki havebeenmanipulating from behind the scenes and through their hybrid bloodlines, andtheyare on the brink of replacing their formerly overt global empire (their OldWorldOrder) with their covert global empire (their New World Order). They arethehidden force behind the introduction of the global centralisation of powerthat isexploding all around us today. The Anunnaki, at least after the finalAtlantiscataclysm, sought to hide their reptilian form by keeping out of publicview asmuch as possible.Now you see them, now you don'tThe reptilian bloodlines covertly operating within human society created manyofthe ancient Mystery schools to hoard the knowledge of true history, and theesotericand technological expertise of Atlantis, Lemuria, and thepost-cataclysmic world,especially the Sumer Empire. They also seized control ofthe other Mystery schools,which were formed with a more enlightened agenda. Thiswas one of the rolesassigned to the Royal Court of the Dragon (also known as TheBrotherhood of theSnake) from around 2000BC when it infiltrated the morepositive Egyptian Mysteryschools and made them vehicles of the reptilian \"gods\".Manly P. Hall, theFreemasonic historian, summarises what happened, although for\"black magiciansof Atlantis\" also read \"reptilians\":\"While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil,therearose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or black magic, [inEgypt]...the black magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman105powers until they had completely undermined and corrupted the morals oftheprimitive Mysteries...they usurped the position formerly occupied by theinitiates,and seized the reigns of spiritual government.\"Thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralysed the intellectualandspiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete andunhesitatingacquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priest craft. ThePharaoh became apuppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council - a committee ofarch-sorcerers elevatedto power by the priesthood.\"32This is exactly what happened in the latter era of Atlantis and whathappenstoday with the puppet politicians placed in \"power\" by those behind thescenes, theIlluminati, who dictate their actions and agenda. Those who will notdo as they aretold are assassinated, brought down by \"scandal\", fall to\"ill-health\", or aresubjected to a media campaign of abuse that persuades thepeople to remove them.In the Sumer Empire you had the reptilian \"gods\" dictatingto their priesthood,who dictated to the administrators of finance and state. Thesame structure remains.The hidden Anunnaki dictate to their \"priesthood\", theinitiates and bloodlines ofthe Illuminati, who dictate to the administration offinance and state. Their agendais to create a global version of that structure -the world government, central bank,army, and currency. The Mystery schoolnetwork of old, with its fiercelycompartmentalised levels of initiation, hasevolved into the global secret societynetwork of today. This is topped or\"capstoned\" by the Illuminati and, at the verypeak, by the openly reptilianAnunnaki. It has had to be done in this covert waybecause there are not thatmany of them compared with the human population andthey would be overwhelmed ifenough people knew what is really going on.Today's secret society network issimply the modern expression of theAtlantean/Lemurian Mystery schools, whichwere taken over by a malevolent forcein the period before the cataclysms. Thosewith a positive and negative agendafought for control of the Mystery schoolsrestored after the deluge. Eventually themalevolent force won that battle andbegan to expand its power covertly across theworld again. With them they carriedtheir own secret language, the language ofsymbols, which their initiates weretaught to read and understand. I call thisnetwork the serpent cult, the serpentbrotherhood, or the Illuminati. Those three arethe same force. Their secretlanguage includes the lighted torch (Illuminated ones);the pyramid andall-seeing eye (apparently used by the serpent Sirians in Atlantis);the lion(the \"Sun\" and symbol of the serpent cult); the snake, fish, and flyingreptile(gargoyle), and other reptilian symbolism; the hard \"K\" sound used innames andwords (Ka, Ki, etc); the red cross or fire cross on the white background(theflag of England); and the trinity, symbolised as the trident and later thefleur-de-lis and other three-pointed forms.The reptilian-Illuminati know that the balanced fusion of male and femaleenergycreate a third and immensely powerful force and this is one reason fortheirobsession with the \"trinity\". New Agers and others talk about the need tobalance106Children of the Matrixmale and female and they are right. But we lose the plot if we don't understandthatthere are different levels of this fusion. You can fuse the negative aspectsof bothenergies to create a malevolent \"third force\" or you can balance thehigherfrequencies of male and female, so creating a positive third force. Theworld aroundus is, in fact, the manifestation of the negative balance andinteraction of theseenergies. We are led to believe this is a male-dominatedworld, but that is only onthe surface. Behind the scenes it is really controlledby the negative expression offemale energy. The extreme male energy is \"outthere\" in front of our eyes in thethree-dimensional world. It is macho men withguns and uniforms, the leaders ofthe major banks, corporations, media empires,and the military. But they are putinto power, the wars created, and the agendaadvanced, by the extreme negativeaspects of the female energy - covert,behind-the-scenes manipulation. If anything,the Illuminati, at the real seat ofpower, are dominated by the female. The negativeextremes of the female energycovertly manipulate events and the negativeextremes of the male energy play themout before our eyes. This is why we think itis a male-dominated world. It looksthat way, but that is not the whole story.Destroying the ancient knowledgeThere have been two main thrusts of the reptilian secret society network sincethoseancient times. First, to pass on advanced knowledge only to their chosenfew andcontrol how much of this information each of these initiates will beallowed toknow (compartmentalisation). And second, to manipulate events in thepublicarena to suck out of circulation all the advanced esoteric knowledge thatsurvivesthere. They achieved this by creating religions and a \"science\" thatenforced a strictlimitation of vision and possibility. These two \"opposames\",religion and science,then labelled the suppressed knowledge either evil orcrazy. Their condemnationsof astrology are only one example of this.The Illuminati, through frontmen like Columbus, Cortes, Cabot, andCook,eventually returned to the former lands of the Sumer/Atlantean/LemurianEmpires. There, in the name of \"Christianity\" (an Illuminati creation), theysystematically destroyed as much of the ancient knowledge as they could. Thiswasachieved mostly by genocide, especially of the holders of the knowledge, liketheshaman. As Credo Mutwa said of the African experience: \"They milked themindsof the shamen and then killed them.\" Find out what they know and then makesurethey can tell no one else. This is the reason why Credo's information aboutthereptilian Chitauri has been out of public circulation for so long. It wasvital for theAnunnaki-Illuminati to destroy or marginalize the cultures of theNativeAmericans, Central and South Americans, black Africans, the Australianaborigines,and the \"Pagan\" religion in general. This is what they did, ofcourse, as evenconventional history records, but it never tells you the realreason why or who wasreally behind it. By replacing these native cultures withimposed Christianity,Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and all the rest, they couldeither crush the trueknowledge with rigid dogma, or imprison it in a gruesomehierarchical structure ofgenetic \"superiority\", as with the Hindu caste system.107Columba(us)The interconnections of the Illuminati web can be seen in the story ofChristopherColumbus. He sailed to the Americas in 1492 knowing basically wherehe wasgoing because his father-in-law was a sea captain close to Prince HenrytheNavigator, the Grand Master of a secret society called the Knights of ChristinPortugal. The Knights of Christ were another name for the Knights Templarwhofled France for Portugal and Scotland after a purge against them in 1307.33Throughthis secret society underground, Columbus had access to the ancient mapsthatcharted the Americas. It is known that he had \"strange maps\" when he set outfor\"India\". Columbus was a secret society initiate and, according to theAmericanFreemasonic historian. Manly P. Hall, he was connected to the samesecret networkin Genoa, Italy, as the man later known as John Cabot.’4 Fiveyears after Columbuslanded in the Americas, Cabot sailed from the Templar portof Bristol, England, to\"discover\" what we now call North America. They could dothis because they hadaccess through the secret societies to the maps drawn bythe Sumerian seafarers andeven further back to Atlantis and Lemuria. Manyancient maps have beendiscovered that confirm beyond question that the world wascharted thousands ofyears ago, but this is suppressed from the accounts ofmainstream \"history\". As Imentioned earlier, Piri Reis, an admiral in theTurkish Ottoman navy, produced amap in 1513 detailing what the land mass lookslike under Antarctica. Modernsurveys have confirmed that the map is extremely,and unexplainably, accurate.But, of course, it is explainable. As he saidhimself, he drew the map from far earlierones he had seen - maps compiled beforeAntarctica was covered in ice. Reis drewhis map just 21 years after Columbus setsail. Columbus, like Cabot and the laterCaptain Cook, had access to the samesource material that Reis did, and more. Allthree were given maps and funding bythe bloodlines and their network. CaptainCook was backed by the FreemasonicRoyal Society in London, for instance, andColumbus was sponsored by KingFerdinand and Queen Isabella of the land wenow call Spain, and the infamousIlluminati bloodline in Venice, the de Medicifamily. They all go backgenetically to the kings of Sumer and beyond to Atlantisand Lemuria. Another keybloodline in the Illuminati to this day is the House ofLorraine (L'Orion?) inLrance. They employed Columbus, too, and there wasanother famous figure ofhistory, who worked for both the House of Lorraine andthe de Medicifamily...Nostradamus. Michel de Notre Dame or \"Michael of OurLady\" hadphenomenal esoteric and healing knowledge for his time because he wasconnectedto the bloodlines that held, and still hold, the ancient knowledge fromSumer,Atlantis and Lemuria in their secret society web while systematicallyremoving itfrom public circulation.So we are looking at an unbroken theme - and scheme - through history of thesamebloodlines and their secret society network controlling events in line withaspecific agenda of global control by the reptilians. They have expanded theirpowerout of the Near and Middle East by sea and land over the centuries. Theybecamethe leaders in royalty, politics and finance, wherever they went. Thencame a keyperiod when they could begin to \"go global\" once again. When Williamof Orange,108Children of the Matrixone of the bloodlines, crossed the English Channel from Holland in 1688, hewasmanipulated on to the throne of England to rule jointly with Queen Mary. Thiswasthe symbolic coming together of the bloodlines that had made their wayintoEurope by land with those that were taken to the British Isles long beforeby theSumer Empire and even those who had survived the Atlantean cataclysmsinBritain. William's invasion came ashore close to the same spot where Brutuslandedaround 1103BC with his Trojans to found his \"New Troy\" or London.Veryconveniently two decades before William's arrival, London had beendevastated byfire, the Great Fire of London in 1666 (666 is anIlluminati-Satanic code) and thisallowed a whole new city to be built by highinitiates of the Illuminati. Theseincluded, most notably, Sir Christopher Wren,who designed St Paul's Cathedral atthe top of Ludgate Hill. St Paul's was builton an ancient site of worship to theGoddess Diana and this where Princess Dianawas married to Prince Charles.(Incidentally, Wren's title of \"Sir\", an honourawarded to this day by the Queen andthe British Government, often for servicesrendered, comes from an ancient reptiliansnake-goddess called Sir and relates toone of the Anunnaki.)The new City of London was built after the fire in the knowledge that it wastobecome a major global centre for the Illuminati bloodlines. So it was afterthe arrivalof William of Orange, who became William III, and to whom all theroyal families ofEurope are related. In 1694, William signed the charter thatcreated the Bank ofEngland and the whole central banking system began to emergewith its mastersdictating policy to all of them via organisations like the Bankof InternationalSettlements in Switzerland. What also followed the creation ofthe Illuminatioperational stronghold in London were the British Empire and theother Europeanempires. As these expanded across the planet to take over theAmericas, Africa,Asia, China, Australia and New Zealand, they exported thebloodlines and secretsocieties and made every effort to destroy the nativeknowledge and culture. Also,within those countries were the hybrid bloodlinescreated by the interbreedingbetween the Anunnaki and selected families in thoseregions long before, and thesewere the people who were left in the positions ofpower after the colonial invadersfrom Europe withdrew and granted the countries\"independence\". Credo Mutwahas identified many of the black leaders in Africasince \"independence\" to be fromthe same former \"royal\" bloodlines of Africa thatclaimed descent from the \"gods\".When these European empires apparently collapsed or withdrew, this onlyhappenedon the surface, not in the fundamentals of control. There are two formsofdictatorship: one that which you can see, the overt tyrannies like Communismandfascism, and the covert dictatorship, which you cannot see because itoperates in thestrictest secrecy. It grows like a hidden cancer, eating into thepositions of power inevery area of society. The obvious, open, forms ofdictatorship have a finite lifebecause eventually there will be a rebellionagainst control you can see, touch, andtaste. There is an identifiable target onwhich to focus. However, covertdictatorship, control from behind the scenes, cango on forever until it is exposedbecause people do not rebel against not beingfree when they think they are. Whenthe British and European empires appeared tounravel, these powers were only109exchanging overt control for covert. While they appeared to give \"independence\"totheir colonies, the bloodlines and their secret society networks remainedintactwithin those countries and they have continued to control them ever since.Butbecause no one knows this and the people see a president or prime minister oftheirown colour or nation, it is assumed that the country is \"free\" andself-governing. 1document in The Biggest Secret how the United States of Americahas never beenfree of control from London to this day and that the federal levelof US governmentis a private corporation controlled from Europe. The Presidentof the United Statesis merely this corporation's temporary chief executive, thesame role as thepresident of the former Virginia Company, which was formed in1604 by the BritishCrown and \"aristocratic\" bloodlines to steal North America inthe first place. Anextraordinary story, but true. At least 50 of the 56signatories to the AmericanDeclaration of Independence were Freemasons and onlyone was known not to be.When the Grand Master Freemason, George Washington, became the firstPresident,he nominated eleven Supreme Court Justices, at least six of which wereconfirmedFreemasons. The same story has continued ever since. The inaugurationofWashington in 1789 was a Freemasonic ceremony in which he swore the oath onaFreemasonic Bible. In January 2001 President George W. Bush took the oathusingthat same Bible, as did his father more than a decade earlier. It is theproperty of theNew York Lodge, according to news reports. Washington, whocommanded theAmerican colonial armies against the British Crown, was a knight ofthe Order ofthe Garter, one of the most elite Illuminati networks headed by theBritish Crown! Itseems to be a staggering contradiction, but when you know thescam it makesperfect sense. (See The Biggest Secret for the detailed backgroundto the AmericanWar of \"Independence\".)There is no better example of the point I am making here than SouthAfrica.During the period of apartheid, it was an open dictatorship by the few ofthe many.As a result there was a clear target and so internal and externalrebellion led to theremoval of that regime. Along came the first blackpresident. Nelson Mandela. He isprobably a nice man, but a powerless puppet intruth, and since then Thabo Mbekihas replaced him. Black people now have a voteand so South Africa is free. Yippee!Oh really? The Illuminati global structurecan be likened to a compartmentalisedPyramid or a spider's web. The operational\"spider\" at the centre is in Europe withLondon, Paris, Brussels, and Berlin thekey cities. From Europe the agenda isdictated down the line to what I call the\"bloodline branch managers\" in thevarious countries of the world. These\"bloodline managers\", like the Rockefellers inthe United States and theBronfmans in Canada, have a network of other bloodlinefamilies around them thatcontrol the politics, finance, business, media, andmilitary, etc., in theirparticular country or domain within the web, much as theAnunnaki \"gods\" weregiven different regions to rule in line with the centrallydictated agenda. Andjust as the gods fought with each other and tried to muscle inon another'spatch, so these Illuminati branch managers do today; hence theinfighting andconflict between them. It is the \"manager's\" job to orchestrate theevents andpolicies of their country to follow the demands of the centrally110Children of the Matrixcontrolled agenda. This is how the same events and policies can beintroducedeverywhere, often at the same time.Now, South Africa is free, yes? The bloodline branch managers of South Africaarethe Oppenheimer family and their network. Under the open dictatorshipofapartheid, they controlled some 80% of the country's stock market, owned thegoldand diamond mines on which the economy depends, and controlled themediathrough their various frontmen. Today, since the election of Mandela andMbeki, thapartheid dictatorship has been replaced by \"freedom\". 1 know this istrue, I heardit on the news. Under this \"freedom\", the Oppenheimer family andits networks,continue to control some 80% of the South African stock market, ownthe diamondand gold mines on which the economy depends, and control the mediathroughtheir frontmen, not least an Irishman friend of Robert Mugabe and HenryKissingercalled Tony O'Reilly. Isn't freedom just wonderful? And this hashappenedeverywhere as the same forces have remained in control since theillusion of\"independence\". But look at the South African experience. Under theovertdictatorship with apartheid there was widespread rebellion inside andoutside thecountry. But now, under covert dictatorship...silence. Everyonethinks South Africais now free and \"independent\".So you see that the \"hidden hand\" method is by far the most effective wayofcontrolling people and dictating events. This exchange of overt for covertcontrolhas happened on every continent and this is how the Anunnaki and theirhybridbloodlines manipulate the world today.SOURCES1 Our Haunted Planet, p 1442 Frans Kamp in conversation with the author3 Quoted in Flying Serpents And Dragons, p 674 Correspondence with the author5 W.

Hall's America's Assignment With Destiny, The Adepts Of TheWesternTradition, published by the Philosophical Research Society. Los Angeles,California, in1979CHAPTER 7Serving the dragon:the pastGreat spirits have always experienced violent opposition from mediocreminds.Albert EinsteinThe ancient world abounds with stories of the serpent or dragon race androyalkings, queens, and emperors who claim their right to rule through theirdescentfrom the serpent gods.The Sumerian accounts tell of flying serpents and dragons breathingfire(symbolic of their aerial craft?) and how the kings of Sumer, going backlong beforethe deluge to some 240.000BC, were \"changelings\" seeded by the unionof the godsand humans. Sargon the Great, that famous ruler of the Sumer Empire,claimed thisgenetic origin and the very existence of \"kingship\" is reported veryclearly to havebeen a gift of these gods. Equally clear is that they werereptilian gods, as in \"Thereptiles verily descend\". And there are manyreferences by the Sumerians to theirgods as fiery, winged, serpents. The termU-SHUM-GAL, often used to describeEnki, translates as flying, fiery, serpent,which would perfectly describe a reptilianin a flying craft emitting a fieryexhaust. In fact the word SHUM can relate to theterm \"sky vehicle\".1There could be another origin for this \"fiery\" symbolism, also. The AnunnakigodNinurta was called a MUSH-SHA-TUR-GAL-GAL - the \"flying serpent withthe fieryglance\" and this fits perfectly with the descriptions by the Zulu shamanCredoMutwa in his stories of the reptilians in ancient and modern African legend.Hesays the reptilians have a third eye between the other two which opens fromsideto side instead of top down - the \"fiery, red eye\" in African tradition. Fromthiscan be flashed a red, laser-like beam, he says, which can knock a persondown andparalyse them. This is an origin of the phrase about giving someone the\"evil eye\".2In China the Lung Wang (\"Dragon Kings\") were said to have a \"magicalpearl\" ontheir foreheads, a \"divine eye\" and mystical source of power. Frenchstories fromthe Alpine regions speak of a dragon with a blood-red ruby \"eye\" inthe centre ofthe forehead that was so bright the creature seemed to beprojecting fire.3Sometimes this middle eye is called a dracontia4 and the eye inthe centre of theforehead in the ancient stories of the beings called theCyclops may well relate tothis, too. Credo Mutwa and modern abductees describehow the most \"royal\" andsenior reptilians, the Draco, have horns. Some look likeDarth Maul in the Star Wars112113Picture #20 [images/img_0020.png]movie with the nodules or\"horns\" around his head.So much truth is told asfictionthrough Hollywoodmovies, both by thosetrying to get the story outand,overwhelmingly, bythose conditioninghumanity for the openappearance of these beingsin the years to come. In myview,George Lucas of StarWars is among the latter.The Sumerians depictedtheir \"gods\" with hornedFigure 16: The Satanic goat's head is. in part, a symbolof the helmets and otherhorned \"Draco\" . , . .headgear that was laterused by the hybrid bloodlines to symbolise royalty and kingship, and fromthiscame the symbol of the royal crown. Look at Darth Maul and you will perhapsseewhere the crown comes from. Credo Mutwa says on the Reptilian Agenda, partone,that he was amazed to see Darth Maul because of his likeness to thereptilians inancient and modern African legend. The ram or goat's head, sowidely used as asymbol of Satanism, is partly symbolic of the horned nature ofthe Anunnaki\"royalty\" that Satanism was created to serve (Figure 16). Ram is aword or syllablemeaning fire and relates to the Atlantean god of fire, Votan.From this we getpentagram, pyramid, Semiramis, Ramses, Rama, Ramtha, maybe evenprogram orprogramme, a word at the heart of the Illuminati strategy.The dragon kingsThe kings of the succession in the reptilian bloodlines were known as\"Dragons\".When many kingdoms joined together in battle, or as a group ofkingdoms, theyappointed a king of kings. These were known as the Great Dragonor...Draco. TheCeltic title of Pendragon, as in Uther Pendragon, the father of\"King Arthur\" in theGrail stories, was a version of this. In the legends, thesymbolic Arthur was adescendant of the dragons and his helmet (or El-met, namedafter a reptiliangoddess called El) carried a dragon motif. The red dragonsymbol of Wales comesfrom the claim by Merlin, Arthur's \"magician\", that the reddragon symbolised thepeople of Britain. Merlin was described as only half humanbecause he was thechild of an underground being and a human woman. The Arthurianstories includeall the classic elements of the story, including the creation ofroyal bloodlinesthrough the interbreeding between humans and non-human entities,shape-shifting,the use of holographic images to hide a being's true form, andbattles betweencompeting dragons. Geoffrey of Monmouth, the 12th centuryhistorian, said thatMerlin's earlier name had been Ambrosius, thus possiblyassociating him with the114Children of the MatrixGreek term for menstrual blood, Ambrosia, which the reptilians love todrink.5There is also the theme of the \"Lady of the Lake\" and this connects withthe storiesof goddess-worshipping serpent peoples like the Nagas living inundergroundcentres located under lakes and lochs. Like the Celtic myth andfolklore, the ancientGreek culture was inspired by the Sumerians and the earlierAtlanteans andLemurians and was based almost entirely on their stories and mythsunder differentnames. All over the ancient world you find the same recurringstories of the serpentgods. Throughout the Sumer Empire the people worshippedserpent gods and asthe Reverend John Bathhurst Deane wrote in his book, TheWorship Of The Serpent:\"...One of [the] five builders of Thebes [in Egypt] was named after theserpent-god ofthe Phoenicians, Ofhion ...The first altar erected to Cyclops atAthens was to 'Ops', theserpent deity...The symbolic worship of the serpent wasso common in Greece thatJustin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it intothe mysteries of all their gods.\"6The Hebrew serpents1 have mentioned that in Hebrew myth, the Biblical \"Nefilim\", the \"sons ofthegods\", are called awwim, which means devastators or serpents. Hebrewlegendsalso describe the Eden serpent as a being who walked and talked like ahuman. TheHebrew book of ancient oral tradition, the Haggadah, speaks of thisserpent as acreature with two legs that stood upright to the \"height of acamel\".7 The SlavonicApocalypse of Abraham says the serpent with Eve had hands,feet and wings,^ justlike many other ancient and modern descriptions of theDraco. The Hebrew storiescame from the earlier Sumerian, Atlantean, and Lemurianaccounts, many of themchanged and twisted to suit the priesthood and to losemost of the direct reptilianreferences. These can be identified, however, byfollowing the trail from which theirterms and names derived. The name of theHebrew winged \"angels\", the Seraphim,means serpent and they were described ashaving six wings - just like the one in theGarden of Eden featured in theApocalypse of Abraham.9 Flying angels in religioustexts are symbolic of thereptilians, some of which, according to ancient and moderndescriptions, havewings and can fly. This is also symbolised in the flying reptiliangargoylefigures, which the bloodlines have on their homes, cathedrals, churches,andother buildings, including the British Houses of Parliament. Seraph in theKingJames Version of the Bible is translated as \"fiery serpent\" and would seemto derivefrom the same root as the Sumerian, seru, the name of a serpent in theEpic ofGilgamesh (the origin of the \"Noah\" story), and sarpa, a Sanskrit termfor theIndian reptilian \"gods\", the Nagas.The Jewish Talmud forbids the depiction of the dragon, as it does the Sun andtheMoon, both symbols of major Anunnaki figures. A fragment of the HebrewDead SeaScrolls, translated by the Hebrew Scholar, Robert Eisenman, includesadescription of a \"Watcher\" known as Belial (an origin of the \"Sun gods\" BelandBaal?). It calls him the \"Prince of Darkness\" and the \"King of Evil\" and heisdescribed as a being of terrible appearance...\"with a visage like a viper\".Theresearcher and channelled W.T. Samsel, writes in The Atlantis Connection thattheforce behind the spiritual demise of Atlantis was known as the Sons ofBelial.Interestingly, one of the key colleges at Oxford University, that\"education\" centrefor the Illuminati, is called Balliol and it has produced manysignificant politicianswho have advanced the Illuminati agenda. It is namedafter its founder John Balliolwho was married to a Scottish Princess,Dervorguilla of Galloway. Their son,another John Balliol, was King of the Scotsfrom 1292 to 1296. The Balliol familywere big time bloodline and given theIlluminati's astonishing obsession withsymbols and the sound of names and words,there may well be some connectionbetween Belial and Balliol. Certainly there isin spirit because Balliol College, likeOxford University in general, is anIlluminati stronghold turning out futuregenerations of placemen and women.Early accounts by the Gnostic sect (Gnostic = \"knowledge\") tell of theserpentgods in a positive light. They claim that Lilith (Eve) was their firstcreation and thenAdam followed as her partner. The Hebrew Talmud also claimsthat Lilith, avampire, was Adam's first wife. This is symbolism, of course, butsymbolisingwhat? Lilith (also Lillibet and Elizabeth) is one of the code namesfor the bloodlineson the female side to this day. She was known as Lil to theSumerians and Lilitu inBabylon. Hebrew traditions say that Lilith rebelledagainst Adam and his God andfled to a cave after eating her own child. There shelived with the demons of theunderground world and bred with them. She told Adamand Eve that she and heroffspring would always abduct human children and takethem to theirsubterranean world. The Roman Church savagely suppressed theGnostics, notleast because they did not believe that people needed a middlemanbetweenthemselves and God. Went down very well with the Christian priests, thatone.Hippolytus, an early Christian \"father” and historian, wrote that many ofthe firstGnostics in North Africa were known as the Naaseni or \"Serpents\" andtheyworshipped Nahustan, the golden or brazen serpent, the image of whomtheydisplayed on wooden crosses. The Naaseni (Nagas) later became known astheOphites, a Greek term for serpent. The Greeks said that serpents werecreatures ofgreat knowledge, which spoke through their oracles - psychicchannellers. In otherwords, communications from another dimension, or density.The story of Mosescontains much serpent symbolism, also.The garden of Eden, Edin, HedenThe serpent that \"tempted” Eve in the Biblical Garden of Eden is thebest-knownserpent symbolism of all. This was an edited rewrite of the far moreancientSumerian story of Edin, the \"Land of the Gods or the Righteous Ones\".There isagain a common theme of the serpent gods in a garden, and JamesChurchwardsuggests in The Children Of Mu that these \"gardens\" all refer toLemuria-Mu, the\"Motherland\". I think he could well be correct. The Persiansspoke of a region ofbliss and delight called Heden, which was more beautifulthan the entire world. Itwas the abode of the first men before an evil spirit inthe form of a serpent temptedthem to take the fruit of a forbidden tree. Thereis also the banyan tree under which116Children of the Matrixthe Hindu \"Jesus\", known as Krishna, sat upon a coiled serpent andbestowedspiritual knowledge on humanity. The ancient Greeks had a tradition ofthe Islandsof the Blessed and the Garden of the Hesperides in which grew thegolden apples ofimmortality. The garden was defended by a dragon. In Chinesesacred books thereis a garden that contained trees bearing the fruit ofimmortality. It, too, was guardedby a winged serpent called a dragon. Theancient people of Mexico had theirversion of the Eve story that involves a greatmale serpent, and a Hindu legend tellsof the sacred mountain of Meru, guarded bya dreadful dragon. This was said of somany ancient places. The belief in aserpent or half-reptile, half-human, givingknowledge to humanity is also auniversal story.Asian serpentsPicture #21 [images/img_0021.png]The Indus Valley culture of the Sumer Empire and the Lemurians, and theHindureligion and Indian mythology that emerged there, are full of references totheserpent gods and flying dragons who brought knowledge and fought witheachother in the sky. They called them the Nagas, as we have seen, and they saidtheycould take either reptilian orhuman form whenever theychose.10 The Nagas,whooriginated in Lemuria, seededthe \"royal\" families, we aretold, and interbredwith thewhite peoples. It was said thatthe Indian serpent-goddessKadru gavebirth to all theNagas or \"cobra people\" andmade them immortal byfeeding them herlunar(menstrual) blood. The themeof the serpent goddess orserpent queen iseverywhere,as we shall see in detail later,and in Figure 17 you can seethesymbolism of \"serpentmaidens\" in Indian art. TheIndian epic, the Ramayana,tellsthe story of the serpent-god called Ravan who went toCeylon. Ravan was said tofeed on humans and drink the blood of his enemies.11Ceylon was a major centrefor the serpent race, it seems. Ancient Chinese sourcessay it was a home of theNagas, the \"strange reptilian-like creatures\", as theydescribed them.12 They arereported to have traded with the Chinese, butinterestingly it is said that theynever revealed themselves. They left their productsand a price tag, but stayedout of sight until the Chinese traders had departed.\" TheFigure 17: Maidensportayed in Indian artof the serpent cult symbolically117Nagas were reported to have a \"special weapon\" that paralysed their enemiesanddrained their life force. Abductees have reported the same experience inmoderntimes. Snake worship continues in India today, of course.Serpents of the far eastThe entire culture of China is based on the dragon and serpent race. Onceagain,here was a highly developed civilisation thousands of years ago that wasinspiredby Lemurians and later influenced by the Sumer Empire. Even todaytheirlanguages and writing are remarkably similar, as are their myths andstories. Thegreat age of Chinese culture is reckoned to have begun around 2800BC- when theSumer Empire was in full swing. Chinese history says that the firsthumans werecreated by an ancient goddess called Nu Kua, who was half dragon andhalfhuman. The Yih King, a very ancient Chinese book, says that the dragonsandhumans once lived in peace and that they intermarried and interbred.14AncientChinese emperors were described as \"dragon-faced\" and looking like thedragongods. Japanese emperors claim descent from these same \"gods\" and theirancientlegends say those islands were populated by beings that came from the skyAgainJames Churchward connects the Japanese race to Lemuria-Mu. There arecountlessJapanese legends about serpents and dragons, and their marriages andsexualencounters with humans that produced reptilian-human offspring.Shape-shiftingserpent people would change into beautiful men and women, and lurehumanwarriors and leaders into sexual encounters. Michael Mott, author ofCaverns,Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures, tells of one story involving amaiden calledMimoto who was seduced by a member of the serpent race:\"...Mimoto never saw her dragon-lover again but she did give birth to a hybridchild,whom she called Akagire Taro, or Chapped Son. This was due to the factthat his skinwas cracked, creased, and scaled like that of a reptile. From herethe ancient taleenters historic accounts, for a direct descendant of AkagireYataro, as the son wasknown in manhood, was a member of the Genji Clan namedSaburo Ogata, who tookpride in the fact that he had scales on his body as hadhis ancestors before him. Hewas the grandson of Yataro the Fifth. Again, aprominent family line seems to havebeen the desired target of the original, andperhaps repeated, genetic exchange. Whilein the East, the influx of'dragon-blood' is seen as a thing of great pride, in the Westsuch things arecovered with an elaborate coating of fable and mist, becoming 'fairytales' aboutserpent or frog-princes. Western sentiment, at least on the surface, isagainstsuch liaisons, often for religious reasons but not always on this basis alone,asthe subterraneans have a track-record of cruelty, selfishness, and malice.\"15The Chinese calendar zodiac, dating to 2500BC, is symbolised by animals, allofwhich still exist, except for one - the dragon. Is it really likely that theywouldchoose real, living, creatures for all their signs, except for just one?Again we see thetheme of reptilian bloodlines in China. The ancient Chinesebelieved that a dragonfathered the First Dynasty of \"divine\" emperors, andsubsequently emperors118Children of the Matrixclaimed their right to rule because they were descended from the serpentgods.Their thrones, boats, and beds were designed with dragon symbolism. Todaythereare many Chinese bloodlines in the Illuminati, particularly some strands ofthe Libloodline, as identified by author and researcher, Fritz Springmeier, inhis book,Bloodlines Of The Illuminati (Ambassador House, Colorado, USA, 1999).16Just as thisbook was heading for the printers in March 2001, Springmeier and hiswife wereraided by the US agencies involved in the mass murder at Waco and theirresearchwas confiscated. James Churchward, who did so much extensive researchinto theexistence of Mu, claimed that the ancient tablets he examined from anIndianmonastery revealed that the serpent hybrids, the Nagas, had populatedChina,Tibet, and a significant part of Asia, including the Uigher Empire.17 ThePamirMountains or \"the roof of the world\" in central Asia is one specificlocationconnected by legends to the peoples of Lemuria-Mu and there you willfind theLake of the Nagas or Lake of the Serpents.18 Among the descendants ofthesebloodlines, it is claimed, were the fair-skinned Aryans, again indicatingtheconnection between the reptilians and the Nordics. As a \"serpent\" colony,youwould expect to find pyramids in China, and you do. One was some 1,000 feethigh- twice the height of the Great Pyramid at Giza. This was encircled byothers andsome still survive today, including what is left of that monsterstructure. Referencesto them have been found in Chinese texts dating back 5,000years.The secret society initiate Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff said that he hadbeenpart of an unsuccessful expedition to find a lost city of the Uigher Empireunder thesands of the Gobi Desert. He said he was initiated into the Sun/MoonBrotherhoodof Central Asia and was told that the founders of this Brotherhoodhad come fromMars in ancient times.19 James Churchward says that the UigherEmpire wereformer Lemurians. Later a Russian archaeologist called ProfessorKosloff found atomb of ancient artefacts in the same area of the Gobi Desert.These included apainting of a ruler and his queen and he estimated the work tobe some 18,000 yearsold - at least.20 There was also an emblem of a circle witha cross, and at the centrewas a symbol similar to the Greek letter, Mu. Anexpedition by the AmericanMuseum of Natural History in 1993 found a mysteriouslylarge number of dinosaurfossils in the Gobi Desert. They found 40 to 50 dinosaurskeletons in around threehours in an area no bigger than a baseball field.21Researcher and author MarkAmaru Pinkham writes in The Return Of The Serpents OfWisdom that a race ofextraterrestrials called the Kumaras established a Mysteryschool on Lemuria/Muand later relocated their operation to Mongolia, the GobiDesert region of China,and to Tibet.22 Certainly Tibet is one of the mostimportant depositories of theancient knowledge, and legends galore talk ofunderground cities and tunnelsystems where the \"supermen\" continue to live.Agartha and Shamballa are themost famous of them. The Chinese invasion andoccupation of Tibet is far moreconnected to this story than politicalacquisition. Tibet, that land of such ancientsecrets and legend and still todayvery much connected with the Illuminati, isanother home of the serpent symbol.So is the ancient, former Lemurian, culture ofthe Australian aborigines thatincludes the Rainbow Serpent.The Chinese name for the ley lines or meridian lines of the Earth energy gridisdragon lines. Appropriate and understandable given that the reptilians exploittheenergy in this grid, and built temples and structures at the major vortexpoints. Anancient Chinese tale about the dragon kings also makes a clearreference to shape-shifting. This is the most amazing aspect of this bizarrestory - the way thesereptilians can change their appearance or \"shape-shift\"between a human andreptilian form, evidence for which I will present shortly. Acharacter called Liu Ye,who wanted to marry a princess of the \"dragon race\", wassaid to have seen thepalace of the emperor change before his eyes and thecourtiers dissolve and thenreturn to their original form. He saw the coils ofdragon bodies, flashing wings, anddragon's eyes. The legend says that Liu Yechanged his Earth form and became oneof the dragon race that lived in the sky.With that, he became immortal.23Serpents of the AmericasThe story is the same in the Americas with the serpent gods at the heart oftheancient myths and legends of North, South and Central America. The books oftheMayans called Chilam Balaam say the first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexicowerethe Chanes or \"People of the Serpent\".24 They were said to have come acrossthe sealed by a god-figure called Itzamna, a name that apparently comes from theworditzem, which translates as lizard or reptile.25 Itzamna, the sacred city ofthe god,therefore, means \"the place of the lizard\" or \"Iguana House\".26Itzamna's symbolwas the Tau cross also known as the T-square in Lreemasonry.Quetzalcoatl, themost famous Central American \"serpent\" god, also carried a Taucross. This cross,like the Christian cross, refers to crossbreeding inIlluminati symbolism and notpolarity union as is often claimed. While excavatingin Central America near a placecalled Texcoco, the archaeologist William Nivendiscovered more than 20,000 tabletsthat included many symbols identical to thosefound on the Naacal tablets, whichJames Churchward had seen in India.27 AndChurchward's tablets were connectedto Lemuria/Mu, which was the origin of boththese cultures. Itzamna was theCentral American version of the creator god whobreathed life into \"Man\" and yetanother who was depicted as half human, halfreptile. Quetzalcoatl, the \"LeatheredSerpent\", was the major deity of thisculture and he travelled, like all the others, in a\"flying boat\". It is possiblethat Quetzalcoatl is another name for the AnunnakiDNA wizard, Enki. Aztec mythsays that Quetzalcoatl created humans with helpfrom the Serpent Woman,Cihuacoatl - Ninharsag of the Anunnaki worked withEnki, according to theSumerian tablets.There is serpent symbolism all over the ancient Central American sacred sitesandthese were places of human sacrifice on a scale that beggars belief.EdwardThompson, the American archaeologist, was initiated into the MayanBrotherhoodof Sh'Tol and he was told that the name of the ancient port city ofTamoanchan inVeracruz, Mexico, means \"the place where the People of the Serpentlanded\".28 Theycame in boats, he was told, which \"shone like the scales ofserpent skins\" and theywere \"clad in strange garments and wore about theirforeheads emblems likeentwined serpents\".29' Another landing point for the\"serpent\" Atlanteans was Valum120Children of the MatrixVotan. Here, according to Spanish chroniclers, Pacal Votan and his entouragecameashore. Pacal Votan means \"He of the Serpent Lineage\".30 He established thecity ofPalenque, the heart of the Mayan culture in the Yucatan. Palenque is thecentre of itsgeographic land mass, as is the Great Pyramid at Giza.31 The templeor pyramid of theSun at Teotiuacan in Mexico uses the royal cubit as its unit ofmeasurement, the sameas the Great Pyramid, and its mathematics conform to thoseused in ancient structuresacross the world.32 Why? Because they all originatefrom Lemurian/Atlanteanbloodlines and know-how. The Olmec peoples of CentralAmerica based their wholeculture on worship of the serpent. Excavations haveuncovered representations of theOlmecs with serpent features, snake heads, andbodies like dragons.Native American culture in general is awash with reptilian imagery andincludesmany tales of the \"Sky Gods\" coming down to breed with their women. InOhiothere is a mysterious and unexplained mound shaped like a serpent from aculturelong forgotten. The Hopi Indians in Arizona have their plumed serpentgodBaholinkinga. They talk of an underground world they call Sipapuni, wheretheyclaim to have originated. They say that while they were within the Earththey werefed by the \"ant people\" and they refer to their ancestors as their\"snake brothers\".These descriptions sound very much like beings described inSumerian accounts.The most sacred of Hopi underground rituals is the snakedance. This is very muchlike the dance rituals performed by Mayans at placeslike Chichen Itza in theYucatan, Mexico. The Hopis believe they share the sameancestors as the serpent-worshipping Chimu people of Peru - Lemurians. The Chimuestablished a citycalled Chan-Chan or \"Serpent-Serpent\".33 Their \"Temple of theDragon\" stillsurvives and their priests would make snake hissing sounds andchant \"snakemantras\" to invoke their serpent gods.34 Significantly, the regionwhere you find theHopi and Navajo lands in Arizona/Utah, is also claimed bymodern UFOresearchers and abductees to be the site of a major undergroundreptilian base. Thisis especially true of Four Corners, where the states ofArizona, Utah, Colorado, andNew Mexico all meet at the same point. The HopiSnake Clan, an ancient society ofinitiates, claims its origins from a Hopi boywho was taken into the \"House ofSnakes\" in a tunnel complex under the Earth.33Another Hopi legend speaks of avery ancient underground tunnel complex under LosAngeles, which was occupiedby a \"lizard race\" some 5,000 years ago. In 1933, anLA mining engineer called G.Warren Shufelt claimed to have found this complex,but the news of the discoverywas immediately covered up. Today it is claimed bysome people that highlymalevolent Freemasonic rituals are held there. Geronimo,the great chief of theApache, told legends of the dragon and the serpent peoplewho ate children. Hesaid his tribe was named after a boy called Apache whokilled the great dragon. Thestory has the feel of David defeating Goliath andeven George defeating theDragon. Mark Amaru Pinkham in The Return Of TheSerpents Of Wisdom, interpretsthe explosion of serpent symbolism as recognitionof energy and spiritual initiates. 1agree with some of that, but there wererather more literal reasons for thesesymbols, I would suggest. Anyway, he does agood job in detailing the symbolismof the serpent around the world, includingthat in America or \"Amaraka\":\"According to the descendants of the early Lemurian record keepers, theAndeanElders, the entire American land mass was anciently known as Amaraka, the'Land ofthe Immortals' or the 'Land of the Wise Serpents'. The title Amaraka isderived fromthe Quechuan-Lemurian word Amaru, meaning snake or serpent.(Quechuan, thelanguage of the Incas, is derived from Runa Sima, the primaltongue spoken onLemuria, and ends in the syllable \"ka\", which denotes bothserpent and wisdom).Apparently echoing the recollections of the Andean Elders,H.P. Blavatsky maintainsin The Secret Doctrine that America is referred to inthe Hindu Puranas (legends) asPotala, the Kingdom of the Nagas [Serpents].\"36Native Americans call America \"Turtle Island\" after their reptilianancestors.The name of the founder of both the Inca Empires in South America wasManco orManko Kapac (Kapac means serpent wisdom or spiritually wealthy). Some oftheformer Lemurian and Atlantean peoples who settled in the Andesmigratednorthwards to become some of the Native American tribes of what we nowcall theUnited States. The Mescalero Apaches of Arizona claim to descend, viaPeru, froma continent that sank in the Atlantic.37 This was documented byLucille TaylorHansen in her book, The Ancient Atlantic (Amherst Press, Amherst,Wisconsin,1969).38 Asa Delugio, the Mescalero Apache Chief, told her that theancestors of theApaches were \"serpents\" from their sunken homeland in theAtlantic, which hecalled Pan and the Old Red Land. After being forced byconflict to leave Peru theytravelled north where they fought with localtribespeople in North America. Theirmen were killed and the women went on tobreed with the victors to form thebloodlines that became the Mescalero Apaches.Hansen identified significantconnections between the Apaches and the peoples ofNorth Africa who alsoclaimed descent from Atlantis. The Mescalero Apache CrownDance is performedwith serpents painted all over the bodies of the participants.The chief wears a 13-pointed crown of the Atlantean fire god, Votan, and otherkey performers wear thetrident headdress. The trident is the symbol of Atlantisand Lemuria. Hansenestablished that the Tuareg people in North Africa, who claimto originate inAtlantis, perform an identical dance. She also saw an ancientEgyptian artefact thatappeared to depict the very same dance. The Sioux tribeinsist that their ancestorswere from Atlantis via Peru, and again the serpent orreptilian imagery isextremely prominent in the story. Sioux means \"snakes\", asanother tribe, theIroquois, means \"serpents\".39 The Sioux ancient records saythat after the demise ofAtlantis, their ancestors, who they call the Turtles,travelled to the CaribbeanIslands (from Ka-rib, the Atlantean serpent people)40and went on to SouthAmerica before heading north. They say these \"Turtle\" peoplebecame known asthe Lakota and the Sioux or \"snakes\". This story is apparentlysymbolised at themysterious Serpent Mound in Ohio in which the Turtle isdepicted leading thesnake. The original structure was vast, covering 14 acresand rising to 100 feet. TheLakota, Sioux and Peruvian native peoples sharecertain words in their language.A Sioux chief called Shooting Star said during avisit to Peru:122Children of the Matrix\"This is the land of our beginning, where we went from the Old Red Land evenbeforeit sank, because this land is as old as the Dragon Land of the firegod.\"41Which was, of course, Atlantis. Other Native American tribes (many with thehard\"k\" sound in their names) say they descend from Atlanteans or Lemurians whofleddirectly to North America from the sunken lands. Oklahoma, asignificantIlluminati centre in the United States, means \"Sun people of the RedLand\".42 LucilleTaylor Hansen collected Native America legends, which say thatsome tribes camefrom Atlantis under the leadership of the prince grandson ofVotan 111, who wasalleged to be the last priest king of the Atlantean House ofVotan. Hansen says thatthis grandson of the royal bloodline of Atlantis wrote abook called Proof That I Am ASerpent, which survived in circulation among theNative Americans until the time ofthe European invasion when it disappeared.Prince Votan's arrival in North Americawas celebrated with an annual ceremonyknown as Thanksgiving, later stolen by theEuropean Pilgrims and still a majorfestival in the United States.43 A key area forIlluminati rituals and mindcontrol projects is Mount Shasta in northern Californiaand this is also at thecentre of many legends about \"serpents\" and Lemurianssettling before and afterthe cataclysm. As with all of these former Atlantean andLemurian peoples, theywere obsessed with building structures on the vortex points.Some 40,000 stonecircles, pyramids, and mounds were built in North America.44Burning flames wereoften placed on the top of the mounds and they were neverallowed to beextinguished. These were the symbol of the \"Great Spirit\" or \"SerpentFire\", acontinuation of the worship of the \"Fire Serpent\" of Atlantis.45 The mostusedsymbol of the Illuminati today is the flame or lighted torch. It is known asthe\"eternal flame\" - exactly the term used by the ancients. The Native Americantribesformed secret societies or \"Serpent Clans\" like the Snake Clan and theThunderbirdClans. The Thunderbird is a version of the Chinese rain dragon. Manyof theirleading initiates were believed to be snakes in human form, which,symbolically, iswhat the key bloodlines are. Author Mark Amaru Pinkham writes ofthese clans:\"They were reputed to wield the lethal power of a live snake and display boththeintimidating temperament and appearance of the unsavoury beasts. As a sign oftheirviperous power, Snake initiates would often adorn their body withsnakeskins orsnake tattoos and hang snake fangs from around their necks. Theyalso conveyedpoisonous snake venom within the medicine bag and/or armedthemselves with aserpent-embellished rattle, which would hiss eerily like acoiled snake when shaken.The tendency of such snake initiates was to besecretive, like a stealthy reptile,and some even developed a penchant forseeking out dark secluded dwellings orliving nocturnally.\"46Initiations into these clans include being covered, often bitten, by livesnakes.Sometimes the rites involved cutting off a finger or other part of thebody andfeeding it to a snake (don't say a thing!). My eyes have just watered.The main deityof these Snake Clans is the \"Great Horned Serpent\".123African serpentsCredo Mutwa, the official historian of the Zulu nation, has painted picturesfromancient and modern descriptions of these reptilian entities (see picturesection) anddescribes the various levels of the fiercely imposed genetichierarchy. The lowerlevels are the \"warriors\", the \"poor bloody infantry\" as wesay in Britain. They areruled by the \"Royal\" leaders, which have horns andtails, and at the very top arebeings with a white, albino-like, skin and not thegreenish or brownish colour of theothers. Witnesses and abductees have reportedseeing reptilian beings with albino-like skin and these descriptions can also befound in ancient texts. In Africa thereptilians are known as the Chitauri or\"Children of the Serpent\" and \"Children ofthe Python\". This is so close to theCentral American term \"People of the Serpent\".Africa is another continent awashwith the legend of the serpent race. ForAnunnaki, Annetoti, Nagas, Dravidians,and so on, read Chitauri. Differentnames, same people.Credo Mutwa talks for hours on the video The Reptilian Agenda, part one,aboutthe background and history of the Chitauri, and he confirms the theme ofshape-shifting and how the Chitauri bloodlines can take either human orreptilian form.He describes how the Earth was once encircled by a canopy ofwater vapour (the\"firmament\") that was destroyed in a cataclysm. This watervapour protected theplanet from the harsh effects of the Sun, and the wholeplanet was moist and humidand had a constant temperature. It was a place ofenormous abundance and vastforests. This is a common description of the GoldenAge - the Lemurian \"Garden ofEden\". But, he says, that when the Chitauridestroyed this canopy (symbolised bythe Biblical 40 days and 40 nights of rain)the whole climate changed as the Sun'srays baked once green and abundant landslike Egypt and began to form thedeserts. Scientists agree that Egypt, now partof the Sahara Desert, was once a greenand pleasant land. This could explain thewater erosion found on the Sphinx. Todivide and rule the people, Credocontinues, the Chitauri scattered them across theEarth and gave them differentlanguages so they could not communicate with eachother. This is another storyrepeated all over the world and not just in the OldTestament version of theTower of Babel. That was a steal from many more ancientaccounts. The Hopi saythat when they came to the surface on the orders of \"SpiderWoman\", a \"mockingbird\" arrived to confuse their language and make the tribestalk in differenttongues. Credo, repeating the information passed on to him in alifetime ofinitiations into this underground knowledge, said that the Chitaurireptiliansinterbred with all races to create the reptilian-mammalian hybridsthrough whichthey rule. He said that in African culture a person's genealogy isvery importantand that the \"royal\" bloodlines of the kings of black Africa claimeddescent fromthe same \"gods\" as the white peoples and others across the world.What's more, hesaid that these black royal bloodlines, like those in the countries ofthe whitepeoples, had largely moved out of the positions of inherited control, likekingsand queens, where they could be identified. Instead they have taken thepositionsof \"appointed\" or \"elected\" control, like government administrators,bankers,businessmen, and political leaders. He reveals, from his knowledge of124Children of the Matrixblack African genealogy, that the black presidents who came to powerafter\"independence\" from the white Europeans have been the same royal bloodlinesasthe kings and queens of black Africa. He cited Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe asanexample - the same Robert Mugabe who was manipulated into power bytheIlluminati's Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington, as documented in ...AndTheTruth Shall Set You Free. Mugabe has brought poverty, hunger, and chaos toblackand white alike in a country that should be one of the richest in Africa.At the sametime, he has made himself a billionaire by \"winning\" rigged electionsand stealingthe people's wealth. Also in Africa, as we have seen, the AfricanDogon tribe ofMali, it is claimed, say they were visited by extraterrestrialsfrom Sirius. The Dogonappear to descend from a Greek people who themselvesclaimed descent from the\"Argonauts\". The Dogon settled first in Libya and thenfurther south in Mali, wherethey interbred with the Negro peoples.The Greys are reptilianCredo also supports the view of many UFO researchers that the so-called greys,thatbest-known of extraterrestrial beings, are lackeys for the reptilians. Buthe goesfurther than that. He says they are reptilian. The control and focus ofthe world isbased on Europe and North America and for far too long that has beenthe case inUFO research, too. This has blinded so many of those researchers tothe staggeringinformation available in the vast continents of Africa, SouthAmerica and nativeAustralia. While they are still arguing over whether \"greyaliens\" were found inRoswell, New Mexico, in 1947, black African tribes peoplehave been finding thesegreys in the bush for hundreds of years right up to thepresent day. Black Africanscall them the Mantindane (\"The Tormentors\"). Credosays that often when the greysdie in the open, they are removed quickly bygovernment agencies or their\"friends\" in flying craft. But occasionally deadgreys have been found and removedby tribes people and he has witnessed thembeing taken apart and examined. Hedescribes in the video, The Reptilian Agenda,part one, how he was once given part ofa grey to eat, without realising what itwas, and the consequences were amazing inthe effect on his mind and body, goodand not so good. 1 won't spoil the story incase you want to see the videobecause he tells it so brilliantly He says that thegreys are not grey and do nothave big black eyes, as it appears. The grey \"skin\", hereveals, is actually astrange type of suit, which is astonishingly difficult to breakthrough. InCredo's words, it requires not just a new axe, but one that has beensharpened toits fullest potential. When you finally breach the \"suit\", he says, youfindinside a pinkish, scaly, reptilian, creature with pupils that go up-down likeareptile's. Africans call them in this \"non-suited\" state, \"Pinky, Pinky\". Thebig blackeyes, he says, are not eyes, but very sophisticated goggles to protectthe eyes of thegrey from the Sun. For some reason, the reptilian greys and atleast some of theother reptilians cannot endure, or do not wish to experience,direct sunlight, andthey have to either wear these suits and eye protectors oronly go out at night. Iknow it's serious, but I have to laugh at how bizarre itall is. Aliens walking aroundin grey suits wearing big black shades, and othersdoing impressions of the MarioBrothers or Puff the Magic Dragon. Wake me up. Researcher Alan Walton alsosaysthat the greys have been described as having a \"reptiloid, amphiboid, orevensaurian\" genetic base complete with scaly skin, and webbed claw-likefingers. Hesays that people have reported seeing reptilian eyes with verticallyslit pupilswithin the \"big black slanted eyes\" that seem in many cases to be\"some type ofbiomechanical covering\". He says that they also appear to have aninsectoid-typeinfusion into their DNA. Frans Kamp came across this same theme ofan aversion tosunlight in his own research of the reptilians:\"Reptilians are intuitive or paranormal creatures. They live underground becauseofthe Sun. The radiation of the Sun diminishes the production of seratonin andasseratonin is necessary for the stimulating of the pituitary gland or pinealgland toproduce melotonin, they better stay underground. Melotonin isindispensable for life.The more melotonin, the more life. The moreintuition/paranormal you are the higherproduction of melotonin.\"47Draco = DraculaThis is where part of the symbolism in the story of Dracula originates. It waswrittenby the Irish author Bram Stoker and published in 1897. Stoker probablyknew thescore after years of research into the countless vampire legends. As aHistoryChannel documentary about Stoker confirmed, there is no part of the worldand noera of history that does not have its myths and legends about vampires whofeed offother people's energy and blood. Look at the main elements of that talein the light ofwhat you have read so far. His name is Dracula (the Dracoconstellation is thealleged home of the royal reptilian bloodlines). He iscalled \"Count\" Dracula(symbolic of the way these Draco bloodlines have beencarried by \"human\" royaltyand aristocracy). Dracula is a vampire (symbolic ofthe need of the Draco reptiliansto drink human blood and feed off human energy).Dracula shape-shifts, appearsand disappears (symbolic of the reptilianshape-shifters and 1 will elaborate on thisshortly). He cannot stand directsunlight (exactly what Credo and others say of thereptilians and greys). Hecomes in through \"windows\" (symbolic of theinterdimensional portals throughwhich reptilian entities enter our world). So manyfamous writers and artistswere initiates or dogged researchers who told elements ofthe story through artand \"fiction\". Stoker's character was largely based on a mancalled Dracula orVlad the Impaler, the 15th-century ruler of a country calledWallachia, not farfrom the Black Sea in what is now Romania (Rom = reptilianbloodlines). This wasthe same region that was once called Transylvania, the home ofthe most famousvampire legends, and the Danube River valley, which runs fromGermany to Romaniaand into the Black Sea, is a name that comes up very often inthe history of thebloodlines. Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula, slaughtered tens ofthousands of peopleand impaled many of them on stakes. He would sit down to eatamid this forest ofdead bodies, dipping his bread in their blood. He was a great guyto invite homefor dinner, apparently. He usually had a horse attached to each of the126Children of the Matrixvictim's legs and a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The endofthe stake was usually oiled and care was taken that the stake not be toosharp; hedidn't want the victim dying too quickly from shock. Infants were oftenimpaled onthe stake forced through their mothers' chests. The records indicatethat victims weresometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake.Death byimpalement was slow and painful. Victims sometimes endured for hours ordays.Dracula had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns and themostcommon was a ring of concentric circles. The height of the spear indicatedthe rankof the victim, an excellent indication of the ritual-obsessed reptilianmind. Thedecaying corpses were often left there for months. It was once reportedthat aninvading Turkish army turned back in fright when it encountered thousandsofrotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danube. In 1461 Mohammed II,theconqueror of Constantinople, a man not noted for his squeamishness, wassickenedby the sight of twenty thousand impaled corpses rotting outside ofDracula's capitalof Tirgoviste. The warrior sultan turned over command of thecampaign againstDracula to subordinates and returned to Constantinople. Tenthousand wereimpaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, where Dracula had oncelived. On St.Bartholomew's Day, 1459, Dracula had thirty thousand merchants andothersimpaled in the Transylvanian city of Brasov. One of the most famouswoodcuts of theperiod shows Dracula feasting amongst a forest of stakes andtheir grisly burdensoutside Brasov while a nearby executioner cuts apart othervictims. Impalement wasDracula's favourite technique, but by no means his onlymethod of inflictingunimaginable horror. The list of tortures employed by thisdeeply sick man includednails in heads, cutting off limbs, blinding,strangulation, burning, cutting off nosesand ears, mutilation of sexual organs(especially in the case of women), scalping,skinning, exposure to the elementsor wild animals, and boiling alive. No one wasimmune to Dracula's attentions.His victims included women and children, peasantsand great lords, ambassadorsfrom foreign powers and merchants.Vlad the Impaler was the son of Vlad Dracul, who was initiated into theancientOrder of the Dragon by the Holy Roman emperor in 1431. Its emblem was adragon,wings extended, hanging on a cross. Vlad II wore this emblem and hiscoinage borethe dragon symbol. All the members of the order had a dragon ontheir coat of armsand he was nicknamed Dracul (the Devil or the Dragon). SonVlad signed his nameDraculea or Draculya or the \"Devil's son\" and this laterbecame Dracula, a name thattranslates as something like \"son of him who had theOrder of the Dragon\". Mostappropriate. This is the same Dragon Order that istoday promoted by the British\"Holy Grail\" author, Sir Laurence Gardner. By theway. Queen Mary or Mary of Teck,the mother of King George VI and thereforegrandmother to the present Elizabeth II,was descended from a sister of\"Dracula\". Nothing like keeping it in the family.British and European serpentsIn Britain and the rest of Europe, the stories of dragons and reptilian godsaboundalso. Here are just some of the places in the British Isles that havedragon/serpentlegends: Avebury, Bamburgh, Baslow, Betws-y-Coed, Bishop Auckland,Brent127Pelham, Bretforton, Brinsop, Bromfield, Bures, Burley, Castle Neroche,Cawthorne,Chipping Norton, Crowcombe, Dartford, Deerhurst, Dinas Emrys,Dronley,Dunstanburgh, Durham, Gunnerton, Henham, Highclere, Horsham,Hughenden,Hutton Rudby, Kellington, Ker Moor, Kilve, Kingston, Lewannick,Linton, LlandeiloGraban, Llyn Cynwch, London, Longwitton, Ludham, Lyminster,Middlewich,Mordiford, Norton Litzwarren, Norwich, Nunnington, Oxford,Penmynydd,Penshaw, Renwick, Saffron Walden, Saint Leonards Lorest, ShervageWood,Slingsby, Sockburn, Tanfield, Trull, Uffington, Wells, Westbury,Wharncliffe,Wherwell, Wiveliscombe, Wormbridge, Wormingford, Wormhill, andWormshill.(Worm or wirm means \"wingless dragon\".) All the legends of the dragonsandserpents of the British Isles follow similar themes.48The British Isles was an Atlantean/Lemurian colony before the deluge andthebloodlines returned there as the Phoenicians, Egyptians, and other names,when theSumer Empire began to expand to the centres of its former Motherlands.Thecarriers of the Atlantean/Lemurian knowledge in Britain and other parts ofEuropewere called the Naddred or Adders, a Welsh name for serpent.49 They arebetterknown as the Druids, a Gaelic word in Ireland meaning a wise man,sorcerer, orserpent, and they were called the \"snake priests\". An Irishmanuscript claims thatthe adepts of the Druidic arts descended from the Tuatha de Danaan - \"The Peopleof the Serpent Goddess Dana\".50 Apparently the Tuatha de Danaan were alsocalledthe Sumaire. These were the former Atlantean peoples who settled in AsiaMinor(Turkey) and then expanded out into Europe. It was they who called Britain\"Albion\" after Albina, the eldest daughter of Danaus, an ancient Danaanpriest.51Danaan is also so close to Canaan, of course, and these \"two\" peoplescame fromthe same part of the world. I think we will find that Danaan and Canaanare termsfor the same people. It was one of their number, called Brutus, who ledmigratingDanaans/Trojans to the British Isles and established the city of CaerTroia or \"NewTroy\" - today's London. The legend goes that when the Danaans weredefeated bythe later Greek Milesians of Asia Minor, the peace agreement involvedthe Danaansmoving from the surface to live in an underground kingdom which couldbeaccessed from \"hollow hills\" in Ireland.52 The Danaans were said to be a giantraceof warriors, who became smaller through generations of living within theEarth.The same was said in Ireland of the Firbolgs, Formorians, and Nemedians,whowere also defeated and driven underground where, it is said, they lost theirgiantstature. This theme of giants forced underground where they dwindled inheightcan be found all over the world and, like the Danaans, they are often describedashaving what I call the \"Nordic\" appearance. Another common story is that thesePeople abducted surface humans and interbred with them. Michael Mott in hishook. Caverns, Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures, also points out the closesimilarityof \"Tuatha\" and \"Tuat\", the Egyptian name for the underworld, throughwhich thePharaohs believed they would travel to immortality.The Druids, it is said, continued to use their Danaan knowledge on thesurfaceafter those peoples were forced underground. The highest level of theDruidicPyramid was the Arch Druid. They were located on islands because land128Children of the Matrixsurrounded by water is a particularly powerful energy centre and if it alsohappensto host major vortex points on the energy grid that power is increasedimmensely.The Arch Druids were based on the Isle of Man (home of an ancientDanaanMystery School) in the Irish Sea, the Isle of Anglesey off the North Walescoast, andthe Isle of Wight, the \"Dragon Isle” as it was called, off the southcoast of Englandwhere I have lived for nearly 20 years.53 Researcher Mark AmaruPinkham suggeststhat the Isle of Wight could have been (therefore is) the\"pivotal vortex\" in thenorthern grid of the planet. No wonder so much Satanisminvolving majorIlluminati figures goes on there. Stonehenge, Avebury,Glastonbury Tor, Bath, andIona were other significant Druid centres. GlastonburyTor (hill or mound) waslocated in the Isle of Avalon and Avalon means \"island ofthe Immortals\" - a namethat is common to many of these \"serpent\" centres. Theisland of Iona off theScottish coast was formerly known as Innis nan Druidhneahor \"Island of theDruids\". The Arch Druids were indicated by the seven \"serpenteggs\" displayed ontheir breasts.54 The goddess Artemis (Dana, Diana) was alsodepicted with eggs onher chest. Was the legend of the mythical St Patrickchasing the snakes out ofIreland the destruction of the Druid or Adder network?If this was so, it happenedfor public consumption only as the knowledge wastaken out of general circulation,but remained very much alive within the secretsocieties.Egyptian serpentsYou find the same story of serpent symbolism in the country to which somanymodern Illuminati symbols and codes relate: Egypt. The great Temple of AmmonorAmen Ra was placed on a massive vortex point at Thebes or Karnac (Amen orAmmonis where the Christians get their term Amen!). Under Thebes/Karnac arenetworksof tunnels known as the \"Serpent's Catacombs\". As a result of thetravellingEgyptians of the Sumer Empire (or the Nordics who travelled to theSumer region)we also have Carnac in Brittany (Barati), France. There were once10,000 standingstones here, arranged to form the image of a seven-mile serpent.Carnac means\"Serpent Hill\".55 The ancient Egyptian accounts known as thePyramid Texts speakof the serpent being both subterranean and celestial. Stories offlying serpentscan be found in Egypt, as you would expect of an important colonyof the SumerEmpire, and, once again, they symbolised immortality. Flying serpentswerepictured taking the kings to the land of immortality in a star constellationinthe heavens. One serpent symbol was the divine asp on the headgear ofEgyptiankings and they used the fat of the crocodile in their coronations. Thegreat ancientEgyptian city of Alexandria was called \"City of the Serpent's Son\"(Alexander theGreat) and there they worshipped the serpent god, Serapis. He wasknown as the\"Sacred Serpent\" or \"Fire Serpent\" and from this comes the Biblical\"Seraphim\", theserpents associated with YHVH or Yahweh (Jehovah). The Temple ofSerapeum in IAlexandria was dubbed one of the seven wonders of the ancientworld, as was the400-foot-high Pharos lighthouse in the city, which was toppedby the Illuminati'skey symbol the lighted torch or eternal flame. In the temple,Serapis was portrayedas a massive statue standing on a crocodile holding a staffwith a serpent coiling129around it. At the top of the staff were the heads of a lion, dog, and wolf, allclassicsymbols of the serpent cult.56 Egyptian queens like Cleopatra were knownas the\"Serpent of the Nile\" and the Uraeus hieroglyphic sign for goddess was aserpent.57Later Gnostic Christians adopted the name Uraeus as a secret name forGod!58 ManyGnostic traditions also identified the serpent with \"Jesus\".59As with many other cultures of the serpent gods, they were seen in theearliestEgyptian records as either benevolent or partly benevolent and partlynot so. This iswhat you would expect from any race of people that reflects allattitudes. However,there came a time, which can be identified most clearly inEgypt, when this imagechanged dramatically. Suddenly, they were the bad guys. Inthe earlier Old andMiddle Kingdoms (which ended about 1640BC), the serpent wasgiven a good press.But starting with the New Kingdom it was all very different.Especially from the 18thdynasty (starting about 1546BC), serpents become thetarget of hatred and rituals wereperformed to exorcise them. This change ofserpentine image in Egypt came in theperiod of chaos lasting hundreds of years,after the Middle Kingdom fell.60 And it wasthe kings of the 18th dynasty whoremoved the Hyksos, who invaded Egypt andruled till around 1550BC. The Hyksos(which means \"Princes of Foreign Lands\")destroyed all places of worship of theold religion when they took over, and R.A.Boulay writes in his Flying SerpentsAnd Dragons that the Hyksos were known as theAmalekites by the Hebrews and werepart of the Rephaim, descendants of thereptilian Nefilim.61' Apop was the firstruler of the Hyksos in Egypt and the name wasused to symbolise the serpent whenthey took on their \"evil\" public image in Egypt.The serpent was known as Apep orApop (Apophis to the Greeks), and Apop becamethe symbol of the serpent peoplewho occupied Palestine and also Egypt at the timeof the so-called \"Exodus\".Rituals to destroy Apop in Egypt were very similar tothose in Asia designed toovercome the Nagas. For me the Hyksos were of thereptilian bloodline and playeda major role in infiltrating the Egyptian Mysteryschools. It was around 2000BCthat the Royal Dragon Court, now the Imperial RoyalDragon Court and Order, wasformed in Egypt by the priests of Mendes to protect,advance, and serve the\"dragon bloodlines\" and 4,000 years later it is still in operationand promotedby Sir Laurence Gardner in England. This is the organisation, remember,thatawarded the Dracula family its most prestigious title.Clearly the legends and accounts of the serpent gods, their royal hybrids,andtheir often grotesque activities, abound throughout the ancient world. Sodoes themost bizarre theme of all - their ability to change their form beforeyour eyes. Theycan shape-shift.130Children of the MatrixSOURCES1 Translations of Zecharia Sitchin2 The Reptilian Agenda, part one, with Credo Mutwa and David Icke3 Flying Serpents And Dragons, p 314 Ibid5 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 6506 Reverend John Bathhurst Deane, The Worship Of The Serpent (J.G. and F.Rivington,London, 1833)7 Flying Serpents And Dragons, p 78 Ibid, p 99 Ibid, p 1010 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 90311 Ibid, p 4112 Ibid13 Ibid14 Ibid, p 4815 Caverns, Cauldrons, And Concealed Creatures16 Fritz Springmeier, The Illuminati Bloodlines (Ambassador Flouse, Westminster,Colorado,1999), pp 163 to 18517 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 5018 Ibid, pp 53 and 5419 Ibid, p 5120 Ibid21 http://www.amnh.org/Research/Gobi/gobi.html22 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 5223 Flying Serpents And Dragons, pp 48 to 5024 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 6725 Ibid, pp 66 and 6726 Ibid27 Ibid, pp 68 and 6928 Ibid, p 6529 Ibid30 Ibid, p 6631 Ibid, p 8732 Ibid33 Ibid, pi5534 Ibid, pi54Serving the dragon: the past13135 Ibid, pi 8036 Ibid, p 5537 Ibid, pp 60 and 6138 Ibid39 Ibid, p 6340 Ibid, pp 62 and 6341 Lucille Taylor Hansen, The Ancient Atlantic (Amherst Press, Amherst,Wisconsin, 1969)42 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 6343 Ibid, p 6444 Ibid, p 8445 Ibid46 Ibid, pi 7847 Correspondence with the author48 For more on British dragon legends and a host of other ancient and modernreptilianinformation, see the award-winning Reptilian Agenda archivesatwww.reptilianagenda.com part of the David Icke website.49 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 24450 Ibid51 Ibid52 Ibid, p 24553 Ibid, p 25154 Ibid, pp 250 and 25155 Ibid, p 8056 Ibid, p 26057 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, pp 906 and 1,02858 Ibid, pi,02859 Ibid, p 90760 Flying Serpents And Dragons, p 4361 IbidCHAPTER 8the shape-shiftersWhoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge isshipwreckedby the laughter of the gods.Albert EinsteinThe accounts of the reptilian control of humanity are not confined to theancientworld, as we shall see very clearly as the story is revealed. CathyO'Brien, avictim of the Illuminati's vast mind control programme, wrote of herreptilianexperiences in her book, Trance-Formation Of America (RealityMarketing, Las Vegas,1995). I have told Cathy's story at length in my previousbooks and I will elaborateon the mind control programmes later in this one.Understandably, Cathy believedher reptilian experiences with leading figures inthe United States to be part of hermind control. However, as you will see withthe evidence I shall present, what shesaw and heard was not quite the illusionshe thought it to be. She described howmany leading US politicians she workedfor in her mind-controlled state appearedto take a reptilian form before hereyes and then return to \"human\". These includedPresident George Bush, father ofPresident George \"Dubya\", of theAnunnaki/Merovingian bloodline. Father Georgetold her they were anextraterrestrial race that had taken over the world, but noone realised it becausethey looked human. Cathy relates another importantexperience she had withMiguel de la Madrid, the President of Mexico duringBush's tenure at the WhiteHouse. She writes in Trance-Formation Of America:\"De La Madrid had relayed the 'legend of the Iguana' to me, explaining thatlizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. The Mayan pyramids, theiradvancedastronomical technology, including sacrifice of virgins, was supposedlyinspired bythe lizard aliens. He told me that when the aliens interbred with theMayans toproduce a form of life they could inhabit, they fluctuated between ahuman andIguana appearance through chameleon-like abilities - 'a perfect vehiclefortransforming into world leaders.’ De la Madrid claimed to haveMayan/alienancestry in his blood, whereby he transformed 'back into an Iguana atwill.1De la Madrid produced a hologram similar to the one Bush did inhis...initiation.His hologram of lizard-like tongue and eyes produced theillusion that he wastransforming into an Iguana.\"1132Remember that the Mayans say the first settlers of the Yucatan in Mexico weretheChanes or \"People of the Serpent\". They were led by the god Itzamna, a namethatapparently comes from the word itzem, which translates as lizard or reptile.Thesacred city of Itzamna, therefore, means \"the place of the lizard\" or \"IguanaHouse\".What Cathy O'Brien reports there is an excellent summary of what hashappened,except for the part about holograms and illusions. What she saw was nota reptilianhologram, but what is known as \"shape-shifting\". If anything it isthe \"human\" formof these people that is a holographic \"cover\". Shape-shifting isthe ability to changephysical form, in this case between a human and reptilianappearance. The ancientDanaan brotherhood of initiates and magicians calledTelchines on the island ofRhodes could shape-shift into any form, according tothe Greek historian, Diodorus.2Shape-shifting is a common theme in tales ofesoteric \"magicians\" and high initiates.1 have been told by hundreds of peopleall over the world, from every walk of lifeyou can imagine, about theirexperiences of seeing well known and less well knownpeople transform into areptilian form before their eyes and then go back again.George Bush (FatherGeorge) is the name that recurs most often in these accounts.There have beenreports of shape-shifting reptilians for thousands of years. In theIndus Valleyand Hindu culture their serpent gods called the Nagas were oneexample.Interestingly, James Churchward established that the Maya of CentralAmerica andthe Nagas of Asia were the same former Lemurian peoples. You can seein thevideos, The Reptilian Agenda, the information and confirmation that theZulushaman Credo Mutwa presents of the shape-shifting reptilians.3 The serpent\"sea\" or\"fish\" gods of Sumer and Babylon were said to be able to change shapeand lookhuman whenever they chose. Another version of shape-shifting are theso-called\"Men in Black\" who appear and disappear according to witnesses. Thestory of Jekyland Hyde is also symbolic of shape-shifting.The children of the shadowsAncient tablets, alleged to come from beneath a Mayan temple in Mexico,describethe reptilians and their ability to shape-shift. These accountscorrelate remarkablyWith modern experience and reports. They are known as theEmerald Tablets ofThoth, who was a deity of the Egyptians. It is claimed thatthey date back 36,000years and were written by Thoth, an \"Atlantean Priest-King\"who, it is said,founded a colony in Egypt. His tablets, the story goes, weretaken to South Americaby Egyptian \"pyramid priests\" and eventually placed undera Mayan temple to theSun God in the Yucatan, Mexico. The translator of thesetablets, who calls himself\"Doreal\" (Maurice Doreal), claims to have recoveredthem and completed thetranslations in 1925. But only much later was he given\"permission\" for part ofthem to be published, he says. You can read the wholetale and the content of thetablets on this website:http://crystalinks.com/emerald.html. There is also a book.The Emerald Tablets OfThoth-The-Atlantean (Source Books, Nashville, Tennessee).However, you don't haveto accept all the details of that story to appreciate thesynchronicity betweenwhat these tablets say and what is now being uncovered.The following is therelevant section in the tablets to the subjects we are discussing.134Children of the Matrix\"Speak I of ancient Atlantis, speak of the days of the Kingdom of Shadows, speakofthe coming of the children of shadows. Out of the great deep were they calledby thewisdom of earth-man, called for the purpose of gaining great power.\"Far in the past before Atlantis existed, men there were who delved intodarkness,using dark magic, calling up beings from the great deep below us. Forthcame theyinto this cycle, formless were they, of another vibration, existingunseen by thechildren of earth-men. Only through blood could they form being,only through mancould they live in the world.\"In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the placewhencethey came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces andplanesunknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times theyappeared amongmen. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwellamong men.\"In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as aremen.Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as menamongmen. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.Slaying bytheir arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and rulingo'er man. Only bymagic could they be discovered, only by sound could their facesbe seen. Sought theyfrom the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and rule in hisplace.\"But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veil from theface ofthe serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they to man andtaught himthe secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift then theylifted the veilfrom the serpent and cast him forth from place among men.\"Yet, beware, the serpent still liveth in a place that is open, at times, to theworld.Unseen they walk among thee in places where the rites have been said;again astime passes onward, shall they take the semblance of men.\"Called, may they be, by the master who knows the white or the black, but onlythewhite master may control and bind them while in the flesh.\"Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only themaster ofbrightness shall conquer the shadow of fear.\"Know ye, O my brother, that fear is an obstacle great; be master of all inthebrightness, the shadow will soon disappear. Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, thevoiceof LIGHT is clear, seek the valley of shadow and light only will appear.\"Within that passage, whatever its origin may be, you have the story of lifeonEarth over hundreds of thousands of years and the source of those who controltheworld today. The leading politicians, banking and business leaders, mediaowners.135and heads of the military are the Anunnaki-serpents in human form. Staggering Iknow, and the minds of most people will be screaming \"nonsense\" because it issoat odds with their conditioned view of reality. But it's true. And if you baleoutnow, you will miss the mass of evidence I will present to show that it'strue.The background presented in those tablets is confirmed by modern experienceand rapidlyemerging information from the inside of the Illuminati. Some examplesfollow:\"Forth came they into this cycle, formless were they, of anothervibration, existingunseen by the children of earth-men.\"As my research has revealed, the world is controlled by entities takingreptilianand other forms that exist on another dimension or \"cycle\". We are in the thirddimension or density, they operate from the fourth, a frequency just outside thepresent range of the physical senses. We can feel the fourth density as \"vibes\"around us, but we cannot see it, unless we tune in with our \"psychic\" sight,whichcan connect our consciousness with other vibrational levels. This is whatpsychicsor \"channellers\" are seeking to do and the good ones (the few) can move theirinner\"radio dial\" to access other frequencies. The \"headquarters\" of the serpent raceI amexposing here is the lower end of the fourth-dimensional frequency range,whichvibrates very close to this one. It is on the very fringe of our physicalsenses. It iswhat you might call a parallel universe or a parallel Earth, amirror of the one wesee, but vibrating at a different speed. Cats can see thefourth dimension and this iswhy they react to something in what appears, to us,to be \"empty\" space. The samewith babies before their psyche is closed down byan ignorant world. To operateand manipulate our vibrational level of the planet,these fourth-dimensionalreptilians needed a third-dimensional human form. They needed to create ageneticspace suit that they could occupy and hide within.This, as President de la Madrid told Cathy O'Brien, was achieved bycreatingbloodlines that fused their reptilian DNA with that of humans. Thesebloodlineshave a genetic, therefore vibrational, compatibility between thefourth-dimensionalreptilians and their third-dimensional \"human\" forms. In other words itmakestheir possession of these bodies far easier and more effective than withother humangenetic streams that do not have that particular DNA combination. Itis to retainthis genetic structure that the Illuminati bloodlines have alwaysinterbred with eachother and continue to do so. It means that if they canmanipulate these bloodlinesinto the positions of power, they are, in effect, putting themselves intothosepositions through their control of these bodies from the lower fourthdimension.This is the reason that the genealogy of those in the major seats ofglobal powertoday can be traced back to the royal lines - the Anunnaki hybrids -that ruledSumer, Egypt, and so on. The ancient Book of Enoch, which covers theperiodbefore the final Atlantis cataclysm, says those born of Nefilim blood are,because oftheir \"ancestral spirit\" (reptilian possession from the lower fourthdimension),destined to \"afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destructionon the136Children of the MatrixEarth\". The Nefilim are fundamentally associated with human sacrifice andblooddrinking - just like the Illuminati today. The Book of Enoch describes thebehaviourof the Nefilim offspring produced with human women:\"And they became pregnant, and bore great giants...who consumed alltheacquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giantsturnedagainst them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds andbeasts,and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh and drinkblood. The Earthlaid accusation against the lawless ones.\"As then, so now.The blood drinkers\"Only through blood could they form being, only through man could they live inthe world.\"Insiders have told me that the reptilians need to drink human (mammalian)bloodto maintain human form and stop their reptilian DNA codes from manifestingtheirtrue reptilian state. Accounts of the Nefilim also include references totheir blood-drinking activities, as we have seen. All this explains why thesebloodlines havealways taken part in human sacrifice and blood drinking ritualsfrom the ancientworld to the present day, a fact I detail in The Biggest Secret.This includes people ofthe bloodline like George Bush, A1 Gore, Bill Clinton,Henry Kissinger, theRockefellers, Rothschilds, British prime ministers like TedHeath, and the Britishroyal family. Yes, including, indeed especially, the Queenand Queen Mother. I havebeen writing for years about the ancient Satanic ritualsperformed by the elite of theUnited States at a place called Bohemian Grove.This is 2,700 acres of secluded andguarded redwood forest in northernCalifornia. Many people just laughed as usual,but, as I was starting this book,Alex Jones, an American journalist, documentarymaker, and radio presenter,managed to get into the Grove during their ritualdisguised in one of the hoodedrobes the participants wear. He took video footageto prove that what I, and manyothers, have been saying about Bohemian Grove istrue. His website iswww.infowars.com.Among the participants at Bohemian Grove past and present are George Bush;GeorgeW. Bush; A1 Gore; Ronald Reagan; Richard Nixon; Jimmy Carter; GeraldFord; DwightD. Eisenhower; Lyndon Johnson; Herbert Hoover; Teddy Roosevelt;Dan Quayle;Robert Kennedy (JFK's brother); Joseph Kennedy (JFK's father); EarlWarren (headof the Warren Commission, which \"investigated\" JFK's murder);David Rockefeller;Laurance Rockefeller; Nelson Rockefeller; Henry Kissinger;Mikhail Gorbachev (theSoviet Union and the \"West\" were always controlled by thesame force); William F.Buckley, an American publisher and major Illuminatioperative; George Shultz, theformer Secretary of State to Ronald Reagan; WalterCronkite, America's mostfamous news reader; William Randolph Hearst, the137American newspaper tycoon; Andrew Knight, a British media executivecloselyconnected to the Rupert Murdoch empire; Edward Teller (\"Father of the Hbomb\");Glenn Seaborg, who developed plutonium; Burt Bacharach, the composer;singerBing Crosby; Bob Hope, a British MI6 operative; Ray Kroc, the man behindtheMcDonald's fast-food empire; author Mark Twain; and John Muir, founder oftheIlluminati environmental front, the Sierra Club.4 That's just a few of themand theirconnection is their reptilian bloodline or their allegiance to theIlluminati. TheKennedys are a major bloodline family in the States, but no oneis expendable if theIlluminati agenda requires action to be taken. Manyrecovering mind-controlledslaves have told me how they were brutally sexuallyabused by Senator EdwardKennedy and one former mind-controlled operative withthe Illuminati, a mindcontroller herself, told me: \"Senator [Edward] Kennedy andthe whole Kennedyfamily was part of this. I know that they are political iconsin our country, but theyare in it up to their eyeballs.\" Phillip Eugene deRothschild says he is one ofhundreds of thousands of unofficial Rothschildoffspring. He stresses that often themost significant operatives in theIlluminati hide behind apparently \"ordinary\"lives while dictating the agenda andattending human sacrifice rituals. This is myown information, too, after talkingto Illuminati insiders. But he says that there aremany public figures who arevery high in the Illuminati-Satanic pyramid and hehighlights Prince Philip as amajor player in the rituals he has attended:\"I can recall the Rockefellers and the Bushes attending rituals, but neverhaving thesupremacy to lead them. I still regard them as lackeys and not realbrokers of occultpower. Except for Alan Greenspan [head of the US FederalReserve Bank], most ofthese fellows were camp followers in the occult, primarilyfor the economic power andprestige. Greenspan, I recall, was a person oftremendous spiritual, occult power andcould make the Bushes and the youngerRockefellers cower with just a glance. Ex-CIADirector Casey (as were most of theCIA leadership for the past forty years),Kissinger, and Warren Christopher[former US Secretary of State] were in attendanceat non-ritual gatherings andsome occult rituals as well, but well back in the gallery.\"At the forefront of the rituals were [the royal families of Europe], PrincePhilip at thepinnacle. He stands, like most of the contemporary Europeanmonarchy, in theCharlemagne, Merovingian, Aenean bloodline. But he is itscurrent head. I am certainthat his maternal chromosomes are in the current\"antichrist\" Nephilim. PrincePhilip...is the leading biological descendent ofthe \"reptilians\", as you call them.Immediately below him are the males of myfamily line [Rothschilds] like a court ofministers in charge of logistics andoperations. The current monarchs of TheNetherlands, Spain, and some of the oldAustrian nobility [Habsburgs] are next inoccult power and in the conspiracy.\"5There is a lot of background to Prince Philip and the Windsors in TheBiggestSecret. Other information has come from the victims of the Illuminatimind controlprogrammes, like the one based at Montauk Point on Long Island, NewYork, which138Children of the Matrixhas been the subject of a number of publications. Mind-controlled slaves arewidelyused by the reptilians and their bloodlines to advance their agenda, as 1haveexposed at length in other books. They have created a global army ofprogrammedpeople to do their bidding, conduct their rituals, and do whateverthey are toldwithout question or thought. Some have recovered at least part oftheir minds,escaped from the projects, and accessed the memories of whathappened to them.They have become increasingly vocal in the last ten years,although the mainstreammedia refuses to report their stories. One mind-controlvictim told me how hewitnessed human sacrifice ceremonies at Montauk involvingWilliam F. Buckley, thewell known American publisher and Bohemian Grove member,who heads the eliteJanus mind control operation based at NATO headquarters inBelgium. ArizonaWilder says she has had similar experiences with Buckley. TheMontauk mind-slaveclaims that the knowledge he learned in these projects showedhim how thereptilians shape-shift. He said there are locked sequences and opensequences ofDNA. Open codes manifest as a physical characteristic while closedcodes do not.The reptilian hybrids, he says, have the ability to lock offcertain genetic codingswhile they open others. When this happens, he says, thereis a literal transformationof the cellular structure, which changes from amammalian to a reptilian form. \"Soit's not like the human form goes anywhere\",he told me, \"It just shifts, it changesinto a reptilian form because thosesequences are opened. They also have the abilityto shift it back.\" However muchyour mind may be struggling to cope with that, forsure what he says about DNAcodes in general is correct. Did you realise that thereare still people todaywho are born with tails? Yes, there are, and it is simplybecause codes from ourreptilian past have opened in those people which, at thistime in the evolutionof the body, should have remained closed and dormant. Asthe human foetus formsinto a baby it goes through many stages that connect withmajor evolutionarypoints in the development of the present physical form. Theseinclude those thatconnect with non-primate mammals, reptiles, and fish. At onestage, the embryohas gills and is very much like those of birds, sheep, and pigsuntil the eighthweek when it goes on its own evolutionary path. When a codeopens that shouldnot, babies are born with tails and these are known today ascaudal appendages.Doctors usually remove them immediately, but in those areasof the world wherethat treatment is not available people live their whole life with atail. Youonly have to feel the bottom of your spine to see where our tails used to beandthey do not manifest today, except rarely, purely because the DNAgeneticblueprint has closed that formerly open code. This mind control victim ismerelyclaiming that when you know what you are doing and understand DNA to amuchgreater level than human scientists currently do, you can make thisprocesshappen in an instant.He says that the reptilians need mammalian hormonal levels to hold themammalcodes open and maintain human form because their \"base-line\" state isreptilianand the mammalian codes would close if they did not consume frequentsupplies ofhuman blood. They also want an adrenaline that enters the bloodstreamin largequantities at times of extreme terror. Hence they have victims who know139they are going to be sacrificed and they use the ritual to build their terror tothepoint of death. This allows them to drink blood full of that adrenaline.ArizonaWilder supplies precisely the same information from her own horrificexperience.She says she conducted sacrificial rituals for the American elite andthe British royalfamily at places like Balmoral Castle in Scotland, as revealedin The Biggest Secretand the video, Revelations of a Mother Goddess. Arizonaadds that the blood type thereptilians most desire is that of blond-haired,blue-eyed, people because it is themost effective for the purpose of holdinghuman form. She, like almost every \"elite\"mind-controlled slave I haveencountered, is blond-haired and blue- eyed. She dyedher hair after escapingfrom her mental and physical slavery Blond- haired, blue-eyed people are alsothe ones most often chosen to be sacrificed by the Illuminati.Red-haired peopleseem very important to them also and they most of all want theblood ofpre-pubescent children and young women who have not had sex. This is todo withthe purity of the blood and energy of children, and the changes that takeplacewithin the energy field once a person has experienced sex or puberty. Thusthe Illuminati sacrifice children and young women more than anyone and this istheorigin of the stories throughout history of sacrificing \"young virgins\" tothe gods.Scientists have discovered aspects of shape-shifting phenomena. Polymer gels,for instance, are remarkable, shape-shifting materials. When exposed tosmallalterations in acidity or temperature they can dramatically transformtheirappearance and size. The different acidities and temperatures are simplydifferentvibrational states. The changing vibration is the key. The forcesbetween moleculesin the gels are delicately balanced in a constant tug-of-warand sometimes one statewins and sometimes another, depending on the outsidestimulus. Hiroaki Misawaand colleagues at the University of Tokushima, Japan,focused a laser beam at thecenter of a cylinder of polymer gel and found thatwithin an instant, the rod'smiddle shrank in diameter, turning it into a dumb-bell. When they shut the laseroff, the middle snapped back to its original width. The transformation of thegelsare entirely reversible, the same as human-reptilian shape-shifting.\"Arizona says she saw members of the British royal family, the Windsors,shape-shift into reptiles many times. Princess Diana's close confidant ChristineFitzgerald,told me that the Windsors wanted to interbreed with Diana's genes(blond-haired,blue-eyed) because they were in danger of becoming too reptilianin their DNA andwould not have been able to maintain a human form for many moregenerations.You can see how different Prince William looks to the rest of thembecause he hadan infusion of his mother's Nordic-dominated DNA. ChristineFitzgerald said thatDiana's private name for the Windsors was \"the reptiles\" and\"the lizards\" and sheused to say in all seriousness \"They're not human.\"7 It wasthe reptilian bloodlinesand their networks that killed the princess in a ritualmurder on an ancient site ofritual to the goddess Diana originally created bythe reptilian Merovingians. Thisdesperation for blood could well account for themystery of cattle mutilationsaround the world in which the animal is bled dryand reports of the bloodsuckingChupacabra in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Florida, andthe Pacific north-west also fit thereptilian description. Many of these reportsand \"outbreaks\" of bloodsucking140Children of the Matrixactivity have coincided with UFO sightings in the same area. Anotherexplanationfor the descriptions of \"humans\" turning into reptilians is that theviewer's psychetunes into the fourth-dimensional level and sees the reptilianform hiding withinthe three-dimensional body, or the fourth-dimensionalreptilian lowers itsvibrational state to briefly enter our physical frequencyrange. I will go into thisaspect of the story in a later chapter. Feeding offhuman blood is not the only desireof these vampires. The reptilians also feedoff human emotional energy. The moreemotion we can be manipulated to projectthrough fear and all its manifestationsthe more energy they can absorb andrecycle against us. Researcher Alan Walton,who writes under the name Branton,has uncovered the same themes:\"Aside from any territorial 'paternal' instinct on the part of the 'Draconians'to re-conquer their \"home planet\" (Earth), some of the worst reptiliansub-species have aneven more sinister motive. These are the vampirial types, whoactually seek to feedoff of human emotional energies and life force/essence inorder to acquire theenergy that they apparently need not only to infiltrate ourworld but also ourdimension. Having genetically engineered themselves along more'warrior instinct'lines, what little connection they might have had to a'spiritual' side has been all buteliminated, and they are motivated only by thepredatory instinct of their collectivewhich apparently knows only one agenda:conquer, assimilate, consume! All this hasbeen confirmed by many abductees,especially in more recent years.\"8The silent invasionBack to the Emerald Tablets:\"In the form of man moved they amongst us, but only to sight, were they as aremen.Serpent-headed when the glamour was lifted, but appearing to man as menamongmen. Crept they into the councils, taking form that were like unto men.Slaying bytheir arts the chiefs of the kingdoms, taking their form and rulingo'er man. Only bymagic could they be discovered, only by sound could their facesbe seen. Sought theyfrom the kingdom of shadows, to destroy man and rule in hisplace.\"That is a wonderful summary of what has happened and is still happening. AsinAtlantis, so still today. The Illuminati (Anunnaki) manipulate theirbloodlines intopositions of power - \"the councils\" - and take over those bodiesfor themselves. It iswhat we call possession. The rituals conducted by theIlluminati-controlled secretsocieties, like the Freemasons, Knights of Malta,Knights Templar, etc., are one waythis is done. The top Illuminati bloodlinesknow who they are, but many of thoselower down do not. These people, whounknowingly occupy a bloodline body, areinvited into the secret society web andtaken through \"initiation\" rituals that thevast majority of them do not begin tounderstand. These rituals, especially the moreadvanced ones, are designed tocreate a vibrational environment in which thefourth-dimensional reptilians canpossess the body. As the initiate progresses141through the levels, he undergoes ever more powerful rituals directed by theblackarts, which, step by step, give the fourth-dimensional entity more powerover theperson's thought and emotional processes until the reptilian is incomplete control.In other words \"Slaying by their arts the chiefs of thekingdoms, taking their formand ruling o'er man.\" These are the people who becomethe presidents, primeministers, banking and business tycoons, media owners, andothers who run oradminister the Anunnaki agenda, although the most powerfullyreptilian are thosewho dictate from behind the scenes: \"Sought they from theKingdom of Shadows[lower fourth dimension], to destroy man, and rule in hisplace\". Exactly.Snake and sound\"Only by magic could they be discovered, only by sound could their facesbeseen...But, know ye, the Masters were mighty in magic, able to lift the veilfrom theface of the serpent, able to send him back to his place. Came they toman and taughthim the secret, the Word that only a man can pronounce; swift thenthey lifted theveil from the serpent and cast him forth from place among men.\"1 have learned from a number of sources that the key to lifting this \"veil fromtheface of the serpent\" is a sound frequency that disrobes the illusion of humanform toreveal their reptilian nature. It resonates a vibration that preventsthem fromholding their \"human\" codes open. This same theme can be found in themovie,They Live, the creation of director, John Carpenter. If you follow hismovie-makingcareer it is obvious that this guy knows the score. They Live,9which I thoroughlyrecommend to get a visual feel for what 1 am saying, is aboutan extraterrestrial racethat takes over the planet while hiding in human form.They control in exactly thesame way as the Illuminati, through secret societiesand mind conditioning. In theend, the heroes of the movie reveal the scam whenthey break the vibrational soundfrequency that is maintaining the illusion thatthose in power are human.Immediately that vibration is destroyed, the presidentand others in power andinfluence shift into their true form and the people cansee who is really ruling them.They Live is available through the Bookendssection of my website. When we findthe right sound frequency the same willhappen among those in power today. Whenit does, can I be wherever the Windsorsare, please?\"Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for evil will surely appear, for only themaster ofbrightness shall conquer the shadow of fear...Know ye, O my brother,that fear is anobstacle great; be master of all in the brightness, the shadowwill soon disappear.Hear ye, and heed my wisdom, the voice of LIGHT is clear,seek the valley of shadowand light only will appear.\"Those who dabble in what has become known as the \"occult\" open themselvestomanipulation by the lower fourth dimension, that home for manymisguided,malevolent, entities, and the origin of the legends and tales ofdemons and \"evil\"142Children of the Matrixspirits. In fact, the word \"occult\" has been given an unfairly bad name. Itmerelymeans \"hidden\" and the same knowledge can be used for good or ill.Againvibrations are the key. If you use the \"occult\" knowledge with love in yourheartand with positive intent, you maintain a high vibration and so connect withthatlevel of consciousness. If you use it without understanding (like those whoplaywith ouija boards) or with ill intent, you connect yourself with thevibrationalrange that this represents - the lower fourth dimension. The emphasisin the tabletson living without fear is also a vital point. As I have beensaying in my books,videos, and talks for many years, the world is controlled byfear. The fear of whatothers think of us; fear of death; fear of being alone;fear of poverty, fear for ourfamilies and children; fear of war. The list isendless. The emotion of fear resonatesto the frequency range of the lower fourthdimension and so when we areconsumed by fear we are much easier for the entitieson that dimension to influenceand control. So the Illuminati continually createsituations, structures, and events,like wars, designed to keep the people infear of so many kinds. Also, when wegenerate fear, that energy can be absorbedby the fourth-dimensional entitiesresonating to the same frequency and they usethis increased power to recycle backagainst us in further control. Fear connectsus to them and feeds them energy.\"In ages past were they conquered by the Masters, driven below to the placewhencethey came. But some there were who remained, hidden in spaces andplanesunknown to man. Live they in Atlantis as shadows, but at times theyappeared amongmen. Aye, when the blood was offered, forth came they to dwellamong men.\" ...Out of the great deep were they called by the wisdom of earth-man, calledfor thepurpose of gaining great power.\"Some researchers suggest that this reptilian faction was banished from theEarthin the far distant past by closing the interdimensional \"portals\", whichallowedthem to move into this density very easily. These portals are points onthe Earth'senergy grid where the third and fourth dimensions can connect andthese are oftenthe places held most sacred by the ancients. The portals aresimilar in theme, if notdetail, to the one featured in the film Stargate, which,you may recall, was the storyof an ancient Egyptian people controlled byhigh-tech, extraterrestrial \"gods\". Atheme of the Atlantis legends is thatgroups with the advanced knowledge beganto use it malevolently and it was thenthat they re-opened the portals and allowedthese fourth-dimensional beings toflood back into this reality. One major portalappears to be in the CaucasusMountains in southern Russia/northern Turkey, aregion that constantly comes upin my research. These important centres for thebloodlines and the Illuminatiwill also be connected to the undergroundsettlements of their masters, also. TheSatanists in their rituals summon these lowerfourth-dimensional entities intotheir presence by creating the vibrational\"doorways\" that allow them tomanifest. Words, colours, and symbols all vibrateenergy - everything does - andthe secret rituals use the combinations that have143the required vibrational effect. This is why the Illuminati today conduct thesamerituals to the same deities that the ancients did. They must do so becausetheyinclude the necessary, word-colour-symbol, combinations to unlock thevibrationaldoor. Researcher Alan Walton writes: \"Some claim that the Crowleyan[Satanic]rituals and Montauk [technology] projects have been very useful tothemin...tearing holes in the fabric of space-time that separates our dimensionfromtheirs.\" 1 think that nuclear explosions since the 1950s have also had theeffect ofopening the \"stargates\".10 As the Emerald Tablets say: \"Yet, beware,the serpent stillliveth in a place that is open, at times, to the world\" (lowerfourth dimension,accessed through the stargates); \"Unseen they walk among theein places wherethe rites have been said.\" (Illuminati rituals to open thestargates); \"Again as timepasses onward, shall they take the semblance of men”(which they have). Thedepiction of the \"Devil\" is very like the descriptions ofthe reptilian \"royalty\"known as the Draco and in the Biblical text theDevil/Satan is clearly said to havebeen reptilian. One example is thisdescription in the Book of Revelation of StMichael, a Phoenician deity,defeating the dragon. The second paragraph herecould easily be describing thesealing of the interdimensional portals throughwhich the reptilians enter thisdimension, the same theme you find in the EmeraldTablets. Or, just as easily, itcould refer to the imprisonment of the serpent racewithin the Earth:\"And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called theDevil andSatan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to Earth andhis angelswere cast down with him.\"...And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil andSatan, andbound him for a thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shutit, and sealedit over him, that he should deceive the nations no more.\"11There were, and are, physical reptilians and other entities also within theEarth,as I outlined earlier, and this Biblical passage could relate to thereferences in theEmerald Tablets to the reptilians being \"driven below to theplace whence theycame\"...and...\"Out of the great deep were they called...”. Itis said of the Nefilimand the giant Titans under their different names that theywere banished into theEarth and out of the sunlight. One mind-controlledsurvivor says he learned thatthe reptilians were the first to colonise the Earthand that is why they consider ittheirs. Credo Mutwa, from the African accounts,says precisely the same and I haveheard this from many other sources. Theysuggest, along with other researchers,that another, more \"human\" group, arrivedand won a surface battle with thereptilians who went underground to escape. Thisis one origin of the symbolism inthe ancient theme of \"Hell\" and \"Satan\" beinglocated underground. This more\"human\" group was the blue-eyed blonds. The mindcontrol victim believes thatthis battle happened some 200,000 years ago. Headds:144Children of the Matrix\"The original reptilians are coming back, they are here now, and the oneswhoremained on this planet developed their own little sub-culture, which wentagainstwhat the overall plan was. And now they're afraid of their own people.There's a lot ofscurrying around, if you want to call it that, to protectagainst the original populationthat's coming back and there's going to be agigantic battle on this planet in the nextfew years. I think there's going to bewar and the human-reptilian hybrids that arehere are going to defend themselvesagainst the originals, the true-breds.\"These claims and the themes of the Emerald Tablets point yet again to anancientconflict between reptilians and the Nordics from various locations in thegalaxy.Maurice Doreal, who claims to have found the Emerald Tablets, said thatafter alecture in California he was approached by two blond-haired, blue-eyedmen whoinvited him to visit an underground city under Mount Shasta innorthernCalifornia. Researchers and informants have called this city Telos, aGreek wordthat means \"uttermost purpose\". Doreal says that his visits toundergroundsocieties, especially a centre for ancient records under theHimalayas, showed himthe true history of this planet. He says that ancestors ofthe Scandinavians oncelived in a tropical region that is now the Gobi Desert inChina-Mongolia. Theydeveloped a technological society that included nuclearenergy and the flyingmachines the Vedic records call vimanas. These Nordics wereconstantly challengedby a race of reptilian shape-shifters based in the thensub-tropical Antarctica, Dorealsays he learned. It is certainly true that thePleiades (Nordics?) and Orion(reptilians?) are said in ancient texts to be, atleast symbolically, associated withdeath and destruction on Earth. Antarctica iswhere, apparently, some Nazis fledafter the war and there are many tales of anunderground base there. Doreal says hewas shown how these \"chameleon\" reptiliansinfiltrated human societies in theirbattle for control of the planet. One waythese shape-shifters were exposed, he says,is by a language test. It wasdiscovered that the reptilians found it impossible topronounce the word\"kin-in-i-gin\". (Go on, 1 bet you can't resist it!)Doreal says that in a desperate effort to stop the reptilians, the\"Nordics\"launched a \"super weapon\" at Antarctica. He suggests that the enormousexplosionshook the Earth and made it wobble on its axis. The poles shifted andfantasticcataclysmic events ensued. Other reptilian colonies survivedunderground. Onelocation, according to researcher, Alan Walton, could have beenthe caverns of\"Patalas”. Hindu tradition says this is a seven-levelledunderground societystretching from Benares in India to Lake Manosarowar inTibet. Walton says thatsome local people have allegedly encountered thereptilian \"Nagas\" in this regionand seen their flying craft entering and leavingthe mountains. Maurice Doreal saysthat the \"Nordics\" also moved much of theircivilisation underground, especiallyinto the underground networks known in theeast as \" Agharta”.12 The conflicts havecontinued between them, but there hasalso been collaboration between thesereptilian peoples and factions of theNordics. Robert E. Dickhoff in his book,Agharta (Health Research, U.S.A., 1996)tells of a Tibetan monk who learned that analliance of reptilians and \"human\"black magicians were causing chaos andThe shape-shifters 145destruction in the surface societies by projecting malevolent energy fields intothepeoples' minds, using what we call witchcraft - the manipulation of energy.Dickoffsays that the monk led 400 warrior-monks into the caverns to do battlewith this\"serpent cult\" of humans and reptilians.This theme of a serpent cult battling with the Nordic \"humans\" can also befoundin an ancient British work called the Edda, translated by L.A. Waddell inthefirst half of the 20th century. He knew nothing of extraterrestrialreptilians andNordics, and yet his translations give much support to thisancient tussle for poweron the planet. They also confirm another aspect of theIlluminati-reptilian ritual -the worship of their goddess.SOURCES1 Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips, Trance-Formation Of America, The True LifeStory Of ACIA Mind Control Slave (Reality Marketing, PO Box 27740, Las Vegas,Nevada, 89126,1995), pp 209 and 210.

I found this story of Maurice Doreal's experiencesonhttp://www.angelfire.com/ut/brantonCHAPTER9the dragonqueensIf you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.Mark TwainThe Illuminati appear on the surface to be a male-dominated operation. But.infact, the high priestess is as important in their rituals as the high priestand at theheart of Illuminati symbolism is the worship of the goddess - theserpent goddess.The New Age movement wants a return of the \"goddess\" because itis equatedwith female energy and releasing women from suppression. On thatlevel, so do I.But it is vital for New Agers and others to understand that thisis not the \"goddess\"symbolism the Illuminati and their placemen talk about. Theyjust want you tothink it is. The serpent goddess is known under countless namesaround the world,including Diana, Artemis, Athene, Semiramis, Barati, Britannia,Hecate, Rhea,Persephone (\"First Serpent\") and so on. These same names have alsobeen used tosymbolise esoteric concepts like the phases of the Moon and femaleenergy, but atits foundation this goddess worship of the Illuminati would seemto relate to theDNA transmitted through the female and possibly originating inthe constellationof Orion. I have heard this DNA source symbolised in variouscultures as theDragon Queens, the Orion Queen or Queens, and the \"Snake Mother\".From what Iam told by insiders and serious researchers, the full-blown reptiliansociety has itsown version of queen bees, which produce the eggs from which thebloodlines andtheir offshoots, originate. Artemis, a key Illuminati goddess, isdepicted with eggsall over her chest and she is associated with bees. One of theprime symbols of theMerovingian bloodline, so connected to Artemis/Dianaworship, is the bee and thehive. You also find this symbolism in Freemasonry.The reptilians and greys havebeen described over and over by abductees andexperiences as having a kind ofswarm or hive mentality, very much like bees, andthey have worked to make thehuman race a mirror of that. Researcher Frans Kampalso came across this theme ofthe Orion Queen:\"The Bee-queen has a herd. The memories of the herd/swarm are transferred tothemby the female/queen. A chemical substance/hormone 'pheromones' is requiredforthis in the same way as melotonin is needed for more intuition[interdimensionalconnection]. The memories are the typical rules of behaviour ofthe herd. An animal is146pure subconscious. He lives on intuition. We call that paranormal. We humansuseour brains. We think that brains do everything. The rest is instinct. Wellinstinct issubconsious. Our DNA knows everything. Your DNA/subconscious keepsyou alive,not your brains. As the Orion people are still animals in the fourthdensity, they areby their collective subconscious connected with each other bytheir queen. TheOrion Queen. Every swarm has its own queen. She has the purebloodline...themitochondrial DNA is only transferred by women and is thestrongest DNA there is.\"1I have been told many times that the DNA carried by the female in thereptilianbloodlines is the most important to them and the symbolism of the\"goddess\" andthe \"serpent\" have been linked since ancient times. Sir LaurenceGardner is aspokesman for the Imperial Royal Dragon Court and Order thatrepresents theinterests of the \"Dragon bloodlines\" seeded by the DNA of the\"Dragon Queens\".He says that this symbolism and the theme of the Dragon Queensgoes back tothe \"founding mother\" of the Anunnaki he calls Tiamat, theSea-dragon inMesopotamian accounts. These queens, he suggests, were commonlyrepresented asmermaids (amphibious/Sirius?), and were often called Ladies of theLake (seehttp://www.nexusmagazine.com/ringlordsl.html). Throughout the landssettled bythe former Atlantean-Lemurian peoples you find the worship of theserpentgoddess and her serpent son, who is often symbolised as a bull. JamesChurchwardreveals from ancient tablets and artwork that Lemurians worshipped thegoddesscalled \"Queen Moo\", and that Lemuria/Mu was called the \"Motherland\".Aroundthe Mediterranean the priest-kings were known as the \"Children of theSerpentGoddess\".2 In this same region, temples and Mystery schools were createdin hername, most notably the Temple of Artemis/Diana at Ephesus in Turkey, oneof theseven wonders of the ancient world. Turkey (formerly Asia Minor), Greece,and theislands of Samothrace, Cyprus, and Crete were among the main centres ofthegoddess cult. Samothrace, \"the Sacred Isle”, seems to have been theheadquartersfor this in the Mediterranean/Aegean region. Here the rites of the\"Sisterhood ofDaughters\" of the Goddess Hecate were performed.3 She was depictedwith snakefeet and snakes for hair.4 Dogs, the sacred animal to Hecate, weresacrificed to herin these rituals during the dark phase of the Moon. Thisemphasis on the dog inHecate myth could connect her symbolically to the \"dogstar\" Sirius, a base for thereptilians. In Colchis, that ancient Egyptiansettlement at the foot of the CaucasusMountains, there was a cemetery sacred toHecate. Jason of the Argonaut legendswas said to have offered a sacrifice toHecate at Colchis.5 (Colches-ter is the oldestrecorded town in England and itsfirst Roman capital). The Illuminati Satanicnetwork continues to performsacrifice rituals to Hecate and this goddess wasmassively part of the symbolismsurrounding the ritual murder of Princess Diana,as explained in The BiggestSecret. Indeed, Diana could well have been a sacrifice toHecate, thetriple-headed goddess with the symbolism of Sirius, Sirius B, and SiriusC. Thename, Hecate, literally means \"One Hundred\".\" Both Sirius B and C take 50yearsto orbit Sirius A and the symbolism of one hundred, the duel orbit of\"thetwins\", was often used as code for the Sirius system, according to RobertTemple in148Children of the MatrixPicture #22 [images/img_0022.png]The Sirius Mystery. It is also important to notethat, as Temple points out, theancientEgyptian word and hieroglyph for goddessalso means serpent, and theirhieroglyph forSirius also means tooth. Thus the stories of the\"serpent's tooth\"can be read as the \"GoddessSirius\". The Egyptian word for tooth alsomeans dogand, more specifically, dog-godand one hundred.7The Minoan civilisation on Crete, part of| the Sumer Empire, was anotherserpent-bullFigure 18: The United Nations is a wholly- culture. They called itsline of Aryan \"Minos\"owned subsidiary of the Illuminati. Its symbol kings theSons of the Serpent Goddessincludes the laurel leaves and the world in 33 because, once again, the Aryanline is the'purest of the reptilian hybrids. These were theSerpent Kings who ruled Atlantisand the laterSumer Empire. Ancient Crete, as with otherconnected centres, wasfamous for its labyrinth, a word meaning \"House of theDouble Axe” or \"House ofthe Serpent Goddess\".8 Greece was another serpentgoddess culture. They calledher Athene and at Delphi, the Oracles (inter-dimensional channellers) wouldspeak the words of the serpent goddess, knownthere as Delphinia.9 The Oraclewould go into a trance state while staring into theeyes of a snake. She wouldalso use cannabis and chew laurel leaves, the sacredherb of the goddess or\"pythoness”. The laurel leaves are used by the Illuminati inthe symbol ofFreemasonry and the logo of United Nations, in which they frame anEarth brokeninto an esoterically significant 33 segments (Figure 18). Pythagoras, thefamousGreek hero and mathematician, grew up in the mysteries of the serpentgoddesscult and his very name means \"I am the Python\" or \"I am the Serpent\".sections - a constantly recurring esotericnumber, as in the 33 degrees of theScottish jRite of FreemasonryDNA of the dragon queensThe author, Sir Laurence Gardner, says that the ancient Imperial RoyalDragonCourt and Order can first be identified as the Dragon Court of ancientEgyptunder the patronage of the priest-prince Ankhfn-khonsu in about 2170BC.It laterbecame a \"pharaonic institution\" thanks to Queen Sobeknefru(C.1785-82BC) andoperated as a sort of \"royal academy\", a \"unique assemblyof science andscholarship\". That's according to its official website,anyway(http://www.mediaquest.co.uk/RDCsite/RDChome.htm). The Dragon Courtwasre-launched in the 15th century as the Hungarian Court of the Dragon andwasstrongly connected with \"Dracula\". Gardner calls himself \"Chevalier deSaintGermain and Attache to the Grand Protectorate of The Imperial and RoyalDragonCourt and Order - Ordo Dragonis, Sarkany Rend, 1408\". He loves titles, oldLarry.He has written a number of books, including Bloodline Of The Holy Grail(ElementBooks, Shaftesbury, Dorset, 1996), in which he claims that theMerovingians andtheir offshoots, like the British House of Stuart, were seededby Jesus and MaryPicture #23 [images/img_0023.png]Magdalene. This is not the case, as we'll see, although there could be somesymbolictruths in the theme of a \"Jesus\" and \"Mary\" bloodline. Gardner, in myview,knows far more than he is telling, although, if you read between the lines,he'salready telling quite a lot. He has been given great prominence by theAustralia-based Nexus magazine, which claims to expose how the world ismanipulated.Gardner says that bloodlines (the \"Dragon Kings\") were specially conceived bytheAnunnaki to rule on their behalf. He says that they drank menstrual bloodknownas Star Fire, but he doesn't mention the blood they drink from the victimsofhuman sacrifice right to this day. The drinking of menstrual blood, symbolisedas\"red mead\" or \"red wine\", goes back to the dawn of history and manyancientcalendars were based on the Moon-menstrual cycle. The Greeks called itAmbrosia(\"supernatural red wine\" of the goddess Hera), while in India it wasSoma (the foodof the gods) and in Persia, haoma. They believed the menstrualblood was sacredand the life essence that could bring immortality. Sir LaurenceGardner calls theAnunnaki bloodlines the \"dragon bloodlines\", but claims thatthis derives onlyfrom the use of crocodile fat in the royal ceremonies ofancient Egypt. Right, Larry,and I can hang by my willy from a hot air balloon.He dismisses any idea that thesebloodlines are reptilian shape-shifters,although he acknowledges that such claimswere made in ancient times. He said ina Nexus magazine article that he found ithard to imagine that anyone (i.e. me)could still believe such stories in these moreenlightened times. Mmmm. Therecords of Sumer, Gardner says, reveal that theAnunnaki had a \"creation chamber\"to produce these \"royal\" bloodlines and hesays that the senior line of descentwas determined by the \"Mitochondrial DNA ofthe Dragon Queens\". Gardner talks ofthe \"Blood Royal\" or Sang Graal in the\"womb of the Dragon Queen\". Other texts inFrance called this bloodline, \"LeSerpent Rouge\" - the red serpent or the serpentblood.10 The female or \"goddess\"DNA is most definitely the key here.Rennes-le-chateauThe Cathars or Albigensians, who were slaughtered by the Roman Church in the13thcentury, were supporters of the \"elven\" or dragon bloodline, accordingtoGardner. A female elf was called an elbe, he says, and this is the inspirationfor Albi,the main city of the Cathars or Aligensians, in their stronghold in theLanguedocregion of southern France. \"Gens\", as we saw earlier, relates to tribeand is used tothis day as a code for the bloodlines. The Cathars appeared to beclose to theKnights Templar, who also had a major presence in that same areaaround themysterious mountain-top village of Rennes-le-Chateau. Could thismountain havebeen an inner-earth entrance to a reptilian base? It certainlyseems to be aninterdimensional doorway. 1 have been all around there and thewhole area has avery strange vibe. The horrific slaughter of the Cathars byarmies of Pope Innocent111 and the Roman Church ended with the siege of theirmountain-top fortress atMontsegur in 1244. Gardner's contention is that theRoman Church destroyed the\"dragon\" succession when it removed the Merovingiansfrom power in the 8thcentury and began to appoint its own monarchs, includingCharlemagne, in what150Children of the Matrixlater became France. Gardner says that the church also suppressed the femaleandworship of the \"goddess\" (Dragon Queen) with its male-dominated religion.\" Ibegto differ. We shall see that while the Roman Church and Christianity ingeneral is anoutwardly male religion, it is secretly a continuation of pagangoddess worship.Also, the reptilian bloodlines constantly fight with each otherfor power, and theRoman Church, Charlemagne, and the Merovingians were differentexpressions ofthe same reptilian bloodlines battling with each other to be topdog - as usual.The British EddaThe story of a battle between the Nordics and a reptilian force for control oftheplanet is told in some considerable detail in the Edda, the epic ancientBritishaccount of the events in Sumer and elsewhere, translated by L.A. Waddell.Theemphasis by the serpent cult on the female is also confirmed. The Edda textwasfound in Iceland in the 12th century and was believed by scholars to be ofIcelandicand Scandinavian origin. Waddell reveals in his book, British Edda(Christian BookClub, California, 1929) that it is actually written in OldBriton, a language closelylinked to Old English, Anglo-Saxon, and EasternGothic. And Gothic came from theSumerian, which came from Atlantis/Lemuria. TheEdda is not of Icelandic origin,but British.12 It was taken to Iceland, itappears, by settlers from Scotland, Orkney,the Hebrides, and North Britain.Among them were the Culdees, who had theirheadquarters at St Andrews inScotland, an area with strong Illuminati connectionsto this day.13 The \"Culdees\"came from \"Chaldees\", a people who followed theSumer Empire in Mesopotamia andworshipped the mother-son cult in which theyclaimed that God's son had died tosave them. This was long before Christianity.And, of course, these northernlands of Europe were the realms of the Nordics whowent south to the Near andMiddle East thousands of years ago before returning asthe \"Sumerians\", the\"Phoenicians\", and the \"Egyptians\". Scholars havemisrepresented the Edda, notleast because an Icelander called Snorri Sturlason(1179-1241) included histranslations of this text in his own work. This led to theerroneous idea that hehad compiled it. But he merely used sections from it andmistranslated them to alarge extent. He mistook the titles and personal names ofthe same person to benames of different people and the whole meaning was lost.14Waddell again usedhis knowledge of ancient languages to retranslate the Edda andhe says it tellsthe story of events in ancient Troy and Cappadocia, both now inTurkey, and theDanube Valley in Europe. These events and their heroes and villainsbecamefoundations for myths and legends throughout the former Sumer Empireand laterentered the texts that became the Bible.You are going to be hit by a stream of names, symbols, and connections inthischapter. You might get a headache in the next few minutes, but understandinghowdifferent names and titles refer to the same people can unlock so manymysteries.The themes running through this chapter and the names, titles, andsymbols I willintroduce, are: (a) the battle between the \"Nordics\" and thereptilians or serpentcult; (b) the interbreeding between the Nordic andreptilian bloodlines; and (c) thefundamental importance of the goddess to thereptilians. L.A. Waddell first began151to see the connections between apparently unconnected people and eventsduringhis early days in India while studying Hindu history and mythology. Henoticedthat Eindri, the name used in the Edda text for the European and Norse\"god\"called Thor, was remarkably close to the Hindu god, Indra. The IndianVedas,which were inspired by the Lemurian and Sumerian legends and accounts,describeIndra as tall, fair, invincible, and armed with a bolt. This is howEindri or Thor isdescribed in the Edda and Waddell concluded from considerableresearch that theEuropean god, Thor, and the Hindu god, Indra, were the sameperson, and that thisguy was also the first \"Aryan\" king of Sumer. The Vedasconnect Indra to the Greekgod Zeus, also known as Jupiter. Some Sanskritscholars regarded Indra as the sameas Jupiter and suggested that he was a heroichuman king who had led the earlyAryans or \"Nordics\" to victory against the\"serpent cult\". Waddell produces astream of evidence to show that the Hindu god,Indra, and the European, Thor,after whom we get Thursday or \"Thors-day\", are thesame person or deity. He alsosays that the legend of Thor is the origin of thelegends of King Arthur. Thor isknown in the Edda as Her-Thor, which becameAr-Thur. Both Her and Ar comefrom the same root meaning...Aryan.15 The mistbegan to clear even further whenWaddell observed that the name of the firstAryan king of the Sumerians in ancientMesopotamia had the name of Indara, InDur, In-Tur, or King Tur.16 This, Waddellsays, later became Thor of northernEurope and Prometheus of the Greeks. Indarawas the traditional founder ofcivilisation and was deified by the Sumerians.17 Hewas said to have defeated thedemons and slayed the serpent-dragon and the\"giants\", and his Sumerian titlesare identical in the Sumerian and the Edda, wherehe appears as Eindri or Thor.Like Thor, Indara was also portrayed with a hammerby the Sumerians. The fairystory of Jack and the Beanstalk or Jack the Giant Slayercomes from the tales ofIndara/Thor. A title for Thor in the Edda is Sig or Ygg,which, in Sumerian andCappadocian inscriptions, is spelt Zagg or Zakh. This is theorigin of the modernname, Jack.18 Waddell writes of Indara:\"The Sumerian records regarding him date continuously back to the inscription onhissacred trophy bow! or Holy Grail by his great-grandson, about 3245BC ...Theycontainfairly full details of the personality and exploits of himself, his queenand son-champion knight, and his warrior-clan of Guts or Goths, with theirportraits chiselled onstone and engraved on their sacred seals, representingthem as wearing horned hatslike the European Goths, Ancient Britons andAnglo-Saxons, and like the Eddie heroesin medieval art. The goat and deermetaphors, pictographic of his name, are freelyapplied to him by the Sumeriansand the Hittites, just as they are to Thor in the Edda.And his capture andconsecration of the sacred bowl or Holy Grail is in agreement withthat by Thoror Her-Thor (Arthur) in the Edda. Indra's sacred Rowan tree, guarded bygoats, ispictured by the Sumerians and the Nordic-Aryan Hittites and Cappadociansand thisis precisely described as Thor's 'Ygg-drasill' Rowan tree in the Edda.\"19Waddell presents more than 100 seals and sculptures from Sumer and theHittitesthat portray scenes described in the British Edda. He says he could have152Children of the Matrixpublished 300. There is no doubt,he says, that King Thor orArthur were othernames for thefirst historical Sumerian king,Indara. Later renditions of theKingArthur story lost theseconnections and became aninvented, though highlysymbolic, fable. In Egypt,Waddell says, Indara (Thor) wasknown by the title ofAsari,which became Osiris, the leadingdeity in the Egyptian worship ofthe Sun.Osiris was oftendepicted as a blue-eyed Aryan,Figure 19: This image of Thor orOar defeating the symbolic just as indara was Kina Indaralions of Phrygia (\"TheLand of the Lions\") was carved in ivory Duj. Qr Tur of Su Indra ofon the handle of a knife around 3350BC _ „ , .India, Thor or Eindn or Andvarai(Andrew) of the Edda, Osiris of Egypt, and the original version of King Arthur,areall the same person, Waddell contends. So, he says, is Dar-Danos, the first kingofTroy in Homer's Iliad. Thor was known as Dan and from this same root yougetDanube and Danmark, the Danish spelling for Denmark. The name relates totheDanaans, who originated in Atlantis. The British Israelite movement claimsthat the\"lost tribes of Israel\", especially the Tribe of Dan, moved out of theMiddle East andsettled in the British Isles and Europe. This, they claim, led tothe names Danubeand Danmark and therefore makes the British, and their genetickin, God's \"chosenpeople\". They have, however, completely lost the plot, I wouldsuggest, not leastbecause they are obsessed with the idea that the Bible isaccurate. It is not! The Eddasays that Thor (Dan) and his Aryans went from Europe in the first place tosettle inTurkey and Mesopotamia and found the civilisation of Sumer. That ispreciselywhat happened, as I indicated earlier. It also says that the Aryans ofthe DanubeValley were already well in advance of the rest of the world beforethey went downto Mesopotamia.20 The Danube Valley is very significant to thebloodlines. TheDanube is the second longest river in Europe and runs fromGermany throughRomania (\"Dracula\" country) and into the Black Sea. The Edda saysthat Thorfought and defeated the serpent worshippers of Phrygia (in Turkey), aword thatcomes from the Sumerian name, Firig or Pirig, and it means literally\"Land of theLions\".21 Thor is depicted on ancient carvings symbolically fightingand taming\"lions\" in this battle with the Phrygians (Figure 19) and so we havethe symbolicHebrew story of Dan-iel taming the lion. Thor was also \"Midas\", theking whoturned everything into gold with the \"Midas touch\".2\" His victory overthePhrygians was commemorated in those ancient lands in a monument known astheTomb of Midas, although it is not actually a tomb. On it are nine enormouscrossesof St George (another name for Thor-Indara) and dates to about 1000BC.23Picture #24 [images/img_0024.png]Picture #25 [images/img_0025.png]153The red crossOne of the common themes from Lemuria, Atlantis, through Sumer, to thepresentday Illuminati, is the use of the Sun Cross as a symbol. This cross isthe origin of theChristian cross with \"Jesus”, as we shall see, symbolising theSun at the centre. TheSun-Cross, or Red Cross, was found drawn in red pigment inthe alleged \"tomb\" ofthe Sumerian-Egyptian emperor, Menes, Waddell says. This isthe same symbol thatbecame the \"Cross of St George\" and later the flag ofEngland after Sumerian-Phoenicians settled there. The red Sun-Cross is also thesymbol of the KnightsTemplar secret society which has played a major role in thestory of the bloodlinesover hundreds of years and, of course, it is the logo ofthe Red Cross organisation,which, as I outline in The Biggest Secret, is anIlluminati creation to allow them tomanipulate within countries during wars andother events behind the cover ofhumanitarian aid. The vast majority of genuineRed Cross workers are not aware ofthis. The Red Cross was also flown on theships of Christopher Columbus, anIlluminati frontman, whom historians stillinsist discovered the Americas. The RedCross or Sun-Cross was originally writtenas a T and this became the \"T-square\" ofFreemasonry, or the Tau cross. Thesplayed cross known as the Maltese Cross, sobeloved of British royalty, was alsofound depicted in caves within this same SumerEmpire. This is today the symbolof the Knights of Malta (formerly the KnightsHospitaller of St John of Jerusalemand the Knights of Rhodes). The Knights ofMalta are another elite and extremelysinister secret society and they have beenaround for the same period as theKnights Templar. The ruling bloodlines and theirsecret society web, theIlluminati, are obsessed with symbolism and ritual and, as Ihave indicated, theyuse the same symbols and ceremonies today that theirancestors did who ruled theSumer Empire, Atlantis, and Lemuria.The serpent trinityThe Edda tells the story of how Thor-Indara fought a constant battle withtheserpent cult. The text equates \"St George\", the dragon-slayer ofCappadocia(Turkey), with the European god, Thor, who was also a \"dragon-slayer\".Both weresaid to have fought the \"serpent dragons of the abyss\" - theirunderground cavernsystems and bases? In the Edda, the serpent cult engages inhuman sacrifice andblood drinking. Same old story, and again we see the theme ofthe Nordics or\"Aryans\" in conflict with the serpent people. The Edda says therewere three mainleaders of this serpent cult. They were the serpent goddess knownas El; herconsort, the male entity called Wodan (Votan was the Atlantean firegod); and theirson, Baldr or Balder. This was the serpent \"trinity\" ofmother-father-son. El wasalso known as Eldi or \"Fiery El\", the \"Hound\", and,highly significantly, as\"Mary\".24 From this cult and \"Fiery El\" came the termHell, \"burning in Hell\"and \"fires of Hell.\" El or Hel was the Norse queen of theunderworld and herfollowers became known as \"kinsman of Hel\".25 In Medievaltimes, this wassymbolised as the \"Harlequin\", the lover of the maidenColumbine-the-Dove.Columba, Columbine, and the symbol of the dove are all othernames and symbolsfor El, the serpent or dragon queen of the Edda. The more Iresearch, the more the154Children of the Matrixworld that exists under our feet becomes increasingly significant.Theunderground \"Hell\" is supposed to be the place of judgement andeternalpunishment where the \"Devil\" and evil spirits dwell beneath the Earth.The longerwe go on, the more you will see how relevant this is to the races andbloodlinesthat manipulate this world. El is the Hebrew name for \"God\" and shewas alsoknown as Heidi and Ida. The Elohim, the gods of the Old Testament, werethe raceof El, a dragon queen. The Greeks knew El as Artemis, the cruelmother-goddesswho demanded human sacrifice. Artemis (also known as Diana) wasthe majordeity of the Merovingians. Artemis was symbolised with bees, as istheMerovingian bloodline. It is the same with other versions of the goddesslikeDemeter, the \"pure mother bee\", and a symbol of Aphrodite was agoldenhoneycomb. Her priestess was given the name Melissa, or \"Queen Bee\". Thewordhoneymoon comes from this. It spanned a lunar month, normally in May,whichwas named after the Virgin Maya, another version of El. The honeymoonwouldinclude the menstrual period of the bride and the combination of menstrualbloodand honey was once thought to be the elixir of life. El is also theinspiration for thechildren's stories of Mother Hubbard or \"Mother Hubur\", asshe was to theBabylonians. Mother Hubbard was distressed because she couldn'tfind a bone forher dog (a domesticated wolf)- Mother Hubur, also Tiawath, wasdescribed as the\"Plague, the Fearful Dragon, the Dragon which shines brightly,the female spiritwho devours with a serpent's mouth\". The other members of theserpent trinity inthe Edda, consort Wodan and son Balder, were major \"gods\" ofthe reptilian-controlled Nazis. The Nazis were the creation of the TeutonicKnights network(Illuminati) in Germany which has always been associated with thehighlysignificant reptilian bloodline known as the Habsburgs. The TeutonicKnightsoperated in the same \"Holy Land\" in the same period as the KnightsTemplar andthe Knights of Malta and they work to the same reptilian agenda.Wodan andBalder were national deities of the Teutons. The legendary founder ofthe Mayaculture in Mexico was also called Votan or Wotan.The AmazonsThe Edda refers to the serpent cult as the \"Amazons\", the \"Wolf Tribe\", andthe\"Valkyrs\", and here we have the meaning of the musical work called The RideOfThe Valkeries, composed by Richard Wagner. Hitler once said that to understandtheNazis, you must understand Wagner. The Amazons in ancient myth were a tribeofwarrior women who expressed the characteristics traditionally associatedwithmen. The legend is rampant in Greek mythology, which was inheritedfromSumerian mythology, and the Amazons were known as the Valkeries innorthernEurope, the warrior-maidens from Valhalla. The Greek historian,Herodotus, saidthe Amazons were enemies of the Greeks and he claimed that theylived in thesteppelands of the Ukraine and southern Russia, once known asScythia andSauromatia (sauro = lizard and mater = mother). Other areas claimedfor theirhomeland are Lycia, Phrygia, and Cappadocia, all of which are named inthe Eddaaccounts, and Taurus, Lemnos and Lebos, hence lesbian. The foothills oftheCaucasus Mountains in southern Russia was a major location for the Amazonsandthis would seem to have been a major centre for the interbreeding of theNordicswith the reptilian bloodlines. Libya is another place of Amazon legendand inthose days Libya referred to the whole of North Africa, except for Egypt.TheAmazon River and region in South America was named after these women whenaPortuguese explorer in the 16th century found fighting women there. Legendsandaccounts depict the Amazons as a nomadic people dominated by women andtheyappeared to be extremely ritualistic. Strabo, the Greek geographer, saidthey wouldonly \"mate\" during a special two-month period, just like animals do.Sex wasstrictly for the production of children.26 Among the gods and goddessestheyworshipped was once again Artemis, a later name for \"El\" of the Edda texts, andHecate, the dark Moon goddess and \"goddess of the Infernal Arts\". It appearsthatAmazon means \"Moon Woman\" and this again fits with the Edda texts aboutthe serpent cult.A very important location for the Amazons was Sauromatia, or \"LizardMother\".This is in the region of the Black and Caspian Seas and bordered thePersianEmpire, the land of the Magi initiates. Sauromatia has been connected toEuropeannobility and we can now see why. One theory is that the coats of arms ofPolishnobility, for instance, developed from magical signs of the SauromatiansorSarmatians called \"tamgas\". In fact, Poland was often called SarmatiaorSauromatia.27 Historical accounts say that the Amazons in Sauromatia bred withScythian warriors. The Scythians were a Nordic-Aryan people who moved intonorthern Europe from the Near and Middle East through the Caucasus MountainsandSauromatia, and they included the bloodlines that became the SicambrianFranks and...the Merovingians. Once again we have the theme ofNordic-reptilianinterbreeding. The fusion of the Amazon and Scythian languagebecame known asSauromatian. The Scythians worshipped the same goddess as theAmazons. Theycastrated themselves and wore women's clothing as part of their ritual to thegoddess known by the Greeks as Artemis. One location for the Scythians wascalledPartia or \"Virginland\" in deference to their goddess and when theIlluminati movedin on America they used the same symbolism in naming Virginia.The idea that itwas named after Elizabeth 1st, the \"virgin queen\", is ludicrous.First of all, she wasno more a virgin than Madonna. The Scythians were governedby priestess-queens,who tended to be older women. In 1954 five kurgans or \"queen-graves\" were foundin southern Russia at Pasyryk. These priest-queens performed sacrifices andcaughtthe blood in \"sacred cauldrons\", and went with the men into battle andcast spellsfor victory. This again fits with the Edda texts and is almostcertainly the origin ofthe witches in \"Shakespeare's\" Macbeth. In the Celticlegends the cauldron isassociated with the underground world and has beensymbolically connected to thewomb of the \"death-goddess\". Using this theme,children of the bloodlines come\"out of the cauldron\" - the womb of the women whocarry \"royal blood\", thereptilian DNA. The Moon-sickle used by the Scythians,the mythical weapon thatcastrated the gods, became known as the scythe and wasassociated with the \"grimreaper\". Yet again the grim reaper refers to a goddess,Rhea, who was clothed in a156Children of the Matrixgarment of blood and devoured all of her offspring, the gods. She became theCelticgoddess Rhiannon. Eire, the Celtic name for Ireland, comes from the nameof thegoddess Erinn, a form of Hera or Rhea.The Berber people of North Africa have been associated with the Amazons andstillcall themselves Amazigh. The Amazons included a tribe called the Neuri,who\"turned themselves into wolves.” The term \"Wolf tribe\" is associated withgoddessworship or the She-Wolf. This is probably a version of dog-star worship -Sirius.Credo Mutwa says that the Zulu peoples have long called Sirius the \"Starof theWolf\" and their ancient accounts say that a \"sea-dwelling fish people\"from Siriuscame to the Earth. They looked pretty human, but had skin like areptile, he says.Interestingly, the Edda reveals that the forbears of the Nordicpeoples under theleadership of Thor-Indara were also members of the \"TheSeafaring Wolf Tribe\". AnIrish tribe in Ossory were said to become wolf peoplewhile attending the Yuletidefeast or ritual, and they devoured the flesh ofcattle as wolves before regaining theirhuman shape. This could all be symbolicor it could be connected to the phenomenaof the \"werewolf\" which, according tosome former Satanists, do exist. The legendsof the \"Troll\" or \"Trulli\" demonsalso appear to be associated with the Amazons orValkeries. This is the root ofthe word, Trull, which means loose woman and theTroll could have been a Pagan\"Hag\" or Earth-priestess. Norse myth says that thetrolls waited under bridgeswaiting to eat those who crossed without making anoffering. The Valkeries weresaid to guard the bridge to heaven or the \"Bifrost\".Angels of Death were said toattend a ritual called the trolla-thing.Woden's dayWodan was the consort of the dragon queen, El, according to the Edda, and he isamajor figure in ancient myths. One of the older names for Wodan (also WotanorWoden) is Bodo or Bauta. This corresponds with the Sumerian name of Budu,Butu,or Budun, which means \"The Serpent Footed\".28 In Waddell's translation oftheEdda, Wodan was an aboriginal chief of a Moon and Serpent-Dragon cult seekingtodefeat the Nordic-Aryans of Thor-Indara. We find the same story in theIndianVedas attributed to Indra, their name for Thor-Indara, who was said tohave battledwith Budhnya or \"The Bottom\". Budhnya was known as \"The GreatSerpent of theBottom or Deep.\"29 This was the Puthon or Python of the Greeks,says Waddell.Budhnya and Wodan are the same character. In India, Wednesday or\"Wodens-day\"is known as Budh!30 Interesting how close that is to Buddha, and,according toWaddell, Buddha is a derivative of Woden and Buddha claimed to havehad several\"former births\" as a serpent. The Indian Brahmans adopted the Moonand serpentcult. So too, according to Waddell, did the \"Semitic priests of theNile Valley\".31 Hesays that they replaced the original Sun worship of Asar orOsiris and deliberatelyintroduced the serpent and sacrificial cult to Egyptianculture. Balder, who is El andWodan's malicious son in the Edda, correspondswith the Green Man of the KingArthur legend and Loki, the original of Lucifer,according to Waddell. He says thatBalder is also Lancelot in the Arthur storiesfrom his title in the Edda of \"The Lance-bearer\". Like his mother, El, Balderhas been depicted with wings.157The mother-son cult of the serpentScene one in the Edda portrays a world awash with the violence, humansacrifice,and blood-drinking rituals of \"the Mother-Son cult of theSerpent-Dragon”. Scenetwo sees the arrival of the great reformer, the tall,red-bearded, Eindri or Thor(Indara), who brought civilisation (see picturesection). Waddell believes that he isalso the origin of Adam and this part ofthe story, he says, is massivelymisrepresented in the Adam and Eve, Garden ofEden story in the Hebrew OldTestament. 1 think there is a lot more to the Adamand Eve story and what itrepresents than this, however, and I think if Waddellhad been alive today he wouldhave accepted that himself. 1 feel the Eddaaccounts include symbolic, as well asliteral, accounts and some originated inLemuria. \"Adam”, as Thor/Indara, foughtthe serpent cult of the \"Edenites\",Waddell's translations of the Edda say. If theserpent worshippers were operatingin Mesopotamia before the Nordics arrived, itwould certainly explain why theUbaid culture, which preceded Sumer in the samearea, buried their dead withfigurines of serpent humanoids (see picture section).Waddell's translation ofthe Edda tells of how Thor, the \"dragon-slayer\",established his capital inCappadocia under the name \"St George of the Red Cross\"and thus we have theorigin of St George of Cappadocia, later of England.32 Thiswas Thor/Indara yetagain, says Waddell, and so was St Andrew, the patron saintof Scotland, whichcame from Andvara or Andvari, another name for Thor. Thestory of Georgedefeating the dragon can be found all over the world in variousforms. In Egypt,\"George\" was the Sun god, Ra (Thor/Indara, says Waddell); inIndia it was Indra(Thor/Indara); and in the Hebrew Old Testament, it was Adam,under his title, laor Jah, who slayed the serpent.\" Thor or \"Goer\" (George) killed El,the Matriarchof the serpent cult, the Edda tells us, and she was symbolised asthe\"serpent-dragon\". Thus \"George\" (Thor) defeated \"the dragon\" (El). The storyofGeorge and the Dragon symbolises the battles with the reptilians located undertheEarth. The accounts in the British Edda are confirmed in great detail bydepictionsall over the former Sumer Empire. In a Babylonian seal dated to around3300BC, Elis pictured with the crescent moon of the serpent cult and Wodan isgiven the bodyof a serpent. Satanists worship the reptilians and also the Moon,and have alwaysdone so. The inscription behind El in this Babylonian seal readsIldi or \"Il-the-Shining\", yet another confirmation of the portrayal ofreptilians as \"shining\" or\"luminous\" in some way. El or Ida is given the titleof Rann in the Edda and this isthe origin of the nursing serpent mother andmatriarch, Rann-t, in Egyptian myth,or vice versa.34Serpent cult symbolismThe obsession with Troy and the Trojan War by descendants of theMerovingianbloodline can be understood when you read the Edda. It tells of howThor's Troywas raided by the \"Edenite\" serpent cult led by Wodan. The Phrygianswere serpentworshippers before their defeat by Thor, and totems of the serpentcult were the lionand the wolf. This is why Phrygia means \"Land of the Lions\".Still today theIlluminati use the lion profusely in their symbolism - look atBritain and the British158Children of the MatrixPicture #26 [images/img_0026.png]Figure 20: The highly symbolic royalcrest depicting the lion (theserpentcult/llluminati) and the chained andtethered unicorn (Nordics/humanity)Picture #27 [images/img_0027.png]Figure 21: The crest of the reptilianFlouse of Rothschild is a mass ofIlluminatisymbolism and remarkablysimilar to the royal crestPicture #28 [images/img_0028.png]Figure 22: The crest of the City of London,one of the most significantIlluminaticentres in the world. The two flying reptileshold (control) the crossof St George. Itook this picture at Burnham Beechesroyal family alone. This same serpent cultdescribed in the Edda continues tomanipulate theworld to this day. We call it the Illuminati. TheBritish royalfamily are reptilian \"host\"(possessed) entities who work for the serpentcult/Illuminati and we can now see the truesymbolism of the royal crest with the lionfacing achained unicorn (Figure 20). The symbol ofThor/Indara and his Nordicswas the goat andthis later evolved into the unicorn.35 Thus we havethe symbolismof the lion (serpent cult)controlling and imprisoning the tethered humanrace andtheir great enemies, the Nordics(unicorn). Notice also the great similaritybetweenthe royal crest and that of the House ofRothschild, complete with lion,unicorn and fleur-de-lis (Figure 21). The Greek hero Prometheus is aversion ofThor/Indara/Adam, according toWaddell, and he is depicted in chainsbeingtortured by the \"gods\" (reptilians) for trying toeducate humanity and givethem \"illumination\".He is often depicted holding the flame ofknowledge. The coatof arms of the City ofFondon, one of the global centres for the serpentculttoday, is the St George's Cross being held(owned, controlled) by two flyingreptiles (Figure22). When you drive into the City alongside theRiver Thames, youpass two flying reptilesholding the Cross of St George (see picture section).As1 mentioned before, the reptilian Rockefellerbloodline has placed a gold statueof Prometheusin the Rockefeller Centre in New York (Figure 23).The heraldry andcoats of arms of Poland areanother example. They include the images foundamongall European royalty and aristocracy - theopenly reptilian serpent, griffin,salamander, andcaduceus, plus the sphinx and unicorn.36Rule BritanniaThe accounts in the Edda of the battles betweenthe Nordics of Thor/Indara andthe serpent cultof El, Wodan, and Balder, can explain manyancient and modernmysteries, symbols, andBiblical texts (Figure 24). The Edda tells howPicture #29 [images/img_0029.png]159Picture #30 [images/img_0030.png]Picture #31 [images/img_0031.png]Thor/Indara and theNordic/Aryans came downfrom the Danube region ofEurope into the domain ofthe serpent cult in the Nearand Middle East, especiallythe place known as Eden.After many battles betweenthe Nordics and the serpentcult a peace treaty wasagreed between the entityknown as Thor/Indara/Figure 23: The gold statue of Prometheus with the flame of Adam and the leadersof theillumination at the Rockefeller Center in New York . C1 ,,, , ,serpent cult. El, Wodan, andBalder, the Edda tells us. There is a portrayal of a meeting between Thor/Indaraand El on a Babylonian seal of about 3000BC. The \"peace treaty\" also led to themarriage between Thor/Indara/Adam and a priestess of the serpent cult known as\"Eve\" or \"Gunn-Ifa, the Edda says. The story of the marriage of Her-Thor (Ar-Thur) and his \"queen\" Guin-EVE-re, is a version of this, Waddell suggests.37 Headds that \"Eve\", despite being the \"chief vestal priestess\" of the serpent cultofEden, was, nevertheless, a Gothic \"Aryan\". However, the Edda says that she was a\"ward\" of El and \"born of the Sea-froth or Seafoam kin\". She was laterrepresentedby the Greeks as \"Aphrodite\" or \"Sea-Froth\", and Aphrodite was said to be bornfrom the sea - the amphibious Anunnaki? The constant connection of the goddesswith the sea can be seen with the Phoenician Barati, who became the British\"Britannia\". The famous British song \"Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves\"is not about Britain, but the ancient goddess, which, under different names, hasbeen worshipped by the Illuminati since ancient times. The sea-faring WolfTribe,from which the Edda says the Aryans were also descended, was the serpent cult.Eve herself is described in the Edda as an \"Amazonian\" and a \"Valkyr\", the sameas the other serpentworshippers. So could it bethat this marriage of \"Adam\"and \"Eve\" in the Edda wassymbolic of the interbreedingbetween those of the Nordicand reptilian bloodlines thatbecame known as the\"Aryans\" and the \"serpentkings\"? Their weddingprocession described in theEdda can be seen on HittiteFigure 24: Thor/Indara/George fights with Balder, whose legs are rock sculpturesdating tosymbolically depicted as serpents around 3000BC in King160Children of the MatrixPicture #32 [images/img_0032.png]Thor/Indara/ Adam's oldcapital of Pteria, which isnow Bogaz Koi in Turkey(Figure 25). \"Adam and Eve\"are depicted exchanging across-like emblem and a\"globe” object, whichWaddell says is an applefrom the rowan or mountainash tree. This tree wasThor/Indara/Adam's symbolfor his \"Tree of Knowledge\"and the apple from this treecould be the one in theGarden of Eden story, the\"forbidden fruit\", he says. Inthe Edda, the serpent leader,Figure 25: The wedding of Thor (\"Adam\") and Eve from a rock El, taunts Eve forchangingsculpture near Pteria dating from about 3,000BC. Thor's totem sides and becomingaof the goat/unicorn can be seen beside both him and Eve. Balder priestesS \"ofthe Rowan\"with the double axe is riding the cat-like creature r™ c rThe Edda refers to Eve as\"Idun\", who dispenses life-giving apples to the Goths from their sacredtree.Idun was Adueni or Atueni to the Sumerians and this later becameAthene,mother goddess of the Greeks (Figure 26).The Levite fairy talesWaddell says the Levite priests of the Hebrews took this symbolism andproducedthe make-believe story of Adam and Eve with the serpent in the Garden ofEden inwhich they were punished for eating from the Tree of Knowledge, the rowantree,symbolic of the Nordic religion. The Levites were serpent worshippers of Eland theOld Testament gods, the Elohim, were the reptilians of the serpent cult.The Eddaalso refers to the serpent cult as the Valkyrs of Ur and the Levitesmade theirinvented character of Abraham hail from \"Ur of the Chaldees\". TheChaldeans wereserpent worshippers, the Valkyrs. El also came from Ur accordingto the Edda, andshe was known as Hrimni in the Edda and Ahriman, or \"GreatSerpent\" by thePersians. This is fascinatingly close to the Biblical \"Abraham\".They associatedAhriman with Aeshma. He was the origin of Asmodeus, the Christiandemonaccused of possessing nuns and young women to make them lustful.38 Asmodeusisalso the \"devil\" character mysteriously placed at the entrance to the churchatRennes-le-Chateau in Provence, southern France, which is a mass ofIlluminatisymbolism and includes references to the Priory of Sion, the secretsociety of theMerovingians. The little church at Rennes-le-Chateau is dedicatedto MaryMagdelene, a symbolic name for the reptilian bloodlines passing throughthe femaleline - the Dragon Queens like El. 1 have heard that MAG is a code forthe reptilian161Picture #33 [images/img_0033.png]bloodlines passed through the femaleDNA and that MAG relates to queen.The churchat Rennes-le-Chateau wasredesigned in the late 1800s by the priestAbbe Sauniere,who became extremelyrich after discovering coded manuscriptsand other artefacts.The story is told atlength in The Biggest Secret.Cain and Abel?The Edda describes howThor/Adam/Indara and \"Eve\" had a soncalled Gunn, Ginn, or Kon. This istheBiblical \"Cain\" and \"Gawain\" of the KingArthur stories, Waddell contends.InBabylonian seals dated to before 2500BC,he is called\"Adamu-the-son-of-the-god-Induru”. Gunn or \"Cain\" was attackedand wounded in theEdda narrative byBaldr or Balder, the son of the serpent cultleaders, Wodan andEl. Balder is the sameguy as the Biblical \"Abel\", Waddell says,and the Eddarefers to him as Epli, whichequates with the Hebrew E-b-1, and hisSumerian titlewas Ibil or Bal (the HebrewBaal, says Waddell). Baal worship wouldtherefore beserpent worship. AnotherFigure 26: The Sumerian goddess Adueni or Atueni name for Balder was Egil andthis isdepicted as Athene in a Greek vase painting of the almost identical to Egel, theHebrew for5th century BC. She is dressed as a warrior \"a buU calf- and the \"Golden Calf\"goddess of the Amazons or Valkyries. Note the , ■ , ■ , T . .39, . . , ' , . worshipped in the Old Testament,snakes around her shoulders and the mass of , , „swastikas on the robe Golden Calf worship = serpentworship? Balder was symbolised as abull or steer and became the \"Steer god\" ofIsrael or Isra - El. He is referred to inthe Edda as the \"Steer of Eden\". Balderis also called \"the young Hydra\". In Greekmythology, the Hydra is a nine-headedserpent monster with poisonous breathand when one head was severed, two wouldgrow in its place. It was killed in thesecond of the 12 labours of the Sun god,Hercules. The Edda says that Thor/Indara/Adam called his Cappadocian capital,Himin or \"heaven\" and that Balder(\"Abel\") of the serpent cult went to Thor'sbanqueting hall in Himin/Heaven.There he began a riotous quarrel and insultedEve. With this, Balder of theserpent cult was ejected by Gunn or \"Cain\" or Miok(Michael), the son of Eveand Adam. This is the origin, Waddell says, of StMichael casting out Satan/Luciferfrom heaven.40162Children of the MatrixPicture #34 [images/img_0034.png]Figure 27: The serpent cult goddess, El, symbolised .as a flying dragon byEgyptian mythologyThe battle of EdenThe Edda tells of a war between theserpent cult and the forces ofThor/Indara(for control of Eden. As Waddell remarks,the whole feel of theWolf-tribe, serpentcult, offensive in the \"Battle of Eden\"includes theanticipation of bombing byaeroplanes, red-hot missile projections,the belchingforth of fire and poisonousclouds of smoke. He says it vividlysuggests the\"hellish methods of.destruction in modern warfare\" and thisis in line withSumerian accounts ofbattles involving the Anunnaki. In partsof the Edda and inSumerian and Hittite seals, both El and Balder are given \"wings\"(Figure 27). Inthe Indian Vedas you have accounts of the gods warring in the sky. Itsuggests acredible explanation for the ancient ruins that indicate they weredestroyed bysome kind of high-tech, even nuclear, weaponry. The Edda tells howThor won thevictory against the serpent cult and this is known as the \"Harrying ofHell [El]\"in Welsh traditions. A key moment was when Prince Cain, Miok orMichael, the sonof Thor, killed Balder or Abel, the son of El, and this is depicted inmanySumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, and Persian seals and sculptures.Cain,as Horus, is seen spearing Abel-Set, symbolised as a demon crocodile, inanEgyptian bas-relief of around 1000BC (see picture section).41 This is aversion of StMichael defeating the Dragon. St Michael, the Sumerian-Cappadociandeity, isportrayed as a dragon fighter. In India, Balder is the \"great Deva\"(Tiva, or \"Devil\")felled by Lord Gan (Cain).4\" The stories of St Patrick inIreland say that he was sentthe Victor\"\"snakes\"Ireland.When theothersby \"St MichaelPhoeniciansfrom the Sumer Empirelanded in Britain theynamed many placesafter St Michael, as withSt Michael's Mount inCornwall. When theChristians began tobuild their churches onthe ancient pagan sites,they inherited the nameSt Michael for many oftheir churches. TheEdda describes how El,or Old Mary\" as it Figure 28: Thor under his name Andara (later St Andrew) slaysthe dragoncalls her, fled from the on a Hittite seal of around 2300bcPicture #35 [images/img_0035.png]163battle by boat on the Euphrates as the battle was lost, but she was caught andkilledby Thor/Adam (Figure 28). El and her son, Balder or Abel, are bothrepresented ascrocodiles in some depictions of their demise.The phoenix risesAfter this defeat, the reptilians and their serpent cult went underground. Infact,they possibly came from underground. Rollins Ancient History, publishedaround1907, says that Eden was inside a mountain.43 It says that the two majorrivers ofMesopotamia, the Tigris and Euphrates, have their sources on oppositesides ofMount Taurus. This was a region populated by the Amazons and the serpentcult.Rollins adds that these rivers flowed \"through” the mountain of \"Eden\",which, hesays, was artificially constructed by the gods. These rivers,therefore, watered the\"Garden of Eden\". That may well be correct, but 1 feel theoriginal \"Eden\" wasLemuria. Thor/Indara and his successors expanded what becamethe Sumer Empirein the way I described earlier, as far as Britain, the Americas,even Australia. But theEdda tells how the serpent cult returned to power afterThor's death and that \"She(El) still lives.\" It infiltrated the Nordic DNA inthe \"royal\" bloodlines and possessedtheir bodies, as described in the EmeraldTablets. The serpent cult regrouped andeventually made its headquarters inBabylon. From there it began to infiltrate itsagents and bloodlines into thepositions of royal and religious power across theformer Sumer Empire, not leastin Egypt. These Children of the Serpent took controlof the Mystery schools andthe state religion, and turned them into vehicles of thereptilian agenda.How much of Waddell's translation of the Edda is literal and how much issymbolicis difficult to tell. He thinks it is literal, but the use of symbolism wassofundamental to the ancients, and it is unlikely that the Edda would be anexception.My jury is still out on the precise meaning, or meanings, of the Adamand Evesymbolism, for instance, and I think there are Lemurian tales woven intothe story,just as there are Sumerian tales woven into British \"history\". WhatWaddell'sbrilliance has done, however, is to confirm the Nordic-reptilian themeof historyand the focus the serpent cult has with the female or the goddess.SOURCES1 Correspondence with the author2 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 2063 Ibid, p 2084 Ibid5 The Sirius Mystery, p 147164Children of the Matrix6789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536Ibid, p 159Ibid, pp 267 and 268The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 210Ibid, pp 212 and 213In the 1960s, a document of uncertain background called Le Serpent Rouge cametolightin the National Library in Paris containing the genealogy of the Merovingians,two maps of\"France” in the Merovingian period, and a ground plan of St Sulpice,the Roman Catholiccentre for occult studies in Paris.

New York, Vol 2, circa 1907)CHAPTER 10theof themany facesserpent cultThe serpent cult described in the Edda can be connected withChristianity,Satanism, the Nazis, Freemasonry, Hollywood, the death of PrincessDiana,and even the true writers of the Shakespeare plays.Its web of influence is incredibly diverse because it has to work so hardtosuppress human consciousness, which, in its true power, is far greater thanthejuveniles that seek to control. These guys know that humans are potentiallyfarmore powerful and so they have to hit us from every angle to keep us incomatoseignorance. One of their most effective weapons for this has been thepagan cultknown as Christianity.The Christian \"serpent\" trinityThe serpent trinity of El, Wodan, and Balder, the mother-father-son, has beenrepeatedin many guises. The emphasis in the serpent trinity was on the motherand son. InBabylon, that major stronghold of the serpent cult, the \"son\" wasNinus/Tammuz(Balder) and the \"mother\" was Queen Semiramis (El). The Eddaexplains how one ofthe centres for the serpent cult during the conflicts withThor/Indara was the VanTribe of Lake Van on the western side of Mount Ararat inTurkey, the Biblical restingplace of \"Noah's Ark\" after the flood.1 The VanTribe was known as \"The Children ofKhaldis\", Waddell reports, and these becamethe Chaldeans of Mesopotamia and theCuldees of northern Britain. Other offshootswere the \"Vandals\" or \"Hun\" - againreptilian bloodlines. Van or Baina was alsothe ancient capital of the matriarch queenof the serpent cult, Semiramis (El),and I guess this might relate to the Lady of theLake in the King Arthur stories.The underground world is also symbolised as the\"Lake of Fire\", the domain of thedeath-goddess, Hel. Semiramis translates as \"branchbearer\" and her symbol wasthe dove - further links to the Noah story with the dovearriving to Noah bearingthe olive branch. I have seen Lake Van associated with theGarden of Eden by oneresearcher.So the Babylonian mother-son was Semiramis of the serpent cult and herson,Tammuz, the hero of their far earlier version of the \"Jesus\" story. We shallsee laterthat this same serpent cult moved from Babylon to Rome and founded theChristianreligion, as we know it today. The Christian mother-son combination isMary(another name used for El) and \"Jesus\" (Tammuz or Balder). Christianity, ascreatedby the Roman Church, is another form of the ancient mother-son serpentcultreligion. And there's more. Rome is said to have been founded by RomulusandRemus. These are mythical names, but highly symbolic. Waddell points out thatinthe Edda text Rom is another name for Edin or Eden, the home of the serpentcultand the \"Wolf tribe\" of the \"Roms\" (wolf symbolism is associated withSirius). Thesepeople were not Nordics, but similar to the aboriginal darkChaldeans, Lycians, andwhat is called today the Mediterranean or Iberian race.Rom or Romil was also a titleof the Set and serpent worshippers of ancientEgypt. Muslims refer to Turkey/AsiaMinor as Rum, and Romania is the traditionalcentre for the vampire legends.Fascinating, then, that Romulus and Remus, themythical founders of Rome,were said to have been \"wolf-suckled\" and this issymbolic of the mother-soncult (goddess worship) of the Wolf-tribe of the Romswith its associated serpentworship. The names Romulus and Remus came from anancient female clan calledthe Etruscan gens Romulia, the real founders of Rome.Again the female.Mother Mary is El, the \"dragon queen\"It is no suiprise, given its origins in Babylon, that the Roman Church wouldsoemphasise the importance of \"Mary\", the goddess figure, and its version of ElorQueen Semiramis. El was also known as \"May\" or \"Mother May\" and so we haveMayDay, one of the most important ritual days of the year for theserpentcult/Illuminati. The Illuminati-created creed of Communism has its dayofcelebration and military parades on May Day for the same reason (see ...AndTheTruth Shall Set You Free for the detailed background to the Illuminatiorigins ofCommunism). On the night of April 30th, Satanists perform the ritualof Walpurgisto the Goddess of Walpurgisnacht or \"May Day Eve\". She was such apopular deityin Germany as the May Queen, Walpurga, that she was encompassedbyChristianity under the name \"Saint\" Walpurga, and a fictional story producedtojustify this.2 Morgyn la Faye in the King Arthur stories is another version ofEl, as inMaer (Mary) gyn (woman) of the Fey (deadly serpent).3 Mary Woman of theDeadlySerpent - \"Mother Mary\" of Christianity. Morgans were known as\"Sea-women\",as the same water themes continue.4Balder, the son of godThe Edda's version of the death of Balder (\"Abel\") at the hands of \"Cain\" or\"StMichael,\" is told in different versions in many cultures. The Hebrew OldTestamenthas Cain killing his \"brother\" Abel and bringing the first death intothe world. TheNew Testament has St Michael defeating Satan, Lucifer, or the\"Great Dragon\".In Egypt we have the Wolf-headed Set or Seth killed by Horus, theson of Asar orOsiris. In India, Cain is Lord Gan who fought \"The Great Deva\" or\"The Bull\", oneof the Balder (Abel) titles in the Edda. The King Arthur legendshave Sir Gawainslaying the Green Man. As I have said, the Chaldeans called theBalder/Abelcharacter Tammuz. He was their \"Established Son\" and the \"Son of God\"who diedfor humanity. Tammuz was also closely associated with the theme of theserpentand the bloodline of the \"Dragon Kings”. Hecate, another version of El orHel, wassymbolised as the mother of Dionysus, another classic Son of God figure.Both168Children of the MatrixTammuz and Dionysus were mirrors of the much later \"Jesus\" myth. Lamentationsofthe Chaldees for the death of Tammuz/B alder/Abel are preserved in alargecollection of hymns of the mother-son (serpent) cult in Babylonian tabletsfromaround 3000BC. They used to wail for Tammuz in certain rituals and thewailing ofJewish people at the Western or \"Wailing” Wall in Jerusalem is aversion of this. Inthe Old Testament, Ezekiel describes the wailings for Tammuzby Hebrew womenin Jerusalem. Legends also say that to reach the goddess El orHel in herunderworld, you have to cross a wailing river.5\"Jesus\" is BalderWhen the serpent cult moved its headquarters to Rome, it introduced the\"Jesus\"story as we know it today and symbolised Jesus as Balder, the \"crucified\"son of Elor \"Mary\", the Matriarch of the serpent cult, although there is othersymbolismrelating to the Jesus story, also. He is a sort of composite characterthat pulls togethera mass of Mystery school symbolism and themes. Balder is oneof them, but there aremany others weaved into the Gospel tales. On the cross,\"Jesus\" is made to say: \"MyEl-lo-i, lama sa - bach-tha-ni\" which is translatedas \"My God, my God, why hastthou forsaken me?\" Lauren Savage, the webmaster ofdavidicke.com and long-timeresearcher into these subjects, once studied with thefamous American scholar DrVendyl Jones, the man who originally inspired themovie character Indiana Jones.Lauren tells me that Dr Jones has stated thatthose Biblical words attributed to\"Jesus\" were from a South American languageand that the translation into Englishhad simply been a guess. Now if the \"Grail\"is the womb of the Dragon Queens, thatsacred symbol of the serpent bloodlines,and Jesus is symbolic of Balder, son of theserpent goddess, it suddenly makessymbolic sense of the claims by people like SirLaurence Gardner. He says thatthe Merovingian (reptilian) bloodline is the \"Grail\"bloodline of \"Jesus\" and\"Mary\" Magdalene. With his close connections to theancient Imperial Royal DragonCourt and Order, which serves the interests of the\"Dragon bloodlines\", Gardnerwould surely know the real symbolism of the Grailand Jesus, wouldn't he? Gardnersays that the \"Dragon\" refers to the fact that thekings of this bloodline usedto be anointed in Egypt by the fat of the sacred crocodile.El and Balder weresymbolised as crocodiles and the crocodile was known in Egyptas the \"messeh\",from which we get \"Messiah\" and \"Christ\". The term \"Christ\"means the \"anointedone\" - anointed with the fat of a crocodile. The Hindu godShiva, the \"Lord\" ofthe reptilian Nagas, was also called the \"anointed one\", or\"Christos\" to theGreeks, when he had his willy bathed in menstrual blood. 1 hopeyou're noteating. As Barbara Walker points out in The Woman's Encyclopedia OfMyths AndSecrets, many traditions of the early Gnostic Christians identified theserpentwith Jesus. She says that some Christians believed that the serpent wasthefather of Jesus, having \"overshadowed\" the bed of the Virgin Mary andbegotten thehuman form of the Saviour. This mirrors the legends of Merovee,founder of theMerovingians, and Alexander the Great, both of whom were said tohave beenfathered by a serpent or sea creature. Jewish serpent-worshippers,known as theNaasians, said the serpent was the \"messiah\".Writers who have misrepresented the Edda and other accounts, purposelyandotherwise, have presented Balder as the \"good god\". The Chaldeans (the\"Childrenof Khaldis\" of Lake Van), who followed the serpent cult's mother-sonreligion, saidthat Balder/Tammuz was \"the good god, the beautiful benign andfaithful son\";he was a divine high priest who died for the salvation of theChaldeans, his chosenpeople; he was sacrificed and descended into the underworldand he will return ina \"second coming\" to establish a new heaven and a newEarth. Almost exactly whatthe Christians say about Jesus. James Churchward says,incidentally, that theChaldeans were a \"sect\", not a \"people\". The Scandinavianlegend says that Balderhad a spear of mistletoe thrust into him by Hod, a blindgod. The Christians sayJesus had a spear thrust into him by the blind centurion,Longinus. The Ides ofMarch, or March 15th, was the day devoted to Hod by theancients and this is thesame day the serpent cult leaders of the ChristianChurch chose as the feast day ofthe \"Blessed Longinus\"!6 The obsession thatHitler and the Nazis had withpossessing the \"Spear of Destiny\" relates to itsassociation with their god, Balder orBaldur. Hitler thought that the true spearwas the one owned by the shape-shiftingHabsburg family in Austria, which hadformerly been in the possession ofCharlemagne of the reptilian bloodline. Hebelieved that anyone who possessed itwould be invincible, but it didn't seem tohelp him much after he stole it from theHabsburgs during the annexation ofAustria. Also, the \"Holy Grail\" of the Arthurstories is supposed to be thevessel that caught the blood of Jesus after he waspierced in the side by thespear - the \"serpent\" blood, in fact, of \"Balder\", thelegendary martyred hero ofthe serpent cult or Illuminati. The term Illuminati orIlluminated ones linkswith Balder's name of Loki. This became Lucifer \"the lightbringer\", Waddellsays. Jesus is said to be the \"Light of the World\".The Jewish Lather-Son was also depicted sometimes as an ass-headed mancrucifiedon a tree. Balder, Tammuz, and Jesus are the same entity. The IlluminaticreatedChristianity to fool the people into worshipping symbolic reptilian deitieswhilebelieving they were worshipping the opposite. What was it that AliceinWonderland said?\"Nothing would be what it is,Because everything would be what it isn't.And contrary-wise - what it is, it wouldn't be.And what it wouldn't be, it would.You see?\"The black madonnaWe can now appreciate why Illuminati placemen like George Bush, George W.Bush,Bill Clinton, the British royal family, and others, profess to be suchstrong Christianswhile taking part in Satanic ritual. They know what it reallymeans. To themChristianity is the worship of the serpent gods, especially El andBalder, and otherIlluminati symbols and deities. The Knights Templar secretsociety funded and170Children of the Matrixdesigned the famous Gothic cathedrals that became shrines to the serpentgoddess.Between 1170 and 1270, some 80 cathedrals and 500 churches were built inFrancealone and dedicated to \"Our Lady\" (El, Semiramis, Mary). The KnightsTemplar werecontrolled by the serpent cult/Illuminati, but many of their memberswould have notbeen aware of this - just like the vast majority of Freemasonstoday. The Templarsused the red cross of Thor/lndara/George as their symbol andto all appearancesthey were worshippers of a Christian God - again likeFreemasons today. But at thetop level, they are both expressions of the serpentcult/IUuminati. Their \"Christian\"churches and cathedrals are full of goddess,astrological. Sun, and sexual symbolism,as is Freemasonry. Of course they are.They were both created by the same force. Thegreat cathedrals are located onancient pagan ritual sites. Notre Dame (\"Our Lady\")in Paris was built on a siteof worship to the goddess Artemis/Diana - El. Thereptilian bloodline, theMerovingians, worshipped this goddess on that same locationand Notre Dame iscovered in reptilian gargoyles. The great Cathedral at Chartres,not far fromParis, was built by the Knights Templar on a sacred pagan ritual site. Itwas soimportant that Druids came from all over Europe to attend theceremonies.Chartres Cathedral, like Notre Dame, was a centre for worship of the\"BlackMadonna\" - or El, the Dragon Queen. Until the late 18th century, pilgrimsto Chartresparticipated in a \"Christian\" ritual that paid homage to El or theBlack Madonna.After praying and taking mass in the cathedral, they would descendthrough anorthern passageway to an ancient subterranean crypt under the church.Here theywould pay their respects to \"Notre Dame de Sous-Terre\" (Our Lady oftheUnderworld) - a black ebony statue of a seated woman holding a child on herknees.This again was El and Balder of the Mother-Son serpent cult. The child wasinvariablyplaced on the left knee because Satanism calls itself the \"left-hand path\". Onthe BlackMadonna's head at Chartres was, as always, a crown and on the pedestalis a Romaninscription saying \"the Virgin who will give birth.\" The crown is asymbol of thereptilian bloodlines and is used to signify high rank in Satanism.The Black Madonnawas called \"The Queen of Heaven\" and all these mother-virginswere symbolised as adove. The symbolism of British royalty with its crowns,doves, and lions, etc., are allsymbolic of the serpent cult in power today.The man who did most to advance the worship of the Black Madonna was StBernard(1090 to 1153), the abbot of Clairvaux in France, who founded theCistercianOrder. He claims to have experienced a miraculous religious\"illumination\" whenthe Black Madonna of Chatillon pressed her breast andsquirted three drops ofmilk in his mouth. No, you didn't misread that. Bernard wasalso at the heart ofthe creation of the Knights Templar along with the Illuminati StClair family,who later became the Sinclair family at Rosslyn, near Edinburgh inScotland. Whenthe Knights Templar were formed as a front for the serpent cult,they adopted as their official patroness the \"Mother of God\" or \"Queen ofHeaven\",the traditional names for El-Semiramis. So did the Teutonic Knights, whoarefundamentally connected to the reptilian Habsburgs. The goddess appearedwidelyon chivalric banners and when they fought in her honour, they would screamhername as a battle cry. They were fighting for El under the name of Mary andforBalder under the name of Jesus. This would explain why Christianity, whichclaimsto be a religion based on love, has been such a vehicle for globalgenocide andtorture. The \"Holy Ghost\" of the Christian trinity is also regardedas feminine inHebrew and the early Christian Church considered it to be so.The very name Bible comes from Byblos, home of a shrine to an earlier versionofMary known as Astarte. This shrine dates to Neolithic times and Astartewasbelieved to be the \"true sovereign of the world\". She is worshipped elsewhereasMother Mary, Hathor, Demeter, Aphrodite, and, in India, as Kali. Anotherlocationassociated with the start of Christianity is Ephesus in south-westTurkey. Themythical \"St Paul\" was said to have written a letter to theEphesians, and Greekmyth says that the Amazons founded the city. Ephesus justhappens to have beenthe headquarters of worship to the goddess Artemis/Diana - agoddess of theAmazons. 1 visited Ephesus in the summer of 2000 and on a hillhigh above theancient ruins is a building that is claimed to have been the homeof...Mary, motherof \"Jesus\". Another goddess worshipped by the Amazons wasCybele, the MotherGoddess of all Asia Minor (Turkey); she was taken to Rome fromPhrygia, the\"Land of the Lions” and the serpent cult. Rituals to her includedbaptism in theblood of the sacred bull, who represented her dying consort Attis,of whom Jesuswas a carbon copy. Her temple in Rome stood on the site of today'sSt Peter'sBasilica until the 4th century AD when the Christian Church took over.In fact, apriest of Cybele called Montanus or \"Mountain Man\" identified thedeity Attis withJesus. Some Montanists were locked in their churches byChristians in Asia Minorand burned alive.7 Cybele was the \"goddess of thecaves\", a location where many ofthe saviour-gods in the Jesus mould are said tohave been born. The reptilianunderground network?The red rose of ElThe many versions of El are said to be goddesses of sexuality and fertility, andofthe Moon and Venus. The stone baptismal bowls found in every ChristianChurchare symbolic of the \"magic stone bowl” of the serpent cult or Illuminatidescribed inthe Edda. The Gothic \"Christian\" doorways and the ridges around themaredepictions of the vulva and many even have a clitoris symbol at the top ofthe arch.The same is depicted in windows and especially the rose windows of theGothiccathedrals. At Chartres they have a window featuring the \"Rose of France\"with\"Mary\" in the centre. Rose windows face west, the sacred direction offemaledeities. The red rose is symbolic of the goddess and so we have theRosicrucianswith their red rose and cross symbols. They are a major strand inthe Illuminati weband claim a lineage to ancient Egypt and back to \"Noah\", thatsymbol of thereptilian bloodline. Another elite network is the secret societyknown as the Orderof the Rose, which includes the former Canadian primeministers Brian Mulroneyand Pierre Trudeau, both Satanists.8 Trudeau is famousfor wearing a red rose in hislapel. Some branches of Freemasonry feature therose and cross in their rituals.Once again, the Christian Mother Mary isassociated with the rose because she is asymbol of goddess worship. The Romanscalled the rose the \"flower of Venus\" and172Children of the Matrixthis was a term used for the goddess, including Queen Semeramis. The red rosewassymbolic of female sexuality and the white rose or lily is the virgingoddess.Christians associated Mary with both the rose and the lily and theycalled her the\"Holy Rose\". This is the same title given to the Indian GreatMother. The rosaryused so widely in the Roman Catholic mother-son cult wascopied from the \"rosaryof the mantras\" worn by the Indian destroyer-goddess KaliMa. Arabs called theirrosaries wadija or \"rose garden” and the Latin version ofthis, rosarium, describedthe early rosaries in Mother Mary worship. In Satanism,one of the main codenamesfor babies bred for sacrifice is Rose-mary's baby. Thiswas the name of a film byRoman Polanski, the husband of the actress Sharon Tatewho was murdered withher unborn child by the Satanic \"Family\" of Charles Manson.Tony Blair's LabourParty introduced the red rose as its logo thanks to theIlluminati clone and laterdisgraced government minister Peter Mandelson, whosenickname is the 'Prince ofDarkness\". The other two major UK political partieshave the logos of the dove(Liberal Democrats) and the lighted torch(Conservatives), both major Illuminatisymbols going back thousands of years.\"Shakespeare\" was Lord DraconisThe works of Shakespeare are part of this story, also. The texts are awashwithesoteric and Illuminati symbolism and codes. For instance, the \"Queen oftheFairies\" (reptilian bloodline) in \"Shakespeare's\" A Midsummer Night's Dream,isanother version of the universal goddess called Titania. She was known inlegend asthe great goddess who ruled the \"god-race\", the Titans. Given theIlluminati'sstaggering obsession with symbolism, I feel there was far more tothe sinking of theTitanic (Titania) than ever we have yet realised. Thesegoddesses are fundamentallyassociated with the sea and the underworld - thevictims of the Titanic tragedy in1912 went to both. I don't buy the \"hit aniceberg\" line myself. In southern Russia,Titania (known there as Rhea) was \"theRed One\" and the Romans claimed her to bethe mother of Romulus and Remus, themythical founders of Rome. Titania's king inA Midsummer Night's Dream is calledOberon. He was based on a real-life character,an ancestor of the man who reallyput the \"Shakespeare\" plays together - Edward deVere of Loxley, 17th Earl ofOxford. The American researcher Brian Desborough,among others, has establishedthat the plays were the work of a syndicate ofIlluminati initiates inElizabethan society, headed by de Vere and including SirFrancis Bacon, John Dee,and Edmund Spenser.\" Elizabeth 1st (1558-1603) wasseriousbloodline and known as the \"Faerie Queene\". Bacon was a Knights Templar, theheadof the Rosicrucian order, and the man who oversaw the translation of theKingJames Version of the Bible (see The Biggest Secret for more background).Bacon alsowrote a book called The New Atlantis which described a society thatlater became theUnited States. He also wrote of an \"Invisible College\" whichcovertly controlledevents. One expression of this \"Invisible College\" became theRoyal Society inLondon, which was founded by Freemasons in 1660 to dictatescientific thought. The\"Shakespeare\" plays were encoded with esoteric knowledgehidden in symbolismand phrases that only an initiate would understand. L.A.Waddell points out that173parts of the Edda, compiled at least six centuries before \"Shakespeare\", arewritten ina very similar style to that later called \"Shakespearian\".10 The deVere family was sohigh in the reptilian bloodline that Edward de Vere carriedthe hereditary title ofLord Draconis - the same title awarded to the Draculabloodline of Vlad the Impalerby the ancient Dragon Order now promoted by SirLaurence Gardner. Edward de Verewas a Lord Chancellor of England and hisancestors included Albrey, Prince ofAnjou and Guise in France, who was known asthe \"Elf King\" - Dragon King inother words. The aristocratic Anjou line hasappeared in my books many times. TheHouse of Anjou is part of the House ofLorraine, one of the most important reptilianbloodlines to this day. ThePlantagenet dynasty, which ruled England from Henry 11(1154) to Richard 11(1399), were a branch of the House of Anjou and the seniorbranch was the Houseof de Vere. The royal historian Baron Thomas BabingtonMacaulay wrote in 1861that the Veres were \"the longest and most illustrious line ofnobles that Englandhas ever seen\" with their Merovingian, Pictish, and Scythian(Amazon-Nordic)ancestry.\" Laurence Gardner calls them a \"true kingly line of theElven Race\", acode for reptilian shape-shifters.Freemasons are the serpent cultFreemasonry is the biggest secret society in the world and a front for theserpentcult, although the vast majority of its members are oblivious to this.The hero ofFreemasonry is someone called Hiram Abif. His Freemasonic legend saysthat hewas the \"Grand Master and architect of Solomon's Temple\" who was killedforrefusing to reveal the Masonic secrets. The story has many similarities withthelegend of the death of Osiris in Egypt. Hiram I, the king of Tyre from 969 to936BC, isnot considered the same person as Hiram Abif, although he, too, appearsin thestory of Solomon's Temple. Hiram Abif is also said to have come from Tyre(an oldKnights Templar stronghold) and Ty is a name for Balder. Hiram Abif isthe\"Widow's Son\" in Freemasonry and he is also known to Freemasons as the\"TyrianArchitect\". The code \"Widow\" could represent El, the Dragon goddess, andthe sonmay well be Balder. One of Balder's titles was \"the illegitimate son of awidow\".The code for distress in Freemasonry goes: \"Is there no help for thewidow's son?\"One of the tribes named in the Edda that fought for the serpentcult was also calledHrym and this later became the Germanic tribe, theHermin-ones. The Romanhistorian, Tacitus, said that these descended from Hermin,whom Waddell connectswith the bloodline of Wodan. The worship of the reptiliansand their DragonQueens, and the placing of their bloodlines into the positionsof power, is the secretof secrets held within all the secret societies. JimShaw, a former 33rd degreeFreemason, was initiated into a long list ofFreemasonic orders and offshoots. Afterreaching the highest official levels hesaw what Freemasonry really was and wrotean expose called The Deadly Deception.He was initiated into the 33rd degree of theScottish Rite at the SupremeHeadquarters of the 33rd degree in Northwest 16thStreet, not far from the WhiteHouse in Washington DC. It is built as an Egyptian-type temple and outside aretwo Sphinx-like figures with women's faces. Could thisbe an indication of thetruth about the Sphinx at Giza? One of the \"sphinx\" figures174Children of the Matrixat the Washington temple has a cobra entwined around her neck. On the neckof theother one is the image of a woman, symbolic, says Shaw, of fertilityandprocreation.12 These are some of the gifts associated with goddesseslikeArtemis/Diana. Behind the row of pillars at the front of the building is amassivedepiction of the rising Sun - Horns or, perhaps, the Sun goddess known asSol.Around this Sun are six large golden snakes and inside this Freemasonicholy-of-holies the serpent theme continues. Shaw reports:\"...the thing that is most noticeable is the way the walls are decorated withserpents.There are all kinds, some very long and large. Many of the Scottish Rite degreesinclude the representation of serpents and I recognised them among thosedecorating the walls.\"13Secret society, serpent cult, and goddess symbolism can be clearly seen inthefounding of the United States. Queen Semiramis (meaning \"Branch Bearer\")wasanother name for El and she was symbolised as a dove. L.A. Waddell says thattheIndian Vedic title for El was Sarama - \"The Bitch of the Pani\" or Vans. ThiswasQueen Semiramis, the Amazonian queen of Lake Van and it was apparentlythesource of the tribal title of \"Sarma-tian” for the eastern Vandal \"Turanian\"hordesthat ravaged the early Western World. The Roman serpent cultworshippedSemiramis as Venus Columba or \"Venus the Dove\". Columbe is still theword fordove in French. Columba became a symbolic name for El or Semiramis, thedragonqueen of the serpent cult. So we have Christopher \"Columbus\" (real nameColon),who bore the branch of the serpent cult to the Americas. We also haveBritishColumbia in Canada; the District of Columbia, the home of Washington DC;and astream of Illuminati operations called Columbia Pictures, ColumbiaUniversity, andColumbia Broadcasting, the US network, CBS. One of the mosthorrific events inAmerica in recent years was the shootings at Columbine HighSchool and when youbegin to appreciate the unbelievable obsession the liluminatihave with symbolism,down to the finest of details, that location is not aco-incidence. The English GrandLodge of Freemasonry is also located in London inGreat Queen Street to symboliseits worship of the serpent queen, El. England,one of the headquarters of theliluminati, is known as the \"Mother Country\" andits parliament the \"Mother ofParliaments\". It is all goddess symbolism, as wasBritannia, an earlier name forBritain derived from the Phoenician goddess,Barati or \"Barat-Anna\".Freemasonic heroes like Albert Pike, the Supreme Pontiff of UniversalFreemasonryin the 19th century, have said that Freemasonry is a revival of theancientmystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, Persia, Rome, and Greece. \"Masonryisidentical with the ancient mysteries\", he wrote in his Freemasonic \"Bible\"calledMorals And Dogma. So, of course, you are going to find the same knowledgeandsymbols used in Freemasonry that could be found in the ancient Mysteryschools.Pike tells only half the truth, however, because Freemasonry is not arevival of thoseMystery religions, it is a continuation of them. They never wentaway, onlyunderground. Freemasonry is a wonderful example of how the liluminatihaveThe many faces of the serpent cult175always hidden the truth in a complex mass of degrees, levels,contradictions,mystique, and blatant lies. And no one is lied to morecomprehensively thanthe Masons themselves. Jim Shaw confirms that lower-degreeMasons (theoverwhelming majority) are given false information andinterpretations to keepthem in the dark. Even at the 33rd degree level, theofficial peak, most are toldnothing of the true meaning of Freemasonry, itssymbols and agenda. Symbolism isthe very foundation of the Anunnaki-Illuminatisecret language and codes (see TheBiggest Secret) and Freemasonry calls itself asystem of pure religion expressed insymbols. So misinterpret the symbols and youhave lost the plot completely. Herewe have Albert Pike writing in Morals AndDogma about the Blue Degrees, thebottom three levels that feed into the Scottishand York Rite Degrees:\"The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico (porch) of the Temple. Partofthe symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionallymisled by falseinterpretation. It is not intended that he shall understand them,but it is intended thathe shall imagine that he understands them ...Their trueexplication is reserved forthe Adepts, the Princes of Masonry (those of the 32ndand 33rd degrees).\"14Meanings and... meaningsEven those at the 32nd and 33rd levels are mis-led unless they areinner-circlebloodline. Jim Shaw says there are two meanings given to Freemasons,the exotericto the lower initiates and the esoteric to the higher ones. Butthere is a third - thetruth - and that is given only to a tiny elite ofbloodline initiates and those whoprogress beyond the official levels of thesecret societies to the unofficial Illuminatidegrees. Shaw says that Freemasonryworships nature, the Sun and Moon, throughthe symbol of the phallus. So doesChristianity. The phallus, he says, represents theSun in sexual union with thefemale Earth to bring new life. On one level that is true,but it is still aspin. Take the Freemasonic symbol of the square and compass (Figure29 overleaf).This is always placed over the chair (throne) of the Worshipful Master,which ispositioned to the east in Freemasonic Temples, the direction of the risingSun.Christian churches face east for the same reason. Shaw says thatlower-degreeMasons are told that the square is to remind them that they must besquare or honestin their dealings with all people (excuse me while I laughhysterically). The compass,they are told, is to teach them to \"circumscribe\"their passions, and to control theirdesires. Maybe the paedophile and FreemasonGeorge Bush missed that meeting.Shaw says that later they are told the \"real”meaning, which is that the compass isthe male phallus of the Sun impregnatingthe female Earth, symbolised as thesquare.15 On one level, again, that's true,but to the highest levels of the Illuminati thecompass and square represent theimpregnation that perpetuates the bloodline. TheV and A symbol of Queen Victoriaand the German Prince Albert, both reptilianbloodlines, were designed tosymbolise this also (Figure 30 overleaf) and so is theletter G in the Freemasonslogo. Shaw says that, first, Masons are told the Grepresents \"God\". Eater thatit represents deity and still later that it means geometry176Children of the MatrixFigures 29 and 30: TheFreemasonic square andcompass represent themaleimpregnating the female tocontinue the bloodline and thesame symbolism canbe seenin the V and A crest of QueenVictoria and her high-Masonichusband, PrinceAlbertBut Shaw explains that it really means the male generative principle, the SunGod orphallus. Again, that is one level of its meaning. But to the Illuminatithe G representsthe generative principle of expanding and protecting theirbloodlines. The pointwithin the circle also represents the impregnation of thefemale (circle) and with themale (point). On one level this is another Sunsymbol and can be found on the graveof President Kennedy as a flame and circle,but the real meaning is bloodline. It is thesame with the ship symbols you seeon Freemasonic buildings. The hull is the female(that's why ships are always\"she\") and the mast is the phallus impregnating her.Lower-degree Masons are toldthat the circle and the point represents the individualMason (point) restrictedby the boundary line of duty (the circle). What a hoot. Allthese secret societysymbols and codes have a meaning for the lower initiates (utterbollocks); thehigher initiates (semi-utter bollocks); and for those who make itthrough to thehighest levels of the Illuminati (the true interpretation). In the \"bloodoaths\"(called the \"Obligation\"), the initiate agrees to accept torture and death ifhereveals the \"secrets\". This maintains the compartmentalisation in which thehigherlevels do not reveal their \"secrets\" to the lower levels. In truth, as JimShaw foundout, even at the 33rd degree you are not told anything worthwhile. Thereal businessexists only above the official levels, and only a handful of Masonsever make it there.Freemasonry is a cesspit of deceit and hypocrisy, and theoaths made to the secretsocieties and your fellow initiates override any oathyou may have made to yourcountry or people as a president, prime minister,congressman, Member ofParliament, policeman, or judge. Jim Shaw writes:\"The Mason swears to keep the secrets of another Mason, protecting him even ifitrequires withholding evidence of a crime. In some degrees treason and murderareexcepted. In other, higher degrees, there are no exceptions to this promiseto coverup the truth. The obligations, if the Masonic teachings are to bebelieved, mayrequire a Mason to give false testimony, perjure himself, or (inthe case of a judge)render a false verdict in order to protect a Mason.\"16This has always been the way of the Illuminati serpent cult in all its forms.Andthe vast majority of the world's political leaders, high administratorsofgovernment, judges, policemen, and media owners, have made that oath.Doesanyone still wonder why the truth has never come out until now?Picture #36 [images/img_0036.png]Picture #37 [images/img_0037.png]177The many faces of the serpent cultThe ritual death of DianaThe symbolism of the sacrificial murder of Princess Diana by theserpentcult/Illuminati becomes clear from this background knowledge. El, theDragonQueen, was also known as Hel or Ate (Hate). Still today, Hel-Ate or Hecateis aSatanic deity associated appropriately with hell. After her husband's murderinDallas, Jackie Kennedy travelled to the Greek island of Delos in the southwestAegean Sea. This is the legendary birthplace of Diana and the traditional domainofHecate, the goddess of the \"infernal arts\". Delos is known for this reason astheisland of the dead. Hecate was portrayed as both a virgin and a whore, andagainassociated with the Moon. Another version was the Egyptian, Hequet,whodelivered the Sun god every morning and her totem was the frog, symbolic,appropriately, of the foetus. Crossroads are the sacred places of Diana andherSatanic expression, Hecate. It is at crossroads that the witches and GrandMastersand sorcerers of Freemasonry perform their rituals. Crossroads aresymbolic of thevortex points created where ley lines cross. In ritual sex magicthe wearing of clothesof the opposite sex and the performance of bisexual actsare called \"crossroad rites\".The women involved were called \"dikes\". Rememberthat the Amazon-manipulatedScythians wore women's clothes in sexual rites totheir goddess. Crossroads are alsothe places of human and animal sacrifice andHecate (El) is known as a \"sex anddeath goddess\", and the goddess of witchcraftand sorcery.The Illuminati symbolism surrounding Diana's murder is, therefore,simplystunning. At the spot where Diana died, the road that goes through thePont deL'Alma Tunnel is crossed on the surface by another, which leads on to thePont deL'Alma Bridge. In fact, this spot is a maze of crossroads. Diana died inthe earlymorning of August 31st. Hecate's Day in the Satanic calendar is August13th, butunder the Satanic law of reverse symbolism and numbers, Hecate's day ofsacrificeis...August 31st!17 Outside the original Paris and now very much insidethe moderncity, the Merovingians established an underground chamber for theworship of thegoddess Diana, and the blood rituals and human sacrifices to her.This site datesback at least to AD500 to 750 and it was here that kings (of thereptilian bloodline) indispute over property would settle the issue in combat.As I mentioned earlier, thelocation today of this sacrificial site to thegoddess Diana/Hecate is...the Pont deL'Alma Tunnel! The word pont relates toPontifex, a Roman high priest, and itmeans passage or bridge. Alma comes fromAl-Mah, a Middle-Eastern name for theMoon Goddess.18 So Pont de L'Almatranslates as \"bridge or passage of the MoonGoddess\" and the adjoining Place deL'Alma is the \"Place of the Moon Goddess\" -and the Moon Goddess isDiana/Hecate/El. The Amazon goddess Cybele, whowas worshipped in Rome at thesame time as Hecate, was also known as Alma. Thereason Diana was held so long inthe tunnel before being moved to hospital fortreatment was that she had to diein that sacrificial site according to the sick ritual,and she was dead beforeshe was moved. Princess Diana was buried in a tree grove,on an island, in alake, all of which are associated with the Goddess Diana in all herversions.Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, also had four black swans introduced to thelakeafter his sister died. Swans are yet more goddess symbolism and Scandinavian178Children of the Matrixmyths claimed that the Valkeries incarnated as swans and wore magicswan-feathercloaks to transform themselves.19 Swan knights and swan maidens werewidelyassociated with the pagan religion. The story of the sacrificial murder ofPrincessDiana by the serpent cult-Illuminati is told in over 60 pages in TheBiggest Secret.Troy, Troy, and Troy againThe events of ancient Troy connect fundamentally with the death of PrincessDianaand so much else besides. The Merovingian bloodline goes back to the TrojanWarand beyond, and it was they who founded the city of Paris and named it aftertheTrojan called Prince Paris, the lover of Helen (El-en) of Troy. According toBarbaraWalker in The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, Helen was saidto be anincarnation of the virgin Moon-goddess and daughter of Hecubaor...Hecate.20Helen was also known as Helle and Selene and was worshipped at aSpartan sexualfestival called the Helenphoria that included sexual symbolscarried in a basketcalled the helene.21 Troy or Troia means \"three places\" inGreek and Hebrew andalmost certainly relates to the triple-goddess symbolism ofAtlantis and Lemuriawith one deity divided into the \"trinity\", or three aspects.Hecate was known as\"Hecate of the Three Ways\".22 Troy or Troia is also theorigin of the name Tripoli, thecapital of Libya, which is so associated with thereptilian Amazons.The legends of Troy say that Helen married the \"Moon-king\" Menelaus, whowaspromised immortality because of this \"sacred marriage\". When Helen went offwithPrince Paris, Menelaus wanted to protect his immortality and the wealththemarriage had secured, and sailed with his army to take her back. This was thewarbetween the male-led Greeks and the goddess-led Trojans. Many highSatanicpriestesses take the name Helen, Helena, or Elaine - EI-aine.* It wasunder thename Elaine or Ellen that Helen of Troy became the symbolic queen ofBritain inpagan times. As 1 outlined earlier, it was a relative of Helen, aTrojan called Brutus,who sailed west to Britain after the fall of Troy andfounded a city called Caer Troiaor New Troy - today's London. Other derivativesof El or Hel are Helenia, Helga,Hild, Helsinki, Holstein, and Holland (Hel-landor Halland), one of the majorcentres for the reptilian bloodlines to this day.Pliny, the Roman writer, said that allthe people of \"Scatinavia\", orScandinavia, were children of \"Mother Hel\" andwere called Helleviones.24 Theybelieved that she lived in elder or Hel-trees/elventrees. Sir Laurence Gardner,of the Royal Dragon Court and Order, saysthat his \"Dragon Bloodlines” have beencalled the Elven Race and that terms likeelf, fairy, and pixie all symbolise the\"representatives of various castes within thekingly succession\" (the reptilianhierarchy).24 So many fairy tales and otherchildren's stories are encoded withthe theme of the dragon bloodlines and theirbattles for power. The tales ofprinces and princesses \"turning into a frog\" issymbolic of shape-shifting. Thesame with dragon princesses locked in towers orgiving birth to frogs.* This is not to say that everyone with these names is involved in this, ofcourse. Only that these arenames the Illuminati use.The Set-serpent cult is SatanismThe Satanists still use the deities, symbols, and rituals today that were usedby theancients because they represent the same stream of control and bloodline.In theUnited States we have the Temple of Set, an offshoot from Anton LaVey'sinfamousChurch of Satan. The Temple of Set was formed in 1975 by Michael Aquino,one ofthe most notorious exponents of the Illuminati's mind control network, asdetailedin my other books. Images of Set and the Set-Wolf symbolism go back atleast to3200BC, the period of the battles between the Nordics and the serpentcult recordedin the Edda (Figure 31). The Temple of Set website tells us:\"The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the last early monuments connected withtheidea of a Setian afterlife as well as a solar one. The Great Pyramid had aspecialair shaft for the king's akh to fly to the star Alpha Draconis, which isthe star of Setin the Constellation of the Thigh (today's 'Big Dipper').\"25Alpha Draconis is the alleged base of the \"Draco\" reptilian \"royalty\". Itwasknown to the Egyptians as Thurban, an Arabic word meaning dragon, andthepyramid builders aligned their structures with Thurban/Alpha Draconis,whichwas the pole star around 3000BC. The Hyksos tribe, who invaded and ruledEgyptfrom around 1785-1580 BC, were Set worshippers and they placed theircapital atAvaris on an ancient site of Set worship. Theyrepresented Set with an ass head.A line ofSet-worshipping priests from Tanis eventuallybecame the royal line ofpharaohs, people likeSeti (\"Set's man\") and Setnakt (\"Set is Mighty\").This wasthe serpent cult.Holle-wood, the land of El-lusionI can't emphasise enough that to understandwhat we call the present we have tounderstandthe past, and this is why the Anunnaki-Illuminati have concentrated somuch effort onrewriting history. Even Hollywood is anexample. The Druids weretree worshippers,especially the oak. The holly was their mostsacred symbolbecause it was sacred to MotherHolle or Hel, the goddess of the underworld.Thuswe have Holle or Holly-wood (Hel-wood),the \"place of magic\" and home of theIlluminati's mass propaganda and conditioningmachine in California. The hollywood was afavourite source of magic wands. The holly or\"holy\" was associatedwith El or Hel's vaginaand the Germanic \"Hohle\" means cave orFigure 31: Thewolf-headed Set in grave.26 The cave is the traditional birthplace ofEgyptianlegend, their version of Balder ^ \"Jesus\"_type deities. The red holly berriesPicture #38 [images/img_0038.png]Picture #39 [images/img_0039.png]180Children of the Matrixsymbolised the female blood, and the white berries symbolised the male semenanddeath. The importance of the holly, or holy tree can be seen in the Christmaspaganhymn sung today by Christians which says that the \"holly bears thecrown\".Interestingly, the official Scottish residence of the British royalfamily is called thePalace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Rood is a name for therowan woodfeatured in the Edda in relation to Thor. The new Scottish Parliamentis also beinghoused in Holyrood Road. High above the Palace of Holyroodhouse, atthe highestpoint in Holyrood Park, is a rock called King Arthur's Seat.\"If you are new to these subjects, I hope that you are beginning to appreciatehowso much of what we call past and present are fundamentally connected, and howthecalling cards of this covert force can be seen everywhere if you take thetime to look.SOURCES1 British Edda2 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 1.0583 British Edda, p 2494 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 6745 Ibid, p 3826 Ibid, p 5497 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, pp 201 and 2028 Trance-Formation Of America, pp 176 and 1789 For Sir Laurence Gardner's information about thissee:http://www.nexusmagazine.com/ringlords1 .html10 British Edda, Introduction11 http://www.nexusmagazine.com/ringlords1 .html12 The Deadly Deception, p 10213 Ibid14 Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p 81915 Details of the explanations that Jim Shaw was given can be found in TheDeadlyDeception, pp 142 to 14616 Ibid, pi 4917 Told to the author by Arizona Wilder, a former \"Mother Goddess\" in IlluminatiSatanicritual18 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 2319 Ibid, pp 963 and 96420 Ibid, pp 382 and 383The many faces of the serpent cult18121 Ibid22 Ibid, p 37823 Ibid, p 38224 http://www.nexusmagazine.com/ringlords1 .html25 http://www.xeper.org/pub/tos26 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 406Picture #40 [images/img_0040.png]The three main varietiesof \"extraterrestrial\"reported in abductionsand otherexperiences.This is one of manytypesof reptilian being andthisimage was painted fromancient and modernPicture #41 [images/img_0041.png]Picture section183The Zulu shaman Credo MutwaPicture #42 [images/img_0042.png]painted the image of this \"Nordic\"extraterrestrial figure, or the \"Mzungu\"asthey are called in African legend.These tall, white, beings could appearanddisappear according to Africanlegends and reports, and they werewidely reportedin Africa long before thewhite Europeans first arrived.

They accept their, often grotesque, plight on the word of men inlongfrocks who tell them it is \"God's plan\". Take the shit today and you'll haveparadisetomorrow. It's always tomorrow.Babylon to RomeThe blueprint for control by religion was honed and polished in Babylon, inthelands of Sumer in Mesopotamia. Babylon is also the location from where theglobalfinancial scam was foisted on the world. This scam involves lending peoplemoneythat doesn't exist and charging interest on it. It just so happens thatBabylonbecame the new headquarters of the Anunnaki bloodlines after the SumerEmpirecollapsed. Their operational centre later moved to Rome and it was thenthat wehad the Roman Empire and the founding of the Roman Church,which,understandably, was a copy of the religion of Babylon. It uses the samemethods,symbols, and stories. It is interesting to note that the word basilica,as in St Peter'sBasilica in Rome, would appear to originate from a term relatingto both a deadlyserpent and royalty. A basilisk was a \"mythical serpent, lizardor dragon, the\"King of Serpents\", whose hissing drove away all other reptiles,and whose glanceand breath were fatal\", according to Norman Lewis in theComprehensive WordGuide (Doubleday, New York, 1958). It was the \"king snake\"that all other reptilesfeared. The American Heritage Dictionary Of The EnglishLanguage, Fourth Edition,2000, reveals that the name basilisk comes from theLatin/Greek terms basiliscus,basiliskos, and basileus, meaning king or \"littleking\". This evolved into the OldFrench word, basilisc. Here we have theconnection between royalty and theserpent yet again. The basilisk is mentionedin Psalm 91, but by the time of theKing James translation, the reference hasbeen changed to an \"adder\". Later thebasilisk became associated with the cockand became interchangeable with theterm \"cockatrice\". St Peter of basilica fameis connected to the cock, as we shall see.194How appropriate should the centrepiece of the headquarters of theBabylonianChurch in Rome be named after a royal serpent.Rome to LondonWhen the Anunnaki bloodlines moved their operational centre to LondonafterWilliam of Orange arrived in 1688, we had the emergence of the BritishEmpire. Infact, the empires of Sumer, Babylon, Rome, and Britain were allcreated andcontrolled by one force. In Babylon they used the same structure theyhad in Sumerwith the priesthood acting as the go-between or middleman for the\"gods\", and thisgave them enormous power over the people. During the Babylonperiod theAnunnaki were seeking to rise from the ashes of Sumer and developtheir strategyfor taking over the world covertly through their bloodlines andfront organisations.To do this, they needed to take out of circulation the trueaccounts of history,especially their own role in humanity's suppression, and theesoteric knowledgethat would allow the people to understand the magnitude oftheir own power andpotential. John A. Keel, in his book Our Haunted Planet saysthat they chose religionas the \"battleground\" on which to conquer the humanmind:\"...The para-human Serpent People of the past are still among us. Theywereprobably worshipped by the builders of Stonehenge and the forgottenridge-makingcultures of South America. ...In some parts of the world the SerpentPeoplesuccessfully posed as gods and imitated the techniques of thesuper-intelligence[God]. This led to the formation of pagan religions centeredon human sacrifices.The conflict, so far as man himself was concerned, becameone of religions andraces. Whole civilizations based upon the worship of thesefalse gods rose and fellin Asia, Africa, and South America.\"...Once an individual had committed himself, he opened a door so thatanindefinable something (probably an undetectable mass of intelligent energy)couldactually enter his body and exercise some control over his suBConsciousmind ...The human race would supply the pawns ...Each individual had toconsciously commithimself to one of the opposing forces ...The main battle wasfor what was to becomeknown as the human soul.\"1By choosing to give yourself to a deity or \"god\", you open your psychetopossession by the force that deity or \"god\" represents. And deities like\"Mary\"and \"Jesus\" represent very different forces to those perceived by their\"believers\".It is so important for people to get out of religion and startrecovering control oftheir own minds. There is an important point to make beforewe proceed becausethe symbolism of the Sun is about to become very significant.There is a generalbelief that the Sun represents the male and the Moon thefemale. That'sunderstandable because that's the way it looks and on one levelit's true. Butthere's a twist. There came a time when the global religion ofworshipping thegoddess was replaced by the male \"god\". However, that was only onthe surface,196Children of the Matrixfor public consumption, control, and ignorance. To suppress theancientknowledge, not least that of true history, it was necessary to destroythe outwardexpression of goddess worship while its initiates continued withbusiness as usual.Therefore, religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islamwere created to give theappearance of being dominated by the male, while, intruth, being secret vehiclesfor the worship of the goddess. This involved takingfemale deities like El anddepicting them as male.The sun goddessWay back in history the Sun was portrayed as female.2 In Japan, a country withalong history of serpent worship, the ruling clans claimed descent from theSunGoddess. Japanese tribes in AD238 were ruled by Queen Himiko, who wascalledthe Daughter of the Sun. The goddess Aditi, the Hindu Great Mother, wasdepictedas the Sun. She was said to be the mother of the Adityas, who wassymbolic of the12 signs of the zodiac. The Sun was the \"garment\" of the goddess,who was\"clothed with the Sun\". When Christians made Mother Mary their version ofthegoddess, they said that Mary was a \"woman clothed in the Sun\". TantricBuddhismhad the goddess as the Sun. The ancient Arabs worshipped the Sun as theGoddessAtthar and referred to her as the \"Torch of the Gods\". The Celts had aSun goddesscalled Sulis, a name that derives from Suil, meaning both \"eye\" and\"Sun\", both ofwhich appear on the dollar bill and the reverse of the Great Sealof the UnitedStates. She was also known as Sul, Sol and Sunna. One of hershrines in Britain isthe biggest human-made mound in Europe called Silbury Hill,which is part of thecomplex of standing stones and earthworks at Avebury inWiltshire, England. Sulwas worshipped from the high places, just as El and herderivatives were associatedwith mountains. Hills overlooking springs were themost sacred places in Britainfor the Goddess Sul, places like Glastonbury Torand Bath. Overlooking Bath, forexample, is Solsbury Hill, and Salisbury inWiltshire is another important Sungoddess site and the location of a famouscathedral much beloved of Prince Charles.When the Romans came to Britain theyworshipped this goddess as Sol Minerva.Her symbol was an owl - the symbol of therituals at Bohemian Grove in northernCalifornia. The road system around theCongress Building in Washington DC is alsoshaped unmistakably as an owl (see TheBiggest Secret). The lion became the symbolof the \"male\" Sun when the openbecame hidden, but once again the lion had morecommonly symbolised the goddess.The Mother Goddess Hathor was depicted as alion-headed Sphinx.Mystery BabylonThe Mystery school/secret society network designed to advance thereptilianagenda expanded rapidly from the time of Babylon after 2000BC. In thissame periodthe Royal Court of the Dragon was infiltrating the Egyptian MysterySchools andthe other structures of power. The Jewish historian, Eupolemus, saidthat giantsbuilt Babylon after the deluge - the usual story. According to aBabylonian text,these giants were the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki priesthood inBabylon began to197invent a whole new history and religious \"truth\", through which they couldcontrolthe people mentally, emotionally, and, as a consequence, physically. Indoing so,they replaced spiritual truths with fairy tales about mythical people,which themasses were told to take literally At this point, they were stillreferring to \"gods\"plural because the Illuminati's manipulation had not yet reached the stagewherethe Anunnaki and other gods could be transformed into one \"god\". Whenthatchange came it would eliminate the more obvious records of their existence.TheHebrew priesthood would achieve this, together with the English translatorsof theBible. The religion of Babylon created the mould, even the detailedstories, for thosethat followed. For example, where have you heard this before?In Babylon theyworshipped a trinity of Nimrod, the father, symbolised as a fish;Tammuz or Ninus,the son, who was said to have died to save humanity on December25th; and QueenSemiramis, the Babylonian \"Isis\", who was symbolised as a dove.They said thatNimrod and Tammuz, the father and son, were \"one\". When Tammuzdied for thesins of humanity, the priesthood said he was put in a tomb and,three days laterwhen they rolled back the stone, he was gone. All this was thousands of yearsbefore Christianity and it is just one of so many versions of the \"Jesus\" storythatwere told long before \"Jesus\" was supposed to have lived. Oh yes, in the springrituals to mark the death and resurrection of Tammuz/Ninus, they offered bunsinscribed with a solar cross - the hot cross buns of the much later\"Christian\"festival called Easter. Christianity is just recycled \"paganism\" thatcondemns\"pagans\" as evil. What hypocrisy. Even the term \"Testament\" is theentomologicalconfirmation that it is literally all a load of balls. LaurenSavage, the Webmaster atdavidicke.com and a long-time researcher of ancienthistory, tells me that the root ofTestament is \"testes\". Apparently, traditionsays that the ancient Hebrews used tohold the other guy's balls, sorry \"testes\",while hearing an oath. Funnily enough,they do the same in some of the Illuminatirituals today, I am told. Lauren says thatin the King James Version of theBible, Abraham has his servant swear upon his\"thigh\" according to thetranslation when, in Hebrew tradition, it would have beenhis dangly bits. Itcertainly gives new meaning to the term; \"Got you by the balls\".Staring at a penis was another way to \"God\" in these times, I understand, and insome way this related to \"remembering\" the covenant. All it does for me ismakeme remember that I am not as young as I used to be. So the Old Testamentmeans\"Old Balls\" and the New Testament means \"New Balls\". When we testify incourtis the judge symbolically holding our testicles? You're right, don't letsgo there.Good thinking.Suns of godTammuz was a name for the Sumerian god Dumazi or Damu (the \"only begottenson\" or\"Son of the Blood\") who provided the blueprint for all the later sons ofGod,including Jesus. The Hebrews inherited Tammuz (also known as Adonis) fromtheBabylonians and the Roman records refer to Tammuz as the chief god of theJews.The Jewish calendar still has a month named after Tammuz, who was knownas\"the serpent who emanated from the heaven-god, Anu.\"3 And Anu was the head of198Children of the Matrixthe Anunnaki, the Sumerian tablets say. The Mesopotamian kings were said to beofthe bloodline of Tammuz, just as Sir Laurence Gardner claims that theMerovingian\"true\" royal line is the bloodline of Jesus. It was said that theland was given life bythe blood of Tammuz and he was a healer, saviour, and ashepherd who lookedafter his flock of stars. He died wearing a \"crown of thorns\"made from myrrh.Tammuz was symbolically sacrificed on the Day of Atonement inthe form of alamb. He was worshipped in Jerusalem where his exact story wouldlater be re-toldusing the name \"Jesus\". And, take a deep breath here vicar, thecave in Bethlehemwhere Jesus is said to have been born, is the same one wherethe ancients claimedthat Tammuz (Adonis) was born. The Bible \"translator\",Jerome, admitted thatBethlehem had been a sacred grove dedicated to Tammuz, thefertility god or \"spiritof the corn\". Bethlehem means \"House of Bread\" or \"Houseof Corn\". Horns, theEgyptian Son of God, was born in the \"Place of Bread” andJesus said he was \"theBread of Life”.The priesthood took the ancient Sumer Sun religion, esoteric, astrologicalandastronomical knowledge, and the stories of their reptilian gods, and buriedthem insymbolic fables. This hid their real meaning, except to initiates, whileintroducing therigid beliefs of the prison religions. Every major religion,Judaism, Christianity,Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism all had the same basicorigin: the knowledge andbeliefs of Sumer, which inherited the knowledge andbeliefs of Atlantis and Lemuria.The major religions were all founded in thelands once occupied by the SumerEmpire. They may have emphasised differentelements of the Sumer beliefs, but thatwas the mould from which they all came.The priesthood's job was to withdraw thetrue knowledge from circulation and theytwisted their manufactured religious textsuntil the knowledge that would set thepeople free was portrayed as \"evil”. Look atChristianity. Another goal of thepriesthood, or the \"Long Frocks\" as I call them, wasto develop stories andthemes that made the people feel powerless, insignificant, andin awe of inventedreligious deities. By being the \"middlemen\" to the gods (later\"God\") andinterpreters of the \"law\" laid down by these make-believe \"deities\",they couldcontrol the people for their masters, the reptilian and other demonicentities.To stop the people rebelling against this suppression, control, and poverty,thepriesthood stories had to promise a paradise in the afterlife for all thosewhoobeyed \"God's law\". In other words, their law, the law of the Anunnaki. Andforthose who did not obey this \"law\"? Eternal hell and damnation. Even the term\"sin\",as I have pointed out, comes from the name of an Anunnaki \"god\".Out of Babylon (1): JudaismThe texts that formed the Old Testament of the Bible, a foundation of JudaismandChristianity, were written after the Levite priesthood of the Hebrews wereheld incaptivity after 586BC in...here we go...Babylon! I think the term\"captivity\" is lessthan appropriate, also. The early Hebrews worshipped theserpent god of theSumer Empire and the Levites were called \"Sons of the GreatSerpent\". Their godYHVH was depicted as part human, part serpent, and theirsacred book of esoteric(hidden) knowledge, the Kabbala, means \"Serpent Wisdom\".5The Levites or Sonsof the Great Serpent (bloodline) worshipped YHVH as a dragon calledLeviathan,hence Levite.6 YHVH's serpent form was also known as Nehushtan or\"BrazenSerpent\" by the Levites and they placed golden and brass images of thisdeity onthe altars of Hebrew temples.7 Excavations have discovered bronze andcopperserpent symbols in former Levite temples. The mythical story of Moses andtheBrazen Serpent set upon a cross is symbolic of this same theme. TheBabylonianshad inherited the stories and myths of Egypt and Sumer, and now theywouldreappear in a twisted form in the texts that would later become the OldTestament.Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, which togethermake upthe \"Jewish\" Torah, were all written by the Levites, or under theirsupervision,during or after the captivity in Babylon when the Levites joinedforces with thenetwork of the Babylonian reptilian priesthood. So you find theSumerian story ofKing Sargon floating on the river in a basket of rushesrehashed by the Levites inthe account of the mythical character called \"Moses\".And the Sumerian Edin, the\"abode of the gods\", became the Garden of Eden in theLevite tales. The Book ofGenesis is an edited version of the Sumerian accountsand it is a mass of goddesssymbolism. The \"mana from heaven\", which theMoses-led Israelites weresupposed to have received from \"God\" or YHVH/Jehovah,is actually a name forthe goddess, Mana, who, like El, ruled the underworld.8The Romans knew her asMana or Mania. Her ancestral spirits were called \"manes\",as in the mane of thelion, so associated with the serpent cult, and of thehorse, so connected with theAmazons or Valkeries. From the names Mana and Maniawe get the word todescribe crazed behaviour. This is derived from worship of theMoon goddess, as inMoon-madness or \"lunacy\". Mantra, the Sanskrit term forprojecting vibrations bychanting words or sounds, comes from the same root. Manuwas the name for theIndian version of Noah, who survived the deluge with thehelp of the Great SerpentVasuki.\" In earlier times Manu was the womb of thegoddess.The Levites, those Babylonian Mystery School initiates, invented anentirehistory for the Hebrews to hide the real story and create a fiercelyimposedstructure of religious control. The Rabbis continue that tradition tothis day. There isfar more about this story in The Biggest Secret, where I havehighlighted the waythese texts were coded with esoteric knowledge and why thevast majority ofpeople who we call \"Jewish\" today have no genetic connection toPalestine orIsrael. They originate, as Jewish sources have confirmed, from theKhazars, a peoplefrom southern Russia and the Caucasus Mountains, who had a massconversion toJudaism in the 8th century. The terms \"Jewish\" and \"Hebrew\" havebecome mixedup. Some people we call Jewish go back to the Hebrews of the MiddleEast, butmost do not. They come from the Caucasus. It shouldn't matter wherethey comefrom, its just a body, but if people are being told a fib they have aright to know. Somuch of the \"Hebrew\" knowledge also came from the EgyptianMystery schoolsand this is where the Hebrew language originated. The classic\"Hebrew\" or\"Jewish\" name, Cohen, comes from Cahen, the Egyptian name for priestand prince,and there are fundamental connections between the Hebrews and bothEgypt andBabylon. After all, the people who became known as the Hebrews camefrom200Children of the Matrixwithin the same Sumer Empire that included the lands we now call IsraelorPalestine. They were just an expression of the same empire and doubtlessthepriesthood of the Sumerians, Egyptians, Hebrews, Sumerians, andBabylonians,were connected by the same brotherhood networks going back toAtlantis andLemuria. The Sumerian priesthood were the middlemen between thepeople andthe reptilian \"gods\" and so, in the end, were the others. The inventedstory of the\"Exodus\" was written to obscure the truth of what really happened inEgypt andthere is no historical record outside of the Levite texts, nor anyarchaeologicalevidence, that any such \"Exodus\" ever took place. Between 1967 and1982 when theIsraelis occupied the Sinai Desert, they instigated a massivesearch for evidence ofthe 40 years the \"Israelites\" were supposed to have livedthere. What did they find?Nothing. The loss of the Egyptian army in the Red Seais not recorded in anyhistorical document and this is utterly ludicrous if ithad actually happened. TheGreek historian Herodotus (C.485-425BC) travelled andresearched the lands andhistory of Egypt and the Near East and yet he heardnothing of King Solomon, themass exodus of \"Israelites\" from Egypt, or theEgyptian army drowned in the RedSea. Neither did the Greek philosopher, Plato.L.A. Waddell, a fluent reader ofSanskrit, Sumerian, and Egyptian, researchedthat whole region in great detail.He concluded:\"There is absolutely no inscriptional evidence whatsoever, nor any ancient GreekorRoman reference, for the existence of Abraham or any of the Jewish patriarchs orprophets of the Old Testament, nor for Moses, Saul, David, Solomon, nor any oftheJewish kings, with the mere exception of two, or at most three, of the laterkings.\"10Nor was there any claim for the existence of any of these people until theLeviteswere taken to Babylon where the plot was hatched. The same stories thatwere toldabout Abraham, like the near-sacrifice of his son, can be found inIndia. Earlierversions of \"Moses\" appear all over the Near and Middle East andtheMediterranean region under different names. In Babylon they said that Godgave\"Nemo the Lawgiver\" the tablets of the law on a mountaintop. After theLevites leftBabylon, they turned Nemo into \"Moses\". In Syria, they had a guythey called\"Mises\", who did all the things the Levites attributed to \"Moses\".Like theSumerian King Sargon, \"Mises\" was found as a baby floating in a basket of reedsorrushes. Mises went on to part the waters with his magical rod and he wastheguardian of the law, written in stone. Another \"Moses\" was the Egyptian hero,Ra-Haraldhti, whose alleged life was also copied by the forgers of history.” The\"TenCommandments\", so associated with Moses, are a copy of the laws known astheCode of Hammurabi. These were written at least a thousand years earlier. Ofcoursethey were, the Code of Hammurabi came from...Babylon! But this code ofHammurabi goes back even further to our old friend Indara/Thor/St George, thefirst king of Sumer and his \"Ten Commandments\" of some 5,000 years ago.Thesewere called in the Edda the \"Hug Runes\" with the word \"hug\" meaningaffection,love, and good heart. Hence hugging.201The real Bible codeAnother fact that is vital to understand if we are to see the forest for thetrees is thatthese Levite texts were written symbolically in codes and parables.When we takethem all literally we lose the plot. Before the prison religions,the ancients wereworshippers of the Sun and all three syllables in Sol-om-on aredifferent names forthe Sun. King Solomon's Temple was not a real location, it issymbolic. TheFreemasonic historian. Manly P. Hall, wrote that King Solomon's1,000 \"wives\" andconcubines were symbolic of the Sun, moons, asteroids, andother \"receptivebodies\", within his \"house\" or \"temple\" - the solar system.12The stories attributedto Solomon and David can be found long before in India.And if there was no Davidor Solomon, then how can they have provided thebloodline of \"Jesus\"? Answer:they didn't. That genealogy was invented to serve apurpose, as were the OldTestament genealogies back to \"Abraham\" in Sumer. Theywere part of themanufactured history, some truth mixed with endless lies anddeceit, which wascreated to hide what really happened. Edouard Dujardin, in hisbook, AncientHistory Of The God Jesus (Watts and Co, 1938) documents how Judaismor the\"Jahvehists\" took the gods of other nations and turned them into mythicalHebrewleaders, heroes, and prophets:\"Where Judaism fully succeeded, the ancient Baals of Palestine weretransformedinto heroic servants of Jahveh; where it gained only a partialvictory, they becamesecondary gods ...Many of the old Baals of Palestine wereassimilated by Judaism,which converted them into heroes in the cause of Jahveh,and in fact many scholarsagree that the patriarchs of the Bible are the ancientgods of Palestine.\"13The Hebrew gods, er, sorry...GodThe idea that the Hebrew religion was based on \"one God\" is outrageousnonsense.They worshipped many gods and in the Old Testament texts they referagain andagain to god in the plural, as with Elohim. The Jewish singular \"god\",El, comesfrom the name Elohim, which is plural. The Elohim were the Anunnaki,and theserpent goddess, El, in the Edda relates to all this. But in the Englishtranslations theplural gods are turned into the singular God. The first line ofGenesis \"In theBeginning God created the heaven and the Earth\" actually reads inthe Hebrew: \"Inthe beginning the gods created the heavens and the Earth.” Theword Elohim,plural, is used 30 times in Genesis and 2,570 times in all.14 Theseinclude the terms:\"And the elohim said let us make men in our image\"; the elohimsaid \"come let usgo down\" in the story of the Tower of Babel; and \"Behold, theman has become likeone of us, to know good and evil\" in the Garden of Eden. Alsoin Genesis we have:\"And elohim said, 'Let us make Adam'\".15 Terms likeYahveh-elohim or Yahveh ofthe gods, is translated as Lord and Lord God to hidethe truth. It was impossible toeliminate \"the gods\" when these texts were firstwritten because the whole of theworld was worshipping a vast range of gods,representing the Anunnaki and othersunder different names, and the Sun, Moon,planets, stars, and natural forces. The202Children of the Matrixmove from gods to God advanced rapidly with the advent of the Illuminatireligionof Christianity and when the Bible was translated into English. The KingJamesVersion of the Bible, the most used translation of them all, was sponsoredby KingJames 1st, the first king of England and Scotland, who took the jointthrone after thedeath of Elizabeth 1st in 1603. Even most of the \"new\" Biblesare only updates of theKing James Version. The \"King James” removed a lot ofmarginal notes included inits predecessor, the so-called Geneva Bible, publishedin 1560. The king wanted torevise the Bible text because, like his mother, MaryStuart, he believed totally in the\"divine right of kings\" in which the monarchanswered to no one except \"God\" (thegods). The Geneva Bible included phrases hedid not like in relation to this \"divineright” and so he had them removed. Jameswas a Satanist and reptilian bloodlinegoing back to the Egyptian pharaohs. Hissexual desires preferred young boys, asrecorded in numerous books and publicrecords, and his lust for blood appearedinsatiable. When he killed an animal hewould literally roll in its blood, and he wasresponsible for the death andtorture of thousands of \"witches\". He suggestedmany of the tortures himself.16This is the man who decided what the Bible does ordoes not say! 1 am sure thatthe mass slaughter of \"witches\" by King James and theChristian church isconnected with destroying certain bloodlines passed on throughthe female DNA.Sir Francis Bacon oversaw the translation of the King James Bible.He was fromthe reptilian bloodline and a high initiate of the secret society networkasGrand Master of the Rosicrucian Order. He was a Knights Templar, aninspirationbehind the creation of Freemasonry and the Royal Society, and a keymember of theteam of initiates under Lord Draconis, Edward de Vere, whichcompiled the\"Shakespeare\" plays.Out of Babylon (2): ChristianityThe Old Testament was joined by the \"New\" with the founding of Christianity,areligion that was based on the same Levite fables. In fact, there was no\"NewTestament\" until the 4th century AD. That's a long time for the texts tobeformulated for a religion that supposed to have been started 300 yearsearlier. Andwho arranged for all this? The Roman Emperor Constantine the \"Great\"afterAD325. He was the official head of a Roman Empire controlled by the verysameforces that had earlier controlled Babylon when the texts of the OldTestamentstarted to be written. Just a coincidence, eh? Vendyl \"Indiana\" Jones,the director ofthe Institute for Judeo-Christian Research in Arlington, Texas,points out that\"primal Christians\" had only the Hebrew Torah, the first 5 booksof \"Moses\", the22 books of the Prophets and Holy Writings that included Psalms,Proverbs, Job,Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel,Ezra-Nehemiah,and the two books of Chronicles; plus the 14 books of theApocrypha. There wasnothing about \"Jesus\". They met and worshipped with theHebrews in theSynagogues and had no \"Testament\" of their own. Jones stressesthat when we seeterms in the New Testament like: \"...the scripture saith...it iswritten...what saiththe law...thus saith the Lord...or...as the prophet said...\"they are referring to OldTestament writings. The first \"Christians\" based theirfaith on the texts of theGod save us from religionLevites, just as they still do today. As Vendyl Jones says, the writers of whathecalls the \"Newer Testament\" viewed the Older Testament of the HebrewScripturesas the supreme authority:\"Much later their writings became the Newer Testament. Their authority was intheTorah primarily. This was enforced by the Prophets and Holy Writings. TheirNewerTestament writings never showed or claimed supremacy over the OlderTestament!They did all their writing in the Jewish mind-set. This attitudealways concedesall authority to the Torah! It never irritates or challenges theauthority of theHebrew Scriptures.\"17The big \"C\" is a big liePicture #70 [images/img_0070.png]Christianity was just an \"add-on\" to the texts and laws decided by the Levitesandtheir successors during and after the Babylon \"captivity\". So what isChristianity andwhere did it come from? If you are a Christian, I should sitdown and strap in.Christianity is largely a Sun religion and \"Jesus\" is not the\"son\", but the Sun. Or atleast that is part of his symbolism. We have alreadyseen the similarities between\"Jesus\" and Balder of the serpent cult also, of course. The ancient Sun religionofBurner, and throughout the ancient world, was written down as a symbolicstory,which Christians have been told to take literally. I hope you are readyfor this, vicar.The main form of communication in the ancient world wassymbolism and parable,and to understand the ancient Sun symbolism is tounderstand the major religions.They used the symbol in Figure 32 tosymbolise the Sun's journey throughthe year,or, more accurately, the Earth'sjourney in relation to the Sun. This isthe so-called Sun cross. It can be foundthroughout the ancient world. Theydrew acircle and a zodiac (a Greekword meaning animal circle) andadded a cross to markthe four seasons,and the solstice and equinox points. Atthe centre of the cross they placedtheSun and this is where the theme of theSun, or symbolically the \"son\", onthecross originates. A similar symbol wasused in Lemuria relating,JamesChurchward says, to the primal forcesof creation. A long list of pre-\"Jesus\"Figure 32: The cross and the circle thatsymbolised were given ^ the birthday ofthe solar year. The point of the cross to the right isthe winter solstice when the Sun was said to have December ^Ath because of thisSunsymbolically died- Three days later, on December symbolism. The winter solstice,the25th. the Sun was said to be born or born again lowest point or the Sun's powerin the204Children of the Matrixnorthern hemisphere, is on December 21st/22nd. This was the time whentheancients said that the Sun had \"died\" and gone down into the dark place.ByDecember 25th, three days later, they said the Sun had begun its journey backto thepeak of its power in the summer and so they said that on this day the Sunwas bornor born again. The ancient Sun gods were given this \"birthday\", threedays after thewinter solstice, for this reason. These deities didn't exist, aseveryone now accepts.They were symbolic of the Sun and so was Jesus, along withmuch other symbolism.The Christian \"Christmas\" is an ancient pagan festival under another name andsois Easter. On March 25th, the old date for Easter, the Sun enters theastrologicalsign of Aries, the ram or the lamb, and they sacrificed lambs intheir rituals at thistime to appease the gods and ensure a bumper harvest. Putanother way, theybelieved the blood of the lamb would encourage the gods toforgive their sins. Thestory of Samson (Sam-sun) in the Old Testament is thesame Sun symbolism. Theancients symbolised the Sun's annual cycle as the life ofa man. They would portraythe Sun as a newborn baby on December 25th and he wouldgrow up to become abig, strapping, very strong man at the summer solstice. Thisis the peak of the Sun'spower in the northern hemisphere when it dominates thedarkness at the longestday. At this time, the Sun-man would be given long goldenhair to symbolise thepowerful rays of the summer Sun. As the Sun entered thehouse of Virgo the Virgin(the house of Delilah) at the start of autumn, thisSun-man would have his hair cutshorter as the power of the Sun began to fade.This is the real story of Samson. Hewas not a real person, but symbolic of theSun. Samson, like Jesus, St Paul, andmany other biblical characters, was said tobe a Nazarene or Nazarite. Here we havethe true meaning of the term \"Jesus ofNazareth\" or \"Jesus the Nazarene\". Thetown of Nazareth did not exist during thealleged life of Jesus. There is no mentionof it in any records or on any maps,even though detailed Roman records were keptat that time. It was founded afterthe Gospel stories were circulating. The Nazaritesect banned the cutting ofhair, except in certain solar rituals, because the hairrepresented the rays ofthe sun. This could be the real origin of this custom that stillcontinues todayin the Sikh religion. The Nazarenes or Nazarites wore black, as didtheBabylonian brotherhood, and this was inherited by the Christian church. TodaytheArabic word for Christians is Nasrani and in the Muslim Koran they are theNasaraor Nazara. This comes from the Hebrew word, Nozrim, which derived fromthe term,Nozrei ha-Brit or Keepers of the Covenant. The Anunnaki covenant,it seems to me.Christianity was created by rehashing the ancient symbolic story of theSun,together with Mystery school allegory and serpent cult symbolism presentedas aliteral story in an historical context. The elite priesthood and otherinitiates knewwhat the story really meant, and still do, but they tell thepeople it is literally trueand damnation will befall them if they don't believeit. Some 1,200 years before\"Jesus\", the following was said in the East of the\"heathen saviour\", (Virishna): hewas born to a virgin by Immaculate Conceptionthrough the intervention of a HolySpirit. This fulfilled an ancient prophecy.When he was born, the ruling tyrantwanted to kill him. And his parents had toflee to safety. All male children underthe age of two were slain by the ruler as he sought to kill the child. Angelsandshepherds were at his birth and he was given gifts of gold, frankincense, andmyrrh.He was worshipped as the saviour of men and led a moral and humble life.Heperformed miracles, which included healing the sick, giving sight to theblind,casting out devils, and raising the dead. He was put to death on the crossbetweentwo thieves. He descended to hell and rose from the dead to ascend backto heaven.Just a coincidence. Archbishop? Well how about these, then? They allpre-date\"Jesus\", often by thousands of years.• Attis, the Son of God of PhrygiaHe was born on December 25th to a virgin mother. He was called a \"saviour\",theonly begotten son, and died to save humanity. He was crucified on a Friday-\"Black Friday\" - and his blood was spilled to redeem the Earth. Hesuffereddeath \"with nails and stakes\". He was the Father and Son combined inanearthly body. He was put in a tomb, went down into the underworld, butthreedays later, on March 25th, his body was found to have disappeared fromthetomb and he was resurrected as the \"Most High God\". His body was symbolisedasbread and eaten by those who worshipped him.• Krishna (Christ), the Son of God of IndiaHe was born to a virgin mother on December 25th and his father was acarpenter. Astar marked his birthplace, and angels and shepherds attended. Therulerslaughtered thousands of infants in an effort to kill him, but he survivedandwent on to perform miracles and heal the sick, including lepers, the blind,andthe deaf. He died at about the age of 30 and some traditions say he wascrucifiedon a tree. He was also portrayed on a cross, rose from the dead, andwasconsidered the saviour. His followers apparently knew him as \"Jezeus\"or\"Jeseus\", which means \"pme essence\". It is said that he will return on awhitehorse to judge the dead and fight the \"Prince of Evil\".• Dionysus or Bacchus, the Son of God of GreeceHe was born to a virgin mother on December 25th and put in a manger andswaddlingclothes. He was a teacher who travelled, performing miracles. Heturned waterinto wine (like the Sun) and rode in triumph on an ass (so did theEgyptiandeity. Set). He was the ram or the lamb, God of the Vine, God of Godsand King ofKings, Only Begotten Son, bearer of sins. Redeemer, Anointed One(Christos),Alpha and Omega. He was hung and crucified on a tree, but rosefrom the dead onMarch 25th. During the 1st century BC, the Hebrews inJerusalem also worshippedthis deity. J.M. Roberts writes in Antiquity Unveiled(Health Research, 1970)that \"IES, the Phoenician name for Bacchus, offers theorigin to Jesus\". He saysIES can be broken up into \"I\" (the one) and \"es\" (fireand light). Taken as oneword, \"ies\" means the one light. He goes on: \"This isnone other than the lightof St John's gospel; and this name is to be foundeverywhere on Christian altars,both protestant and catholic, thus clearly206Children of th€ Matrixshowing that the Christian religion is but a modification of Oriental SunWorship, attributed to Zoroaster. The Christians read the same letters 'IHS' intheGreek text as 'Jes' and the Roman Christian priesthood added the terminus 'us'.”Here are some of the other pre-Christian deities of whom the \"Jesus\" storywastold: Apollo, Hercules, and Zeus of Greece; Adad and Marduk of Assyria;BuddhaSakia and Indra of India and Tibet; Salivahana of southern India andBermuda;Osiris and Horus of Egypt; Odin, Balder, and Frey of Scandinavia; Criteof Chaldea;Zoroaster of Persia; Baal (Bel) and Taut of Phoenicia; Bali ofAfghanistan; Jao ofNepal; Wittoba of Bilingonese; Xamolxis of Thrace; Zoar ofthe Bonzes; ChuChulainn of Ireland; Deva Tat, Codom, and Sammonocadam of Siam;Alcides ofThebes; Mikado of the Sintoos; Beddru of Japan; Hesus or Eros, andBremrillahamof the Druids; Thor, son of Odin, of Gauls; Cadmus of Greece; Hiland Feta ofMandaites; Gentaut and Quetzalcoatl of Mexico; Universal Monarch ofthe Sibyls;Ischy of Formosa; Divine Teacher of Plato; Holy One of Xaca; Fohi,Ieo, Fao-Kium,Chiang-Ti, and Tien of China; Ixion and Quirnus of Rome;Prometheus of theCaucasus; Mohammed or Mahomet of Arabia, Dahzbog of the Slavs;Jupiter, Jove,and Quirinius of Rome; Mithra of Persia, India, and Rome.lxThe cult of Mithra originates thousands of years before \"Jesus\" and yet againtellsthe later Christian story in fine detail. It is even said that gold,frankincense, andmyrrh, were offered to him. By the time that Jesus was inventedby the Anunnakipriesthood, the Mithra rites and religion were widespreadthroughout the RomanEmpire. When they founded Christianity in Rome, they usedthe symbols and mythsof the Mithric rituals. Mithra's sacred day was Sundaybecause he was, like Jesus,symbolic of the Sun. Mithra worshippers called thisthe \"Ford's Day\" and theycelebrated the main Mithra festival during what is nowEaster. Mithra initiationswere held in caves adorned with the signs of Capricornand Cancer, symbolic of thewinter and summer solstices. He was portrayed as awinged Eion (the Sun) standingwithin a spiralling serpent. The lion and theserpent are, of course, major symbols ofthe serpent cult/Illuminati. The RomanChurch encompassed the Mithra Eucharistinto its \"Christian\" rituals. Mithra wasclaimed to have said: \"He who shall not eat ofmy body nor drink of my blood, sothat he may be one with me and I with him, shallnot be saved.” The very site onwhich the Vatican was built was a sacred place ofMithra worship. It still is.They just call him Jesus. As I have written before, the cultof Mithra simplybecame the cult of Myth-ra - Christianity.Mithra was a symbol for the Sun and so was his Christian version. Jesus wastheLight of the World (the Sun); he will come back on the clouds and everyoneshall seehim (the Sun). Jesus walks on water (the Sun's reflection does that);Jesus performedhis Father's work in the temple at the age of 12 and started hisministry at 30. TheSun reaches it's daily peak at 12 noon when the ancients,like the Egyptians, said thatthe Sun was the \"Most High God\". The Sun enterseach sign of the zodiac at 30degrees, hence he starts his \"ministry\" at 30.Jesus is claimed to have turned waterinto wine because that is what the Sun doesby making the grapes grow. There ismuch zodiac symbolism in the Bible, as withthe two fishes (Pisces) and the 12baskets (zodiac signs) into which Jesus places his multiplied loaves duringthe\"feeding of the 5,000\". Jesus was the \"fish\" and \"fisher of men\" perhapsbecause theEarth was entering the sign of Pisces the fish at the time he wassupposed to havelived. But there is so much \"fish\" symbolism with regard tothese solar deitiesthroughout history that we cannot ignore a symbolicconnection with the tales of fishgods and amphibious beings - the Nommo orAnnedoti. etc. of Sirius. Remember,too. that the Dogon recount the story thatthe amphibious Nommo said that one ofthem would be crucified. The translation ofthe end of the world comes from theGreek \"aeon\" and refers to the end of the\"age\" and not the \"world”. The end of theage is the end of the 2,160-year cycle,during which the Earth passes through anastrological sign. Today we are nearingthe end of another age, as we leave Piscesand enter Aquarius. Here are some moreof the \"Jesus\" myths decoded.Jesus, the historical characterOutside of the New Testament texts there is no sign or record of Jesuswhatsoever.A mention in the works of the \"Hebrew\" historian Josephus is anobvious lateraddition in the priesthood's desperation to cross-reference theirmeal ticket. Morethan 40 writers are known to have chronicled the events inIsrael/Palestine at thealleged time of \"Jesus\" and not one of them mentions him.The writer Philo livedthroughout the \"life\" of Jesus and wrote a history of theJudeans, which coveredthis whole period. Philo lived in or near Jerusalem at thetime that Jesus wassupposed to have been born to a virgin mother, made histriumphant entry intoJerusalem on a donkey, and was crucified and rose again. Inthis same period,King Herod is also claimed to have killed all those childrentrying to eliminate the\"saviour\". What does Philo say about these amazingevents? Nothing, zilch, thebig round circle. It is the same with the Romanrecords and the work of everycontemporary author. There is a simple explanationfor this. These events neverhappened because there was no \"Jesus\".Jesus the \"Christ\"The word \"Christ\" comes from the Greek \"Christos\", which simply means\"anointed\".The anointing was performed with the fat of a crocodile, menstrualblood, andgoodness knows what else. The term was used for any Israelite king orpriest andcould be applied to anyone who has been anointed. The BabylonianTammuz wascalled the Christos or sacred king and the same or similar terms wereapplied tomany of these pre-Christian \"Jesus\" figures. The name \"Jesus\" is alsoa Greektranslation and if he did exist, which he didn't, his name was certainlynotJesus.Jesus was born to a virginThe virgin mother of the Sun God is an ancient theme found all over the world.Thiscould relate to the solar myth that the Sun was \"born\" in a new or virginMoon andat certain times the constellation of Virgo rose with the Sun. It isalso far fromimpossible that the artificial impregnation of women by the \"gods\"may have been208Children of the Matrixan ancient origin to this concept, too. So many \"heroes\" like MeroveeandAlexander the Great were said to be the result of their mothers beingimpregnatedby a non-human entity and not by intercourse with their husbands.Albert Pike, anotorious Illuminati operative in the United States, wrote in TheMorals And DogmaOf Scottish Rite Freemasonry (L.H. Jenkins, 1928) of theEgyptian myth from whichthe Christian themes originated:\"At the moment of the winter solstice, the virgin rose (with the Sun), havingthe Sun(symbolised as Horus) in her bosom ...Virgo was Isis (virgin mother ofHorus) and herrepresentation, carrying a child (Horus) in her arms, exhibited inher temple, wasaccompanied by this inscription: I am all that is, that was, andthat shall be; and thefruit which I brought forth in the Sun.\"19Writer Gerald Massey reveals that on the walls of the Holy of Holies intheTemple of Luxor, Egypt, are portrayed scenes that are mirrors of the farlater Jesusstory. The god, That, the Annunciator of the gods, can be seenhailing the virgin andtelling her she is going to give birth to the coming son.Another scene depicts thegod, Knept, impregnating the virgin with the Holy Ghostor Spirit for theimmaculate conception. Then the child is seen enthroned andreceiving gifts fromthree spirits (the three wise men in Christianity) and he isadored as the incarnationof the Sun God. Even the story about Jesus being bornin a manger comes fromancient Egypt, as Massey explains:\"The birthplace of the Egyptian messiah at the Vernal Equinox was figured inApt, orApta, the corner; but Apta is also the name of the crib and the manger;hence thechild born in Apta was said to have been born in a manger; and thisApta or crib ormanager is the hieroglyphic sign of the Solar birthplace. Hencethe Egyptiansexhibited the babe in the crib or manager in the streets ofAlexandria.\"20The bright star and the three wise menA bright star marked the birthplace of Jesus, the Bible says. This is the samestorytold in Egypt about Sirius, the brightest star we can see from Earth. TheEgyptianssaid that the rising of the three stars of Orion's belt (the three\"kings\", \"wise men\"or \"Magi\"?) marked the arrival of Sothis or Sirius, the starof Osiris and Horus.Further symbolism of the \"three wise men\" is that the Magiwere Sun worshippers.Gold, frankincense, and myrrh were the traditional giftsgiven by Arabian Magi tothe Sun and that's why they were given to Mithra in thatversion of the myth.21 Thebirth of Jesus in a stable or cave is repeatedthroughout the solar-myth storiesbecause the cave represents the \"dark place\"where the Sun is said to go betweenthe winter solstice and midnight on December24th. Thus we have the three days inthe tomb between the \"crucifixion\" of Jesus(the Sun) and his \"resurrection\" orrebirth on December 25th. The cave may haveother symbolism, too, however,because the Jesus story can be read on differentesoteric levels at the same time.Tempted in the wilderness for 40 daysThis is another common theme for the solar gods. Author and researcherAlbertChurchward says the Egyptians estimated that it took 40 days after grainwas sownbefore it appeared through the soil. This was a period of fasting andscarcity, hesays, and so Jesus is depicted fasting in the wilderness and \"Satan\"challenges himto turn stones into bread. The battles between light and dark, andwhen Jesusdefeated the darkness, is symbolic of the time in the Sun's cycle whenthere is morelight every day than dark. The 40 years the \"Israelites\" weresupposed to havespent in the desert was similar \"grain\" symbolism turned into amanufactured\"historical\" text.22The words of JesusThe words attributed to Jesus are quotes from earlier \"saviours\" and deities.Horusdelivered a Sermon on the Mount in Egyptian myth and the Jesus version issimplysayings from earlier texts, like the Books Of Enoch, weaved together intoanarrative. Several of the Jesus parables came directly from Buddhism andJainism.The \"Lord's Prayer\" derives from sayings in the Jewish Talmud and mucholderEgyptian prayers to Osiris\" and earlier it was a prayer to the goddess, thegiver ofbread or the \"Grain Mother.24The MarysMary is an ancient name for the goddess that miraculously gives birth tothesaviour Sun God. Its forms include Mari, Meri, Marratu, Marah and Mariham.Onone level, these names relate to the sea, Mer or Mar, and \"Mary\" representsthefeminine, the Moon, the \"Queen of Heaven\", to balance the masculine Sun. Buttheyalso relate to the Dragon Queens. Isis, the Egyptian Moon goddess andvirginmother of Homs, was known as Mother Mary or \"Mata-Meri\" and calledthe\"Queen of Heaven\", \"Our Lady\", and \"Mother of God\".25 El in the Edda textswasalso known as Mary. The Hebrews worshipped a god and goddess deitycalledMari-EL or \"Mary-God\", and the \"Mother Mary\" of Christianity is justanothername for the ancient goddess known as El, Isis, Ishtar, Barati, Artemis,and Diana.The Christian religion, like its bed-mate Judaism, sought to removethe feminineprinciple from the public domain, and the ancient trinity ofFather-Son-Motherbecame Father-Son-Holy Ghost. The grotesque suppression ofwomen wouldfollow, \"justified\" by the invented words of the mythical St Paul:\"Wives submit to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife, asChrist isthe head of the Church. Now if the Church submits to Christ so shouldwives submitto their husbands in everything\"...and...\"But I suffer not a womanto teach, nor tousurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\"26Such words were written by the priesthood and initiates to introducetheinstitutionalised suppression of the female. This attitude can still be seentoday. AnnWiddicombe, a very mixed up British politician, even left theprotestant Church of210Children of the MatrixEngland and joined the Roman Catholics when women priests were allowed by theCof E. And this lady claims to be intelligent enough to run the country! TheIlluminati set out to close down the feminine, intuitive, energy, that connectsus all(including men) to our higher levels of being. The unrestrained maleenergy is \"outthere\", expressing itself outward into the physical world and,without the feminine,it becomes isolated from its deeper self. Macho man is an extreme expression ofthis.They are lost little boys who have symbolically lost touch with their inner\"Mum\".But while suppressing the female among the masses, these religions havecontinuedto covertly worship the Illuminati goddess, symbolised as the DragonQueen orqueens and the \"Snake Mother\". There has been increased pressure in thelast fewyears to increase still further the role of the mother-goddess, Mary, in theRomanCatholic Church. Millions of signatures have been received from 157countriespressing the Pope to make Mary a \"Co-Redemtrix\". They want Mary to berecognisedas equal to Jesus, in effect. All prayers and petitions from believerswould have toMary who would bring them to the attention ofJesus (a bit like adoctor's receptionist, really). She would alsoplay the pivotal role in thetrinity as daughter of the father,mother of the son, and spouse of the HolySpirit. Yes, I know it'sall bollocks, but it emphasises the scale of goddessworshipwithin the Illuminati's Roman Catholic Church, which, at thesame time,acts as a major suppressor of the human female.Mary Magdalene, the \"reformedprostitute\" or whore, isanother version of the goddess symbolism. She portrays theGreat Whore ofBabylon, the goddess, Mari-Anna-Ishtar.27The ritual of the \"sacred harlot\" or priestess anointing a saviour-king goesback to Sumer and further to Atlantis and, no doubt,Lemuria. It was a paganpriestess who announced theresurrection of Osiris, Attis, Dionysus, and Orpheus, just as MaryMagdalene wasthe first to see the \"resurrected\" Jesus. It's allsymbolism from the ancientmystery religions and it was used tocreate a mythical hero for a manufacturedprison-religion. As Ihave mentioned, MAG also appears to be code of thereptilianDNA passed on by the female line, the Mitochondrial DNA.Figure 33: ThePicture #71 [images/img_0071.png]ancients depicted their Jesus was crucjfjedSun gods with a haloaround their heads. Many of these mythical solar deities like Jesus werecrucified forThis is an image of the the sins of the people. It is an ancientritual. Jesus, the \"son\" onSun God Bel or Bil on a crosSi js the Sun at thespring equinox on one level and theBritish standing stone gai(jer on another.The crown of thorns is symbolic of thehalo, which the ancients portrayed around the head of all of their Sun gods(seeFigure 33). The points around the head of the Statue of Liberty and otherIlluminatideities are the rays of the Sun or crown of thorns. The wordsattributed to Jesus \"MyGod, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" were taken fromthe Passover ritual atJerusalem, according to some researchers. The cross itselfis not a uniquely Christiansymbol. It was used as a religious symbol for thousands of years beforeChristianity,and Jesus told his disciples to \"pick up thy cross and walk” beforethe crucifixioncross even entered the story. Indeed, the man on the cross was sowidely used by thepagans that the early Christians rejected it. The CentralAmerican god Quetzalcoatlwas depicted nailed to a cross. The cross is symbolicof the equinox when day andnight are equal and the Sun is about to win itsvictory over the darkness. At themoment Jesus died on the cross, according tothe Gospel narrative, the land becamedark. So it would if the Sun had died, asit was symbolically doing. As for theresurrection after three days, this is moreSun symbolism. In Persia, long beforeChristianity, they had a ritual in which ayoung man, apparently dead, was restoredto life. He was called the Saviour andhis sufferings were said to have ensured thesalvation of the people. His priestswatched his tomb until midnight on the equinoxand they cried: \"Rejoice, O sacredinitiated! Your God is risen. His death andsuffering have worked yoursalvation.\" The same was said in Egypt of Horns and inIndia of Krishna thousandsof years before Christianity. And Jesus could not havebeen crucified between twothieves because crucifixion was not the Romanpunishment for theft. The \"twothieves\" are possibly symbolic of Sagittarius andCapricorn, which cross over atthe winter solstice, thus the Sun \"dies\" between them.John the BaptistThis guy was invented from the stories of Anup, who baptised the ancientEgyptianSon of God, Horus. Like \"John\", Anup lost his head. Thor/Indara, thefirst king ofSumer, was known as \"Bil-the-Baptist” on Sumerian seals and he wasAd or Atumbaptising the infant crown prince in Egyptian sculpture. Baptism wasintroduced bythe Sumerians, not the Christians, and appears to have originated,at least in thepost cataclysmic era, in the Phoenician/St George centre ofCappadocia. John theBaptist, and his association with water, further symbolisesthe water sign ofAquarius, through which the Sun travels to be \"baptised\",according to myth. TheSun enters Aquarius at 30 degrees and Jesus is baptised at30. The zodiac circle wasrenamed the Crown of the Circle of the Holy Apostles(zodiac signs) by medievalmonks and they placed John the Baptist in the positionwhere Aquarius is located.(King Arthur and the 12 Knights of the Round Table arealso Sun and Zodiacsymbolism.) In the Roman Julian calendar John the Baptistdies on August 29th andJohn Jackson points out in Christianity Before Christ(American Atheists, 1985):\"On that day, a specially bright star, representing the head of theconstellation ofAquarius, rises whilst the rest of the body is below thehorizon, at exactly the sametime as the Sun sets in Leo (the kingly signrepresenting Herod). Thus the latterbeheads John, because John is associatedwith Aquarius, and the horizon cuts offthe head of Aquarius!\"28The reference to the \"man carrying the water pitcher\" in Luke's Gospel ismoreAquarius symbolism. John the Baptist was an almost exact copy of Bala-rama,theforerunner of Krishna, the Hindu Son of God.212Children of the MatrixJesus and the 12 disciplesIs there a universal law that all deities must have 12 disciples or followers?Jesushad them, so did Horus, Buddha, King Arthur, Mithra, Dionysus, and somanyother symbols of the Sun. We also have the 12 sons of Jacob, 12 tribes ofIsrael, the12 gods of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians. This fixation with 12derives onceagain from Sun symbolism with their disciples and followersrepresenting themonths of the year and the signs of the zodiac. The Romansopenly symbolised theSun as a living man and the signs of the zodiac as hisdisciples. And the Christianreligion was created in Rome. Mark, Luke, Matthew,and John, the names carried bythe Gospels, represent the four cardinal signs ofthe zodiac. These are alsosymbolised in Christian cathedrals as a man(Aquarius), an ox (Taurus), a lion (Leo),and an eagle (Scorpio), together calledthe four creatures of the apocalypse. JosephWheless says in Lorgery InChristianity (Health Research, 1990):\"...The Holy Twelve had no existence in the flesh, but their 'cue' being takenfrom OldTestament legends, they were mere names - dramatis personae - mask ofthe play -of 'tradition', such as Shakespeare and all playwrights andfiction-writers create forthe actors of their plays and works of admittedfiction.\"29In the ancient Mystery schools, long before \"Jesus\", the spokesman for thegodwas called a PETR or Peter. This means \"the rock\". In the Egyptian Book oftheDead, the name of the doorkeeper to heaven is Petra. Peter rushing into thewaterto greet Jesus is part of a ritual from ancient Egypt. The title Peter wasalso given tothe High Priest in the Babylon Mystery School. Peter furtherrelates to phallicworship. The cock was a symbol of St Peter and the very namePeter comes fromPater (phallus or male principle) and petra (phallic pillar).The cockerel, which canbe seen on so many church steeples, is an expression ofthis and the Christianchurches are full of ancient sexual symbolism. Thecountless references to \"pillars\"and \"groves\" in the Old Testament are alsopenis and vagina symbolism. Jesus saidthat Peter would deny him three timesbefore the cock crowed and this is anothertheme of the solar mystery cults. Thecock crowing three times was an omen ofdeath. The symbolism of the \"gate-keeper\"(Peter) denying the Sun permission torise before its due time was a ritual foundin a number of solar cults. The crow ofthe cock also announces the arrival ofthe Sun. Remember, too, that basilisk, themythical king of the serpents, becameinterchangeable with the term \"cockatrice\".It was said that the basilisk wasborn of the cocks egg and in decorative heraldrythe basilisk had the head andlegs of a cock, a snake-like tail, and the body of a birdcovered with serpentscales. The Roman god Janus, who held the keys, was fusedinto \"Peter\" whenChristianity was founded in Rome in the form we know it today-Janus was Eannus,a name for Nimrod in Babylon. Even in the early years of theRoman Church, whichwas supposed to have been founded on the \"rock\" of Peter,there is no mention ofthis guy. He was added to the story as the priesthoodcontinued to put the wholefantasy together. The name Andrew, another\"disciple”, has the same basic meaningas Pater, Petra, or Peter. This is why the213mythical \"Andrew\" is said to have been crucified at Patras in Greece,where\"Andrew\" was a local god.30James, the so-called \"brother of Jesus\", is a rehash of Amset, the brother oftheEgyptian Sun god, Osiris. Amset was a carpenter and James was a carpenter.Amsetwas a \"great purifier\" and James was a \"great purifier\". Disciple John, thefavouriteof \"Jesus\", is a repeat of Arjuna, the favourite disciple of Krishna.John is actuallyknown in Tibet as Argiun. John was the cousin of Jesus and hisoriginal, Arjuna,was the cousin of Krishna. Thomas was the disciple who insistedon touching Jesusafter the \"resurrection\" to prove he was in the flesh, hencethe term DoubtingThomas. But Thomas is Tammuz, that other saviour-god with theJesus credentials.The Christian Church dedicates the winter solstice, the daythe Sun \"dies\", to StThomas. The Hebrews still have a month they call Tammuz.Thomas the \"twin\" isalso symbolism. Thomas means \"twin\" in the Aramaic andSyriac languages andthe name Didymus, also associated with Thomas, comes fromthe Greek\"Didymos\", which was their name for the Roman \"Gemini\", the twins ofthezodiac. Acharya writes in her superb work, The Christ Conspiracy:\"It is said that Thomas preached to the Parthians and Persians, but what isbeingconveyed is that these groups were followers of Tammuz or Dumuzi, as washisSumerian name. Although it was alleged that Thomas's tomb was in Edessa,traditionalso claims that he died near Madras, India, where two of his tombs arestill shown.This tale comes from the fact that when Portuguese Christianmissionaries arrived insouthern India they found a sect who worshipped a godnamed \"Thomas\" and whosereligion was nearly identical to Christianity. Sodisturbed were the Christianmissionaries that they created elaborate stories toexplain the presence of the St.Thomas \"Christians\", claiming that the apostlesThomas and/or Bartholomew had atsome point travelled to India, preached and diedthere.\"31The missionaries were bewildered by the fact that the religion was \"Christian\"invirtually every aspect except one: they did not worship Jesus and had neverheard ofhim. The \"Thomas\" they were worshipping was Tammuz, the hero of the\"Jesus\"story for thousands of years before Christianity. Signs of Tammuz/Thomasworshiphave been found in India where, Acharya tells us, he was apparentlyconsidered a re-incarnation of Buddha! The villain of the Jesus story is Judas,who represents Scorpio,the \"backbiter\", the time of year when the Sun isweakening and appears to be dying.He was portrayed with red hair - the colour ofsunset - and so was the Egyptianfigure, Set, who sought to kill Horus. Judas issupposed to have betrayed Jesus for 30pieces of silver. This represents the 30days of the Moon cycle and it was the sameamount paid to the Great Goddess inJewish temples for each sacrificial victim.32St PaulHere we go again. The only record of the existence of St Paul or \"Saul ofTarsus” isin the New Testament texts. It is the same with Jesus, same with allof them, and thesame with the key players in the Old Testament stories. TheRoman historian214Children of the MatrixSeneca was the brother of the proconsul of Achaia when \"Paul\" was supposedtohave spoken there. But, although Seneca wrote about far more mundane matters,nota titter is recorded of Paul's public crusade. Who am I speaking about here?He livedin Tarsus in Asia Minor as a youngster; he went to Ephesus, where hespoke to vastcrowds and performed miracles, and travelled to Athens and Corinth;from there hewent to Rome where he was accused of treason, moved on to Spain andAfrica, andreturned to Sicily and Italy. He was summoned to Rome and thrown inprison, fromwhere he later escaped. Sounds remarkably like the story of theNazarene, \"St Paul\",but these events were from the life of the Greek figureApollonius of Tyana (called\"the Nazarene\" in some accounts). He was also knownin latin as \"Apollus\"and...\"Paulus\".33 Long before the stories about \"Paul\", theJewish historian Josephuswrote of a terrifying sea journey he experienced on hisway to Rome. His storyturns up again in precise detail in the New Testament,claiming to be an account ofwhat happened to \"Paul\".34 The story of Paul (and astory is all it is) also sharesmany detailed similarities with the myths of theGreek hero Orpheus, who, like\"Paul\", had a missionary called Timothy35. Thewriter H.G. Wells said that many ofthe phrases used by Paul for Jesus were thesame as those used by the followers ofMithra. The Liturgy of Mithra is theLiturgy of Jesus. When Paul is made to say \"Theydrank from the spiritual rockand that rock was Christ!\" he is using exactly the samewords found in thescriptures of Mithra. The author of an Internet article called \"TheOther Jesus\"picks up this theme:\"That the names of the close associates of Paul seem to be an exact match withgreatfigures associated with the mysteries of Demeter in general and withOrpheus inparticular, is yet another of those issues that bothers people muchless than it should...Let us examine the parallels: Orpheus, as a result of thepre-Christian son ofGod...having 'appeared' to him...mounted a highly successfulcampaign to spread hisversion of the mysteries of Samothrace [home of the Amazonfemale 'serpent' tribe fromAtlantis] to mainland Greece. Paul, we are told,because the Christian son of God, Jesus,\" appeared\" to him, mounted a highlysuccessful campaign to spread his versionChristian Jesus worship beyondPalestine and westward to mainland Greece.\"36This is an excellent example of my theme here. The initiated priesthood tookthesymbolic stories from their Mystery schools and presented them as historicalfact tocreate prison religions for the people. The rituals, rites, and themes ofthe Orpheuscults were the same as the later Christian ones. There is so muchmore to tell aboutthis story and I recommend The Christ Conspiracy, Bible Myths,and other bookslisted in the Bibliography if you want more detail and sources.The Bible hascontrolled the minds and lives of billions and has held much of theworld in mentaland emotional servitude for thousands of years. Christians laughat the idea ofreptilian bloodlines, and yet believe that their God would sendhis only son andmake him suffer vicious torture and a horrible death to forgivethe sins of everyoneelse. At the same time, we are told this is a god of love.It's nonsense, of course it is,but the writers knew that. It was not the truththey wished to communicate. Theidea was to manufacture strict religions, which would frighten people intoobeyingand believing. The whole thrust is that if you don't believe their\"truth\" you willend up in hell. However, to avoid the problem of everyone beingnice to each other(the last thing the Anunnaki want) they emphasise that you donot get to \"heaven\"through good works, but only by belief in Jesus as yoursaviour. You could causeuntold death and suffering during your life and stillbook your place in paradise, aslong as you believed in Jesus. Also, Jesus wasthe only one born without original sinand there was no way we could be \"perfect\"like him. You are bom a flawed, soiledpiece of shit before you breathe yourfirst, so know your place. The priesthoodparked their backsides between \"God\"and the people and made themselves themiddlemen for messages between the two.What the priesthood told the people todo was really \"God\" speaking through them,they claimed. This is why the Pope iscalled the Vicar of Christ, the deity'srepresentative on Earth.I look in some detail in The Biggest Secret at how the Gospel story waswrittenand how the Christian religion and the Bible were created, so 1 won'trepeat it allagain here, except for some key themes, which are important for newreaders toknow. There are two main theories for how the original Gospel(Gods-spell)narrative came to be compiled. One is the Piso theory. This wasdetailed by AbelardReuchlin in The True Authorship Of The New Testament, firstprinted in the UnitedStates in 1979. There is also a website called the PisoHomepage, which focuses onthis story and the Illuminati bloodlines.38 Reuchlintells of an inner circle or innerring, the most exclusive club in history, whoknew the \"Great Secret\". In this circle,he says, are the religious, political,and literary leaders, who knew the truth aboutJesus, but didn't want anyone elseto know. He writes:\"The New Testament, the Church and Christianity, were all the creation oftheCalpurnius Piso (pronounced Peso) family, who were Roman aristocrats. TheNewTestament and all the characters in it- Jesus, all the Josephs, all theMarys, all thedisciples, apostles, Paul, John the Baptist - all are fictional.The Pisos created thestory and all the characters; they tied the story to aspecific time and place inhistory; and they connected it with some peripheralactual people, such as theHerods, Gamaliel, the Roman procurators, etc. ButJesus and everyone involved withhim were created (that is fictional)characters.\"38The Pisos were bloodline and were related to the King Herod featured intheGospel story. As bloodline Roman aristocrats, they would have been initiatesof theMystery religions and the symbolic stories that were used to manufacture\"Jesus\"and his life. The Pisos claimed descent from the founders of Rome, the\"wolf-suckled\" Remus and Romulus. Reuchlin details the codes he says were usedin theGospel stories by the Pisos and their accomplice, the Roman writer andstatesman,Pliny the Younger. The head of the family, Lucius Calpurnius, who wasmarried tothe great granddaughter of Herod, was a close associate of the famousRomanwriter, Seneca. Both were killed by the Emperor Nero in the year AD65,Reuchlinsays. He suggests that the mythical stories of St Peter and St Paulbeing killed by216Children of the MatrixNero in Rome were inspired by these events. Reuchlin says that LuciusCalpurniuswrote his \"Ur Marcus\", the first version of the Gospel of Mark, inabout AD60 andthe others followed when the Pisos became very close to the Romanleadership.After his father's death, Arius Piso, who used many names, includingCestiusGallus, became governor of Syria and took command of the Roman army inJudea.He was involved in the Judean revolt in AD66, which Vespasian was sent toquell.Two years later Nero was killed by a Piso agent, according to Reuchlin,andVespasian became Emperor of Rome with vital backing from the Piso clan. ItwasVespasian who ordered the sacking of Jerusalem and stole the temple\"treasures\",including the Ark of the Covenant, whatever that was. Vespasian, asa Romanemperor, was an Illuminati frontman.According to Reuchlin's book, Arius Calpurnius Piso wrote three of the Gospelsinthe following order: the Gospel of Matthew (AD70-75); the updated Mark(75-80);and, with the help of Pliny the Younger, the updated Luke (85-90); Hesays that TheGospel of John was the work of Arius's son, Justus, and followed in105. Reuchlin iscertainly correct when he says that \"Jesus\" was a compositefigure, and the storiesinclude elements of the tales of Joseph in Egypt andother Old Testament characters,plus some writings from the Hebrew-EgyptianEssenes, the characteristics ofvarious pagan gods and Balder of the serpentcult. He also says that the Pisos madechanges and additions to some OldTestament texts and wrote most of the 14 OldTestament books known as theApocrypha. Reuchlin contends that Arius Piso wasthe real name of the \"Hebrew\"historian known as Josephus. This would certainlyexplain why a \"Hebrew\" likeJosephus, who claimed to have fought the Romans,lived in Rome for 30 years whilehe wrote books on Jewish history and married intoRoman aristocracy. Reuchlinsays that \"St Paul\" was manufactured in the same wayas Jesus and it'sinteresting that \"Paul's\" hazardous sea journey was a repeat ofwhat Josephussaid happened to him. Paul was also portrayed as a Hebrew whobecame a Romancitizen and Josephus said the same of himself.Reuchlin writes that between 100 and 105, Arius, his son Justus, and PlinytheYounger, travelled with their family and friends to Asia Minor, Greece,andAlexandria in Egypt, to encourage the poor and the slaves into joining theirnewfaith. Pliny created the first churches in Bithynia and Pontus, Reuchlinsays. Plinyhad visited these places a number of times in the year AD85 and this,he claims, wasthe origin of the first name of Pontius Pilate. The Romanprocurator was only calledPilate in Matthew and Mark, the first Gospels writtenby the Pisos, but in Luke, theone said to be written with Pliny, Pilate suddenlyacquires the name, Pontius. Lukewas written in the very years that Pliny beganto visit Pontus, according toReuchlin. Pliny's letters, written under his ownname, say that Justus Piso was inBithynia in the years 96 and 98 using the nameTullius Justus, and that the Pisos alsolocated in Ephesus, home of the greattemple to the goddess Artemis (Diana).Ephesus was also one of the birthplaces ofthe Christian religion. They visited allthe locations claimed for St Paul, andReuchlin says that Justus Piso and Pliny theYounger (military name, Maximus)introduced into their \"St Paul\" letters andstories many of their friends andcodes indicating their involvement. Paul refers to\"Greet Herodion my kinsman\", a code of the family connection to Herod,Reuchlinsays. It is a notable \"coincidence\" that the Pisos had extensive estatesin Provence inthe South of France, the very region where, the myths claim, theJesus storycontinued after the crucifixion thanks to Joseph of Aramathea, MaryMagdalene,and the Saviour's \"offspring\".Other researchers, like Acharya in The Christ Conspiracy, suggest that theGospelstories more likely came from the writings of a guy called Marcion ofPontus. Hewas not a believer in the literal existence of a Jesus-in-the-fleshand wrote the Jesusstory symbolically. Marcion was a Gnostic (a word meaning\"knowledge\") and theywrote widely in symbolism and allegory. Gnostic textsreferring to the Jesus storywhich were found in 1945 at Nag Hammadi in Egypt,have been used as \"proof\"that Jesus existed, but they are not. First they werewritten long after the \"event\"and second the Gnostics were allegorical writers.Moses Maimonedes, the Hebrewphilosopher and Gnostic of the 12th century, wrote:\"Every time that you find in our books a tale, the reality of which seemsimpossible, astory which is repugnant to both reason and common sense, then besure that thetale contains a profound allegory veiling a deeply mysterioustruth; and the greaterthe absurdity of the letter, the deeper the wisdom of thespirit.\"39Whoever wrote the original Gospel texts, it certainly wasn't the\"disciples\",Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as so many people believe. Not eventhe ChristianChurch claims that, but by using those names they can give thatimpression, andthe human mind is manipulated and guided through images andimpressions at theexpense of fact. It is a staggering thought that not onewriter of any Biblical work isknown or, as in the case of Paul, shown to havebeen a historical figure. 1 amconvinced myself, pending further evidence, thatthe Piso family were, at least insome way, involved in the creation of whatbecame the Christian religion. Theycertainly provided a number of the earlyPopes after the Illuminati's Roman Empirefounded the Roman Church.The naked emporerThe man most responsible for the emergence of Christianity as a global forceofcontrol and suppression was Constantine the Great. He became Roman EmperorinAD312 after slaughtering his way to power. Constantine, the architect ofChristianity,was the same bloodline as the Pisos. In one of the battles for theRoman leadership,at Milvian Bridge near Rome, the Christian legend claims thatConstantine saw avision of a cross in the sky with the words \"By this Conquer\".A pig in the skywould have been more likely. The next night, so it is said, hehad a vision of Jesuswho told him to put the cross on his flag to guaranteevictory. Constantine isclaimed to have converted to Christianity as a result ofhis visions, but the truthis that he never did, except perhaps on his death bedas a bit of insurance.Constantine, wait for it, was a Sun worshipper. His deitywas Sol Invictus or the\"Unconquered Sun\" and he remained to his death thePontifex Maximus of the218Children of the MatrixPagan Church. Sol was the name of an ancient Sun goddess. C.F. Oldham in TheSunAnd The Serpent (London, 1905) says that all solar dynasties were alsoserpentdynasties. He reads the meaning of serpent differently to me because 1think it has adouble meaning, but the connection between the two can always befoundwhichever way you interpret the symbol of the serpent. The worship of theSungoes hand in hand with the Illuminati's serpent rituals. Constantine threwhisbacking behind the Christian religion because to him it was no different tothe Suncult he followed. Christianity began to pick up many followers of Mithrafor thesame reason and many Pagans attacked the Christians for stealing theirreligion, sosimilar were they to each other. James H. Baxter, former Professorof EcclesiasticalHistory at St Andrews University in Scotland, said:\"If paganism had been destroyed, it was less through annihilation thanthroughabsorption. Almost all that was pagan was carried over to survive under aChristianname. Deprived of demi-gods and heroes, men easily andhalf-unconsciously investeda local martyr with their attributes...transferringto him the cult and mythologyassociated with the pagan deity. Before the fourthcentury was over the martyr cultwas universal...pagan festivals were re-namedand Christmas Day, the ancientfestival of the Sun, was transformed into thebirthday of Jesus.\"The defining moment in Christian history came in AD325 when Constantinecalledtogether 318 bishops of the \"Christian” Church to his palace at Nicaea (nowIznikin Turkey) for the infamous Council of Nicaea. I say \"Christian\", but infactthere were representatives of the Sun and Moon cults of Apollo, Osiris andIsis,Demeter/Ceres, Dionysus/Bacchus, Jupiter/Zeus, and, of course, SolInvictus. SoJesus was naturally given the birthday of December 25th; thebirthday of the Sun.Nicaea was the moment when Jesus and Christ were broughttogether for the firsttime in the way of the other \"anointed\" Sun Gods. TheCouncil was convened toend the conflict and squabbling between the followers ofSt Paul's \"Jesus\", asupernatural god, and those who questioned that Jesus couldbe the same as God.The latter were called the Arians after their leader, Arius,a churchman inAlexandria, Egypt. Amid fistfights and mayhem, it was \"decided\",onConstantine's insistence, that all Christians must believe in the supernaturalJesus -or else. This belief, which is the foundation of Christianity to thisday, was\"defined\" in the so-called Nicene Creed:\"We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of all things, both visibleandinvisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the son of God, begotten of theFather, onlybegotten, that is to say, of the same substance of the Father, Godof Gods and Lightof Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made, being ofone substance with theFather, by whom all things were made, both things inheaven and things on Earth;who, for as men and our salvation, came down and madeflesh, made man, sufferedand rose again on the third day, went up to theheavens, and is to come again tojudge the quick and the dead; and in the HolyGhost.\"That's what they said about Nimrod and Tammuz-Ninus in Babylon, andgoodnessknows how many other deities in the pre-Christian world. The delegatesat Nicaeawere told how to vote and those who refused were banished to remoteislands. Fromthis time, the Nicene Creed waged war on humanity as tens ofmillions wereslaughtered in its name and the order went out to destroy allevidence thatexposed their manufactured story as a scam. Native cultures (andtheir records ofhistory) were destroyed in an orgy of genocide and inquisitionlasting centuriesand spanning the world. The \"Holy Inquisition\" of the RomanChurch was notofficially disbanded until the 19th century and today it is knownas the \"HolyOffice\". The Great Library of Alexandria \"City of the Serpent's Son\"and othercentres of priceless ancient knowledge and records were destroyedunder thebanner of this vicious, arrogant, creed. When the library at Alexandriawasdestroyed in AD391 by the order of the Emperor Theodosius some 700,000scrolls,codices and manuscripts were lost forever. The force behind all this knewexactlywhat they were doing: selling the masses a myth through which theiragenda ofsuppressing knowledge and rewriting history could be justified.BehindConstantine, the Pisos, and the Popes were the Babylon reptilianBrotherhood,by now located in Rome. Their rituals, temples, and symbols were theorigin ofthose used today by Freemasons. These include the black and whitesquaredfloors, white gloves and aprons, secret signs and handshakes. Elitesecretsocieties like the Order of Comacine Masters grew rapidly underConstantine(see The Biggest Secret).The \"Christian\" bloodlinesThe bloodline theme continues with the creation and expansion of Christianity.Themajor players in the history of Christianity have been the same bloodline,thereptilian bloodline. Among them were the Piso family, Herod theGreat,Constantine the Great, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of what we nowcallSpain, who launched the Spanish Inquisition and supportedChristopherColumbus, and King James 1st, who sponsored the translation of theKing JamesVersion of the Bible which, according to a survey in 1881, contains36,131 translationerrors.40 All of these people are the same bloodline (seeAppendix I). So are JosephSmith and Brigham Young, the founders of the Mormons,and Charles Taze Russell,one of the founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Give methe statistical chances ofthat. It was these very forces that created the Bibleand decided what would be in it.They brought together the texts of the OldTestament with the texts they wrote, orchose, to form the New. They translatedit into Latin, English, and other languages.Even the original versions of thebiblical texts continued to be changed and newphrases added whenever it suitedthem. The philosopher, Celsus, wrote to theChurch leaders in the 3rd century:\"You utter fables, and you do not even possess the art of making them seemlikely...You have altered three, four times and oftener, the texts of your ownGospels inorder to deny objections to you.\"41220Children of the MatrixCelsus said that the church leaders were forever telling their followers nottoexamine the evidence, but to simply believe - \"Wisdom is a bad thing inlife,foolishness is to be preferred.\" He also wrote: \"They openly declared thatnone, butthe ignorant [were] fit disciples for the God they worshipped” and hesaid that therule was \"let no man that is learned come among us\".42 It was, andis, a religion tohijack the minds of the masses and to remove all those who knewthe truth. But it isnot the only myth religion that has been taken literally. Soare all the rest. EvenBuddhism, which is claimed to be more enlightened, camefrom the same sourceand was sold as historical fact. Look at Buddha'sbackground. He was born onDecember 25th to the virgin Maya, with a star and wisemen in tow. He was a\"royal\" bloodline and the ruler was told to kill the childto avoid being overthrown.He taught in the temple at 12, was tempted by the evilMara, and baptised in thepresence of the Spirit of God. He performed miracles,healed the sick, and fed 500people with a small basket of cakes. He died (insome traditions on a cross) and wasresurrected to Nirvana or heaven. His tombwas miraculously opened and it wassaid he would return and judge the dead.Buddha was the \"Light of the World\", the\"Lord\" and \"Master\", the \"GoodShepherd\", and \"Carpenter\". The usual CV. InIndia, Buddha's consort is said tohave been Ila or Ida and this was a name in theBritish Edda for El, the serpentgoddess of the \"Edenites\".Group sectsThe Illuminati strategy can be seen so vividly in their religions. First, youcreate theoriginal belief, like the belief in \"Jesus\". This triggers divisionand conflict with theother religions around that time. Then you shatter thatoriginal belief into an ever-expanding list of sub-beliefs and offshoot\"churches\". Now you have divisionbetween the belief and other beliefs, andwithin the belief itself. What a perfectsituation for divide and rule. This hashappened with Christianity, and the majorfault-line was the work of anIlluminati frontman called Martin Luther. In 1517, thisProfessor of Theology atWittenberg University listed 95 complaints against theVatican for sellingpardons to raise money to build St Peter's Church. Luther wasexcommunicated, buthe burned the decree along with copies of Roman Church lawand launched his ownLutheran Church. Protestant Christianity was born and it wasused to engineeruntold war and yet more slaughter. Countries fought each otherand justified itas \"defending the faith\". Defending the agenda, more like. Ironically,theEnglish king Henry VIII first supported Rome and was rewarded with thepapaltitle, Defender of the Faith. But Henry, when he wasn't killing his wives,changed hismind and supported the Luther \"revolution\". He kept the title,though, and this isthe origin of the term Defender of the Faith used by Britishmonarchs to this day. TheBritish crown is supposed to defend ProtestantChristianity, but carries the titleawarded by a Pope! It's all such a farce.Martin Luther, who used a rose and a crossas his personal seal, was an agent ofthe Rosicrucian order, that ancient strand in theIlluminati web. Luther'sProtestant creed was subdivided into countless sects.One was Calvinism, which later became the sickness of the mind known asthePuritan faith. This was used most effectively to instigate and justify thegenocide ofthe Native Americans. The real name of John Calvin, the man who started allthis,was Jean Cauin. He came from Noyons in France and was educated attheIlluminati's College du Montagu. This is where Ignatius Loyola, the\"Catholic\"founder of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, was educated. TheJesuits go very highin the Illuminati network. Cauin moved to Paris and then toGeneva, Switzerland,where he was known as Cohen. This name comes from Cahen, thename for priestor prince in the ancient Egyptian Mystery schools. In Geneva, hedeveloped, ormore likely someone else did, the \"philosophy\" known as Calvinism.He changedhis name again from Cohen to Calvin to make it more acceptable to theEnglish whonow became the prime target of this new religion. Calvinism was adesigner-religion for the next stage of the plan. It focused rigidly on the TenCommandmentsof \"Moses\" and the literal interpretation of the Old Testament textsand it achievedmany goals for the Illuminati. Up to this point, the Christianreligion had bannedusury, the charging of interest on loans, but Calvinismallowed it. This was perfectfor the Illuminati bankers manoeuvring at this timeto take over England. Andwhen interest on loans became the norm, thanks toCalvinism, one of the greatestbeneficiaries was Switzerland, where this\"religion\" was devised. Another role forCalvinism was to insist on the burningof \"witches\" and, in so doing, take more ofthe secret knowledge out ofcirculation, along with many DNA lines passedthrough the female that theAnunnaki wished to eliminate.The Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are two other Illuminati religions,whichhave emerged from the Judeo-Christian fantasy. I must stress again herethat I amnot challenging the right of anyone to follow any religion. Good luckto them,and there are many lovely, genuine, people involved in Christianity, Judaism,Mormonism, the Jehovah's Witnesses and all the rest. I am merely seeking toexposethe manipulation of the hierachy and the background that the rank and filearenever told. Joseph Smith founded the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatterDay Saints, after he claimed that an \"angel\" called Moroni appeared to himin 1823.This Moroni guy, he said, told him of the existence of a book of goldplatescontaining \"the fullness of the everlasting gospel\" and \"an account of theformerinhabitants of this continent and the sources from which they sprang\". Thelocationwas revealed to him and in 1827, with help from two \"magic stones\"called Urimand Thummim, he translated the plates into English. Urim and Thummimwere, infact, the names of knucklebones or dice used by Levite priests, and the kingsofIsrael were said to follow their prophecies. These knucklebones were used intheMystery school \"holy place\" known as the Tabernacle. Here we have yet anotherreligion originating from the same source and another perpetuation of theJesusmyth. The gold plates. Smith said, were written in \"reformed Egyptian\".From thiscame the Book of Mormon two years later and his followers became theMormonChurch in 1830. The pillars of the early Church were Smith, his brotherHiram, andanother guy called Brigham Young. They were all high-degree Freemasonsand allfrom the Merovingian bloodline - the same as Piso, Constantine, James1st, etc., etc.It is no surprise, therefore, to find that the Rothschilds,through their Kuhn, Loebfinancial operation in New York, funded the expansion ofthe Mormons. Kuhn,222Children of the MatrixLoeb also helped to fund the Russian Revolution and the First World War (see...AndThe Truth Shall Set You Free). The Mormons were an Illuminati creation. Mormonsrecognise the Bible, but believe that Smith's writings are equally divine. Theyset upcommunities called Stakes of Zion (Sion = the Sun) and eventually settledin SaltLake City, Utah, the Mormon city from where its sacrificial rituals andmind controlprogrammes are orchestrated. Another sacrifice and mind control sectto emergefrom the Judeo-Christian scam is the Jehovah's Witness or WatchtowerSocietyalthough as always, the vast majority of its advocates have no idea thisis so. Thisworships the Hebrew angry god Jehovah. One of its leading founderswas thepaedophile and Merovingian bloodline, Charles Taze Russell, a high-degreeFreemason. Russell was close to the Rothschilds and, again, Kuhn, LoebandCompany funded his operation.Islam was created to further polarise the religious divides and in TheBiggestSecret I show some of the connections between the secret societiesbehind\"Christianity\", including the Knights Templar, and those at the heart ofIslam.Among these were the Assassins, from whom we get the term forpoliticallymotivated murder. The Muslim faith and the creed of Islam wereinspired by thestory of Mahomet or Mohammed. This was very similar in theme to theofficialversion of how Joseph Smith inspired the Mormon religion. In 612, it issaid,Mohammed had a \"vision\" and was told to start a new faith - just as Smithlaterclaimed. The date is interesting because some ancient peoples were told toexpectan incarnation of \"God\" every 600 years and Mohammed came 600 years after\"Jesus\". Once again the Muslims encompass elements of theJudeo-Christianfantasy. Muslims see Islam as an updated continuation ofJudeo-Christian themesand they, too, trace their ancestry back to Abraham in theOld Testament, thealleged origin of the Hebrew belief system. Muslims believethat Abraham built theKaaba, the sacred shrine of Mecca, and the focus ofpilgrimage for Muslims all overthe world. But it was originally a Pagan templeto goddess worship featuring thefamous Black Stone. W. Wynn Westcott, a founderof the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, wrote in his work. The Magical Mason,that the Black Stone was firstused for Pagan rituals. A stone is ancientsymbolism for the penis and for thisreason many religions were founded on astone or a \"rock\", as with Peter the rockand Christianity. In the Old Testamenttale of Jacob, he anointed his stone with oil,which sounds like great fun. Musttry that one. The Koran, the Islamic holy book,which is supposed to have been inspired by God, mentions Jesus in 93 versesandtreats him as a living person when clearly he was not. Allah, the Islamicgod, is thesame god, the Muslims say, as the Judeo-Christian Jehovah. They givecredence tothe Pentateuch, the first five books of \"Moses\" in the Old Testament,but in truth thebooks of the Levites. Muslims say that Mohammed was the latestprophet (apartfrom all the others since) and therefore, the most valid. As such,all Christians andHebrews should convert to Islam, the orthodox Muslims demand.The term Jihad isthe \"Holy War\" that Muslims are urged to wage against all ofthose who will notaccept the law of Mohammed. The very word, Islam, means \"tosubmit orsurrender\" and Muslim means \"one who submits\".Islam was another Illuminati creed that was to cost the lives of hundredsofmillions in the bloody wars waged with Christianity and Judaism. These arethreeprison religions ultimately controlled by the same force. Islam, likeChristianity andJudaism, was also a vehicle for the systematic suppression ofwomen and thefeminine principle. Again we see the connection to Freemasonry.After earning thethree Blue Lodge Degrees of Freemasonry and completing theScottish or York Ritedegrees, Masons can petition to become a Shriner. These whoswear a blood oathand confess Allah as God.43 Allah is a Moon god. This is whyyou will see a crescentMoon at the top of mosques around the world, and why theShriners have thecrescent Moon on their fez hats. This symbol is on the flags ofvarious Islamicnations and Muslims fast during the month that begins and endswith theappearance of the crescent Moon in the sky.\"I liked your face...\"The city of Jerusalem, the ironically named City of Peace, is the myth capitalof theworld. I went there in 1993 to see this most sacred of shrines toChristians, Hebrews,and Muslims. What a summary of how religion has gripped andmanipulated thehuman mind for so long. The Old City, although not very big, isstill broken inquarters for Christians, Hebrews, Muslims, and Armenians. Afterall, we don'twant to set a precedent and live together. If you want to buy amyth ormisunderstanding, this is the place. They've got hundreds of them. Onstreetcorners and at every church or monument there they are, lying in wait,thosespiritual used car salesmen, the tourist guides. Many of them wear blackleatherjackets like some extra from The Godfather. These are the silver-tonguedrepeaters ofmake-believe who will sell you a myth tour of anywhere. Even at 7.30in themorning, as I walked through the Jaffa Gate and into the near-desertedstreets of theOld City, I was not safe. I felt someone touch my arm.\"Hello my friend,” a voice said \"You from England? I know many people inEngland.They come from Glasgow. You know Glasgow?\"I knew his game immediately, but I decided to stick with him and seewhathappened. He said he approached me because \"I liked your face\". As hehadapproached me from behind, I had clearly witnessed the latest recordedmiracle inJerusalem. I have no doubt that it has by now been added to thetourist itinerary.He said he wanted to show me around because he liked me. Themoney he woulddemand at the end had nothing to do with it, of course. He showedme the WailingWall, or Western Wall, that most sacred of places in the Hebrewreligion, wherethey think they can speak to God. This ritual goes back at leastto the wailing forTammuz in Babylon. Jews leave little messages for God in thecracks between thestones and they now offer a fax service to believers all overthe world. You fax yourmessage to Jerusalem and someone goes along and sticks itin a crack in theWailing Wall. My next stop was Bethlehem, a short bus ride fromJerusalem. If youhave never been there, forget the idea of \"O Little Town ofBethlehem\". It's a rightdump and an extension of the sprawl of modem Jerusalem.I walked with my\"guide\" through \"Manger Square\" to the Church of the Nativity onthe site where224Children of the MatrixJesus is supposed to have been born. It is built over the cave where theBabylonianand Hebrew Son of God, Tammuz, was also said to have miraculouslyentered theworld. Popular place. The travel guide to Jerusalem and the \"HolyLand\" is in nodoubt, however. It states categorically: \"This Church is situatedabove the Grotto ofthe Nativity, a small subterranean chamber, in which a silverstar marks the placeof Jesus' birth.\" At the height of the tourist season,people stand in line for hours tosee this grotto; such is the power of myth andmind control. But this, luckily, wasthe off-season and I walked right in. What aperformance unfolded before me. Asmall group of tourists watched as three mendressed up in various regalia werewailing away at each other. The only word Icould make out was the odd\"Hallelujah\". One man in a black hood was leading aceremonial sing song, whileanother put on a crown and drank from a goblet in amanner that suggested hehad just returned from the desert. The third man, wholooked in urgent need of agood laugh, swished around with some object on achain, which puffed out smokeoccasionally. The one with the crown finished hisdrink and proceeded to readloudly and earnestly from a big red book. In Britain,the most famous big red bookbelongs to a television show called This Is YourLife. Personalities appear in front ofa studio audience to have their lifestories told by a man reading from the said, bigred book. The book in the grottowas a sort of \"Jesus Christ, this is your life\"and if the television showpresented the lives of the rich and famous asinaccurately as the Church has withJesus, they would be sued or laughed outof existence in a month.Outside the grotto in Bethlehem, the guide introduced me to a friend of his.\"Helikes your face,\" my guide informed me, \"and he invites you back to his homefor adrink.\" We arrived at his \"home\" after a few seconds' walk. It was a nicehome, butstrange in a way. It had a large front window, credit card signs,counters, a cashregister, and lots of shelves with things on. If I didn't knowbetter, I would havesaid it was the image of a big souvenir shop. As I lookedaround, I didn't knowwhether to laugh or scream. You could buy holy this, holythat, holy anything. Ididn't see any holy toilet paper, but it must have beenthere. In fact, given all thecrap spoken about religion, I would have thought itessential. Among my favouriteswere little crosses made from \"holy earth from theholy land\". In case I thought thiswas a con, the wrapper assured me: \"Each oneinspected by a genuine Catholicfamily\". Phew, that's a relief then. But nothingcould surpass the plastic models ofJesus, in all sizes to suit all pockets. Ifyou bought the small version, your Jesus onlyhad a bit of wire for a halo, butreally go for it and buy the deluxe model and youtoo, could have a plastic babyJesus with three genuine, gold-painted prongssticking out of his head. As Isurveyed this wondrous sight, the shop ownermade his move:\"They are genuine,\" he said.\"Genuine? A genuine baby Jesus?\"\"They are made by local priests.\"\"Ah, that kind of genuine.\"I returned to the Old City and the guide who liked my face wanted hismoney.Anything 1 gave him would be acceptable, he said, and then he tried todouble it.We said goodbye and 1 walked around the outside of the city wall tothe \"Garden ofGethsemane\", another \"Jesus\" site. When 1 was close, I asked apasser-by the way.He was most helpful and offered to show me. But hold on aminute, wasn't that ablack leather jacket he was wearing? Suddenly heshape-shifted from passer-by intotourist guide:\"This is the very tree where Jesus was arrested...these trees have been herefor...\"\"Excuse me. Thank you for your help, but 1 only want to stand here on my own,if it's okay with you.\"\"You mean you don't want me to show you the church and the tomb of Maryand...\"\"No, thanks, all the same.\"\"I give you good price.\"By the end of my trip, 1 had this nightmare of leaving my physical body attheend of this life and a spirit in a black leather jacket touches my arm.\"Hello myfriend,” he says \"Are you from Planet Earth? 1 know many people onPlanet Earth. 1show you heaven. I like your face.\" A Muslim taxi driver summedit up when 1asked him if he believed all these stories about Jesus. He had noidea, he said, but:\"Jesus is very good for tourist buses and taxi driversbecause he moved around alot.\" Religion is a whole bloody industry ripping offgenuine people, mentally,emotionally, spiritually, and financially. Millions areon the payroll. Bishops'palaces, tourist guides, tacky gift shops, entireeconomies and political systems insome countries. All depend for their survivalon this perpetuation of make believe.From the Vatican to Bethlehem, fromJerusalem to Salt Lake City, the cash registersgo on dancing to the music ofmyth. The Vatican and the other bastions of mindcontrol know the informationexists that would bring them crashing down. That'swhy they have worked so hardto suppress it. Unless they do, the party's over. Nowonder there is so muchopposition to information that will expose this global contrick when theeconomic and personal power of church and state depends ondeception ofmonumental proportions.1 must be one of the few people on the planet who can bring together inmutualcondemnation all these conflicting religious dogmas - and a few morebesides. 1have been called anti-Semitic for my exposure of Judaism and peoplelike theRothschilds; 1 have been shunned and condemned by Christians forexposing thehistorical background to their religion and its present-dayhypocrisy; from SouthAfrica an \"Icke Alert\" was sent out across the Internetwarning that I was anti-Children of the MatrixIslam; and many New Agers condemn me for being \"too negative\" (saying whatisreally happening) and for exposing the \"spiritual\" charlatans and theIlluminatimanipulation of the New Age mentality. The reason I can unite suchapparentlyopposing groups is that they all have one thing in common. They eachhave adogma to sell or defend. As 1 am challenging all dogmas, impositions,andsuppression, I can bring them together as one indignant voice. Theyareopposames, the same attitude with a different frock on, but more and morepeopleare freeing themselves from these prisons of the mind. TheIlluminati-Anunnakicould not care less which religion or mind-prison you choose,so long as youchoose one of them. My philosophy on this is simple: if you canput a name towhat you believe, you have built a wall around your mind. Itdoesn't matter what\"ism\" or \"ianity\" it may be. Once you can give it a name youare closing the dooron infinity where everything just is and we all just are.There are no names forinfinite knowledge. It encompasses all that is, and oncewe succumb to an \"ism\"we disconnect from all that is. But then that's the idea,the whole point for religionin the first place - slamming the door on humanconsciousness. Even those whoclaim to have rejected conventional religioncontinue to be caught in its illusions.In the New Age, which does not believe inthe Christian view, the myth of Jesusgoes on. The Son of God of Christianity hasbecome the New Age \"Sananda\", theirname for \"Jesus\". To them he is a spiritualmaster channelling wisdom fromanother dimension and, in other versions, he wasan initiate of the Essenecommunity in Biblical Israel. Others who reject theofficial interpretations of theBible stories also believe that Jesus existed insome form and they seek to constructtheir own thesis by re-interpreting thetexts. They can read massive implicationsand revelations in the most innocuousword or phrase. Now the latest spin on\"Jesus\" is that his bloodline wascontinued through his children conceived withMary Magdalene and became the\"true\" royal bloodline. Yawn. The veil only liftswhen you realise that most ofthe Bible is pure invention. The symbolic madeliteral. No matter how you seek tointerpret the words, it will almost always endup as bollocks because you aretrying to literally interpret texts that were bollocksto start with. Only whenwe have a blank sheet of paper in our minds, free fromthis intellectual andspiritual pollution, can we possibly have the clarity to seethrough the game.Religion has been a curse on the world, and humanity will never knowfreedomuntil this curse has been exorcised. It is the curse of ignorance, whichhas cast itsdark shadow over thousands of years of human suppression by theAnunnaki andtheir bloodlines. More than anything, religion has been the drivingforce behindhumanity's suppression of itself.God save us from religion 227SOURCES1 Our Haunted Planet, pp 140 and 1432 See The Woman's Encylopedia Of Myths And Secrets, pp 963 and 964, forthisbackground to the Sun Goddess legends and accounts3 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 1004 The Woman's Encylopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 9055 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 2216 Ibid, p 2247 Ibid, pp 224 and 2258 The Woman's Encylopedia Of Myths And Secrets, p 5759 Ibid, p 58010 The Phoenician Origin Of Britons, p 14711 Acharya S, The Christ Conspiracy, The Greatest Story Ever Sold (AdventuresUnlimited,Kempton, Illinois, 1999). p 241.

And we can - lotsof it.Since 1990 when I began to consciously investigate what was really happeninginthe world, 1 had heard mention of reptilian beings. But naturally it seemedsofantastic that 1 put the information on the back burner until 1 could makesome senseof it. That started to happen in early 1998 when 1 was travellingaround the UnitedStates. In a period of about 15 days 1 met 12 separate peoplein different locations,andfrom very contrasting walks of life, who told me the same basic story of seeinga\"human\" change into a reptilian form before their eyes. The people who told metheseaccounts included two television interviewers who saw their guest, asupporter of theNew World Order agenda, shape-shift during a live interview.Afterwards one said hehad been shocked to see the man's face turn reptilian andthe other, equally shocked,said that she had seen his hands take on a reptilianlook. Given that the viewers sawnothing, most of them anyway this had to be acase of psychically connecting withthe fourth-dimensional level of the guyrather than seeing a physical shift. A friend ofone of these presenters was apoliceman in Denver, Colorado, a major Illuminati andSatanic centre, wherereptilian gargoyles (an Illuminati code) adorn the DenverAirport. The policemanhad made a routine visit to an office block in Aurora, nearDenver, and commentedto an executive of one of the companies there about the highlevel of security inthe building. She said that he should look at the upper floors if hewanted tosee some real security. She pointed to a lift that only went to the higherfloorsand she told him of an astonishing experience she had some weeks earlier.Thelift had opened and a strange figure emerged. He was albino-white with afaceshaped like a lizard and eyes with pupils that were vertical like areptile's. Thehighest level of the \"Draco royalty\" are albino-white. This whitelizard figure hadwalked out of the restricted lift, she said, and into anofficial-looking car. Thepoliceman was so intrigued by the story and thebuilding that he made investigationsinto the companies in the upper floors.According to his friend, he said he found themall to be fronts for the CentralIntelligence Agency, the CIA.230Children of the MatrixAnother man I met in that 15 days used to take large quantities of LSD inthe1960s and around the third day of a five-day \"trip\", as he put it, the samethingalways happened: some people began to look like reptiles and it was alwaysthesame people. It never changed. He also began to observe that his friendswhoappeared lizard-like in his \"trips\" always seem to react the same way tomovies,television programmes, and so on. \"We used to laugh and say 'here comethelizards'\", he told me. Drugs take people into altered states of consciousnessand thiscan cause them to \"retune\" their dial to the lower fourth dimension. Atthis pointthey will see that level of the people around them. Looking back froma perspectiveof greater knowledge, he believes there is what he calls a\"morphogenetic field\"transmitted to the DNA of the lizard people and thisaligned the cell structure to thereptilian genetic blueprint. The more reptilianDNA a person carries, the easier it isfor this to happen, and the ones with mostreptilian DNA are the hybrid bloodlinesof the Anunnaki designed specifically tooccupy the positions of power.Interestingly, the Olmec people of CentralAmerica, whose whole culture was basedon serpent worship, used to takehallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that theycalled \"the flesh of the PlumedSerpent\", and this took them into a fourth-dimensional awareness - the serpentfrequency. In their rituals to the \"serpent son\"Dionysus (another \"Jesus\"), theGreek initiates would drink strong wine and takemind-altering drugs andmushrooms to \"unite with their Son of God\". At the end ofthose 15 days in theUnited States, when I was speaking at a Whole Life Expo eventin Minneapolis, agifted psychic lady told me how she sees people in power, likeHenry Kissinger,George Bush, and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptilians all the time.Once againshe is accessing their fourth-dimensional frequency. There are few moreglaringexamples of cold reptilian eyes than those of Hillary Clinton. One trait Ihavenoticed in these shape-shifters or possessed people is that their eyesdon'tchange, no matter what their mouth or the rest of their face are doing.They mightbe laughing, for instance, but their eyes never do. They have a fixed,cold, stare.Next time you see Hillary Clinton, watch her eyes.I recalled at this stage that I had read something about reptilians in thebook,Trance-Formation Of America, which details the life of a remarkable womancalledCathy O'Brien. Her Satanic father, who had abused her violently andsexually fromthe time she was a baby in Michigan in the 1950s, handed her overto Gerald Ford -later President Ford - for use in the Illuminati's now vast mindcontrol operation,which I expose at length in The Biggest Secret. Cathy isblond-haired and blue-eyed,the usual story, and I recommend her book to anyonewho wants to know what ishappening to literally millions and millions ofchildren around the world. I lookedthrough the index to find the reptilianreferences and, although she rationalised theexperience as a mind-controlillusion, what she describes is the same experience thatso many others have beenreporting. I explained earlier about Miguel de la Madrid,the President of Mexicoin the George Bush years in the White House, and his storyof theextraterrestrial shape-shifters he called the \"Iguana race\". These were theones,he said, who were perfect for \"transforming into world leaders\". In thebook, Cathyreveals how George Bush, one of her main controllers, shape-shifted.She says he231was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when he opened abookdepicting \"lizard-like aliens from a far-off deep space place\". Bush claimedto be oneof them and she said he appeared to transform \"like a chameleon\" into areptile.Cathy tells in the book of how Bill and Bob Bennett, two well-knownfigures in USpolitics, gave her mind-altering drugs at NASA's Goddard SpaceFlight Center mindcontrol laboratory. They told her they were \"alien to thisdimension - two beingsfrom another plane\". Yes, the lower fourth dimension.Cathy continues:\"The high-tech light display around me convinced me I was transformingdimensionswith them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me. whichseemed to explodeinto a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - asthough I had transformeddimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognisinganyone, I frantically asked:'Who are these people?'\"'They're not people and this isn't a spaceship'. [Bill] Bennett said. As hespoke, theholographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appearedto be lizard-likealiens. ’Welcome to the second level of the underground. Thisis a mere mirrorreflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from atrans-dimensional plane thatspans and encompasses all dimensions...''\"...I have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishingstrongerholds on your mind than the Earth plane permits' Bill Bennett wassaying. 'Beingalien, I simply make my thoughts your thoughts by projecting theminto your mind.My thoughts are your thoughts...'\"1This is another way that people are controlled and manipulated - bythoughttransference. The reptilian mind becomes the human mind and you can seethishappening all the time as the reptilian \"hive\" mind becomes the human\"hive\"mentality. Soon after returning from the USA and the rapid escalation ofmy reptilianresearch, 1 went to see a woman in England to discuss her knowledgeof Satanicrituals involving people like Ted Heath, the former Conservative PrimeMinister ofBritain from 1970 to 1974. He signed the UK into the Illuminati'sEuropeanCommunity, now Union, and persists to campaign for our furtherabsorption intothis centralised fascist state. As I was finishing this book,government papers werereleased after 30 years, which showed how Heath knew thatentry into the EuropeanCommunity would eventually mean the end of Britishsovereignty. But at the timehe denied this because the reptilians and theirclones will say whatever is necessaryto achieve their ends. Heath comes up oftenwhen you speak with the victims ofthese rituals - those who survive - and theirtorture as children by the Satanic rings.This lady was brought up by a Scottishfamily and was sexually and ritually abusedby the highly significant ScottishIlluminati network. As a result of this background,she became the wife of thewarden of an area of woodland called Burnham Beeches,a few miles from Slough,west of London. It is an ancient site mentioned in theDomesday Book of the 11thcentury, and it is not far from both the British Prime232Children of the MatrixMinister's country residence called Chequers (chequers = black and white squaresofFreemasonry) and the former Wycombe (Wicca) home of the Hellfire Club(El-fire,the \"Fiery El\") with its human sacrifice rituals involving royalty andthe Americanfounding father, Benjamin Franklin (see The Biggest Secret). BurnhamBeeches isowned by the City of London, the globally- important financialdistrict, and one ofthe most powerful Illuminati operational centres on theplanet. For those who don'tlive in the UK, the City of London does not mean thewhole of the capital. It is thearea surrounding St Paul's Cathedral where theoriginal city stood and it was rebuiltby initiates like Sir Christopher Wrenafter the Great Fire of London in 1666. It is nowa district within the vastsprawl we call London. The coat of arms of the City ofLondon, an image you findall over Burnham Beeches, is dominated by two flyingreptiles holding a shieldadorned by the red cross on the white background, theAtlantean-Sumerian fire orsun cross, also used by the Knights Templar. When youenter the City of Londonyou pass two flying reptiles on each side of the road andwhere the City ofLondon meets the area called Temple Bar, named after the KnightsTemplar, thereis another flying reptile in the centre of the road. Temple Bar istheheadquarters of the global legal profession and includes more elite secretsocietiesper square mile than almost anywhere else on Earth. It is from thisIlluminati centre,then, that Burnham Beeches is administered.The lady who told me about this area said that her husband, the warden inchargeof the place, was a Satanist. She said he had to be to get the job. They livedina big house in the woods and part of his work was arranging Satanic ritualsthere.She said that one night in the early 1970s while Ted Heath was PrimeMinister, shewas walking through the woods after dark when she saw some lights.Quietly, shemoved forward to see what they were and to her horror she saw aSatanic ritualinvolving Heath and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, AnthonyBarber. There is anartist's impression of the scene she saw in the picturesection. She said that as shewatched, hidden among the trees and undergrowth.Heath began to transform intoa reptile and she said what staggered her was thatno one in the circle looked theleast bit surprised. \"He eventually became afull-bodied reptiloid, growing in sizeby some two foot,\" she said. This is acommon description by witnesses. She said hewas \"slightly scaly\" and \"spokefairly naturally\", although it sounded like \"longdistance - if you imagine theshort time lapses\". I met Heath once in a televisionstation before I knew any ofthis and I never forgot the coldness of his eyes or howthey appeared to go onforever like two black holes. I have heard many peopledescribe a similarexperience with people they claim to have seen shape-shift. Thewoman told methat she had seen other reptilian figures in Burnham Beeches atdusk or afterdark, wearing long robes with hoods. You can see an artist'simpression of two ofthe reptilian forms she has seen in Figure 34.Shortly after I met her, I was introduced through a third party to thehealer,Christine Fitzgerald, a close confidant of Princess Diana for nine years.You can readthe full and amazing story of what she told me in The BiggestSecret, but I want tohold focus on the reptilian connection in this book.Christine Fitzgerald knewnothing whatsoever of my then unpublished reptilianresearch, but a little way into233Picture #72 [images/img_0072.png]Figure 34: An artist's impression of reptilians seen by the woman from BurnhamBeeches during a\"shape-shifting\" experience. One is very similar to the DarthMaul character in Star Wars and this imagewas drawn long before that movie wasproducedour conversation she told me that Diana called the Windsors \"the reptiles\" and\"thelizards”. Diana also used to say \"They're not human.\" Christine went on totell methat the Windsors were a reptilian hybrid bloodline and how they hadtreatedDiana in ways that were beyond the imagination. At the centre of thiscircle, shesaid, was the Queen Mother. Christine told me that Princess Dianaused to call theQueen Mother \"evil”. 1 can think of no one on this planet, maybeeven in history,whose real persona is more at odds with her manufactured imagethan the QueenMother. If people only knew the truth, those sickeningcelebrations to mark her100th birthday would never have happened. Christinesaid:\"The Queen Mother...now that's a serious piece of wizardry. The Queen Mother isa lotolder than people think. To be honest, the Royal Family hasn't died for along time, theyhave just metamorphosised. It's sort of cloning, but in adifferent way. They take piecesof flesh and rebuild the body from one littlebit. Because it's lizard, because it's cold-blooded, it's much easier to do thisFrankenstein shit than it is for us. The differentbodies are just differentelectrical vibrations and they have got that secret, they've gotthe secret ofthe micro-currents, it's so micro, so specific, these radio waves thatactuallycreate the bodies. These are the energies I work with when I'm healing.\"They know the vibration of life and because they're cold-blooded, they arereptiles,they have no wish to make the Earth the perfect harmony it could be, orto heal theEarth from the damage that's been done. The Earth's been attacked forzeons bydifferent extraterrestrials. It's been like a football for so long. Thisplace is a busstop for many different aliens. All these aliens, they could copewith anything,including the noxious gases. They're landing all the time andcoming up from thebowels of the Earth. They looked like reptiles originally, butthey look like us when234Children of the Matrixthey get out now through the electrical vibration, that key to life I talkedabout. Theycan manifest how they want to. All the real knowledge has been takenout andshredded and put back in another way. The Queen Mother is 'Chief Toad' ofthis partof Europe and they have people like her in every continent. Mostpeople, the hangerson, don't know, you know, about the reptiles. They are justin awe of these peoplebecause they are so powerful.\"2I know it is hard to imagine and grasp the scale of the QueenMother'sinvolvement through her life because your mind tells you she is a littleold lady. But,as with all of these people, what you see is just the front image,not the real being. Itis an extreme version of an agent in a foreign landoperating behind a cover story ofwhy he is there and what he is doing. It's justthat these people have \"cover bodies\",also. Christine Fitzgerald was able to seewhat was going on because of her workwith Diana and the aristocracy and herunderstanding of energy, vibrations, andfrequencies through her healing centre.I have had to study an unbelievable numberof subjects and research so manydifferent strands of information before it waspossible to put a picture togetherand that is one big reason why it has rarely come tolight like this before.There is so much to know before you can see how the pieces fittogether. TheIlluminati have suppressed all information that is necessary to see thepictureand you have to do so much work to overcome that. You also need a mindthat isfree (or free-er) and willing to go anywhere the evidence leads.A few weeks after my meeting with Christine Fitzgerald in 1999, myscientistfriend in California, Brian Desborough, told me there was a woman that1 had tomeet as soon as possible. This was Arizona Wilder, a recovering victimof themassive Illuminati mind control network, who had worked for them at a veryhighlevel. She said she had conducted sacrificial rituals as a \"Mother Goddess\"for theBritish royal family, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and at anotoriouscentre for Satanic ritual called the Mothers of Darkness Castle inBelgium. This islocated in the same region as the headquarters of the cultresponsible for thewidespread paedophilia, murder, and child sacrifice that cameto light amidenormous public anger in 1994. The ring involved famous pillars ofBelgian societyand a massive cover-up has ensued to keep it quiet. Belgium is amajor IlluminatiSatanic centre and that's why the European Union and NATO arebased there.Arizona Wilder's original name had been Jennifer Greene. She is ablue-eyed blondfrom a French aristocratic bloodline with significant Irishblood, too. When hermind and her memories began to return after the death of hercontroller, the Nazi,Josef Mengele, she changed her name to Arizona Wilder anddyed her hair to coverthe blond in an effort to break some of the programmingrelated to that.Illuminati mind controlUnderstanding the mind control network and its techniques is vital toappreciatethe ways that the reptilians manipulate human society. Josef Mengelewas the\"Angel of Death\" in the Nazi concentration camps, who performed thehorrificexperiments on twins and others. There he developed a technique calledtrauma-235based mind control in which they manipulated a mechanism of the mind thatshutsout memories of extreme trauma. This kicks in when people have a seriousroadaccident and can never remember the impact or the immediate aftermathbecausetheir mind puts an amnesic barrier around that memory. This means wedon't haveto keep reliving such a terrible event. My mother was hit by a car andsuffered someawful injuries a little while ago. To this day she cannot rememberfrom 30 secondsbefore impact until some 20 minutes after. On that level thismental defencemechanism is a good thing, but the Illuminati, particularlyMengele, perfected it fortheir own reasons. In fact, they have known about itfor thousands of years, it's justthat its widespread global use began to returnin the 20th century. It is known astrauma-based mind control and they takechildren before the age of five and six andput them through the mostunimaginable violent, sexual, and emotional abuse.Again they are chosen bybloodline. A lot of paedophile rings are set up andprotected to serve thisagenda, and when genuine people expose them, as in theNorth Wales scandal in theUK, the famous names involved are never allowed tocome to light. These namesinclude the paedophile Lord McAlpine of the famousBritish construction company.He is a former chairman of the Conservative Partyand heavily involved in secretsocieties like the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. Theunbelievable trauma thesechildren are subjected to, including Satanic ritual, splitsthe mind intocompartments - amnesic barriers that imprison the memories of thetrauma and donot allow them to enter the conscious mind. In the Illuminati mindcontrolcentres like the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London (seeTheBiggest Secret), these compartments are known as \"altars\". You might imagineamind broken into a honeycomb of self-contained compartments, eachholdingindividual memories of trauma. At the front of this honeycomb is the partthatdirectly interacts with the world. They call this the \"front altar\". This iscompletelyunaware that all the other compartments exist and those compartmentsareunaware of each other. Therefore, the front altar, the one we take to be the\"real\"person, has no memory of what has happened to them, or what is still being done,until the barriers begin to break down and the memories they contain can enterthefront altar, the conscious mind.Using hypnotic keys and triggers, mind controllers like Mengele movethesedifferent compartments around, pushing the front altar into the unconsciousandbringing forward one of the back altars. The victim is then sexually abusedby afamous person, like George Bush or Ted Heath for instance, or programmedtocarry out a future assassination or task. Afterwards that altar is returned tothe non-conscious mind and the front altar, oblivious of what has just happened,is broughtforward again. Those programmed for assassinations will not have aclue what hasbeen done to them. Their assassination programme, to kill a famousperson or\"dangerous\" researcher, will lie dormant in the compartment until thetrigger isgiven. This could be a word, phrase, or sound. When that happens, thedormantcompartment swaps places with the front altar, takes control of the body,andcarries out its programming. This is the true background to the mass killerslikeThomas Hamilton (Dunblane, Scotland), Martin Bryant (Port Arthur, Tasmania),236Children of the Matrixand the stream of similar cases in the United States, including ColumbineHighSchool, where \"crazed\" people have slaughtered the innocent, or at leastbeenblamed for it. They are programmed \"multiples\" given a cover \"personality\"andbackground of being \"strange\", which can then be used to dismiss the murdersasthe act of \"nutters\".It is no accident that Timothy McVeigh, the man convicted for theOklahomabombing, was, according to the USA Today newspaper, given a\"mentalassessment\" after his arrest by a man called Louis Jolyon West, apsychiatrist at theUniversity of California. What the paper did not say was thatWest is one of themost notorious CIA mind controllers in America and theUniversity of California isone of the leading mind control centres. It was Westwho made a \"mentalassessment\" of Patty Hearst of the famous newspaper dynastywhen she came outof the Symbionese Liberation Army. This was a terrorist gang inCalifornia in the1970s and a creation of the Illuminati. In ...And The TruthShall Set You Free, youcan read the evidence that McVeigh was not the man behindthe bombing. But afterhis \"assessment\" by West, and no doubt a list ofthreatened consequences, he offeredan almost non-existent defence when a verysubstantial one could have been mounted.The government appointed his lawyer.Later McVeigh conveniently asked to beexecuted. The reason for horrors likeOklahoma and the mass shootings, and whythey are increasing, is to traumatisethe collective mind and justify legislation ofmany kinds. More basic freedomswere removed from American society in responseto Oklahoma, and Bill Clintoncalled for an \"easing of restrictions of the military'sinvolvement in domesticlaw enforcement\". This is the technique I have calledproblem-reaction-solution.Covertly create the problem, get the public to scream\"something must be done\",and then openly offer the solutions to the problems youhave created. Solutionsthat advance your agenda. One aim of the mass shootings isthe removal of gunsfrom public circulation. I don't believe in violence of any kind,but theIlluminati know that many people have no problem using guns to protectthemselvesand they want as many weapons as possible out of circulation by thetime theirmasters are openly revealed and their fascist state is in place. AdolfHitlerintroduced gun laws before he began to fill concentration camps.People subjected to trauma-based mind control suffer from what is calledMultiplePersonality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Someare nowbeginning to recover memories of their trauma and involvement in theIlluminatiprojects and who is behind them. Some very famous names are coming tolight withcompelling consistency - George Bush, Henry Kissinger, Dick Cheney, A1Gore, theBritish royal family, the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and a long list ofothersdocumented in my other books. This is why the False MemorySyndromeFoundation was hurriedly created to discredit the memories that thesevictims arenow having. It is a gigantic cover-up, which, as usual, the media hasbought hook,line, and sinker. Claiming the victim is suffering from \"falsememory\" is now theeasiest way for those accused of abusing children to walk freefrom the courts andthe media reports these cases as if those accused are thevictims. Are some peoplefalsely accused though malice? Yes, of course that isgoing to happen from time to237time. But are most of these cases untrue. No way. Just look at some of thepeoplebehind the creation of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. The leadinglightswere Ralph Underwager, a Lutheran Minister and psychologist fromMinnesota,and his wife, Flollida Wakefield. Underwager has been called as an\"expert\" witnessin child abuse cases. This is the same couple who wereinterviewed in the winter1993 edition of the Dutch paedophile magazine, Paedika,and were supportive ofpaedophilia! (seehttp://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/NudistFIallofShame/Underwager2.html). Alsoinvolved with the creation of the False Memory SyndromeFoundation were Pamelaand Peter Freyd, who present themselves as falsely accusedparents. Theirdaughter Jennifer Freyd is now Professor of Psychology at theUniversity ofOregon. She is adamant that her accusations of parental abuse are trueand shehas spoken out against the motives and methods of the False MemorySyndromeFoundation (see http://www.movingforward.org/v2n5-biiTell.html forsome furtherbackground from a friend of Jennifer Freyd). Shirley and Paul Eberleare two more\"experts\" who spend their time rubbishing claims of child abuse,Satanism, andrecovered memories on behalf of the Foundation. They wrote ThePolitics Of ChildAbuse, a book that accuses mothers, mental health professionals, andprosecutorsof feeding children stories about sexual abuse. Since then they have beencalledas \"experts\" in abuse trials. But their real expertise appears toinvolverunning, and contributing to, pornography magazines (see article by MariaLaurinaat http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/NudistHallofShame/Eberle.html).TheEberles edit a soft-core magazine in California called the L.A. Star, whichcontainspromotion for their book The Politics Of Child Abuse. In the 1970s theywere alsoinvolved in hard-core pornography with a magazine called Finger. TheEberles werefeatured nude on one cover holding two life-size blow-up dolls named\"Love Girl\"and \"Play Guy\". Donald Smith, a sergeant with the obscenity sectionof the LosAngeles Police Department's vice division, followed the couple foryears. The policewere never able to prosecute for child pornography, but Smithsaid: \"There were alot of photos of people who looked like they were under agebut we could neverprove it.” Among the articles that appeared in Finger were\"Sexpot at Five”, \"MyFirst Rape, She Was Only Thirteen\", and \"What Happens WhenNiggers AdoptWhite Children\". One letter to the magazine says: \"I think it'sreally great that yourmags have the courage to print articles and pixs on childsex... Too bad I didn't hearfrom more women who are into child sex ...Since I'msingle I'm not getting it onwith my children, but I know of a few families thatare. If I were married and mywife and kids approved, I'd be having sex with mydaughters.\" Another says: \"I'm apedophile and I think it's great a man is havingsex with his daughter! ...Since Ididn't get Finger #3, I didn't get to see thestories and pics of family sex. Would liketo see pics of nude girls making itwith their daddy, but realize it's too risky toprint.” The Eberles have sinceproduced a further book for their \"family friend\",Carole Stuart (of publishersLyle Stuart), in which they dismiss all claims of childabuse in the famousMcMartin pre-school case, which I will outline in a later chapter.Yeah, theFalse Memory Syndrome Foundation is certainly to be trusted and has thebestinterests of child at heart. Any real journalists reading this?238Children of the MatrixA former Illuminati mind controller told me how they have theirplacementhroughout psychiatry and key \"education\" establishments in general toensure thatthe lid stays on. She said that the George Washington Universitycampus was a\"hotbed\" of Illuminati professors and teachers when she wasoperating in the 1970s.She said that a Dr Timothy Brogan, her main Illuminati\"trainer\", was a behaviouralscientist on the faculty. This is also affiliated,she said, with one of the mainpaediatric neurological specialty groups in theUS, which researched braindevelopment and manipulation. At night, she said, theywere experimenting withbrain wave programming on the children who were takenthere. This formerIlluminati source told me that Brogan was a co-founder ofDELPHI, the Illuminati\"head trainer's group\" in the United States and thepartner to ORACLE, the maintraining group in Europe. With this network ofIlluminati agents working inpsychiatry and medicine, they can (a) do theirexperimentation and trauma-basedmind control undiscovered and (b) produceendless \"eminent\" professors ofpsychiatry and therapy to tell the media and thecourts that Multiple PersonalityDisorder does not exist and that the memories ofendless people telling the samestories and naming the same names are \"false\".Arizona Wilder is one of those who are breaking down the compartmentsandremembering their unimaginable experiences. In The Biggest Secret and thevideoRevelations Of A Mother Goddess, she tells her story in detail and namesthe famousnames involved on both sides of the Atlantic. She says she was chosenbecause ofher bloodline. The Illuminati-reptilians literally breed bloodlines toconduct theirrituals for them. The people of these bloodlines are very psychicand able to connecteasily with energy, and therefore manipulate its vibrationalstate or draw desiredfrequencies into rituals. Blond-haired, blue-eyed peopleturn up again and again inthese bloodlines. From the moment a child of these\"psychic\" bloodlines is born, infact even in the womb, they are subjected totrauma-based mind control. The idea isto turn them into compartmentalised peoplewho can be \"triggered\" to conduct therituals as programmed, but then \"forget\"everything they did until thatcompartment is accessed again for the next ritual.Unfortunately for the Illuminati,Arizona's compartments began to break downafter the death of her controller, JosefMengele, in the 1980s. Although anotherinfamous mind controller, Guy deRothschild, was brought in to \"take her over\",it did not work. This often happensbecause the victim's mind worships the onewho originally programmed them,especially if it was over a long period of time.When 1 met her, Arizona had escapedfrom mind control, though there were manycompartments still to be accessed, andBrian Desborough was helping her with thatpainstaking task.Clinton, Gore, and the elite satanistsSupport for Arizona's theme comes from Phillip Eugene de Rothschild,anotherrecovering mind-controlled Satanist, who tells part of his story on anexcellentwebsite highlighting ritual abuse and mind control.3 After I contactedhim, we havealso communicated directly on several occasions. Phillip, who usesanother name indaily life, explains how his front altar or \"presenter\"personality was that of a\"good guy\" Christian, but beyond that he was programmed as a Satanist astheunofficial son of a French Rothschild. His mother was Lula Vieta PaulineRussellCampbell, who was born in 1917 in Farmersville, Texas, and died in 1977.But, hesays, his real, biological, father, was not the man he had known as hisfather beforehis compartmentalised mind began to heal and remember. His geneticfather, hesays, was Baron Philippe de Rothschild of the Mouton-Rothschild wineproducingestates in France, who died in 1988 at the age of 86 (see picturesection). PhillipEugene told me: \"My father was a decadent dilettante as well asa master Satanistand hater of God, but how he loved the fields and the wines. Heused to say itbrought out \"the primitive\" in him. The estates are now run byBaron Philippe'sdaughter, Baroness Philippine, who, Phillip Eugene says, is hishalf sister. He was,he writes, conceived by \"occult incest\" and was \"one of thehundreds of thousandsof both legitimate and illegitimate offspring of thispowerful financial and occultfamily\". Much of this is done artificially throughIlluminati sperm banks. WhatPhillip says is confirmation of my own research, asoutlined in The Biggest Secret,that the main reptilian bloodlines conceivecountless children to perpetuate thebloodline and only a few are given thebloodline name as \"official\" children. Theothers are hidden behind other namesand brought up by other \"parents\". Laterthey find themselves in significantpositions, often not knowing why they got so\"lucky”. But their bloodline allowsthem to be more easily possessed by the fourth-dimensional entities and byplacing these bloodlines in power they are really givingthat power to thefourth-dimensional reptilians and other entities. Phillip Eugenesays that formost of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his Rothschildfather on hisestate in France. They had a physical relationship, he says, and he was\"heldfast in the emotional power of incest, which, in this culture, was \"normal\"and\"to be admired\". He said he observed his Rothschild father's \"lust for power\"andbegan to desire the same. He also confirmed the way the \"occult\" bloodlinesarecontrolled by demonic entities. \"Being a Rothschild descendant\", he said, \"Iwasmaximally demonised.” He continues:\"I was present at my father's death in 1988, receiving his power and thecommissionto carry out my destiny in the grand conspiracy of my family. Liketheir other children,I played a key role in my family's revolt from God. When Iwatch CNN, it startles meto see so many familiar faces now on the world stage inpolitics, art, finance,fashion, and business. I grew up with these peoplemeeting them at ritual worshipsites and in the centers of power. Financiers,artists, royalty, and even Presidents, allthese dissociated people work andconspire today to bring in a new worldorder...These people, like me, are SRA/DID[Satanically ritually abused andDissociative Identity Disorder- 'multiples'.]\"The last non-dissociative President of the United States was DwightEisenhower;except for him, every one since Teddy Roosevelt has had some level ofdissociativedisorder and some level of involvement in the occult. PresidentClinton has 'fullblown' multiple personality disorder and is an active sorcererin the Satanic mystery240Children of the Matrixreligions. This is true of Al Gore, as well; I have known Misters Clinton andGorefrom our childhood as active and effective Satanists.\"Like the hundreds of thousands of this [Rothschild] occult family's otherbiologicalchildren, I had my place and function within this clan's attempt tocontrol the world.My efforts and my family's efforts strove to have a member ofthe European nobilityof the Habsburg family assume the pre-eminent position overhumanity, a positioncalled the Antichrist by Christianity. While others wereseeded into government,academia, business, or entertainment, my place was withinthe Body of Christ. I wasto be a focus for spiritual power and controller of acult within this Church. In thisChurch have lived people who I have known all mylife to be the controllers and powercenters of both the Rothschild family'sfalse prophet and the antichrist.\"Many dissociated Christians in the Body of Christ hold similar corporatespiritual,occult positions as part of the Satanic New World Order. In my being Iembodied theLuciferian morning star within the Church. I represented thepresence of all the otherSatanists who were related to me in the morning star;their spirits were present in mein the Church. Constructed through ritual butempowered by legions of spirits, I was ahuman and spiritual focus of corporateSatanic energy into the 'Body of Christ.'\"4Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, like Arizona Wilder, talks of the involvementofJosef Mengele, and the overwhelming memory that most of his victims have ishiseyes. \"I'll never forget his eyes\", they say, one after the other. Havinglooked intothe eyes of Ted Heath, who is nowhere near as high in the hierarchyas Mengelewas, I know exactly what they mean. Phillip de Rothschild says he sawMengelegiving a \"tongue-lashing\" to his Rothschild father and this confirms myownresearch that shape-shifter Mengele was very high indeed in the Illuminati.I'm surethere are those who will be extremely surprised by the claim that longafter the warJosef Mengele, the \"Angel of Death\" in Nazi Germany, programmedArizonaWilder, in America. In ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I present thedocumentedfact that all \"sides\" in the First and Second World Wars were fundedby the sameIlluminati sources. Wars are highly effective ways to advance thereptilian agendaand that's why we have so many of them. They create enormousfear, kill vastnumbers of people, force countries into massive debt to theIlluminati bankers, andchange the face of a society forever. But you also needto protect your key personnelfrom the consequences of their actions in thosewars and this is what happenedwith Mengele, and the other leading Nazigeneticists, mind controllers, scientists,and engineers. They escaped fromGermany as the Allies arrived thanks to a Britishand American intelligenceoperation called Project Paperclip. This has even beenoccasionally exposed evenin the mainstream media here and there. A Germantelevision documentary in late2000 exposed the secret life of a former Nazi warcriminal, who spied forAmerica's Central Intelligence Agency after the SecondWorld War in return for afake Jewish identity.5 He was Gunter Reinemer, an SSlieutenant who commandeddeath squads at the Treblinka concentration camp. Hewas responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Jews. The documentary said thathewas given the identity Hans-Georg Wagner by the CIA. He later married aJewishwoman, lived in Israel and was buried in a Jewish cemetery. His storymight havebeen buried with him had he not felt the need to confess in 1988,shortly before heapparently committed suicide. His statements formed the basisof the documentaryWagner's Confession. He says that after agreeing to work forthe CIA he spentseveral months at a US military base at Frankfurt-Hochst, wherehe learnedrudimentary intelligence techniques and was circumcised. He was givena Jewishidentity and sent as a Holocaust survivor to Calbe, East Germany, wherehe spiedon old Nazis and new communist technologies at the local power plant.Reinemerwas small fry compared with people like Mengele, but his is one exampleofProject Paperclip and its offshoots. How many other Illuminati Nazis havebeenmasquerading as \"Jewish\" since the war, one wonders? Mengele was taken toSouthAmerica and the United States where one of his main bases was the ChinaLakeNaval Weapons Center in the California desert. It was he who mastermindedthenotorious and publicly acknowledged CIA mind control project calledMKUltra.MK stood for mind control, but they used the German spelling Kontrolle,becauseof the Nazis who created it with funding provided through people likeJohn FosterDulles, the US Secretary of State, and his brother, Allen Dulles, thefirst head of theCIA and the man President Kennedy had sacked before hisassassination. Dulleslater served on the Warren Commission \"investigation\",which decided that LeeHarvey Oswald was the lone assassin! According to oneresearcher, ULTRA is thename for a very high-security classification dealingwith alien interaction and asecret arm of the US National Security Agencydealing with the same subject. Itoperates a joint alien-\"human\" network in anunderground base in the notoriousDulce-Los Alamos area of New Mexico, and isalso the name of a secret Nazi teamin the Second World War that handled securityfor an alleged German undergroundbase in Antarctica. You may recall thatresearcher Maurice Doreal claims to haveseen evidence that the reptilians wereonce based in an ice-free Antarctica duringtheir high-tech wars with theNordics.Shape-shifting queensArizona Wilder told me how she had conducted sacrificial rituals involvingtheBritish royal family, Tony Blair, and famous American Illuminati names likeGeorgeBush, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger and many others.\" Thehighestoperative she knew in the Illuminati, she said, was a guy calling himselftheMarquis de Libeaux (\"of the water\"). His codename was Pindar, which shesaysmeans \"penis of the dragon\". Arizona told me how the Queen and QueenMotherregularly sacrifice babies and adults at many ritual centres, includingBalmoralCastle in Scotland, where they were all staying at the time Diana wasrituallymurdered in Paris. The royal family involved in human sacrifice wasfantasticenough, but here again came the constantly repeated theme. Shedescribed how,during the rituals, these people shape-shift into reptiles. DianeGould, head of theUS organisation, Mothers Against Ritual Abuse, also confirmsthis theme. In a242Children of the Matrixtelephone conversation about ritual abuse, Diane asked me if I could explain whymany of her clients reported that participants in their rituals had turned intoreptiles. People might want to dismiss all this, but they should know that,whilethey close their eyes and their minds, children are being sacrificed all overtheworld this very day by the reptilian bloodlines - many thousands of them onthemain ritual dates. Arizona talked about some of her experiences with theQueenand Queen Mother:\"The Queen Mother was cold, cold, cold, a nasty person. None of her cohortseventrusted her. They have named an altar [mind-control programme] after her.They call itthe Black Queen. I have seen her sacrifice people. I remember herpushing a knife intosomeone's rectum the night that two boys were sacrificed.One was 13 and the other18. You need to forget that the Queen Mother appears tobe a frail old woman. Whenshe shape-shifts into a reptilian, she becomes verytall and strong. Some of them areso strong they can rip out a heart and they allgrow by several feet when they shape-shift [This is what the lady said who sawEdward Heath, among endless others.]\"Of the Queen, Arizona said:\"I have seen her sacrifice people and eat their flesh and drink their blood. Onetimeshe got so excited with blood-lust that she didn't cut the victim's throatfrom left toright in the normal ritual, she just went crazy, stabbing andripping at the flesh aftershe had shape-shifted into a reptilian. When sheshape-shifts, she has a long reptileface, almost like a beak and she's anoff-white colour. [This fits many depictions ofthe gods and \"bird gods\" ofancient Egypt and elsewhere.] The Queen Mother looksbasically the same, butthere are differences. She [the Queen] also has like bumpson her head and hereyes are very frightening. She's very aggressive...\"...I have seen [Prince Charles] shape-shift into a reptilian and do all thethings theQueen does. I have seen him sacrifice children. There is a lot ofrivalry between themfor who gets to eat what part of the body and who gets toabsorb the victim's lastbreath and steal their soul. I have also seen Andrewparticipate and I have seenPrince Philip and Charles' sister (Anne) at therituals, but they didn't participate whenI was there. When Andrew shape-shifts,he looks more like one of the lizards. Theroyals are some of the worst, OK, asfar as enjoying the killing, enjoying the sacrifice,and eating the flesh,they're some of the worst of all of them. They don't care if yousee it. Who areyou going to tell, who is going to believe you? They feel that istheirbirthright and they love it. They love it.\"7Arizona has been viciously attacked for what she said in The Biggest Secretandon her video. A campaign of character assassination has been waged, at onetimealmost daily on the Internet, to discredit her evidence and the reptilianconnectionin general. Among the critics who have dismissed her information isthe publisherof Nexus magazine, which gives so much unchallenged space to SirLaurence243Gardner, publicist for the Imperial Royal Dragon Court and Order.Anothervehement critic of Arizona is a researcher who appeared for severalmonths tospend his entire day on the Internet trying to undermine the content ofThe BiggestSecret and especially Arizona's contribution. His desire to discreditthe idea of thereptilian connection to the Illuminati took on the appearance ofa raging obsessionand persuaded many people who should have known better todismiss all that shesaid. One of the points made to undermine Arizona's claimswas that victims ofmultiple personality disorder have a photographic memory andArizona did nothave that because there were names she did not immediatelyremember in thevideo. This revealed a fundamental lack of understanding of mindcontrol. The backaltars that hold the memories of trauma have photographicrecall because the mindalways records anything surrounding trauma incrystal-clear detail. But the frontaltar, the one doing the video interview, isnot photographic because it has notexperienced the trauma. It is the interfacewith the world and it there as a cover forall the other compartments to suppressthe memories of abuse. It only accessesthose memories when the compartmentsbegin to break down. Because the criticsdid not seem to understand that, theyused this lack of knowledge to ridicule whatshe said. The attacks made herwonder why on earth she bothered to go publicwhen those claiming to be seekingthe \"truth\" treated her in this way. However, asthe months have passed, evidencegathered from sources all over the world haspointed again and again to theaccuracy of Arizona's theme. I had people telling me\"she's crazy\", \"she's anIlluminati plant\", and \"don't believe her\". Yet many ofthose same people are nowaccepting the foundations of what Arizona was saying(and they were dismissing)in 1999. Arizona is an immensely brave woman and oneof the few who will speakopenly about her experiences. Most keep quiet becausethey think no one willbelieve them or they want to remain publicly anonymousbecause they fear theconsequences of speaking out. The critics try to present theidea that my onlysource for the reptilian shape-shifters is Arizona Wilder. Again, abreathtakingsuggestion when you look at the evidence. And I would stress herethat for everyperson I name, like Arizona, there are many, many, more who confirmthe story onthe understanding that their identity and location will not be revealedpublicly,although I know the details.One such case is a 57-year-old former chief of police, special agent, andmemberof the US military. He says he has guarded two presidents, two SecretariesofDefense, and two chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the head of the USmilitary).He contacted me just as this book was being completed to say that heknows fromhis experience that \"aliens exist\" and that the government is lyingabout theRoswell \"alien\" crash in New Mexico in 1947. He also told me of a\"crystal skull\" inhis possession. But his main reason for making contact was totell me of an incidentthat showed to him that shape-shifting reptilians arereal. When he arrived at afriend's house in Texas, he was told that two womenguests were coming from NewYork. They travelled around the country performinghands on healing and they hadasked if they could drop by, he was told. Thisformer chief of police told me inpersonal correspondence what happened next:244Children of the Matrix\"Well I arrived before the New York people and had already started showingmycrystal skull when they arrived. They immediately went crazy [because of theskull]and started holding their hands up before their eyes and screamed 'Get herout ofhere' over and over. I can tell you that everyone was shocked by theiractions and Iwas extremely upset ...I carried the crystal skull out to the carand left it there. Afterabout an hour everyone seemed to get over the uproarthey made and things settleddown to discussions. Everyone introduced themselvesand the two from New Yorkvolunteered to heal someone. Well everyone startedtelling them to do it to mebecause I had heart trouble and was recovering from aheart attack. I hesitated, butfinally relented and said OK.\"They sprang over to me so fast that it startled me. One got behind me andonestraddled my legs in front of me. They did this without touching me and theybothstarted running their hands around my body again without touching meanywhere.This went on for about a minute then my eyes met the eyes of the ladyin front of me.That was some experience, our eyes meeting. Pay attention to whatI say here. Icould see immediately that she knew that I knew and it broke herconcentration. Shelost control and changed into a reptilian right before myeyes. No sooner than shelost control, she regained it and shape-shifted backinto a human. All this took placein the blink of an eye. They immediately jumpedup and said that they had to leaveand left within 30 seconds of this happening.\"He said he did not say anything about what he had seen, but when everyonebeganto leave, two guests stayed behind and would not move. Eventually theyasked:\"Did you see what we saw?\" He asked them what they meant and they saidthey hadseen the lady \"...change into a reptile and then change back\". People alloverthe world, and from countless walks of life, have repeated this sameexperienceto me. This is the modern version of the experience the ancientsconstantlydescribed.A regular source of information about reptilian activities and rituals arethosewho have been involved in \"religious\" organisations, not least theJehovah'sWitnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints (LDS),better knownas the Mormons. A lady called Diana Huston told me of herexperiences in theJehovah's Witnesses, which is officially titled the WatchtowerBible and TractSociety.8 She joined them in 1969 because, after going throughthe Vietnam War withher husband, she was attracted by the message of paradise onEarth. She was OKfor a few years, but then they became more demanding andcontrolling. In 1987 shesaid that subliminal drawings began to appear in theartwork of their books andmagazines depicting bizarre faces and strangemessages. Some of these are detailedin the Symbolism Archives on my website(www.davidicke.com). At a smallconvention in September 1988, she spoke privatelyto one of the governing body'elect'. At that time she thought they were the\"good guys\". The man was about5'10\" with dark hair and was powerfully built. Shesaid that she looked into his eyesand was startled and terrified to see a thinmembrane drop over his human eyes.She didn't know if the membrane came from the bottom of his eyelid or thetop.\"I'd never heard of lizard beings, but I remember thinking how much hiseyeslooked like those of a lizard,\" she recalled. The membrane dropped over hiseyeswhen he looked at her and he seemed to recognise her, although at the timeshecouldn't imagine why. The sense of terrible danger that she felt, and theneed to getaway from him, was overwhelming. She went on:\"Eventually I came to understand that the leaders are not fully human, but aretheoffspring of something alien to this Earth. They are too cunning, lethal, andintelligentto have originated from here, and there has to be an over-race ofbeings guiding themfrom some dimension. They are here for one reason only. Theylook at humans as asource of enslavement for their enjoyment to torment andabuse, to misuse powerand to cruelly punish and kill.\"As she researched the religion's documents and books, she said she begantouncover a frail of arms and drug-running (which the Illuminati globallycontrols),and \"plots to destroy the world and take it for their own\". Diane tookher\"mountains\" of evidence to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and metwiththem. They said that she was either a genius or totally insane. She said shelearnedthat the Watchtower Society had hidden rooms under the streets ofBrooklyn, NewYork, where they have their headquarters over the now-abandoned oldBrooklynsubway. There they practise Satanic ritual, including the sacrifice ofhuman infants,she said, and here they also keep women who are used as \"breeders\"for babies tobe sacrificed. This happens all over the world because the babiesare never officiallyregistered and therefore never reported missing. To thesystem, they have neverexisted. The main Illuminati bloodlines conceive childrenin the rituals, also. Dianewrote that this Watchtower Satanic operation istotally self-sufficient and even usesblood in the ink of the magazines. She saidthat she and a friend tried to warnpeople through the media with no success (Iam surprised!) and her friend had anervous breakdown from which she has neverfully recovered.One of a number of accounts to come from former members of the Mormon\"Church\"was sent by a woman who claims she suffered in a Mormon mind controlproject fromthe time she was a young child. Cathy O'Brien says that the MormonChurch andespecially the operation at Salt Lake City is a major mind control centre.Formermilitary sources claim that the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, which iscoveredin Illuminati symbols like the all-seeing eye, stands over a largeundergroundreptilian base that can be accessed from the temple site. This woman, Iwill callher Jane, said that she saw her babies sacrificed in Mormon rituals. Inherpursuit of the truth, she spoke with another victim of ritual abuse by theMormonand Roman Catholic Church. This other lady told her that the Mormon\"Prophet\"had taken her baby from her at a ritual and eaten it. Two other womenraised asCatholics told her that they had seen the abusers shape-shift intoreptilians and eata human sacrifice. Jane said that Joseph Smith, the founder ofthe Mormons, wasfrom \"the occult bloodlines\" (very true) and the whole officialstory was a lie. \"The246Children of the Matrixleaders are mostly reptilian,\" she said. \"One witness says that only one ofthetwelve [Mormon] apostles did not shape shift at the ritual.\" She goes on:\"I was so mad to find out that the alien abuse was connected to the ritual abuseinthe church when I had believed the church was true. [Now I know that]...ourfamiliesare from occult bloodlines of England and Europe. This has gone on forhundreds andthousands of years.\"9For certain, Satanic ritual goes on within the Mormon Church. In fact thenumberof accounts has ensured that even the Mormon hierarchy has had to admitit goeson. What they do deny, however, is the scale on which it happens and that itgoesright to the top. In fact, it is orchestrated from there. There are a numberofwebsites exposing this, including a site set up by former Mormons, one of whomisthe same bloodline as the Mormon hero Brigham Young.10Rothschild-Bauer-BushThe connection between the hybrid bloodlines and shape-shifting isconstantlyconfirmed. Here is one excellent example. The Rothschilds are anAnunnaki shape-shifting bloodline and before they changed their name to \"RedShield\" when theRothschild banking dynasty began in Frankfurt, Germany, theywere called Bauer.And the Bauers were a notorious \"occult\" family of Middle-AgesGermany. Theword \"Roth\" also developed into Roads, Rhoads, or Rhodes, the nameof CecilRhodes, the infamous Rothschild placeman who brought devastation andgenocideto southern Africa. On Rhodes' immense memorial in Cape Town, SouthAfrica,there are lines of lions - a symbol of the serpent cult/Illuminati.Another reptilianbloodline is the Bush family in the United States, which hasprovided two of the lastthree US Presidents. Father George has been namedperhaps more than anyonewhen people recount their shape-shifting experiences. Ishould stress that I am notsaying that everyone called Bauer or Bush throughoutthe world is like this.Certainly not. I am talking of these Anunnaki bloodlinesthat have taken the nameBauer and Bush. I was sent a letter to my website from asource that did not wishhis name to be published. It pulls together the namesBauer (Rothschild) and Bushin one story. Before you read it, you need to knowthat FEMA, the FederalEmergency Management Agency in the United States, is amajor Illuminatioperation. It will take control of every aspect of Americanlife, by law, whenever thePresident calls a State of Emergency. Anyway, here isa fascinating story connectingFEMA, the Rothschild /Bauer and Bush bloodlines,and shape-shifting:\"A few years ago I became acquainted with a lovely person with the surnameofBauer. We had many varied and wide-ranging discussions. During one of thesetalks,the subject of schizophrenia came up. She said it ran in her family.Asking for moredetail, she told me her mother and great aunt had been afflictedby it. It was thevision hallucination type. The odd thing is that thehallucinations were incrediblysimilar. Their 'hallucinations' were of people \"ofRoyal blood' turning into giant lizards!247\"I was at FEMA training headquarters in Fredricksburg, Maryland, attendingaradiological defence pilot course in 1982 for the Washington State DepartmentofEmergency Services. During the orientation, Louis Guiffreda, one of theheadhonchos and a cousin of George Bush, came in to observe. When he sat downInoticed a dark haze around him. I kept looking at him to see if my eyes wereplayingtricks on me, but it stayed the same. I was up in the seats alone, as Ilike to be inthese things. Soon, I noticed he was staring at me! This unnervedme. I closed myeyes and tried to relax. When I opened my eyes again, I saw himcoming toward me.He sat down a few rows behind and to the left of me. I glancedback and saw himleaning forward with his eyes closed. I figured he was justtired and decided totake a rest with me.\"While sitting there trying to relax, I heard a strange hissing and swishingsoundcome from behind me. I opened my eyes, but was afraid to look around. I sawawoman in our group looking up in our direction with a look of astonishment andshockon her face. She kept looking up nervously in our direction. Eventually,Guiffreda leftwith his bodyguards (waxy-faced suits with sunglasses) and thepresentationcontinued. After the orientation, I walked outside and found thiswoman sobbing andshaking in the arms of another participant. I intruded and saidI wanted to know whyshe was looking up with that look on her face. She didn'twant to say, but withrepeated assurance from me she told me. She had seenGuiffreda 'turn' into a lizard!The other guy said Guiffreda had the nickname oflizard man in the circles aroundFEMA and he has a skin disease that makes hisskin look like scales.\"I had forgotten about this experience until I read David's book. It was justone of thoseodd things that didn't make sense. Now it does...l was in quite abit of shock when Ifinally made all the connections. So, what more can I say? Idon't just believe it's real, I'know' it is. Unless, of course, I want to denymy own experience and senses.\"11Sex and the shape-shiftersHere is another example of the way the bloodline names come up all the timewiththe stories of shape-shifting. As 1 mentioned earlier, members of theOppenheimerfamily are the bloodline branch managers for the Illuminatireptilians in SouthAfrica and this is a story from a correspondent there:\"I was born in South Africa and years ago got to know an old lady inJohannesburgwho had for many years been the lover of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, thefounder [withRothschild backing] of the gold and diamond corporate cartel. Shetold me that SirErnest used to visit her in the afternoons at her flat inParktown. On one occasion asthey were about to make love, his body took on theform and proportions of a giantlizard with scales and she said the experiencehad been one of the sexual highlightsof her life. The story which was so strangeat the time has been in the back of mymind for years and came back to me when Irecently read your book.\"12248Children of the MatrixSexual activity seems to be a time when shape-shifting can happen asthehormones, blood, and energy are affected dramatically. A businesswomaninCanada told me of her reptilian experiences. The first was with a Portuguesemanwho treated her terribly and she was little more than an imprisoned slave.She saidhe shape-shifted into a reptile. She described how he was stunninglyritualistic,even with the time and day of the month he washed his clothes. Shelater had arelationship with another guy who, she said, was nice on the surface,but had avery dark side he was constantly battling with. She bought The BiggestSecret whenit was first published because it exposes in great detail thereptilian story she hadexperienced. One time when they went into her bedroom thebook was lying on ashelf above the bed. The man became very wound up and took aserious aversionto it, she told me. When they began to have sex, she said hebegan to go crazy,becoming violent and rough, and amid this anger, he began toshape-shift into areptile. Her hand was on the bottom of his back while he layon top of her and shefelt her hand being pushed up as the guy began to sprout atail! She screamed,threw him off, and he began to switch back to \"human” form.She told him toget out of the house immediately and, at the time 1 met her, shehad neverseen him since.A Los Angeles jazz singer, Pamela Stonebrooke, has spoken publicly abouthersexual encounters with a reptilian being and the last I heard she was in theprocessof producing a book on the subject. When the very tall reptilian firstappeared in herbedroom, she says she was terrified. The being forced her to havesex and seemedto get \"high\" on her fear, but she says that as these encounterscontinued sheconquered her fear and started coming on to him! When her fearsubsided, thereptilian did not seem to be so keen anymore. Pamela considers herreptilianexperience positive overall and talks of a close connection with thebeing. Butreports of women being raped by reptilians are far from rare. 1 metPamela briefly ata conference in Los Angeles and she is quite a character, verystrong willed, andthat's just what you need in these circumstances. She wrote anopen letter to the\"UFO community\" (most of whom are depressingly closed-mindedto seeingbeyond their own \"official line\"):\"Reptilians are not a politically correct species in the UFO community, and toadmit tohaving sex with one - much less enjoying it - is beyond the pale as faras the moreconservative members of that community are concerned. But I know frommyextensive reading and research, and from talking personally to dozens ofotherwomen (and men), that I am not unique in reporting this kind of experience.I am thefirst to admit that this is a vastly complex subject, a kind of hall ofmirrors, wheredimensional realities are constantly shifting and changing.Certainly, the reptiliansuse sex to control people in various ways.\"They have the ability to shape-shift and to control the mind of theexperiencer, aswell as to give tremendous pleasure through their mental powers.I have wrestledwith all of these implications and the various levels of meaningand possibilitiesServing the dragon: the present (I)249represented by my encounter experiences, i will say, however, as I have saidbefore,that I feel a deep respect for the reptilian entity with whom Iinteracted, and aprofound connection with this being.\"13She says that since she began to talk publicly of her experiences, she hasbeencontacted by hundreds of people telling her of similar encounters withreptilianentities. Credo Mutwa tells of the scores of African women he has metwho havereported the same experience of being forced to have sex with areptilian or havebeen artificially impregnated during abduction experiences onlyfor the resultingpregnancy to end suddenly when the foetus \"disappeared\" with noexplanation.Most women stay silent because of the obvious public ridicule thatwould followand whatever people may think about Pamela Stonebrooke, she has thevery\"couldn't-give-a-shit” attitude that is vital to making suppressedinformationknown to the wider public. In fact, here we have a golden example ofthe wayhumanity polices itself and, in doing so, suppresses the very informationthatwould give us a fix on what is really going on. I have experienced it myselffor 11years. When you say anything that is different to the norm, the masseseitherridicule or condemn you without doing any research whatsoever to establishifwhat you say could be valid. They dismiss it and often direct their bile atthemessenger for no other reason than it is different to what they havebeenprogrammed to believe. The media, as an expression of the collective mind,andvice-versa, takes the same line. Pathetic.Most people when faced with the truth, or a more accurate version of events,justlaugh in its face or condemn it as evil. Even those who have opened up tosomeaspects of the truth still can't expand their mind to encompass theexplodingevidence of the reptilian dimension. One writer, in an otherwise veryinterestingbook about ancient extraterrestrials, acknowledges all the serpentsymbolism,names, and references surrounding the Anunnaki, but suggests that thiscould havebeen because they wore reptile clothing or kept snakes. 1 think thereis anotherreason, somehow.SOURCES1 Trance-Formation Of America, p 1742 Recorded conversations with the author3 See http://www.suite101.com/artlcle.cfm/ritual_abuse/439224 Correspondence with the author5 http://www.rense.com/general6/ciajew.htm6 Recorded conversations with the author and on the video, Revelations Of AMother Goddess250Children of the Matrix7 Recorded conversations with the author8 Correspondence with the author and posted at davidicke.com9 Ibid10 http://www.utlm.org/ and see also http://www.exmormon.org/stories.htm11 http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles/femaicke.html12 http://www.reptilianagenda.com/exp/e012000a.html13 http://www.ufomind.com/ufo/updates/1998/jun/m09-009.shtml and seealsohttp://www.sightings.eom/ufo/screwingaliens.hCHAPTER 13Serving the dragon:the present (2)We are here to learn to love each other. I don't know what the others are herefor.AudenDr David Jacobs, a professor of history at Temple University in theUnitedStates, made a long and detailed study of abductee reports andpublishedhis conclusions in a book called The Threat: The Secret Agenda (Simon &Schuster,New York, 1988).He says that the \"alien agenda\" includes breeding hybrids using human andaliengenetic material, and replacing human society with these hybrids undertheircontrol. This is the real reason behind all the abductions in which malesperm istaken or females are impregnated, according to Dr Jacobs. He says thefirst stage isto cross human genetics with the \"alien\". Then this geneticmaterial is fused withanother human egg and sperm, and this second-stage hybridis crossed withanother human egg and sperm. The result of this would look almosthuman andwhen this is crossed with yet another human egg and sperm, the resultcould walkdown the street without being noticed.1 He could be describing herethe way thefirst creation of the Anunnaki, what some people call \"the Adam\", wasevolvedinto the human mammal we see today. Dr Jacobs believes that theselater-stagehybrids are what abductees call the \"Nordics\", although not all ofthem areblond-haired and blue-eyed. 1 think we need to note the differencebetween theextraterrestrial \"Nordics\" that came to the Earth and seeded theirown bloodlinesand the Nordic-type hybrid crossbreeds and others that 1 call theAryans. Dr Jacobssays that these \"super-hybrids” retain many of their \"alien\"abilities. These includescanning the minds of humans and controlling abductees.He suggests that whilethe hybrids may have some human characteristics, theythink like the \"aliens\" andanswer to them. \"The hybrid agenda is the alienagenda,\" he says. Dr Jacobsbelieves that in the final stages of the agenda,humans will be slowly \"phased out\"while the hybrids are \"phased in\". Memories ofloving mothers, fathers, freedomof choice and religion will be replaced bymemories of selective breeding, single-minded functions geared to serving thealiens. These hybrids would have a hivementality with no memories of individualchoice, family bonding, or freedom. Itwould, he says, be a hierarchical, fascistorder in which a ruling caste dominateslesser castes. 1 could not put it better.We are almost there, but there is still time to252Children of the Matrixwake up...just. Dr Jacobs says that, from interviews with abductees, thehybridsseem unhappy with their situation and long for the freedom of humans.Reptilian abductionsJames L. Walden, an American with a doctorate in business education, had somanyreptilian experiences that he described them in a book, The Ultimate AlienAgenda(Llewellyn Publications, St Paul, Minnesota, 1998). Before his firstexperience, hehad no interest in extraterrestrials or UFOs or \"science fiction\"of any kind. Hisstory began in March 1992 when a grey entity some four feet tallwith large darkeyes and a large, bulbous head, appeared in the room as he wasswitching off thelight to go to bed. The air became extremely cold and a\"petrified\" Walden began tocry. He said the right eye of the grey enlarged andturned bright red. It projected abeam of red light, which struck him painfullyon the leg. A beam of white light latercame down towards him, he said, and itentered his body just below the navel. Helost consciousness and when he woke hewas lying on a cold table of polishedmetal. He was immobilised and a brightoverhead light was shining in his eyes.Around him were people in \"stiff whitesmocks\". Some appeared human, but mostlooked like the being that came to hisbedroom. They examined every part of hisbody and a sperm sample was taken. TheZulu shaman Credo Mutwa describes asimilar scene and events during his abductionin what is now Zimbabwe in theearly 1960s (see The Reptilian Agenda, part one).Walden said he was told that he wasin an underground facility in south-eastKansas and would not be harmed. Heheard a \"telepathic voice” say: \"You are notwho you think you are, and you mustaccept this.\" In later experiences, he wastold that he was a reptilian-human hybrid.Many strange things began to happen tohim after the first abduction:\"One night...I was lying on my back and searching the ceiling for sleep, when Ihearda loud 'whishing' sound. Something moved toward me at lightning-speed - andalarge, life-like image of George Washington stopped right in front of my face,touchingmy nose. I heard a loud, forceful voice, say: 'George Washington was oneof us. Soare you. You must accept.'\"2George Washington was an Illuminati bloodline, a Grand Master Freemason,andfirst President of the United States. In the years that followed, JamesWaldenhad many other experiences with greys and other more obvious reptiliansandworked with the abduction researcher Barbara Bartholic to uncover what wasgoingon. She had heard the same story many times from other people claiming tobeabductees. One entity that Walden experienced was an \"interdimensionalreptile\". Itwas between eight and twelve feet tall and had elongated feet. Therewas a \"web\"between his torso and arms, \"like a bat\", which could sometimes looklike wings,and a \"fin-like appendage\" on his back. His head was large andelongated like awatermelon. The being had rough, greenish patterned skin, andWalden believedthere was a tail also. This entity claimed to have inhabited many\"human\" bodiesand he said: \"My eyes have witnessed the evolution of humankind.\"3Under253hypnosis, Walden recalled that he was part of an experimental group ofhumanembryos, which were grown in a test tube. The embryo, he recalled, wasimplantedinto his mother's womb and she had no idea this had been done. Couldthis be anexplanation of the legends of Merovee, Alexander the Great, andothers, who weresaid to have been fathered by serpent-like beings? And couldthis be at least oneorigin of the \"Virgin Birth\"? Walden said it certainlyoffered an explanation for whyhe had always felt different to all the otherchildren. He believed that millions ofpeople in the world had been created inthis way as part of an \"alien\" geneticprogramme. He said that the semen, takenduring his abduction, was used toimpregnate a woman of the \"same stock\". She waslike a \"human incubator\" and hethinks the embryo was removed from her womblater.Another interesting memory he had was that when he was on the table in thatfirstabduction, his body had looked the same as the \"aliens\".4 Walden felt thatthiswas another-dimension of him, which inhabited his human form. He believedfromhis experiences that the \"aliens\" could transcend time, transformmatter,manipulate human thought and behaviour, and create \"distracting illusionstosatisfy the needs of our simple human minds.\" He concluded that they couldmovebetween dimensions and that they were less \"extraterrestrial\" andmore\"interdimensional\". 1 thoroughly agree. Their ability to change theirvibrationalstate would explain how they can appear and disappear (leave ourfrequencyrange), and how they can walk through walls. They can move throughdense matterin the same way a radio frequency can. And if it is the fourth-dimensional level of aperson that is abducted, and not, or not always, thephysical body, it would furtherexplain why abductees have described being takenthrough walls and buildings.Walden speculated that these fourth-dimensional\"aliens\" are actually the fourth-dimensional level of ourselves.The abductors told Jim Walden that an interdimensional race had colonisedtheEarth and they came to harvest the planet's resources, harness its energies,and useprimitive humans as its workforce. \"Just as human scientists havedevelopedanimals for nourishment, labour, and entertainment purposes,” he said,\"alienscientists have improved humans for the same reason - and possiblyothers.\"5Walden said the \"aliens\" could program the emotional responses of theirhybrids, toproduce \"misery, jealousy, passion, or love.”\" Walden said that whentheinterdimensional reptilians first colonised the Earth they found it difficulttoreproduce here. He said that during abductions, the \"aliens\" made it possibleforthem to inhabit the abductee's body.7 This would explain why Miguel de laMadridsaid they needed to create \"bodies\" through which they could operate onthisplanet. Walden said the aliens lived in \"subterranean shelters\" from thetime theyarrived, and conditions in the Earth's atmosphere threatened theirsurvival becausethey could not maintain a constant body temperature. He saidtheir eyes areextremely sensitive to light and this fits with Credo Mutwa'sclaims about the light-sensitive eyes of the greys and other reptilians, andwith the symbolic story of theblood-drinking Dracula who could not go out duringthe day. Walden was,surprisingly, very positive about the reptilians by the timehis book was finished,254Children of the Matrixbut I think he was taking their word for their true intentions for humanity alittletoo easily. The evidence is overwhelming that some of them have a verymalevolentagenda, but that is only one large faction, not all of them. Someother abductees alsosee the reptilians in a positive light, despite havinghorrendous experiences withthem, and some researchers get incredibly angry withanyone who paints thereptilians in a negative light. Mark Amaru Pinkham, authorof The Return Of TheSerpents Of Wisdom, superbly details the serpent symbolismand bloodlines of theancient world, but sees them in a virtually 100% positivelight. He even praisespeople like Benjamin Franklin as a force forenlightenment. Franklin sacrificedchildren! Depicting all reptilians asexpressions of \"wisdom\" is just as ludicrous asdepicting them all as \"evil\". Andthose who have a horrific agenda for humanity, ofcourse, want us to believe theyare here to \"save\" us.Stories about people waking up to find reptilian figures in the room areregularlyreported. Pamela Hamilton, an American woman who has lived inCalifornia andArizona, claims to have been visited at home, often in thebedroom, by countless\"Nordic\" blond-haired, blue-eyed beings, along with greysand reptilians, since shewas young.8 Witnesses have seen the marks on her bodythat have followed manyof these visits. She has also suffered a raid by militarypersonnel who walked in andstole material relating to extraterrestrials and UFO activity. Pamela describedareptilian \"visitor\" who appeared a number of times. She said he had luminousamber-coloured eyes like a cat and had grey-green skin and sharp claws onhisfingers. He wore a sort of \"breast-plate\" like the ones used by Romansoldiers, shesaid. When he appeared she would first hear a high-pitched soundand a buzzingand clicking noise and soon found it hard to breath. She felt thather chest wasbeing crushed. When she became paralysed and immobilised, the reptilianwould\"flip\" her on to her chest and begin to have \"a type of tantric sexualintercourse\"that would leave her exhausted. Feeding on her life force, probably.She said he wasextremely powerful and very aggressive and a likely member of awarrior caste. Butshe didn't fear him and almost felt protected by him.California and Arizona appear to be extremely important areas for reptilianactivity, especially locations such as: Mount Lassen, a dormant volcano that ispartof the Cascade range of California, Oregon, Washington State, andsouth-westernCanada; Sedona, the \"New Age\" centre in Arizona; and Phoenix, two hours southofSedona in the Valley of the Sun. The Superstition Mountains outside Phoenixhavebeen the subject of a number of stories in which people claim to haveseenphysical reptilian beings. You can read some of these on mywebsite,www.davidicke.com. One involves a woman known as \"Angie\" who lovedclimbing the mountains around Phoenix, including the Superstitions.9 Onthisoccasion she found a cave and went inside. She sat down and began to drinkwaterfrom her flask. After a while she got up to leave when suddenly she felt ahand grabhers from behind. She gasped in surprise when she looked up at areptilian face.She tried to laugh, thinking it was someone wearing a mask. Whenshe realised itwas for real she tried to scream, but nothing would come. Shelost consciousnessand when she awoke she heard strange barking and chirping sounds that she later255realised were a sort of \"language\" the reptilians used. When she tried to getup.she found she couldn't move her arms or legs. She felt a hand on the insideof herthighs and she struggled to open her eyes. She opened one a little and sawmenwith lizard-like faces. Her heart sank and she felt absolute horror burstthrough her.Again when she tried to scream, she couldn't. She watched as severalgreenishreptilians removed her clothes. They seemed to be a strange combinationof humanand serpent, she said. The wide slit eyes almost glowed with a yellowishbrightness(exactly what Credo Mutwa says), and they had glistening, verticalpupils. Theyhad broad flat noses and their flat nostrils flared slightly as theysnorted whileexamining her. She said that some had a very wide mouth with manyfolds of skin,while some had small mouths with no folds. They had small, roundedears, whichwere set high on the head, and had no lobes. She noticed that theirscales were adifferent colour than the skin on the head. They were a khaki greenthat becamegrey-green on the back of the head. Their faces were smooth withnarrow, pointedchins. Two of them wore a white jumpsuit with an insignia thatincluded a curveddragon with a seven-pointed star in the middle. The other'reptile-men' wore blackuniforms with the same insignia. She also talked of atall, white-skinned lizardbeing with blue eyes - the ones identified many timesas the \"royal Draco\", thehighest of the reptilian hierarchy. He wore a \"burntorange jumpsuit\" with threeinsignia on the left side. There was a black invertedtriangle, the round dragon witha star, and an oval with moving stars on it. Onthe right side of his uniform werethree black bars on a silver disk; and theleft cuff had a row of inverted triangleswith three lines cutting through it. Hewas taller than the others, nearly seven feet.Angie was by now naked on the floor and she asked the \"white Draco\" to helpher.She felt something cold touch her forehead, and a strange calm andpeaceenveloped her. She then realised she was in an oval room about 15 feetwide. Shetried to turn her head, but she couldn't. She noticed pipes withstrange \"sacs\", likemis-shaped balloons hanging from them. Then she realisedsome were moving. Sheremembered how her dog's belly moved that way when she wasnear full term withher puppies. A wave of horror hit her. It was as if therewere two minds inside her.One was calm, the other horror-stricken. The calm sidewas in charge of her body.She wondered how her body could be so calm whenanything could be about tohappen to her. One of the lizard men undressed andapproached the end of the table.He was muscular and had scales on his chest andlower stomach. Fear nowoverwhelmed the artificial calm and she began to screamand find superhumanstrength to fight him off. The lizard men turned a blue lighton her and she lostconsciousness. The last thing she remembered was feeling theweight of his body.When Angie came to, she was in her car. She looked aroundher, feeling confusedand wondering why she was driving her car. She felt thatshe had been about to dosomething, but couldn't remember what. She drove homedazed and disorientated.There she suddenly had an urge to shower, and scrubbedher body for over twohours. She felt shaky and angry for something she couldn'trecall. She spent the nextfew days in bed refusing to answer the door. Hersister Susan noticed that Angie hadseveral nightmares every night and woke upscreaming. Angie also refused to go256Children of the Matrixnear the mountains she loved so much. When she later went back to work, sheleftafter three days when a customer brought a lizard into the store. She had noideawhy that had frightened her so much when reptiles had always been a part ofherlife there in the desert. Eventually she went to a hypnotist for help, andher vivid anddetailed memories of what happened in the Superstition Mountainsflooded back.Eva Trent, another American, also claims to have had many contacts withnon-human entities.'\" One night in January 1999, she went to bed in her smallapartment.Later, she said, she woke to a \"buzzing sound\" and when she opened hereyes shewas horrified to see two strange creatures standing on either side ofher bed. Onewas around seven to eight feet tall, weighed around 19 stone(getting on for 300pounds) with the skin of a crocodile or snake. The other was the same, butsmaller.They seemed to be communicating in a \"chirping\" manner and their eyesglowed.Chirping sounds are pretty common in such reports and the glowing eyesareuniversal. The Sumerians knew Enlil, the chief Anunnaki on the Earth, as\"theSerpent with the shining eyes\". Eva found she was unable to move,anotherconfirmation of the ancient and modern accounts of how the serpent \"gods\"couldparalyse people. They communicated with her through telepathy. She feltthey wereobserving her emotional state and probably feeding off the energy offear theirpresence had generated. Similar points were made by Pamela Stonebrookeaboutthe way her reptilian seemed to get high on fear. The experience ended forEvawhen she began to mentally resist and visualised herself cocooned in whitelight.This seemed to confuse the reptilians and the next thing she remembers waswakingup the next morning physically exhausted. When she checked around the roomshefound five of her favourite cassettes tapes in a rack six feet from her bedhad beendestroyed. They were distorted and three were badly buckled, as if bysomeextreme heat. Yet there was no smell of plastic burns and the soundfilaments hadnot been melted. There was no sign of any heat being appliedanywhere on or nearthe rack. The only explanation was that they had beensubjected to some kind ofmicrowave heat.The American writer Alex Christopher has been exposing the reptilian presenceformany years and I first saw her speak in Denver in 1996. She is the author ofthebooks. Pandora's Box, volumes I and II, and she has had her own directexperiences ofreptilians and the \"big-eyed greys\". In Panama City, Florida, shewas woken at 2.30in the morning by her terrified neighbour, a commercial airlinepilot. When she ranover to his house, she found his partner sliding down thewall with her eyes rollingand she kept passing out. Alex said she could feelextremely powerful energy in theroom, which appeared to be trying to penetrateher head. It was radiation of somekind and the next day all the plants in theroom were dead. The couple told her thatthey were making love when the incidentstarted. They saw a flash of light and theywere pulled from the bed. The manstill had a palm print on his side made by fingersthat must have been ten incheslong with claws that burned into his skin. The nextday the spot was so painfulhe couldn't touch it and Alex says she has video footageof this. For her,however, the story was just the beginning because when she was inbed in her ownhouse, a reptilian appeared to her:257\"I woke up and there is this 'thing' standing over my bed. He hadwrap-around-yelloweyes with snake pupils and pointed ears and a grin thatwrapped around his head. Hehad a silvery suit on and this scared the livingdaylights out of me. I threw the coversover my head and started screaming...1mean, here is this thing with a Cheshire-catgrin and these funky glowingeyes...this is too much. I have seen this kind of beingon more than oneoccasion...He had a hooked nose and was very human lookingother than his eyes,and had kind of greying skin...\"...Later on in 1991, I was working in a building in a large city, and I hadtaken abreak about 6pm and the next thing I knew it was 10.30pm and I thought Ihad takena short break. I started remembering that I was taken aboard a[spaceship], throughfour floors of the office building and through a roof. Thereon the ship is where Iencountered Germans and Americans working together, andalso grey aliens, andthen we were taken to some other kind of facility and thereI saw reptiliansagain...the ones I call the 'Baby Godzilla’s’ that have shortteeth and yellow slanted-eyes...The things that stick in my minds are the beingsthat look like reptiles, or the’velcoci-rapters'. They are the cruellest beingsyou could ever imagine and they evensmell hideous.\"11The putrid smell is another theme of contact with reptilians and greys. Itwasduring this abduction that Alex Christopher saw a dragon badge on the uniformofa reptilian. A contact said she saw the same symbol at Fort Walden in theUnitedStates and a winged-serpent symbol could be seen on the sleeve of anIsraeli soldieras he comforted the daughter of the assassinated Prime Minister,Yitzchak Rabin,during his funeral in 1995 (see Newsweek, November 20th 1995).Many badgeswithin the US armed forces feature the dragon and reptile, asrevealed in theSymbolism Archive on my website. There are many reports ofshape-shiftingreptilians at military bases and medical facilities. The authorand researcher JohnKeel has gathered together reports of flying reptiles seen bymany people. These areknown as \"pterodactyloid-hominoid mothmen\", flyingserpents, or winged Draco.These align with ancient and modern descriptionsacross the world of the \"royal\"reptilians from the Draco constellation withtheir wings, tails, and horns. Keelcompiled his findings in a book. The MothmenProphecies (Signet Books, New York,1976). Here is a sample:\"...According to her story, Connie [Carpenter], a shy, sensitiveeighteen-year-old, wasdriving home from church at 10:30am on Sunday, November27, 1966, when, as shepassed the deserted greens of Mason County Golf Courseoutside New Haven, WestVirginia, she suddenly saw a huge grey figure. It wasshaped like a man, she said,but much larger. It was at least seven feet tall andvery broad. The thing thatattracted her attention was not its size, but itseyes. It had, she said, large, round,fiercely glowing red eyes that focussed onher with hypnotic effect. 'It's a wonderI didn't run off the road and have awreck,' she commented later.258Children of the Matrix\"As she slowed, her eyes fixed on the apparition, a pair of wings unfolded fromitsback. They seemed to have a span of about ten feet. It was definitely not anordinarybird, but a man-shaped thing, which rose slowly off the ground, straightup like ahelicopter, silently. Its wings did not flap in flight. It headedstraight toward Connie'scar, its horrible eyes fixed to her face, and then itswooped low over her head as sheshoved the accelerator to the floorboards inutter hysteria. Over one hundred peoplewould see this bizarre creature thatwinter.\"12Significantly, many of the sightings of these flying reptile-men happened closetothe apparently sealed entrances to underground tunnels known as the TNTfacility,which were used to store explosives during the Second World War. Ayoung shoesalesman called Thomas Ury was driving along Route 62 just north ofthe TNT areawhen he noticed a tall, grey, man-like figure standing in a fieldnear the road.'Suddenly it spread a pair of wings', he said, 'and took offstraight up, like ahelicopter.\" Native Americans have the legend of theThunderbird, which, the storiessay, abducts children and old people. The tribesof the Dakotas know this as Piasaand it is described as a demon monster with batwings, a humanoid body, a long tail,and terrifying red eyes. Similar reportshave come from many parts of the world.Another witness called Odette told of an experience at a house in Quebec,Canada.She was with a friend when another woman came over and began to talkabout UFOsand contactees. The woman said she was a contactee and she had ameeting with aspaceship on a certain date. She also said that they were takingher and she wouldnever be back on Earth. Odette said she was not convinced atall and especially whenthe woman had said that if they could only see her realself, they would see howbeautiful she is, like a princess inside. \"1 wasthinking, yeah right! Whatever!!!\",Odette recalled. The woman looked around 30years old, tall and strong, light hair,cut to her shoulder, and was \"ordinarylooking\". Then she asked Odette if she wouldlet her reveal her real self becauseshe would never have seen anyone like her. But shesaid she needed Odette'spermission for this. Odette said yes because she thought,\"Poor thing, she'sreally miserable...” The account continues:\"We went to a quiet room. We sat facing each other, and she grabbed my hands,toldme to relax and just look at her. What I saw was a reptile, taller than shewas, at least6 feet, green/brown colour, staring at me with its head turned sideways, and I swearwith something that seemed like a grin on its face. Then she/itasked me \"Didn't I tellyou I was beautiful?' I said yes, and headed for thedoor...If anybody has had a similarexperience or knows of a book that talksabout reptilians please let me know.\"13Men in BlackReports of reptilian shape-shifters come in from all over the world and the \"MeninBlack\" phenomenon has also been connected to them. These are the guys dressedinblack suits, who intimidate many UFO researchers and abductees. Most appeartobe government agents, but there are other expressions of them who do not look259\"human\" in the usual sense. They have a strange aura around them and, manypeoplehave reported, they can suddenly \"disappear\". 1 remember seeing a garageownerand UFO investigator telling his story on a TV programme about Men inBlack or\"MIBs”. They turned up out of nowhere without a vehicle and yet hisgarage was inthe middle of the countryside, all by itself. After their conversation,they justas quickly vanished and it was impossible for them to do so undernormalcircumstances because you could see for miles in all directions. The Menin Blackare named after their dark clothing, mostly business or \"agent\" suits,and their darkglasses. This attire has all the signs of these beings needingprotection from the Sun- a classic trait of the reptilians and greys. They aremostly described as having verywhite skin and, sometimes, olive skin. Thetexture is often said to be reptilian. Otherstrange traits in witness accountsare the trouble the MIBs appear to have breathingand the horrible smell, likesulphur, which abductees are constantly describing.They also often arrive in\"new\" black cars that have not been manufactured fordecades. Despite theirapparent age, these vehicles show no signs of any wear ortear. It is as if theyhave just been driven from the factory. Similar beings, dressed inthe context ofthe period, have been reported over the centuries in many parts of theworld. Theso-called Grim Reaper, who appeared in communities just before alethal diseasebroke out, were described in terms that are remarkably close totoday's Men inBlack.The Association of Extraterrestrial Investigations (APEX), founded by DrMaxBerezowsky in Sao Paulo, Brazil, documented a Men in Black story involvingayoung guy called Aeromar.14 He said he was harassed by three men dressed inblacksuits and ties and he thought they were the police. He moved cities twiceto getaway from them and on one occasion complained to the police in Rio deJaneiroabout their harassment. They didn't believe him and he moved to SaoPaulo. It wasthere that a car stopped beside him in the street. He said he \"losthis will to resist\"and climbed inside to find the three guys who had beenfollowing him for months.He was driven to a wooden area, he said, where he saw alarge \"UFO\". The carstopped and they all walked up to the craft, which washovering above the groundand surrounded by a \"luminous ring\". The next thing heknew, they were insideand he was sat in a chair with handles that secured hiswrists. An iron bar pressedhis head backwards against the chair and his neck wasalso fastened. Now, he said,the \"Men in Black\" transformed. Their \"heads rippedopen into a heart shape\" andtheir skin became scaled and green like a reptilian.This happened in 1979-80 longbefore MIBs became associated with reptilians. Hesaid he also saw human corpseshanging from hooks. Everything went blank afterthat and he found himself back inthe street where he was picked up. Now,however, it was hours later and therewas no traffic. He ran home in a panic, hesaid, and told a room mate what hadhappened, but as he did so, a force threw himagainst a wall. The reptilians had toldhim never to talk about his experience.He was later introduced to Dr MaxBerezowsky and he told his story to APEXmembers.On the superb US radio show, Sightings, a woman called Joyce Murphy talkedaboutthe reptilian shape-shifters of Brazil. She is the president and founder of260Children of the MatrixBeyond Boundaries, an organisation that takes people on expeditions to manypartsof the world. She was telling presenter Jeff Rense about some of thestrangeexperiences on her travels when she talked about a policewoman she knewin Brazilwho had described shape-shifting reptilian beings. Joyce said:\"...she works in a very high position in the Sheriff's Office. There seem to beshape-shifters, here in Brazil at least, that try and get women to act asbreeders for them.They actually shape-shifted to show them their actual form, asort of reptilian type.This with her sister as a witness. And I know of anothershape-shifter story. Thedaughter of an aviation engineer in Sao Paulo tells of afellow student who revealedher true form changing...into a sort of reptilianbeing. These people do not knoweach other and they clam up if one goes aftermore information or wants to reveal thewhole situation. Oh my gosh, what am Igetting into here?\"15The reptilian underground basesThere are so many reports of seeing reptilians and shape-shifting, but mostpeoplehave no knowledge of this because 99% of the population get their \"news\"and\"information\" from the mainstream media. The media, in turn, get their\"news\"and \"information\" overwhelmingly from official sources, which, like themediaitself, are owned by the reptilian bloodlines. After speaking about thereptilians onthe Sightings programme, 1 was sent this account of an experienceat the infamousDulce underground facility in New Mexico. These are the words ofan army privateemployed on the surface:\"...I was working on a routine job when another of the young enlistees, amechanic,came in with a small rush job he wanted at once. He had the print andproceeded toshow me exactly what he wanted. We are both bending over the benchin front of thewelder when I happened to look directly into his face. It seemedto suddenly becomecovered in a semi-transparent film or cloud. His featuresfaded and in their placeappeared a 'thing' with bulging eyes, no hair, andscales for skin.\"He later saw the same thing happen to a guard at the Dulce front gate,andwitnesses have spoken of seeing reptilian shape-shifters at the MadiganMilitaryHospital near Fort Lewis in Washington State. There are secretundergroundfacilities throughout the world and at the deepest levels they openout into theinner-earth centres of the reptilians and greys. Area 51 in Nevadais the best-knownunderground facility in UFO research circles, but the very factthat it is so famousand featured in Hollywood movies, shows that it is far fromthe most important ofthem. These facilities are themselves connected by a vasttunnel network that hasbeen built with nuclear boring technology that the publicnever sees. It can cuttunnels at the rate of seven miles a day and these are anexpansion of the globaltunnel network created by the Atlanteans and Lemurians,and claimed by legendsand accounts to exist under the United States, Central andSouth America, Britain,Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turkey, Asia, China, Malta, everywhere. The tunnelshavestate-of-the-art transport systems that move at astonishing speeds. Insidersdescribethem as \"magneto-leviton or mag-lev monorail trains capable of mach-2\".LeadingIlluminati companies and operations are involved in the construction.Companieslike the Rand Corporation, General Electric, AT & T, Hughes Aircraft,NorthropCorporation, Sandia Corporation, Stanford Research Institute, WalshConstruction,the Colorado School of Mines, and the most significant one of all,Bechtel (Beck-tul),a major reptilian corporation.These underground bases, tunnel systems, and their technology, have beendetailedby former military personnel, mind-controlled slaves, and people likePhilSchneider, who helped to build some of them. Schneider was the son of aGermanU-boat commander in the Second World War, Otto Oscar Schneider. His fatherwascaptured and taken to the United States to work for the Illuminati. As sooftenhappens, the children of Illuminati operatives are brought up to work forthe samemasters and Phil Schneider says he was commissioned to build sections ofanumber of underground facilities in the United States. He said he knew of131underground military bases, an average of one mile deep, constructed for theNewWorld Order agenda. Two of the bases he was involved with were Area 51inNevada and Dulce, New Mexico. Dulce is a small town of around 1,000 peopleandlocated on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation at a height of some 7,000 feet.From inand around Dulce have come a stream of reports of UFO sightings andlandings,\"alien\" abductions, human and animal mutilations, and sightings ofreptilians.The base was also the alleged scene, in 1979, of the \"Dulce Wars\"when reptiliansand greys are said to have battled with human military andcivilian personnel.Many people on both sides were killed and Phil Schneiderclaims to have takenpart in this shoot-out. He said he was hit by a laser weaponand he had a fantasticscar down his chest, as he publicly revealed. Schneidertalked of his part inthe battle in a lecture in 1995, although there appear tobe many other elementsto it, also:\"My job was to go down the holes and check the rock samples, and recommendtheexplosive to deal with the particular rock. As I was headed down there, wefoundourselves amidst a large cavern that was full of outer-space aliens,otherwise knownas large Greys. I shot two of them. At that time, there were 30people down there.About 40 more came down after this started, and all of themgot killed. We hadsurprised a whole underground base of existing aliens. Later,we found out that theyhad been living on our planet for a long time. ...Thiscould explain a lot of what isbehind the theory of ancient astronauts.\"Schneider began to speak out and alert the world to what was going on,althoughas usual most people didn't listen. Schneider, who worked closely withresearcherAlex Christopher, died in January 1996 in highly suspiciouscircumstances thatwere crudely made to look like suicide. Schneider, speaking ata public lecture ayear earlier, said:262Children of the Matrix\"...for every calendar year that transpires, military technology increases about44.5years [compared with the increase rate of 'conventional' technology]. Thisis why it iseasy to understand that back in 1943 they were able to create,through the use ofvacuum tube technology, a ship that could literally disappearfrom one place andappear in another place.\"This was a reference to the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" in which a US naval shipisalleged to have been made invisible and taken into another dimension. Anotherofthe underground bases Schneider helped to build is under the newDenverInternational Airport, east of Denver. The construction was verycontroversialbecause of the massive cost overrun - the same as the gigantic holebeing dug byBechtel as part of \"transport improvements\" in Boston,Massachusetts. DenverAirport is the place with the gargoyles, Freemasonicsymbols, and murals full ofIlluminati symbolism. 1 have been through theremyself a number of times.According to Schneider, there are several main levelsunderneath, at least ten sub-levels, a 4.5-square-mile underground city, and an88.5-square-mile undergroundbase. The Denver base is said to include massive\"containment camps\" and fencedin areas deep underground for holding\"dissidents\". Workers who experienced thedeeper levels of the base saw scenes soterrifying they have refused to talk aboutthem. From other sources, however, wecan imagine some of what they saw. Thesebases are where many of the millions,yes millions, of children who go missingevery year worldwide are taken. 1 knowit is hard to stomach, but they are used forslave labour and eaten by thereptilians, just like humans eat chicken or cows.Workers at the Dulce base inNew Mexico have reported seeing the most grotesquesights in the lower levels.Researchers Bill Hamilton and TAF Fevesque (also knownas Jason Bishop III)gathered the following information about Dulce, which theypublished in UFOmagazine:\"Level number six is privately called 'Nightmare Hall'. It holds the GeneticLabs.Reports from workers who have seen bizarre experimentation are as follows:'I haveseen multi-legged \"humans\" that look like half-human/half octopus. Alsoreptilian-humans and furry creatures that have hands like humans and cry like ababy. Itmimics human words...also a huge mixture of lizard-humans in cages.There are fish,seals, birds and mice that can hardly be considered thosespecies. There are severalcages (and vats) of winged humanoids, grotesquebat-like creatures...but three and ahalf to seven feet tall. Gargoyle-likebeings and Draco reptoids.\"Level number seven is worse, row after row of thousands of humans andhumanmixtures in cold storage. Here, too, are embryo storage vats of humanoidsin variousstages of development. [One worker said] '...I frequently encounteredhumans in cages,usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and beggedfor help. We were toldthey were hopelessly insane, and involved in high-riskdrug tests to cure insanity. Wewere told never to try to speak to them at all.At the beginning we believed that story.Finally, in 1978, a small group ofworkers discovered the truth'...\"16This discovery led to the \"Dulce Wars\", the battle between humans andthereptilians and reptilian greys in 1979 when many scientists and militarypersonnelwere killed, and Phil Schneider says he was critically wounded. Asecurity officer atDulce called Thomas Castello has described to researcherswhat happens at the Dulcebase and his words were reported in the UFO magazinearticle. His information hasalso been circulated as the \"Dulce Papers\". Castelloworked for seven years with theRand Corporation, an Illuminati operation inSanta Monica, California, andtransferred to Duke in 1977. He estimated therewere more than 18,000 of the \"shortgreys\" at Dulce, and he had also seen tallreptilian humanoids. He knew of sevenlevels, but there could have been more, andhe said the \"aliens\" were on levels five,six, and seven. The lower you go, thehigher the security clearance you need. The onlysign in English was above thetube shuttle station which said \"to Los Alamos\",another major undergroundreptilian base in New Mexico. Most signs at Dulce are inthe \"alien symbollanguage\" and a universal symbol system understood by humansand aliens, he said.The Illuminati communicate above ground in the language ofsymbolism, as revealedin The Biggest Secret and the Symbolism Archive on mywebsite. The hieroglyphicsof Sumer, Egypt, and China, would have been a reptilianor \"alien\" languageoriginally. Other tunnel connections from Dulce went tounderground facilities atPage, Arizona, Area 51 in Nevada, Taos, Carlsbad, and Datil,New Mexico, ColoradoSprings and Creede, Colorado. Castello said there was a vastnetwork of tubeshuttle connections under the United States, which extends into aglobal systemof tunnels and sub-cities.He described the immense security at Dulce. Below the second level, everyoneisweighed naked and given a uniform. Any change in weight is noted and peopleareexamined and X-rayed if there is a change of three pounds. At the entrance toall\"sensitive\" areas there are scales and a person's weight must match withtheir cardand code to gain entry. Castello also revealed some of the geneticwork carried outat Dulce. He said that their scientists can separate the\"bioplasmic body\" from thephysical body and place an \"alien entity\"(consciousness) within a human bodyafter removing the \"soul\" of the human. Ihave thought for years that some famouspeople, including prime ministers andpresidents, were taken into such facilitiesand possessed by a reptilian entity.To the public the famous person looks the samephysically afterwards, but now avery different force is deciding the behaviour.Ancient legends also tell ofpeople being replaced in the night by \"changelings\" orshape-shifters. It islikely that certain bloodlines with a threshold ratio of reptilianDNA makes thispossession easier and this is one reason why the Illuminati keepsuch detailedgenetic records of family bloodlines. The joint global pressannouncement by theIlluminati's Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in 2000 about themapping of the humangenome takes on even greater significance when you thinkthat the US Departmentof Energy has laboratories at Dulce and is closely connectedto the genomeproject, along with the National Institute of Health, the NationalScienceFoundation, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. All are Illuminatifronts.Researcher Alan Walton, who writes extensively on the Internet aboutthereptilian connection, says:264Children of the Matrix\"Underneath most major cities, especially in the USA in fact, there existsubterraneancounterpart 'cities' controlled by the Masonic/hybrid/alien 'elite'.Often surface/subsurface terminals exist beneath Masonic Lodges, policestations, airports, andfederal buildings of major cities ... and even not so'major' cities. The populationratio is probably close to 10% of the population(the hybrid military-industrial fraternity’elite' living below ground as opposedto the 90% living above). This does not includethe full-blood reptilian specieswho live in even deeper recesses of the Earth.\"Some of the major population centers were deliberately established bytheMasonic/hybrid elite of the Old and New 'worlds' to afford easy access toalreadyexisting underground levels, some of which are thousands of years old.Consideringthat the Los Alamos Labs [in New Mexico] had a working prototypenuclear poweredthermol-bore drill that could literally melt tunnels through theEarth at a rate of 8 mph40 years ago, you can imagine how extensive theseunderground systems havebecome. These sub-cities also offer close access toorganised criminal syndicates,which operate on the surface. They have developeda whole science of 'borg-onomics' through which they literally nickle-and-dimeus into slavery via multi-leveledtaxation, inflation, sublimation, manipulation,regulation, fines, fees, licenses... andthe entire debt-credit scam which is runby the Federal Reserve and Wall Street.\"New York City, I can confirm, is one of the largest draconian nests in theworld. Orrather the ancient underground 'Atlantean' systems that network beneaththat area.They literally control the entire Wall Street pyramid from below...with more than alittle help from reptilian bloodlines like the Rockefellers,etc. In fact these reptiliangenetic lines operate in a parasitic manner, theunderground society acting as the'parasite' society and the surface societyoperating as the 'host' society. ...As for theNew York City / Wall Street'nest', during the bombing of the World Trade Center (akaWorld Slave Center)wherein terrorists attempted to topple one of the towers into theother, a littleknown fact was briefly revealed. A six-levelled sub-basement controlledby the USSecret Service suffered heavy damage. These six sub-basements, onebeneath theother, may not have ended there, based on other information that I'veuncoveredof massive alien infestation beneath the New York City area. These sub-basementsmay actually serve as a major terminal between the underground societyof Masonicelite, and the surface society which it controls.\"\"I am sure that the locations of these major cities were selected because theywereabove underground reptilian-Nefilim tunnel and cavern systems and/or theywereon significant vortex points. Phoenix, Arizona, is built on one of theseancientnetworks, as is Los Angeles - the city of the \"angels\". Lauren Savage,theWebmaster of davidicke.com in Texas, says that every county in that state hasabuilding with gothic European architecture (i.e. reptilian), which couldnotnormally have been afforded by Texas when these settlements were built inthe1870’s. Many have gargoyles. These buildings, he says, are the countycourthousessitting above underground tunnels and basement systems. Dallas is anexamplewith its underground tunnels beneath Dealey Plaza where President Kennedywasshot in 1963. What a great way for the true assassins to escape. Thesetunnelswould have been under the original Masonic lodge in Dallas, which waslocated inDealey Plaza. Close by is the 1870's old red courthouse complete withgargoyles.Underground tunnels were discovered in Dallas in the late 50's orearly 60's andLauren talked to a man who was working on a state road crew whenhe was ateenager. They were digging out what is called \"the canyon\" to buildfreewayswhen they opened up an ancient tunnel. They found rail-type tracks and asort oftrain with no known source of fuel or energy. They followed the tunnel towhere itended or collapsed, under an old livery stable. Dallas was a Frenchsettlement,earlier called Arcadia (an Illuminati code relating to Atlantis), anda suburb is stillnamed Arcadia Park. In 1999, they revealed that the Capitolbuilding in Austin hasunderground facilities, which they were going to restore.This building was theheadquarters of George W. Bush before he was manipulatedinto the presidency.Alan Walton says that Thomas Castello, the Dulce security director, describedhowthe greys, \"reptiloids\", and winged \"mothmen\" collaborate in the lower levelsofthe underground system, which includes Dulce and Los Alamos. The commandpyramid,he says, seems to be mothmen, reptiloids, and greys, with the hybrids andhumansunder them. Castello also says that one of the reptiloids told him thatthesurface of the Earth was their original home before they were removed in awar -the war of the gods - in far ancient times. They escaped underground, toother starsand planets, and even into the fourth and fifth dimensions, Castellosays he wastold. This fits with the accounts of Credo Mutwa and many abducteeswho havetold of how the reptilians evolved on this planet and were overpoweredby otherextraterrestrial groups, especially the Nordics.A woman known as \"D\" claims to have seen the underground facilities at ChinaLakeNaval Weapons Centre in the California Desert, one of the major mindcontrolcentres of North America.18 It straddles a vast area and very little canbe seen aboveground. I have driven around the outside of the base twice now. Onone side thepublic road runs alongside the perimeter fence for a while. Theentrance to ChinaLake is in the little town of Ridgecrest and this is where \"D\"once lived. Ridgecrest ishome to many mind-controlled slaves programmed at ChinaLake and it's not farfrom where the mass murderer Charles Manson and his\"Family\" used to live. \"D”, avictim of trauma-based mind control, said that themilitary chose her because of herbloodline. They had told her that before thedevelopment of language, humanscommunicated by telepathy thanks to a hormonesecreted in the brain. This hormone,she was told, was no longer operating inmost people, only in particular bloodlines,including hers, and they wanted touse these abilities. The period, thousands of yearsago, when this telepathichuman brain function was genetically suppressed wasalmost certainly symbolisedby the story common to most ancient cultures of the godsgiving people differentlanguages to divide them and stop them communicating.\"D\" said she was taken underground at China Lake and saw the geneticslaboratoryand holding centre for captured humans and genetically engineeredmutants. (Thetrue symbolism of the Mutant Ninja Turtles who lived underground266Children of the Matrixin \"sewer\" tunnels and came out to \"fight evil\"?) Reptilian symbolism, most ofitpainting reptilians in a very positive light, has been bombarding the mindsofchildren in recent years. \"D\" described seeing horrendous creatures of alltypes,shapes, and sizes at China Lake. She said she was shown these horrors tolet her seewhat would happen to her if she did not co-operate and she claimedher own sonhad been murdered. Under China Lake, she said, a reptilian sexuallyassaulted herand she saw another cut open the chest of a grey. \"D\" confirmedfrom herexperience that the greys are terrified of the reptilian leadership anddo whateverthey tell them. On another occasion, she said, she was taken to thereptilian baseunder the appropriately named Death Valley, a relatively shortdrive from ChinaLake. There she said she saw a reptilian leader, much tallerthan the others, whowas wearing an Egyptian headdress with a cobra snake motif.The respected UFO researcher, Timothy Good, quotes two \"high-placed sources\"inhis book, Unearthly Disclosure, who confirm the existence ofundergroundextraterrestrial bases. One was from the US Air Force and the otherfrom the USNavy. The reliability of these sources was supported by Admiral ofthe Fleet. LordHill-Norton, the former chief of the UK Defence Staff and formerchairman of theNATO Military Committee. Good says that the sources providedevidence that theAmerican military was working with unidentified \"aliens\" whohave establishedbases on the planet.19' Many of these bases were underwater,Good was told, a factthat would fit with the ancient legends of the \"gods\"emerging from the water. Thesources said that bases exist in Australia, thePacific Ocean, the former SovietUnion, the United States, and the Caribbean. Thelatter is believed to be in PuertoRico. The US air force contact told Good:\"They [the \"aliens\"] are here on apermanent basis. They are after this planet.”He also said they were \"messing withplate tectonics”, the movement of land thatcauses earthquakes, and that thewarming of the world's oceans was connected toextraterrestrial activity20 Well itisn't global warming, that's for sure.Interestingly, Good's sources suggested thatthe \"aliens\" were involved in\"hybridisation\" experiments to allow their race totake over the planet..This,however, began a long, long, time ago.T'was always soThe stories of reptilians and other non-human races living within the Earth inwhatwe would today call \"bases\", cities, or tunnel networks, can be foundwidelydescribed in ancient accounts also. The Nagas, or serpent people, in Indiaandthroughout Asia and the Far East, were said to live in two mainundergroundcentres called Patala and Bhogavati. From there, according to Hindulegend, theybattle for power with the Nordic underground kingdoms of Agharta andShambala.Hindus believe that Patala can be entered at the Well of Sheshna inBenares, whileBhogavati is believed to be in the Himalayas. Similar stories ofundergroundcaverns and tunnel systems can be found in Tibet and China. In theGilgameshstories of the Sumerian tablets, we are told of vast undergroundcities. Gilgameshwas a \"demi-god\" and \"semi-divine\" (reptilian hybrid) whosought the immortalityof the \"gods\". The stories speak of KI-GAL or \"the GreatBelow\", which was ruledby the goddess Ereshkigal and the god Mergal. In the KI-GAL wereviolentguardians called \"scorpion men\", reanimated human bodies, spirits andthe\"undead\", and robotic beings known as Galatur or Gala, which were used toabducthumans from the surface. There were \"eagle-headed\" reptilians, which wereoftensaid to have wings. The accounts describe a race called the Pazazu, a dog-faced\"human\" with reptilian scales and tail. All this sounds remarkably like thescenesdescribed at Dulce today. Chinese legend claims that an undergroundworldentered from the Eastern Mountain of Taishan was guarded by vicious demonscalled Men Shen with animal-like faces or masks. This was the Chinese \"Hell\"andit is said that the Lords of Hell interacted with the Dragon Kings on thesurface. TheJapanese \"Hell\" or underground network was similar, and among thenon-humanentities were the Kappa, semi-aquatic reptilian humanoids and othershape-shifterswho lived in mountains, under the ground, or under the sea. InViking-Norselegend they have the giant serpent, Nidhoggr or Jormungand, thatlivedunderground and this was similar to the giant serpent Apophis in Egyptianmyth.The Scandinavians and Germans had their Huldre or \"Hidden Folk\" who werealsoknown as the elves. One of the codes for the bloodline is \"elven\" and thebeings offolklore like trolls, etins, fairies, elves, troglodytes, Nefilim,Brownies or Braunies,and the \"little people\" of Ireland are all different namesfor the subterranean entitiesdescribed in the modern accounts of \"ET bases\".21All the same stories are associated with them - interbreeding with humans,unableto go out in the sunlight, and all the rest. They even mention the \"missingtime\"experience of people abducted by the \"fairies\" and include many stories oftheseunderground folk killing and mutilating cattle and taking the blood. MichaelMotthas produced an excellent collection of these stories on underground dwellersinfolklore and myth. His book is called Caverns, Cauldrons, And ConcealedCreatures,and is available through my website. He writes that England, Scotland, Wales,andIreland all have endless traditions of underground peoples with manysimilaritiesand common origins between them. It seems to me that Scotland, Ireland, andtheBritish Isles in general are such a major centre for the Illuminatibloodlines becauseof the number of entrances to the underground world there arein that region. It isthe same with other parts of the world like France,Germany, and the CaucasusMountains. What is really under the Windsors' Balmoral Castle or the QueenMother's Glamis Castle in Scotland, that key country for Illuminati bloodlines?Interestingly, there is a legendary \"secret room\" at Glamis. According to aguest, thewriter. Sir Walter Scott, and others, it is the family's law or customthat the secret isknown to only three people at one time. They take a \"terribleoath\" not to reveal thesecret. Another guest. Lord Halifax, said that in 1875 aworkman at the castle cameacross a door leading to a long passageway. The maninvestigated, but then he sawsomething that made him run back in terror. Whenthe 13th Earl of Strathmore wastold what the workman had seen he persuaded himto accept money to emigrateand give his word never to reveal what he saw. Lord Halifax said that aftertheincident the Earl was a changed man, who became silent and moody, with an\"anxious, scared face\".268Children of the MatrixThe Norse/Germanic fairies, goblins, trows, knockers, brownies,leprechauns,sidhe (shee), tylwyth teg (terlooeth teig) and so on were eithermalevolent orindifferent to humanity, Michael Mott says. They lived, virtuallywithout exception,under the ground. Mounds, hills, ruins, ancient raths orhill-forts, mountains, cliffs,and ancient cities were said to be the \"rooftops\"of their palaces. Beings that mirrormodern reports of the Sasquatch (Big Foot)and the Yeti (Abominable Snowman)can also be found in ancient stories ofunderground creatures that come to thesurface. Like the Nagas, the serpentpeople of Asia, European folklore often claimedthat these \"fairy\" people enteredtheir underground homes through lakes. MichaelMott continues:\"To remove all doubt as to their relationship with Norse hidden-folk and IndianNagasalike, they shunned the sunlight, and often seemed interested incrossbreeding theirown bloodlines with those of human beings, or even incrossbreeding their 'livestock'or fairy cattle, horses, hounds and so forth withthe surface species which were mostcompatible. The goblin-dwarf,Rumplestiltskin, in his lust to have the human baby andits genetic bounty, isjust one example of this in folklore. The elves took a regularinterest in humanaffairs-weddings, births, and deaths, (bloodlines), the success ofcrops andlivestock, and so forth - but only for their own selfish interests. Theyseemedto be overly-concerned with genetic and biological diversity, and theypilferedlivestock, crops, and human genes via theft or cross-species liaisonwheneverthey saw fit to do so. The elves are generally depicted as extremelyfair-hairedand fair-skinned.\"22What Mott is describing there from European folklore could have comestraightfrom the mouth of a modern abductee or researcher of the undergroundbases. Theso-called greys of modern UFO legend appear to be the same as thebeings knownas the Galatur and Ushabtiu who abducted humans from underground inSumerianand Egyptian myths, and the folklore of the Shetland Islands off thenorth ofScotland referred to the \"little men\" who abducted humans as \"greyneighbours\"and the greys. In the Americas you find the same legends and accountsof theunderground people. They include humans, reptilians, reptilian humanoids,andvarious \"monsters\" and \"demons\". Their descriptions match those of otherancientcultures all over the world. Many Native American tribes, like the Hopi,claim tohave lived within these underground cavern \"cities\" before coming tosettle on thesurface. In the Mayan epic, the Popol Vuh, two \"semi-divine\"(hybrid) brothers,Hunapuh and Xbalanque, enter the horrific underground worldcalled Xibalba tobattle a crocodile-headed monster and, as a result of theirvictory, the brothersbrought an end to human sacrifice - the calling card of thereptilians to this day.These underground worlds are the origin of the belief inHell being under the Earth.The poet, Dante (1265-1321), was an initiate of theKnights Templar. In his famouswork, the Inferno, he is taken on a tour of theunderworld. He says it consisted often levels where \"sinners\" are imprisoned andpunished by horned demons andreptilian, bird-like giants called the harpies. Theconditions and environment he269describes in this \"Hell\" can be found in descriptions of these undergroundworldsand cavern communities everywhere. The accounts even include the idea ofbeingimprisoned down there waiting for the day of judgement.In Ireland and the Isle of Man, two major locations for Illuminati bloodlinesandactivity, much of their culture is based on fairy legends and \"the littlepeople\" wholive under the ground. Irish legends tell of the sexual relationshipsbetween theancient Milesians and the Tuatha de Danaan, the Irish \"undergroundgods\" whofled into the Earth and settled there. St Patrick, who \"removed thesnakes fromIreland\", is said to have seen one of these underground people, a\"fairy woman\",coming out of the cave of Cruachan. When St Patrick asks aMilesian about her, hereplies: \"She is of the Tuatha de Danaan who areunfading., .and I am of the sons ofMil [human Irish], who are perishable andfade away.\" The usual tale of mortalityand immortality. As Michael Mott reports,Daniel Bradley and other geneticists atthe Trinity College in Dublin havediscovered that the oldest \"pure\" racial bloodlinein Europe continues to existin the far west of Ireland. This, as I highlight in TheBiggest Secret, is alsothe last bastion of an ancient Irish language called Gaelic,which isastonishingly similar to languages of North Africa, such as Libyan. Bradleytoldthe Reuters news agency in March 2000 that the Irish came from a race thatwasdifferent to other Europeans. He said: \"When you look at this oldgeneticgeography of Ireland what you find is that in the west (of Ireland) weare almostexclusively of one type of Y chromosome.\" They found that 98% of menwith Gaelicnames in western Ireland had this particular chromosome. If anyone isstill in doubtthat the legends of the \"fairy\" people and the \"extraterrestrial\"accounts of todayare describing the same entities, Michael Mott summarises herethe commonattributes of the underground peoples of global folklore:\"They are mostly reptilian or reptilian humanoids or \"fair\" and Nordic; theyaretelepathic with superior mental powers; they can shape-shift and createillusions;they want to interbreed with humans and need human blood, flesh, andreproductivematerials; they have advanced technology; they have the secret ofimmortality; theycan fly, either by themselves or with their technology; theymostly have a malevolentagenda for humans; they cannot survive for long indirect sunlight; they have beenbanished from the surface world or are in hidingfrom surface people and/or the Sun;they want to keep their treasures, knowledge,and true identity a secret; they covertlymanipulate events on the surface world;they have surface humans working for themthrough the priesthoods, cults, andsecret societies; they have a putrid smell like\"sulphur and brimstone\".The accounts are incredibly consistent over thousands of years. Mott writes:\"The reptilian aspect of some underworlders permeates folklore. Oneuniversaltheme that recurs in the folktales of many, many cultures is that ofthe snake-husband or snake-wife, who can transform into a \"human\" or humanoidform and isinvariably (of course) of royal blood among his or her own kind (talkabout the270Children of the Matrixultimate pick-up line!). Often the snake or serpent-man exacts a promise ofmarriage,or the hand of an unborn human child in betrothal, consistent with thetheme of thesubterranean's interest in maintaining their own genetic diversity.\"A variant of this should be familiar to most readers of fairy tales, in theform of 'TheFrog Prince'. The frog-prince is a Handsome Prince, but like theJapanese seducingdragon, he has a reptilian or amphibian form. The underworldlink is complete, forfrequently the frog lives in a deep well, from which he isdiscovered or rescued by thefemale protagonist. A possible connection is evidentin the Scandinavian belief thatsome dwarves would 'turn into toads\", if caughtby the Sun, much like Mimoto's loverturned from a man into a 'dragon' when thesame thing happened. Slovenia has itslegends of fairies and 'little people', butSlovenian fairy tales are also permeated bythe presence of the 'Snake Queen', agreat, white, cave-dwelling creature who is partwoman and part serpent. Theserpentine-yet-human Nagas are still believed by devoutHindus and some Buddhiststo dwell beneath India, Nepal, and Tibet.\"23Denying the obviousWhen you read and hear the horrendous accounts of the victims and witnesses ofthegrotesque reptilian agenda, ancient and modern, it is hard to comprehend howsomany \"researchers\" and New Agers continue to believe that this\"extraterrestrial\"presence is good for humanity and a sign of positive change.Now, of course, not all\"extraterrestrials\" or interdimensionals are malevolent,but does that mean that wehave to ignore the fact that some of them are? 1 havehad \"researchers\" attack mewho appear far more concerned with the effect of mywork on the image of reptiliansthan they are with the horrors being perpetratedon abductees, mind-control victims,and the people of the world in general. DrDavid Jacobs in his book, The Threat, picksup this point. He calls such people\"the Positives\":\"Often the New Age Positives band together into almost cult-like groups todefendthemselves from their detractors - researchers and abductees who have cometodifferent conclusions about the abduction phenomenon. The Positives reinforceoneanother's feelings and insulate themselves from the terror of their lives;they becomeangry when \"less enlightened\" abduction researchers question theirinterpretation.\"24Certain researchers in England, Las Vegas, and the United States in generalcomeimmediately to mind. Dr Jacobs also names some of the \"stars\" ofextraterrestrialresearch like John Hunter Gray, Dr Leo Sprinkle, Dr RichardBoylan, JosephNyman, and Harvard professor, Dr John Mack, among those who wantto put apositive twist on the abductee reports:\"Both Boylan and Mack de-emphasize the effects of the standardabductionprocedures. Boylan believes that gynaecological and urologicalprocedures take placeonly with a very small number of abductees and he rarelyfocuses on them. Andalthough Mack has found nearly the full range of alien physical, mental,andreproductive procedures, he only mentions them in passing while emphasizingwhat hefinds to be spiritually uplifting elements. The benevolent 'spin' thatthe Positives (bothabductees and researchers) put on the abduction phenomenon ispuzzling, given theway most people describe their abductions: being unwillinglytaken; being subjected topainful physical procedures (sometimes leavingpermanent scars); enduringhumiliating and abusive sexual episodes, includingunwanted sexual intercourse; livingwith the fear and anxiety of wondering whenthey will be abducted again.\"25James Bartley, the abductee and researcher of the reptilian connection, israthermore blunt in his appraisal of what he calls \"the Muppets\" - those whoeitherrefuse to see the malevolent nature of the reptilian agenda or activelyseek toportray it in a positive light. He says the reason why so many abducteesarehopelessly confused about this whole mess is because trigger mechanismshavebeen programmed into them to keep them from getting at the truth oftheirexperiences. He says he has witnessed countless times how an abducteewillimmediately fall asleep the moment the lecturer begins talking about\"fear-based\"issues. But when he or she attends a lecture by a channeller or someother \"lightworker\" saying positive things about the \"aliens\", the abductee isbright andattentive, and awake during the whole lecture. \"Falling asleep is justone biggermechanism,\" he says. Another is annoyance or anger at the \"fear-based\"lecturer orabductee. Likewise an overwhelming compulsion to get up and walk out,to get upand eat, to get up and smoke a cigarette, getting nauseous, a headacheetc., etc. Inan article challenging the methods of researcher and lecturer, DrRichard Boylan,Bartley goes on:\"Boylan...[promotes]...the ludicrous notion that a woman abductee wasmerelysuffering from spiritual retardation and was mentally incapable ofunderstanding the'benevolent' nature of the horrific and unwantedexperimentation that was beingconducted on her...We have worked with countlesswomen who have suffered painfuland bloody haemorrhages, sometimes lasting fordays, after the 'benevolent ET’doctors had made an unwanted house call. What,the discerning human must ask,does profuse and painful bleeding have to do with’spiritual’ evolution? The New AgeLa-Dee-Dahs claim that there is no such thingas Evil or Demons, which makes [them]the butt of endless jokes by Witches,Warlocks and Satanists throughout the worldbecause the latter derive their powerfrom demonic entities.\"By constantly blaming 'the military’ and the 'globalist industrialists', thereptilianpropagandists condition the abductees into believing that all humaninstitutions arebad and that the only hope one has to reach the... 'next levelof consciousness,evolution, vibratory frequency' et al, is to look to the skiestowards the same darkgods who are responsible for their current state ofspiritual enslavement. Never mindthat for the most part these ’Globalists andMilitarists' are part of the same oldfraternal orders, which worship thepatriarchal serpent gods and in many cases are272 Children of the Matrixhosts for reptilian entities themselves. These hosts and their fellowtravellersoperate as a Fifth Column here on Earth to set the stage for thereturn of theDark Reptilian Gods.\"The so-called UFO Research Community is awash with these 'Muppets'. Even Ihaveto laugh at the irony of it: literal hosts for reptilian entitiesfacilitating abducteesupport groups, lecturing at so-called 'UFO Conferences'and speaking on the Art-BellShow [the major \"mysteries\" radio show in the US].This is so because of the longterm genetic and soul matrix manipulation of thehuman race.''26How right he is and how fast the human race needs to wake up and grow up.Thestories I have featured in this chapter are just a small selection of thereportsand personal accounts describing reptilian experiences.

Unless people wish to enclose their minds inconcrete,clearly something very strange is occurring on Planet Earth and hasbeen doingso for many thousands of years.There are so many questions and the more you know the more there is to know.Butat this point in the journey it can be firmly stated that there is aconsiderablereptilian connection to ancient and modern control and manipulationof the humanrace. That is not to say all reptilians in all existence, just someof them. But then weneed to ask about the consciousness that incarnates into thereptilian stream becausein the end the decisions of action and behaviour aretaken by consciousness. Atthat level the reptilian genetics, or insectoid,Nordic, and grey genetics, are only anouter shell that consciousness inhabits.So while we talk about the world beingmanipulated by reptilians, that is onlyone level of this. There is a consciousnessthat inhabits some reptilian formsbecause that genetics most suits the state ofbeing of this consciousness. Inother words, it operates through primal survivalinstincts rather than feelingsand emotion. This state is reflected in reptiliangenetics on the animalisticlevel and so the consciousness and the genetics arecompatible. Then, throughthese reptilian bodies, this consciousness manipulatesand possesses humanity. Weare back to the Russian doll system again, one insidethe other as we move downthe frequencies. The manipulation of this world goesbeyond the fourth densityrange and at least into the fifth. So who, or what,controls the reptilians?Consciousness makes the decision, based on its state of being, of what formandbloodline to inhabit on the endless journey of evolution through experience.Aswith everything, our current state of being naturally attracts, or isattracted to, thephysical form and experiences that are compatible with where weare coming from,mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. There is a vibrationalsynchronisation -275magnetism you might call it - between the frequency of the consciousness andthefrequency represented by the DNA of the body. The base reptilian nature,asexpressed through the reptilian genetics, includes the desire for top-downcontrol,emotionless \"cold-blooded\" attitudes, an obsession with ritualisticbehaviour, andso on. This reptilian DNA will naturally attract consciousness oflike reality anddesire. This consciousness is not \"reptilian\" in or of itself,it just takes a reptilianouter form. Consciousness is pure energy, an aspect ofthe infinite whole, theinfinite \"I\". But it takes a reptilian genetic expressionin the lower densities if thisDNA is a match for its own vibrational state ofbeing. As it evolves beyond thoselimitations of vision and perception, it beginsto incarnate into other forms, or hasno need for the lower densities at all.Some members of these Illuminati bloodlines,who are challenging the agenda fromwithin, have confirmed these themes to me.One member of the \"royal\" Plantagenetbloodline (connected to the de Veres andthe Houses of Anjou and Lorraine), toldme:\"We all begin as the smallest fragment of energy - barely a spark - and evenbeforeconsciousness, we seek to unite with other sparks, like a moth seeking thelight. Atthe point we realize we are separate, we attain consciousness, andcontinue to seekto unite with other consciousness. By this time, we are what Icall light balls - ourtruest conscious nature. Just as in Darwin's evolution, wedevelop into more thanjust a light ball. But this does not happen over millionsof years. Rather it happens ina single moment of clarity, a flash ofconsciousness. The vehicle for thistransformative growth is reincarnation.\"So those that people call the reptiles got to the reptile level of developmentandstopped. Some go on [and evolve beyond that]. Those who continue to takethereptile form do so because of the limitations of what they believe theiroptions are -they're creating their own reality. Also, for those at that level,it isn't that they don'tknow. It is indeed their sheer pleasure inself-gratification and self-focused existence.For this reason, I do not like theterm reptile because it implies they are somethingother than the rest of us(light balls), and that is, indeed, THEIR reality. So I prefer aterm whichreflects their state of consciousness, dino-brain.\"1These points are soooo important in understanding the cosmic game and wherethereptilian form fits in. The particular reptilian genetic stream 1 amhighlightingin this book represents a lower level of development in theevolution ofconsciousness. It is the level at which fear dominates and there isno greaterexpression of fear than the need to control others and dictate theirbehaviour inrelation to you. This reptilian stream also represents the need forconsciousness togratify the physical senses at the suppression of all else,including spiritualdevelopment and enlightenment. Consciousness in that statewill be attractedto the reptilian genetics represented by the Illuminatibloodlines. If suchconsciousness gets stuck in this evolutionary groove and doesnot break this cycleof thought and behaviour, it will be doomed to incarnatinginto the same276Children of the Matrixbloodstreams over and over because like attracts like. This is what has beenhappening. For this reason high consciousness has also been incarnating intothesebloodlines through these thousands of years in an effort to rewire the DNAandresonate it to a higher vibrational state. Our attitudes and spiritualdevelopmentchange the DNA we are occupying with every thought and feeling, positiveornegative. This could be the real meaning of the Biblical claim about the\"sins\" ofthe fathers being visited upon the children. Perhaps Princess Diana,whoincarnated into a reptilian-hybrid bloodline (although more Nordic dominatedinher case), was one of these souls who came to break these prison frequenciesin theIlluminati DNA. In the same way, there are reptilian bloodlines that havemovedbeyond the base state of the Illuminati genetic codes and this reptilianDNA hasevolved to a higher level of knowledge, understanding, and, therefore,frequency.Crucially, it has developed an emotional \"warm blooded\" nature, and the abilitytofeel and express love. Thus consciousness that mirrors this DNA frequency bandisattracted to these bloodlines. These are the \"good guy\" Serpent People thatare alsodescribed in the ancient texts, and there are many of them around todaytrying tohelp humanity - and the Illuminati reptilians - out of their mental, emotional,andspiritual prisons. Please keep this in mind when I talk of the reptilianconnection tothe Illuminati and the Satanists.Food for the demonsOne of the great difficulties that people have in grasping the enormity of whatishappening is that they find it so hard to lift their imagination beyondthetechnology and range of possibility they see around them. It is the\"that-is-not-possible-because-I-haven't-seen-it mentality. Shape-shifting is one example, andIunderstand this from the conditioned version of reality. Of course it soundsfantastic, but so many people have experienced this phenomenon all over theworld over thousands of years to the present day that to dismiss it wouldbeludicrous. The idea of interdimensional travel is just some science fictionbabble tomost people and yet it is in understanding the interdimensional natureof Creationthat so many of the answers lie. I do not dismiss for a moment the claims ofphysical reptilians and greys living within the planet in the underground basesand tunnel networks. That is clearly true from the explosion of ancient andmodernaccounts, and at the point of interface with surface humanity that is avital aspectof this story. However, it is the interdimensional rather than the purelyextraterrestrial and inner-terrestrial, which holds the key to unlocking themysteries. The reptilian hybrid bloodlines have been created, in my view, foroccupation by fourth, maybe also fifth, dimensional reptilian and other entitiesandit is they who are controlling the Illuminati. Indeed at the peak of thepyramid,they are the Illuminati. Satanic and secret society rituals are designed tocreate themeans through which these mostly lower fourth-dimensional entities can possessthe body of the initiate and also manifest directly in \"physical\" form. Duringthesacrifices the physical reptilians and hybrids consume the organs of thephysicalbody, especially the heart, and drink the blood of the victim. At the same time,the277lower fourth-dimensional \"demons\" or psychic vampires absorb the deeplynegativeenergy generated by such horrors. The vibrational frequency of negativeemotion,like fear and terror, resonates to the lower fourth-dimensional range ordensityand so those emotions generate energy for the fourth-dimensionalreptilians anddemonic entities. Energy = creative power, positive or negative.They are feedingoff our emotions and they manipulate events in the world andour lives to diggerthe desired emotional responses. Ancient Chinese philosophersclaimed that humanswere \"Moon food\" because their energy was being drainedand absorbed by anexdaterresdial force that needed the energy to replenish itself.Researcher AlanWalton puts it like this:\"...the 'serpent race' will merely continue to do what it has always done withthe'human cattle' on this planet, which is to continue to feed on us likeemotional,psychic and bioplasmic vampires and work to destroy our spiritual lifeand thusindividuality until we are assimilated into their hive via psionicimplants just as theyhave done with many other humans beyond this world, manywithin the undergroundmilitary-industrial networks, and with many of the’abductees’ of recent years. Andnot only psychic assimilation, but alsosupernatural possession (by rep-oltergiestparasites) and also geneticassimilation as well...\"What if these 'wer-dracs', 'repti-poltergiests', 'demon-aliens', or whateverone mightwish to call these serpentine sorcerers, had became adept over time atsuperficialmolecular shape shifting as the indwelling 'poltergiest' or 'astralparasite' literallyabsorbed, consumed, devoured, or assimilated the reptilian'host' from the insideout? What if in addition to this they were able to projectsome type of hypnotic orpossibly laser-type holographic field around themselvesso as to be able tointermingle with humans, undetected for what they reallywere?\"2This is precisely what they have done. There are so many reptilian\"hosts\"(possessed people) in positions of political, financial, media, andmilitary power.They may look human, but behind their outward appearance they arenot. Thereason the Illuminati are so obsessed with bloodline is that the hybridgenetics werecreated to make these bodies more easily possessed by the lowerfourth-dimensional entities because of the vibrational compatibility. It meansthat if youcan put these bloodlines into positions of power, you are, in truth,putting theseentities into power. This way they can control this physical worldfrom theirdimension while the human population think humans are governing them.TheUnited States of America is not governed by Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, orany\"president\". Americans are governed by the reptilian entity that possessesthebodies we call Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. The John Carpenter movie,TheyLive, says it all, really. This is why two of Cathy O'Brien's mindcontrollers, Bill andBob Bennett, told her they were \"alien to this dimension -two beings from anotherplane\". Remember that when Cathy saw people transformfrom physical humans to\"lizard-like aliens\". Bill Bennett said:278Children of the Matrix\"Welcome to the second level of the underground. This is a mere mirrorreflection ofthe first, an alien dimension. We are from a trans-dimensionalplane that spans andencompasses all dimensions...! have taken you through mydimension as a means ofestablishing stronger holds on your mind than the Earthplane permits.\"3The Illuminati, Satanism, and the serpent cult of the ancient texts are thesameorganisation. The most important hierarchy within the Illuminati is not thatofpolitics, banking, or whatever. Your position is decided by the \"purity\" ofyourbloodline and the level at which you operate within the global network wecallSatanism. In other words, the power of the \"demons\" that have takenpossession ofyou during Satanic ritual. In this way, the other-dimensionalhierarchy is reflectedin the \"human\" hierarchy of the Illuminati. These demonsfight among each otherfor power all the time and this is experienced within theIlluminati through theirinternal squabbles. The wars between these reptilianbloodlines over the years havebeen the wars between demonic entities for theright to be top dog, or demon, onEarth. This is also one origin of the ancientaccounts of the great rivalry among the\"gods\". In ten years of full-timeresearch I have met many former Satanists and thevictims of Satanism and I willsummarise the themes that have been repeated to meover and over around theworld. The Satanic network is vast and if you have a faircircle of friends andacquaintances, you will know people who are Satanists. That'show widespread itis. Satanists are also very organised and, of course, extremelyruthless. Theyhave code names known only to other members and they haveamong their number allthe people they need to operate in secret and cover upanything that may gowrong. They are, therefore, very strong in the medicalprofessions, police, thejudiciary, coroners offices, politics, governmentadministration, and so on.There is tremendous infighting within Satanism, as theybattle for supremacy byseeking more and more powerful demonic entities. Theyhate each other as much asthey hate humanity. In fact they just hate, period.Anyone weak is destroyed.Weakness is considered the ultimate \"sin\" in Satanismand so is defying thedesires of the demons. The whole Satanic network is ruled byfear. Cult membersare disciplined by having to watch their children tortured,beaten to death, orbrutally raped. Others are sacrificed. Satanists are deluded intothinking thatthey control the demons when actually the demons are just usingthem as pawns.Incredible atrocities are committed by Satanists so controlled by thedemonswithin them that they lose all emotions of love and compassion. PhillipEugene deRothschild, who claims he is an offspring of a French Rothschilds, sayshe is adirect descendant of a very old culture, \"as old as Mankind itself\".Thisculture, he says, worships \"Satan as God\" and is steeped in deep violence.Heexplains how he was exposed to every abuse, trauma, and\"demonisation\"imaginable. \"This culture is unbelievably and ingeniously evil\",he says. Thetrauma, both as a victim and perpetrator, was to sharpen his\"dissociativepotential\" or Multiple Personality Disorder. He said that thisdissociation was279enforced by \"victim and perpetrator, high-tech mind control programming in theUS, often in government facilities and clinics, and at the Tavistock Institutein theUK\". The Tavistock operation, as my previous books highlight, is a centreof theIlluminati's mind control network.Human sacrifice is not confined to some barbaric period of ancient history. Itishappening all around us and I don't care where you may live. Many sacrificesarebabies produced by women called \"breeders\", who give birth in secret. Somearewilling, but many are held captive. The babies are birthed by doctors andnurseswho are part of the network. These children never appear on documentationand sothey never officially exist and cannot officially go missing. Othersacrifices arepeople the Satanists have kidnapped, a cult member being punished, and evenvolunteers from the cult. It is common for Satanists, especially the mostpowerfulones, to die in rituals designed to transfer their power and demons toanotherperson. When they die, their consciousness becomes the property of thedemons, asritually agreed when they become Satanists. The deal involves demonicpower forthe Satanists on Earth in return for their \"soul\" when they leave theirbody. This iswhere we get the term \"selling your soul to the Devil\". On otheroccasions the\"soul\" of the sacrifice will be transferred to a participant of theritual. At the pointof death, as many former Satanists have told me, the victimis fixed in an hypnoticstare - just like a snake - by the person who is going toabsorb their life force andenergy. This makes a vibrational, magnetic link,which draws the consciousness ofthe victim into the Satanist as it is releasedby death from the body. These grotesquerituals are taking place all the time andthere are hundreds of thousands, at least,worldwide on the main ritual days of the year. The dead bodies, or what is leftofthem, are disposed of via cult members who work in crematoria or are buriedinsecret mass graves. I have also heard of \"devil dogs\" that are trained to eattheremains. Horrible isn't it, but if we don't face reality it is going tocontinue andexpand. These guys are running our world for goodness sake.Blood, the physical expression of the life force, is a key aspect of therituals.Anyone who drinks blood and eats flesh absorbs the energy of that person and,inthe case of drinking the blood of someone still alive, it makes a vibrationalconnection between the two people, which allows for psychicmanipulation.Drinking human blood appears to be vital to reptilian entities tohold open DNAcodes that maintain an outward \"human\" appearance. The reptiliansalso feed offan adrenaline that enters the bloodstream at times of extremeterror. The ritual isperformed to increase this terror to its maximum at thetime of death. This way theblood they drink is full of this desired adrenaline.The consuming of the heart isalso at the centre of these sacrifice rituals andthey have been performed in the sameway for thousands of years going back toAtlantis and beyond under the control ofthe other-dimensional entities andserpent \"gods\". This ritual of cutting out andeating the human heart goes backas long as the bloodlines and can be found allover the world. The heartrepresents the very essence of who we are. The ScottishSunday Post of January2000 told the strange story of Alisdair Rosslyn Sinclair underthe headline\"Victim of Secret Holy Land Power Struggle?\" He was a Scottish280Children of the Matrix\"tourist\" who was named after Rosslyn Chapel, near Edinburgh, which was builtbythe Sinclair family, formerly the French St Clair family, which was involvedinthe formation of the Knights Templar. Alistair Rosslyn Sinclair was adirectdescendent of this bloodline. He was originally from Arran, but apparentlyhadbeen working as a musician in Amsterdam. He had researched hisbloodlineconnections and had visited Rosslyn Chapel, an Illuminati \"holy place\",a numberof times. In April 1998 he made an unexplained five-day trip to Israeland wasarrested when he tried to leave the country The authorities say he wasarrested forhaving £3,500 worth of German currency concealed in a hiddencompartment of hissuitcase, but that is not illegal. They say that he laterconfessed to buying andselling drugs, but again why would he do that when therewas no evidence? Whathappened next, however, has a very ominous ring. The policesay Sinclair hangedhimself with his shoelaces, a ludicrous claim for such a bigman, and when his bodyarrived back in Scotland an autopsy revealed that...hisheart was missing. Theauthorities say the heart was taken for closerexamination, but they offer no crediblereason why this was done or why the heartwas \"mislaid\". The Israeli investigativeauthor, Barry Chamish, claims thatAlistair Sinclair was murdered as part of a muchbigger conspiracy involvingbattles between ancient bloodlines and secret societiesfor control of Jerusalem.Chamish says that Alisdair Sinclair was killed because hebecame caught up inthis clandestine war, and he points out that the removal of theheart is part ofthe Knights Templar tradition. The dying wish of the ScottishTemplar king,Robert the Bruce, was for his heart be cut out and taken fromScotland to beburied in Jerusalem. But it is also an ancient ritual to eat the heart ofyourvictim in such Satanic conflicts and this may well have happened in thiscase.The heart is so important to these sick people.An old, old storyThe Aztecs of Mexico were so obsessed with sacrificing to their serpent godsthatthey would kill thousands in a day. Wherever you find the worship of serpentgods,you find human sacrifice. The Mayan priesthood, the Nacoms and theChacs,conducted ceremonies in which the victim was held down while his or herlivingheart was removed and offered to the gods. It was seen as the supremeoffering andit still is by the Satanists today. What happened to PrincessDiana's heart after shewas ritually murdered on that ancient Merovingian ritualsite for the GoddessDiana (Dana, Artemis) in Paris? Phillip Eugene de Rothschildalso confirms that theIlluminati Satanists today are the modern version of thesecret sects of Sumer,Babylon, and other ancient cultures. He says he wasinitiated into:\"... the oldest, most pristine form of Satanism, the oldSumero-Akkadian-Babylonianmystery religion ...Inherent in this culture is thepresence and power of demonicspirits, and they became an integral part of mylife and even my being. In a cultureaddicted to power, demonic spirits offeredthe ultimate power trip. If, in Americanculture, people are addicted to comfort,status, and prestige, in Satanic culturepeople are addicted to demonic power.281\"Satanism has pervaded western civilization ...It has been growing for thousandsofyears, quietly weaving its way through the very fabric of the culture and thepowerstructures of the nations in the West. It has adherents in all walks oflife, in allincomes, and all social strata. It has exerted a profound influenceon the intellectuallife of the West for the past several hundred years...Satanism has influencedpolitics, economics, art and music, through thespiritual-psychological process calleddissociation, and dissociation is as oldas human culture itself.\"4Satanic rituals are also performed to connect with and often manifestother-dimensional demonic entities. Whenever these manifestations are describedto methe pentagram or five-pointed star is a constant theme. Everything isenergy and allsymbols affect the vibrational frequency of energy. Thefive-pointed star within anoccult ritual creates an interdimensional gateway orportal, I am told, which allowsother dimensional entities to manifest. It isusually surrounded by a circle, which, intheory, creates a magnetic field orwall that prevents the demon from leaving thatspot. Satanists are obsessed withdemonic entities, but they are also terrified ofthem. The pentagram is a Satanicversion of beam-me-up-Scotty, and is, therefore,the most important Satanicsymbol because it allows their \"masters of the universe\"to appear to them. Nowlook at the pentagrams all around you, as on the US andother flags, and the logoof the European Union. Texaco is an Illuminati companyand its logo is apentagram within a circle with the T-square of Freemasonry in themiddle. And thecentre of a pentagram is a pentagon. This is why the headquartersof theIlluminati's US military is in a building called, and shaped like, apentagon.When you begin to understand their codes and symbols, you can read themsoclearly. For example, the Satanic sign for the \"Devil\", or their controllingforce, is aparticular hand signal. The two middle fingers are held down, usuallyby thethumb, and the two outer fingers point straight up like horns. 1 have seenmanypeople in power make this sign after a speech or in acknowledgement. Go tothepicture section and you will see three examples involving Bill Clinton duringhis firstinauguration address in 1993 and George W. Bush during his year 2000presidentialelection campaign. (See The Biggest Secret chapter, The SecretLanguage, and theSymbolism Archive on my website for more examples of Satanicsymbolism allaround us.) Satanists, like their ancient predecessors in theMystery schools, usecombinations of colour and sound to resonate the energy inthe ritual to connectwith the demonic dimensions. The sound involves humming,mantras, incantations,and specific words and phrases. The Illuminati is obsessedwith the sound of wordsrather than their spelling for the same reason.Belial/Balliol is an example. Thespelling doesn't matter, it is the sound, thevibration.Former Satanists have described to me how demonic entities manifest intherituals amid fire, smoke, and a blinding light. This explosion ofelectromagneticenergy, X-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet rays associated withinterdimensionalmanifestation could be another reason why it was said to bedangerous or fatal tolook directly at a \"god”. The effects of such fields areoften found among \"UFO\"witnesses and abductees, who develop conditions likeinflammation of the eyes.282Children of the MatrixIndeed the \"foul smell\" of \"burning sulphur\" associated with the appearanceofreptilian and other \"extraterrestrials\" to abductees, is reported in exactlythe sameway by those who have seen these demonic manifestations at Satanicrituals. Thereis a connection here for sure and many, at least many, of the\"extraterrestrials\" are infact \"inter-dimensionals\" moving into our frequencyrange and then leaving again.The descriptions of these \"demons\" often have avery familiar ring also - very tall,fiery red eyes, and reptilian in appearancewith scales, fangs, and claws. Beings likethat are commonly described, butdemonic entities manifest in many forms. Someof the reptilians and blond-haired,blue-eyed \"Nordics” could be the same entitiesin their other-dimensional forms.John A. Keel wrote in Our Haunted Planet aboutthe knowledge of this phenomenonheld by the ancients:\"Early investigators and thinkers soon realised they were dealing withmagicalbeings who could imitate man and his works. Instead of being solid,physicallystable, assemblages of cells and matter, these entities wereapparently temporarymanipulations of energy. So the word 'transmogrification'was used to describethem. These transmogrifications, according to the lore,could assume anyform...from a wolf to a cat to a house, ship, or iridescent godof awesomeproportions. They could appear clothed in rags or in gold crowns andexpensivevelvet robes. Worst of all, they had a penchant for playing all kindsof games withus, manipulating our fears and beliefs and even conning us intogoing to waragainst each other.\"5A lot of New Age channellers and psychics, who think they are connecting withthe\"light\" or \"Ashtar Command\" or something, are in fact connecting withthesefourth-dimensional \"demon\" entities, which play them like a violin. Thereports ofdemons appearing in a whoosh of fire, smoke, and light remind me ofthe stories ofthe genie in the bottle. The most famous, of course, is Aladdinand his lamp. Thecharacter of Aladdin, in fact, originated from the head of thegoddess-worshippingterrorist group in Asia known as the Assassins, whichinteracted with the KnightsTemplar. He was also called the \"Old Man of theMountain\".\" Once again theAladdin story with its genie appearing in a whoosh ofsmoke is awash withsymbolism. Thanks to the rituals of the Illuminati Satanists,the interdimensionaldoorways are opened to allow the \"genie\", the reptilian ordemon race in the lowerfourth dimension, to be free to enter this one and causeutter mayhem. The mostpowerful entities can change frequencies at will, but mostneed the vibrational helpprovided by the rituals. This theme of demonsmanifesting in fire and smoke iscommon. Ancient and modern accounts of Satanismsay the \"Devil\" materialises ina bonfire and steps forward to have sex with thewomen participants. I have heardmany accounts of entities manifesting throughthe flames. Maybe the veryvibration of fire itself creates an interdimensionalgateway. A French book,published in the 1790s, called La Secte Des Illumines,included a description ofthe rituals of the Illuminati. They are a replica ofSatanism and include once againthe theme of fire:283\"On the day of his initiation, the candidate was conducted through a long, darkpassageinto an immense hall draped with black ...Ghostly forms moved through thehall, leavingbehind them a foul odor ...His clothes were removed and laid upon afuneral pyre. Thenhis pudena [genitals] were tied with string ...Now five horridand frightening figures,bloodstained and mumbling, approached him and threwthemselves down in prayer.After an hour sounds of weeping were heard, thefuneral pyre started to burn, and hisclothes were consumed. From the flames ofthis fire a huge and almost transparentform arose, while the five prostratefigures went into terrible convulsions. Now came thevoice of an invisiblehierophant [priest] booming from somewhere below.\"7John A. Keel points out that historical records say the priests claimed to havetheability to communicate with other-dimensional beings, and that the kingsandemperors, including people like Julius Caesar and Napoleon, met withstrangebeings who materialised and dematerialised. The same goes with today'sleaderswho consult their other-dimensional demonic masters. Keel details theliterature onsecret societies that describes many materialisations of fearsomedemons, whichgave out orders and directed their followers to commit murder orpoliticalmanipulation. Those who disobeyed would be killed by the entity orfellowmembers. \"Thus,\" he wrote, \"the ultraterrestrials are able to guide andcontrolhuman events through evil men lusting for power.\"8 Exactly. Keel goes on:\"...The startling truth, as carefully recorded by the ancient historians, isthatultraterrestrials have always been in direct contact with millionsofindividuals andthat they actually ruled directly over mankind for many years. Inrecent centuries theirinfluence has become more subtle, but it is alwaysthere.\"9Only by understanding the nature of the infinite frequencies or densitiesofexistence can we begin to see the plot. We are being controlled andmanipulated onthis planet from other dimensions or densities and have been forthousands ofyears, at least. The well known writer and researcher on \"UFO\"topics, Dr JacquesVallee, asked the right questions when he said:\"Are we dealing...with a parallel universe, where there are human races living,andwhere we may go at our expense, never to return to the present? Are theseraces onlysemi-human, so that in order to maintain contact with us, they needcrossbreeding withmen and women of our planet? Is this the origin of the manytales and legends wheregenetics plays a great role: the symbolism of the Virginin occultism and religion, thefairy tales involving human midwives andchangelings, the sexual overtones of the flyingsaucer reports, the biblicalstories of intermarriage between the Lord's angels andterrestrial women, whoseoffspring were giants? From that mysterious universe, haveobjects that canmaterialize and 'dematerialize' at will been projected? Are the UFOs'windows'rather than 'objects’? There is nothing to support these assumptions, andyet, inview of the historical continuity of the phenomenon, alternatives are hard tofind,unless we deny the reality of ail the facts, as our peace of mind wouldindeed prefer.\"10284Children of the MatrixWell put, but 1 would contest the idea that there is nothing to supportthoseassumptions. The evidence is overwhelming from where 1 am sitting. I havehad somuch confirmation from countless sources over the years of the involvementinhuman sacrifice ritual of some of the most famous names on the planet. Theyattendthe rituals at the demand of their other-dimensional controllers andreceive theirorders to be carried out to the letter. They allow the demonicentities to possess theirbodies in return for fame and fortune, which, bymanipulating three-dimensionalevents and people from their fourth-dimensionallevel, these \"demons\" can usuallyprovide. But such \"riches\" are only deliveredif you serve their agenda. In the endyou are just a body to them and you will bethrown to the wolves once you haveserved your purpose. These \"contracts withSatan\" are made by politicians,bankers, businessmen, and anyone who has a thirstfor power so strong that theywill literally hand over their destiny to demonicentities. Phillip Eugene deRothschild told me how he attended these rituals fromchildhood with many peoplewho are now world famous in politics, finance, and themedia. Among them wereBill Clinton and AI Gore. He says of the bloodlines:\"All people in the occult except for a very, very small group are fully humanbeings,with both X and Y chromosomes from human mothers and father. The facialchangesyou see come from their multiple personality disorder and the demonicspiritsmanifesting through them. The antichrist and the false prophet are nothumans; theyare true Nephilim with X chromosomes from human mothers but their Ychromosomesare from the 'angels'. ...These non-human humanoids are borne as aconsequence ofhuman idolatry with Satanic \"angels\", with a little help from theIlluminist medicalresearchers.\"11Serpent worshipPhillip also says that all the top names he mentions, including theRothschilds,etc., etc., worship the snake in their rituals - \"old Satanhimself\", as he puts it.When they celebrated the old Babylonian rites, he said,they worshipped,handled, and venerated the snake and the deadlier the better. Hesaid that all his\"former brethren\", including Clinton and Gore, have the worshipof the snake incommon. \"It has always been so,\" he adds, \"from the Babylonians,to theEgyptians, to the Mayans, the Incas, the Polynesians - the commonestthread ofhuman idolatry is the snake and the dragon.\" The Satanic and secretsociety ritualsare designed for reptilian/demonic possession to take place andsuddenly, heypresto, the body of the target is now occupied by one of thesefourth-dimensionalentities. The movie, The Devil's Advocate, starring Al Pacino,portrays this verywell as the \"Devil's\" consciousness field moved from body tobody and tookthem over. People like Clinton, the Bushs, Kissinger, and theBritish royal familyare just empty vessels occupied by these characters andthat's why they act insuch unspeakable ways.285Possession through sexDuring sex the two energy fields merge, especially at orgasm, and this is acommonway that these entities take possession of people. When a possessed personhas sexwith someone, it opens up the energy connection for his or her sexualpartner to bepossessed also. This is one reason why the Illuminati encourage asexual free-for-all.There is nothing wrong with sex as such. In fact it iswonderful and we would notbe here without it. But knowing the hidden agenda isvital to avoid some seriousconsequences. People have said that\"extraterrestrials\" that abduct them or appearin their bedrooms have forced themto have sex and I am sure that these\"extraterrestrials\" are at least mostlyother-dimensional entities. It is also possiblefor fourth-dimensional \"demonic\"entities to possess a physical body and havesexual union with a human who mayalso be possessed by a similar entity. This iswhat happens in the Satanicrituals at the heart of Illuminati operations. The RomanCatholic and other\"Christian\" churches are fronts for widespread Satanic activityand child abuseand I was told by a man who has trained for the priesthood of hissexualexperience of the reptilian-Satanic connection. He said he would neverhavebelieved he would be contacting me because my work appears, at first, to beso farfrom reality. But he had now seen that conditioned \"reality\" was verydifferent towhat was really going on. He said that he was subjected to a \"veryterrifyingtraumatic experience of...unbelievable nature\". And yet, until hismindcompartments began to break down, he had no memory of it. He said he wasaseminarian studying to be a secular priest at a college in a monastery:\"On a break I went with two odd looking types (Hispanic/Oriental mix it seemed)to atown some distance away and, very briefly, I believe they were part of aSatanic groupand they performed some ritual in which I was raped by ademon...[whichseemed]...reptilian. (I have so much unconscious terror associatedwith this that Icannot recall at this time the details.) I actually suffered awound to my anal areabecause this creature/demon had barbs or horns around thebase of its penis. Sowhen it raped me, it caused a wound that never healed. Iwas so embarrassed by itfor years that I never had the nerve to have it lookedat until the latter part of mymilitary service, which determined that there wasscar tissue around the wound. Ilater married and had an operation which removedthe wound\".12The reptilians and other demonic entities are obsessed with sex because itallowsthem to possess the victim and to \"vampire\" their life force. Drugged andalcoholicstates also open people to possession, as does fear and deepdepression. Theseconnect the person vibrationally to the demonic dimensions andso the Illuminatiand their reptilian masters want people to take drugs and drinktoo much booze.Having sex with a demonically possessed person after consumingdrugs or toomuch alcohol is like opening the front door to these guys andinviting them in. A lotof illness and death is caused by these demonic attacksand when we talk of battlingwith our dark side, it is often a battle withdemonic possession or influence of somekind affecting behaviour. To survive ifyou are seeking to expose these horrors you286Children of the Matrixneed a very strong spirit and protection from spiritual forces that wish tosethumanity free. To access that protection, you just need to ask. Forces oflove do notimpose themselves on people because that would be an invasion of freewill. Theyhave to be asked.The possessed paedophilesUnderstanding the nature of such possession can explain so many of thehorrificevents that pollute this planet. At last people are beginning, veryslowly, toappreciate something of the scale of paedophilia and child abuse,although the FalseMemory Syndrome Foundation is trying desperately to keep thelid on. The scale isfar greater than anyone can imagine, but at least it iscoming more to light. Sex withchildren has been part of the Illuminati modusoperandi from ancient times. Sexualand Satanic abuse of children are aspects ofthe same agenda. Sex creates an energyconnection between the two parties, nomatter who they are, and this allows thedemonic entities in the perpetrator totake control of their victim. Trauma-basedmind control involves demonicpossession by other-dimensional entities, also.These, often reptilian, beings ofthe lower fourth dimension want to absorb theenergy of children before pubertyand orgasm because the energy is still \"pure\" andso of more use to them. Theytherefore possess people and stimulate within themthe sexual desire forchildren. When the possessed person is having physical sexwith a child, thefourth-dimensional entity is sucking out their energy and makingthe vibrationalconnection that allows the child to be controlled by the entity. Analsex withchildren is also designed to create a reaction in the child calledvaso-vagalshock. Pain and energy surges up the child's spinal chord and explodesin the brain,thus increasing the rate at which the mind \"splits\" intocompartments or amnesicbarriers. These energy vampires and mind controllers havebeen increasing theiroperations in the last few decades and so we have had acorresponding increase inpaedophilia. This is also the reason why so many of theIlluminati bloodline likeGeorge Bush, Henry Kissinger, etc., etc., have sex withchildren. All over the worldthe stories of paedophiles and paedophile rings arecoming to public attention, butthey represent a mere fraction of the abuse thatactually goes on. In The BiggestSecret I wrote about the abuse at children'shomes in North Wales and afterpublication and years of fighting for justice by ahandful of decent people, agovernment \"inquiry\" was forced to reveal the massiveand systematic abuse ofchildren at the homes for more than 30 years. However, asalways, the big fish areprotected by the system and the small fry are set up totake the consequences. Thisis why famous paedophiles and child abusers such asBush, Ted Heath, and the UKbusinessman and politician, Lord McAlpine, areallowed to escape the law (see TheBiggest Secret for the background to this andif you go to my website you will find alibrary of information exposing thepaedophile activity of the elite). The reptiliansand other non-human specieshave been abducting children for thousands of yearson a staggering scale. Thereare endless ancient legends and stories which describeor symbolise these events,not least that of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. And it is stillgoing on. Every yearmore than 2,000 children disappear in America alone every287day and many end up with Satanic cults or in the underground bases. Nowonderthey are never found. The Satanist, Aleister Crowley, emphasised whyhumansacrifice is important to these sick minds and why children are so oftenthe victims:\"It was a theory of the ancient magicians that any living being is a storehouseofenergy varying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal, andinquality according to its mental and moral character. At the death of thisanimal thisenergy is liberated suddenly. For the highest spiritual [sic] workingone mustaccordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purestforce.A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the mostsatisfactoryand suitable victim.\"13The satanic mansionsSome of the most important centres for Satanic ritual are the often Gothicmansionsand castles of the European royal families and aristocracy and theiroffshoots in theUnited States. I remember a visit to Hearst Castle inCalifornia, the vast mansion ofthe newspaper tycoon and high Illuminatiinitiate, Randolph Hearst, which is nowopen to the public during the day. It isone of the darkest places 1 have visited andstill consumed by deeply unpleasantother dimensional entities. Goodness knowswhat must have gone on there duringHearst's tenure, and perhaps still does.Hearst Castle is full of originalancient artefacts from Egypt and elsewhere and liesin a major stronghold ofSatanism between Los Angeles and San Francisco. 1 havefelt the same vibes inBritain at places like Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, theancestral home of theDukes of Devonshire, and at Clivedon House, the formermansion of the SatanicAstor family. This theme was portayed by the Stanley Rubricfilm, Eyes Wide Shut,which stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and explores thesubject of Satanismamong the elite. Rubric died immediately after the movie wasfinished. Itfeatures a Satanic cult involving the high and mighty of an Americancity whomeet at a large Gothic mansion. Such places are located all over the world.InBelgium, for example, there is the Mothers of Darkness Castle where theBritishroyal family and the Illuminati elite of Europe perform many of theirmajor rituals,and there is Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where the British royalfamily spend theirsummer holidays.The isle of light - and darknessI live on the Isle of Wight, a few miles off the south coast of England, and itis aperfect example of the connection between the major vortex points andSatanism(Figure 35). The Illuminati Satanic network performs its most importantrituals atthe key vortex points on the global grid because their sickeningceremoniessuppress the frequency of the Faith's energy field and therefore keephumanity inthe same vibrational prison. It is also easier for an entity tomanifest in these inter-dimensional vortexes. The Isle of Wight has always beena sacred place for thoseWho know of the Earth's energy grid. The Druids hadthree centres for their elite288Children of the Matrix*W*' *MOirrHPicture #73 [images/img_0073.png]Figure 35: The Isle of Wight, the \"diamond isle\", off England's south coast. Asacred centre for the druidsand a massive location for Satanism today\"Arch Druids\" (hence Archbishop) in the British Isles. They were located onthe\"magical isles\", the Isle of Man, the Isle of Anglesey in North Wales, andthe Isle ofWight. Researcher Brian Desborough says that he has established thatthe firstChristian church in Britain was on the Isle of Wight and not atGlastonbury aswidely claimed. The Christian churches, especially the early ones,were located onthe major vortex points as they replaced the \"pagan\" religionwith their own. Todaythe Isle of Wight is a sacred place for Satanists becauseof its importance to theglobal energy grid. Author Mark Amaru Pinkham says thatin ancient times it wascalled the Dragon Isle\" and could be the \"pivotal vortex\"in the northern grid of theplanet. Funnily enough, so many dinosaur bones havebeen found here that theyhave opened a dinosaur museum to exhibit them! Satanismis rampant on theisland and involves famous names from the mainland BritishIsles as well asleading figures in island business, politics, police, the legalprofession, and socialservices. There are two distinct faces to the Isle ofWight (also formerly known,apparently, as the Isle of \"Light\"). There is the oneyou see and the one you don't.The one you see is a stunning landscape andseascape, the beauty that attracted mehere many years ago. But the one you don'tsee is very, very, dark indeed.The island has a massive Freemasonic network, astonishingly so for a placewithonly 125,000 people, and I had many run-ins with them in the 1980soverenvironmental issues when the Masons were manipulating planningapplicationsfor building developments that were making some of them a fortune.But since myresearch into the manipulation of the world has advanced over adecade and more,289I realised that the Isle of Wight's dark secrets went very much deeper thanthat. It isone of the Satanic capitals of the UK and probably much furtherafield. At the sametime, this beautiful island, which should be such a wonderful place to live,has,according to a local pressure group, the highest per capita rates of suicideanddepression in the entire UK and that includes the neglected slum estates ofthe UKcities. Why? Because of the highly negative energy field the people livein. And thisis caused by the rampant Satanic ritual at the vortex points, whichresonate theisland's energy field to the lower fourth-dimensional frequency. This is whattheIlluminati are doing to the planet as a whole, creating and maintaining avibrationalprison that disconnects incarnate humanity from its higher levels ofbeing. Thereare many centres for this Satanist-paedophile network on the Island, including alarge house in the countryside where children are brought to parties for gueststorape. Other ritual centres include at least one yacht club and a seafronthotel. Thechalk seam that runs from one side of the \"diamond isle\" to the other appears tobevery important to the Satanists. Some years ago, a local community worker toldtheNexus Of The World, the UK's biggest selling Sunday newspaper, about thehorrificSatanic rituals and sacrifice on the island and the involvement ofFreemasonry, localpoliticians, council administrators, hotel owners, and otherbusiness people.15But nothing was done. It was just covered up. I have spoken to others whoknowwhat goes on and the story of the Isle of Wight is horrific, but the localmedia don’twant to know.Yet again, Ted Heath, the former Prime Minister who took the UK into theEuropeanCommunity, is among those named by victims who have sufferedunbelievable abuse on the Island. Heath has been named to me by so manypeoplewho were abused and tortured by him as children. I have exposed him in TheBiggest Secret and this book as a shape-shifting Satanist who tortures andsacrificeschildren. I am told that Heath is a regular guest at the secludedPriory Bay Hotel onthe east of the Island and that former government ministerPeter Mandelson alsostays there, although I have not been able to confirm this at the time ofpublication.Mandelson is known to fellow MPs as \"The Prince of Darkness\" and hasbeenforced to resign twice from government office over financial and misuse ofpowerallegations. He has played a leading role for the Illuminati within TonyBlair'sLabour Party. Both Heath and Mandelson are members of theIlluminati'sBilderberg Group, which I will highlight in a later chapter.Co-incidentally, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, stars of Eyes Wide Shut,haveapparently been guests at the Priory Bay Hotel, according to a formerworker, andErnest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary, was staying there whenhe wrote thespeech proposing the establishment of a military alliance called theWestern-European Union, now known as NATO. The British royal family also havegreatconnections to the Isle of Wight. Queen Victoria and Albert, herhigh-levelFreemasonic German husband, had a palace built on the island calledOsborneHouse. The Satanist and Rothschild bloodline. Lord Mountbatten, wasGovernor ofthe Isle of Wight. Prince Charles is another visitor, as is PrincePhilip, who comespublicly for Cowes Week, the elite's yachting bash. Many famousSatanists visit the290Children of the Matrixisland under the guise of coming to \"sail\". Interestingly, while writing thisbook,I received an invitation from the Rothschild Insurance group to attend a\"financialconference\" at...the Priory Bay Hotel. I would have gone to have alook, butcircumstances took me elsewhere that week.Singing for satanThe Isle of Wight is just one example of an immense global network ofSataniccentres and cults involved in human sacrifice, blood drinking, and thesummoningof other-dimensional demons. Most are unknown, but some, like theChurch ofSatan and the Temple of Set in the United States, have receivedmainstreampublicity. The Church of Satan was founded on April 30th 1966 by AntonSzandorLaVey. April 30th through May 1st is one of the most important ritualdates inSatanism. LaVey's maternal grandmother came from Transylvania,legendaryhome of the blood-sucking vampire in what we call Romania. This is theregion ofDracula, and many of the most important Illuminati bloodlines areconnected withthe area. LaVey, it is claimed, discovered Marilyn Monroe workingin the stripclubs and used his contacts to make her a movie star. More like shewas a multiplepersonality mind-slave. Hollywood (Holly-wood or Helle-wood, thesacred woodof the Druids) is awash with Satanists, as is the entertainment industry ingeneral.Among LaVey's connections in entertainment and politics were PresidentJohn F.Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford, and JayneMansfield.Sammy Davis Jr was an early member of the Church of Satan and theactress JayneMansfield, who died when she was beheaded in a \"car crash\" in 1967,was a highpriestess (see picture section). Frank Sinatra was a handler andabuser of mind-controlled slaves and, as you can appreciate, Satanism andtrauma-based mindcontrol go hand in hand. One example of this was MichaelAquino. He workedwith LaVey in the Church of Satan, but later broke away andformed his ownTemple of Set. Aquino was a notorious mind programmer, named byCathyO'Brien and many others, and a top man in the US Defense IntelligenceAgency'sPsychological Warfare Division. Aquino's wife, who worked with him, iscalledLilith Sinclair. The name Lilith is a symbol of the reptilian bloodlinesand one ofthe major strands of the Illuminati's genetic web is the ScottishSinclair family,formerly the French St Clair bloodline. The St Clairs and theBlack Madonna-worshipping, St Bernard, were fundamentally involved in theformation of theKnights Templar. The Sinclair chapel at Roslyn, near Edinburgh, is a shrine totheIlluminati and includes the image of the Green Man - the representation ofBalderin the King Arthur stories. Lilith comes from Lilim or \"children ofLilith\", whichrelates to the symbolism of Set. Lilith Aquino founded the LilithGrotto in LaVey'sChurch of Satan and was a member of its Council of Nine. Theofficial Church ofSatan website outlines its philosophy:\"...we are the first above-ground organization in history openly dedicated totheacceptance of Man's true nature - that of a carnal beast, living in a cosmoswhich ispermeated and motivated by the Dark Force which we call Satan. Over thecourse of291time, Man has called this Force by many names, and it has been reviled bythosewhose very nature causes them to be separate from this fountainhead ofexistence.They live in obsessive envy of we who exist by flowing naturally withthe dread Princeof Darkness. It is for this reason that individuals who resonate[vibrate] with Satanhave always been an alien elite, often outsiders in cultureswhose masses pursuesolace in an external deity. We Satanists are our own Gods,and we are the explorersof the Left-Hand Path. We do not bow down before themyths and fictions of thedesiccated spiritual followers of the Right-HandPath.\"18No, they bow before the myths and fictions of other-dimensionalentities.Unbelievable. And it is not a choice between the right-hand path andthe left-handpath. There is another that goes straight ahead. The Temple of Setalso denies it isinvolved in anything horrific. Its website assures us:\"Regretfully there still exist some individuals whose idea of 'Satanism' islargely asimple-minded synthesis of Christian propaganda and Hollywood horrormovies [oftenmade by Satanists!]. The Temple of Set enjoys the colorful legacyof the Black Arts,and we use many forms of historical Satanic imagery for ourartistic stimulation andpleasure. But we have not found that any interest oractivity which an enlightened,mature intellect would regard as undignified,sadistic, criminal, or depraved isdesirable, much less essential to our work.\"17Of course there is nothing undignified, sadistic, criminal, or depraved,aboutMichael Aquino, the inspiration of the Temple of Set, and his mind controlandtorture of men, women, and children; nor in being involved in the USmilitary'sPsychological Warfare Division. A former mind-controlled slave with anelite groupcalled the San Diego Illuminati told me how she had worked closelywith Aquino inthe 1980s. \"He was a cold, arrogant, ugly person in heart andspirit, enjoyed usingpeople, had a weakness for young boys, and was a confirmedpedophiliac\", thesource told me. She said that Aquino had implemented\"scientific experimentation\"(mind control) at various military bases and at theestate of a Jonathan Meier, who,the source said, was the leading Illuminati\"trainer\" for new recruits in that part ofAmerica. Aquino also had an estate inGermany where he would take his leadersand the children he abused. The source,who was mind controlled to mind controlothers, said she visited there on severaloccasions.18Hitler the demonic \"host\"There is no better example of all the points I am making in this chapter thantheNazis in Germany, and no more obvious example of how the Illuminatibloodlinesare possessed by demonic entities than Adolf Hitler. As you will seein Appendix II,Hitler was almost certainly a Rothschild bloodline. We talk ofsome people beingmagnetic and having a \"magnetic personality\", and that isexactly what they have.We are all generating magnetic energy. Some peopletransmit powerful magnetismand others less so. Negative energies are just asmagnetic as positive. Those292Children of the Matrixconnected to, and therefore generating, the extreme negative vibration ofthedemonic entities will be very magnetic. You often hear highly negativepeopledescribed as having a \"fatal attraction\". This is where the magnetism andcharismaof Adolf Hitler came from. When he was standing on a public platformwith thatcontorted face and crazed delivery, he was channelling the \"reptilian\"demonicconsciousness and transmitting this vibration to the vast crowds. Thisaffected thevibrational state of the people and turned them into equally crazedagents ofhatred. It is the pied piper principle, using vibrational frequencies.As writer AlanBullock said of Hitler:\"His power to bewitch an audience has been likened to the occult art of theAfricanmedicine man or the Asiatic shaman; others have compared it to thesensitivity of amedium, and the magnetism of a hypnotist.\"19And Hermann Rauschning, an aide to Hitler, said in his book Hitler Speaks:\"One cannot help thinking of him as a medium. For most of the time, mediumsareordinary, insignificant people. Suddenly they are endowed with what seems tobesupernatural powers, which set them apart from the rest of humanity. Themedium ispossessed. Once the crisis is passed, they fall back into mediocrity.It was in thisway, beyond any doubt, that Hitler was possessed by forces outsideof himself -almost demoniacal forces of which the individual man, Hitler, wasonly the temporaryvehicle. The mixture of the banal and the supernatural createdthat insupportableduality of which one was conscious in his presence...it waslike looking at a bizarreface whose expression seemed to reflect an unbalancedstate of mind coupled with adisquieting impression of hidden powers.\"20Hitler appeared to live in perpetual fear of the \"supermen\". Rauschning toldhowHitler suffered from terrible nightmares and would wake in terror screamingaboutentities, who were invisible to all but himself. Hitler once said to his aide:\"What will the social order of the future be like? Comrade I will tell you.There will bea class of overlords, after them the rank and file of the partymembers in hierarchicalorder, and then the great mass of anonymous followers,servants and workers inperpetuity, and beneath them again all the conqueredforeign races, the modernslaves. And over and above all these will reign a newand exalted nobility of whom Icannot speak...but of all these plans the militantmembers will know nothing. Thenew man is living amongst us now! He is here.Isn't that enough for you? I will tell youa secret. I have seen the new man. Heis intrepid and cruel. I was afraid of him.\"21This is the society planned by the reptilians and their reptile-Nordic(Aryan)\"master race\" if we allow their New World Order of global control to beintroduced-Hitler's \"secret chiefs\" were demonic reptilians and others. Theobsession withhierarchy and ritual outlined there are character traits of thereptilian brain, as weshall see. One of Hitler's heroes, the writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain,alsofitted the description of demonic possession. He was an Englishman whomarriedEva, the daughter of another Hitler hero, the composer RichardWagner.Chamberlain said that he felt himself to be taken over by demons and hisanti-Jewish, pro-Aryan books were written in a trance or \"fever\". In hisautobiographyhe said he did not recognise much of his writing as his own.Chamberlain becameprincipal adviser to Kaiser Wilhelm (bloodline) and urged theking to go to war in1914. Little more than 20 years later the forces thatpossessed Chamberlain alsopossessed Adolf Hitler as he triggered the secondworld war of the 20th century.Hitler's behaviour was extremely indicative ofdemonic possession, including hisstrange epileptic-like fits. Others close toHitler said that the Fuhrer woke up in thenight screaming and havingconvulsions. He would call for help and appeared to behalf paralysed. He wouldgasp to the point of suffocation and often when fullyconscious he would point toapparently empty space and scream: \"He is here.There! In the corner.\"After Hitler moved to Germany, he spent a lot of time in Bavaria, from whencetheBavarian Illuminati had sprung and he returned there after the First WorldWar.That's the official line, anyway. Bavaria is a massive centre for theIlluminati. Thefollowing year he came across a tiny and rather patheticpolitical party called theGerman Workers Party. This was an offshoot of anesoteric secret society called theGerman Order, which was seriouslynationalistic and anti-Jewish. Out of this Ordercame other similar societies,including the infamous Thule-Gesellschaft (ThuleSociety) and the Luminous Lodgeor Vril Society. Hitler was a members of both.Thule comes from the name given bythe Greeks and Romans to the frozen northernregion of the Earth. They calledthis land Thule or Ultima Thule. Vril was the namegiven by the English writerand high Illuminati initiate, Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to the force in theblood, which, he claimed, awakens people to their truepower and potential tobecome supermen. For blood read DNA. Bulwer-Lytton wasa British colonialminister heavily involved in imposing opium addiction on theChinese. He was aclose friend of the British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli (anassociate ofthe Rothschilds) and the writer, Charles Dickens. He was Grand Patronof theEnglish Rosicrucian Society that included Illuminati agents Francis BaconandJohn Dee among its earlier membership. He was also a Grand Master of theScottishRite of Freemasonry and the head of British Intelligence. One of hisoperatives wasHelena Blavatsky, a contact told me, and Bulwer-Lytton is oftenreferred to in herbook, Isis Unveiled. He is best known for his work, The LastDays Of Pompeii, buthis passion was the world of esoteric magic. So what is thisVril force in the bloodthat Bulwer-Lytton wrote about? It was known by theHindus as the \"serpent force\"and relates to the genetic make-up of the body thatallows shape-shifting andconscious interdimensional travel. The Vril force is,yet again, related to thereptile-human bloodlines.Another big influence on Hitler was the Bulwer-Lytton novel The Coming Race,inwhich he wrote of an enormous civilisation inside the Earth, well ahead ofourown. These underground supermen would, according to Bulwer-Lytton's novel,294Children of the Matrixemerge on the surface one day and take control of the world. Many Nazisbelievedthis. The themes of underground supermen or \"hidden masters\" can befound inmost of the secret societies and in legends across the world, as we haveseen.Certainly this was true of the Order of the Golden Dawn founded by DrWynnWestcott, a Freemason, and S.L. Mathers. They called their masters the\"secretchiefs\" and devised rituals to contact them. In the 1890s there weretemples of theOrder of the Golden Dawn in London, Edinburgh, Bradford,Weston-Super-Mare,and Paris, where Mathers made his home. One of their secretsigns was the pointedarm salute that the Nazis would use when saying \"HeilHitler\". Remnants of theOrder of the Golden Dawn continue to this day, but theoriginal version splinteredafter a row between the Mather faction and theSatanist, Aleister Crowley, whichsplit the membership. Crowley then becameinvolved with the Order of OrientalTemplars or OTO In 1933, the rocket expert,Willi Ley, fled from Germany andrevealed the existence of the Vril Society andthe Nazi's belief that they were tobecome the equals of the supermen in thebowels of the Earth by use of esotericteachings and mind expansion. Theybelieved this would re-awaken the Vril forcesleeping in the blood. The initiatesof the Vril Society included two men whowould become famous Nazis, HeinrichHimmler and Hermann Goering. Vrilmembers were convinced they were in alliancewith mysterious esoteric lodges inTibet and one of the so-called unknownsupermen, who was referred to as the\"King of Fear\". Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputyfuhrer until he made his ill-fatedflight to England in 1941, was a dedicatedoccultist and a member, with Goering, ofthe Edelweiss Society. This was a sectthat believed in the Nordic master race - theNordic-reptilian hybrids 1 call theAryans. Hess worshipped Hitler as the\"Messiah\", although how he could do thiswhen the Fuhrer was hardly blond-haired and blue-eyed was not clear. The Naziswere manipulated by their demonicmasters to instigate breeding programmesbetween the blond-haired, blue-eyed,Nordic bloodlines.A founder of the Thule Society was Rudolf Glauer, an astrologer, who changedhisname to the grand-sounding, Baron von Sebottendorff. His demands for arevolutionagainst Jews and Marxists turned the Thule Society into a focus for theanti-Jew,anti-Marxist, German master-racers. Out of all this came the GermanWorkersParty, which would become the Nazi Party. Another committed occultistand friendof Sebottendorff was highly significant. This was Dietrict Eckart, aheavydrinking, drug-taking writer, who believed he was here to pave the way foradictator of Germany. He met Hitler in 1919 and decided he was the one, theMessiahhe was looking for. It is Eckart who is credited with Hitler's advancedesotericknowledge and the black magic rituals that plugged him so completelyinto thedemonic reptilians. From now on, Hitler's power to attract support grewrapidly.Eckart wrote to a friend in 1923:\"Follow Hitler! He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We havegiven himthe means of communication with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall haveinfluencedhistory more than any other German.\"22295Other significant thinkers and groups that influenced the gatheringNaziphilosophy were two German esoteric magicians, Guido von List and LanzvonLiebenfels. At the summer solstice, List used wine bottles on the ground toform thesymbol of the Hermetic Cross, also known as the Hammer of Thor. It wasthe badgeof power in the Order of the Golden Dawn and we know this symbol astheswastika, an ancient Sun symbol of the Atlanteans-Phoenicians. Theoriginalswastika was right-handed which, in esoteric terms, means light andcreation, thepositive. The Nazis reversed this to symbolise the left- hand path- black magic anddestruction. Lanz von Liebenfels (real name Adolf Lanz) usedthe swastika on a flagthat flew over his temple overlooking the Danube and forthese two blackmagicians it symbolised the end of Christianity and the dawningof the age ofblond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan supermen. They believed in the racialinferiority ofthose they called the dark forces, such as the Jews, Slavs, andNegros. Liebenfelsrecommended castration for these people. The two vons, Listand Liebenfels, wereto have a massive influence on Adolf Hitler. In 1932, withHitler on the verge ofpower, von Liebenfels would write to a fellow believer:\"Hitler is one of our pupils ...You will one day experience that he, and throughhim we, will one day be victorious and develop a movement that will make theworld tremble.\"23Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, was another dedicated occultist whowasinto all matters esoteric. He used this knowledge in the blackest of ways.Himmlerwas particularly interested in the rune stones. This is a system ofdivination inwhich stones, carrying symbols, are thrown or selected and thechoice orcombination read by an expert. It was Himmler who formed the notoriousSS and,as with the swastika, he chose an esoteric symbol for his horrificorganisation. Thiswas the double S or \"sig rune\", which looks like two flashesof lightning. The SSwas a virtually self-contained body and the epitome of allthe esoteric knowledge inwhich the Nazis believed so passionately. Only thoseconsidered racially pure wereallowed to join, and instruction in the esotericarts, including the rune stones, wasfundamental to their training. The SS wasrun and governed as a black magic secretsociety. Their rituals were taken fromothers, such as the Jesuits and the KnightsTemplar. The highest-rankinginitiates were the 12 members of the Grand Council ofKnights led by the 13th,their Grand Master Heinrich Himmler. Their black ritualswere performed at theancient castle of Wewelsberg in Westphalia. They celebratedthe rituals of theNordic pagans and the summer solstice. Here they worshippedSatan/Lucifer/Set,whichever name you prefer. Prince Bernhard of TheNetherlands, a reptilianHabsburg and Merovingian bloodline, was a member of theSS. Bernhard was one ofthe founders of the Illuminati front, the Bilderberg Group,and is an extremelyclose friend of Prince Philip. The esoteric arts pervaded all thatHitler and theNazis did, even down to the use of pendulums on maps to identifythe positions ofenemy troops. The mass rallies that Hitler used so effectively weredesigned withthe knowledge of the human psyche and how it can be manipulated.296Children of the MatrixIn the book, Satan And Swastika, Francis King says:\"Hitler's public appearances, particularly those associated with the NaziParty'sNuremberg Rallies, were excellent examples of this sort of magicalceremony. Thefanfares, military marches, and Wagnerian music, all emphasised theidea of Germanmilitary glory. The mass swastika banners in black, white, andred, filled theconsciousness of the participants in the rallies with nationalsocialist ideology. Theballet-like precision of the movement of the uniformedparty members, all acting inunison, evoked from the unconscious the principlesof war and violence, which theancients symbolised as Mars. And the prime ritualsof the rallies - Hitler clasping toother banners the 'blood banner' carried inthe Munich Putsch of 1923 - was a quasmagical ceremony designed to link up mindsof living Nazis with the archetypalimages symbolised by the dead nationalsocialist heroes of the past.\"The relio-magical aspects of the rallies were emphasised by the fact that theirhighpoints were reached after dusk and took place in a 'cathedral of light' - anopenspace surrounded by pillars of light coming from electric searchlightspointedupwards to the sky. If a modern ritual magician of the utmost expertisehad designedthe ritual intended to 'invoke Mars', he could not have come up withanything moreeffective than the ceremonies used at Nuremberg.\"24And what applied then, applies now. The esoteric knowledge used by the Nazisformass hypnosis on the German people is being used today to expand theglobalhypnosis within the human race. Symbols, words, colours, sounds, andtechniquesof which the public are not even aware are being used in the media andinadvertising to hypnotise us. The propaganda ministry of Joseph Goebbelswasbased on the esoteric knowledge of the human psyche. He knew that peoplewouldbelieve anything if you tell them often enough and if you can engineerevents whichcreate the \"something must be done\" mentality in the public mind. Heusedcolours, symbols and slogans to great effect. The slogans were used likemantrasand were repeated over and over again, hypnotising the mass psyche.Allalternative views and information were censored and the people wereprogrammedto respond as desired. What is the difference between that and theconstant drip,drip of inaccurate and biased information that is fed to us andour children by themedia day after day? It may not have a swastika on it, but itis still mass hypnotism.It would seem to be a contradiction that Hitler soughtto destroy secret societies likethe Freemasons and to prevent the use ofesoteric knowledge in German society, butit isn't. He knew as much as anyone ofthe power available to those with thisknowledge and he wanted to keep that forhimself. In truth, the Nazis were createdand controlled by the secret societyunderground and ultimately by the demonicreptilians. They believed the Sumeriangods were the extraterrestrial master race.They launched expeditions to NorthAfrica, Rennes-le-Chateau and Montsegur inCathar country, and to Tibet wherethey believed the underground supermen werebased. The Nazi connection with Tibetwas confirmed when the Russians arrived inBerlin at the end of the war to find many dead Buddhist monks who hadbeenworking with the Nazis.The Nazis did not disappear in 1945. they just went underground or changedtheirname. The inner core of the Nazi secret society network was the BlackOrder,which continues today and is reported to be the innermost circle of theCIA. AllenDulles, the first head of the CIA, was a Nazi supporter (see .. .AndThe Truth Shall SetYou Free) and he was a key force behind Project Paperclipthat protected Nazis likeJosef Mengele after the war and took them to America.At the same time, JohnFoster Dulles, Allen's brother, was the US Secretary ofState. The Dulles family arecousins of the Rockefellers (bloodline in otherwords). Reinhard Gehlen, the manappointed by the Allen Dulles to set up the CIAnetwork in Europe, was one ofHitler's SS chiefs. Gehlen said it was not so much\"employment\" as a \"gentleman'sagreement\" with Dulles. Meanwhile, the Nazisconsidered expendable were sent tothe Nuremberg show trials, which were designedto cover up what really happened(see ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free for thedetailed story.)The two \"sides\" in IrelandWhat I have just described in relation to Hitler and the Nazis is the basicmethod ofchoosing and bringing to power the major political, economic, military,and mediafigures throughout the world. The decades of violence and civil war inNorthernIreland are not all that they seem. A contact called Jim Cairns hasspent many yearsuncovering the scale of Satanism and child abuse in NorthernIreland and the IrishRepublic (see his website athttp://www.esatclear.ie/~cairhaven). More than that, herealised that the leadersof the two \"opposing\" terrorist groups, the Catholic IRAand the ProtestantParamilitary group, the UVF, were members of the same Sataniccovens. This fitswith the evidence I have found all over the world. Again and againopposing\"sides\" turn out to be the same side - the Illuminati - when you get nearthetop. Cairns had an attempt on his life in 1994 and fled Northern Ireland. Hehasmade statements about his findings, but, of course, nothing has been done.Heestablished that the Satanic network in Ireland operates behind the cover ofthe\"Born Again\" Christian movement. \"I have no doubt that organisation isnothingmore than a Satanist organisation involved in ritual murders,\" he said.25Part of this story involves a Belfast boys' home called Kincora. This wasthesubject of a massive scandal in the 1980s when systematic abuse came to lightgoingback at least 20 years. But, yet again, the big names involved wereprotected. TheNew Covenant Times said in its January/March issue of 1994 thatthe loyalist(\"Protestant\") paramilitaries supported an MI5 British Intelligenceoperation called\"Tara\", which had the intention of creating so much violence andtit-for-tat murderby both themselves and the IRA that the UK parliament wouldagree for NorthernIreland to be absorbed by the Irish Republic. Colin Wallacewas a part-time soldierand public relations officer at the army headquarters inNorthern Ireland. Later hewas moved to another department controlled by MI5. Itwas here that he becameaware of the Tara operation and the 20 years of childabuse at Kincora involvingvery big names. When Wallace demanded to be removedfrom the project, he was298Children of the Matrixsent back to England and charged with a security offence and later unjustlyjailedfor murder. The journalist Paul Foot wrote a book called Who Framed ColinWallace?(Macmillan, Fondon, 1989). One victim of Satanism and mind control Ihave spokenwith says she remembers vividly watching a very famous politician inNorthernIreland raping a little boy in a ritual in England and when it was overhe produceda knife and cut the boy's throat. Is anyone still wondering howpeople can plantbombs in Northern Ireland that have killed and maimed thousands?These peopledo not feel the emotion we do in such circumstances. They arereptilian hybrids -on both \"sides\".Jim Cairns said that a contact had told him that the children in theKincorascandal were taken to Birr Castle in County Offally, Northern Ireland.This is thehome of the bloodline Earls of Rosse. The 1st Earl of Rosse was afounder memberof Ireland's Hellfire Club (El-fire), along with Colonel St Ledgerof Grange Mellon,County Athy. At the same time that the Earl of Rosse was aHellfire Club member in1725, he was also the Grand Master of the Freemasons inIreland. The present Earlof Rosse is the stepbrother of Lord Snowdon, the formerhusband of the Queen'ssister, Princess Margaret, and she has visited Birr onmany occasions. The HellfireClub was founded on the estate at Wycombe, north ofLondon, owned by theBritish government minister Sir Francis Dashwood, togetherwith BenjaminFranklin, an Illuminati \"founding father\" of the United States. DrFranklin, a\"devout Christian\", was also involved in the manipulation of Ireland.The HellfireClub is a Satanic network based on human sacrifice ritual (see TheBiggest Secret).Wherever you look in this story, Satanism appears every timebecause these ritualsand sacrifices are vital to the continued reptilian controlof the planet. Satanistsoperate in the pivotal positions to ensure the truth iscovered up and, as Cairnssays, the official number of Satanic ritual murders inIreland, as with everywhereelse, is a fraction of what is really happening:\"... the figures conceal the much greater and hidden spread of SatanismthroughoutIreland. The reality is, the powerful Satanic network in Ireland hasbeen able todisguise many Satanic related crimes simply because it hasinfiltrated many of theessential state bodies, police, the press, judiciary,political institutions, the churchesetc. I have no doubt that this is the casefrom the information which I have on audiotape from my cult sources. My 'BornAgain’ source tells me that top police, clergy,and politicians are Satanists.\"26This is what you find ah over the world. It is not through paranoia thatpeoplesee Satanists or their puppets in the main positions of power. The verysystemmakes it so because those who are not Satanists or under their controlareoverwhelmingly sifted out before they make it to the top jobs in theinstitutions thatdirect society. This is why the ratio of Satanists, blooddrinkers, and humansacrificers, to people in power is so astonishingly highcompared with the ratio inthe rest of the population.Calling the demons 299SOURCES1 Correspondence with the author2 http://www.reptilianagenda.com/research/r100799c.html3 Trance-Formation Of America, p 1744 Correspondence with the author5 Our Haunted Planet, pp 96 and 976 The Woman's Encyclopedia Of Myths And Secrets, pp 16 and 177 Our Haunted Planet, p 1688 Ibid, pi 609 Ibid, pi 4410 See Dimensions: A Casebook Of Alien Contact (Ballantine Books, USA, 1988)11 Correspondence with the author12 Correspondence with the author13 Aleister Crowley, Magick Theory And Practice (Dover, USA, 1929), pp 94 to 9514 The Return Of The Serpents Of Wisdom, p 25115 News Of The World, August 24th, 1997, pp 30 and 3116 http://www.churchofsatan.com/17 http://www.xeper.org/18 Correspondence with the author19 Alan Bullock, Hitler, A Study In Tyranny (Pelican Books, London, 1960)20 Herman Rauschning, Hitler Speaks (London, 1939)21 Ibid22 Quoted by J.H.

When you seewhatis happening in every community, especially to children, it defies belief.Children are major targets because the reptilians prefer the \"purity\" oftheirblood and energy, and the most effective time to start trauma-based mindcontrol isbefore the age of five or six. Changes take place in the blood atpuberty and after thefirst sexual activity, which make it less useful from thereptilians' point of view.Many schools and pre-schools for small children acrossthe world are fronts forSatanism and its offshoot, trauma-based mind control.Most of the children aresuffering every day without their parent's knowledge,but they are also handedover to the cults quite willingly by their Satanicparents. Occasionally, the odd storygets into a newspaper, but this bears noresemblance to the staggering scale of theritual abuse of children. The UKSunday Mirror revealed the abuse of a woman theycalled Kate, who was then aged34. She had been abused at a house on the outskirtsof Dublin, Ireland, since shewas three.\"I still remember the first time it happened,\" she said. \"It was evening timebecauseit was dark outside and my mother made me dress up in my best clothes. Iwasexcited because I thought I was going on an adventure. I was picked up by myauntand uncle and taken to another house somewhere in Dublin.\"I remember looking out at the city lights and feeling happy because I was outsolate. But when I got to the house I became scared because everyone was dressedindark gowns and hoods. I was stripped and made to lie down on a table in thelivingroom. It was cold and I was absolutely terrified. So I started screamingand shoutingfor my mother.\"1She was smeared with blood and assaulted again and again. She said the terrorshefelt was indescribable and she was in terrible pain. The table was surroundedbystrangers in robes and hoods holding crucifixes, chalices and knives encrusted300301with jewels and they were \"chanting in some strange language - it wasjusthorrific\". She was taken back home and she thought she was safe. Hermotherhugged her, she said, but didn't say anything. She cleaned up the bloodand treatedthe painful areas of her body. But the ordeal wasn't over. It hadonly just begun. Afew nights later it happened again. \"When 1 saw my motherbringing out my bluecoat and best shoes 1 started screaming because 1 knew whatwould happen next,\"she said. Kate Pied to speak to her parents about her abuse,but her father said shewould be taken away if she said anything:\"My uncle would knock at the door and then return to the car to my aunt to waitformy father to bring me out. Most times I'd be kicking and screaming andpleading withmy parents not to send me away. But they said nothing. They justpulled me out tothe car. Most times my father had to prise my fingers from thegarden gate.\"Kate said there were other children in the house where she was abused.Sometimesshe was forced to watch while they suffered. She said she wasconstantly afraidand could hardly sleep. She hated going to Mass because everytime she saw acrucifix, she'd have a panic attack. The enormous emotional debrisof theseexperiences led her to a life of heavy drinking, drug taking, glue sniffingand abroken marriage because she could not bear anyone to touch her. \"I hatedmyself,particularly when my body started developing during puberty. 1 wanted tolooklike a boy so 1 ate just enough to stop me from collapsing. 1 wassix-and-a-halfstone at my lowest point.\" Now this is not an isolated case. It ishappening aroundyou, in your neighbourhood now. That's the scale we are talkingabout. Rape CrisisCentres in Ireland were told so many \"bizarre\" tales of ritualabuse that a specialhelpline was created for them. Fiona Neary, the NationalCo-ordinator of the RapeCrisis Centres, said:\"We could be talking about high levels of organised abuse which could almostbebeyond the belief of many of the agencies tasked with dealing with thisproblem.Although it is unrecognised, ritual abuse does take place in Ireland andsurvivors ofthis type of abuse live here. Elaborate ritual, group activities,religious, magical orsupernatural beliefs and practices may be used to terrifyand silence children and toconvince them of the absolute power of their abusers.The purpose of these ritualsis to gain and maintain access to children in orderto exploit them sexually. Thereis also evidence that some of the groups wouldexchange children to othergroups abroad.\"2It is a vast global network, fundamentally connected to the Illuminati andthereptilians and if you read the chapters, Satan's Children and Where Have AlltheChildren Gone? in The Biggest Secret you'll see a stream of evidence tosupport this.The overwhelming majority of human sacrifice and other ritual abusegoes onunexposed and when it does come to light, the big names involved areprotected,as with Kincora in Northern Ireland and the children's home scandal inNorth302 Children of the MatrixWales. One of the most famous cases was at the McMartin Day Care Centre inLosAngeles where 369 children said they had been sexually abused. The FalseMemorySyndrome Foundation has worked extremely hard to persuade people todismiss thestories as fantasy. The children told of animals being slaughtered andotherSatanic rituals. They described how they were buried, locked in the dark,andtaken to different locations to be abused. These included a grocerystore,church, cemetery, and a crematorium. The children said they were forced todrinkblood and urine and they saw the eyes of a baby ripped out and itsbodyincinerated. Others said that a rabbit was killed in front of them to showwhatwould happen if they told their parents. The case was under investigationfor fouryears, on trial for two and a half years, involved 124 witnesses, 50,000pages oftranscript, and cost almost $23,000 a day But in the end the case fellapart andthose responsible escaped with their freedom. Crucial to the children'sstories wastheir description of a network of secret tunnels under the building,through whichthey said they were taken to be abused. It was claimed at the trialthat there was noevidence that these tunnels existed. But five months after thefiles were closed onthe McMartin case and the official cover-up completed, ateam of trainedinvestigators and excavators uncovered the tunnel system thatconnected to avaulted room under the day care centre. They extended out toadjacent buildingswhere the children said they had been taken before they weredriven to otherlocations. In 1991, an independent archaeologist also confirmedthe existence of thetunnels and an alarm system inside the centre. In otherwords, the children hadbeen telling the truth.In Britain there have been, among many others, cases in Orkney,Nottingham,Rochdale, and Cleveland. Each time the social workers trying toexpose Satanicabuse have been subjected to a blitz of condemnation by themainstream mediawith the Mail On Sunday particularly vehement in its opposition.It went so far onone occasion as to describe the \"spectre\" of Satanism as\"hysterical nonsense\". Suchremarks are so at odds with the worldwide evidencethat they can only be the workof an uninformed idiot (quite possible) or someonewho wishes the truth to remainundiscovered. As a result of such imbalancedcoverage and, of course, the stunningnature of the children's evidence, mostcases do not even come to trial. Even whenthey do very few lead to conviction.The public would rather accept the allegationsare not true because they don'twant to believe that such horrors are happening.Unfortunately they are, on avast scale, and if you go into denial about it becauseyou don't want to face thetruth about your world, then you are helping toperpetuate this unspeakabletreatment of children. As Caroline Lekiar of theNational Association of YoungPeople in Care, said:\"I can understand people finding it difficult to believe, it's extraordinary,but yet,everything is showing that it is happening. Young kids are drawing thetype of thingthat doesn't come on TV. I have been dealing with this for the lasttwo years, I havecome across many cases of ritualistic abuse and a lot of ithappens all over theplace. People have really got to wake up.\"3303The Child Abuse PyramidSon*' Salome n* : Armse Ne?woH<IPicture #74 [images/img_0074.png]Figure 36: The pyramid structure that allows widespread child abuse and Satanicritual sacrifice to becovered up. The Illuminati place their operatives in keypositions within social services, the police, judiciary,etc., to keep the lid onthese global horrorsCo-ordinated cover-upsAs I've said, Satanic ritual abuse is a global network, another pyramidofinterconnecting groups, with the high and mighty of society among theirnumber:top politicians, government officials, bankers, business leaders,policemen, lawyers,judges, doctors, coroners, publishers, editors andjournalists. The Satanic network isstructured with self-contained compartments,like the Freemasons, and rememberwhat Jim Shaw, the former 33rd degree Mason,said:\"The Mason swears to keep the secrets of another Mason, protecting him even ifitrequires withholding evidence of a crime. In some degrees treason and murderareexcepted. In other, higher degrees, there are no exceptions to this promiseto coverup the truth. The obligations, if the Masonic teachings are to bebelieved, mayrequire a Mason to give false testimony, perjure himself, or (inthe case of a judge)render a false verdict in order to protect a Mason.\"4For Satanists the severe consequences of revealing secrets or refusing tocarryout an order, are not threats, they are promises. The Illuminati and theirSatanicnetworks place their people in the major positions of power in all theareas theyneed to control to prevent proper investigation or to ensure that anyhigh-profilecase that does get to court always fails (see Figure 36). You don'tneed to control allthe policemen to stop an investigation. You just need tocontrol the person whocontrols the policemen. You don't need to control everysocial worker, just the304Children of the Matrixpeople who control the social workers. In other words, you only need to controlthevery few people who have the power to call off an investigation whennecessary.These placemen and women are controlled by the same force and so thecover-upcan be carefully co-ordinated through people who appear, to theoutsider, to beunconnected - teachers, social workers, policemen, lawyers,judges, and media. Theresults of all this for the children involved are beyondthe imagination of anyonewho has not experienced the level of trauma they mustsuffer.Zack's storyOne unfolding story 1 have featured on my website is that of Zack. He is alittle boywho attended a pre-school operated by a company called Kindercare at100Endeavor Way, Cary, North Carolina. Kindercare is the biggestpre-schoolorganisation in the United States. Zack's experience contains all theelements of theconstantly recurring reports of child abuse, both in what he sayshappened to himand the shocking lack of investigation by the authorities thatare supposed to beprotecting children. This story and all the quotes by hisparents and grandmotherare from direct correspondence and conversations withme.4 Zack said that he wastaken from the centre in Cary to a house where he wastied up and made to watchpeople sacrifice a little boy. He said that he andother children were made to drinkthe blood and eat the flesh of the dead child.He also said that they took his ownblood. He had a small circular puncture onhis elbow, which looked like a mole wasgrowing there. He said this is where theyput the \"needle-knife\" into him. He hasalso talked of large spiders he saw inmovies on these occasions and of seeing \"badmovies\" all the time. The mother ofanother boy at the centre, a four year old calledTyler, said her son had askedher if it was all right for people \"to eat each other\".Zack talked about a\"green\" party at the school in which the children were givengreen food andjuice. He said the children were given gifts at the party, but he wasgiven'poop'. When asked if anyone else got poop and he said: \"No, only me - theotherkids got cars and things like that.\" He said the sandwiches were all greenwith\"yucky mustard\" and \"there was blood\". Suzen, his grandmother, asked himwhathappened when he wouldn't eat it and he said: \"We all went to sleep.\" Healso said:\"They put blood in the oatmeal at the school.\" Hearing his mother onthe phonetalking to someone about tunnels, he said he didn't like the tunnels atschool. Hisgrandmother, Suzen, asked him what was in the tunnels and he said:\"There isblustering toys and 1 didn't want to play with them\". She asked whatthe toys didand how he played with them. He said: \"They blow everything aroundand make itcold. They like everything to be cold.\" Zack said that one of thepeople involvedwas called \"Camelot\" and he turned into a \"dragon\".His parents told me that Zack, who was just five, began to talk abouttheAnunnaki and when he was asked what they were he said they were the \"gods\".Hesaid that he learned about the Anunnaki at the \"bad school\". Hisgrandmother,Suzen, asked him if he had ever heard the word \"dingir\" (shepronounced it ding-gear), a Mesopotamian name for the Anunnaki that translatesas \"The RighteousOnes of the Blazing Rockets\". Pronouncing it ding-er, he saidit was a bad wordbecause the Dinger \"eat people skin, people blood, and people bones\". Headded:\"Their love goes away and they turn into vampires\". She asked about thename\"Knki\" and he said: \"that's a bad word\". Then Enlil - \"that's a fish word\".This fiveyear old then said: \"They're brothers, aliens, and they're from Mars.”Zack said hesaw movies about it at school and they were going to destroy theworld. The lizardslooked like Darth Maul (in Star Wars) and also the \"masks\"they had at school, hetold his grandmother. One day he saw a picture of France.He pointed to a placenear the Alps called Gorda and Verona and said: \"That'swhere the armies aresaving people for the reptiles.\" Suzen asked him where heheard about reptiles andhe said the people at the \"mean school\" told him theywere reptiles. He said:\"Aliens like to come here at Halloween and Easter. Theylike Easter.\" Suzen alsorealised that Zack pronounced words strangely as infix-ed, try-ed, and spill-ed.Zack first told his grandmother what had happened when she went to visitthefamily the week before Halloween in 1999. He later said that he did not tellhis mumand dad because the \"bad people\" had said that his parents were involvedin whatwas happening. This was untrue, but it is a technique often used to keepthe childrenquiet. Another is to tell them that they will kill them and theirparents if they talk.Zack said his teacher threatened to kill his parents as shechased him with a knifethat she kept in her pocket. He was screaming for his mumand dad and she said:\"They can't hear you. If you say anything to anyone 1 willcut your mom into piecesand burn your house down.\" As the children have seenpeople being killed in frontof them they naturally believe this would happen.Suzen said Zack was visiblyshaken and afraid to go to sleep. She and hisparents, Margo and Johnny, wrote thisoff as fear of Halloween. But on November5th, Zack's fifth birthday, he said thatsomeone had \"pulled my pants down atschool and put their hand in my body.” Hesaid the hand had \"icky stuff on it\".Suzen, a court officer for child advocacy, feltthere was much more to thesituation than they had first thought. His father Johnnytook him to a doctor anda paediatrician and both filed a report to social services.The mother of anotherchild, Tyler, who had spoken of similar experiences, did thesame. But the socialservices and police \"investigations\" were a disgrace.The investigation that never wasDetective Hoya, the head of the Cary police child crisis unit, said thatZack'sbehaviour was \"normal\". One wonders what this guy would consider\"abnormal\".Suzen called every department of child services and every time wasreferred toanother department. Finally the woman in children's mental healthasked her whatshe wanted to happen. \"I told her 1 wanted these activities tostop!\" Suzen said. Thewoman's response was that no one would take this case andthey were better offtrying to do it themselves. Finally, a chance meeting at thepolice station with thenew mayor focused the attention of the authorities. Adetective was sent tointerview the children and with him was the woman in chargeof the pre-schoolsection of social services. The detective, Stephan Lambert,seemed sincere and had atape recorder running during the entire visit. When 1spoke to him later he seemedto me to be a pawn in a game he didn't understand.Zack's father asked the woman306Children of the Matrixfrom social services how she was going to help them and she said that shewasn'tthere to help them, Suzen recalled. She was just there to talk to thechildren. Suzentold her that she wanted to tape the interviews because they werenot allowed to bein the same room. The woman refused. Suzen said:\"She took Tyler into Zack's bedroom and started asking him questions aboutwhathappened. I listened outside the door and the detective taped the entiretime. WhenTyler said that...[a lady who still works at the Kindercarecentre]...showed him herboobies and squirted him [she was post-natal], thesocial worker asked him if hismommy shows him her boobies. Being only five yearsold, his story got confused andthe interview didn't last longer than a fewminutes. When she asked for Zack, herefused to go near her or the policeman,even though the policeman seemedconcerned and stated he thought 'something weirdwas going on'\".The police and social services appeared to have little interest in pursuing thecase.During Zack's time at the Kindercare centre, he said they did something tohim withhis glasses. \"Something so bad that he will only whisper when hementions it,\"Suzen said. He has never told her what happened, except that theybroke them bystomping on them in \"poop\". Staff at the centre told Margo, Zack'smother, that hebroke them. Zack was given new glasses, but refused to wear them.He said that the\"eye doctor\" was mean and put something in his eyes that burnedso bad that hecried. The original glasses were turned over to Detective Lambertfor analysis forfaecal matter. Months later he said the SB1 (State Bureau ofInvestigation) and the SB1labs did not have the ability to test for faecalmatter. The glasses were never tested tosee if Zack's story was true and by thetime they got the glasses back, his parentswere told, the evidence would havebeen lost. Suzen also questioned a very nervousreceptionist at Cary PoliceDepartment about why they had not received a completecopy of the police report.He said they never give out the investigation notes.\"I told him that was ludicrous, I have seen many reports in my own experience! Isaid'Shame on all of you! How can you sleep at night?!' Naturally he said heslept verywell. I guess it's just the babies dreaming about depraved behaviourthat can't sleep.Is Caligula still alive or what?\"1 contacted the local police department in Cary and the case officerStephanLambert confirmed to me that an investigation into Zack's claims wasgoing on. Infact, he said he couldn't speak to me because there was aninvestigation. Then when1 said: \"So you can confirm you are investigating,\" hesaid \"No, 1 can't confirmthat.\" Only when 1 pointed out the nonsensicalcontradiction in those twostatements did he confirm that indeed he wasinvestigating. He said I could fax himmy questions and he would ask his\"superiors\" if he could answer them. I faxed thefollowing questions. (1) Whereis the tape recording of the first police visit tointerview the children? (2)Why did you tell the parents on the second visit that youwould arrest the threewomen named, thinking that [a centre employee] would turn307State's evidence, and then not do it? (3) Why for six weeks did you tell theparentsyou had to keep Zack's glasses because it was a State Bureau ofInvestigation (SBI)case, and then say the SBI does not have technology to detectfaecal matter? (4) Whydo you feel that hearing from two completely differentchildren that they saw a pre-school teacher take off her clothes does notconstitute enough to go on? (5) Why didthe parents get an incomplete policereport? Not even one word written by aninvestigator. (6) Have you sought toquestion other parents at the centre about anystrange remarks by their children?The police to this day have refused to answerany of those questions, butstaggeringly Detective Lambert told Zack's parents thathe did not interviewother parents at the centre!Does Kinder-care?I rang the Kindercare centre itself and was told by the new director that shehad noidea that such allegations had been made. Given that there was apoliceinvestigation into them, albeit an excuse for one, that was anextraordinarystatement. The director put the phone down on me when I asked otherquestions,but she did confirm that two employees (two of the three Zack hadnamed in hisstory) had left the centre. I also contacted the corporateheadquarters of Kindercarein Portland and they issued a short statement to methrough a very nervous PRperson called Kathy Vandenzanden, saying that theclaims were \"unsubstantiated\".Of course, sitting in a corporate office on theother side of America, she would haveknown. 1 faxed them this list of questions:(1) What is Kindercare doing toinvestigate the claims of these children? (2)Why, after one boy mentioned twonames at the centre as involved in his abuse,did those two people leave the centre'semployment? (3) Why did [an employee 1name] leave this Kindercare Centre?Where did she go? Is she still employed byyou elsewhere? If so, where? (4) Whydid the person the boy calls...[aname],..leave the centre after the boy told hisstory? What is this lady's fullname? Where is she now? Is she still employed byKindercare? (5) Why has a newdirector been appointed at this centre and why didshe tell me on the phone thatshe knew nothing of these allegations? (6) Is it correctthat Kindercare haverefused to allow [an employee named by Zack who still worksat the Cary centre]to take a polygraph lie detector test? Kindercare would notanswer any of thosequestions. I received a letter threatening legal action against meif I did notremove all the information about Zack from my website. Instead 1 beganto addmassively to that section by investigating the background to the ownersofKindercare with my Webmaster, Lauren Savage. Well, well, well. What did wefind?Hiding in the KravisKindercare began in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1969 and now has itscorporateoffices in Portland, Oregon. It employs 22,000 people at 1,149 centresin 39 statesand has child care contracts with the Disney and Lego organisations.It turns outthat Kindercare, the leading child-care organisation in the UnitedStates, is ownedby the empire of Henry Kravis, a very close friend of GeorgeBush, the reptilianshape-shifter, who is one of the world's most famouspaedophiles and child killers.308Children of the MatrixPicture #75 [images/img_0075.png]Figures 37 and 38: The ancient Egyptiansymbol, the Eye of Ra, used byKindercarein its publicity until this was pointed outon the David Icke website.But theKindercare pyramid with the capstonemissing remains in usePicture #76 [images/img_0076.png]Kravis is also closely connected with Henry Kissinger and the Rockefellers,bothIlluminati to their core. Anyone this close to Bush must know of hispaedophileactivities, surely? Kravis was a member of the inner circle of theRepublican Partyaround George Bush. Kravis' company, Kohlburg, Kravis, andRoberts, which ownsKindercare, made massive contributions to the RepublicanParty and the GeorgeBush campaign for the Presidency. Kravis and Roberts alsogave personally. Onefundraiser at the Vista Hotel in Lower Manhattan, co-chairedby Kravis, raised$550,000 alone for the Bush fund. In all, their combinedcontributions to Bush'selection fund totalled millions. In January 1990, a yearafter Bush's inauguration asPresident, Kravis was chairman of his InauguralAnniversary Dinner. Kravis hasalso given considerable donations to the cause ofZionism and to celebrate BobDole's birthday. Kravis threw a $300,000 fundraisingbash for Dole, the RepublicanPresidential candidate and lover of money forservices rendered.Illuminati everywhereThere is a network of Illuminati front organisations that have beenincreasinglyexposed in recent years. Among them are the Bilderberg Group and theCouncil onForeign Relations, and 1 will say more about this network in a laterchapter. HenryKravis, owner of Kindercare, is a member of the Council on ForeignRelations andhas attended meetings of theRothschild-Rockefeller-Kissinger-orchestratedBilderberg Group. He was on theguest list at the Bilderberg bash at Turnberry inScotland between May 14th-17th,1998. His second wife, Marie-Josee Kravis, asenior fellow at theIlluminati-funded Hudson Institute, is also a Bilderberger andmember of theCouncil on Foreign Relations. Her other connections include being acolumnist onthe Canadian Financial Post, a director of the Canadian Imperial BankofCommerce, Ford Motor Company, Hasbro, Inc., Hollinger International, Inc.(headedby Bilderberger insider, Conrad Black), and The Seagram Company Ltd (afiefdom ofthose major Illuminati operators, the Bronfmans). She has a number ofpublishedworks on economics, including Lessons of the Mexican Peso Crisis(January 1996),published by the Council on Foreign Relations Press. The peso crisiswas actuallymanufactured by a ring of major banks, headed by the Rockefellers'ChaseManhattan. This lady is just as connected as her husband. Quite a duo.Chase,Salomon Bros, BT Securities, and Smith Barney, who also contribute to theCouncilon Foreign Relations, appear to be involved in the financing ofKindercare.According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing byKindercare, Peat309Marwick are the company's accountants. Peat Marwick are Council onForeignRelations contributors, as are Kindercare's other auditors, Delloite andTouche.Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts, or \"KKR\", as they are known, donate to theCFR,also. Why the interest by Bush's friend Ray Kravis in the education ofpre-schoolchildren? They can surely make far more money in so many other ways.Maybe hejust wants to help children, eh? Yes, that's probably it. Kindercarealso used the Eyeof Ra, an ancient Egyptian and Illuminati symbol, in itspublicity material before 1started to investigate this (see Figure 37). When 1highlighted this on my website,Kindercare immediately removed the symbol! Butthey still have their version of thepyramid with the capstone missing (Figure38). What on earth has the Eye of Ra gotto do with pre-school educationadvertisements? And another question, whatchance do a five-year-old boy likeZack and his family have of taking on a corporategiant like this and ensuring aj ust and open investigation of their case?KKR - Koup, Kollapse it, and RunKKR are based at 9 West 57th Street, Suite 4200, New York NY 10019. In 1997,theyacquired approximately 85 per cent of Kindercare's stock. They moved itscorporateheadquarters to Portland, Oregon, after the takeover. David Johnson,the CEO ofRed Lion Inns, a KKR company based in Portland, became the new CEOofKindercare. They also replaced virtually the entire corporate staff. Kohlburg,Kravis,and Roberts are a New York \"investment firm\" specialising in leveragedbuyouts,which are often hostile, and they use massive amounts of borrowed money.Theyoften result in the dismemberment and/or bankruptcy of once solventcompanies.KKR is Jerome Kohlburg Jr, Henry Kravis, and his cousin GeorgeRoberts. Its dealshave included RJR Nabisco ($25 billion), Beatrice Foods ($6billion), Safeway ($5billion), and Owens-Illinois ($4 billion). Dealingcontinued in the 1990s with theBank of New England, K-1II Holdings (consumermagazines), and TW Holdings(Denny's and Hardee's restaurants). Other holdingsinclude American Re-insurance, Duracell, First Interstate, Fred Meyer, Stop &Shop, Union TexasPetroleum, and Walter Industries, according to Hoover'sHandbook of AmericanBusiness 1993. KKR has also acquired the publishing andmedia operation,PRIMEDIA (which has included magazines like New Woman andSeventeen); onlinemortgage lender Nexstar; Regal Cinemas, which have more than4,100 screens atabout 430 theatres in more than 30 states; and the controversial\"in-schools” TVnetwork, Channel One. Foreign subsidiaries picked up in thetakeovers haveincluded Del Monte Malaysia; Del Monte International in Panama;and Bandegua(Guatemala); the Philippine Packing Corp; Associated BiscuitsMalaysia; and R.J.Reynolds Tobacco in Malaysia. Their financial backers includedMetropolitan LifeInsurance of New York, Prudential, Aetma, North West Mutual,ManufacturersHanover Trust, Bankers Trust (a backer of Kindercare), and statepension funds inOregon, Washington, Utah, Minnesota, Michigan, New York,Wisconsin, Illinois,Iowa, Massachusetts, and Montana.\" I ask again. Why would acompany like thiswant to run a pre-school operation? Put all this informationtogether and there's astench that defies fumigation.310Children of the MatrixHere's George againJohn W. DeCamp, a former state senator for Nebraska, wrote a book calledTheFranklin Cover Up: Child Abuse, Satanism, And Murder In Nebraska (AWRInc.,Lincoln, Nebraska, 1992). In this, he details his knowledge of child abuseinvolvingvery famous names, including George Bush (father George). He wasinvestigating amassive savings and loans fraud at the Franklin Credit Unioninvolving aprominent republican called Laurence King, who sang the nationalanthem at theRepublican Conventions of 1984 and 88. During these investigations,DeCampdiscovered that King was also running a paedophile ring in Omaha,Nebraska,involving the chief of police, the owner of the local newspaper, andmany otherprominent people. In a video interview made in 1997, and now availablethroughHidden Mysteries at the David Icke website, he tells of a court case inwhich ayoung man was warned that if he told the truth about his abusers he wouldgo toprison for 20 years. They had already done this with a young woman whowasabused by the same prominent people. The man chose, hardly surprisingly, tokeepquiet. DeCamp describes what happened when he approached the judge:\"[I said] 'you know, I am so depressed. I love our system so much. I just...'The judgewas well...he just kept saying over and over, 'I'm just a man, I'm nota god. I'm just aman, I'm not a god. I can only do with the things I’m given,the evidence.’\"He was right, I suppose. I said, 'Everybody knows the truth. Everybody knowsthetruth. Every official, every judge, including you.' He said 'yeah' ...then hesaidsomething else. He said 'I can't change it but I can help you understand it.If youwant to understand Franklin, if you want to understand the Franklincover-up, youwant to understand what really happened, go read Billy Budd. If youwant tounderstand what happened in Franklin - you won't agree, you won't like it- go readBilly Budd.'\"I said, 'Who the blazes is Billy Budd?'\"He said 'Just go read it, you'll understand.'\"8DeCamp said the story of Billy Budd did help him to understand why a youngabusedwoman went to prison; why 20 people he identified in his books werekilled; andwhy things are as they are in Washington DC. Billy Budd was written byHermanMelville, the author of Moby Dick, and it is set in the \"great\" days oftheBritish Navy when \"Britannia\" ruled the waves. Billy Budd is a teenage boywhofinds himself in a squabble with a tough guy superior on a British ship.Thesuperior dies in an accident, but Billy Budd is charged with his murder andfaces acourt martial. A series of witnesses testify that Billy is innocent andthat the deadsuperior was probably one of the most vile people on Earth. Butdespite thisevidence, the officers on the court martial decide that they can'tfind him innocentbecause it would break down the system of absolute control theybelieved wasSuffer little children 311necessary to prevent a mutiny. And there you have it. Innocent people go tojail,guilty people go free, and untold numbers of abused children go unheard tokeepthe system of control in place by protecting the famous political, economic,media,and military names, who abuse, torture, and sacrifice children. They knowthat ifthe truth came out the people would mutiny. I've got news for them...thetruth iscoming out.The experience of Zack has been suffered by millions of other children alloverthe world and it continues today. The trauma compartmentalises the minds ofmostthem so they can't remember until much later in life or even not at all.Most of therest are so terrified by the consequences of speaking about theirexperiences thatthey stay silent. That's why Zack is such a brave little boy.Those that do tell theirstory are faced with a system structured to suppresspublic exposure. The next timepeople want to close their minds to a child's\"fantastic story\" of ritual abuse, theyshould remember that.SOURCES1 Sunday Mirror, October 24. 19992 Ibid3 Quoted by Andrew Boyd in Blasphemous Rumours (Fount Paperbacks, an imprintofHarperCollins.

There areindicationsthat the ritual of the Eucharist is a reflection of earlier ritualsrelated to humansacrifice and blood drinking. There is the emphasis onsymbolically eating the bodyof \"Jesus\" and drinking his blood as red wine. Wemight expect, therefore, that theChristian Church would be a front for Satanismand its blood and sacrifice rituals.That, it turns out, is precisely what it is.Today the religions of the world remain a major tool of the Illuminati agenda.Theymaintain the climate of unquestioning, unthinking, ignorance, and theirpseudo-morality provides a veil of hypocrisy, behind which the most sickeningabuse ofchildren can be hidden. Some of the most famous church \"leaders\" andevangelists onthe planet are Illuminati operatives who use religion tomanipulate and brain-washtheir followers while engaging in Satanic rituals thatbeggar belief. That is not to sayeveryone is involved in these horrors, ofcourse not. Most of the advocates of thesereligions would be as outraged as therest of us if they realised what was going on.But religions are alsocompartmentalised pyramids that allow the knowing tomanipulate the unknowing.Satanism and child abuse are an epidemic withinreligious institutions, and thewave of child abuse cases in the Roman CatholicChurch and others are a tiny,tiny fraction of what is really happening. What betterway to hide your Satanicrituals and networks than within a \"Christian\" church thatcondemns the work of\"Satan\"? What better way to hide your child sexual abuse thanwithin a\"Christian\" church that worships \"gentle Jesus\"? And, with so manychurches builton ancient pagan religious sites (energy vortexes and ley lines), theSatanistsdesire access to those \"Christian\" buildings for their rituals. This they candoif they control the church. Dr Loreda Fox is a Christian psychiatrist who hasworkedwith many victims of Satanism and trauma-based mind control orMultiplePersonality Disorder. She wrote in the Spiritual And Clinical DimensionsOf MultiplePersonality Disorder (Books of Sangre de Crista, Salida, Colorado,1992):312313\"Some Satanists have invaded the church as it is the perfect cover for them.Theymasquerade as angels of light and gravitate towards positions of leadershipin orderto have more influence. Because much of what they say is sounddoctrinaily, they arerarely detected. Most survivors whom I have worked with hadSatanist parents whowere in high positions in churches; many were pastors.\"1Billy Graham, the mind-controlled satanistNote that she did not say some or even many of those Satanic parents were inhighpositions in the churches. She said most. The Illuminati deploys its agents,all ofthem under mind control of some variety, to lead their religious believersinto theclutches of the Anunnaki agenda or \"New World Order\". One such man isthemost famous evangelist in the world, the American Billy Graham, who is a33rddegree Freemason and a practising Satanist. He joined the Freemasons sometimearound 1948. Graham is a friend of the shape-shifter, paedophile, and serialkiller,George Bush, and they famously \"prayed\" together, according to Bush, thenighthe ordered the genocide in Iraq in 1991. That same year, Billy Graham saidon hisUS radio show, Embrace America 2000, that the American people shouldsupportBush's New World Order. Graham has also said that he thought UFOs couldbe theangels of God. Graham is close to Henry Kissinger, one of the mostactivemanipulators for the Illuminati at operational level. Another friend wasAllanDulles, the Satanist Director of the CIA. Dulles helped to fund AdolfHitler andfounded the Illuminati's World Council of Churches. Dulles was also,significantly,one of the main architects of the infamous MKUltra mind controlproject. Agents ofthe Illuminati, like Graham, are all subjected to MultiplePersonality Disorderprogramming. Through this, they are given coverpersonalities within a mindfractured into different compartments. The frontcompartment or \"altar\", the onethat normally interacts with the daily world, maybe of a church leader, a toppolitician, a doctor, and generally people who wouldnever be suspected of beinginvolved with the Illuminati's Satanic ritualnetwork. \"Oh, he'd never do that\" isthe response they are looking for if thetruth ever threatens to come out. Theseprogrammes can give someone like BillyGraham a word-perfect grasp of Biblicaldoctrine, while his \"back altars\" orpersonalities take part in Satanic sacrifice ritual.This is why we should notview many of these people harshly. They, too, arevictims of theother-dimensional entities, which inhabit their bodies and controltheir minds.David Berkowitz, the serial killer in New York known as the Son ofSam, said hewas part of a Satanic group that had orchestrated the murders. Inletters to achurch minister, he revealed the kind of people involved in ritualhumansacrifice:\"...Satanists (genuine ones) are peculiar people. They aren't ignorantpeasantsor semi-literate natives. Rather, their ranks are filled with doctors,lawyers,businessmen, and basically highly responsible citizens...they are not acarelessgroup who are apt to make mistakes. But they are secretive and bondedtogether by314Children of the Matrixa common need and desire to mete out havoc on society. It was Aleister Crowleywhosaid: 'I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything bad1.\"2So there is nothing contradictory about Billy Graham being a Satanist andtheworld's most famous evangelist. Researcher Alan Walton writes: \"Thesereptilianhybrids often lead a double life involving dual personalities, onewhich leads a\"normal\" life in the outer world, and one that is deeply involvedwith theunderground alien society on a nocturnal basis.\"3 He says this isespecially true ofwhat he calls \"cocooned/hosted\" individuals and\"hybrids/abductees\". Graham'sbloodline goes back to Jakob Frank, the leader of a\"Hebrew\" Satanic cult calledSabbatianism and this later became known asFrankism. The Rothschilds wereinvolved with Frankism (see ...And The Truth ShallSet You Free). Jakob Frank taughthis followers to \"convert\" to another religionand to use that front to hide theirSatanism. When Graham's ancestors first cameover to America, they were from theFrank family. The American researcher FritzSpringmeier, himself a Christian,exposed Graham as a Satanist in his book BeWise As Serpents in 1991. He expandedon this theme with the recovering mindcontrol victim Cisco Wheeler in their bookThe Illuminati Formula To Create AnUndetectable Total Mind Control led Slave(Springmeier, SE Clackamas Road,Clackamas, Oregon, 97015,1996).4 Their sourcesincluded eyewitnesses and thosewho claim to have been abused by Graham.Among other sources was a member of theIlluminati's Council on Foreign Relationswho is secretly against the New WorldOrder; an operative with the US NationalSecurity Agency, who opposes theIlluminati; a high-level CIA administrator;Satanists and ex Satanists; a former33rd degree Freemason; and various people whohave worked with Billy Graham. Ononly two occasions, Springmeier and Wheelersay, were any of these people awareof what the others had told them. Phillip Eugenede Rothschild, who claims tohave been conceived and brought up by Baron Philippede Rothschild in France,says that he was given a front-altar personality as a piousChristian, whichcovered his Satanic programming. He was programmed(\"dissociated\") to infiltratethe Christian Church for the Rothschilds and theIlluminati network. In anInternet account of his life, he says:\"Like the hundreds of thousands of this occult family's other biologicalchildren, I hadmy place and function within this clan's attempt to control theworld. My efforts andmy family's efforts strove to have a member of the Europeannobility of the Habsburgfamily assume the pre-eminent position over humanity, aposition called the Antichristby Christianity. While others were seeded intogovernment, academia, business, orentertainment, my place was within the Body ofChrist. I was to be a focus forspiritual power and controller of a cult withinthis Church. In this Church have livedpeople who I have known all my life to bethe controllers and power centers of boththe Rothschild family's false prophetand the antichrist.\"Many dissociated Christians in the Body of Christ hold similar corporatespiritual,occult positions as part of the Satanic new world order. In my being Iembodied the315Luciferian morning star within the Church. I represented the presence of alltheother Satanists who were related to me in the morning star; their spiritswerepresent in me in the Church. Constructed through ritual but empowered bylegionsof [demonic] spirits, I was a human and spiritual focus of corporateSatanic energyinto the Body of Christ...\" ...For the Rothschilds, and for Satan himself I am sure, this was theultimatesadistic irony in using Christians to bring in the antichrist, but thereis a certaindemonic brilliance to it. By seeding the Body of Christ with hisoccult followers, Satanhas been able to generate the spiritual and sociologicalforces that are required tobring in the false prophets and the antichrist'sreign.\"5Billy Graham is another such programmed front for Satanism in the\"ChristianChurch\". The trail to Graham was picked up in stages during generalresearch intothe Illuminati and you only have to look at the people behind himto realise that heis a pawn of the bloodlines. The newspaper tycoon WilliamRandolph Hearst, ahigh-degree Illuminati initiate, funded his early \"crusades\".The Hearst mansion inCalifornia is furnished with hundreds of ancient Egyptianand other Near andMiddle Eastern artefacts. Most of them are original and wereshipped to the UnitedStates by Hearst at enormous expense. It was Hearst'ssupport for Franklin DelanoRoosevelt that won \"FDR\" the Democratic nominationand the presidency in 1933.Roosevelt, the wartime president, was one of thegreat Illuminati frontmen of the20th century (see ...And The Truth Shall Set YouFree). The Rockefellers, Witneys, andVanderbilts, all Illuminati bloodlinefamilies, have funded other Graham\"crusades\". Ever wondered why Billy Graham hashad such a close association withso many US presidents? According to theresearch of Springmeier and Wheeler, ahigh-ranking Scottish Rite Freemason andMafia operative called David Hill livedfor two years at Billy Graham's house. Hewas a friend of Graham's son, Franklin,they say. David Hill claims to haveintroduced Graham to the Mafia boss joeBanana. Hill apparently turned againsthis former bosses and spent 18 hours overtwo days in a hotel room warning Grahamabout the Illuminati agenda.Springmeier and Wheeler report: \"Billy Graham toldDavid Hill at the end of theirtwo days of talking in this eastern US hotel roomthat he was 'a captive of that[New World Order]'.” They add: \"Billy Graham hasthe choice of continuing his jobfor them, or being destroyed. Since they createdwho he is, they can destroy him.And he knows it.\"6 David Hill was murdered whenhe had completed a manuscriptexposing the Illuminati plans, they say. In March2001, Springmeier and his wifePatricia were raided by the FBI and the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,the agencies involved in the mass murder at Waco.Springmeier's research wastaken together with money and other items. Abreathtakingly biased and distortednews story followed. Usual technique.Springmeier and Wheeler say that when Graham's crusade went to Portland,Oregon,where they live, his staff was able to contact many recovering victimsoftrauma-based mind control and Satanic ritual abuse. How could they do that?316Children of the MatrixThey were invited to a meeting with Graham. At this meeting, some of thevictimssay, Graham used a series of classic trigger words and phrases tore-establish theirprogramming. Graham has surrounded himself with Freemasons,includingWilliam M. Watson, the Director of Graham's Evangelistic Associationand achairman of the Illuminati's Occidental Petroleum Corporation; and DavidM.McConnel, another director of Graham's \"Association\", and US ambassador totheUnited Nations (1968-69). The latter is an important Illuminati post alsoheld bythe Illuminati's George Bush and Madeleine Albright. Graham has supportedthe\"ministries\" of Robert Schuller, Norman Vincent Peale, and Oral Roberts, all33rddegree Freemasons, according to Springmeier and Wheeler. Phillip EugenedeRothschild told me the following about Oral Roberts and his son RichardRobertsfrom his own direct experience in the Satanic network of the Illuminati:\"Oral Roberts succeeded in hijacking contemporary American Christianitytoworship a different Jesus under the power of a different holy spirit. Oral hasbeen(and still most probably is, despite his retirement) an occult priest of theoldSumero-Akkadian mystery religion. Satanism in its most pristine form. MrRobertswas my occult spiritual mentor and indoctrinator. He has been the closestoffriends to my Rothschild family and to Prince Philip... Mr Richard Roberts isacorrupt tele-evangelist from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Richard is now activelyenlargingthe occult spiritual legacy of his father. Mr Roberts is an occultsorcerer parexcellence who is empowering the apostasy of contemporary AmericanandWestern Christianity.\"7The evangelists Robert Schuller and Norman Vincent Peale offer a similarstory.Schuller, like Graham, is sexually served by women from the Illuminatimindcontrol programmes. Peale, a good friend of Graham, is a 6th-degreeIlluminatithrough the Pilgrim Society, another strand in the web. By far thelargest numberof \"new converts\" from Graham's New York Crusade have been handedto Peale'schurch. Oral Roberts has been seen by Springmeier and Wheeler sourcestakingpart in Satanism and mind control. The Charismatic Movement is anIlluminaticreation. Graham helped to launch the Oral Roberts University inTulsa,Oklahoma. The Southern Baptists, of whom Graham is a member, areIlluminaticontrolled, through the Freemasons. Jesse Jackson, another Illuminati\"preacher\"and friend of Graham, is a Prince Hall Freemason, the order for blackpeople.What a monumental fraud this guy Jackson is, but then he's not alone. The33rddegree of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is an honorary degree and canonly beattained at the behest of those who control the 33rd degree from itssupremeheadquarters in the serpent-decorated temple in Washington. Jim Shaw, whowasinitiated there, said in The Deadly Deception that he saw some very famousfacesat the ceremony:\"There were some extremely prominent men there that day. including aScandinavianking [King Gustav of Sweden is Illuminati and, of course,bloodline], two former317presidents of the United States, an internationally prominent evangelist, twootherinternationally prominent clergymen, and a very high official of thefederalgovernment, the one who actually presented me with the certificate of the33rddegree.\"8 (My emphasis).They hail from YaleAnother famous Illuminati face within the \"Christian\" movement is PatRobertson,the American television evangelist and close friend of the Bushfamily. Robertson isyet another product of Yale University, the home of theinfamous Skull and BonesSociety. Bill and Hillary Clinton graduated from Yale in1973, Gerald Ford, a YaleLaw School graduate, became President of the UnitedStates in 1974 after theWatergate scandal removed Nixon, and George Bush seniorand junior are both Yalemen who were initiated into the Skull and Bones Society.Interestingly, according toa History Channel documentary in February 2001, sonBush's Skull and Bonesname was \"Temporary\"! In its window less mausoleum acrossthe road from theYale campus, the Skull and Bones initiates take part in theirblood rituals. Theseinvolve drinking from a human skull (see ...And The TruthShall Set You Free andTheBiggest Secret). Jim Shaw reveals that the initiation into the 33rd degree oftheScottish Rite of Freemasonry includes drinking wine from a human skull.TheKnights Templar, out of which Freemasonry sprang to a large extent, wereaccusedat the time of the purge in 1307 of using skulls in their rituals, andindeed they usedto fly the skull and bones flag on their ships. Pat Robertson'sfather, Senator A.WillisRobertson, helped to block the Congressionalinvestigation into the banking andcurrency practices of thejjluminati's FederalReserve Bank. Pat Robertson wrote inhis book, The Nezv World Order, that hisfather was Chairman of the House Bankingand Currency Committee, and went on tochair its equivalent in the Senate. He saidhis father had:\"...the hearty support of the banking committee [and] as I write this I amlooking at alovely sterling silver tray given him by the American BankersAssociation at theirannual meeting in San Francisco, October 25th, 1966. Myfather was also acolleague in the Senate of Prescott Bush, the father of GeorgeBush.\"9Robertson boasts in the book about his \"distinguished heritage that goesbackfrom colonial days to the nobility of England\". Oh, I am surprised. Hisfather'sbuddy, Prescott Bush (Yale, Skull and Bones), was one of the funders ofAdolfHitler via the Harriman Empire. A Harriman company, the UnitedBankingCorporation (UBC) interfaced with the steel and banking network of FritzThyssen,who was acknowledged at the Nuremberg Trials as a major financialsupporter ofthe Nazi war machine. It was through the UBC, headed by PrescottBush, that vastsums were channelled from the American Illuminati bloodlines tofund Hitler'smilitary expansion (see ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free). Nowonder Robertsonlent his support for the \"election\" of President George W. Bush,or \"Shrub\" in 2000.318Children of the MatrixRobertson claims to be a born-againevangelical Christian. He founded theChristian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in1961 and is the host of its stunningly tediousFigure 39: The logo of PatRobertson's daily talk show, The 700 Club. The ChristianChristian Broadcasting Network D , .■ NT . , , , e ,■Broadcasting Network has received fundingPicture #77 [images/img_0077.png]Picture #78 [images/img_0078.png]from Illuminati families and has their classiclighted torch symbol as its logo(Figure 39).The other major US Christian channel, theTrinity BroadcastingNetwork (TBN), has alion and a white horse on its logo - bothancient symbols forthe Sun - and the dovesymbolic of the Illuminati goddess (Figure40). If you arein America give TBN a watch.It is an experience you will never forget, norwillyour eyes believe what they are seeing.Robertson was a candidate fortheRepublican presidential nomination in 1988Figure 40: The lion, white horse, and dove, ofthe Trinity Broadcasting Networkand a year later founded the ChristianCoalition political pressure group. Hewasborn in Lexington, Virginia in 1930, studiedat the New York Theological Seminary, and was ordained into the Illuminati-controlled Southern Baptist Church in 1961. A 'Bible conservative', he says hebelieves in 'traditional values'. In 1981 he started the Freedom Council torecruitevangelical Christians for political action. He supported the then PresidentGeorgeBush in his re-election race in 1992 and Robertson's \"Christian Coalition\"or \"TheReligious Right\" were massively involved in the Bush camp. Confidentialdocumentsobtained by CNN showed that Robertson hand-picked more than 30Bush campaignleaders, and the Bush campaign had advance information on theprinting anddistribution of 40 million Christian Coalition voter guides favourableto Bush.In turn, he raised money for the Christian Coalition.10 How ironic this iswhenyou consider that George Bush is a paedophile, child killer, drug runner,massmurderer, and Satanist. How does that square with the alleged \"Christian\"beliefsof Robertson and his gang? But then there is far more to the \"ReligiousRight\"than religion. If, indeed, at its top level, there is any religion at allthatwould pass for Christianity. It's all a scam and I urge Christians toinvestigate whodictates their religion, just as I urge Jewish people to look athow they aremanipulated mercilessly by their self-appointed leaders at B'naiB'rith, the Anti-Defamation League, the British Board of Jewish Deputies, andBronfman-frontslike the Canadian Jewish Congress and the World Jewish Congress.Theseorganisations that control the \"Christian\" and \"Judaic\" con men arethemselvescontrolled by the same force.As 1 was completing this book, George W. Bush nominated Senator JohnAshcroft tobe his top law officer as Attorney General. Ashcroft is another member319of the Religious Right who appears to have emerged from the same do-what-Isay-not-what-I-do-mould that spawned Pat Robertson. He describes himself asaChristian conservative who doesn't smoke, drink, or dance. He is againstabortionbecause it takes a human life created by God and yet supports the deathpenalty. Gowork that one out. Ashcroft's big claim to fame is his war on drugsand addictivesubstances and he demands the death penalty for some such offences.At the sametime he has taken $44,500 dollars from beer companies since 1993,including $20,000from St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch. He has also been lauded bythe boozeindustry in a video tribute produced by the Beer Institute of America.When MotherJones magazine questioned this contradiction, Ashcroft said: \"It's aproduct that isin demand. And when it's used responsibly, it's like otherproducts.\" Oh, right, andthe fact that it makes you money makes no difference,of course. Ashcroft alsoaccepted money from the tobacco industry for his 1994Senate race and said oftobacco that people should be free to make bad choices.Unless Ashcroft decidesotherwise, that is. He is another Robertson-type clonewho will typify the Bushadministration - a far-right hypocrite with a selective\"morality\" that changes bythe sentence to meet the needs of the moment.Support the poor and needy...er, Pat RobertsonPat Robertson, this man of Christian compassion, uses the viewers of histelevisionstation to support his business interests or rather \"the poor andneedy\". Heoperates a massive media and business empire and it mixes very nicelythank youwith his Christian \"Ministry\". One of his notorious businessarrangements was inthe Congo, formerly Zaire, which is now being ravaged yetagain by an Illuminatiwar. Robertson's business there involved his friend, thevicious and criminaldictator, the late Mobuto Sese Seko. Mobuto raped hiscountry's finances andplaced billions of dollars in sequestered accounts inSwitzerland and elsewhere. Itwas said that Mobuto could have solved Zaire'sfinancial nightmare just by writinga personal cheque. Robertson tried to sellMobuto as a bastion of Christian anti-communism who was maintaining the lineagainst Marxist guerrillas in Africa insupport of US interests. The two wereclose friends and on one occasion Mobutowined and dined Robertson on hispersonal yacht during a business trip. Robertsonset up the African DevelopmentCompany to mine diamonds and this was alsogiven lumber concessions by the ZaireGovernment - by Mobutu in other words.This is where Robertson's 700 Club,operated by his Christian BroadcastingNetwork, came in so handy. The members andother viewers were told that theywere contributing money to \"Operation Blessing\"to help the needy in Africa. Theneedy, it seems, being better known as PatRobertson, if what employees of thisoperation say is correct. Pilots forOperation Blessing told reporters that apart froma limited number of flights totransport medical supplies, most of their time in theair was spent ferryingmining equipment and other materials required forRobertson's African DevelopmentCompany. One airman, Robert Hinkle, told theVirginia-Pilot newspaper:320Children of the Matrix\"We got over there and we had 'Operation Blessing' painted on the tails oftheairplanes but we were doing no humanitarian relief at all. We were justsupplying theminers and flying the dredges from Kinshasa out to Tshikapa [theoperations base forthe African Development Company],\"We hauled medical supplies one time,\" added Hinkle. \"It might have been500pounds at the most...\"11State officials in Virginia have refused to comment on the findings ofaninvestigation into Robertson's charity and his diamond mine venture. TheVirginiaOffice of Consumer Affairs has been \"investigating\" allegations ofimproprietysince June 1997 when a state senator first raised the issue of taxexemptions forRobertson, and possible consumer fraud. According to theVirginia-Pilot newspaperedition of October 1, 1998, State Attorney General MarkEarley refused to discloseany information or findings. Robertson contributed$35,000 to Earley's electioncampaign - the largest donation from a singleindividual. Would you take morallectures from Pat Robertson? Would you buy aused Bible from him? No, nor even anew one. But millions do. Robertson has sincecondemned Mobutu in an attempt todistance himself from the scandal.Many people don't realise that the Family television channel was created byPatRobertson's International Family Entertainment (IFE). Robertson wanted, hesaid, afamily values channel, which did not pander to the lower moral instinctsof sex andviolence. He then sold the Family Channel along with IFE to...RupertMurdoch'sNews Corporation for nearly $1.7 billion! It made multi-millions forRobertson. HisChristian Broadcasting Network held 3.8 million shares ofInternational FamilyEntertainment (IFE). Robertson said that $136.1 million fromthe stock sale wouldbe used to fund a global evangelism programme. CBN will alsoget an additional$109.3 million from a trust set up by Robertson using IFEstock. That money willbecome available in 2010. In addition, Robertson's RegentUniversity sold its 4.2million shares of IFE stock for $147 million. Robertsonsaid the money would gointo his school's endowment fund.12 These are just a fewof the headlines exposingthe background of the man who seeks to tell Americanshow to live their lives andwho should govern them. The leader of the moralmajority? Bullshit. Christianityand religion in general were created to deceiveat their very foundation and theyhave been used for deception ever since. Theguys who reach the top are those whoknow that the whole basis of the \"faith\" isnonsense. To them it is a money gameand a means to support the agenda of theirIlluminati masters.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day HybridsWherever you look at the top of these religions you find either con men orSatanists,often both, and those who are simply too manipulated to see what isgoing onaround them. The religious con men have a simple philosophy: I'll saywhat I needto say and be what I need to be to get what I want. In my experienceso far, the mostobvious Satanic church is that of the Mormons, or the Church ofJesus Christ of321Latter Day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Cathy O'Brien inTrance-FormationOf America says the Mormon operation in Salt Lake City is amajor centre forIlluminati trauma-based mind control. The Mormons were anIlluminati creation,as I mentioned earlier, and its founders were all high-levelFreemasons andMerovingian bloodline. The Rothschilds supplied their funding.Joseph Smithfounded the Mormons after an \"angel\" called Moroni appeared to himin 1823, as 1outlined earlier. The Book of Mormon claims to be an account of howthe \"losttribes of Israel\" came to America. But there were no \"lost tribes\", asthe Samaritanpeople confirmed. Joseph Smith also claims in his fairy tale thatJesus visitedAmerica to see the civilisation his chosen people had created.Smith became anEntered Apprentice Freemason on March 15th, 1842, and the nextday was made aMaster Mason. According to Freemasonic rules there should be atleast a 30-daygap, but the Grand Master of the Illinois Lodge, Abraham Jonas,waived this. In hiswork, History Of The Church, Joseph Smith confirms he was aFreemason and notesthat on March 15th 1842: \"...I received the first degree inFree Masonry in theNauvoo Lodge, assembled in my general business office.” Thenext day he records\"I was with the Masonic Lodge and rose to the sublimedegree\"(Master Mason).Dr Reed Durham, a president of the Mormon HistoryAssociation, said:\"There is absolutely no question in my mind that the Mormon ceremony whichcameto be known as the Endowment, introduced by Joseph Smith to Mormon Masons,hadan immediate inspiration from Masonry. It is also obvious that the NauvooTemplearchitecture was in part, at least, masonically influenced. Indeed, itappears thatthere was an intentional attempt to utilize Masonic symbols andmotifs...\"13If anyone is in any doubt that Mormonism is Freemasonry under another name,theyshould compare the Masonic oaths with those of the Mormons. Here is justoneexample: In the Mormon ceremony it says: \"We and each of us do covenantandpromise that we will not reveal the secrets of this, the Second Token of theAaronicPriesthood, with its accompanying name, sign, grip, or penalty. Should wedo so,we agree to have our breasts cut open and our hearts and vitals torn fromourbodies and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.\" TheMasonicritual says: \"I ...most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear...that Iwill notgive the degree of a Fellow Craft Mason to anyone of an inferior degree,nor to anyother being in the known world...binding myself under no less penaltythan tohave my left breast torn open and my heart and vitals taken fromthence...tobecome a prey to the wild beasts of the field, and vulture of theair...\". JosephSmith's \"Mormon\" Endowment Ceremony was simply rituals fromFreemasonry'sBlue Lodge Degrees. Even their underwear is the same. On Mormonunderwear acarpenter's square covers the right breast and over the left is aFreemasoniccompass. There is an opening at the navel to symbolise thedisembowelling penaltyfor disclosing Mormon secrets. They are told that theirunderwear will be their\"shield and protection\", especially the Masonic symbols,and they can only usetheir worn-out underwear for other purposes if they cut orburn out the areas322Children of the Matrixdepicting the Masonic square and compass. These instructions are straightfromoccult or ritual magic. Jim Shaw, the former 33rd degree Freemason,describes yetanother Freemasonic connection to the Mormons:\"A recommendation for acceptance is called a 'recommend' in the Lodge, as isthecase with Mormons seeking admission to the secret rituals of the MormonTemple.Much of the Mormon Temple ritual is the same as the Masonic Ritual,having beenborrowed from it by Smith.\"14The Mormon buildings are adorned with Illuminati symbols. The invertedpentagram,the most obvious of Satanic symbols, can be found on the Temple atSalt LakeCity, on the Mormon museum nearby, and on other Mormon properties.The pentagramis used in rituals to summon demons in Satanism and, in itsinverted form, is said to be the sign of \"Satan\", the Goat of Mendes, orBaphoment.This is the deity some of the Knights Templar were accused ofworshipping whenthey were purged in France in 1307. Wherever you find an Illuminati Satanicoperation, the symbols of the Sun and Moon will be prominently displayed.TheMormon Nauvoo temple included 30 2.5-ton stones depicting the radiant Sun and30 moonstones before the building was destroyed. Smith said theSunstonesymbolised the Mormon's \"Celestial Kingdom\" - another steal fromFreemasonry.Sunstones, Moonstones, Saturn stones, star stones. Earth stones, anda depiction ofUrsa Major, are all to be found on the Salt Lake Temple. So, too,is the Illuminati'sall-seeing eye, one of their most obvious symbols. TheMormons use the symbol ofthe beehive, a symbol of the Merovingian bloodline.This is hardly surprising withthe two Smiths and Brigham Young from that geneticstream. The beehive isfurther symbolic of the ancient Goddess Artemis, alsoknown as Diana. The SaltLake Temple is built with granite, a rock that has beenused throughout the agesfor temples on Earth power centres and for esotericinitiation. When I spoke in SaltLake City, near the Temple, I came across thefascinating book by William J.Schnoebelen called Mormonism's Temple Of Doom(Triple J Pub., Idaho Falls: 1987).Schnoebelen was initiated into the Wiccapagan religion, then into Freemasonry,before going through the Mormon initiationin the Salt Lake Temple. He shows ingreat detail that all three initiations werethe same. They have the same oaths,secret handshakes, and garb. We are looking at one face hidden by many masks.Joseph Smith even used the Freemason's code for distress in his dying words.When a Freemason is in trouble he says: \"O Lord, my God! Is there no help forthewidow's son?\" Smith's dying words included: \"Oh Lord, my God, is there nohelpfor the widow's son!\" He also gave the Freemasonic sign of distress. JosephSmithcarried a dove medallion given to him by an English Masonic lodge and thedoveis Illuminati symbolism for Queen Semiramis (El), the female deity intheirBabylonian trinity and for the Dragon queens. Today the Mormons, asanimportant branch of the Illuminati, have a strong influence in Washington.Congressman Orrin Hatch, an elder (El-der) of the Mormon Church, is one oftheirrepresentatives, but there are many others.The rank-and-file Mormons who knock on your door or stop you in the streetwiththeir scrubbed faces and their smart clothes have no idea about any of this.When1 visited Salt Lake City in 1999. two lovely Mormon girls gave me a tour ofthetemple site. One was from Thailand, the other from Hong Kong. They hadbeenworking day and night back home to earn the money to pay for their flighttoAmerica and all their expenses for the \"privilege\" of serving the church inthis way.They told me what the hierarchy told them to tell all the visitors, andthey repeatedtheir script without question. 1 told them a few facts about the\"Jesus\" story andthey said they had no idea this information existed. I askedthem if there was anysignificance in the fact that the founders of the MormonChurch were Freemasons.They looked at each other in bewilderment and eventuallyone said \"What areFreemasons?\" This is the way the few control the many. Thenthere is the strangestory of the toad, which Smith said appeared when he went tofind the plates onwhich the Mormon religion was founded. Smith worked from timeto time for thefamily of Benjamin Saunders. In an interview in September 1884,which is still in theMormon library archives, Saunders says that Smith describedhow he saw a toad-like amphibian transform into a man. Saunders said:\"I heard Joe tell my mother and sister how he procured the plates. He said hewasdirected by an angel to where it was. He went in the night to get the plates.When hetook the plates there was something down near the box that lookedsomething like atoad that rose up into a man which forbid him to take theplates. ...He told his storyjust as earnestly as anyone could. He seemed tobelieve all he said.\"15In 1833, Willard Chase corroborated the story in an affidavit: \"He saw in theboxsomething like a toad, which soon assumed the appearance of a man, andstruckhim on the side of his head.\" Given the evidence available to expose theMormonChurch for what it really is, one may think that its followers must havealso beenstruck on the side of the head by a blow of some considerable power.But so manypeople find blind faith a source of such comfort that they willdefend their belief tothe death, even though they, themselves, are victims ofit. You can find more detailabout the real Mormon Church in the ReligiousArchives at www.davidicke.com,and elsewhere on the Internet. There is a Mormonexpose site run by two formerMormons, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, at www.utlm.org.Sandra Tanner is the great,great, granddaughter of Brigham Young.Mormon satanismSo the Mormon religion was founded by Freemasons, uses Freemasonic,Illuminati,and ancient rituals and symbols, and is big into blood atonement andterriblevengeance for revealing the secrets. It has all the signs of being afront for Satanismand so it is. I have received many testimonies from thevictims of Mormon Satanismand mind control and the following story is indicativeof all of them. It comes froma woman who was brought up in the Mormon faith inUtah. She told me that \"mostof the early faithful were from the Merovingianbloodline, which is Illuminati\" and324Children of the Matrixthat the abuse of children was handed down through the generations tocreaterobotic-slaves of trauma-based mind control. \"They helped each other byabusingeach others' children and traumatising them to split their minds,\" shesaid. It isinteresting how many \"faiths\" encourage, even demand, that peoplemarry withintheir \"church\". As researchers of trauma-based mind control haveestablished, theIlluminati are looking for families with a history of childabuse and trauma becauseeach new generation of these bloodlines becomes moreopen to mind control astheir DNA is reprogrammed by the experiences. To havefamily networks of abusedchildren is to have a breeding ground for those who aremore open to mind controlthan the rest of the population. If you ensure thatthese family networks are of theAnunnaki bloodline, you have hit the jackpot.You have people who are both veryopen to mind control and, through theirgenetics, it is easier for the fourth-dimension entities to \"possess\" theirbodies. The Mormon Church, of course, isobsessed with genetics and bloodlinesand its massive genealogical data hanks areused by the Illuminati to keeprecords of who has the reptilian bloodline and whodoes not. Researcher AlanWalton writes:\"My genealogical line intersects with the ancestry of the English royal family,andfrom what I understand many of the hybrid lines have ended up in theneo-Masoniclodge known as the Mormon/LDS church, which serves as a cover formany of the oldreptilian blood lines... possibly the reason why LDS prefer largefamilies, i.e. to'breed' out the normal human genetic lines to be replaced byreptilian/hybrid lines? Iam familiar with many, many Mormon cultured hybridabductees who are also MPD[Multiple Personality Disorder]. However I have alsofound that there is tremendouspressure placed on these people especially in Utah(one of the major undergroundnesting areas for both reptilians and hybrids) NOTto discuss their abductions, eventhough the Mormon church officially does teachin the existence of extraterrestrialcivilizations. There are, however, even morefull-blooded reptilian and hybrid bloodlines who reside permanently in theunderground society, and who are sold-outSatanic worshipping, blood-festing,shape shifters.\"16I will call my Mormon informant Jane, because, like most of the people whotelltheir stories, they are concerned for the consequences.17 This is especiallytrue whenthey have seen at close hand what these guys will do. She said thefirst Mormonritual she attended was in Bountiful, Utah, wearing the dress hermother had madefor her fourth birthday. A woman beat her with branches from atree and she wastold: \"See, Jesus doesn't love you and he is not going to saveyou.\" This is straightfrom the manual of trauma-based mind control. Jane saidthe beating was so intensethat she left her body and was watching herself beinghit. This often happens inthese circumstances and it is the mind \"dissociating\"(splitting, withdrawing anddistancing itself) from the trauma. People of certainbloodlines with family historiesof child abuse dissociate easily, and each timethey do so another compartment iscreated in their mind. The woman who beat herwas the one who welcomed thechildren at the Sunday school. When Jane saw her thenext Sunday, she did not325recognise her because the trauma had been compartmentalised. But she reactedbykicking and screaming, although she did not know why at the time. Sincehermemories have begun to return, as they have for many such victims, sherecalledvividly being placed in a cedar chest and the lid secured. She was leftin there untilshe lost consciousness and when she was revived she was told thatJesus didn't loveher and that Satan had come to save her. This happened severaltimes and wasdesigned, obviously, to turn her allegiance to Satanism. She alsohas memories ofnearly drowning many times. She says she was belittled, beaten,and starved. Herfather would eat in front of her and her brother while they wenthungry. Her motherwas treated the same. All this is classic mind controltechnique. When people go forlong periods without food and are mentally,emotionally, and physically exhausted,they are more open to suggestion. Afterworld wars, for example, the globalpopulation is most open to suggestion becausethey are mentally, emotionally, and,at least many, physically exhausted. WhenJane's family moved to Murray, Utah, herschool sent her to a social worker oncea week and he sexually abused her. She wastold she would be in big trouble ifshe revealed the secret. As we've seen, childrenare often told that they ortheir loved ones, including their animals, will beslaughtered if they ever tellanyone. They are also drugged and made to performsacrifices on other children.This is videoed and played back to them in a non-drugged state. They are toldthat if they don't do as they are told the police will beshown the video andthey will be locked in prison. Jane remembers at least twooccasions when herparents held her down and gave her a shot of something from asyringe, and thesexual abuse of her and her brother was incessant:\"I was sodomized so badly during those years that I developed fissures in myrectum three different times. It never occurred to me to tell my mother becausetheprogramming to keep the secret was so in place. ...I just suffered in silence. Ialsoremember this man using my mother for sex and she has no memory of it at all.\"18She says she was taken to the most secret Mormon rites at the Salt Lake Templeatthe age of 20. Instead of entering the temple through the front door, shewastaken through a tunnel under the street. 1 was sent some material just aftermy visitto Salt Lake City, which was claimed to come from a military source. Itdescribedhow the Mormon temple is on top of a reptilian underground base thatcould beaccessed from the temple itself. Many ancient pyramids, temples, mounds,andother earthworks also had entrances to underground reptilian cities. Jane wastakenthrough a tunnel to a place called the Pink Room. There she saw several oftheMormon leaders dressed in black worshipping Lucifer in a ritual called TrueOrderof Prayer. This is a ritual form of the ceremony the regular Mormons gothroughwith all the signs, tokens, and penalties. She said she saw one Mormonleader, aPresident Benson, tied to a chair and gagged when he refused to watchthe sacrifice.When he still refused to participate, she says he was put in awhite bag, like alaundry bag, and they all beat him. Jane also experienced theunexplainabledisappearance of foetuses she was carrying:326Children of the Matrix\"I would be fine and three or five months pregnant with not a sign ofanythingwrong and then I would not be able to feel my baby by feeling my abdomenor feelit move and I would not be pregnant. One time I was very far-gone, but Idon'tknow how far, maybe seven months, and the baby disappeared and I waskeptdrugged for six weeks. When I came out of being drugged I felt my stomachandthere was no baby.\"A couple of years ago I remembered delivering that baby in a room...I wasattendedby two men that I don't know and one said he was the father of the baby.After hewas born, they held him up for me to see and I never saw him again andhave neverknown what happened to him. I also remember having four babies removedfrom mybody and them being sacrificed while I was tied to a cross shaped stonealter.Everyone had on black robes and hoods and we were underground in a caveorsomething. I also remember seeing two monsters fighting furiously drippingblood andfighting about what they were eating. They were reptilian and lookedsomething likethe dinosaurs that a teacher at school used to show us. I don'tknow what they wereeating. I keep thinking that my mind wants to heal and I haveto face that they ate mybaby, but for now I can’t handle it so I think of it asjust a nightmare. I can’t get thefuriousness of them eating out of my mind. Itis so horrific.\"19I'm afraid that eating the baby is exactly what they were doing. The scenethatJane describes under the Salt Lake City Temple is the same as that describedbyArizona Wilder at the rituals conducted for the British royal family at placeslikeBalmoral Castle. When we read all those ancient stories of sacrifices to the\"gods\",including the thousands sacrificed by the Aztecs of Central Americaalone, we arelooking at literal sacrifices to literal \"gods\". Jane said: \"Theblood that they crave islike a homeopathic formula for our feelings and thoughtsto be transmitted tothem.\" She said that she would see the greys and tall beingswith black robes. Herchildren and daughter in law would also see them, she said.\"[What] was so weirdis that we could feel them around, but not always see them.They seemed to delightin showing themselves to me separately when I was alone.\"Her daughter-in-lawbecame pregnant with twins who disappeared before birth andshe became analcoholic, and committed suicide because of her experiences. Janebecame pregnantagain and, in May 1992, shortly after hearing strange, butfamiliar, \"whooshing\"noises in the house, she started to haemorrhage. She wasrushed to hospital whereonly the placenta was found:\"The baby had gone and the cord was sheared off like somebody cut off a pieceofliver, but that part had not bled, only where the placenta was tearing awayfrom theuterus. The sac was entirely missing also. I was very upset and knewwhat hadhappened, but of course could not discuss it with the medical personnel.I now thinkthat the first noises that I heard were beings coming to harvest thebaby, but I wasnot asleep or controlled by the sound in the usual way. They musthave gotten it laterbecause when the placenta came out the baby had beenextracted earlier.\"20327In October 1992, the month her husband died of cancer, she says she was lyingonher bed with only a robe on when a light came through the window and burnedahole in her abdomen about the size of a pencil all the way into the organs. \"Itwasprobably the height of the uterus but to the right side a little bit.\" Thiscaused aserious infection, she said, and she has since had huge burns on herabdomen. Sherecalls that the doctor asked how she got the burn and she couldonly tell him that itwas there when she woke up. \"I just told him he couldn'thandle the rest of thestory. He could not figure it out, but wanted me to haveskin grafts and I told himno. He made the appointment and kept pestering me togo which I refused. I got ithealed up after several weeks and it is smooth, butstill quite red. The second timethat it happened it was at least the size of ahand spread out.\" I have been toldstories along the same lines by mind controland Satanic ritual victims in manyreligions because they are ultimately onereligion, the Illuminati. Staggeringly, inthe circumstances, Jane has shownenormous determination to recover hercompartmentalised mind and, as thiscontinues, more memories of what happenedflood back into her consciousnessreality. She has been helped, she said, by a deepfaith in Jesus. I find thatmany recovering mind slaves hold on to a strong belief inJesus and this appearsto be part of their programming. It's the double bind. Theyuse Jesus as theopposing polarity to \"Satan\" and play these off against each otherin thevictim's mind. So whichever aspect of the programming they access, theyareconnected to an Illuminati deity.Jehovah's mind control cultThe Jehovah's Witnesses, or Watchtower Society, is another Illuminatireligionused for mind control and a front for Satanism. It systematicallydisconnects itsmembers from non-members in the way of all mind-control cults.The Jehovah'sWitnesses are a replica of the Mormons, even down to theFreemasonic founders,like Charles Taze Russell. It's amazing how everything fitstogether in the worldof the Illuminati if you are prepared to dig deep enough.The people andorganisations that attack and abuse each other in public, orappear to be incompetition, turn out over and over to be different masks on thesame face. We aretold the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses are differentorganisations thatstand for different \"beliefs\" and the followers of both wouldbe aghast at thethought that they could be connected in any way. But the mass ofunthinkingfollowers in any religion are merely the fodder and the screen behindwhich thereal business goes on.Charles Taze Russell was from the Illuminati's Russell bloodline, whichalsofounded the infamous Skull and Bones Society at Yale University. Russell wasaSatanist, a paedophile according to his wife, and a friend of the Rothschilds.Indeedit was the Rothschilds who funded the Jehovah's Witness operation intoexistence,along with other Illuminati bankers. They enjoyed \"contributions\"fromorganisations like the Rothschild-controlled B'nai B'rith, which also helpedtheMormons. This was proved in a court of law in Switzerland in 1922, accordingtoresearcher, Fritz Springmeier. One of the key people involved in thesecontributions328Children of the Matrixwas Frank Goldman who later became President of B'nai B'rith. Why wouldanorganisation set up (in theory) to help Jewish people and promote the Jewishfaith,be funding the Jehovah's Witnesses? I think the name Rothschild answersthequestion. Charles Taze Russell was a high-degree Freemason and KnightsTemplar.He promoted Zionism, another Rothschild creation, on behalf of hisfriends andbackers.21 Russell's family was formerly known as Roessel and went toScotlandfrom Germany. Both are massive occult centres. Germany is where theRothschildsemerged and Scotland is one of the key areas of the world forIlluminatibloodlines.22From the start, Charles Russell used his new Watchtower Society, based atBethel,Brooklyn, New York, as a front for black magic, or Enochian magic as hisbrand ofSatanism was called. He put the flying Sun disk on the front of his books,anancient Illuminati symbol going back to Egypt and Babylon. TheWatchtowermagazine has always been a mass of subliminal and less subliminaloccultsymbolism and the very name, Watchtower, is part of Illuminati andFreemasoniclegend and code. To them watchtowers are areas of the \"magicaluniverse\", theunseen realms. Russell was buried under a pyramid in the UnitedStates after,according to some researchers, he was ritually killed on Halloween1917. As I'vesaid, these leading Satanists of the Illuminati are ritually killedwhen their timecomes, so their occult power can be passed on. The Jehovah'sWitness organisationis named over and over by survivors of trauma-based mindcontrol for beinginvolved, like the Mormon Church, in unspeakable mind controlprojects. TheMormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses are the same organisation atthe top levelwhere the El-ders of the Mormons and the Watchtower Society operatea verydifferent agenda to the one revealed to their followers.Jehovah's Witnesses are told to believe in and welcome Armageddon becausethat'sthe day the world will be destroyed and only they will avoid the holocaust.Webillions of non-believers will perish. But I am quite looking forward tothatwhen I think of what the world would be like with Jehovah's Witnesses incharge.The Jehovah prophets have predicted this Armageddon over and over sincetheirreligion was created, but as each date has passed, another date has beenannouncedto replace it. Witnesses and their children are separated from societyand only theminimum necessary contact with non-believers is encouraged. Thisisolates themfrom other information and visions of reality, and families arebroken up bydisconnecting Witnesses from non-Witnesses. While this isolationfrom mainstreamsociety goes on, they attend meetings three times each week to bebrainwashed withthe religion's dogma, hatred, and fear. Look at these examplesfrom their ownpublications:\"Is it proper for a Christian witness of Jehovah to have business relationshipswithone who has been disfellowshipped? Generally speaking, it would be desirablefor usto have no contact with disfellowshipped persons, either in business or insocial andspiritual ways.\"(The Watchtower, December 1st 1952, p 735)329\"In the case of the disfellowshipped relative who does not live in the samehouse,contact with him is also kept to what is absolutely necessary. As withsecularemployment, this contact is limited and even curtailed completely if atall possible.\"(The Watchtower, July 15th 1963, p 443)\"In faithfulness to God, none in the congregation should greet such personswhenmeeting them in public, nor should they welcome these into theirhomes.\"(Organization, 1972 ed. p 172)As always with mind-control cults, which all religions are in the end, there isthepressure not to think or question:\"Avoid independent thinking! How is such independent thinking manifested?A common way is by questioning the council that is provided by God'svisibleorganization.\"(The Watchtower, January 15th 1983, p 22)\"Fight Against Independent Thinking! Yet there are some who point out thattheorganization has had to make adjustments before, and so they argue: thatshowsthat we have to make up our own mind on what we believe. This isindependentthinking. Why is it the danger? Such thinking is an evidence ofpride.\"(The Watchtower, January 15th 1983, p 27)And then there is the call for Witnesses to hate in the name of their god.Veryappropriate given the hateful nature of the Biblical Jehovah:\"In order to hate what is bad a Christian must hate the person with whomthebadness is inseparably linked.\"(The Watchtower, July 15th 1961, p 420)\"We must hate in the truest sense, which is to regard extreme and activeaversion, toconsider as loathsome, odious, filthy, to detest. Surely any hatersof God are not fitto live on his beautiful Earth. What do you do with anythingloathsome or repugnantthat you detest and abhor? The answer is simple. You getaway from it or removefrom your presence. You do not want to have anything atall to do with it. This mustbe exactly our attitude toward the haters ofJehovah.\"(The Watchtower, October 1st 1952, p 599)1 have met many people who have seen their families destroyed by theJehovah'sWitnesses and their mental dictatorship. Children will not talk to theirparents,brothers and sisters (and vice versa) because they believe them to be evilfornot worshipping Jehovah. When people leave the organisation, no matter howmuchthey may have served its cause, they are treated like lepers and theirchildrenwho remain in the religion, are told to hate them and refuse to speak330Children of the Matrixwith them. The former Witness who sent those Watchtower quotes to mywebsite,wrote:\"I was a Jehovah Witness for 37 years. I disassociated myself from theorganizationdue to the extreme control and manipulation of the people. Because Ichoose not tobe a Jehovah Witness I am ostracized and shunned. I am not allowedto see myrelatives that are still trapped in a hard and cold and unforgivingreligion. I am notallowed to see my nieces and nephews. The shunning laws arebreaking up manyfamilies, causing many divorces, also driving people tosuicide.\"23But then what does the Watchtower leadership care? The organisation is notthereto serve the interests of its members. It is there, and always has been, toservethe Illuminati. Witnesses are discouraged from listening to popularmusic,celebrating festivals and holidays with non-witnesses, and urged to readthe Bibleevery day. The way they should interpret that Bible, however, is laiddown by thehierarchy in Brooklyn, New York (one of the Illuminati's globalcentres). They aretold to take everything literally and so when Acts 15:29speaks of the need to\"abstain from blood\", the Jehovah's Witnesses refuse bloodtransfusions even if itmeans their child will die. What greater level of mindcontrol can you have thanthat? Hebrews 10:25 says: \"Do not forsake the gatheringof yourselves together\"and this is used to pressure people to attend KingdomHall meetings five times aweek. Not only the minds, but the clothing andhairstyles of the Witnesses aremonitored. Every area of their lives is dictated,including the movies and televisionprogrammes they should and should not watch;celebrating birthdays; lotteries;relationships after divorce; inter-racialmarriage; drinking tea and coffee; wearingcosmetics and jewellery; nationalanthems; contraception methods; oral sex inmarriage, and masturbation. Thelatter is forbidden, but then just allowing yourselfto take this crap wouldqualify you for the title of \"wanker\", surely? While allWitnesses may not submitto all of these impositions to begin with, the repetitiondefeats them in the endwith the power of the group submerging the individual.Serious rebellion is\"counselled\" and the threat made of \"disfellowship\". Somehave been thrown outfor documenting the provable errors in Watchtower literatureand history. Noquestioning or rebellion against the leadership is tolerated, andWitnesses arepressured to inform on each other. This creates thenowhere-to-run,no-where-to-hide, mentality that is always used in mind controloperations. Themicro-chip and the explosion of spy cameras are designed to havethe same effecton the collective mind. Doing anything \"wrong\" becomes sodifficult to keepprivate and the consequences of it become so harsh that in theend the mostdetermined of rebels can be worn down and battered into conforming.EncouragingWitnesses to \"confess their sins\" to an El-der opens the way forunlimitedblackmail. Nor is the privacy of these confessions maintained, asformer Witnesseshave confirmed. They are kept in a constant state of fear andunworthiness, anotherfoundation of mind control programmes. If you want to giveyour mind and yourlife away, join the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses. In fact,join any religion.If you look through the Religious Archives on my website, you will see thescaleof Satanism and child abuse in the churches of all denominations.Protestant,Catholic, Mormon, Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostal, all of them. Andthey are afraction of the cases that are known, let alone the far greater numberthat gounreported. What is even more sickening is the way such crimes againstchildrenand others are covered up to protect the \"good name\" of the church. Notonly arethe stories on which the churches are founded a blatant fabrication,they do noteven follow the more positive aspects of those faiths. The mostsenior RomanCatholic in Britain, the Archbishop of Westminster, has been exposedfor allowinga known paedophile to continue working as a priest. The churchsecretly paidcompensation to two of his victims to keep them quiet and theynever informedthe police. The priest, Father Michael Hill, was sheltered frompublic exposure byArchbishop Murphy-O'Connor and appointed as chaplain toGatwick Airport.There he abused a youngster who missed his flight and went tothe airport chapelfor comfort. Hill was jailed for five years in 1997. One ofhis many victims, thenaged nine, told BBC radio: \"He used to come in to me,kneel next to my bed andstart reading me stories about Jesus...you know, theLord...and he used to put hishand under the cover and down my pyjama bottoms. Iused to hate it, you know,my worst nightmare.” Archbishop Muiphy-O'Connor, a manofficially appointedby the Pope, was warned in 1983 that Hill was a childabuser, but continued tosupport him. The Archbishop says the church takes childprotection veryseriously. Oh really? I think priest protection and own-skinprotection is arather higher priority.The new age, old age, religionYou would not think, on the face of it, that Christianity would have anythingincommon with the so-called \"New Age\", but it has. The New Age claims tohaverejected the official religions to pursue a \"personal\" and \"direct\"connection withwhat we call \"God\". In fact, while I have much in common with themetaphysicalbasis of much \"New Age” thought, that's where the connection ends.The \"NewAge\" is just the latest Illuminati religion created to seize the mindsof those whocannot be imprisoned by official religion or what we bravely call\"science\".Understanding the metaphysical nature of multi-density,multi-dimensional life, isfar too close to the truth. Something must be done. Sovast swathes of the New Ageis populated by those in the ultimate illusion: thosewho are convinced they arethinking and feeling for themselves when they havesimply given then- minds awayto another master. It could be a \"channelled\"entity from another density, \"AshtarCommand\" (an Illuminati-created myth of someextraterrestrial \"saviours\"), or theapparently endless stream of gurus and\"Living Gods on Earth\". I have seen manyover the years on videos and atconferences of various kinds. The audience are inawe of these people and yet atleast the majority, are either multi-personalityprogrammed operatives for theIlluminati or consciously conning their followers.There is no difference betweenthese New Age heroes and the television \"Christian\"evangelists who fleece andmislead the watching millions. The times I have heard332Children of the Matrixthese New Age saviours saying that some entity or other had said this or thathadhappened or was happening when it was provably not true. One guy toldhisfawning audience that he and his team had changed the vibration of thevehiclepollution in Phoenix, Arizona, and so dramatically reduced the fumes.This claimwas greeted with wild applause. So when 1 drove through Phoenix laterthat sameday, the fume cloud hanging over city and the pollution 1 breathed inmust havebeen a figment of my imagination.Sigh Baa, Baa1 can offer no greater example of the New Age conmen and the millions whohandover their minds to them, than Sai Baba. This guy is a guru figureworshipped as a\"Living God on Earth\" by vast numbers of people worldwide and atall levels ofsociety. He operates from his \"Ashram” in Puttaparthi, India.Thousands go thereand just sit in vacant awe at this man in the long orangefrock. I attended an eventonce in England in which the audience was asked tosing a song of worship to SaiBaba by a woman almost overcome with emotion forthis \"god\". But do you knowwho Sai Baba really is? A paedophile, con man, thiefand almost certainly worse.Don't take my word for it. Ask people who have workedclosely with him for 20years and more. Long-time Baba devotees, Faye and DavidBailey, have massivelyexposed him as a colossal fraud from their own experiencesand by collatingevidence from countless others who have seen that Baba is amanufactured myth.The accounts of his sexual abuse of children, teenagers, andadult men, areenormous, and he is described as a thoroughly vicious piece ofwork. He is famousfor producing \"vibhuti\", an ash substance, and \"valuable\"watches, rings, andtrinkets \"out of nowhere\", by manifesting them from anotherdimension. TheBaileys, and the stream of testimonies they have compiled, provedthat the\"vibhuti\" was manufactured in tablets from roasted cow dung and kepthiddenbetween Baba's third and fourth fingers until required to \"manifest\".The\"valuable\" jewellery turned out to be worthless trinkets purchased in thelocalvillage and elsewhere. Baba \"materialised\" a ring for David Bailey, which,the livinggod told him, was of great commercial value. When he took it to ajeweller insouthern India for repair, the man in the shop immediately recognisedit as a \"SaiBaba ring”. He said that the stone was a valueless zircon andunderneath he wouldfind a piece of silver paper to make the zircon glitter. Whenthe stone was removed,there indeed was the silver paper and the jeweller saidthat the rings were madeespecially for Baba to \"manifest\". The Baileys alsodocument how Baba has connedpeople and the local community out of tens ofmillions of dollars and how he isimplicated in a number of murders. This is theman to whom millions haveconceded their minds, left their families, and marriedothers purely on Baba's sayso. For the full details of Baba's child abuse andcon trickery, contact Faye andDavid Bailey, read their quarterly newsletter. TheFindings,24 and see the ReligiousArchives on my website.Religion and much of its New Age mirror is a cesspit of lies,corruption,hypocrisy, and iniquity. By that I don't mean everyone who goes tochurch, follows'Spiritual\" satanism and \"Christian\" conmen333a faith, or operates within New Age circles. Hundreds of millions ofgenuinepeople are involved in the old religions and the New Age. 1 mean thosewhocontrol these Illuminati fronts and use them as a veil for the very behaviourandabuse they claim to oppose. But they say there is one born every minute and,withreligion, it must be every ten seconds. These guys can only manipulatereligion soeffortlessly because there seems to be an endless supply of peopledesperate togive their minds away. When the Baileys began to expose Sai Baba, acouple of hisdevotees phoned to say that they knew that what was being exposedwas true. But,the couple said, \"...he is God and God can do anything he likes\".There are stillChristians being injured and even killed who handle snakes. Theydo this becauseit says in Mark's Gospel, Chapter 16, Verse 17: \"They shall takeup serpents.\"Dewey Chafin, quoted in the American People Magazine, said: \"See, 1handleserpents because it's in the Bible, like a commandment. And 1 drinkstrychninebecause the Bible says it won't hurt me. Now, either every word inthat Bible isright or it's wrong.\"And a few people can't control the world? It's a doddle.SOURCES1 Dr. Loreda Fox, The Spiritual And Clinical Dimensions Of Multiple PersonalityDisorder(Books of Sangre de Cristo, Salida, Colorado), p 1962 Written in letters to a church minister and quoted in Blasphemous Rumours3 See http://www.angelfire.com/ut/branton and http://www.reptilianagenda.com/4 The Illuminati Formula, pp 126 to 150.

If we take a deep breath and refocus our eyes, the humanpredicamentcould hardly be clearer. For the few to control the many, decisionsaffecting the manymust be made by the few. This demands the constantcentralisation of power over allaspects of life. And if you wish to control theentire planet, as the Anunnaki-Illuminati do, the major decisions must be madeat a global level. Now look at whathas been happening throughout these thousandsof years since the last cataclysm.First there was Sumer - a centralised empirecontrolled by the same bloodlines.When that dismantled amid the squabbles of the\"gods\", this empire collapsed intoits individual parts and, for a time,decision-making was decentralised. But theAnunnaki covert empire, which thenbegan, has manipulated the world once moreto the brink global dictatorship. Infact, in most areas of our lives, that is already thecase. As the bloodlines andtheir influence expanded, especially from the Near andMiddle East, tribes havebeen brought together into nations; the nations are beingbrought together intopower blocs like the European Union; and the final stage,which we are now seeingunfold, is to bring the power blocs together under a worldgovernment, centralbank, currency, and army. Game, set, and match to the shape-shifters - unless weawake from our hypnotic state. All this is not by accident, but bycoldlycalculated design and the structure they are planning to introduce can be seeninFigure 41 (overleaf). Without it, the centralised control of the world bytheAnunnaki would not be possible. Try controlling from the centre if the keydecisionsaffecting countries and communities are being made by those whoactually live thereand care for the freedom of their fellow citizens. You wouldhave such a potentialdiversity of decision-making and, therefore, decisions,that you could not guide theworld in the direction that suits your agenda. Theco-ordination would not bepossible to make all the individual parts decide thesame thing. But if you create astructure in which global policy in politics,business, finance, media, and military isdecided by world bodies, all controlledby the same force, you can dictate to theentire human race while calling it\"democratic freedom\".336Children of the MatrixPicture #79 [images/img_0079.png]Figure 41: The global fascist structure the Illuminati have been working towardsfor so long. We can see theworld moving in this direction every dayThe more you centralise, the more power you have over people and events, andsothe more you can centralise. This is one reason why the pace of the agendahasquickened, especially in the last 150 years, and is continuing to do so.Gathering thetribes together into nations took the longest time, but once thatwas achievedeverything became so much easier. The takeover of the NativeAmerican lands bythe Europeans was a wonderful example of how a vast culture ofdiverse tribes anddecision-making was fused into a centrally controlled nation,the United States.This was achieved in a relatively short time because by thenthe Illuminati had builta power base within the nations of Europe, particularly,in this example, Britain andFrance. Under the tribal system, it was impossiblefor the Illuminati to centrallycontrol the Native Americans. But under the USFederal Government, it is child'splay to dictate centrally to a nation of some260 million people today. I am notsuggesting that we need to go back to livingin tee-pees or caves, or operating intribes. It is the level at which decisionsare made that I am highlighting here. Youcan have a modern society and stillhave diversity of decision-making. TheIlluminati are desperate for you tobelieve that this is impossible, and that the morewe advance technologically themore we must centralise everything. This is nottrue; they just want you tobelieve that so they can justify their agenda.The European fascist dictatorshipThe Illuminati global web is now a maze of interconnected secret andsemi-secretgroups who are manipulating to the same end: the centralisation ofpower in allareas of our lives. It is these groups that have been responsiblefor the emergence ofPicture #80 [images/img_0080.png]Figure 42: The fasciae is a symbolof the Roman Empire, from whichwe get theterm, fascism. Itsymbolises individuality (people,countries) being tied togetherandruled from above by the symbolicaxe head - the Illuminatithe centralised fascist state called the European Union. Its structure is amirror ofthe very symbol, the fasciae, from which the word fascism came. Thefasciae is asymbol from the Roman Empire. It is a bundle of rods tied togetherwith an axehead at the top symbolising the destruction of diversity and theimposition of top-down dictatorship (Figure 42). This symbol is used by manysecret societies, like theKnights of Columbus in the United States (Figure 43),and can also be found in theUS Congress Building and on the seal of the State ofColorado (Figure 44). The rodsare the countries of Europe and the axe is thecentralised dictatorship that nowcontrols them. The European Union is classicfascism and this is precisely thegoverning structure they want for the world.The ”EU\" is a 100% Illuminaticreation, manipulated into being by covertoperators and a network oforganisations co-ordinated by a secret society calledthe Round Table. This was firstheaded by the infamous Illuminati operative CecilRhodes, who left money to fundso-called \"Rhodes Scholarships\", which continue tofinance the expenses andeducation of Illuminati-selected students from aroundthe world to attend OxfordUniversity. Here they are schooled to becomeIlluminati agents and, if they agree toserve their masters, they go back totheir countries and later enter significantpositions of power. Bill Clinton isan excellent example of a Rhodes Scholar andso is the former Australian PrimeMinister Bob Hawke. The Rhodes Scholarshipnetwork connects with the Round Tableand the rest of the web, and OxfordUniversity is the centre of the Illuminatimanipulation of global \"education\". It is nocoincidence that an area near thepresent Oxford University was the site of one ofthe earliest Druid initiationschools founded in Britain.The round table networkIn...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I have documented in detail how theEuropeanUnion was founded by Illuminati placemen like Jean Monnet, Count RichardN.Coudenhove-Kalergi, Joseph Retinger, and others. They were the public face fortheforces manipulating the creation of the centralised European dictatorship wesee today.Retinger, a Polish \"socialist\", was also involved with Prince Bernhardof ThePicture #81 [images/img_0081.png]337Picture #82 [images/img_0082.png]Figures 43 and 44: Flere we see the symbol of fascism used in thelogo of the USsecret society, the Knights of Columbus, and on thestate seal of ColoradoPicture #83 [images/img_0083.png]338Children of the MatrixNetherlands, in the formation of the Bilderberg Group. This is anIlluminatioperation funded by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. It wasofficially namedafter the Bilderberg Hotel in The Netherlands where its firstofficial meeting tookplace in May 1954, but Bil can have many connotations.\"Bil\", for instance, wasanother name for \"Thor\", the first king of Sumer,according to the Edda, and Bil alsorelates to Bel, the ancient Sun God.Bil-der-berg actually translates, apparently, as\"Bil or Bel of the Mountain\".The Bilderberg Group is co-ordinated by lovers ofhumanity like David Rockefellerand Henry Kissinger. Prince Bernhard, a GermanHabsburg and former Nazi SSofficer, married into the Dutch royal family, theMerovingian House of Orange.This is the same bloodline as William of Orangewho played such a pivotal rolefor the Illuminati when he sat on the British throne,signed the charter tocreate the Bank of England, and started conflicts in Ireland thatcontinue tothis day. The House of Orange connects into the Orange Order, a\"protestant\" secret society involved in the conflict in Northern Ireland. TheOrangeOrder, in turn, connects into the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, and soon.Bernhard is a close associate of Prince Philip and they operate that Illuminatifront,the Worldwide Fund for Nature, which is exposed at length in The BiggestSecret.What a coincidence that all the key players behind the formation andsubsequentcentralisation of the European Union have been attendees of theBilderberg Group,which has pursued a policy for the centralised control ofEurope since it wasofficially created in 1954! The very official suggestion to form the BilderbergGroupcame from Joseph Retinger, one of the founders of the European Community,nowUnion, and Prince Bernhard. The present chairman of the Bilderberg Group istheViscount Etienne Davignon, another bloodline placeman with the perfectcareerrecord. He was vice-chairman of the European Commission in the 1980s,andChairman of Societe Generale De Belgique - the massive banking andutilityconglomerate in Belgium. He is also chairman of the Illuminati front, theEuropeanRound Table of Industrialists. This formulates policy for the EuropeanCommission,which then dictates to the European Union. Davignon is a founder member andpresident of AMUE, the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, as wellasbeing a member of David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission, theEuropeanInstitute in Washington, and a director of Anglo-American mining.Europeanmonetary union is a progression to the world currency. In his positionas IndustryCommissioner in the 1980s, Davignon was instrumental in turningEuropeaninstitutions from supporting small business to supporting big business.He did thisby getting European industrialists, through his European Round Table ofIndustrialists, to draft European policy This anti-democratic practice continuestothis day. No wonder the Bilderberg elite chose this guy to replace LordCarrington,the Rothschild bloodline, who was the Secretary-General of NATObefore becomingBilderberg chairman in 1991.The Bilderberg Group (Bil) is part of a network of organisations, which areallmasks on the same Illuminati face. They are controlled by the same people andhavedifferent roles to play in advancing the agenda of global centralisation.The othersare the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London (RIIA), theCouncil onPicture #84 [images/img_0084.png]Picture #85 [images/img_0085.png]Picture #86 [images/img_0086.png]Foreign Relations (CFR) in theUnited States, and the TrilateralCommission (TC),whichoperates in the United States,Europe, and the Far East. Fromthis point 1will indicatemembers and attendees of thesegroups by using thoseabbreviationsafter their names.They are satellite organisationsorbiting their central core,thesecret society called the RoundTable (see Figure 45). It was elitemembers ofthe Round Table inBritain and the United Stateswho manipulated the FirstWorldWar and wrote the\"Balfour Declaration\" in 1917 inwhich the BritishGovernmentofficially announced its supportfor a Jewish homeland inFigure 45: The Round Table network. Different masks on Palestine (see ...And TheTruththe same face Shall Set You Free for thebackground detail). The Balfour Declaration was a letter sent by Ford Balfour,theForeign Secretary and elite member of the Round Table, to Ford FionelWalterRothschild, who was funding the Round Table. The Rothschilds havecontrolledIsrael since its foundation and funded the terrorist groups thatbombed it intoexistence. This, by the way, is not a condemnation of Jewishpeople living in Israel,just a comment on the merciless way they and others havebeen manipulated byforces they have no idea exist.The Bilderberg Group and the other strands of the Round Table network haveamongtheir number the top people in global politics, business, banking,media,military, \"education\", almost every aspect of human life. It is their jobto co-ordinatethe same policy through apparently unconnected countries,political parties,military commands, newspapers and media, business andfinancial organisations.These people are compartmentalised, as with allIlluminati operations, and there arebasically three levels: 1 the inner core whoknow the big picture, and these areAnunnaki shape-shifters; 2 the regularattendees who know most of the picture, andthey will be Anunnaki shape-shifterslower down the hierarchy; 3 those who areinvited to a Bilderberg meeting becausethe Illuminati require a certain course ofaction from them at a particular time.Many of these will not be Anunnakibloodlines, just manipulated stooges, who havetheir egos massaged and are madeto think they have \"arrived\" on the world stageby such an invitation to rubshoulders with the \"big boys\". These guys will knowlittle, often nothing, of the340Children of the MatrixIlluminati agenda. I have been talking and writing about the Bilderberg Groupformore than 11 years and older researchers have been doing so for a lot longer.Thosefew journalists who even bothered to listen have dismissed this informationas acrazy \"conspiracy theory\", but even some of those are now having to thinkagain,purely by the weight of evidence. However, much as I welcome theincreasedattention focused on the Bilderberg Group and its network, I wouldstress that thisis not the conspiracy, as many believe. It is merely onecompartment of it. I have metBilderberg researchers who have a padlocked mind tothe wider conspiracy ofwhich that is only a small part. The Bilderberg Group isnot even close to being thecentre of the conspiracy. It is an interface betweenthe Illuminati and global politics,banking, business, etc., that's all. It iscontrolled by far more elite secret societiesthat dictate its actions andpolicy. Even the Round Table is not the top of thepyramid, only another strandin the web. Discovering the Bilderberg Group is to seeone entrance to thelabyrinth, not to locate its core.I can give you a feel for how the manipulation works by listing some oftheBilderberg attendees. The Secretary-General of NATO, the head of thebiggestmilitary force in the world, is appointed by the Bilderberg Group, aprivateorganisation that 99.9999% of the human race has never heard of. Take thelast sixSecretary-Generals alone, Joseph Luns, Lord Carrington, Willy Claes,ManfredWoener, Javier Solana, and George Robertson. All are Bilderbergers. Howmanypeople know that? Exactly. And how many know that James Wolfensohn,thePresident of the World Bank (and Rothschild partner), and heads of the WorldTradeOrganization like Peter D. Sutherland and Renato Ruggerio, areBilderbergers? OrUS President Bill Clinton, UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, theGerman ChancellorGerhard Schroeder, and his predecessors, Kohl, Brant, andSchmidt? Or previousBritish prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher, James Callaghan,Harold Wilson, TedHeath, and Sir Alec Douglas Hume, a former Bilderbergchairman? Hardly anyoneknows this, including most members of their own parties!It was shape-shifter TedHeath who signed the UK into the European \"Community\" in1972 andgovernment documents recently released under Britain's \"30-year rule\",haveshown that Heath knew from the start that this would lead to acentralisedEuropean state. It was Douglas Hurd, Heath's close associate, whosigned usfurther into the web with the Maastricht Agreement in February 1992,which turneda \"free trade area\" into political union. Since then thecentralisation of power hascontinued to advance with the single Europeancurrency, the Euro, and now theyare talking of a full-blown United States ofEurope that will make nation states mereadministrators of European law. Theyvirtually are now. That has been Illuminatipolicy going back almost a thousandyears to the founding of the Knights Templar.They wanted a United States ofEurope even then.I said way back in the 1990s that the Labour Party's Tony Blair (Bil) wouldbebrought to power in Britain to take us further towards the single Europeancurrencyand destroy British sovereignty. That is precisely what he is doing andunlessBritish people wake up - and fast - this is going to happen. Among theprominent\"opposition\" Conservatives supporting Tony Blair (Bil) in the policy oftaking theUK into the Euro are Ted Heath (Bil), Kenneth Clarke (Bil), and Lord Howe(Bil).Because the Illuminati bloodlines are in the positions of power all overthe world,they can activate apparently unconnected people in support of theIlluminatiagenda. Thus we have the heads of Japanese corporations with factoriesin the UKthreatening to close them if the UK does not join the single Europeancurrency. TonyBlair is delighted with these statements, of course, because theymake his job easier.The manipulation of fear is the greatest weapon thereptilians have. Everything isbased on this, and that's the idea behind thewarnings from Japanese corporations.The Illuminati plan is to create Americanand Pacific Unions based on the samestructure we have in Europe. One wouldencompass the whole of the Americas andthe other would control theAsia-Australia region. The Illuminati are preparing touse the same method theyemployed in Europe by evolving these political unionsout of the \"free tradeareas\" called the North American Free Trade Agreement orNAFTA, and the AsiaPacific Economic Co-operation or APEC. Presidents fatherGeorge, Bill Clinton,and now \"boy\" George, have all called for an Americas-wideextension of NAFTA. 1said years ago that the Canadian currency would beartificially depressed toencourage the Canadian public to replace their currencywith the US dollar aspart of this political and economic union of the Americas. That\"debate\" has nowbegun as the value of the Canadian dollar has collapsed. Youdon't have to be aprophet to predict the future; an understanding of the Illuminatiand their plansis quite sufficient.The following are among the main foundations of their agenda. Some arealreadyhappening and others are in the process of being manipulated to happen.While 1was writing this book in December 2000, it was agreed that the EuropeanUnionwould expand to include a dozen more countries and that many moredecisions wouldbe made by majority voting. In other words, countries would losefurther rightsto say \"no\" to a policy agreed by the European Union centralisedstate. TonyBlair made much of the fact that he refused to agree to majority votingon taxand social security decisions and this allowed him to paint it as a \"victory\"forBritain's national sovereignty. In fact, that was a smokescreen behind whichtheIlluminati plan for a European dictatorship could advance still further.The world governmentThe United Nations was a vital achievement for the Illuminati. They tried andfailedwith their League of Nations after the First World War and so theyengineered theSecond World War to batter nations into agreeing to a global\"forum\" to replace, inWinston Churchill's phrase, \"war, war” with \"jaw, jaw.”But as the Illuminati wellknew, as did the committee of the Council on ForeignRelations that wrote thecharter, the UN was only a stalking horse for afully-fledged world government. Itis the same ruse played out to evolve theEuropean Union out of the European\"Common Market\". The plan has always been tocreate so many \"problems\" in theworld that the only answer to them is perceivedto be a global government to \"sortout the mess\" (problem-reaction-solution).What the public has not been told - untilnow - is that those pressing for theworld government are the same people who are342Children of the Matrixcreating the problems to justify it. Another scam is to persuade us that aworldgovernment would be the way to bring all people together as one humanity,caringand sharing, and recognising we are all one family. Very nice sentiment onthe faceof it, but from the Illuminati point of view, that is their worstnightmare. They wanthumanity to be divided and ruled not united and free. Theyuse terms like the\"Global Village\", \"Global Commons\", \"Global Neighbourhood\" and\"One World\"to manipulate people into missing the fundamental difference between\"OneWorld” (coming together in mutual support and co-operation) and aglobalcentralised fascist dictatorship. Wasn't the United Nations supposed toachieve allthe goals they are claiming for the world government? It's like thecarrot and thedonkey. They sell you a solution that involves centralisation andwhen that doesn'twork (on purpose) they sell you another solution that involvesmore centralisation.The Illuminati, as my other books document, controlled thepeople who created theUnited Nations and they have controlled those who haveadministered its policy tothis day. Even its headquarters in New York is builton land donated by theRockefeller family, who also donated the land for theheadquarters of the League ofNations. The UN building was previously the site ofa slaughterhouse. With theIlluminati obsessed with blood sacrifice andsymbolism, that is no coincidence.The world central bank and currencyMoney, together with fear, are the main weapons of human control. When youfollowthe bloodlines through history there are a number of themes thatconstantlyrecur: human sacrifice and blood rituals, war and conflict, and thesystem oflending people \"money\" that doesn't exist and charging interest on it.When you gointo a bank and agree a \"loan\" they don't print a single new note,mint a single newcoin, or move an ounce of precious metal a single inch. Theysimply type into youraccount the amount they have agreed to \"loan\". They havecreated \"money\" out ofnothing and it has cost them nothing to do it. But fromthat moment you startpaying them interest on that \"money\" which has never andwill never exist. Theycall this \"credit\". The same force, the Illuminati, whichcreated the banking systemand controls all the banks, also created the politicalsystem and controls all themajor governments. This has allowed these governmentsto pass banking laws thatallow their banks to lend at least, and it is at least,ten times what they have ondeposit. In truth, it is far more than that. Everytime you put a pound or dollar in abank, you are giving them the right to lendten pounds or dollars they do not have.This system of so-called \"fiat\" money and\"fractional reserve lending\", means thathanks can create money out of thin airwhenever they choose. The deluge of debt,with which people, businesses, andgovernments constantly battle, is this samefresh-air \"money\". Personal debt,national debt, \"Third World\" debt - all of it. Noneof this really exists, exceptas figures on a computer screen. Think about thesuffering, poverty, and deaththat these crushing debts cause every day and yet theyare just figures on ascreen written by a clerk in a bank. Nothing more. Imagine howthe world wouldchange if money was created interest free? They tell you that thiscan't be donebecause that's what they want you to believe. Of course it can. BothPresident Kennedy and President Lincoln began to issue interest-free money.Whatelse do these two men have in common?Governments could create their own interest-free money and remove instantlytheneed to pay fantastic sums in interest to the private banks. Isn't that simplecommon sense? Then why does no government or major opposition party eversuggestit? Answer: (a) the Illuminati who control the banks control thegovernments andthe hierarchies of the major political parties; and (b) most of thelower politicians in these parties are stunningly uninformed about the moneysystem. I have even had to explain how money is created to professional\"economists\" before now. I kid you not. I met a retired bank manager inEnglandsome years ago and it was only in the last months before his retirementthat itdawned on him that all the money he had been lending for the bankthroughout hiscareer was just an illusion. It had never actually existed. In theUnited States thetrillions of dollars of government debt, serviced by the sweatand toil of the people,is \"owed\" to the US \"central bank\", the Federal Reserve.This was launched in 1913by agents for the Rothschild, Rockefeller, and J.P.Morgan banking families (see...And The Truth Shall Set You Free) and, eversince, the US government hasborrowed its \"money\" from the \"Fed\". The head of theFederal Reserve is currentlythe Illuminati Satanist Alan Greenspan (Bil, TC,CFR), who took over from Paul A.Volker (Bil, TC, CFR). You get the picture.Greenspan attends the rituals atBohemian Grove and, according to Phillip Eugenede Rothschild, is high up in theIlluminati ritual hierarchy. The \"Fed\" decidesthe interest rates in the US, a fact thathas a fundamental effect on the worldeconomy because of the interdependency theIlluminati have built into theirsystem. It makes centralised control so much easier ifyou have key power centreswhere the decisions have a global effect, and frontmenlike Greenspan ensure thatone individual holds such power. It is worth noting thatthe first policy changemade by the UK government of Tony Blair (Bil) was theannouncement by hisChancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown (Bil), that interestrates would nolonger be set by the elected government, but by theIlluminati'sRothschild-controlled Bank of England, run by its governor, EddieGeorge (Bil).Americans believe that because the word \"Federal\" appears in the title thattheFederal Reserve is part of their Federal Government. This is not true. TheFederalReserve is neither federal nor has any reserve. It is a cartel of privatebankscontrolled from Europe, i.e. the Rothschilds and the Illuminati. It has notproducedaudited accounts since it was formed in 1913 and yet this is the sourceof thenational debt in the United States. This is how it works. When thegovernmentwants to borrow money it issues a government \"bond\" or \"IOU\" to the bank, sayfor a billion dollars. The bank then prints a billion dollars or simply createsit on ascreen and this costs the \"Fed\" nothing because it pays the negligiblecost of a fewthousand dollars with more fresh-air \"money\". From that moment theUS taxpayerbegins to pay the privately-owned \"Fed\" interest on a billiondollars. More thanthat, the government's IOU, now in the Fed's hands, is countedas an asset of thebank and so it can now lend ten times its \"value\" (in this case ten billiondollars)and charge interest on that, too. This is happening in every country inthe world!344Children of the MatrixWhen you go into a bank and sign over \"collateral\" for a loan, the same scamisplayed. Your house, land, or business is counted as an asset of the bank andtheycan lend ten times its estimated value to other customers. When you take outa loanyou are borrowing your own wealth and paying the bank for the privilege.Also, thebanks have a system known as \"bank trades,\" which allows them infinitepotentialfor loan \"capital\". If, even by these ludicrous banking laws, a bank does nothaveenough on deposit to make a certain loan, it \"borrows\" money from anothersource.That source only has to put money on deposit at the bank for a shortperiod - amonth, even a few days - and during that time the bank can legallymake a loan often times the figure the outside source has deposited. Once theloan has been made,the source gets its money returned, plus a massive interestpayment for its trouble.There is no need for anyone to be hungry or in povertyin this world. This ispurposely engineered through the system of \"money\" and debt created by theIlluminati. The central banks are part of one network, the same as the oilcompanies, and they are all controlled by the Illuminati bloodlines. The Bank ofInternational Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, and the InternationalBankingCommission, are the bodies that co-ordinate the policies of theapparentlyunconnected central banks. See ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free andThe BiggestSecret for the fine detail and sources of what you are reading inthis chapter.The public does not have a clue where money comes from. They just have somevagueidea that the \"government\" prints it or something. In truth, all except afraction of the \"money\" in the world comes into circulation through the privatebanks making \"loans\" of non-existent \"credit\". So \"money\" comes into \"existence\"as a debt from the very start because \"money\" is brought into circulation by thebanks issuing a loan or \"credit\". In this way, the banks (ultimately controlledby thesame people) have complete control over how much \"money\" is in circulation.Andthe money in circulation decides if we have an economic boom or depression.People suddenly deciding they don't want to work, buy things, or have a home,isnot the cause of economic depressions. They happen when there are not enoughunits of exchange (\"money\") in circulation to generate the economic activitythatprovides the necessary employment and income. Who controls how much \"money\"is in circulation? The Illuminati banks do. The following is a summary of howthe\"economic cycle\" has been played out for centuries.First you make lots of loans at low interest rates to encourage people toborrowmoney from you. This increases dramatically the amount of money incirculationand so makes more available for people to spend. This stimulates anincrease indemand for, and production of, products and that creates more jobs. We have a\"boom\". It is an interesting fact that people tend to get into more debt duringaboom because they are so confident financially that they borrow more money tobuy a bigger car, bigger house, and better holidays. Companies borrow more fromthe banks to buy new machinery to meet the increased \"demand\". The stockmarkets explode and people invest more of their money in this global casino,eventaking out loans to do so. Then, when this \"boom\" reaches the optimum pointforthe sting to be most effective, the banks, under central co-ordination, beginto take345money out of circulation. They push up interest rates through their FederalReserve,Bank of England, and other central banks. Suddenly a lot of money thathad beencirculating and buying products is withdrawn to pay the higher rates tothe banks,and banks change their policy to ensure that they make fewer newloans.Eventually, more \"money\" is coming out of circulation than is going in andthere isnot enough money in circulation to buy all the products and servicesavailable.People begin to lose their jobs. These job losses increase the rate ofeconomicdepression because those people no longer have the money to purchasewhat theydid before. With no other jobs available, the unemployed lose theirhomes, theirfamilies go hungry, and businesses go bust. These homes andbusinesses werebought with \"loans\" of fresh-air \"money\" from the hanks. In doingso, theborrowers agreed that the banks were entitled to those homes andbusinesses if theydid not keep up the payments. The depression, created by thebanks, now gives thehanks the right to confiscate all that real wealth - houses,land, business propertyand assets - in exchange for loaning nothing more thanfigures on a screen. In short,the banks make lots of loans in stage one and thenwithdraw so much money fromcirculation that there is not enough to pay themback. This ensures that they canlegally steal the real wealth of the people.This is what smart-suited, and mostlythoroughly ignorant, \"economicscorrespondents\" on the television news call the\"natural economic cycle\". Thereis nothing natural about it. The whole thing is ascam. The fishing line is castin stage one, the \"boom\", and then reeled in duringstage two, the \"depression\".This cycle of manipulation has been played out forhundreds and even thousands ofyears, back to the banking operation of theKnights Templar and to Babylon andbeyond. This is the cycle that has sucked thereal wealth of the world into thehands of the tiny few and it still goes on.Now the Illuminati are planning to complete their financial control of thehumanrace with a world central bank and one global electronic currency. Thisbank wouldmake all the major financial decisions affecting every country. Thecurrency wouldeventually bring an end to physical \"cash\" and all othercurrencies. While I waswriting this book, a UK paper called Metro reported onDecember 20th 2000 thatSingapore was moving to a cashless society by 2008. In anarticle \"Beginning of Endfor Cash\", the paper revealed that Singapore (aBritish-controlled Illuminati\"country\") was phasing in ”e-money\" and wouldinsist that everyone used it.Financial transactions would be made using moneystored on computer chips, itsaid, and cash will be a thing of the past as moneychanged hands electronicallyusing digital pulses transferred through mobilephones, hand-held computers andeven watches. This is just the phase before theybring in micro-chip implants foreveryone. Under the Singapore scheme, shopperswill be able to point a mobilephone at an item to register the price. The phonewould check the shopper's bankbalance on the Internet and deduct the money fromthe account if it was told to buythe item. The Singapore's government said thiswill save a small fortune on labour,security and transportation costs involvedin making and moving notes andcoins. Low Siang Kok (so have I), currencydirector at Singapore's Board ofCommissioners of Currency, said: \"The physicalnotes and coins will be a thing of346Children of the Matrixthe past. There's no point in fighting technology. If you want to give yourkidspocket money, you pass it to them by phone. They can use it for bus fares,in theschool cafeteria, or whatever.\" He then listed all the merits of thecashless societythat 1 have long predicted they would use to sell it to thepeople - safer than cashand credit cards etc. etc.Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty,said:\"Give me control of a nation's currency and 1 care not who makes the laws.”Thishas been attributed to another Rothschild also. The fewer currencies thereare, themore control you can have over the money system. This is why the Eurohas beenintroduced within the European Union and the pressure is mounting forCanada totake the US dollar. These are stepping-stones to the world currency.Under the Euro,for example, a group of unelected bankers at the European CentralBank inFrankfurt (where the Rothschild banking dynasty began) have control overtheinterest rates and financial policy for the whole of Europe. Anyone everquestionedthat? Or even bothered to find out in the first place? The next stageis to create theWorld Central Bank in which Illuminati bankers would setinterest rates andfinancial policy for every country on the planet. The worldcurrency will beelectronic because this will make control of the people so easy.At the moment ifyou hand over electronic money, a credit card, and the computerwill not accept it,you can still pay with cash. What happens when there is nocash and that computersays no to your credit card or your micro-chip, which isdesigned to replace it? Youwill have no other way of purchasing and whoeverprogrammes that computer toaccept or not accept your card or chip will controlwhat, where, and whether youpurchase anything. Also, whenever you buy a productof any kind, the place, time,item, and cost will be recorded. That's the idea,and the amount of physical moneyin circulation is already a fraction comparedwith electronic pulses on computerscreens. Even this ratio is falling all thetime.Money-tree policyOne other point on money. The Illuminati control the banks, big business,andgovernments, and, therefore, they take pretty much all the money we spend orsave.Some 80% of the cost of fuel in the UK is government taxation and the oilcompaniessay we can't blame them for the cost because they only take a smallpart of the pumpprice. Well, actually, this is not true. The Illuminati own allthe oil companies and takean enormous profit from their slice of the price. As 1was writing this book, BP-Amocoannounced it was making around £3,306 a second in profits. But, of course, itcouldnever get away with charging for itself what the governments take in tax.Sogovernment taxation allows the Illuminati to rob the population of far moremoneyand, as they control government policy through their placemen and agents,thattaxation is overwhelmingly used to advance their agenda. According toPhilSchneider, who helped to build underground bases in the United States, the\"BlackBudget\" for Illuminati projects takes 25% of the gross national product ofthe UnitedStates and (speaking in 1995) he revealed that it consumed $1.25trillion every twoyears. The same situation applies to the tax on alcohol. TheIlluminati, throughbloodline families like the Bronfmans in Canada, control liquor producersanddistributors. Liquor is also heavily taxed and the same applies here as withfuel. In theUK we have a sales tax called VAT or Value Added Tax. People buyproducts fromIlluminati businesses and pay extra in taxation for the privilege.This tax goes to thegovernment to fund the agenda. OK, don't buy so much andkeep your money in thebank. If you do, you will be giving the Illuminati theright to lend and charge intereston ten times and more what you put on deposit.Give your money to cancer researchand you will be giving it to the Illuminatidrug cartel that has no intention of findinga cure for cancer. Give it to theWorldwide Fund for Nature and you will be giving itto another Illuminati frontthat is using environmental concerns for its own ends. Hashumanity been stitchedup or what? As Henry Ford said: \"It is well enough that thepeople of the nationdo not understand our banking and monetary system, for if theydid, I believethere would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.\"\"Free trade\" is stealing the planetThe Anunnaki-Illuminati have worked ceaselessly to make all countriesdependenton the world financial and trade system, which they created andcontrol. Once againit is far more difficult for the few to dictate to the manyif the many operate ineconomic units (countries) that can decide their ownfinancial and trade policy. Sothe Illuminati first created the GATT \"free trade”agreement to stop nation statesfrom defending their economies from theimportation of goods that are destroyinglocal jobs. Their placemen in governmentsigned the agreements, which werenegotiated by Illuminati agents like Peter D.Sutherland of Ireland, the Bilderbergerhead of GATT. He later became head of theWorld Trade Organization in theIlluminati stronghold of Switzerland. Thisreplaced GATT and now has extensivepowers to impose enormous fines on nationswho do not follow its rules. By the way,Switzerland is never attacked in warsbecause that's the country through which theIlluminati finance the wars! Historyis so simple when you can see behind the veil.Sutherland was replaced at theWorld Trade Organization by the Italian, RenatoReggerio, another Bilderberger,and went on to become joint head of one of the majorIlluminati companies,British Petroleum or BP-Amoco. He took over from theprevious BP chief, Sir DavidSimon, who joined Tony Blair's government as his\"Minister for Trade andCompetitiveness in Europe\" with the brief of taking the UKinto the Euro and theUnited States of Europe. The end of trade borders in Europeunder the CommonMarket removed more control by individual countries over theireconomy, and thesame with the North American Free Trade Agreement between theUS, Canada, andMexico, negotiated by the paedophile George Bush (TC, CFR), andthat rapist ofmind-controlled women, Brian Mulroney, who was then the CanadianPrime Minister.I am sure they thought \"free\" trade was for the good of humanity.The powers ofthe World Trade Organization ensure that poor \"Third World\"countries cannot usetheir land to feed their people first, nor keep out imports thatare causinghunger and poverty by destroying local employment. If you have evertravelled inAfrica you will know that the idea that this continent cannot feed itselfisutterly ludicrous. It could feed much of the world. People are hungry because348Children of the Matrixfood-growing land is not being used to fill empty bellies, but to grow cashcrops forthe Illuminati-owned transnational corporations or to fightllluminati-engineeredwars. A book I wrote many years ago, It Doesn't Have To BeLike This, documentsexamples of this cash-crop scandal. The transnationals paylittle or no tax to thesecountries and by owning the land at the expense of thepeople, they can paypoverty wages to the workers who have no other form ofemployment and nochance of self-sufficiency. The Illuminati transnationals areleeches sucking thesecountries dry of money, opportunity, and resources. Theyare, in short, purveyors ofgenocide. But then they are owned by the Illuminatibloodlines who think nothingof sacrificing a child and drinking its blood, sowhat are they going to care about theplight of the people they abuseeconomically? The Anunnaki view humans in thesame way that most humans viewcattle.When the European countries \"withdrew\" from their colonies across the worldandgranted them \"independence\", they only did so on the surface, as 1outlinedearlier. Physical occupation by foreign armies was replaced by financialoccupationby the banks, and the plan is to go back to physical occupationthrough thetransnationals and the United Nations. The Illuminati bloodlines andsecretsocieties continued to control most of the \"independent\" African, Asian,and Southand Central American leaders. Indeed, by controlling the system, theIlluminatihave controlled them all, even the few who are not directly in theirpocket. It wasthese leaders who made the agreements to hand over thefood-growing land to thetransnationals. They told their people they would beable to import food they couldbe growing themselves with the \"money\" the countryreceived for exportingresources and commodities. But the price of thosecommodities is decided in thecommodity markets in Europe and America. With theIlluminati dictating the priceof commodities sold by \"Third World\" countries,they could bring them to theirknees whenever they chose. The puppet-leaders arerarely affected because they arewell paid for serving the dragon. Ask the massmurderer Robert Mugabe inZimbabwe. The Illuminati's greatest coup on thedeveloping nations was thecreation of \"Third World\" debt. 1 detail this story in...And The Truth Shall Set YouFree, but, briefly, the Illuminati told thedictators in the Arab oil countries that theywould vastly increase the price ofoil on the understanding that the Arabs depositthe profits from this fantasticwind fall in specified Illuminati hanks. The Arabdictators agreed. Illuminatioperatives then got together at the Bilderberg meetingin May 1973 held at aSwedish island called Saltsjoebaden, owned by theWallenberg bloodline bankingfamily. Here they agreed the details of the colossalhike in the price of oil.The next stage was to manufacture an excuse to do so and,five months later,Henry Kissinger, a Bilderberg executive, manipulated the YomKippur War betweenEgypt and Israel. In 1973 he was the US Secretary of State andNational SecurityAdvisor. Kissinger's United States and the \"West\" supported theIsraelis duringthe war with Egypt, and this gave the Arab leaders a reason toretaliateeconomically. Right on pre-arranged cue, the Arab oil dictators feignedtheirdisgust at western support for Israel and used it as an excuse to \"punish\"theWest by increasing the price of oil to levels that brought the world economyto itsknees. You know when newsreaders say that the \"OPEC\" countries are discussingtheprice of oil? Well, actually, they're not: the Illuminati are deciding the priceof oilbecause they control the OPEC leaders and all the oil companies.With these unimaginable amounts of money flowing from the Arab dictatorsinto their banks, the Illuminati threw their next card. They went to all the\"ThirdWorld\" countries and offered them enormous loans at low interest rates to\"boost\"their economies and \"industrialise\". The spin was that the Illuminati banksdidn'twant these loans repayed for reasons I will come to. They knew that themoneywould largely be wasted by their placemen and, anyway, they had insured againstrepayment by their next move. Enter Margaret Thatcher (Bil), the \"Iron Lady\",whowas, in fact, one of the most controlled and manipulated leaders of the 20thcentury.The strings around her were pulled by her foreign secretary andRothschildbloodline. Lord Carrington. He is Henry Kissinger's close associate, aformerchairman of the Bilderberg Group, and the UK foreign secretary whoengineeredthe Falklands War and handed power to the dictator Robert Mugabe in the formerRhodesia, now Zimbabwe. And these are the least of this man's crimesagainsthumanity. If that's not true. Lord Carrington, then do please sue me andlet's get thetruth about you and your mates exposed in a public court. MargaretThatcherintroduced \"her\" vicious economic policy known as \"Thatcherism\" afterherelection in 1979. Her victory was ensured by the demolition of the previousLabourGovernment caused by the Illuminati-created \"Winter of Discontent\" inwhich theyactivated their agents within the British trades union movement tocall an explosionof strikes. At one point rubbish was piled up in the streetsand even the dead couldnot be buried. (The Illuminati were also behind thesquabbles, scandals, and strifewithin the Conservative Government just beforethe election in 1995, which broughtthe Labour leader Tony Blair to power with alandslide victory.) A year afterThatcherism was launched in the UK, exactly the same policies were introducedinthe United States under the name \"Reaganomics\" with the election of the puppetpresident Ronald Reagan and his controller, the vice-president GeorgeBush.Thatcherism and Reaganomics imposed economic conditions thatbroughttremendous rises in interest rates.Now we complete the circle. The \"Third World\" countries, which acceptedthoseenormous loans at low interest rates, were now faced with such an increasein theirrepayments that they would never be able to repay the interest, letalone theprinciple. The term \"Third World debt\" was born. The cost in human miserydefiesbelief and in came those Illuminati creations, the International MonetaryFund(IMF) and the World Bank (currently headed by the Rothschild partnerandBilderberger, James Wolfensohn). They told these debt-ridden,poverty-stricken,countries that they had to cut subsidies for food and healthcare and \"restructure\"their economies in line with the instructions of the IMFand World Bank. If they didnot, they would get no further \"help\". By now thesecountries could not revert toself-sufficiency because the Illuminatitransnationals controlled much of the food-growing land and they were faced withboth world trade restrictions and debtrepayments. What happened? People starvedand are still starving, and any leader350Children of the Matrixwho seeks to challenge the Illuminati immediately finds his country involved inawar. But the Illuminati were still not finished. Why would they not wantthesecountries to repay their loans? For the same reason they don't want manypeople inthe industrial countries to repay their loans. They want their land andresources andthe control that debt ensures. Now \"debt-relief\" policies are beingimplemented inwhich these poor countries hand over rights to their land andresources forever inreturn for the \"forgiveness\" of debt. A debt that onlyexists as figures on a computerdisk. You may note that governments are\"forgiving\" Third World debt withoutdemanding a return because they are lendingtaxpayers' money. No problem,there'll be more. But the hanks are selling the\"debt\" for land and resources, in otherwords the Illuminati bloodlines are.The same technique is involved in the \"debt-for-nature-swaps” in whichpoorcountries are \"forgiven\" debt if they hand over large tracts of their landto the UnitedNations and environmental agencies to \"save the planet\". How ironicthat the greatestdestroyers of the ecology are the very policies of the IMF,World Bank, and Illuminatihanks that devastate \"Third World\" countries and forcethe people to destroy theirown environment, including the rainforests, just tosurvive. And how strange thatwhile Illuminati hanks and transnational pursuepolicies that are devastating theenvironment, it is the same Illuminatifamilies, like the Rockefellers, who finance andfront reports saying that theplanet is dying and we must \"save her”. Strange, too,that many environmentalpressure groups are Illuminati agencies, not least TheWorldwide Fund For Nature.This is headed by Prince Philip and long-timeBilderberg chairman, PrinceBernhard of The Netherlands. It was Bernhard whochaired the meeting in Swedenthat agreed to hike the price of oil with its catastrophicenvironmentalconsequences. But, in fact, none of this is strange at all. \"Savingtheenvironment\" suits the Illuminati perfectly because it involves theimposition ofcentralised global laws and the acquisition of land on a stupendousscale by theUnited Nations and other agencies of the Illuminati in the name of\"environmentalprotection\". Look at how many invading armies that cause genocidein places likeRwanda and Burundi, are sheltered in the nature and wildlife parksalong the bordersand invade through those lands. The Biggest Secret has thedetailed background.The system has been set up so that he who controls the money controls theworld,and the Illuminati bloodlines control the money. But there is so much goodnewshere, too. It means that all these so-called unsolvable problems likepoverty,debt, and war, are not a \"natural\" occurrence. They are made to happenbecause itmakes humanity easier to control and manipulate. There is enough onthis planet togive abundance to everyone, don't let them kid you otherwise. Forsome to be wellfed it is not necessary for others to go hungry. So why is thereso much povertyamid such potential abundance? By controlling the creation andflow of money, theland, and resources, the Illuminati limit choice and createdependency - on them.Their World Central Bank and currency are designed toimpose that control evenmore fiercely. Their equation is simple:Scarcity = dependency = control. Abundance = choice = freedom.351The world armyI have been writing for many years, along with other researchers, about theplanfor a World Army. In earlier books, 1 said there would eventually beanamalgamation of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and NATO, withNATO thesenior partner. 1 also wrote that we should expect more conflicts tobeengineered in which NATO was used to intervene and \"save the people\".This wouldset the precedent and change the status quo until NATO became,step-by-step, aworld police force. This process is now well under way and thewars in the Gulf,Bosnia, and Kosovo are all part of that. An organisation calledKissingerAssociates is always heavily involved in manipulating such conflicts.HenryKissinger, the Illuminati's roving manipulator, controls the company, ofcourse.One of the founding directors was his buddy, Lord Carrington, chairman oftheBilderberg Group for nearly ten years and a secretary-general of NATO. Thereisno better example of the hidden hand than the common connections betweenthemajor \"peace negotiators\" during the war in Bosnia.The peace negotiators appointed by the European Union in Bosnia were:LordCarrington (chairman of the Bilderberg Group, president of the RoyalInstitute ofInternational Affairs, Trilateral Commission member, and KissingerAssociates); hewas followed by Lord David Owen (Bil, TC); and then came theformer SwedishPrime Minister, Carl Bildt (Bil). The United Nations-appointedpeace negotiatorswere: Cyrus Vance (Bil, TC, CFR) and Thorvald Stoltenberg ofNorway (Bil, TC).Stolenberg's son became Prime Minister of Norway. When theyfailed to achievepeace, along came an \"independent peace negotiator\", JimmyCarter (first TrilateralCommission President of the United States and Council onForeign Relationsmember). By now the public and political clamour for \"somethingmust be done\"had been focused by the horrendous television pictures coming outof Bosnia, andthe Illuminati could play their sting in this classicproblem-reaction-solutionscenario. Along came Bill Clinton's special envoy,Richard Holbrooke (Bil, TC, CFR)to negotiate the Dayton Agreement that installeda 60,000-strong NATO world armyin Bosnia. This was the biggest multi-nationalforce assembled since the SecondWorld War. Holbrooke answered to US Secretary ofState Warren Christopher (TC,CFR) and Defence Secretary William Perry (Bil).Their boss, at least officially, wasPresident Bill Clinton (Bil, TC, CFR). Thefirst head of the NATO world army inBosnia was Admiral Leighton Smith (CFR) andthe head of the civilian operationwas Carl Bildt (Bil). The media won't tell youany of this because most journaliststhink investigative reporting is reading themorning papers and the official pressreleases. And the Illuminati control thenewspapers through subordinates like the\"owner\" of the Washington Post,Katherine Graham (Bil, TC, CFR) and theCanadian, Conrad Black, an inner-coremember of the Bilderberg Group, who headsthe Hollinger media empire. Thisincludes the London Daily Telegraph, the JerusalemPost, and has owned some 70%of newspapers in Canada. Members of theseorganisations control all threetelevision networks in the United States, NBC, ABC,and CBS. They also controlthe Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Wall StreetJournal, and the empires ofRupert Murdoch, Time-Warner, including CNN, and themajor352Children of the Matrixmedia operations throughout the world. Even four out of five local newspapersinthe UK are now owned by the big media cartels.The main aim of the Bosnian war was to advance the NATO role of worldpoliceforce. When the conflict began the UN peacekeepers were always sent tosuchtrouble spots. But the Illuminati wanted to change that and while thoseterriblepictures of death and suffering were bombarding the public mind aroundthe world,a media campaign was waged to condemn the UN operation in Bosnia asineffectiveand next to useless. This was the excuse to bring in NATO forces andin doing so theIlluminati agenda moved forward significantly. When the Kosovoconflict wasmanipulated, there was no talk of sending UN soldiers because thestatus quo hadbeen flipped by what happened in Bosnia. From the start the worldlooked to NATOto intervene in Kosovo and, as a result of their grotesque bombingcampaign, theyextended their control of that region. People have said to me thatthey could notunderstand the need for a world army because there would be no oneto fight! Yesthere would - the people. The world government would control theworld army. Itsjob would be to implement the laws and decisions of the worldgovernment, shouldany country rebel and refuse to comply. We are talking globalfascism here and thestructures are being introduced before our eyes to imposethat. The Illuminati knowthere is a chance that if US troops were asked to abuseand murder US citizens thatmany would rebel and perhaps mutiny. So they arecovertly locating foreign troopsin the United States under the guise of theUnited Nations while sending vastnumbers of American troops abroad. The samewith other countries, too.The mental, emotional, and physicial onslaughtIf you want to control a population you must suppress their desire or abilitytothink for themselves and see what is going on around them. This is donethroughthe manipulation of the mind and emotions, and with drugs, vaccines, andfoodadditives. It is vital that we realise that those who control the drugcompanies arethe same as those who control the food giants - and the \"healthagencies\", media,governments, banks, corporations, and all the rest. Millions ofpeople are dyingevery year of diseases like cancer and AIDS who could bereturned to health if theywere allowed to choose from all the treatmentsavailable and not be confined to theprimitive scalpel and drug. I have sat intreatment rooms, for example, andwatched people cured, sometimes in 15 minutes,of complaints for which theirdoctors have either offered major and expensivesurgery or no hope at all. Thisincludes a woman who was so ill with lung cancershe had to be driven to thetreatment centre because she did not have thestrength to drive a car. After onetreatment she was driving herself. Eventually,as her treatment and improvementcontinued, she went back to the doctors, who hadsaid there was nothing theycould do. Their new tests showed that she was cancerfree. This \"treatment” is nomiracle because there are no miracles, only thenatural laws and forces of creationat work. It is our knowledge of how toharness these forces that has beensuppressed and people ignorantly follow whatthe \"experts\" tell them is possible.One healer I know used to be a conventionalsurgeon until he saw the truth of353what was going on and how knowledge was being kept from us all. Thisincludesdoctors. The Illuminati has structured the training of the medicalprofession to turnout people who advance their version of \"truth\". You only passyour medicalexams if you conform to this official \"truth\" and you only keep yourjob if youcontinue to do so throughout your career. It is the same withscientists, teachers,government officials, the whole lot.The manipulation of medicineThere is far more to the human entity than a physical body. That is the least ofwhatwe are. It is the genetic spacesuit through which our eternal consciousness,thethinking, feeling us experiences this frequency range we call the physicalworld.The brain is the computer, the switching station, which connects ourimmortal mindto our mortal body. We don't think from the brain, we think throughthe brain.People with brain damage do not have damaged minds; they have adamagedcomputer, which cannot transmit the messages of the mind to the physicallevel ofexperience. The mind is an energy field working through the brain, notthe brainitself. Our emotions are another energy field and these differentlevels of being areconnected through a series of vortexes known as \"chakras\", aSanskrit wordmeaning \"wheels of light\". In this way, stress in our emotionalenergy field, whichmanifests as an imbalanced vibration, is passed down thelevels through thechakras. What is the first thing that happens when we getstressed and emotional?We stop thinking straight. This is the imbalancedemotional vibration disrupting theclarity and balance of the mental energyfield. If the stress is serious enough, andgoes on for long enough, theimbalanced vibration begins to affect the physicalbody. This vibrationalimbalance interacts with the body cells to cause chemicalchanges and this iswhat we call \"disease\", or dis-ease as it really is. It is only at thispointthat the medical profession gets interested, when the vibrationalimbalanceaffects the physical. They either prescribe a drug to try to reversethe chemicalchanges or take the person for surgery to cut away the result of thechemicalchanges. This is what we call \"advanced\" medicine! They treat thesymptom andnot the cause because they do not understand what the human entityreally is. Theysee, and therefore treat, only the physical body. That is whatthe Illuminati systemtrains them to do and insists they do not deviate from.True healers treat and remove the energy imbalances that are causing thephysicaleffect. They do this by using their own bodies to \"channel\" energy fromtheinfinite supply all around them through their hands to the patient. Therearemany other forms of vibrational and energy healing, also. Acupunctureneedlesbalance the energy flows around the body, while crystal therapy andhomeopathyare using the vibrations of crystals and plants to balance thepatient's energy field.Of course there are charlatans in these alternativemethods, too, but on nowherenear the scale of those in the drug cartels andmedical authorities. When the cause isremoved, its physical consequencesdisappear and this is reported as a \"miraclecure\", but, like I say, it isnothing of the kind. I have experienced some of these\"miracles\" myself. Thephysical body has an energy blueprint known to healers as354Children of the Matrixthe \"etheric body\" and when this is damaged or imbalanced it manifests asphysicaldis-ease. You might imagine the etheric body standing by a pool and itsreflection inthe water as the physical body. When the etheric changes its stateor form in anyway, the same happens to the physical. So if you keep the ethericlevel in goodshape, the physical will do the same. While I was writing thisbook, I bashed my toeand after ten days it was getting worse, not better. It wasextremely painful to walk.A healer did some \"hands on\" healing, channellingenergy to repair the damage tothe etheric level. Within half an hour my toe wasfeeling better and within two daysit was back to normal.I have met healers who have worked on some famous people in the Far Eastandthese are the healing methods the Illuminati use. They don't want us to knowaboutsuch treatments and so they ridicule them, call them \"quackery\", or condemnthemas evil, while secretly using them for their own benefit. Most of the\"quackery\" goeson every day in the official hospitals and doctors' surgeries andthe evil is in thebillions of people who suffer and die when they could be curedif these suppressedhealing methods were in widespread use. This is not tocondemn all doctors, onlythe system which imprisons them. Why do you think somany of the mostprominent Illuminati like David Rockefeller and Henry Kissingerare able to jetaround the world like 40 year olds when they are both in their70s? By using thedrugs that the Rockefeller pharmaceutical empire turns out forthe rest of us? Youmust be joking. These people know they are causing the deathand suffering ofbillions by their actions, but they don't give a shit, just asmost humans don't give ashit about the plight of cattle. Their \"medicine\" is notdesigned to make us well inthe true sense. Its prime aim is to suppress and dimour thinking processes, andmake us subservient to authority. It's like sedatinga cow or a sheep so they can becontrolled more easily and won’t run away whenthey see the slaughterhouse. Mostof the medical profession have no idea this isso. They are just the fodder. They haveto use the methods dictated from above ifthey wish to keep their jobs. WhenGuylaine Lanctot, a wonderful lady andprofessional doctor in Canada, began toexpose the manipulation of the drugcartel and its agents in medical administration,she was struck off. See herexcellent book. The Medical Mafia (Here's The Key, Inc,Canada, 1995), availablethrough Bridge of Love and my website. She also showswhy the suppressed andridiculed \"alternatives\" are more effective than thetreatments she was trainedto administer. We are multi-dimensional beings andexist on all frequencies anddimensions of creation. We can access the infinite oceanof consciousness or stayimprisoned in our little droplet, disconnected from the trueenormity of who andwhat we are. If you were the Anunnaki-Illuminati wherewould you want humanity tobe - stuck in the droplet or sailing on the ocean? Oneway they do this is byfeeding us drugs and chemicals that suppress brain function,clarity of thought,and the ability to connect powerfully with our higher levels ofbeing, or \"sixthsense\" of psychic awareness and intuition. This is the real reasonbehind all thedrugs, vaccines, and food additives we daily consume. 1 will give yousomeexamples of this war on the human brain and immune system, but really thelist issimply endless.355Aspartame1One of the weapons is aspartame, an Illuminati creation that suppressestheintellect. It is now used in thousands of foodstuffs and almost every softdrink. Andwho are the biggest consumers of soft drinks? Children. They want toget the kidsas early as possible and turn them into unthinking, unquestioning,clones for life.Aspartame is an \"artificial sweetener\" and marketed as analternative to thenegative effects of sugar - which the Illuminati also control!It is known under tradenames like NutraSweet, Equal, and Spoonful. Aspartame,which is 200 timessweeter than sugar, was introduced in 1981 and has been thesubject of 75% of thecomplaints reported to the Adverse Reaction Monitoringsystem of the US Foodand Drug Administration (FDA). These complaints haveincluded headaches,dizziness, attention difficulties, memory loss, slurredspeech, and vision problems.Such symptoms are now known as \"aspartame disease\",just as the affects of thepreservative Monosodium Glutamate are called theGlutamate Syndrome. John W.Olney, MD of the Washington University Medical Schoolin St Fouis, believes theremay be a link between aspartame and brain tumours. Inan article published in theJournal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology,he says that animalstudies reveal high levels of brain tumours in aspartame-fedrats. Dr Olney addsthat aspartame has mutagenic (cancer-causing) potentialaccording to studies, and asharp rise in malignant brain tumours coincides withthe increased use ofaspartame. Even the US Navy and Air Force published articlesin Navy Physiologyand Flying Safety warning that:\"Several researchers have found aspartame can increase the frequency ofseizures,or lower the stimulation necessary to induce them. This means a pilotwho drinks dietsodas is more susceptible to flicker vertigo, or toflicker-induced epileptic activity. Italso means that all pilots are potentialvictims of sudden memory loss, dizzinessduring instrument flight, and gradualloss of vision.\"2And aspartame is no longer confined to diet drinks. It changes brainchemistryand lowers the threshold for seizures, causes mood disorders and otherproblems ofthe nervous system. It is also addictive. Hence people often find itdifficult to stopconsuming the soft drinks that contain aspartame. Symptoms ofmultiple sclerosis,chronic fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, depression and othermood disorders havevanished in many patients after they stopped aspartameconsumption. Ten per centof this legalised poison breaks down after ingestioninto methanol, a nervous systemtoxin also known as free methyl alcohol or woodalcohol. This is extremely harmfulto the optic nerve. It is the main ingredientof \"moonshine\" liquor made duringProhibition and this was notorious for causingblindness. Methanol is rapidlyreleased into the bloodstream, where it can becomethe neurotoxin and cancer-causing formaldehyde and formic acid, the poison inant stings. Fancy a soda?The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in America, like its equivalent inothercountries, is an Illuminati front to block products that are good forhumanityand to push through, without proper testing, those that suit the agenda.This356Children of the Matrixhappened with aspartame. First the FDA approved its use on the basis ofridiculousdata and then had to withdraw that permission in the face of studiesshowing that itcaused seizures and brain tumours in animals. But the FDArestored approval in1981, despite the unanimous opposition of a Public Board ofInquiry, which hadreviewed the scientific data and recommended a delay. Dr RalphG. Walton, aProfessor of Psychiatry at North Eastern Ohio University College ofMedicine,reviewed all the studies on aspartame and found 166 with relevance forhumansafety. All of the 74 studies funded by the aspartame industry gave it theall clear,but 92% of those independently funded revealed safety problems. Whichoneswould you believe?The reason this poison was approved against all the evidence is simplecorruption. A commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, anactingcommissioner, six other operatives, and two attorneys assigned toprosecuteNutraSweet for submitting fraudulent tests, left the organisation towork for...NutraSweet, a trade name for aspartame. One genuine scientist workingfor the FDAwrote to a US senator: \"It's like a script for Abbott and Costello.It works like this:'Approve our poison, and when you stop being a bureaucratwe'll make you aplutocrat! After it's licensed we'll pay off the AmericanDietetics, the AmericanDiabetes Association, the American Medical Association and anyone we needwho'sfor sale'.\" Coca-Cola knew of the dangers of aspartame because, as a memberof theNational Soft Drink Association, it opposed the approval by the Food andDrugAdministration. Its objections were published in the Congressional Record ofJuly5th, 1985. It said that aspartame was inherently unstable and breaks down in thecan,decomposing into formaldehyde, methyl alcohol, formic acid, diketopiperazineandother toxins. So what is aspartame now doing in Diet Coke, the sales of whichsoaredwhen it was added because it is so addictive? And \"Diet\" Coke is not\"diet\" at all.People who drink it get fatter, as with all aspartame products,because it increasesthe craving for carbohydrates by suppressing the productionof seratonin. We areliving amid a gigantic confidence trick. By the way, theMonsanto Corporation of StLouis, Missouri, owned NutraSweet and anotheraspartame product. Equal. This isan Illuminati company to its fingertips and thepromoter of genetically modifiedfood, another part of the Illuminati assault onthe human mind and body. It is usingthe same methods to win approval forgenetically modified food as it did foraspartame. Members of the Working Groupon Bio-Safety connected to theConvention on Biological Diversity in Cartagena,Colombia, make recommendationson the use of genetically modified food. Themembers include:Linda J. Fisher, Vice President of Government and Public Affairs for Monsantoandformerly with the US Environmental Protection Agency; Dr. Michael A.Friedman,Senior Vice-President for Clinical Affairs at G.D. Searle & Co., apharmaceuticaldivision of Monsanto, formerly with the US Food and DrugAdministration; MarciaHale, Director of International Government Affairs forMonsanto, formerlyassistant to the President of the United States; Michael(Mickey) Kantor,director of Monsanto, former Secretary of the US Departmentof Commerce; Josh King, director of global communication in the Washington,DCoffice of Monsanto, former director of production for White House events;WilliamD. Ruckelshaus, director of Monsanto, former chief administrator of theUnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency; Michael Taylor, head of theWashington,DC office of Monsanto Corporation, former legal advisor to theFood and DrugAdministration; Lidia Watrud, former microbial biotechnologyresearcher atMonsanto, now with the United States Environmental ProtectionAgency'sEnvironmental Effects Laboratory; Jack Watson, staff lawyer withMonsanto inWashington, former chief of staff to the President of the UnitedStates, JimmyCarter. Others include representatives from Dupont (majorIlluminati bloodline)and Dow Chemicals (Illuminati). Their representative isClayton K. Yeutter,former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,former US TradeRepresentative, who led the US team in negotiating the US-Canada Free TradeAgreement and helped to launch the Uruguay Round of theGATT negotiations. He isnow a director of Mycogen Corporation, whosemajority owner is Dow Agro-Sciences,a wholly owned subsidiary of the DowChemical Company. 1 am sure theirrecommendations will be devoid of any biaswhatsoever, or my name isn't CharlieShufflebottom.Prozac3The story of Prozac, produced by the George Bush drug company, Eli Lilly, isthesame tale of Illuminati corruption to impose a mind suppressant onthepopulation. In 1982, David Dunner of the University of Washington begantoaccept more than $1.4 million from Lilly for research and seminars. Some ofthis\"research\" was for conducting a clinical trial with 100 people for Prozac.At thesame time he was a member of the Food and DrugAdministration'sPsychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, responsible forreviewing newdrug applications for the FDA. Dunner was asked if he had anyconflict of interestwith Eli Lilly when he began to assess Prozac for the FDA,but he replied: \"Nopending commitments at the present time.” The FDA acceptedthis and yet Dunnerhad already given five seminars sponsored by Prozac producerEli Lilly before thisdate. The seminars were about \"depressive disorders\"- thetarget market forProzac. Dunner also failed to disclose that he had agreed totwo further seminarsfor Lilly arranged to take place after Prozac was approved.According to the publicrecord, Lilly's test on Prozac showed it was little moreeffective than a uselessplacebo and an FDA statistician suggested to Lilly thatthe test results be evaluateddifferently to indicate a more favourable result.This they did. An FDA safetyreview established that Lilly failed to reportpsychotic episodes during Prozac'stesting, but there was no reprimand. By 1987,two months before the FDAapproved Prozac, 27 people had died in controlledclinical trials. 15 were suicides,six by overdose, four by gunshot and two bydrowning. Prozac was directlyconnected to all of them. Twelve other people inthe trials died, but the cause wasnot directly related to Prozac. In 1991 theFDA executive, Paul Leber, said he noted358Children of the Matrix\"the large number of reports of all kinds on Prozac\" (more than 15,000). ButLeberpressured personnel in charge of the agency's adverse reporting systemtodiscount these reports as \"of limited value\". The number had reached 28,600by1992 with another 1,700 deaths. Yet the Commissioner of the FDA, DavidKessler,has said that: \"Although the FDA receives many adverse event reports,theseprobably represent only a fraction of the serious adverse eventsencountered byproviders. Only about one percent of the serious events arereported to the FDA,according to one study\" On that basis there were reallyaround 2,860,000 adversereactions to Prozac by 1992 alone. What will it be bynow? The number is almostunimaginable. But they are introducing a form of Prozacfor children and it iswidely used among victims of mind control. 1 understandthat Thomas Flamilton,the killer of the children at Dunblane in Scotland, wastaking Prozac, and EricHarris, one of the teenagers in the Columbine High Schoolshooting, was reportedto be taking the drug Luvox, which is given the sameclassification as Prozac. Themain active ingredient in Prozac was found in theblood of Henry Paul, the driverof the car when Princess Diana was murdered.Prozac is just one of a long list ofdrugs designed to have the same effect.RitalinRitalin is another mind-altering drug that is targeted at children and canseriouslyaffect their behaviour. It has been connected to many acts of violence.A 1995report by the Drug Enforcement Agency warned that Ritalin \"shares many ofthepharmacological effects of... cocaine\". In fact, the US government classifiesRitalinin the same category as cocaine and heroin. Dennis H. Clarke, thechairman of theExecutive Advisory Board, Citizens Commission On Human RightsInternational,said: \"The use of Ritalin on children has no purpose other than toslow them down,shut them up, and make it more difficult for them to movearound.” He says it isan easy way out for parents and teachers to give them adrug. Clarke highlights thefindings of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, ThirdRevised Edition, published by the American PsychiatricAssociation. He says thissupports his claims of the dangers of Ritalin forchildren. He says that all thecritical information about Ritalin has beenremoved in the more recent edition andthis confirms, he says, that the industryis involved in a cover-up. The industrysays the removal was simply \"an error\".Clarke suggests that children who takeRitalin in elementary school are oftenswitched to Prozac and other drugs as theyget older. The effects of Ritalin cancontinue long after the prescription is stopped,Clarke warns. Dr Ann BlakeTracy, Director of the International Coalition for DrugAwareness, supports thisview. She points out that adults who use these drugs arefar more likely tocommit violent crimes. Dr Tracy comes from Utah, home of theMormon Church, wherethe use of Ritalin and Prozac is reported to be three timesgreater than the restof the country per head of population. She said Utah's rateof murders andsuicides has increased by a similar amount.4 Dennis H. Clarkesays that the highnumber of incidents involving violent children and the increasein child suicide,can be attributed to an ever-increasing number of children who are359given drugs to control their behaviour. Clarke gave an example of ayoungsterinvolved in the Jonesboro killings in Arkansas:\"We do know, for example, that the 13-year-old in Jonesboro was beingtreated.Apparently they were saying he had been sexually abused as a child. Theywere sayinghe was now a sexual abuser. He had a hyperactivity type label put onhim as well - or'attention deficit disorder.' So we had several different thingsworking with him. Thereis no chance under the Sun, Moon, or stars that this kidwas not on drugs.\"5Clarke says that when a violent event happens, the pharmaceutical \"crashteams\"go to work to keep things quiet. Teams of psychiatrists are sent to thelocationsand quickly ensure that medical records are kept sealed, doctors areconvinced tokeep quiet, and victims are bought off to stop the case going to court.\"It's allbeing covered up, and it's deliberate. There are billions and billions ofdollarsat stake here,\" he said. David M. Bresnahan, a contributing editorforWorldNetDaily.com says he was told by an elementary school teacher in Utahthatshe routinely makes recommendations for children in her classes to begivenRitalin.\" She said 11 of the 29 children in her first-grade class are nowtaking thedrug in school each day. Dennis Clarke predicts that the future willsee even moreviolent children, unless the connection between Ritalin and violentacts is openlyaccepted. Clarke says that the general public, health officials,and parents are notrecognising the extent of a pandemic that is already sweepingthe nation. Even theC1BA Pharmaceutical Company says in a product informationrelease:\"Warning; sufficient data on the safety and efficacy of long-term use of Ritalininchildren are not yet available.\"7Unbelievable. They are handing out Ritalin like sweets to ever gatheringnumbersof children and they admit they have no idea of the long-term effects!Thiswarning is only there to head off lawsuits later when the long and shorttermeffects are accepted. Herbert S. Okun, a member of the International DrugControlBoard for the United Nations, told a news conference that his board isveryconcerned that methylphenidate (Ritalin) is massively over prescribed intheUnited States. He said there are 330 million doses of Ritalin taken each dayin theUS, compared with 65 million for the rest of the world. Our children arebeingsystematically drugged and the teachers and parents are watching it happen,oftenencouraging it. The main targets are the kids with active minds and thosewho actdifferently to the norm.Fluoride. Come on, drink upFluoride is another major intellect suppressant that is being added todrinkingwater supplies and toothpaste. Sodium fluoride is a common ingredient inrat andcockroach poisons, anaesthetics, hypnotics, psychiatric drugs, andmilitary nervegas. It is one of the basic ingredients in Prozac and the Sarinnerve gas used in the360Children of the Matrixattack in the Japanese subway system. Independent scientific evidence hasclaimedthat fluoride causes various mental disturbances and makes people stupid,docile,and subservient. This is besides shortening life spans and damaging bonestructure.The first use of fluoridated drinking water was in the Nazi prisoncamps inGermany, thanks to the Illuminati's notorious pharmaceutical giant, I.G.Farben.This was the company that ran camps like Auschwitz and it still exists asitsconstituent parts like Bayer. Does anyone think the Nazis did this becausetheywere concerned for the teeth of the inmates? This mass medication ofwatersupplies with sodium fluoride was to sterilise the prisoners and force themintoquiet submission. Charles Perkins, a chemist, wrote the following to theLeeFoundation for Nutritional Research, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on October 2nd1954:\"...In the 1930's, Hitler and the German Nazis envisioned a world to bedominatedand controlled by a Nazi philosophy of pan-Germanism. The Germanchemists workedout a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass-control, whichwas submitted toand adopted by the German General Staff. This plan was tocontrol the population inany given area through mass medication of drinkingwater supplies. By this methodthey could control the population in whole areas,reduce population by watermedication that would produce sterility in women, andso on. In this scheme of mass-control, sodium fluoride occupied a prominentplace.\"8Charles Perkins said that repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoridewillin time reduce an individual’s power to resist domination, by slowlypoisoning and\"narcotising\" a certain area of the brain, thus making himsubmissive to the will ofthose who wish to govern him. He called it a\"convenient light lobotomy\". The realreason behind water fluoridation is not tobenefit children's teeth, he said. If thiswas the real reason there are manyways in which it could be done that are mucheasier, cheaper, and far moreeffective, he points out. The real purpose behind waterfluoridation was toreduce the resistance of the masses to domination and controland loss ofliberty. Perkins said that when the Nazis under Hitler decided to go intoPoland,both the German General Staff and the Russian General Staff exchangedscientificand military ideas, plans, and personnel, and the scheme of mass controlthroughwater medication was seized upon by the Russian Communists because itfittedideally into their plan to \"communise\" the world:\"I was told of this entire scheme by a German chemist who was an official ofthegreat I.G. Farben chemical industries and was also prominent in the Nazimovementat the time. I say this with all the earnestness and sincerity of ascientist who hasspent nearly 20 years' research into the chemistry,biochemistry, physiology andpathology of fluorine - any person who drinksartificially-fluorinated water for a periodof one year or more will never againbe the same person mentally or physically.\"9That is the very reason the Illuminati has been expanding the consumptionoffluoride ever since and what better way to suppress the minds of thepopulation361than through the public drinking water supplies? When we drink anything madefromfluoridated water, including beer and soft drinks, we are being slowlyandconsistently drugged. Fluoride is a by-product of the aluminium industry andthescam to add it to public drinking water came from the Mellon family in theUnitedStates, which controls the aluminium cartel called ALCOA. The Mellons arebig-time bloodline, close friends of the British royal family, and dictators ofUS policythrough the Illuminati network. Industrial fluorines are majorpolluters of riversand streams, poisoning land, fish, and animals. It wascosting the aluminiumindustry a fortune to deal with them, but the Mellon familymanipulated a situationin which this poisonous waste product became an enormoussource of income andhuman control. In 1944, Oscar Ewing was employed by ALCOA atan annual salaryof $750,000. Imagine what that would be today! But within monthshe left tobecome head of the US Government's Federal Security Agency and beganacampaign to add sodium fluoride to public drinking water. The Mellons now sellitfor use in drinking water and toothpaste at a 20,000% mark-up. Fluoride goesintodrinking water at approximately one part-per-million, but we only drink 1/2of onepercent of the water supply. The rest goes down the drain as a freehazardous-wastedisposal for the chemical industry. And we pay for that. But themain reason, asalways, is not money. It is control. A former mind controllerwith the Illuminati toldme of the Mellons' deep involvement with the Illuminatiand Satanism. She saidthat to her knowledge the Mellon National Bank inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania is anIlluminati operation that launders money for them.Would you trust such a familyto put chemicals in drinking water and toothpastebecause they want to keep yourteeth healthy? Not that fluoride does.We have a Member of Parliament here on the Isle of Wight where I live inEnglandcalled Peter Brand, who is pressing for fluoride to be added to ourdrinkingwater because it is \"good for children's teeth\". This man is aprofessionaldoctor and the \"health\" spokesman for the Liberal Democratic Party.In fact, hedoesn't know his arse from his elbow and provides yet another exampleof howdoctors are so deeply uninformed. But because they are doctors, manypeoplethink that they must know it all. Dr Hardy Limeback, BSc, PhD inBiochemistry,head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry for the Universityof Toronto, andpresident of the Canadian Association for Dental Research, wasonce Canada'sleading promoter of fluoride in water supplies. But then suddenlyhe announcedhe had changed his mind. He said: \"Children under three should neverusefluoridated toothpaste or drink fluoridated water. And baby formula mustneverbe made up using Toronto tap water. Never.\"10 A study at the UniversityofToronto revealed that people in cities that fluoridate their water have doublethefluoride in their hip bones compared with non-fluoridated areas, andtheydiscovered that flouride was changing the \"basic architecture of humanbones\".There is a debilitating condition called skeletal fluorosis caused bytheaccumulation of fluoride in the bones, making them weak and brittle. Theearliestsymptoms are mottled and brittle teeth, and Dr Limeback said that inCanada theywere spending more money treating dental fluorosis than treatingcavities. But362Children of the Matrixhold on. At least putting this poison in the water and toothpaste is keepingteethhealthy and preventing cavities, yes? Er...no.As Limeback points out, they have been putting fluoride in the Torontodrinkingwater for 36 years while Vancouver has never been fluoridated. Get this:thepopulation of Vancouver has lower cavity rates than Toronto! He said thatcavityrates are low all across the industrialised world - including Europe,which is so far98% fluoride free. This was due, he said, to improved standardsof living, lessrefined sugar, regular dental check-ups, flossing and frequentbrushing. There werenow fewer than two cavities per child in Canada. He saidthat those who continueto promote fluoride are working with data that is 50years old and questionable atbest. \"The dentists have absolutely no training intoxicity,\" he said. \"Your well-intentioned dentist is simply following 50 yearsof misinformation from publichealth and the dental association. Me, too.Unfortunately, we were wrong.” And notonly are we drinking the poisonous sodiumfluoride, we are getting all the othercrap from the aluminium industry, too.Limeback said:\"But certainly the crowning blow was the realization that we have beendumpingcontaminated fluoride into water reservoirs for half a century. The vastmajority of allfluoride additives come from Tampa Bay, Florida, smokestackscrubbers. Theadditives are a toxic by-product of the super-phosphate fertilizerindustry.\"Tragically, that means we're not just dumping toxic fluoride into our drinkingwater.We're also exposing innocent, unsuspecting people to deadly elements oflead,arsenic and radium, all of them carcinogenic. Because of the cumulativeproperties oftoxins, the detrimental effects on human health arecatastrophic.\"11Alzheimer's disease has been linked to aluminium and to aspartame. In anaddressto students at the University of Toronto Department of Dentistry, DrLimebacktold them that he had unintentionally mis-led his colleagues andstudents. Forthe past 15 years, he had refused to study the toxicology informationthat isreadily available to anyone. \"Poisoning our children was the furthest thingfrommy mind,\" he said. \"The truth was a bitter pill to swallow, but swallow itIdid.\" Yet even though the biggest supporter of fluoride has now condemned itsuse,the Illuminati-controlled Canadian and American Dental Associations andpublic\"health\" agencies, together with those in the UK and worldwide, continueto tellthe people that fluoridation is good for them. This is just one exampleof \"the biggerthe lie, the more will believe it\". Illuminati placemen in thepositions of medicaladministration and \"scientific research\" tell the doctorsand dentists what is \"truth\"and what they should believe. They tell this totheir patients and the media, whosimply take the official line and repeat itlike parrots. Because hardly anyone doesany research of their own, dentists,doctors, \"journalists\", or public, it becomes anaccepted \"fact\" that fluoride indrinking water and toothpaste is good for teeth andnot harmful. That samescenario is repeated in relation to every subject every dayand, as a result, thehuman population lives in its own little fairyland. This363manufactured illusion is so entrenched in the human psyche that when thetruthdoes come out, most people laugh in its face. There need to be massiveclass actionlawsuits against the authorities by those who have already had theirhealthdevastated by fluoride, Prozac, and aspartame. This is already happeninginCanada over the use of mercury, another poison and intellect suppressant, intoothfillings. And there you have that phrase again which is constantly repeatedwhenthe adverse effects of drugs, food additives, and other chemicals in ourdiet arelisted: intellect suppressant. With the truth about fluoride now beingmore widelycirculated, suddenly \"new research\" has conveniently revealed that itis good forstopping brittle bones and reduces the risks of fractures. This hasbeen used toapply yet more pressure for the expansion of fluoride in drinkingwater. Fluoride isnot there to protect teeth. That's just an excuse. It is thereto suppress the intellect ofthe population so they don't think, question, orrebel.Vaccinations12It is the same story with vaccines. This is a highly efficient way of pumpingmind-suppressing drugs and immune system destroyers into billions of peoplewhile theythink you are trying to help them. Whole generations of childrenworldwide arecontaminated in this way every year while the figures show that theclaims madefor the benefits of vaccination are utter baloney. Dr GuylaineLanctot exposes thereality of vaccinations in her book, The Medical Mafia. Shesays that repeatedvaccination exhausts the immune system and opens people to allsorts of diseasesthe body's defences would normally repel. As so many studieshave shown, thediseases the vaccines were supposed to protect us against were infree-fall before thevaccine was introduced. Ian Sinclair, an Australianresearcher, has documented thelies behind vaccination in a series of books andarticles, including Health: The OnlyImmunity.13 He says that he discovered thefollowing.• Graphical and statistical evidence showing that more than 90% of the declineindeath rates from infectious disease occurred before vaccination commenced.Allmedical journals acknowledged this decline was caused by improvedsanitation,hygiene, better nutrition, and living standards. In other words,vaccination wasnot responsible for wiping out infectious disease as medicalauthorities claim.• A tuberculosis vaccine trial in India involving more than 260,000Indiansresulted in more cases of TB among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.Butthis vaccine is still being given to Australian children and others aroundtheworld.• The cost of the whooping cough vaccine leaped from 11 cents in 1982 to $11.40in1987 because of the $8.00 a shot the company was putting aside to pay forlegaland damages costs for the brain-damaged and dead victims of the vaccine.• Millions of children in \"Third World\" countries were still dying frommeasles,tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio etc., despite being fullyvaccinated.The consequences of vaccines for health, both short and long term, areappalling.But they serve the Illuminati perfectly in both the health and mentaleffects for the364Children of the Matrixpopulation they wish to control and the profits they accumulate. Again,thinkpyramid. Those at the top, the Anunnaki bloodlines, created and control theWorldHealth Organization at the United Nations. This supports in its statementstheagenda of the Illuminati and their drug companies. The World HealthOrganizationannounces there is going to be an epidemic of something or other andthe Illuminatiagents in government start a mass vaccination against this alleged\"danger\" via themedical profession. The Illuminati drug companies then sell themthe vaccines. Thishappened with measles vaccinations in the UK in the 1990s. Themass vaccinationprogrammes in the \"Third World\" are funded and administeredthrough theIlluminati's World Bank, World Heath Organization, and other UNagencies. Thisallows them to target certain peoples in their campaign ofgenocide. Dr Lanctotwrites in The Medical Mafia:\"Vaccination decimates populations. Drastically in Third World countries.Chronicallyin industrialized countries. In this regard, Robert McNamara [Bil,TC, CFR], theformer President of the World Bank, former Secretary of State inthe United States,who ordered massive bombing of Vietnam, and a member of theExpanded Programon Immunization, made some very interesting remarks. As reportedby a Frenchpublication, j\"ai tout compris', he was quoted as stating: 'One musttake draconianmeasures of demographic reduction against the will of thepopulations. Reducingthe birth rate has proved to be impossible or insufficient.One must thereforeincrease the mortality rate. Flow? By natural means. Famineand sickness(translation from French).'\"14’\"Draconian methods\" = methods employed by the Draco. Dr Lanctot saysthatvaccination enables the selected populations to be decimated. It allows\"targetedgenocide\" and permits the killing of people from a certain race, group,or country,while leaving others untouched. All can be done in the name of healthand wellbeing, she says. Diseases have been dispersed among \"Third World\"populationsthrough vaccination and water supplies. Dr Gotlieb, a cancerologist,told a hearinginvestigating the CIA that he dispersed a large quantity ofviruses into the CongoRiver in Zaire in 1960 to contaminate the water used fordrinking by local people.Dr Gotlieb went on to become head of the NationalCancer Institute to further hiscampaign to \"fight disease\". Cancer researchorganisations, to which people givemillions of pounds through charityfundraising worldwide, are more Illuminatifronts to stop the discovery of a curethose on the inside already know exists. If yougive money to them, you aregiving it to the Illuminati, although the genuinepeople shaking their collectiontins in the street are not aware of this.The AIDS scam15AIDS is another of the diseases causing untold misery and suffering, whichtheIlluminati artificially introduced through vaccination. The biggestsmokescreen tothis is the claim that HIV causes AIDS. Doctors, media, and publicaccept this asunquestioned truth. Nonsense. The fact that large numbers of AIDSvictims are not365HIV-positive is proof alone that all AIDS cases are not HIV related. HIV isactually aweak virus and it has been labelled the all-encompassing villain tohide the realcauses of shattered immune systems. What a coincidence that \"wonderdrugs\" totreat people with HIV, like the Rockefeller cartel's infamous AZT, havea rathersignificant side effect: they destroy...the immune system! No, it'strue. AZT was achemotherapy drug for cancer and was found to be so toxic it hadto be withdrawn.When you see the effects of chemotherapy drugs that are still inuse, how toxic mustAZT really be? Chemotherapy drugs have a simple role. Theykill cells. Not justcancer cells. All cells. The question is will they kill allthe cancer cells before theykill enough healthy cells to kill the patient? Thisis why chemotherapy patients getso ill and even if the cancer is eliminated theyhave a permanently damagedimmune system because the drug also kills the whitecells that protect us againstdisease. When Illuminati agents whipped up theanger of homosexuals to demandthat a treatment be found for HIV, a Rockefellercompany took AZT back off theshelf as a \"wonder drug\". Its \"wonder\" was that itincreased the creation of whiteblood cells, the body's immune system that HIV issupposed to destroy. What theydidn't tell you was that this initial increase inwhite cells was because AZT was sopoisonous, the body's defence mechanism jumpedinto action when it wasadministered and produced all the white cells it could toward off the invader.However, AZT then went to war on these white blood cells,thus destroying theimmune system, and the patients die of \"AIDS\". No, theydon't. They die of thetreatment. Also, when you die of the so-called \"AIDSdiseases\" and you are HIV-positive, the diagnosis is recorded as \"AIDS\". Ifsomeone dies of those samediseases and they are not HIV-positive, the cause ofdeath is recorded as whateverthe disease was that killed them. In this way, itis built into the very death recordsthat only those with HIV die of AIDS. Thisis a lie, but it suits the Illuminati. For thetruth about AIDS and HIV, see thebrilliant book by Christine Maggiore, What IfEverything You Thought You KnewAbout AIDS Was Wrong (Health EducationAIDSLiaison, Los Angeles Chapter, 1996). It is available through my website andBridgeof Love. Christine was alerted to the lies and deceit when she had apositive HIVtest, followed by negative ones, followed by positive ones. Thewhole AIDSnetwork, the drug companies and the AIDS charities, are Illuminaticontrolled ormanipulated and it has created a multi-billion-dollar industrythrough which bothdrug companies and charities massively benefit. ChristineMaggiore realised howmuch the charities care about what is really happening whenshe took herdocumented and extensive research to them and was quickly shown thedoor.So where did AIDS come from? A disease very similar to AIDS, called theKalaazar,killed 60,000 in the south of Sudan. It destroys the immune system andthevictims die of other diseases. Africa has been a major target of disease byinjectionbecause the Illuminati want complete control of that continent with itsfantasticnatural wealth, and it has long embarked on a campaign of genocideagainst theblack African peoples. In 1988, the Ambassador of Senegal announcedthat AIDS hadravaged his country and whole villages were being decimated. A fewyears earlier,scientific and medical teams arranged through the World HealthOrganization had366Children of the Matrixcome to vaccinate the people against hepatitis B. A vaccine for hepatitis B wasalsotested on homosexuals in New York in 1978 and two years later in SanFrancisco, LosAngeles, Denver, Chicago, and St Louis, in a programme by theWorld HealthOrganization and the National Institute of Health. The \"AIDSepidemic\" beganamong the homosexual communities of those very cities in 1981. DrLanctot reveals:\"There are reports of collaboration between these two organizations in 1970 tostudythe consequences of certain viruses and bacteria introduced to childrenduringvaccination campaigns. In 1972...[they focussed]...on the viruses whichprovoked adrop in the immune mechanism. Wolf Szmuness directed theanti-hepatitis Bexperiments undertaken in New York. He had very close links withthe Blood Centerwhere he had his laboratory, the National Institute of Health,the National CancerInstitute, the Food and Drug Administration, the World HealthOrganisation, and theSchools of Public Health of Cornell, Yale, and Harvard [allIlluminati controlled]. In1994 a vast vaccination campaign against hepatitis Bwas undertaken in Canada. Itis useless, dangerous and costly. And what for? Isthere a hidden agenda? I wasthere in 1993. It troubled me to see that it wasaimed at a whole generation (1 to 20years), in only one province (Quebec). Sincewhen do viruses respect borders, andespecially provincial ones at that?\"16Dr Lanctot established that there was no hepatitis B epidemic, nor any riskofone. She said that three different vaccines were administered, each in adesignatedarea. Certain nurses were selected and trained to administer a specialvaccine; allchildren were entered into a computerised data bank; the pressure tovaccinate thechildren was enormous and schools were turned into clinics. Thosewho did notwant to be vaccinated were pointed out and treated as social outcasts(exactly thesame happened in the UK with the measles vaccine programme in the1990s).Nurses chased down parents at home who did not want their childrenvaccinated(ditto). Dr Lanctot knew one mother who did not want her child vaccinated. Anurse came to the house and made her think it was compulsory. The mother gaveinand the child is now physically and mentally handicapped. In 1986,withoutexplanation or permission from the parents, the hepatitis B vaccine wasgiven toNative American children in Alaska. Several died and many became illbecause ofwhat appears to have been a virus called RSV (Rous Sarcoma Virus) inthe vaccine.Native North American tribes have been the targets for many\"vaccinationprogrammes\" because the Illuminati want their lands and resources and tocomplete the genocide they began when the Europeans came. To this end, as Iknowfrom my own research, they have infiltrated the tribal elders and controltheagencies responsible for \"Indian affairs\" which answer to the FederalGovernment.Dr. Lanctot tells how she met a group of Native women to talk abouthealth and thesubject of vaccinations came up. The group's nurse told her thatthe federalgovernment had given her complete freedom in the management of theirhealth,but with one strict condition: every vaccination had to be scrupulouslyapplied toall. \"The silence was deafening. We all understood,\" Dr Lanctotrecalls.17367Death by doctorDoctors in the United States are now statistically more dangerous than guns.Everyyear there are around 120,000 deaths caused by doctor errors, an average of0.171,per doctor. There are 1,500 deaths by guns, an average of 0.000181 per gunowner.We have an outcry from many people for guns to be banned, fuelled byIlluminatipropaganda, and yet a doctor is, according to these figures, 9,000times more likelyto kill you.18 Hundreds of thousands of people are in hospitalsright now because ofthe effects of the drugs that were supposed to make themwell.19 The UK NationalAudit Office also highlighted the astonishing dangerspresented by \"modern\"medicine. They show that some 100,000 patients acquireinfections in UK hospitalsevery year, resulting in 5,000 deaths and making a\"substantial contribution\" toanother 15,000 fatalities. These figures alsoconfirm a report in the London DailyExpress, which claimed a massive cover-up byhospitals of the dangers patients facein their care and the scale of the annualdeath toll. The fact that the cause of death isa hospital-acquired infection isbeing hidden from patients' families and notmentioned on the death certificate.One of the other problems highlighted is that of the so-called\"super-bugs\",which have mutated an immunity to many antibiotics because doctorshave beenprescribing them like confetti for so long - another Illuminati plan todestroy theeffectiveness of the human immune system. As a result, they no longerkill the bugs.Such an outcome has long been predicted by \"alternative\" healersand others whocould see the obvious. It is staggering to consider the attacks bythe medicalprofession on \"alternative\" healing methods when figures prove thatthe dangers ofbeing treated by the Illuminati-controlled medical establishmentare infinitelygreater. These alternatives to the drug cartel and the medicalestablishment have tofight for their very existence against Illuminati-initiatedlaws to legislate them intooblivion. Even our right to take food supplements andnatural alternatives to drugsis being threatened by the Codex committee, anoffshoot of the World HealthOrganization. Public campaigns are already beingfought to protect the basichuman right of deciding what does or does not go intoour bodies. If we don't havecontrol of our own bodies, what freedoms are left?But that's where we are going. Inthe UK we pay multi-billions in our taxation tofund the National Heath Service orthe Human Debris Processing Unit, as I callit. But even though it is funded with thepublic's money, the public cannotdecide on the methods of treatment they have.Alternative methods are suppressedin favour of the scalpel and the drug.Food supplements are being taken to overcome the loss of nutrients we onceusedto get from our food. The emergence of chemical farming after the SecondWorldWar, which is destroying the soil and adding lethal poisons to the food,wasanother Illuminati operation. When this change in food production methodswasbeing introduced in the UK, the man behind it was Lord Victor Rothschild,friendand \"adviser\" (dictator) to shape-shifter, Ted Heath, as the head of theHeath'spolicy unit, the Central Policy Review Staff. Victor Rothschild was oneof the greatIlluminati manipulators of the 20th century (see ...And The TruthShall Set You Free).The Illuminati own the transnationals that make the poisonssprayed on our food -368Children of the Matrixand most of the farming land on which it is grown. They are now destroyingthenatural crop varieties and patenting their own replacements. These only growiffarmers use their \"fertilisers\" and the poisons they manufacture. It isagainst thelaw for poor farmers to use patented seeds unless they are boughtfrom thetransnationals (Illuminati) at the prices they demand. Destroying thenaturalvarieties is being done to ensure that these farmers have no alternative,but to do so.This is all co-ordinated in line with the agenda for the mental,emotional, andphysical control of the human race by the Anunnaki bloodlines. Allthesemanipulations are part of one manipulation, the Illuminati agenda.Micro-chipped populationThe most important goal of the Illuminati is a micro-chipped population. Theiraimis to have every person on the planet micro-chipped and every childmicro-chippedat birth. This is no science fiction fantasy. It is alreadyhappening. Of course, theywon't come out and be honest about it because theyknow that many people willresist (well, some, anyway). They are doing it bystepping-stones to obscure whatthe real game is. They began with themicro-chipping of animals, first voluntarilyand now often by law, and the samemethod is being used on humans. In 1997 afriend introduced me to a man inAmerica. He had asked to meet me because hewas a scientist working against hiswill on CIA secret projects that the run-of-the-mill politicians have no ideaare going on. When I asked him why he used hisgenius to advance the agenda, heopened his shirt and on his chest was a see-through \"sachet\", similar to thoseused for shampoo. The CIA calls them \"patches\".Inside I could see anorangey-golden liquid. He said that he joined the CIA in thebelief that he wasserving his country, but he soon realised that they did not wanthis knowledge tohelp humanity. The idea was to control them. When he began torebel against themisuse of his work, he left home one morning and remembersnothing else until hewoke up on a medical-type table. When he began to focus, henoticed the \"patch\"on his chest. They have manipulated his body to need the drugthe patch containsand it has to be replaced every 72 hours. If he doesn't do what heis told, theydon't replace the patch and he begins to die a long and painful death.Largenumbers of brilliant scientists, who could be setting the world free frompovertyand hunger, are in the same situation.This man told me about the micro-chipping agenda and much else besides.Hearranged to meet me to expose what was being planned for the human racebecausehe had no idea how long they would allow him to live. When thesescientists haveserved their purpose, the patch is no longer replaced and theydie painfully, takingwith them the knowledge of what is going on. First he saidthat the cure for cancerhas been known for decades, but they would not releasethis to the public becausethey did not want people to survive and were makingfar more money drugging thedying and treating the symptoms than they ever wouldcuring the disease. He saidthe technology existed to create abundant growth indeserts without water bystimulating the energy fields of the plants. At itsoptimum, it was like watching atime-lapse photograph, so fast did they grow, hesaid. This would eliminate hunger369by itself if it were made available. Blit this same technology was, instead,used to killthousands of people in a mass murder that he witnessed. The CIA (anIlluminatiagency) had gathered a vast multitude together in Ethiopia during thefamine. Hewas in a plane that he thought was flying over the area to cast avibrational fieldacross the land to stimulate plant growth. When he came to thefront of the plane tosee what was happening, he saw thousands of people lyingdead. They had beenkilled by the power of the magnetic field because the CIA wastesting his technologyas a weapon that could kill people, but not damageproperty. He also said that thetechnology to give us all the power and warmth weneed without pollution or utilitybills - free energy - has been known fordecades. I know this from people I have metwho are producing these systems, butthey can't get them into production becausethe Illuminati control the patentoffices, the money, and the major companiesrequired to mass-produce them.Imagine a piece of kit in your home giving youwarmth and power every day foreverwithout cost. Again this technology uses thepool of unseen vibrating energy allaround us and turns it into usable power. All thistechnology would be ours todayif it were not suppressed by the Illuminati.But it was when he turned to micro-chips that the CIA scientist becamemostanimated. He confirmed that the Illuminati plan was to micro-chip everybody.Onone level it was to tag us and keep a constant track of where we are and whatweare doing, he said. But the main reason was to manipulate at will our mentalandemotional processes. He said that people should not only think about themessagesgoing from the chip to the computer. Far more important were themessages fromthe computer to the embodied chip. He said people had nocomprehension of thelevel of technology in the Illuminati secret projects. Oncepeople were chipped, hesaid, the computer could make them docile or aggressive,sexually aroused orsexually suppressed, and close down their minds to a pointwhere they were likezombies. From where I am looking, I think it's alreadybegun! He asked me to urgepeople to resist the micro-chip at all costs becauseonce we concede to that wewould be nothing more than machines controlled by the\"aliens\" he confirmedwere behind the whole thing. We need a global campaign of\"SAY NO TO THECHIP\" and we need it NOW! The chip is in almost every piece oftechnology and isembedded in newer cars. This can externally immobilise theengine from satellite,as well as tracking every journey. As I predicted in mybooks of many years ago, itis already being suggested that people should bechipped to make the world moreefficient. Professor Kevin Warwick of ReadingUniversity in England has been usedto promote the use of the human micro-chip.He was implanted with a chip amidenormous publicity and has introduced us all tothe benefits of controllingelectronic devices at a distance. Wow. The latest Iheard was that he and his wife,Irena, were going to be implanted with anotherchip which would connect theirnervous systems to data processors, batteries, andradio transmitters. Apparentlytheir teenage daughter, Madeleine, was asked tojoin the exercise, but said \"Noway\". There is at least one thinking member ofthe family, then. \"This is the nextstep of merging man and machine,\" saidProfessor Warwick, \"We will be able tohave communications between two nervoussystems across the Net.\" Well glory be.370Children of the MatrixHe is being funded, according to the London Daily Mail, to the tune of some halfamillion pounds by major US Internet firms. Professor Warwick admits that heandhis wife could suffer permanent physical damage to their arms, but added thathehoped \"there will be no mental damage\". One wonders how they would tell.We are now seeing people chipped with their medical records and otherpersonaldetails. The plan is to sell the chip as a way to stop people beingmugged for theirmoney because their financial details would be on a chip undertheir skin.Preventing credit card fraud is another excuse. They will alsopromote the micro-chipping of children by claiming that they could never be lostagain because the chipcould always locate them. The more children that gomissing or are murdered andthe more they promote the danger of paedophiles inthe community, the more likelyparents are to be frightened into micro-chippingtheir kids. Of course, the greatestabusers and murderers of children are thevery Illuminati who are promoting thechip. Problem-reaction-solution. A guycalled David Adair, who has worked onhigh-tech projects with NASA, has been onthe New Age lecture circuit in Americafor years extolling the benefits ofmicro-chipping our children. I cannot believe thatsomeone with his insiderknowledge of secret technology would be unaware of whatthat would really mean interms of tagging and mind control. Implants have beenfound in people who claimto have been abducted by \"aliens”, and how manypeople are already micro-chippedwithout their knowledge? The CIA scientist toldme in 1997 that micro-chips inthe secret projects were now so small they could beinjected through a hypodermicneedle during mass vaccination programmes. Someyears later, a picture appearedin a British newspaper of an ant holding a micro-chipin its pincers and that'sonly the size they allow us to see. You will find that shot inthe picturesection. Chipping people so they can \"talk\" to their personal computersand theInternet is another approach. The London Sunday Times reported:\"The next computer you buy may be the last one you will need. In future,scientistswant to insert electronic chips into our heads so we can plug directlyinto theinformation superhighway. British researchers are among internationalteams workingon an implant to translate human thought into computer language. Ina generation,one group says, people with a peppercorn-sized chip in the back ofthe neck will beable to talk to machines.\"20What they don't tell you is that the machines will be able to talk to them, too.In...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I tell the story of Dr Carl W. Sanders, ahighlyacclaimed electronics engineer in the UK, who was developing amicro-chipimplant to help spinal injury patients. He said that his project washi-jacked by theone-world brigade and he attended 17 meetings with them inplaces like Brusselsand Luxemburg. He told Nexus Magazine:\"I was at one meeting where it was discussed: \"How can you control a people ifyoucan't identify them?\" People like Henry Kissinger and CIA folk attendedthesemeetings. It was discussed: \"How do you make people aware of the need forsomething like this chip?\" All of a sudden the idea came: \"Let's make them awareoflost children, etc. This was discussed in meetings almost like people werecattle. TheCIA came up with the idea of putting pictures of lost children onmilk cartons (whichthey did). Since the chip is now accepted, you don't seethose pictures anymore doyou? It's served its purpose.\"21Dr Sanders said they want the chip to contain the name and picture of theperson,an international (world government) social security number,fingerprintidentification, physical description, family and medical history,address, occupation,income tax information, and criminal record. People will betold that if they arechipped, they will have no need for passports or any otherpersonal paperwork andenough apparent benefits will be thrown in to persuade acomatose populationunaware of the game to agree to, literally, give their mindsaway. Or their brainfunction, anyway. Micro-chipping will begin as a voluntaryprogramme, withpeople encouraged to enjoy the convenience of being the clone ofa computer. Thenit will be made compulsory. The more missing children, terroristbombs, massshootings, and other horrors the Illuminati can engineer, the morethe compulsorymicro-chip will be \"justified\" and accepted by the sheeple. Thoserefusing the chipwill be said to have \"something to hide\" (the old trick), ornot care about themissing children or those killed and maimed in the bombingsand shootings. The\"threat\" of terrorists with nuclear devices in suitcases willalso get a mention, itusually does. The global computer network to which thesechips will answer isalready in place underground at many locations. One is inBrussels, Belgium, amajor Illuminati centre, and the location of NATO and theEuropean Union.Another is at Cheyenne Mountain in the United States.While I was writing this chapter, a company called Applied DigitalSolutionsannounced the launch of a human micro-chip it calls Digital Angel.Angel =reptilians. It is a human implant designed to monitor the wearer'sphysiology, likepulse and body temperature, and their location. The companyclaims it is the firstoperational human chip that can be linked to the globalpositioning satellitetracking systems. It will allow your every move anywhere onthe planet to betracked from satellite. It is also designed to connect with theInternet and to becomea user-identity device for the web. It is described as a\"dime-sized\" implant,inserted just under the skin. The chip will be powered\"electromechanically\"through the movement of muscles and it can be activated bythe wearer or themonitoring technology. It has, according to the officialstatements, been developedby Dr Peter Zhou and his research team and hasprogressed \"ahead of schedule\".The Illuminati agenda is not dependent on thenecessary technology becomingavailable by accident. It is developed well inadvance and is introduced in line withthe planned timescale. At that point weare told the technology has just beendiscovered when in fact it has been waitingin the wings for years. The tax-exemptfoundations, like the RockefellerFoundation, give vast sums to scientific research,but, as a US CongressionalCommittee established in the 1950s, they do not losecontrol of how the money isspent and insist that the research serves the needs of372Children of the Matrixthe global agenda. The Illuminati-controlled Princeton University was involvedinthe development of this micro-chip along with the New Jersey InstituteofTechnology. Dr Peter Zhou is the chief scientist at DigitaIAngel.net Inc., awhollyowned subsidiary of Applied Digital. He stresses, of course, the benefitsfor peoplebecoming human robots connected to a satellite. He said he was excitedabout hischip's ability to save lives by monitoring medical conditions andgiving an exactlocation to rescue services. I predicted many years ago that thiswould be one of theways they would sell the chip to the people when the timecame for its introduction.He said that the implant would become as popular ascell phones and vaccines (oneof which fries your brain and the other suppressesyour intellect and underminesyour immune system). Dr Zhou then delivered some ofthe most chilling sentences Ihave ever read:\"Digital Angel will be a connection from yourself to the electronic world. Itwill be yourguardian, protector. It will bring good things to you. We will be a hybrid ofelectronicintelligence and our own soul.\"22Just read those words again, especially the last sentence. This is whatweconspiracy \"theorists\" have been predicting for all these years and now it ishere. Iheard that the introduction of this particular chip design may now be insomedoubt, but it gives you an excellent idea of what is planned. And it is notonly thechip. Just look around you today and see all the methods of controlandsurveillance. You cannot walk through a town or city without moving fromonecamera to another. Go into a shop or take money from a wall machine, drive acar,catch a train or plane, and you are being watched. This unbelievable scaleofsurveillance has been introduced little by little by the Illuminati until youwake upone morning and realise that George Orwell's \"Big Brother\" is not justcoming -he's here. All the examples I have given in this chapter, and they areonly a tiny few,are each part of the same agenda. I cannot stress that enough.Seeing how all thesestrands are connected is the key to lifting the veil. Thereare pressure groupsfighting and uncovering the facts about environmentaldestruction, poisoned food,vaccinations, the drug cartel, oil cartel,transnational corporations of every kind,corruption in government, the bankingscam. Third World debt, manipulation ofwars, poverty, cancer, AIDS, child abuse,Satanic ritual sacrifice, media suppression,assassinations, erosion of freedoms,high taxation, and a whole list of others. Butwhat we need to see for the mistto clear is that these are all part of one agendaworking to one aim. All thescams are one scam. We can go on opposing theseindividual strands for a hundredlifetimes, but we will never make anyfundamental change until we stop focusingon the symptoms and start homing inon the cause of them all: the Anunnakibloodlines and their plan for a global fasciststate. Whenever something that hasremained hidden is close to becoming physicalreality, there must always be atime when it hits the surface and can be seen. This isthe period we are nowliving in. We are seeing massive global groups and empiresfusing with othermassive global groups and empires in banking, business, and373media, while the concentration of political power continues apace throughtheEuropean Union, \"free-trade areas,\" the United Nations. The same people havelongcontrolled all these aspects of our society, but now we can see they do asthey movethe final pieces into place for the global fascist state or \"New WorldOrder\".Losing their cover?One theme of many insiders and former insiders who have talked to me, is thatthereptilian shape-shifters are finding it more and more difficult to hold their\"human\"form. Maybe this is why so many more people seem to be seeing theshape-shiftersthese days. The explanation 1 am given is that the vibrationalfrequency of theplanet is changing as it completes a vast cycle and enters a newone. Some havecalled this new cycle the \"Age of Aquarius\" as the Earth movesthrough the area ofthe heavens dubbed \"Pisces\", which it entered around 2,000years ago, and into a\"new age\" of Aquarius. It is almost like passing through acurriculum at a schoolwith the different energy combinations affecting theEarth, offering different erasand experiences for those who choose to be here atthe time. The Maya peoples inthe Yucatan, Mexico, left records of theirmeasurement of \"time\" and their small,medium, and great cycles, of the Earth'sevolution. One of their great cycles, whichapparently began in 3113BC, is due tobe completed in 2012. Other researchers ofthese ancient measurements of \"time\"suggest that much longer cycles than this arealso ending in this same period.The base resonant frequency of the planet, knownas Schumann Cavity Resonance,was discovered in 1899 and remained prettyconstant until the mid-1980s when itbegan to quicken rapidly. This has continuedto increase and one effect of thesehigher vibrations is that \"time\" appears to bepassing much faster. Someresearchers, psychics, and \"mystics\" suggest that ourfrequency is getting closerevery day to the fourth-dimensional range. This wouldbe another explanation forwhy people are seeing shape-shifters more often andwhy the reptilians know thatthe day is fast approaching when they will not be ableto hide their real natureany longer. 1 am told that the sacrificial rituals and blooddrinking increaseddramatically from the mid-1980s as the vibrational changeforced them to workharder to hold human form.It is no coincidence that this period coincides with the completion oftheircentralised global state with its world army, micro-chipped population, andfiercestructure of globally centralised top-down control of all weapons,finance, media,and government. They know that we are going to see them in thenext few years asthey really are. Another role of the micro-chip could well beto close down that areaof the brain that would allow us to see them. We areclearly being prepared for thegreat unveiling, especially the children, by theexplosion of reptilian imagery andthemes in the mass media. The movies andtelevision are awash with dinosaurs and\"good guy\" reptilian characters inchildren's cartoons. The US television series calledV in the 1980s, now a WarnerVideo, produced a most accurate potential scenario, Ibelieve. It told the storyof a world controlled by reptilian extraterrestrials, which hidtheir true naturewithin an apparently human form. These extraterrestrials werecalled the\"Visitors\" and were given control of all the positions of power by374Children of the Matrixappearing to have humanity's interests at heart. They would announce thattheywere making available to humans this or that serum to cure this or that\"incurable\"disease. They also worked with compliant humans who were wellrewarded fordoing what they were told. One resistance group had realised thatthe \"Visitors\"were not human, but reptilian, and the movie shows how a few humanrebels,helped by some sympathetic reptilians, exposed the truth and killed the\"Visitors\"by releasing a disease that only affected them. There was, naturally,poetic licence inthe movie, but the basic theme was extremely accurate andwhoever came up withthe plot must know what is going on. 1 emphasise again herethat not all reptilianswish to control the planet and treat humans like cattle.1 am talking of one significantfaction. But if we don't focus on that factionand its agenda, we are going to deeplyregret not doing so. One victim ofIlluminati mind control, who claims to have seenthe reptilians in undergroundbases and other locations, said:\"Considering that the Dracos and Greys, in general, lack any sense ofspiritualintegrity, and are rather controlled for the most part by theirpredatory instincts, allefforts to negotiate with them are forever doomed tofail, just as if one were to try to'negotiate' with a cancer tumour. For inevery single case that I am aware of, theDracos and Greys have historically, andwithout exception, violated every one of theirso-called 'treaties' with thehuman race, and in fact have consistently used thesetreaties as weapons ofinfiltration and conquest.\"23It is a widely held view in the UFO research community that leadingworldgovernments, particularly the United States, have entered into \"treaties”of mutualbenefit with the reptilians and greys in return for technologicalknowledge, butthese \"agreements\" have been used to further establish theircontrol. If these reportsof such treaties are correct, they only tell part ofthe story. It depends which level inthe hierarchy you are dealing with. Forthousands of years, the top Anunnakibloodlines have been knowingly working tothe reptilian agenda. These guys didnot just arrive in the 1950s and start doingsecret deals with governments. Theyhave been here all along. If there were\"treaties\" agreed around that time it waswith those levels of government that donot have the big picture of what ishappening. 1 have heard it suggested manytimes, also, that an \"alien\" invasionforce is heading for this planet, but weshould be very careful here, 1 think. Whatbetter way to justify a global fasciststate, or giving power to the reptilians, than tosell the idea that we must joinforces to meet a threat from beyond. A Swiss delegateapparently wrote down thewords of Henry Kissinger at the 1992 Bilderbergmeeting in Evian-Les-Bains inFrance:\"Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restoreorder;tomorrow they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were toldthat there wasan outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, thatthreatened our veryexistence. It is then that all peoples of the world willplead with world leaders todeliver them from this evil. The one thing every manfears is the unknown. WhenServing the dragon: the future 375presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquishedfor theguarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government.\"What an irony it would be if the reptilians that have been here for hundredsofthousands of years, were wheeled out as our \"saviours\" from an \"alieninvasion\".But anything is possible given the stunning compliance of the humanmind, evenwithout the micro-chip. Many of the most important elements of thereptilianagenda are very close and if we are going to restore true freedom tothis planet, anddismantle the Anunnaki web, a vast number of people have got towake up andgrow up very quickly.SOURCES1 You will find the background to aspartame in the Medical Archives of the DavidIckewebsite and specific articles related to this section can be foundat:http://www.davidicke.net/medicalarchives/badmed/asparaddict.htmlhttp://www.davidicke.net/medicalarchives/badmed/lowdownaspartame.htmlhttp://www.davidicke.net/medicalarchives/cover/whoswho.htmlwww. dorway. com2 http://www.davidicke.net/medicalarchives/badmed/lowdownaspartame.html3 More background to Prozac is in the Medical Archives of the David IckeWebsite.

It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. Youcan seeit when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. Youcan feel itwhen you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.It is the worldthat has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.Morpheus in the movie, The MatrixWe think we live in a \"world\". In fact we live in a frequency range. That's allitis. We are trapped in a frequency range and therefore trapped in anillusion.This is what the well-known movie calls the Matrix.The \"world\" we see around us is merely the tiny fraction ofmulti-dimensionalinfinity that our physical senses of sight, hearing, touch,smell, and taste can access.The physical world we perceive is like a radiostation and our physical senses aretuned to its frequency. So that is all wesee. But all around us are the otherfrequencies or densities of infinitecreation - the ones that \"science\" has deniedexist. They are all around us onfrequencies beyond the range of our physicalsenses. These are the frequenciesthat can be seen and heard by animals, like cats,when they react to apparently\"empty\" space, and dogs when they hear sounds farhigher than we can. Newbornbabies also react to \"empty” space until their sensesare imprisoned byconditioning. These are the frequencies accessed by true psychics- the oraclesof the ancient world - who can raise their vibration to tune into theseunseenrealms. The Italian physicist Giuliana Conforto in her brilliant book LUH,Man'sCosmic Game (Edizioni Noesis, 1998) puts it like this:\"...a good 90% of total calculated mass is in fact dark and unobservable,whileonly 10% is observable by means of the infinite rainbow, which is light.The visibleuniverse we do observe, with its billions of stars and galaxies, isin turn only a narrowperspective of this already scanty 10%. ...Inside everyphysical body there is aninvisible, but far more massive reality (90%), anon-observable substance, that canbe felt and experienced as emotions,intuitions, and feelings.\"'It is within the realms of this unseen \"dark matter\" thatother-dimensionalentities like the reptilians operate. Giuliana Conforto alsopoints out that in somegalaxies, this dark matter, unseen by the human eye, is100 times the mass we can378Children of the Matrixobserve. We can see from our frequency range just 7% of what exists in suchgalaxies!2 When we open our minds and expand our own frequency rangeofperception, so we will \"discover\" more planets and stars. The atom is said tobe thefoundation of physical matter and yet all but a fraction of the spacewithin an atomis, to the human eye, \"empty\". A \"physical atom\" from which allphysical forms aremade, consists of a nucleus with electrons orbiting around itlike a mini solarsystem. Dr Douglas Baker said in his book. The Opening Of TheThird Eye (AquarianPress, Wellingborough, England, 1977): \"If we expanded thehydrogen atom to thesize of a cathedral, its electron would perhaps be the sizeof a nickel!\"3 Theoverwhelming majority of the \"space\" within an atom is \"darkmatter\" operatingon frequencies we can't see and it is the same with our solarsystem and the entiredense physical universe. If only \"science\" were led byGiuliana Conforto's way ofthinking, instead of the concrete minds of academia,we would already live in aworld of infinitely greater awareness of who we are and the nature of life. Butlookat her figures there and apply them to the \"scientific\" denials ofintelligent lifebeyond this planet. We are asked to believe that life as we knowit has only evolvedon this one physical planet among the billions of planets andstars in this visibleuniverse, which is, itself, only a fraction of visible\"light\", which is in turn only 10%of total mass? What a joke. God save us fromofficial \"science\". And, of course, allthis is only by current calculations.That fraction of 10% of total mass that we cansee might turn out to be anextremely optimistic view.The kingdom of heaven is within youAll around you now, and sharing the same space as your body, are all the radioand television frequencies broadcasting to your area. You can’t see them andtheyare not aware of each other because they are vibrating to such differentfrequenciesthat they pass through each other and your body without anyonenoticing. Theonly time they \"interfere\" with each other is when they are very close on thefrequency band. When you turn on your radio, the frequency you have accessedispassing through the windows and walls of your house to reach the radioreceiverbecause the walls and broadcast frequencies are so far apart on thedensity scale.This is how \"ghosts\" and \"extraterrestrials\" can apparently walkthrough wallsand why some people see them and others don’t. It depends whetheryour mind istuning to their frequency or not. These other-dimensional entities,including thereptilians, are all around us sharing the same space. You can sometimes feelthemwhen the vibes in a room change and you sense an icy chill or, with positiveentities, a feeling of great love in the atmosphere around you. They are soclose toour frequency range, but just outside it. Credo Mutwa talks of thevibrational\"blind spot\" that people have which prevents them from seeing theseentities and Ithink this is manufactured externally in some way, probablythrough a frequencybroadcast from below ground that shuts off part of our DNA’smulti-dimensionalpotential. The DNA is a transmitter and receiver of vibrationalinformation andcan therefore be reprogrammed by vibrational and electromagneticfields. NikolaTesla, whose genius was responsible for much of today's electricalsystem.understood that other frequencies existed, but the most profound parts ofhiswork were suppressed. He once said:\"We cannot even with positive assurance assert that some of them[otherdimensional entities] might not be present here in our world in the verymidst of us,for their constitution and life manifestations may be such that weare unable toperceive them.\"4As I said earlier, when you move the radio dial and tune to another stationyoucan no longer hear the first station because you have moved the dial out ofits rangeand so now you are hearing another. But the first station has notdisappeared, itgoes on broadcasting. It's just that you can't hear it anymore.If you choose toretune your dial again, there it will be. It is the same withCreation. We are likedroplets of water in an ocean of infinite energy takinginfinite forms. This ocean ofenergy manifests as different densities orfrequencies and at this moment we aretuned to this one, the \"physical world\".But all the other frequencies are around usand interpenetrating us while weperceive only the density that our physical sensescan see, touch, hear, smell,and taste - the Matrix. As physicist, Giuliana Conforto,put it: \"The fact thatwe are not able to observe [it] doesn't mean it doesn't exist,rather that humanperception is severely limited.” The late and great Bill Hicks, thebrilliant andhighly intelligent American comedian, encapsulated these truthsmagnificently. Hesaid:\"Matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. We are all oneconsciousnessexperiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death,life is just a dream,and we are the imagination of ourselves.\"5Look at the findings of Albert Einstein, the most famous scientist of the20thcentury. His E=MC2 shows that matter is just a form of energy and thatenergycannot be destroyed, only transformed into another state. It's official,ourconsciousness, which is energy, is indestructible. We live forever. The truthis infront of our eyes. Purely by changing the temperature (frequency), icebecomeswater and water becomes steam and steam \"disappears\". That simpletemperaturechange turns \"solid\" ice into invisible vapour because differenttemperaturesrepresent different frequencies. It is all the same energy, but in avery different state.Our bodies consist of many different sub-frequencies withinthe dense physicalrange. Look at X-rays. They are tuned to frequencies thatmatch our bone structureand so they do not portray the outer flesh, which isvibrating to a differentfrequency. X-rays don't show the walls of buildings,just the rods of iron withinthem for the same reason. Look at the world from theX-ray frequency and it looksvery different than it does from ours. How an objector person appears dependspurely on the frequency from which you are observing.The human aura, astechnology has shown, is a mass of different colours(frequencies) that change asour thoughts and emotions (frequencies) change. TheX-ray is just one example of380Children of the Matrixfrequencies that science has confirmed exist, but we can't see. Ultraviolet,gamma-rays, infra-red, radio waves, etc., are some of the others. But had yousuggestedto a conventional scientist that any of those existed before they wereofficiallydiscovered and he would almost certainly have called you ridiculous ordangerous.Every scientific \"norm\" since the dawn of the \"scientific age\" hasbeen proved withtime to be either flawed, not the full picture, or, often,unbelievably inaccurate andpatently ludicrous. Yet generation after generationsociety clings to the \"scientific\"norms of its day until its knuckles turn whiteand its hair turns grey. \"Science\" goeson judging possibility by the apparent\"laws\" of this frequency range and yetscientists know that 90% of the mass ofexistence, what they call \"dark matter\", isnot subject to these laws likegravity and those of the electromagnetic field. If wetake the laws of physics asthey may apply to one frequency and judge what ispossible in other frequencieson the same basis, we will be in ignorance forever.What applies to one, does notapply to another.There is no spoonThe key point in Bill Hick's superb encapsulation of hidden truth is: We aretheimagination of ourselves. Our lives, our physical experience, are amanifestation ofour thoughts. We are what we think we are. Our imagination ofself and the worldaround us becomes our physical experience. You think you areordinary? You willbe \"ordinary\". You think you are powerless? You will bepowerless. You think thebest things in life happen to others? So they will.Everything is created by thought -our thoughts. In this dense, treacle-like,frequency range we live in, the timebetween the thought and its physicalmanifestation can appear to take a long time,but thought is still the creator.For instance, look around you now wherever you are.The buildings, furniture, andall the trinkets and utensils, are provably created bythought. Unless someonehad thought to design them and thought to make themthey could not exist. Withoutthe thought there can be no physical creation. In otherrealms, where the energyis far less dense, the thought and its manifestation aresimultaneous. Thethought becomes manifest in an instant. All this means that welive in a world ofillusion because the world is a reflection, a mirror, of humanthought. What wethink the world is, it will be. Or at least that will be ourperception of whatit is. In the movie, The Matrix, a little boy is bending spoons atwill. But hesays that the real truth is: \"There is no spoon...it is not the spoon thatbends,it is only yourself.” What is real? Real is merely what you believe is real.Asthe Morpheus character in The Matrix says: \"Real is just electrical signalsinterpretedby your brain.\" For goodness sake, we don't even see objects, onlythe light they arereflecting. Close the curtains and turn off the light. Whatcan you see? Nothing. Andif you can see anything it is only because some lightsource is reflecting fromwhatever you can see. The term \"dark matter\" refers tothat which does not reflectlight in our frequency range and therefore we cannotsee it. We don't see anything,except reflected light. Even then the objectenters our eyes upside down and has tobe flipped over by the brain so weperceive it the right way up! And we don't even\"hear\" sound as such. Our earsconvert pressure passing through the atmosphereinto a series of waves and our brain transforms these waves into aperceived\"sound\". This is what televisions and radios do. The broadcasts don'ttravelthrough the air as pictures and sounds. Can you imagine episodes ofFriends orFrasier flying over the rooftops? Or hearing all the radio shows onevery stationsimultaneously wherever we went? Of course not. It doesn't workthat way. Theprogrammes are sent as broadcast waves, and television and radiotechnologydecodes them into pictures and sound.Welcome to my worldWe each live in our own personal universe and when people come into ourspacethey are entering our unique world of reality. There are areas where ouruniversesagree and connect. Most people, for example, agree that the roadoutside your doorand the cars driving past really exist. But apart from thesebasics, our universes canbe very different. In my universe, to chase a fox withhorses and hounds and tear itto pieces is an abomination. But to otheruniverses, it's fine to do that. In myuniverse, a few people are controlling theplanet through a network of secretsocieties working through all \"sides\". But inmost other human universes these\"sides\" are completely unconnected and the worldhas an infinite diversity ofdecision-making and ownership. In my universe, someof the most famous peopleon the planet are torturing and sacrificing children.But most other humanuniverses cannot conceive that such horrors could be takingplace and so in theiruniverses, they don't. Our minds observe the visible,physical world, and what wemake of it becomes our reality, our personaluniverse. Because I see the world andevents in very different terms to mostpeople, there are far fewer points ofagreement and connection between myuniverse and those of the mass of thepeople. For this reason, I am consideredstrange, extreme, or a \"nutter\". But that isonly those people's perception of mefrom the perspective of their own universe. It'snot what really is, only whatthey believe it is. It's a self-generated illusion.You can prove over and over that the physical world is controlled by thenon-physical mind. A stage illusionist can convince millions of minds that hehasperformed a \"miracle\" when it is just sleight of hand. There is one trick inwhich agirl is tied up and placed in a large box. The lid is shut tight and,after a roll ofdrums, the magician opens the box to find that the woman hasdisappeared. Whatshe has done is hide in the box's false bottom giving theappearance that it is empty.The magician then moves to an identical box on theother side of the stage. When heopens it the woman miraculously reappears towild applause. The minds of theaudience have been convinced that somehow thewoman has been transported fromone box to the other. This, therefore, becomestheir reality, part of their universe. Butyou know what really happens? Themagician uses identical twins wearingidentical clothes. It's that simple todelude the mind. 1 sat next to a guy on atelevision programme who ripped up thefront page of the morning paper,crumpled the pieces together in his hands, andthen opened it out in its originalstate. I was no more than two feet away. Heripped that paper to pieces. I saw him.But of course he didn't. He justconvinced everyone that he did and once a mind is382Children of the Matrixconvinced of something it becomes that person's physical reality. A stagehypnotistcan manipulate a member of the audience into believing that dog pooh isa primepiece of steak or that the woman next to him is naked or that he isanything from adonkey to a racing driver. The Illuminati are simply applyingthese techniques on amass scale because they know how it all works - that's theknowledge they haveworked so incessantly to keep from us.Creating our own realityWe are not our physical bodies. That is merely one level of us for a short timewhilewe experience this frequency range. The body is a holographic projectionthat allowsour consciousness to interact with the dense physical realm. Platosaid, quite rightly,that all bodies are only the shadows of true reality. Everyparticle of a hologramcontains a picture of the entire image. This is why everycell of the body contains theinformation needed to create an entire body. Ahologram is an illusion. It is not 3-D,but it looks 3-D. Same with the body.\"Conventional\" medicine concentrates purelyon the holographic image and ignoresthe multi-frequency forces like thought andemotion that can harmonise ordestabilise that image. Thus, official medicine has itsentire focus on thesymptom and not the cause of physical dis-ease, disharmony. Weare certainly morethan our bodies. We are, in truth, all that exists, has existed, andever willexist. I am you, you are me, I am everything and everything is me. We arenotonly part of that infinite energy from which everything manifests, we arethatenergy. All of it, all of us. In the end there is no \"me\" or \"we\", just oneinfinite \"I\".Look out at the world. Look at the explosion of planets and starsin the night sky. Allof it is you and that's only the fraction of you that yourphysical senses can see. Weare all one energy, all each other. The divisionsbetween us are an illusion andconflicts between us are conflicts and illusions within ourselves. The outerconflict isthe expression of the inner conflict and those who come into ourspace, positive qrnegative, are outer projections of our own inner state ofbeing. In this way, those whohate themselves and have no self-esteem attract, vibrationally, into theirlives, theiruniverse, people who will punish them. They don't know they are doing this, it'sallplayed out in the subconscious mind. Look at how many women who arebeatenviolently by their partner end up with a new partner who also beats themviolently. Ihave known women who changed partners four or five times and everyoneknocked the living shit out of them. Until the inner self changes, its outermanifestation cannot change. All the answers are within, not without. That'swhythe Illuminati encourage and manipulate us to look outside of ourselves foranswers.They know that this way we will never find them. They want us to believethat theanswers lie in the physical world, the \"mirror\", when that is just areflection of whatwe are projecting from within. Thus, we see solutions in newlaws and new powersfor the police and authority when that is only papering overthe cracks and divertingus from the real problem - the state and attitudes ofthe inner self, our consciousness.The Illuminati are delighted with this becausethey know that nothing fundamentalwill ever change until we go to the source ofall experience - inside ourselves. Theywant us to believe that we can change themovie by focusing on the screen when theonly way to change the movie is to change what is being projected on thescreen.One simple example: if we loved each other, there would be no conflict inthe world.Because we don't, there is. It's just a choice and those choicesbecome manifest on thenews and in our lives every day.The reptilian brainThe more you understand about the reptilian mind the easier it is to seetheAnunnaki-Illuminati at work in our society across the centuries. They havedistinctcharacter traits and they are seeking to make humans the same. Thesereptiliancharacteristics and their connection to the human brain are fundamentalto theperpetuation of the illusions 1 call the Matrix. For those who,understandably, findeven the idea of a reptilian race to be unimaginable, nevermind the shape-shifting,1 repeat the words of cosmologist Carl Sagan: \"There aremore potentialcombinations of DNA [physical forms] than there are atoms in theuniverse.\" Farfrom it being impossible for such a race to emerge, it would bemore surprising if ithad not. Studies have suggested that if the dinosaurs hadsurvived, and some mayhave done so within the Earth, they would have evolved areptilian humanoid formby now. Dale Russell, the senior palaeontologist at NorthCarolina University, wasasked by the US space agency NASA to produce a report onwhat extraterrestriallife might look like. He evolved the Troodon dinosaur inline with genetic changesover millions of years and created a model of a beinghe called a dino-sauroid. Itwas a reptilian humanoid and identical to those thatabductees and others haveclaimed to see. There is so much more to know about thedinosaurs. After all, theirexistence was only discovered by scientists in the1880s. Credo Mutwa and otherssay that reptilians originated on this planet andwere driven off before returning toclaim what they believe is rightfully theirs.Maybe, maybe not. We only have theirword for that and their word does not seemto be worth a lot. But this planetcertainly has an enormous reptilian history.While 1 was writing this book, it wasrevealed that the fossil of a reptile thatwalked on two legs had been found in aGerman quarry in rock estimated to be atleast 300 million years old. The finddemolished previous scientific belief onreptilian evolution. Dinosaurs were not, asbelieved, the first reptiles to runon two legs. This newly-discovered biped,Eudibamus cursoris, was a reptileunrelated to the later dinosaurs. The Eudibamusskeletal structure suggests thatit could run swiftly, probably standing up on itstoes, with its forelimbsswinging in a pendulum-fashion. This is similar to theposture adopted by runninghumans, say the US, Canadian and German scientists.Researcher Alan Walton hascompiled a large amount of background to the reptilianpresence on Earth. Hesays:\"Aside from reports and even photos of human footprints found fossilized insideofdinosaurian prints, suggesting a common existence - I discovered someinterestingbiological facts concerning 'reptilians'. It seems that biologistsagree that snakesultimately mutated from lizards, and lizards from the larger'thunder lizards' ordinosaurs of ancient times. And what was the earliestdinosaur discovered? Well the384Children of the Matrixtwo contenders are the Eoraptor (which gave rise to the very cunning anddexterousVeloci-raptors as depicted in the Jurassic Park movies) and a similarsaurian bipedwhich walked upright like a man, about the size of a human being,and with handsthat were ideal for grabbing and ripping flesh, the herrerasaurus:both were meat-eaters, however there are enough differences and similaritiesbetween Eoraptor andHerrerasaurus to suggest that they had a common ancestor a'few branches down'the saurian tree.\"6The most ancient part of the brain is known by scientists as the R-complexor\"reptilian brain\" (Figure 46). It is the most obvious remnant of our reptiliangenetichistory, apart from those who are still born with tails. This reptilianbrain or R-complex is vital to understanding the ways that the Illuminatimanipulate humanthinking and perception. Most people have no idea of thereptilian heritage of thehuman body and its influence on our behaviour.Scientists say that the R-complexrepresents a core of the nervous system andoriginates from a \"mammal-like reptile\"that was once found all over the world inthe Triassic period (205-240 million yearsago). It is believed this was anevolutionary link between the dinosaurs and themammals. There may be otherexplanations, too! All mammals have this reptilianpart of the brain. Now look atthe character traits of the reptilian brain as agreed byscientists. I quote herefrom a fascinating Internet article by Skip Largent:\"At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain ...Withoutdefiningthem, I shall simply say that in human activities they find expressionin: obsessive-compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals andsuperstitious acts; slavishconformance to old ways of doing things: ceremonialre-enactments; obeisanceto precedent, as in legal, religious, cultural, andother matters...and all mannerof deceptions.\"7Add other traits of the R-complex such as \"territoriality\" (this is mine, getout);aggression; and the idea that might-is-right, winner-takes-all. Put thatlittle lottogether and you have the very attitudes of the Illuminati. Racismcomes from thereptilian brain also and aggressive, violent sex, which theIlluminati bloodlinesindulge in big time - ask US Presidents \"father\" GeorgeBush and Gerald Ford, VicePresident Dick Cheney, and the list of other famousIlluminati names 1 expose in mybooks. Can it really be a coincidence that theIlluminati manifest the classic traits ofthe reptilian brain while, at the sametime, the evidence suggests that they arereptilian bloodlines? Cosmologist CarlSagan, who knew far more than he wastelling, wrote a book, The Dragons Of Eden(Ballantine Books, New York, 1977), tohighlight the reptilian influences onhumanity. He said: \"...It does no goodwhatsoever to ignore the reptiliancomponent of human nature, particularly ourritualistic and hierarchicalbehaviour. On the contrary, the model may help usunderstand what human beingsare all about.\" Other areas of the human brainbalance the extremes of thereptilian characteristics in most people, but they can stillbe seen, forexample, in those who live their lives as a daily ritual, such as going to385Picture #87 [images/img_0087.png]the same supermarket at the same time everyweek and having the same meals onthesame days. Those with the most dominantreptilian traits, the Illuminatibloodlines,would, it seems obvious, express more ofthose characteristicsassociated with thereptilian brain and so you have the reptilianbloodlines ofthe Illuminati utterly obsessedwith ritual. Equally obviously, thereptiliansunderstand the R-complex better thananyone and how it can bemanipulated.Figure 46: The reptilian brain or \"R-complex\" is Predictably, therefore, it isthrough thean ancient part of the human brain. From here reptilian part of the brain thathumanity iswe get the character traits of cold-blooded most controlled and directed.behaviour, the desire for top-down hierarchy, The human brain is in two parts orand an obsession with ritual. These are, ■ , ., ■ , . , ■ , ., , r., . ,, .. . hemispheres, the right brain and the left-balanced by other parts of the brain in humans, . r ebut not in the full-blown reptilians, whichbram’ connected by a mass of nervefibres,manipulate this planet The left side is the rational, logical, and\"intellectual\". It works closely with thephysical senses and can be summed up bycan 1 touch it, see it, hear it, smell it, ortaste it? OK, it must exist. Itcommunicates through spoken words and writtenlanguage. The right brain is wherewe manifest imagination, intuition, instincts,dream-states, the sub-conscious.It is the artist, musician, creative inspiration. Itcommunicates through imagesand symbols, not words. This right side is closelyrelated to the R-complex.Reptilians communicate through imagery and symbols -just like the Illuminatisecret society network as widely detailed in The Biggest Secretand on mywebsite. They have an entire secret language based on symbols. Thisbrings us tothe most effective form of human conditioning by the Illuminati -movies andtelevision. As Skip Largent says:\"All movies and television are a projection of the reptilian brain. How so?Movies andtelevision (video games etc.) are all undeniably dreamlike, not onlyin theirpresentation of symbolic-reality, but also in that humans experiencingmovies, etc.,have the same brain wave patterns as when they are dreaming. Andguess wheredreaming originates in your head? In the reptilian brain (althoughother parts of ourbrain are involved) ...The \"language\" of the reptilian brainis visual imagery. Allcommunications transferred by reptiles are done so byvisual symbolicrepresentations, each having specific meaning.\"8And this is precisely what the Illuminati do. So how does this relate tohumancontrol? The movie and television industries are not only owned anddirected bythe Illuminati - they created them. They understand how visual imagescan be usedto condition the population. In normal circumstances, thereptilian-dominated rightbrain receives images through the eyes or theimagination, and the left brain386Children of the Matrixdecodes those images into thoughts, words, and conclusions. The Illuminati-Anunnaki have intervened in this process, however, to control the human mind.Their aim is to disconnect the functions of these two distinct parts of thebrain so wecan be manipulated through the right brain while only being consciousof the left.They plant images into the right brain (the dream-state, the non-conscious)usingsymbolism, subliminal imagery, and pictures, while often telling the leftbrain howit should interpret those images. This is done through \"education\",\"science\", andthe media. The television news is a classic. The right brain isshown pictures ofthousands of refugees pouring across the border out of Kosovowhile the reporter'svoice-over tells the left brain how to interpret thosepictures: i.e. the refugees werefleeing Serbian atrocities. This explanationincreased public support for NATObombing of the Serbs. What later emerged, ofcourse, is that many of those refugeeswere actually fleeing the effects of theNATO bombing. Same images, but a verydifferent story or interpretation. It isthe same with newspaper pictures in which thecaption interprets the image forthe reader's left brain. Often what the caption saysis not the true background to what the reader is seeing. What is happening allthetime is that the left-brain is being told by external sources how to decoderight brainimages. What we need to do urgently is regain control of our leftbrains and decidefor ourselves what our right brain images mean. That requiresbreaking away fromthe herd, thinking for ourselves, and questioning all that wesee and hear. Thatincludes what you are reading in this book. If it doesn't makesense, walk away.You will find that words like imagination, imagine, dream, and such like areusedconstantly in advertising. They know that if they can use trigger words thatencourage a right brain, non-conscious, day dream state, they can access yourmindwith imagery and then tell your left brain how to decode it into consciouslanguage- \"I want that car\"; \"I think the police should be given more powers tostop crime\";\"I need to take Viagra to be a proper man again\"; \"We need a world government tosolve our problems\". Television and movies are producing a fantasy world ofmake-believe to open up the unconscious right brain and allow the Illuminati asecretaccess through that to the conscious mind. Children are most at risk fromthis andthey are being bombarded with fantasy images to this end. In earlychildhood, themental state is controlled almost exclusively by the reptilianbrain and thepurveyors of children's \"entertainment\" like Disney exploit thisknowledge. Disneyis a major Illuminati operation. Music is used in the same way.There is nothingwrong with music in itself, and the same with fantasy anddream-states, so long aswe are doing our own decoding. As with everything, it isthe way this ismanipulated that I am talking about. And who controls the music industry?Thesame people who control Hollywood and the global media in general -theIlluminati. The biggest music operation in the world, for instance, isUniversalMusic, controlled by the Bronfmans of Canada, which also controlsUniversalStudios. The Bronfmans were a gangster family during prohibition andlater ownersof one of the biggest liquor operations on the planet, Seagrams. The Bronfmanscontrol a stream of other media organisations including such deeplyintellectual,mind-expanding, programmes as The Jerry Springer Show. UniversalMusic is theforce behind the Satanic \"shock rocker\" Marilyn Manson. The Illuminati controlthemusic industry and it is widely used for subconscious and vibrationalconditioning.A former employee of the music corporation, EMI, told me how theyhad\"supervisors\" who ensured that only the \"right\" artists the \"right\" musicweresigned and promoted. The Bronfmans are a reptilian bloodline and very closeto theRothschilds. It is the Bronfmans, through various front organisations andstooges,particularly operating out of their headquarters in eastern Canada, whoare seekingto stop me speaking all over the world. In accordance with theIlluminati method ofcontrolling all sides in a debate or conflict, two of themost vociferous critics ofEdgar Bronfman junior, the head of Universal Pictures,are former Bush and Reagancabinet minister. Bill Bennett, the shape-shiftingchild abuser exposed by CathyO'Brien, and Joseph Lieberman, thevice-presidential running mate of blood drinkerand shape-shifter, A1 Gore. Thispair say that Universal Studios encourage people tobe immoral! Is there noshame?Manufacturing illusionsThrough the reptilian brain, the Anunnaki-Illuminati manipulate our perceptionofreality. This frequency range or physical world is controlled and manipulatedfromoutside, from another frequency range or density, which I have called thefourthdimension. As in the movie, The Matrix, the \"agents\" of this force comeinto thisworld to delude and manipulate us - like the other-dimensional Men inBlack.They do it through direct manifestation, aided by the Satanic rituals, orbyoccupying and possessing the bloodlines that most resonate with them -theIlluminati bloodlines. Some of these \"agents\" appear to be capable of\"miraculous\"feats. But they are not miraculous at all. It is just that they areusing a knowledgeof physics and energy that is systematically kept from us. Theyknow that thisworld is not solid, only that it appears to be. Everything from abreath of air to adrop of rain, to a mountain or a ten-ton truck is vibratingenergy. Look at anythingunder a microscope, no matter how dense and \"solid\" itmay seem to be, and youwill see that it is just vibrating energy. The slower itvibrates, the more solid itlooks, the faster it vibrates the more ethereal andtransparent it appears until itsspeed moves beyond our physical senses and it\"disappears\". Look at a simplespoked cartwheel. When it is turning slowly thespokes looks very solid. But whenit is travelling at speed the spokes are just ablur and no longer \"solid\" at all. In factthey can even give the illusion ofgoing backwards while the cart is goingforwards. Optical illusions are justsimple expressions of the Great Illusion. 1 havebeen writing for ten years thatthe speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, is notthe fastest speed possible.It is only an outer limit of our frequency range, afterwhich anything travellingabove that speed enters another range, another densityand we cease to perceiveit. This is how UFOs and extraterrestrials appear and\"disappear\", and howdemonic entities manifest and de-manifest at Satanic rituals.They switchfrequencies. As John A. Keel points out, the colour changes seenininterdimensional materialisations are often described in \"UFO\" sightings asthe\"objects\" scan the electromagnetic spectrum. \"UFOs often appear as a puiplish388Children of the Matrixblob and then descend the visible scale until they turn red,\" he wrote \"atwhichpoint they sometimes solidify into seemingly material objects.\"We exist on all dimensions and densities in the Great Infinity. At our core wearepure love, what some people call the spark or flame of God within all of us.At thatlevel of our infinite self, we are vibrating at incredible speed. Thereis no form. Weare pure energy. We just are. Everything just is. We are all one.We are consciouslyeverything that has ever, does, or will ever exist. These isno time, no location. Weare all time, all places, all thought and feeling. Weinterpenetrate all existence. Weare the infinite and the ultimate. And that is everybody, no matter what you maybe doing at the moment in this Great Illusion. But to experience all thedensities onour endless journey of experience, that spark, that pure love, hasto surround itselfwith an outer shell that resonates with the frequency range itwishes to experience.Without that, it could not interact with that \"world\" because it would be toofaraway on the dial. If my consciousness did not surround itself with a physicalbodyon the same frequency range as this \"world\" I could not tap the keys of thiscomputer. My consciousness would pass straight through them. For this reason,ourinner spark of pure love has taken on a vast number of outer \"bodies\" tointeract with and experience all densities down the scale. We are, therefore,like aseries of Russian dolls, one inside the other, all vibrating at differentspeeds. Andall, except that spark of love that interpenetrates all existence,are illusions ofvarying degrees. The dense physical body, the outer of all theshells, is thereforepart of the greatest illusion because it not only has its own personalillusions, itencompasses all the others, too.The nearest \"bodies\" to the dense physical are the etheric, astral, mental andemotional. They are all vibrating at higher speeds than our physical senses andsowe can't see them, although psychic people can when they access thosefrequencies.We feel them, however, as good and bad \"vibes\". The etheric is amirror image ofthe physical, but less dense, and the lower levels of the astralfrequency rangeflower fourth dimension) appear to be the realms from which theIlluminatidemons, reptilians, and other malevolent \"extraterrestrials\" largely operate.The\"lower astral\" is the traditional home of malevolent entities in esotericthought.Abductees have reported that when they looked at their bodies during anextraterrestrial experience they looked different to normal and, as we sawearlier,the American, Jim Walden, said that his body looked like those of the\"aliens\" whoabducted him. Walden felt that this was another dimension of him, whichinhabitedhis human form. He believed from his experiences that the \"aliens\" couldtranscendtime, transform matter, manipulate human thought and behaviour, andcreate\"distracting illusions to satisfy the needs of our simple human minds\".9 Heconcluded that they could move between dimensions and that they wereless\"extraterrestrial\" and more \"interdimensional\". I think that is correct. Thedemonicentities and the malevolent faction of the reptilians are overwhelminglyastralbeings that can move between densities, thus appearing human one minuteandthen shape-shifting into something else the next. They are like those agents inTheMatrix movie. But, also like those agents, they are still stuck in an illusion389themselves. It might be less of an illusion than humans because they know ofotherdimensions and so on, but they are still stuck in their astral illusion ashumans arestuck in the physical one. The Matrix character, Morpheus, says of the agents:\"I have seen an agent punch through a concrete wall; men have emptied entireclips [ofbullets] on them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and theirspeed are stillbased on rules. Because of that, they will never be as strong oras fast as you can be.\"That is why the Illuminati and their other-density masters have worked so hardtosuppress our minds. They know that we are potentially far more powerful thanthey are if only we can free ourselves of their mind control. Their aim, ineffect, is tokeep us in a bigger illusion than their own. It is like the short sightedmanipulatingthe blind. Within every human is a genius waiting to manifest. Inever cease to beamazed at the levels of excellence that humans achieve in thewhole range ofprofessions and talents. Find someone at the top of his or her craft and youwill bein awe at their brilliance. And this is despite all the manipulation andsuppressionof our potential. Just think what we could achieve when this controlis dismantled.The climax in The Matrix movie is when the initiate, Neo, ceasesto see the world asa series of \"solid\" people and buildings and instead seeseverything and everyoneas a flow of fast moving numbers and codes - vibrationalfrequencies. Once hereaches this point of awareness and multi-dimensional connection, he is able tobrush aside the previously unbeatable agents of human servitude because he canoperate outside of their rules and limitations. Symbolically he has expandedthepoint of his awareness beyond the astral realms to much higher levels ofhimself.Higher levels than his controllers can access. Once he achieved that, hebecomes aspowerful to the agents as they were to him when he was still in thephysical illusionand they were in the astral one. How do we get out of thismess? We open up towho we really are and let go of who the system tells us weare. The whole Illuminatiplan has been designed to keep us trapped in thephysical illusion and thereforeensure that we can be controlled and manipulated by their astral illusion. Thisiswhy, among so many other things, they have done the following:• Systematically destroyed or kept hidden as much ancient knowledge as possiblebecause it contained the understanding of who we are and the true nature oflife.• Hi-jacked all the major investigations and searches for ancient hiddenknowledge and artefacts across the world to ensure that nothing is found thattells the truth of our nature and origins and, if anything significant is found,it isnever made public nor its true importance understood.• Created religions to seize the minds of the populace, fill them with a senseoflimitation and inferiority, and portray esoteric knowledge as \"evil\".• Established \"science\" to recognise only the physical, deny the existence ofotherfrequencies of life, and suppress the knowledge of our multi-dimensionalselves.This is done by rewarding those who repeat the party line and destroyingthereputations of those who do not390Children of the Matrix• Introduced the media to assault our minds with the reality the Illuminati wishusto have; and to attack, ridicule, condemn, and destroy anyone who threatenstoexpose the scam and the illusion on which it depends.• Bombarded us with an orgy of physical stimuli and materialism in whichsuccessis judged by what you own rather than what you are.• Focused the world and communication on all that is physical - money,winningthe lottery, possessions, and promoting an obsession with sex as aphysicalrather than a spiritual experience. Sex based on lust alone holds downourfrequency because it is a purely physical act. Sex based on love increasesourfrequency because it reconnects us with our spark of pure love.• Isolated male and female energy, so creating the duality and preventing thefusionof male and female energy within us all that would create a third,potentiallyhigh-vibrational force, and set us free of this vibrational prison,the Matrix.• Filled our food, drink, medicines, vaccines, water, air, andelectromagneticenvironment, with chemicals and frequencies designed to suppressour ability toexperience our multi-dimensional selves and to block the channelsthroughwhich our higher levels can communicate with the physical.• Manipulated our DNA directly and through other means to dim thishigher-dimensional connection. The genetic code agenda that is sold to ussopositively as a way of preventing disease has a far more sinisterbackgroundand motivation.• Held highly malevolent Satanic rituals at the planet's major vortex points toholddown the frequency of the entire global energy field - the field that weoperatewithin. In this way, our own energy field can be vibrationally suppressedbyliving within such a low vibrational environment.• Created wars and conflicts at all levels of global society and ensuredfinancialdependency and insolvency to keep us in low vibrational emotionalstates likefear, guilt, anger, resentment, and frustration.The vibrational prisonThis manipulation, together with the physical illusion, means that we accessonly afraction of our potential consciousness. We are literally in a vibrationalprison,disconnected by all these methods from the multi-dimensional ocean thatwe reallyare. These astral entities work to maintain and expand this situationand thusmaintain and expand their control of the billions entrapped in theillusion. At thesame time, the low-vibration emotional energy that the illusioncauses us togenerate is vibrating to the lower astral frequency range. Thismeans that a cycle iscreated in which the astral manipulators use their energyto set up physical events;these events cause emotional reactions that generateemotional energy; this poursinto the astral dimension; and the astral entitiesrecycle it back to continue andincrease the cycle still further. In The Matrix,it is said that we live in a computer-generated dream world built to keep usunder control and to use humans like abattery. Symbolically that is correct. Theonly ones who can break the cycle are391ourselves by ceasing to fall for the illusion and so generating the emotionalenergythe reptilians and others demand. Morpheus tells his initiate, Neo, in TheMatrix:\"...you are a slave Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Borninto aprison that you cannot smell or taste or touch - a prison for your mind.Unfortunately,no one can be told what the Matrix is - you have to see it foryourself ...I'm trying tofree your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door.You're the one that has towalkthrough it.\"Or, as the aerospace scientist Dr Gordon Allen said in his book,EnigmaFantastique, after a lifetime of study:\"The purpose today is identical to the purpose in the times of themagician-scientistsof ancient times, the purpose of the controlling priesthoodof the Egyptians, theCaesars, the Roman Catholic Church, the Inquisition. Theecclesiastic control of thevarious ruling families had for its purpose the ruleof the people in their materialbodies on this Earth-plane ...A nation is said byEastern philosophers to lie undercertain occult (or secret) controls. Nationswho go to war on the Earth-plane reflectcertain wars in Heaven.\"101 think there is validity in the myths and legends that consciousnessbecametrapped in this dense physical frequency range and, as its own frequencyfell, itcould not get out. We are talking maybe of millions, even billions, ofyears agowhen this began. The Fall of Man was a vibrational fall, perhaps. Icertainly wouldnot rule out for a moment that at least the early stages of whatis known asFemuria/Atlantis, were fourth-dimensional, not third-dimensionalphenomena,and they might still exist in fourth-dimensional reality. Thefourth-dimensionalrange is very close to this one and it could well be thatevents unfolded in whichthese far ancient societies, or aspects of them, becamedenser and denser until theyfell vibrationally into three-dimensional reality.Once here, the temptations andlimitations of such dense vibrations with all thephysical sensations availablebecame like an addiction to the consciousness thatexperienced it. The Italianphysicist Giuliana Conforto writes in FUH, Man'sCosmic Game:\"The human body is made of physical matter, the solid state of the substance,that iscosmic Thought, Information. The many parallel universes are thereforedifferent modesof thinking or software: either rigid, dual, typical of the solidstate, or more fluid andthus tuned to cosmic oneness. 'Falling' in temperaturefrom a hotter parallel universe,the human body underwent a phrase transitionthat solidified the substance andstiffened its modes of thinking. If it is so,we can understand why it may be possible forthe human body to 'rise' again, asmany hermetic traditions suggest too.\"11There are those who believe that when our physical body dies, ourconsciousnessreturns to some wonderful heavenly realm. Personally, I don'taccept that this392Children of the Matrixhappens as a matter of course. Death is no cure for ignorance and when we leavethisworld as the physical body dies, we gravitate to where our consciousness isfocused.It's our vibrational state that decides where we can go. In other words,we do. If weare the embodiment of pure love, we will peel off our outer shells,the Russian dolls,and our consciousness becomes that spark of pure love thatpermeates all existence.If we are still seriously stuck in the illusion, whichthe vast majority of people are, wewill perhaps get no higher than the astralrealms because our vibrational state willhold us there. When Satanists do dealswith demonic entities and sign contracts inblood with them, it is a vibrationalcontract. In return for demonic manipulation togive them power and all that theywant in this world, the Satanist agrees that theirdemons should own them whenthey leave this physical realm. When they leave thebody, Satanists move the tinyvibrational distance into the lower astral or fourthdimension, that's all. Themore souls (energy) of that malevolent nature thesedemonic entities can packinto their frequency range, the more powerful thevibrational prison thatsurrounds or interpenetrates the third dimension. Those whoare not Satanists,but still firmly controlled by the illusion, will leave the physicaland move tohigher levels of the astral frequency range and experience anotherillusion. I ampersonally convinced that most people on Earth are trapped in a cycleofreincarnating between the astral illusion and the physical illusion and backagain.In the end people can become so detached vibrationally from theirhigherdimensions that they are virtually operating as a completely separatefragment or\"lost soul\". That's the situation the lower fourth-dimensionalentities have workedso vociferously to create. Consciousness incarnates fromhigher realms to try toexpose the scam and the illusion that underpins it, butmany of these people also gettrapped in the illusion and forget why they came.It's a tough school, this one,because the vibrations are slow and therefore theenergy is dense. But when we canfocus our consciousness and reality in thehigher realms while occupying a physicalbody, we ground that higher-dimensionalconsciousness (energy) in this density andraise both awareness of the illusionand the frequency of the Earth’s vibrational field.When we have reached thathigher state, we are in this world, but not of it.So what does all this mean? We are in a low vibrational prison - the Matrix -andliving a daily illusion. It is the illusion that holds the whole showtogether, and theIlluminati have set up the media, science, education, religion,medicine, finance,and business, the whole grotesque system, to assault ourconscious andsubconscious minds with messages designed to programme the illusiondeeper anddeeper into our sense of reality. If we buy that, and all but a fewpeople do, we willnever get out and break free. The bottom line of all bottomlines of the Illuminatiagenda is the manipulation of humanity's imagination ofitself. Without that, therest of their agenda becomes impossible. I will makesome suggestions in the finaltwo chapters about how we can get the hell out ofhere, but our choice is very clear:to exist in the Great Illusion or to live inthe Great Infinity.Put another way: do we want the prison or the paradise? If it's the paradise,wehave some work to do.The Matrix393SOURCES1 Giuliana Conforto, Man's Cosmic Game (Edizioni Noesis, 1998), pp 11 and 122 Ibid, p 443 Dr. Douglas Baker, The Opening Of The Third Eye (Aquarian Press,Wellingborough,England, 1977), p 134 Quoted in Our Haunted Planet, p 1795 Bill used this line in many of his stage performances and videos6 See http://www.angelfire.com/ut/branton and http://www.reptilianagenda.com/7 http://www.telepath.com/skipsil/trirept.html8 Ibid9 The Ultimate Alien Agenda, p 6510 Quoted in Our Haunted Planet, pp 170 and 17111 Man's Cosmic Game, p 24CHAPTER 19gatekeepers\"The Matrix is a system, Neo, and that system is our enemy.

Of course, theconsciousagents of the Illuminati are placed in the positions of economic,business, media,political, legal, and military power to hold this mental andemotional sheep-pentogether. But they could not do this alone. They have tomanipulate humanity tosuppress itself. Humanity is like the security guard. Heoften doesn't know whathe is guarding or why he is doing it. He is an automaton,just doing whatever he istold to the letter and never for a moment consideringthe possibility that he shouldthink for himself and interpret a situation on itsmerits. It is black and white, noshades of grey. Rules is rules, mate. Every\"plugged\" person is an enemy, orpotential enemy, of freedom, but some are morearrogantly enthusiastic about it, or,in other words, more profoundly entrappedby the illusion than others. If we aregoing to break out of this vibrationalprison cell we all need to resign immediatelyfrom our role as agents of thethought police. For us to be free, we must seteveryone else free. To cease to bea sheep, we must cease to be a sheepdog. Howsimple that is, yet how difficult itseems to be for humans in their present hypnoticstate. But we can only stopbeing a sheep dog when we realise that we are a sheepdog and we are so blind toour own desire for control over other people's lives and394395thoughts. Ask anyone if they believe in freedom and all except a tiny minoritywillsay \"Yes\". Its not something that people like to be seen to be against. Notgoodstreet cred. So we all believe in freedom by reflex action, but do we liveit byeveryday action? You have got to be kidding. If we did, this book, and allmyothers, would have no reason to be published. We would already be freeandreconnected to multi-dimensional paradise.Who are the gatekeepers of the Matrix? Who are the prison warders, theborderguards of the Great Illusion? We are.The gatekeeper parents, partners, and priestsWe want our children to live in a free world, right? Then why don't we evenallowthem to live in a free home? Inter generational conditioning by parents oftheirchildren is one of the greatest of all gatekeeping activities. If theparent is aChristian, Muslim, voter for this political party or that, a racist,a sexist, workingclass, middle class, upper class, whatever, that is theconditioning theyoverwhelmingly insist on imposing upon their offspring. Thechild is conditionedto be a reflection of the parent and the pressure to be likethem can be enormous.The very idea that a vehement Christian or Muslim, or Jew,or Hindu, wouldrespect their child's right from birth to reach their ownconclusions withoutpressure to conform to their parents' beliefs, would beutterly abhorrent to suchpeople. Indeed most could not begin to comprehend sucha level of mental andemotional respect for their child's uniqueness, and freedomof thought andexpression. As I said at the start of the book, I debated at theOxford Union with theformer Chief Rabbi of Great Britain and he could not seethe difference betweeninformation and indoctrination. \"How can I do the best formy children,\" he said,or words to that effect, \"If I do not bring them up tobelieve what is right?\" No,Rabbi, what you believe is right. That's notinforming them of your view; it isindoctrinating your beliefs while suppressingand discrediting all alternativeversions of reality. It's mind control. Priests,rabbis, bishops, popes, and all the restof the long-frock brigade areprofessional gatekeepers working for those whocontrol the Matrix. Yet most ofthem are so mesmerised by the Matrix themselves,they have no idea that this isso. It is the same with the vast majority of parents.It goes further. Parents, conditioned by their parents, who were conditionedbytheirs, and so on, often decide what is best for their children even afterthey leavethe nest. I met a guy once in his 60s who was still being destroyedinside by theguilt that he did not achieve what his father wanted for him. Wellbollocks to thefather, I say. If he is such a parental dictator and emotionalmanipulator, he deservesto be friggin' disappointed. Do him good. But how manyof us don't do what wereally want to do in our lives because we fear what ourparents will say or becausewe don't want to disappoint them? Stuff that. Theyeither respect our right to bewho we are and express who we are or they can goon their way. Their choice. Thisis so important to breaking free of the web offear, guilt, and the need for approvalthat dominates so many child-parentrelationships and continues long after thechild becomes an adult. They are notour parents, in truth, anyway, except396Children of the Matrixaccording to Matrix reality. They are the ones who seeded our physical formandwith whom we spent our formative years. They are close by genetics inthisphysical realm, but they may not be at all close when it comes tovibrationalconnection. Many are, but they don't have to be. An obsession withdoing nothingto upset our parents or the people around us is the Matrixmentality, a key part ofthe prison that keeps us in line.It is the same with our wives or husbands, partners, and children. Observeyourown situation. How many people around you, people you love and care for,aresuppressing what you want to do with your life because you are concerned bytheway it will make them feel? It is a mental and emotional Alcatraz. It canturn arelationship into a prison sentence, and a marriage and family into aprison cell.Don't get me wrong here. I am not talking about being violentbecause you fancy it,or making their lives miserable for the sake of it. No, no.I mean to express whatyou are, say what you think, live your uniqueness, withoutsuppressing yourselfbecause those around you will not like or understand thereal you. It means to stopliving what they think you should be; the blueprintfor what they want you to be;and start being the you that you really are. Ifthey can't handle that, that's theirproblem and they should find someone elsewho will suit them better. And if theycan't, and insist that you suppress thereal you to suit them, they are unpaid,unaware gatekeepers for the Matrix.But it goes both ways this. Everyone, or almost everyone, is concerned abouttheir own freedom, but what about the freedom of others? How many times a daydoyou impose your will, your reality, on those around you? I spoke at somefinancial conferences that were designed to promote \"freedom\". All you had todowas stand on the stage and talk about freedom and you were sure of wildapplause.But most of those clapping their hands, and the organisations thatpromoted theconferences, did not want freedom at all. It's the last thing theywanted. Theycouldn't handle freedom. Most didn't know what it was and those who had someideawere horrified at its implications. The organisers were terrified that Iwoulduse the \"E\" word, extraterrestrials. Even the \"F\" word would have been lesslife-threatening to them. They couldn't care less if the extraterrestrialinformation wastrue or not. They couldn't care less if anything I said was trueor not. So long as itdidn't upset the audience, which the organisations were using and manipulatingmercilessly to make their fortune, that was OK. So long as the people likedwhatthey heard, who gave a shit if it was true? Once I began to question in mybooks theexistence of Jesus, sections of the audience who had previously givenme a standingovation for exposing the conspiracy, began to demand that I beremoved from thespeakers list. My crime? Expressing a different view to theirs.I am sure many ofthem are still attending, still being manipulated, and still giving standingovationsto the kind of freedom they really want - the freedom to hear someonesupporttheir own beliefs and the freedom to suppress anyone else who has adifferent view.In fact, that is the \"freedom\" that most people want. I observedanother financialgroup based in Arizona, and heard them talk about freedom fromthe system,freedom of expression, and all the usual stuff they think will pull people intotheir397web. They said the organisation was created to promote freedom when it wasmerelycreated to make as much money as possible. Fine, if that's your thing, butbehonest about it and don't bullshit me with tearful, carefully rehearsed,garbageabout how you are doing it to free the people. Free your overdraft, morelike.Funnily enough, it turned out to be one of the most dictatorial,vicious,unscrupulous, manipulating organisations you could ever see and awashwithmonumental purveyors of bullshit. Both of these \"financial\" operations andmost oftheir audience are gatekeepers masquerading as promoters of freedom andthat,perhaps, makes them the most deluded of all.The greatest gift we can give our children is the freedom to think forthemselves,even if, outrage of outrage, we don't agree with what they believe;to encouragethem to question, read, and come to their own conclusions; torespect their right tobe different without feeling the need to impose ourbeliefs because we know best.Of course, it has to be pointed out when theirbehaviour is unfairly andunpleasantly affecting others, but that's not what 1mean here. 1 mean to encouragethem to free their minds and be open to allpossibilities. Far too many parents aremore concerned with what theirneighbours, friends, and the teachers will think oftheir children, rather thanwhat the children think of themselves and the world. Weneed to set the childrenfree to think the officially unthinkable and question at everyturn theofficially unquestionable. If we can't set our children free, we fall onourarses at the very first step on the road to global freedom.In our personal relationships, we need to set each other free of the blueprintsforwhat a relationship must be. We are imprisoned by blueprints andexpectations,and who creates the blueprints? The system, the Matrix, does. Oncewe have anexpectation and a mental design for what constitutes \"love\", arelationship, oranything at all, we are imprisoned by that thought form. Itbecomes the focus fromwhich everything is judged. If the relationship takesanother expression we aredisappointed; it might be perfect for our personalgrowth and evolution, but it isoutside the blueprint, so it can't be right. \"Youdon't kiss me and hold my hand likethe couple across the street. \" Well that'sprobably because I am not the coupleacross the street, I am me. Ironically,blueprint relationships are usually the mostfragile and superficial because theyare often based on image and posturing ratherthan substance. Relationships areeverything. The relationships between planetsand stars, water and air, hot andcold, thought and energy, are constantly creatingand changing the world aroundus. Relationships are literally what makes creationpossible and humanrelationships are an expression of this. It is the main way thatwe learn andgrow, but if blueprint rules are laid down on how relationships shouldbe and thedirection they must go, we are immediately building barriers to allotherpotential experience and, therefore, greater understanding. The flow oflife leads usto what we need to experience and who with, and the flow comes fromwithinourselves. Once we lay down the way it must be, or else, we arechallenging thatflow, which may have other plans for us. This creates a battlebetween the innerflow and the outer, conscious, blueprint demands, and there isalways only onewinner in such conflicts. I love to be hugged and held andoperating in harmonious398Children of the Matrixsituations, but there is so much more for relationships to offer than theclassicblueprints and often the experiences they present to us are not very nice. Butif thelove is truly there between two people they can survive and growenormously fromthose challenges because whatever happens nothing will break thatbond. True loveis not conscious, it is beyond the bounds of the conscious mind. It is alsobeyondwords. I think we have lost touch with what love really is. Instead weoften createan illusion of love and confuse it with purely third-dimensionalblueprinting.Among the New Age mentality, hugging people is part of the persona,theblueprint, the mental and emotional uniform to show that you are a \"lovingperson\". But I have seen many in the New Age hugging people as a public showwhile saying how much they hate their guts once they have gone. I have knownmany relationships of the \"kissy, kissy, my little cherub\" variety, which, onthesurface, have been perfect matches. \"Oh what a wonderful couple, they are soinlove, it's obvious, isn't it?\" Yet at the first sign of a problem betweenthem, therelationship falls apart because it is built on sand. They can't handleit once theblueprint is breached and you also find, talking to them after the break-up,thattheir lovey-dovey-go-through-the-motions relationship was a cover for thelack of adeep inner connection that nothing could destroy. I have heard that twopeople in arelationship should never say goodbye on any occasion without saying\"I loveyou\". Really? Just say it now: \"I love you.\" See how easy it is? You don't havetomean it, you don't have to feel it, you just have to say it. How many people saythose words every day, just to get what they want? And how many don't followthatblueprint, yet feel an enormous love for another person and show it in otherways? I saw a quote once that said: \"Just because I don't love you the way youwantme to doesn't mean that I don't love you with everything I have.\" The needto hear\"I love you\" all the time or experience constant public shows ofaffection can saymore about that person's own insecurity than a statement about another's loveforthem. If you had to make a choice, would you rather have a blueprintrelationshipthat collapses when the going gets tough or one of real substance in which youknow your partner will be in the trench with you, no matter what, even if theydon't say \"I love you\" every five minutes? Sometimes you can have both, andthat'sgreat if that's what you want, but there are other infinite expressions oflove thatdon't come with a set of rules and regulations.I was married to Linda for 29 years and although we are no longer husbandandwife, we are still very close on a deep level, far beyond the nonsensicalidea that tobe officially \"together\" you have to sign a piece of headednotepaper. We willremain so forever because our mutual and deeply painfulexperiences since 1991have exploded all blueprints and expectations into tinyfragments. She knows I willalways be there when needed, no matter what, nomatter where, and vice-versa. If ithad been a blueprint relationship it wouldhave been over in an instant ten yearsago. But it wasn't and it isn't, and thatis why it has endured and grown, eventhough the form it takes may have changed. The experiences we have endured,shared, and overcome have made us stronger, wiser, more enlightened people. And,most importantly, more individual people, expressing a far greater innerstrength399and sense of confidence and respect for who we are. This has been thewholeevolutionary reason for what we have experienced: to make usemotionallystronger and free as our own unique selves without the need to haveanyonealongside as an emotional crutch. I leaned on Linda emotionally for a longtime. 1don't now. She leaned on me. She doesn't now. We are all being challengedtobecome whole people and we attract the relationships that help us to do that.Suchrelationships rarely follow the conditioned blueprints. It's funny how weuttersparkling truths without realising in our every-day words and phrases. Likewhenwe talk of our partners as \"our other half\". That's what they are for mostpeople, oras much of the \"other half\" as they can find, anyway. In mostrelationships, thepartner expresses an energy that we have not accessed withinourselves. This iswhy opposites can so powerfully attract. The male is balancedby the female, whoin turn is balanced by the male, or again, by as much as theycan manage. We areaccessing such a fraction of ourselves that we need a partnerto make the balanceand form some kind of \"whole\" - our other half.1 wrote earlier about how, when two polarities, male and female, arefusedtogether it creates a third force of fantastic creative potential that cantake usvibrationally out of Matrix mode. For this reason, the Illuminati haveworkedfuriously over thousands of years to keep male and female apart andmaintain theduality. Most relationships do not create the necessary vibrational\"wholeness\" andfusion to trigger- the third force in all its magnificence. Sorelationships as we knowthem today are not a problem to those in control. Infact, male-female relationshipsas they are currently perceived are a wonderfultool of the Matrix. Even two halvesbecoming one is not the ultimate goal on ourFreedom Road - it is the one becomingone. It is believed by some that the ideal\"spiritual\" partnership is two polaritiesbecoming one whole with male and femalecreating the third force when twocompatible people come together. I went alongwith that for a while, but not anymore. It is only half the story. Two halvesbecoming one still leaves the twoindividuals concerned as less than wholepeople. We are everything. Just becausewe live in male bodies doesn't mean wedon't have as much potential femaleenergy within us as a woman. At the level ofconsciousness, we are both male andfemale. Just because we live in female bodiesdoesn't mean we don't have as muchpotential male energy within us as a man. Butour conditioned roles within theMatrix are designed to pressure theconsciousness in a male body to suppress itsfemale aspect - \"macho man, big boysdon't cry\" - and the consciousness in afemale body to suppress its male aspect -\"little girls play with dolls and big girlslook after the kitchen\".What we are being challenged to do here is for all of us to access all ofus.Therefore to become balanced \"wholes\" within ourselves without the need tofindan external \"other half\". The third force then manifests within all of us,andrelationships are the interaction of two whole people and not two halvesseekingexternal balance. Those relationships are based on the mutual respect ofeachpartner for the other's wholeness and individuality. If they don't fulfilthe blueprintthen fine because whole people do not want a relationship with ablueprint. They400Children of the Matrixwant to be with another vibrant, whole, individual, unique, expression of allthat is.And if they don't kiss you at the door or say \"I love you\" every timethey leaveyour presence then who gives a shit because that is them being them.It doesn'tmean they don't love you in their own unique way. Blueprints are suchafoundation of the Matrix and without them one of its key structures wouldcollapse.Relationships as they are currently perceived, desired, and demanded,serve theMatrix magnificently because they suppress what is necessary for thepartners toreach wholeness within themselves. Once whatever they need to expressorexperience on that journey starts to affect their partner in ways they don'tlike, thepressure is applied, internally and externally, to suppress thatexperience and stayin the prison cell. If this attitude does not stop, theMatrix will continue to holdtogether for as long as the attitude prevails. Itwill always produce the gatekeeperrelationship in which each partner keeps theother in mental and emotionalservitude while calling it love and the idealrelationship.There is another aspect to this crazy little thing called love. People talkabout loveall the time, but what is it, what does it mean? \"Love is never havingto say you'resorry\" is one definition I have heard. Yet others think that notsaying sorry is a reallyundesirable trait. So one person's definition of love isanother's definition of beingunloving. Which one is right? It depends on yourblueprint and the perspective fromwhich you are observing. There is a differentdefinition of love for almost everyone onthe planet and that's because love isindefinable. It just is and expresses itself ininfinite ways, most of which weare not aware of in the Great Illusion. And somethingelse we need to ask: whichlevel of the person is expressing the love in a relationship?This physicalaspect of us is only a holographic projection into this frequency rangeby thehigher levels of who we are. Our physical level is the experiencer and thegiverof experience. It is not who we are. We are all that exists. Do we want arelationshipwith a holographic image according to a conditioned blueprint? Orone with themulti-dimensional consciousness of our partner, which will alwaysprovide theexperience - the love - that is necessary to open our hearts andminds to the truemagnitude of who we are? We might not like the experience, butfrom realms beyondthis world, it is given with love because it is what we needto set us free of theillusion. Do we want the comfortable, predictable,commitment of the cul-de-sac? Orthe unpredictable, no guarantees,roller-coaster-ride, the long and winding road thatleads us to multi-dimensionalfreedom? Those two standpoints will judge arelationship and \"love\" in verydifferent ways, and from very different wavelengthsand universes. When apartner, parent, child, whoever, gives us an experience wedon't like, and doesnot fulfil our blueprint of someone who loves us, we can getcaught in the Matrixbig time. How do we grow and evolve? Through experience. Allexperience, the goodand the bad, the pleasant and the unpleasant. In fact, we growfar moreprofoundly from the challenges than the easy rides. So who loves us most onahigher level, where it really matters? Those who present the challenges fromwhichwe grow and evolve, or those who fulfil our blueprints for an idealrelationship, lookafter us, take care of us, and shield us from responsibilityand challenge? Mmmm.Topsy-turvy world, isn't it? Nothing is what it seems.Gatekeeper teachersIt is crucial to the Illuminati agenda that their gatekeepers serve the causeincomplete ignorance of what they are doing. There is no greater example of thisthanthe \"professional\" classes like teachers, journalists, doctors,psychiatrists,politicians, scientists, bank staff, and so on. There areexceptions, of course there are,with the great and often brave people in theseprofessions who know the score andtry to do what they can within the wallsimposed by the system. What I am talkingabout here, however, is the general rulewithin which the exceptions have tooperate. The emergence of the \"education\"system has been hailed as a great stepforward in human society. But, like theInternet, it is a two-edged sword and theedge marked indoctrination is farsharper than the one marked enlightenment. Yes,\"education\" means that childrencan learn how to read, write, and understandnumbers to an extent. That's a goodthing on a basic level. But the \"education\"system is a manipulator's dream. Ifyou wanted to turn out adults who thought asyou wanted them to think and saw theworld in a way that suited your plans, whatwould be the ideal situation for you?It would be to take them as small children,three and four years of age, and havecontrol of what they are taught for at least fivedays a week throughout theirchildhood and often into their 20s. You could not askfor a better structure ofindoctrination than that. And that's what they have. AsAlbert Einstein said:\"The only thing that interferes with my learning is myeducation.\" We don't haveeducation. We have the indoctrination of a belief system- the belief system ofthe Matrix. Teachers are the gatekeepers of the developingmind, telling childrenwhat is reality, what is history, what is true and false. Andthese teachers,overwhelmingly, have no idea that this is what they do.Look at how a teacher is produced. First they have to do very well in examsintheir own school and university life. Put more bluntly, they have to besponges forthe system's version of truth and reality, and be able to expressthat accurately on anexam paper. Then they go off to teacher training collegeand they learn how toindoctrinate their pupils with the same \"truth\" and\"reality\" that has beenprogrammed into them. Incidentally, you also have to be agood sponge at schooland university and pass the system's examination of yourconditioning, before youqualify to go on to learn how to be a doctor, scientist,journalist, and, more oftenthan not, politician. Those who are good at passingthe system's exams are merelyconfirming their level of indoctrination and it isa mental prison cell that stays intactin most people for their entire physicallife. Children and young people who dotheir own research, think for themselves,question, and offer a different reality to theindoctrinated \"norm\", do not passtheir exams and are called \"a disruptiveinfluence in the classroom\". Oh you meanthey ask difficult questions? Right,gotcha. Much of what young people are taughtabout politics, history, banking,business, science, and all the rest, isprovable baloney. But it's what the Illuminatiwant you to believe and that's allthat matters. Teachers work to something called acurriculum, a word meaning, inthe Icke dictionary of terminological translation:\"The version of reality wewant the masses to believe.\" This is decided by the top ofthe \"educational\"pyramid and dictated to all below. Either the teachers follow the402Children of the Matrixcurriculum or they consider their other career options. This is the way that allofthese \"professional\" classes are kept in line and any rebels are weeded out.Teachersteach what they are told to teach, or else; journalists write within theboundsdictated by the editor, or else; the editor edits within the boundsdictated by theowner, or else; scientists give a version of reality andpossibility within theboundaries of official \"science\", or else. Doctors treatpatients within the strict,scalpel or drug, dictates of the medicalestablishment, or else. So it goes onwherever you look. The few at the topdictate and the rest do what they are told todo. It is the same with theteacher-pupil relationship as we come further down thispyramid. Children findout very early on that life is a lot simpler if you don'tquestion what you hearand just accept it.I instinctively knew from an early age that schools were the places wheretheclones of tomorrow were honed and produced. I was, therefore, a rebel fromthestart. I have never passed a major school exam in my life (and never takenone),never went to college or university, and have done all my learning in mytime andon my terms. Teachers are crucial gatekeepers for the Illuminati, notleast because,in my experience, the vast majority are so stunningly uninformedabout the widerworld. Most only know what they are conditioned to know.Well-informedteachers, journalists, scientists, doctors, and politicians, arethe last thing theMatrix wants. Being informed of what is really going on is nota good career move.Those teachers who are informed and do understand that thesystem is anindoctrination machine, will tell you the consequences for trying tochallenge it.The \"education\" system is a well-oiled conveyor belt that sucks invirgin minds atone end and turns out programmed adults at the other. There aresome whosurvive with their thinking processes still intact, but very few. Forthe rest theironly hope is to spend their adult lives de-programming themselvesfrom theindoctrination that \"educated\" them. In the USA, and other parts of theworldcome to that, parents who are already indoctrinating their children athome, areworking a second or third job, saving, and going without, to ensurethat theirchildren get a good indoctrination at college and university. Thewheels go roundand round as everyone plays their part in indoctrinating everyoneelse andkeeping them in the pen. It is so brilliantly done that they genuinelybelieve theyare doing their best for their children.Gatekeeper police and soldiersPolice, the military, government officials, and \"civil servants\" are at thefront line inthe imposition of Illuminati policy on the global population. WhatI am about todescribe is \"democracy\", a word that has become interchangeablewith \"freedom\"in the newspeak of Illuminati propaganda. I wonder if you thinkthis sounds likefreedom: first you elect a government by voting once every fouror five years andchoosing between two or more masks on the same Illuminati face.Thesegovernments then do almost whatever they like in their period in office andthere'snothing that can be done within the \"law\" to remove them until anotherfarcicalelection is upon us in which we can, if we want \"change\", elect anotherIlluminati403mask. Governments pass laws in which you have had no say and, because oftheirmajority in Parliament or Congress among the voting fodder that passfor\"politicians\", they can get virtually any legislation into \"law\". Once thathappens,yet more fodder-people - gatekeepers - appear on the scene. We call thempoliceand soldiers. Theirs is not to reason why, theirs is just to do or die.You are not paidto think, just to implement the law and follow orders. We payfor the use of yourbody and your trigger finger, not your brain, soldier. NowFIRE! YES, SIR! If it werenot so tragic, it would be hilarious. Little boysplaying soldiers at the expense ofother people's lives.Hey, soldier, you left a pile of bodies there in a country you only arrived inyesterday. What did they do to you?\"They're the enemy, Sir.\"Have you ever spoken to them?\"Of course not. Sir.\"Never considered that they are just like you, with families and children, andaspirations to build a better life in the face of the bloody dictator your armyhasbeen flown in to defend?\"No, Sir.”Ever read anything about this country you're in?\"No, Sir.\"Then how do you know they're your enemy?\"My commanding officer told me. Sir.”And who told him?\"His commanding officer, Sir.\"And who's the chief commanding officer at the top of this heap?\"The President, Sir.\"And who commands the President?\"The people, Sir, this is a democracy.\"404Children of the MatrixHow many of \"the people\" just told you to kill that pile of bodies?\"Well, one, Sir.\"And who was that?\"My commanding officer, Sir.\"And who told him?(See above).The training in the military is pure, classic, mind control. It is designed tobreak thespirit of a recruit to the point where he will do, by reflex action,whatever he is told todo, whenever and wherever, he is told to do it. The moreelite the regiment, the moreprofound is the mind control. The training for theelite of the British military like theSAS and the Parachute Regiment, or theDelta Forces or Green Berets in the UnitedStates, is designed to produce roboticpsychopaths because that is the mentality mostsuited to requirements. Thinkingin the military is another bad career move. It is theseclones of someone else'scommands that are used to implement the decisions, oftenon innocent people, ofthe Illuminati networks operating within global politics, theUnited Nations, andNATO. They are perhaps the nearest thing to zombies that youcould imagine. Thatis not to say that out of uniform there are not intelligent,thinking, peopleamong them. There are. But once the military garb is upon theirperson, theirprogramming locks in and the gatekeepers take their positions at thecheckpoint.If soldiers, and others in uniform, refused to follow orders without askingforjustification, the Illuminati could not survive. Then the dog would wag thetail,instead of, at present, the other way around.The police are the same. It is not that we don't need the police in today'ssociety, itis that we need them to think for themselves and assess situations ontheir merits,and not implement the law to the letter no matter what. There aresome who try todo that, but the system constantly discourages them, as it doeswith teachers who telltheir pupils to think and question. Many world policeforces have \"quotas\" tomaintain every month and so we have the patheticsituation in which more driversare ticketed for speeding at the start of themonth to get them off to a good start andat the end of the month when they aretrying to complete their quota. It's calledjustice. We need the police to askthemselves if a course of action is fair in thecircumstances, even if the lawinsists that rules are rules. Otherwise they are justrobots to another'scommand. Thinking for yourself is called \"insubordination\". Yousee this on aminor level when cars are ticketed for illegal parking even though theyare notcausing a problem and there are reasons why they were there. We havereached thepoint now where parking a car in an \"illegal\" area for two minutes cancost you£50 and, if it is clamped, far more than that. To some, the cost ofbeingundamped is a week's wages that should be putting food in their family'sbellies40Sinstead of in the pockets of vicious \"security\" firms who win the clampingcontracts.The more they clamp, the more they collect. This is another of thesystem's littletricks. You make sure that those who serve you and implement youragenda benefitfinancially from doing so. In this way, you divide and rule thepopulation by settingenforcer and victim at war with each other and making theenforcer benefit from thevictim's plight. Why is it that dictators always ensurethat their army is well lookedafter? The explosion of laws and regulations andof signs all round us telling to doand don't, are designed to bombard our mindswith a constant flow of orders andcommands. This programmes the subconsciousinto weary submission to followingorders and opens people to react roboticallyto another's instructions. If you driveinto your town or city, park the car, andwalk through the streets, you will beastonished at how many times you areinstructed what to do.People like soldiers, police, wheel clampers, and government officials allgleantheir power over others from the \"law\". This \"law\", they know, will backthem everytime, even though to implement it in certain circumstances may beinsane. That's thepoint you see. The \"law\" has become the god of society. Lawsare passed by\"elected\" dictatorships, implemented by unthinking yes-men, anddefended by thegeneral population who are conditioned to \"respect the law\" andbe \"a law-abidingcitizen”. What more obvious prison can we live in than to seelaws passed in whichthe people have had no say, and those same people to believethat, even though thelaw is ludicrous or fascist, they must respect it? Peopleshould only respect the lawwhen the law respects the people. The \"law\" is just apiece of paper that results froma group of mostly uninformed or corruptpoliticians voting for its introduction.That's all it is. If the Suffragetteshad respected the law that denied women the votein Britain and had they notprotested and chained themselves to official buildings(against the law) womenwould not have won the right to vote when they did. Hadthe peoples of Serbia andthe countries of Eastern Europe respected their laws theywould still live inopen dictatorships. The very people who say we must respect thelaw would jumpfor joy if the Chinese people broke their laws and overthrew theCommunistregime. What hypocrisy. What self-delusion. The only differencebetween theChinese dictatorship and the \"democratic\" dictatorships at the level of\"law\" isthat one is an open dictatorship and the other masquerades as freedom. Thepoliceand the military are front-line gatekeepers and, like traffic wardens andcops,wheel clampers, security guards, and all the other uniformed enforcers,they are themost obvious examples of the masses policing themselves. They thinktheyadminister the law when the law administers them. They do not answer to whatisright and just in given circumstances, they answer to their masters whointroducethe \"law\" and, in truth, the masters of their masters, the Illuminati.Gatekeeper \"scientists\"The foundations of \"science\" were created by the Francis Bacon-inspiredRoyalSociety in London. This \"science\" claims that we come from oblivion, have ashortphysical \"life”, and then return to oblivion. Even by its own officialhistory theRoyal Society was created by Freemasons - people like the Illuminatiagent,406Children of the MatrixBenjamin Franklin. Another inspiration was Isaac Newton, a Grand Master ofthatelite Illuminati secret society, the Priory of Sion, which manipulates onbehalf of theMerovingian bloodline. Newton, like the founders of the RoyalSociety, knew thatmuch of what official \"science\" tells us to be true is uttergarbage. But that was theidea, to sell us a lie to keep us from the truth. It isfar easier to control people if theybelieve they are cosmic accidents, who comeinto existence merely by chemicalreactions and then go back to oblivion atdeath. It is much harder to control thosewho are aware of theirmulti-dimensional infinity. Also, what better way to hide thefact that we arecontrolled from another density than to have people believe thereare no otherdensities? The scientist, like the law, has become a \"god\", who is givenfreereign to pontificate about the great questions because he is a scientistandtherefore he should know. Modern scientists are mostly babes-in-arms whenitcomes to understanding the nature of life and existence, and yet theyarrogantlyinsist that only they know best. Worse, anyone inside or outside oftheir closedorder who questions their norms is subjected to hate campaigns ofridicule andvilification. Virtually every major scientific breakthrough,including the Earth beinga sphere, was first greeted with laugher, anger, ordenial, by the \"scientists\" of theday. Science is a fascist club in which allmembers must stay in line or have theirfunding and reputation destroyed. WhenImmanuel Velikovsky published hisbooks on the devastation he said was caused bythe Venus \"walk-about\", he wascastigated beyond belief because he dared toquestion the norm of conditioned\"scientific\" orthodoxy. The leading \"experts\"bombarded his publishers with lettersfull of bile and vitriol saying they wouldboycott the company if they did notwithdraw Velikovsky's book. As the companywas a publisher of official \"scientific\"textbooks, it once again put bucksbefore backbone and the rights were passed toanother publisher. The assistanteditor who suggested publishing Velikovsky's bookwas sacked. All this happenedbecause a different view to the scientific norm waspresented for people to see.John A. Keel wrote:\"In retrospect many of the anti-Velikovsky critiques read like the work ofderangedlunatics who had not even bothered to read the book they were attemptingtocriticise. They were against the book simply because it propounded ideas thatwerecontrary to the accepted theories of the day ...Above all they resented thefact thatthe book was very well written (most scientists are miserablewriters).\"1Alfred Wegener, a German meteorologist, died in 1930 after 15 years ofridicule,slander, and contempt from his peers and colleagues. His crime?Suggesting thatthe Earth once consisted of two landmasses, which split anddrifted apart over vastperiods of time to form the continents. He supported thisproposal with muchevidence, but because he was challenging the official \"norm\"he paid with anonslaught of character assassination. We call his theory today\"Continental Drift\".2The theme of what he said was correct! As Max Planck said:\"A new scientific truthdoes not triumph by convincing its opponents and makingthem see the light, butrather because its opponents eventually die, and a newgeneration grows up that is407familiar with it.\" What passes for science is a sick joke. Most of its effortsare notaimed at answering the big questions of existence because there is littlemoney orsponsorship in that. Science is geared to finding a new drug orindustrial techniquethat will generate a fortune for its funders. It's amoney-making machine and notinspired by an open-minded spirit of discovery. As aCongressional Committeeestablished as far back as the 1950s, those funders of\"scientific\" research in USuniversities, the tax-exempt foundations like theRockefeller Foundation, weredictating what the outcome of that research would be before it had evenstarted!!Without such an agreement, the funding was not handed over (see ...AndTheTruth Shall Set You Free). This policy is to suppress an undesired outcomebecause,in Carl Sagan's words: \"All inquiries carry with them some element ofrisk.There is no guarantee that the universe will conform to our predispositions.\"The whole \"scientific\" system is structured to suppress knowledge, notadvanceit, because the Illuminati is desperate for us to remain in ignorance ofwhowe are and the nature of life. If enough people knew the truth, their gamewould be up.Scientists, and their offshoot, the medical profession, are some of the mostconcrete-minded of the gatekeepers. They are also some of the most importantbecause they suppress the nature of multi-dimensional existence and that isguaranteed to keep us in the Matrix. They are feted as experts and yet they are,likeso many teachers, journalists, and politicians, astonishingly uninformed.Theirwhole structure is designed to keep them compartmentalised in their \"speciality\"sothey are partial masters of one trade and jack of none. Only when we connectthedots can we begin to see the picture, but most scientists spend their entirecareersspecialising on one dot. In the UK, one of the most infamous gatekeepersin myexperience is one Dr Susan Blackmore, who is constantly wheeled out by themediato dismiss any claims of the \"paranormal\". The more that people experiencesuchphenomena, the more ludicrous Dr Blackmore's \"explanations\" become. But,ofcourse, because she is an \"academic\" with a title she is seen as more crediblethanthe people actually having the experience. In the New Scientist magazine ofNovember 4th 2000, she was again given the freedom to rubbish all otherscientistswho say the mind and brain are not the same thing. The arrogance withwhich herpadlocked mind dismisses anything outside the official \"scientific\"norm is awonder to behold. We, the people, are the only ones who can break thisstranglehold on true science. We need to stop being impressed by titles andlettersafter someone's name and focus purely on the evidence. We are encouragedtobelieve that a scientist must know better than a \"layman\" by definition. He’sascientist, isn’t he? The track record of scientists talking complete cobblersis simplyenormous and goes back to the very start of the \"scientific method\".While I waswriting this book, an official report in the UK exposed how government\"scientists\"and \"experts\" had misled the British public for years about theso-called mad cowdisease being transmitted to humans through eating beef. Thescientists said itcould not be passed to humans and so safety measures were nottaken when anyidiot could see that the chances were high that it could. I remember saying soon a408Children of the MatrixBBC farming programme in 1989 when I was a spokesman for the British GreenParty.But the scientists knew best and people are still dying today as a result. Wasita layman or woman who came up with Thalidomide that led to so manyfundamentally deformed babies? No, it was scientists who said it was perfectlysafe.It would take a library to list all of the horrors that have resulted fromthese\"experts\" we call \"scientists\". But the masses go on believing themwithoutquestion and, until we stop, the Matrix will remain unexposed to the vastmajority.The motto of the new and true science should be the words of AlbertSchweitzer:\"...those who sincerely seek the truth should not fear the outcome\".Gatekeeper censorsCensorship is the life force of the Matrix. If you can stop the free flow ofinformation you are already well on the way to global control. If I emphasiseonething and suppress the opposing view, I am going to get large numbers ofpeopleto make imbalanced and inaccurate conclusions about a person, event,orpossibility. It is that simple. So if you are a censor, you are a gatekeeper,a prisonwarder for the Matrix. All censors are, by definition, arrogant beyondbeliefbecause they are saying that their view should be emphasised at theexpense ofanother. They believe they have the right to decide what others shalland shall nothave the freedom to hear. I can speak from experience because therehave beenendless attempts to censor my work. The closer I have gotten to the truth themoredetermined those attempts have become, especially since I began to speakandwrite about reptilian hybrid bloodlines. There have been attempts to closedownmy website, www.davidicke.com, and to stop me speaking at public meetingsandin the media. If what 1 am saying is so crazy and wrong, why the obsessionwithdenying me a platform?I'll give some examples of how fragile our freedoms really are. The attemptstosilence me started in the mid-1990s when I began to publish detailed accountsof theconspiracy in books like .. .And The Truth Shall You Free, since updatedmany times.On to the scene came a couple of naive and immature young\"journalists\" calledJohn Murray and Matthew Kalman. They had decided, on noevidence because theopposite is true, that I am \"anti-Semitic\". Their whole casewas that I quoted in aprevious book. The Robots' Rebellion, from the Protocolsof the Elders of Zion, which,I suggest, were planted by the Illuminati to blameit all on the Jews and for otherreasons. What the Protocols do, however, is reveal in detail the techniques thathavebeen provably used to advance the Illuminati agenda these past 100 yearsandmore. It mattered not to Kalman and Murray that I called them theIlluminatiProtocols, nor that I had emphasised in the book, and later ones, thatthis is not aJewish plot. It mattered neither that the first edition of ...AndThe Truth Shall Set YouFree was funded into existence by a Jewish friend ofmine. The vast majority ofJewish people have been victims of the Illuminati, notthe perpetrators. But mentiona few Jewish people, like Kissinger, theRothschilds, and the Bronfmans, among the95% I have named over the years who arenot Jewish, and you become \"anti-Semitic\". This has long been the prime and mosteffective tool used by the409Rothschilds and the Bronfmans to stop research into their activities, anditseffectiveness has allowed them to continue unexposed with the manipulationandabuse of Jewish communities as much as anyone. Some brave Jewish peoplearetrying to make these points also. Norman Finkelstein, whose own parentssufferedin the Nazi concentration camps, has published a brilliant and explosivebook calledThe Holocaust Industry (Verso Books, July 2000), which reveals howthe Jewish elitehave mercilessly exploited the Holocaust for their own financialends whiledenying the true victims their just compensation. There are somequotes from thisbook in Appendix III. Kalman and Murray, who appeared to thinkthey wereWoodward and Bernstein on the Washington Post exposing Watergate, haddecidedwhat I was and that's all that mattered to them. Don't let the truthspoil a goodstory, especially when there is money and kudos in it. Suddenlyarticles began toappear in national newspapers saying that I was an anti-Semite(which in fact reallymeans anti-Arab!). What no one was told was that all ofthese stories were eitherwritten by, or the \"information\" supplied by, the samedisastrous duo, MatthewKalman and John Murray. Their writings led to my eventsbeing banned by venues,so people could not hear how their lives were beingmanipulated, wars created,their freedoms removed, and staggering numbers ofchildren tortured, abused, andritually murdered. Well done chaps, great job.This was in the mid-1990s and I had demonstrations by the Anti-Nazi Leagueatsome of my events. My children have always been brought up to see racism ofanykind as silly and ridiculous. My daughter Kerry supported the Anti-NaziLeagueand wore their badge all the time. She threw it in the bin in outrage atwhat theywere saying about the father she knew found all racism obnoxious.Friends wentoutside to the protesters to ask them if any of them had read mybooks. They hadnot. Had they ever heard me speak? They had not. So why were they there?Because of what they had read in the papers and what they had been told bythosewho ran the Anti-Nazi League (see the earlier section about the soldier andthecommanding officer, because there is no difference). They were just a bunchofmindless pawns in a game they did not begin to understand, and they were sofullof their own sense of self-purity, they never considered that they werebehavingexactly like the Nazi fascists who systematically wrecked the publicmeetings ofthose in Germany who were trying to warn of the consequences ofHitler gettingto power. A policeman who attended one of my meetings because ofthedemonstrations said that he had policed the infamous and violentconfrontationsbetween the fascist National Front Party and the Anti-Nazi Leaguein the UK in the1970s. He said that it had been impossible to tell the two\"sides\" apart becausetheir attitude and behaviour had been precisely the same.Exactly. They areopposames. Just because people call themselves anti-fascistdoes not mean they donot express fascist behaviour. They are just not bright enough to see it. As aresultthey become an army of self-indulgent censors, gatekeepers for theIlluminati, andfascists who talk of stopping fascism. When the protestors wereinvited free ofcharge to come in and hear my talk and see for themselves, theyrefused. In doingso, they denied their right to be taken seriously. The samehappened at Swansea410Children of the MatrixUniversity, but then universities are the home of mind control andmentalconditioning, the breeding ground of what I call the \"Robot Radicals\". TheLondonSchool of Economics is a prime example.Kalman and Murray have long since left the scene. They suddenly went veryquiet.Maybe they realised they had been massively duped into duping others.Maybe thestory got old and the fees from the newspapers ran out. Who knows andwho cares?However, their nonsense was now in print thanks to newspapers likeThe SundayTimes, Guardian, Independent, and the London Evening Standard, all runby highlyintelligent people, you'll understand. Once in print, even if thesourcesthemselves may no longer believe it, the articles can be used to furthercensor whatpeople can hear. Enter stage right, far right from where I amsitting, one RichardWarman. Never heard of him? You are not alone. No one seemedto have heard ofhim until he decided to dedicate his life to preventing mespeaking and anyonehaving the opportunity to hear me anywhere in the world. No,you didn't mis-readthat. This man, by the way, works for the Canadian GreenParty, which condemnsthe censorship of freedom of speech! Just like David Taylorof the British GreenParty who also sought to have my events banned. The stenchof hypocrisy fills theair. Richard Warman is an official of the otherwiseinsignificant Ontario Green Partyworking out of Ottawa and Toronto, one of theglobal centres of the Illuminati andone of its key bloodlines, the Bronfmans.This is the gangster family behindUniversal Music, Universal Studios, the liquorgiant, Seagrams, and the forcebehind promoters of peace and love like theSatanic \"rock star\", Marilyn Manson.Warman has worked closely in his campaign ofvilification and censorship againstme with the Canadian Jewish Congress or CJC.This was formed and funded by thevery same Bronfmans. Just a coincidence,nothing to worry about. Warman wrotetriumphantly after denying my freedom ofspeech in Ontario in 1999:\"Now that the dust has settled over the recent attempted speaking tour byBritishhatemonger David Icke, I would like to offer a word of thanks on behalfof the GreenParty of Ontario to all those with whom we worked to oppose thisindividual'smessage of division and intolerance. Our concern with David Ickestems not onlyfrom the need for solidarity with the Jewish and other communitieswhom heattacks, but also because Icke attempts to gain credence for his beliefsfrom hisprior association with the British Green Party, without ever mentioningthat they havedisowned Icke and condemned his writings in no uncertain terms.The level ofsuccess that was achieved in informing the public and venues of thetrue nature ofDavid Icke's paranoid conspiracy theories was due in large part tothe tirelessefforts of Rubin Friedman and Karen Mock of the B'nai B'rith Leaguefor HumanRights [Rothschilds], Daniel Fine and Bernie Farber of the CanadianJewish Congress[Bronfmans], and Stacia Benovitch of Vaad Ha'lr, Ottawa. It wasextremelyencouraging to note that, apart from Hart House Theatre, every venuethat wascontacted made the decision that they were not willing to be a platformfor DavidIcke or his followers. Most impressive was the Bronson Centre in Ottawaand theOrder of Grey Nuns who run it. In a remarkable display of common sense,theyalways try to find out a little more about anyone who approaches them torentspace, and after a minimum inquiry on their own, they quickly decided theyweren'tinterested in having Icke as a guest in their facility.\"3This is a classic of its kind and typical of the thrust of the disinformationthat hascaused venues around the world to cancel my meetings. Note that he says that onevenue cancelled after a \"minimum inquiry\" of its own. Normally it is no inquiryatall and my freedom of expression and the freedom of the audiences to listen isdenied purely on this guy's say-so. He says the decision to cancel by the OrderofGrey Nuns was impressive. But, of course, like all disinformers, he fails tomentionthat they did not cancel because they said I was anti-Semitic. They didso because Iwas questioning the literal existence of \"Jesus\". He also fails tomention that theCanadian Jewish Congress was founded and funded by the Bronfmanfamily or thatB'nai Brith was founded and funded by the Rothschilds. It is thesame with theAnti-Defamation League. They were created by the Rothschilds to usethe label\"hatemonger\" and \"anti-Semite\" to prevent legitimate research intotheir grotesqueactivities. You have read this book. Many will have read previousones. Where am 1a hatemonger? Where do I condemn the Jewish people? I don't, andWarman knowsthat I don't, but then that's not the point is it? And what areWarman and Farber(the Bronfmans) seeking to do in this campaign of personalabuse? To get as manypeople as possible to hate me. So who are the realhatemongers here? But thefunniest part of all is the claim that I am trying to\"gain credence\" by emphasisingmy links with the British Green Party. Mr Warman,when you are trying to gaincredence, the last thing you do is emphasise anyconnections to the British GreenParty, never mind your own.The bile circulated by Warman and Farber (the Bronfmans) led to me beingstopped by both customs and immigration at Ottawa Airport and kept thereuntiltwo o'clock in the morning. Every item in my luggage was searched (glad Ibroughtthose dirty socks) and every piece of paper was read in pursuit of \"hatematerial\".They found nothing and in the end the officer-pawn involved could see it was allaset-up. But I still could not leave because some immigration technicality wasthenfound to hold me still longer. I was brought back the following lunchtime, thedayof my talk. They kept me there for hours and then asked me what time my talkwasdue to end that day. I said four o'clock. They let me go at four o'clock.More menand women in uniform, more gatekeepers of their own freedoms. Theytreated melike a criminal, as if all the propaganda by Warman and Farber (theBronfmans) wastrue. In other words they were mind controlled by a preconceivedidea, planted bysomeone else. There is nothing more powerful than the preconceived idea becauseonce that is implanted all you see is evidence to support your preconception.Thepower of that thought form so often unconsciously filters out informationthatwould show that your original perception was wrong.Richard Warman's abuse of my character devastated my meeting in Ottawa,where thevenue had to be changed again and again in the last 48 hours, and the oneatWindsor, Ontario, was cancelled. Together with the Bronfmans' Canadian Jewish412Children of the MatrixCongress and its vitriolic spokesman, Bernie Farber, and others, Warmanorganised ademonstration outside my talk at the Hart House Theatre at TorontoUniversity,which they had failed miserably to stop. A friend of mine, who wasmarried to aJewish man for many years, went outside to the demonstrators andasked them howthey knew I was anti-Semitic. It was the usual tale. \"Someone\"(Warman and Farber)had told them, they said. Had they read my books? No. Hadthey heard me speak?No. Would they be going inside to hear me now? No. Why?Because he is anti-Semitic! The only reason the Toronto talk went ahead wasbecause the head ofthe university refused to bow to pressure from Warman andFarber to block myfreedom of speech. He was a brave man because the pressure wasenormous. Soonafterwards, he left the university by \"mutual consent\". As aresult of the lies directedat me, the head of the Canadian Police Hate CrimesUnit was in the audience. Weshook hands afterwards and he had no problem with mytalk whatsoever. Warmanand Farber (the Bronfmans) never mention that. As Iwalked off the stage I was greetedby two agents of Canadian Immigration, whothreatened me with immediate arrest if Idid not agree to see an officer the nextmorning. When I did so, I was banned fromspeaking at any more events. Ask aCanadian if he or she lives in a free country andmost will say enthusiasticallythat they do. I was told that a teacher who had hosted ameeting for me lost hisjob as a result of this character assassination and, although thisturned out notto be correct, many people have had their reputations attacked fortheirassociation with me. The campaign continued when Warman flew across Canada(whopaid?) to gather support for a campaign to have my event in Vancouver bannedin thespring of 2000. Only a few mindless people were interested, but they stillmanaged,thanks to \"Farber's\" (the Bronfmans') influence in Toronto, to have themajor Canadianbook chain. Chapters, cancel a book signing; have invitations toappear on radiowithdrawn; and \"organised\" a rabble dressed as reptiles to rushinto a book signing atan independent bookshop and throw pies at me. Isn't it good to know that ourfreedoms are being protected by those with this scale of intellect and maturity?And while all this was unfolding, the children went on being abused,tortured, and sacrificed, and the wars and other horrors went on beingmanipulated, as Mr Warman and Mr Farber worked so ferociously to stop itbeingexposed. They have made their priorities very clear.The Vancouver event, attended by 1,200 people, only survived because it was atanindependent theatre. Any connection to a council, government, or major chainand it would have been pulled like so many before and since. Warman satthroughmy talk and in those more than six hours, he saw at first hand that I donot speakabout a Jewish plot at all and never even mention the word \"Jewish\" becausethere isno need, except to emphasise what a travesty of the truth Warman is seekingtopurvey. This talk can be seen on a video called From Prison To Paradise andyou cansee for yourself that what I am saying here is true. If Warman had simplybeenstupid and mis-guided, this is where it would have ended. But it didn't. Thatwas thepoint when Richard Warman's true motives became clear in my opinion. Thisguyhad an agenda and, given what small fry he is in Canada, it must, I believe,besomeone else’s agenda. To this very day he and Farber have refused to meet meface413to face or debate with me on the radio, though the opportunity has beenthere.Warman, from his home in eastern Canada, now seeks to prevent mespeakinganywhere on the planet and if anyone wants to know how easy it is tocontrol theworld, they should look at how easy it is to stop freedom of speechwithout movingfrom your desk. All he does is check on my website where I amspeaking and waitsuntil a few days before the event to ensure that there is notenough time to findanother venue. He then either rings the venue or sends them apackage claiming 1am anti-Semitic and will be blaming Jews for a globalconspiracy, something heknows from his own experience is not true. Ironically hequotes the articles in Britishnewspapers written or inspired by Kalman andMurray all those years ago. Perhapsmost sickening of all, he includes the factthat 1 am exposing famous people asabusers and sacrificers of children as areason why venues should not let me speak.A few tell him where he can place alarge object and they stand up for freedom ofspeech. Depressingly, many justpull the meeting on the basis of what he says. Justby doing this, in the courseof writing this book, Warman has, from eastern Canada,caused my events atLondon's Blackheath Concert Rooms, Stourbridge Town Hall,and the BurlingtonHotel in central Birmingham to be cancelled because the venuesbanned my talk.That's how easy it is. The venues refuse to discuss the situation andcould notcare less about the inconvenience and the cost, not least to the audience,andthey could care even less about the freedom of human expression. So long asitdoes not affect theirs, they don't give a damn. They do not have the intellecttounderstand that in banning my freedom of speech they are underminingthatfreedom for everyone by setting the precedent that it's OK to deny aperson's right toexpress views that don't suit you (even if you don't know whatthey are!).It has gotten so ludicrous that 1 was almost banned from speaking down theroadfrom where I live on the Isle of Wight in a theatre where I have appearedseveraltimes with no problem over many years. If 1 had not challenged thecouncil on localradio, they would have pulled the event, I am sure. The councileven sent a \"monitor\"to my talk with legal advice on hand and the authority tostop the event if 1overstepped their mark. Not naming people who abuse andsacrifice children appearsfar more important to them than the plight of the kidsthemselves. The monitor toldthe local newspaper that there was not a singlemoment when 1 said anything thatconcerned her in any way. This is what theCanadian Police Hate Crimes Unit said,who were set up specifically to make\"Anti-Semitism\" a criminal offence. So thatshould be the end of it, you maythink, but no. When the Burlington Hotel inBirmingham had the Warman treatmentthree weeks later they pulled the meetingand refused to even speak to me andexplain. They were given the chance to speak tothe council monitor on the Isleof Wight to see that what Warman was claiming fromthousands of miles away wasnonsense. But the Burlington Hotel did not want toknow. 1 understand that afterpressure they did contact the City Varieties Theatre inLeeds where I had spokenso successfully just two weeks earlier. But even though theBurlington was toldthat there were no problems whatsoever in Leeds, they bannedme all the same.They sent a very short fax, signed by a Sarah Small, the conferencesalesmanager. My talk had been cancelled, she informed me, because they thought it414Children of the Matrixwould damage the reputation of the hotel. It could not possibly do any moredamageto your \"reputation\", Ms Small, than the outrageous behaviour of you andyourcolleagues. Paul, the organiser of those British events, had worked hissocks off tomake them a success. He did it because he believed that the freedomof all of us isunder fundamental threat. But it was all for nothing because thecombination of onephone call or package from Richard Warman thousands of milesaway and patheticvenue managers in the UK is all takes to deny, this most basicof freedoms.Everyone concerned with these events is a gatekeeper for the Matrix. There aresofew on this planet who are not. People like Richard Warman and Bernie Farber(theBronfmans) know they are, that's the difference. Either that or their braincellcount must be dangerously low or their capacity for self-delusiondangerously high.But equally responsible are those Green Party members in Canadaand worldwidewho have been informed of what he is doing in their name and yetjust sit on theirhands and let him go on unchallenged. Those who stay silent andallow the bulliesto prevail are also gatekeepers by their inaction. I was aspokesman for the BritishGreen Party for a couple of years in the 1980s and it,and its equivalent around theworld, is the global headquarters of NavelContemplators Anonymous. That's whyWarman can use it to front his attempts tohave me silenced, including his bid tohave my Internet site taken down. Thiscaused us to move quickly to another serverto keep the information available. Itwas yet more time and effort used to overcomehis attempts at censorship thatcould have been exposing what is happening to somany people, not least tochildren. Apparently, Mr.Warman was outraged that hisactivities were beingexposed on the website and that his official Green Party officenumbers ande-mail addresses were published so that people whose freedom hehad denied couldlet him know what they thought. Richard Warman, gatekeeper tothe Matrix, wouldbe a legitimate dictionary definition for the word \"hypocrisy\".You will find thecontact numbers for the Canadian Green Party on the website. Atthe same timeWarman was having my events banned, the leader of the US GreenParty, RalphNader, was condemning the \"censorship\" that saw him denied a placein thetelevised presidential debates between Bush and Gore. Warman summed uphisattitude to freedom when he told a journalist of equal intelligence in theBritishIndependent On Sunday:\"He has taken all the conspiracy theories that ever existed and melded themtogetherto create an even greater conspiracy of his own. His writings may be thework of amadman, or of a genuine racist. Either way they are very dangerous.There is anunpleasant anti-Semitic undertone in his work [I thought I was a\"hatemonger\" openlycondemning Jewish people] that must be brought to publicattention. If he's unstablethen so are his followers, who hang on his everyword. What benefit can there be inallowing him to speak?\"If someone had spoken those words in the middle of the last century whilewearinga Nazi uniform, no one would have been surprised. If the speaker inWarman'sopinion is unstable, so, by definition, must be everyone who listens. Now415that is truly terrifying and truly, truly, dangerous. Think of the implicationsof thatstatement. The Soviet Union's psychiatric hospitals were filled withperfectly sanedissidents of that fascist/Communist system because the very sameattitudesexpressed there by Mr Warman were used to justify their imprisonment.And evenmore sinister: \"What benefit can there be in allowing him to speak?\" Thearroganceof that question beggars belief. No fascist in Nazi Germany, noCommunist in Chinaor the Soviet Union, could ever have said it better. But Istill respect his right toexpress his view. As Voltaire said: \"I may disagreewith what you have to say, but 1shall defend, to the death, your right to sayit.\" Pity that Mr Warman does not feelthe same about others. Green Party membersof the world, this man claims to speakfor you. How long are you going to sitthere in silence? While you do so, you areresponsible for everything this mandoes and says in your name. How many morevenue owners are going to have theirdecisions made by such a fundamental enemyof freedom? The \"journalist\" who wrotethat Independent On Sunday article, oneJason Cowley, just let those quotes passwithout comment while calling my work\"extreme\", \"dark\", and \"dotty\". If moredark and extreme words have ever beenspoken than those, then I haven't heardthem.But in one way, Richard Warman, this misguided holographic image, providesaservice to those who care about their freedoms. His behaviour has shownhowfragile those freedoms are and, indeed, what an illusion they are. The ideathat welive in a free world is self-delusion on a monumental scale. People inManchester,England, think they live in a free city and yet it has provedimpossible to find anyvenue there that will accept a booking for my talk. Thepeople of Brighton, onEngland's south coast, think they live in a free city andyet I have not been able tospeak there for many years because venues arethreatened with mass protests by the\"anti-fascists\" who tell them that they willnot be able to guarantee the safety of theaudience. The Brighton Art School liedto me when they said the police had orderedthem to pull my meeting there. Thepolice had done nothing of the kind. It was justan excuse because it is easierthat way when your backbone is made of jelly. Whenwe booked an alternative venueat Crawley, north of Brighton, the council asked tosee a video of what 1 wasgoing to say. They watched it and confirmed there was noproblem; 24 hours beforethe talk, they cancelled because an anonymous caller hadindicated thepossibility of violence against the audience if 1 was allowed to speak.Thecaller was an \"anti-fascist\", by the way. Another gatekeeper, another sheepdoginthe bewildered herd.Censorship of the Internet is next on the Illuminati agenda. The Internet isanIlluminati creation and only exists because of military technology. It hasbeen sold asa means of allowing the free flow of global information, but that isonly the cover. Thereal reason is that it allows for the easiest possiblesurveillance of personalcommunications through e-mails, and the websites visitedby individuals give theauthorities the opportunity to build a personality andknowledge profile of everyone.It's about control. Slowly, and now less thanslowly, the benefits of the Internet, thefree flow of views and information, arebeing targeted and the most prominentadvocates are... the Bronfmans! You aregoing to see an onslaught against Internet416Children of the Matrixfreedom, just as Richard Warman and his string-pullers targeted my ownsite.Censors never admit to being so. It's not good for the image, especially ifyou publisharticles calling for freedom of speech like the Green Party. Theywill always find away of justifying why they are defending freedom rather thandestroying it. But whenthe same criteria are applied to them, they scream like athree-year-old. Self-delusionis the very mind-state of the Matrix. Welcome tothe Matrix, Mr Warman.Gatekeeper \"journalists\"The media is the force that holds the whole Matrix together. That's whytheIlluminati own it. Without the minute by minute flow of Matrixpropagandathrough the global media, the power of the illusion would be nothinglike asfundamental as it is. You don't have to control every journalist todictate what thepublic will or will not hear. If journalists were open-minded,thinking, intelligent,people who care about freedom, there would not be aproblem. But most of themaren't and those who are aware and try to tell somereal truths soon realise what aprison of expression they work in. 1 was ajournalist for years and I know howuninformed they are about the world outsidethe morning papers or the TV news. 1have seen them at work from the other sidesince 1 began to communicate thisinformation and it is a stunning experience toview at close hand the intellect thatstands between what is happening in theworld and what the people are told ishappening. And I am talking about toptelevision correspondents as well as thepropaganda fodder on the large and smallnewspapers. There are basically twotypes of personality who reach the top injournalism, and politics come to that: (a)The few who know what is really goingon and support that agenda; and (b) therest, the majority, who do not understandwhat is happening in the world. TheBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair and hisdeputy, John Prescott, are perfectexamples of both kinds and journalists areprecisely the same. And yet these are thepeople who tell us every day what tothink about people and events. As the oldsaying goes: \"You cannot bribe or twistthe great British journalist, but seeing whatthey will do unbribed, there's noreason to.\"Journalists in general are, like most politicians, some of the mostuninformedpeople on the planet. They are slaves to the Illuminati \"norms\", themental andemotional sheep-pen. Once the norms are set of what is right andwrong, good andbad, possible or impossible, the media report the world from thatperspective. Theyare clones of the Matrix. A few centuries ago today's mediawould have ridiculedand condemned as dangerous anyone who said that the Earthwas not flat. Why?For no other reason than the \"norm\", the accepted \"truth\" ofthe officialestablishment system, was that the Earth was indeed flat. Becausethe \"journalists\"report everything from the perspective of the \"norms\" in everygeneration, it meansthat anything that is different is always dubbed eitherdangerous or dotty. Or, in mycase, both. They don't do any research into whetherthat which is different isactually true. They assume it must be wrong simplybecause it is so different. And,of course, they have the ultimate self-delusionof believing that because they are\"journalists\" they would know about it if itwere true. Ask a journalist about the417Bilderberg Group and see his or her eyes glaze over. \"Bilder-what?\" I have trieditover and over across the world and I have yet to find one, one, who has heardof it.But at the same time they dismiss conspiracy information as a dotty andparanoid\"theory\". Now if you were the Illuminati wishing to keep people inignorance, isnot this the very mentality you would want to have working for yourmedia? Ofcourse it is, and that's why we have it.I could give you many specific examples of this, but one experience I hadwhilewriting this book can serve as an example of them all. I was called by aguy namedJason Cowley, who writes for the Independent On Sunday. \"Independent\",by the way,is newspeak for anything but. You call a paper \"Independent\" in thesame way thatviolent dictators who rule with their army call their countries\"democratic fronts\". Itattempts to obscure the reality. The \"Independent\"newspaper group is owned by anIlluminati frontman called Tony O'Reilly, who alsoowns a list of media operationsaround the world, including the main newspapergroup in South Africa. O'Reilly,who loves to show off his connections to peoplelike Henry Kissinger, is a closefriend of Robert Mugabe, the corrupt and viciousdictator in Zimbabwe. Yep, what aperfect man to own the \"Independent\" newspaper.Anyway, this chap Cowley callsme and says he's coming to my talk in the Isle ofWight I mentioned earlier. My firstimpressions were not good. He had no interestin what I was saying and changed thesubject whenever I got into any substance.He said he wanted to write a\"philosophical piece”. Now this, injournalistic-speak, means: \"I have got in my headthe theme of what I will write,my preconceived idea, and I am not going to letanything get in the way of that.\"Like the facts. I have had so much shit writtenabout and thrown at me over theyears by those of Jason Cowley's mentality, and Iknew that he was preparing tothrow some more. These days I can see them a mileoff because they're suchtransparent people. I said to a friend: \"I think thisIndependent guy is amonumental prat and I know what he is coming to do.\" Cowleyalso told me that hewas \"coming with an open mind\", and that's always a red flagto me. I wish I hada dollar for every journalist I have met with a concrete mind whoassured me thathe or she was coming with an open one. So along he came. He wasactually planningto arrive at the talk some three hours after the start and then writehis articleabout what I was saying! It was only when I pointed out how ludicrousandunacceptable this was, that he agreed to try to get there earlier. This issimplyconfirmed clearly that my first impression had been correct. He didn'tgive a damnwhat I was saying, he had the article and its theme in his headalready. Most of themdo. Even then he spent long periods of the day outside thetheatre and so could nothear the evidence I was presenting. What an insult tohis readers and what contempthe must have for them to behave in that way.Throughout the day, members of the audience were telling my family thatCowleyhad been asking them silly and leading questions and it was obvious tothem thathe had come to do a demolition job. Meanwhile he thought he was hidinghisintentions really well! You have got to laugh. In fact, in the end peoplewerelaughing at him, as he flitted around in and out of the theatre making hisintentionsso obvious while thinking no one would notice. He spoke to me foraround418Children of the Matrix40 minutes about my own mental state (I'm different, so I must be mad) andanamazing experience that happened to me in Peru in 1991 (none of which hequoted).I was not asked a single question about the conspiracy. From all this\"research\" byJason Cowley, one of the least intelligent \"journalists\" I have metin my ownexperience, the following was published as fact: \"Icke's vision hasdarkened as ithas become more delusional and paranoid, and there is much that issinister, as wellas dotty, in his vast conspiracy theory.\"4 This was written bya man who doesn'tknow what I am saying because he couldn't be bothered to findout. He ended byconcluding that perhaps the biggest secret is that there is nosecret and that therewas no unified field encompassing everything. Somebrilliant and open-mindedreal scientists would be very suiprised to hear that,but who can doubt the all-knowing, non-researching, Mr Cowley or thejournalistic herd in which heoperates? The problem with my ideas, he said, wasthat they were based on nosacred texts or a belief in a single deity. He hadjust attended a talk (or rather not) inwhich I said all that exists is oneinfinite consciousness. He quoted G.K. Chestertonin support of his view of my\"problem\": \"When a man stops believing in God, hedoesn't then believe innothing, he believes in everything, in anything.\" So if youdon't believe in anofficial version of God, you are not to be taken seriously.So how much research had Cowley done to see if what I am saying is true?None.Just like all the rest. And he would have written all that he did had heturnedup, as he intended, three hours into my talk. Had he read my books? No.This,ladies and gentlemen of the Matrix, is the mentality that keeps the peopleenslavedin the illusion because he is not the exception, he is the rule all overthe world. Theblind leading the blind and the bland leading the bland. I spokein the talk aboutfamous people sacrificing and abusing children, people like TedHeath. What didCowley write about even the theme of massive ritual murder andabuse? Nothing.What research did he do into it afterwards to see if it was true?None. What did hesay about all the detailed connections I made in the talk thatshowed, for instance,that members of the same organisations, like the BilderbergGroup, were named asall the major peace negotiators in the Bosnian conflict?Nothing. What did he reportabout any specific detailed information I gave thatday? Nothing. All this specificinformation and detail was dismissed as me havinga conspiracy theory foreverything. That was it. Mr Cowley, like 95% of hisfellow \"journalists\", is notintelligent enough to realise that he is agatekeeper of other people's minds, as wellas his own. But, like I say, he's thenorm, not the exception. I don't think that MrCowley and his like would know howto be an exception. They live in the worlddictated by norms and then confirm andperpetuate them for other people.I met a \"journalist\" on the British Observer newspaper in 1997 while intheUnited States, by the name of Taylor, I think it was. I told him about themindcontrol projects and the widespread child murder and abuse involving peoplelikeGeorge Bush and others. He called it the \"story of the century\". I offeredto put himin touch with victims and those involved directly who could tell himmore. I gavehim my number to call me for their names and contact addresses. Henever called.He just went away and the following Sunday wrote an article thattook the piss.419And all the time the children go on being sacrificed, tortured, and abused inSatanicritual and mind control projects. If you saw life in a typical newspaperor radio andtelevision newsroom, it would blow your mind. They take reports thatcome upconstantly on the teleprinter from the global (Illuminati) news agenciesand justpublish them or broadcast them as if they were true. These news agencieshavecorrespondents in every country and when a major event happens there, thereportof that one journalist is sent all around the world to every major newsorganisation.If that one journalist gets it wrong, or has an agenda, everynewspaper, radio, andtelevision news bulletin, gets it wrong or communicates thedesired spin. Everyhour on radio stations across this planet, newsreaders areripping pre-written newsbulletins from the teleprinter and reading them astruth. In the BBC in the UK, thisprocess is actually known as \"rip n' read\". Theperson reading that \"news\" has noidea who wrote it or from what source it came,never mind if it is accurate. Thelisteners hear this \"news\" and it affects theirview of life, people, and the world.That's why we have to question everything weare told through such sources. Justlisten to any television news report andinvariably the journalist will have taken theofficial version of the event andput this in his or her own words. We now have thepolicy of the newsreaderinterviewing a reporter about people and events instead ofthe people directlyinvolved.\"We go over to our correspondent John Reynolds at the scene. John, what's goingon ?\"\"Well Michael, terrorists, believed to be from the Middle East, appear to haveplanted thebomb.\" (Official sources have told him that terrorists believed to befrom theMiddle East planted the bomb.)\"I understand that police and the security agencies are focusing theirinvestigation on aterrorist group connected to Libya, Iraq, Iran, etc., etc.\"(Official sources have toldhim they are focusing their investigation on such agroup. It doesn't matter ifthey are or not, he reports what they say.)\"It appears that the bomb was planted as a protest over UN policy in the MiddleEastand the Prime Minister says that the policy must continue because theycannot give in toterrorism. New security laws are to be rushed throughparliament to protect the publicfrom further attacks.” (All this has come fromofficial sources and the reporter hasno idea if it is true or not. The way it isworded: (a) supports the continuance of aUN policy; and (b) equates new lawsthat will remove freedoms with the need toprotect the public.)The reporter is not trying to dupe people or give false information. But hegetshis information from official sources and so he becomes a mouthpiece fortheofficial version of events. This happens every day. He is not anindependentobserver and reporter, he is little more than a public relations manfor the officialversion that they want the public to believe. When a BBCreporter called Peter Snow420Children of the Matrixtried to report the Falklands War impartially, and used phrases like theBritishGovernment claims or says, rather than accepting its accuracy withoutquestion, hewas catastigated by the government and the rest of the media forbeing anti-British!The men and women of the global media, with a few veryhonourable exceptions,are some of the key gatekeepers for the Matrix and some ofthe most deluded of theMatrix mentality.One journalist wrote an appalling article indicating that 1 was anti-Semiticandtalking paranoid nonsense about a conspiracy. He apparently even made a callto atelevision programme that led to my appearance being cancelled. Years laterhecontacted me to say he no longer believed that 1 was anti-Semitic and hadseenenough in his own experience since to see that there was definitely aninvestigationto be done into a global conspiracy. At least he had the guts tochange his mind andhe will not be the last as the evidence becomes more and moreobvious. When itdoes, the Cowleys, Taylors, Warmans, and Farbers will have allthose abusedchildren to answer to. 1 trust they will have a good excuse preparedfor looking theother way and ridiculing the evidence of this abuse while doingno research to see ifit is true. Or, in the case of Warman and Farber,vociferously seeking to suppressexposure of the children's plight. In so manyways, the global media is the Matrixand the global journalistic herd are its,largely unknowing, propaganda machine.Gatekeeper peopleWe are all gatekeepers to an extent because the illusion is so powerful. It isjust amatter of degree. Among the major gatekeeper professions and mentalities 1havehighlighted here, there are many decent, caring, people who are intelligentwithinthe Matrix version of intelligence. It's the intelligence of the inmatewho is street-wise about his prison, who can duck and weave and play the gamesuccessfullywithin its confines and rules. What this intelligence cannot see,however, are theprison walls. It thinks it's free. It's not intelligence that weneed to break out of here.It's wisdom. 1 have been emphasising in this chapterhow the closed minds andMatrix conditioning of the gatekeeper professions andmentality lead them to standon guard at the gates to mental, emotional, andspiritual freedom. Their professionsmake them especially effective gatekeepers,but in truth everyone is. Everyone, thatis, who seeks to impose their reality onothers by suppression, ridicule, andmisrepresentation of another view; or byparental, peer, and partner pressure toconform to someone else's reality.Partners gatekeep their partners; parentsgatekeep their children; childrengatekeep each other; neighbours gatekeepneighbours; priests gatekeep theirbelievers; journalists gatekeep the masses. As afriend of mine, Michael Roll,once said:\"You are born to loving parents and they tell you that 2 + 2 = 5; you go toschool andteachers tell you that 2 + 2 = 5; you go to university and professorswith letters aftertheir name tell you 2 + 2 = 5; the media constantly confirmsthat 2 + 2 = 5 becausethat's the 'norm' they slavishly serve and promote; andall the people around youbelieve the same because they have been through thesame system that you have.The gatekeepers421In those circumstances, and that's what we face every day, is it any wonderthatbillions of people go through an entire physical lifetime believing that 2 +2 = 5?\"It is an excellent point. The answer goes on equalling four, it's just thatpeopledon't know that and most can't be bothered to find out. If we want to befree, it istime that we did.SOURCES1 Our Haunted Planet, p 792 Ibid, pp 69 and 703 This communication was dated January 13, 20004 Jason Cowley, \"The Icke Files\", Independent On Sunday, The Sunday Review,October 1st,2000, pp 6 to 9CHAPTER 20Its justa rideWe are not humans on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a humanjourney.Stephen CoveyWe are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised asimpossiblesituations.Charles SwindollOK, let's put all this into a greater perspective. I have been talkingthroughoutthis book about the multi-dimensional nature of existence. That makesit hard,indeed impossible, to give the true picture of what is happening in ourworld, ourfrequency range.I mean, what is true? Once you enter the realms of multi-dimensional reality,yousee that there is no ultimate truth, except that we are all the same energyexpressingitself in infinite ways. After that we are pretty much through with\"truth\".Everything else is not so much truth, but our perspective of what wesee. Or thinkwe see. What is true in my universe will not necessarily be true inyours. What youhave been reading is my universe, my reality, at this point. Or,rather, one of myrealities. We are imprisoned by the belief that if one thing is\"true\" the oppositecan't be true. But it can, and it is. It's just that theycome from different perspectivesof the same event. For instance, if the world isnot perfect, how, at the same time,can it also be perfect? But it can and it is.When you look at the world from theMatrix perspective, it is far from perfect,whatever perfect is. We see untoldsuffering, abuse, conflict, and sadness. Sothe reality that the world is not perfect isvalid and supportable. But how canwe evolve and grow into greater knowledge,wisdom, and understanding unless weface the consequences of our actions? Wecan't. If a child had no consequences ofhis or her behaviour, they would not changethe behaviour and make differentchoices. What Creation does magnificently is toput the consequences of ourchoices, or more accurately the intent behind thosechoices, in front of ourfaces. This imperfect world is the consequence of humanchoices, the choice ofthose who wish to control and destroy, and the choice of thosewho sit back andlet them do it, or close their minds to what is happening because422423they think it is easier that way. So in terms of our evolutionary journey.Creation ispresenting the consequences of our action and inaction and, in doingso, it makesthe world we live in absolutely perfect because we are experiencing what we needto experience. Two apparent opposites, but both are true. Life is a paradox, butthenagain, it's not, because these are not paradoxes, they are differentperspectives. Theyare not contradictions, they are comprehensions.I have been told from time to time that I am contradictory in what I say anddo.But I'm not. That is just those people's perspective. And if you judge amulti-dimensional being from one perspective, you are going to see apparentcontradictions. As we judge what a person says or does, do we ever ask whichlevel,therefore perspective, those words and actions are coming from? No, we see oneperson and make judgements as if they are one person. But we are many\"people\".If I am reacting or seeing something in that moment from the view of myMatrix-level holographic \"physical\" image, I am going to see things a certainway. But, inanother moment of reflection when I open up the connection to myhigher levels ofbeing, I will see the same events and experiences in a verydifferent light. That's notcontradiction, it is the comprehension of the levelthat is observing. If you watchone of my talks you will see me moving realities as I go along, alwaysculminatingin the ultimate reality that we are all one and that one is love. SoI have written thisbook from one perspective of reality and it offers, I wouldsubmit, an accurate themeof what is happening in that reality. But it's not theonly one, and I see this sametheme and story from many other realities. At thehighest reality I have accessedthus far, it’s all just a game. A cosmic game called evolution, a game calledlove.The Matrix is like a cinema screen and we are the cast in the picture. Or, as\"Shakespeare\" put it, all the world's a stage and we are the players. If thereptiliansand other astral manipulators did not exist, we would have to invent them. Infactwe probably have. They are other levels of ourselves putting ourselves inour face.They are a level of our own infinite self, one of our realities, thatwe are beingchallenged to face and transform. If we hate them, we hateourselves. They are ourshadow, that part of ourselves that we do not want toface, acknowledge, or admitto. While our shadow self is hidden from us, thereptilians will stay hidden andcontinue to covertly control. As we acknowledge it, so they will emerge andwewill see what is going on. One is a reflection of the other. The more we denyourshadow side, the more the consequences will be placed before us becausethat's theway the game works. The longer we stay in denial, the more powerfulandchallenging the consequences become. That is our choice. See it now or see itlater.Because we are going to see it. The question is how extreme must be theconsequences before we do? In this movie. The Great Illusion, we play our partsinmutual service to the cosmic game. If Richard Warman did not determine tosilenceme and suppress my information, I would not have the challenge toovercome thatfrustration and grow from it. If Richard Warman did not have me, hewould notface the consequences of his actions and learn from the experiences thatCreationwill present to him. If journalists like Jason Cowley did notmisrepresent me andmy work, I would not have the major challenge to disconnectfrom Matrix424Children of the Matrixreactions and, again, feel the frustration at what is written. Nor would I begivensuch a wonderful opportunity to see how journalists defend and underpintheMatrix mentality. If Cowley did not have me, as the evidence emerges to showthevalidity of what he dismisses and ridicules, he would not have theopportunity tosee what a prison he lives in and perpetuates for others. If wedid not have theIlluminati, we could not experience the consequences of what happens when yougive your mind away to someone else's reality and insist that everyone else doesthe same. If the Illuminati did not have the human race, they could not face thecoming consequences of seeking to impose their will on others. We are allproviding experiences for each other. In fact, we are providing them forourselvesbecause we are everything. There is no us and no them and no \"we\".There is onlyone infinite \"I\". We are the reptilians and the \"demons\" and, atthe same time, weare those they manipulate because we are all the same \"I\".So what I have presented here is one level of the Cosmic Game - the pointwherethe game interacts with dense physical reality. It is not the whole story,only part of it.The challenge of the game is to see that it's a game. Once we dothat and seethrough the illusion, we hit the jackpot, the doorway opens, and we get out ofhere.We can still be in it physically, but we are no longer of it. The experiences mylifehave set before me since 1991 particularly, often extreme and played out in thepublic eye in Britain, have not yet freed me from the Matrix. But they have mademe free-er than ever before. And I'll get there. I have yet to meet anyone whoisfully free of the illusion because we look it in the face every minute of ourlives. Ihave met many who think they are, but they are just caught in anotherfacet of theillusion. They are entrapped by the illusion that they are free ofthe illusion whilecontinuing to be controlled by it. The more I disentangle mylower mind from theMatrix, the crazier and more extreme people think I am. ButI'm not crazy andextreme. That is only the perception of those mesmerised by theMatrix and if onlythey could step back and observe the world they believe is\"normal\" and \"sane\",they would see just how extreme and crazy that is.In my experience, and that's all I can speak from, the first step to freedom istorealise that we live an illusion. Without that, the Matrix always wins. Doingthis isnot easy when everything seems so \"real\". Our senses deceive us andconfuse usbecause they are accessing such a tiny fraction of all that is. If ourradio andtelevision could only tune to CNN or the BBC we would get a very narrowband ofreality. It would be a desperately limited and biased vision of life andpossibility.There would be so much that we would never know about. Our physicalsensesdisinform us in the same way, unless we balance that by opening ourselvesto ourhigher frequencies of perception and intuition that can recognise anillusion whenthey see one. So the foundation of freedom from the Matrixmentality is to knowthat we live in a dream world created by our own minds andthose who conditionthem. More and more, I look at the physical world and see itas vibrating energy.The numbers and codes in the Matrix movie is a good way tovisualise it. I findthat this constantly re-confirms to me that I live in avirtual reality computer gameand what we see is whatever we think we see or aretold we see. It keeps me on myIt's just a ride425guard against falling for the Matrix mentality. When you perceive thosewhoharass you and situations that challenge you as merely vibrating numbersandcodes, it takes the sting from the experience and your emotional responsebecauseyou can see it's not real. You know you are like the guy in the computergamedodging the bullets fired by a spotty-faced 15-year-old sitting in hisbedroom hourafter hour. If you get hit, the game just starts again. No one'sreally dead. They justplay dead and then continue their eternity. We liveforever. We are the players inthe game and we are those controlling the game andobserving the game. We arethe game. As Bill Hicks said of life:\"It's like a ride in an amusement park and when you go on it you think it'sreal,because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, roundandround, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly coloured and it'svery loud. Andit's fun for a while. Some have been on the ride a long time andthey begin toquestion: Is this real, or is this just a ride? And others haveremembered and theycome back to us and they say: Hey, don't be afraid ever,because this is just a ride.And we kill those people.\"Shut him up, I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up. Look at myfurrows ofworry, my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real. It’sjust a ride, but wealways kill those good guys who try to tell us that and letthe demons run amok. Butit doesn't matter because it's just a ride and we canchange it anytime we want. Nojob, no savings money, just a choice right nowbetween fear and love.\"1And that's all it is. Fear in all its infinite expressions like guilt andresentmentand a desire for revenge, is the low-vibrational emotion that holds usin the pen, theGreat Illusion. Love, in its purest sense, is our highestvibrational state and one thatconnects us with the highest level of all that is.All that we are. That transformationof perspective, from fear to love, vibratesus out of the Matrix mentality and we stepout of the game and out of theillusion that it's all \"real\". If you observe parts of thisbook, particularlythe chapter, The Gatekeepers, you will feel my Matrix level, myholographicimage, screaming inside with frustration at the way we control andimprison eachother. That's one reality and a valid one from that point ofobservation. Butwhen I open my heart to the love vibration and open my mind toacknowledge theillusion, the frustration dissolves because it's just a game, just aride, just amovie of our own making. We can make it a nice picture or a horror film.That'sour choice. It is, always was, and will always be.So 1 love you Richard Warman; 1 love you Bernie Farber; I love you JasonCowley;I love you George Bush, Queen of England, Queen Mother, Prince Philip,HenryKissinger, David Rockefeller, Edgar Bronfman, Rothschild dynasty,LordCarrington, A1 Gore, Ted Heath, Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson, Billy Graham,and allthe others named in my books. If 1 don't love you, 1 don't love myself,because I amyou and you are me. We are different aspects of the same infinitewhole. No, we arethe infinite whole.426Children of the MatrixA time to chooseThe game is reaching a crucial stage in terms of choice. We can take the lefthandpath and live in a Matrix controlled by the lower astral consciousness - aglobalfascist state in which the illusion will be imposed by the law and thejackboot. That,from the viewpoint of eternity, is of little consequence becausethere will be otherchances to make different decisions and make other movies.The game never ends,it just changes as we change. But do you really want to havethe experience of livingin a fascist global state with your freedom ofexpression and choice denied in itsmost basic form? If you do then just sit onyour arse and watch it happen because itwill. It is happening. What RichardWarman and Bernie Farber (the Bronfmans) aretrying to do to me will be writteninto the law of the land. Such laws are alreadybeing introduced. If we don'twant that, we need to make another choice and makeit now. We can take thestraight-on path and walk the Freedom Road. If that's ourchoice, there are somefundamental changes to make. First, we free ourselves fromthe illusion and thereactions and responses of the Matrix mentality. Unless we startto freeourselves, how can we hope to free the world around us, which is merelyanoutward manifestation of the inner self? We live in an external prison whilethinkingwe are free because we live in an internal prison while thinking we arefree. Theprison without is a reflection ot the prison within. Change ourselvesand we changethe world. Look in the mirror. Try changing the image you seewithout changing theimage it is reflecting. You can't, of course you can't, butthe human race has beentrying to do that for thousands of years and that's whyit has never worked. I havewritten before of the three crucial elements that Ibelieve are the key to unlockingthe gates and the portals to multi-dimensionalfreedom.1 We let go of the fear of what other people think of us and start living andexpressing our own uniqueness of lifestyle, view, and reality. When we do thiswestep out of the herd and if enough of us do it, there is no herd.2 We allow everyone else the freedom and respect to express their uniquenesswithout the fear of ridicule and condemnation for the crime of being different.When we do that we cease to be a sheepdog keeping the herd in line.3 No one seeks to impose their beliefs or reality on anyone else, soalwaysrespecting the freedom of others to make different choices. This is thebalancepoint that stops one person's free will imposing itself on another.These three steps would trigger a transformation of such magnitude that theywould turn this prison into a paradise. And all three, as they relate to us, wehavethe power to introduce right now. This book may have said much aboutbloodlinesand the history and techniques of human servitude. It may havehighlighted atsome length the reptilian genetic connection to all this. That's importantbecausepeople need to know what is going on at that level of reality. But whatthis book hasreally been about is humanity freeing itself from the GreatIllusion. If I had toIts just a ride 427choose one thought that people would remember from these pages, one thoughtthatwould transform this world more than any other, it would be this:It's just a game. It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. Thetruthis not out there. It is within you. And that truth is love.SOURCE1 Bill Hicks ended many of his performances with these words.APPENDIX IThe Illuminati bloodlineThese are just some of the stunning bloodline connections between those whoruledthe people thousands of years ago and those who still rule them today.TheMerovingian-Windsor-Bush bloodline and its offshoots includes a long listofpharaohs in ancient Egypt, including Ramses 11 (1295-1228 BC), who isconsideredto be the greatest pharaoh of all. He was his country's masterarchitect (sacredgeometry) and his name can be found on almost every ancientshrine. The goldmines of Nubia made him rich beyond the imagination. Thebloodline alsoincludes the Anunnaki-human hybrids who ruled Sumer, Babylon,Greece, andTroy, and which, today, rule the world. In turn, they go back toAtlantis andLemuria. One common link in this bloodline is Philip of Macedonia(382-336BC),who married Olympias. Their son was Alexander the Great (356-323BC),a tyrantand \"Son of the Serpent\" who plundered that key region of Greece,Persia, Syria,Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon, the former lands of Sumer, and acrossinto India beforedying in Babylon at the age of 33. During his rule of Egypt hefounded the cityof Alexandria, \"City of the Serpent's Son\", later one thegreatest centres foresoteric knowledge in the ancient world. Alexander wastaught by the Greekphilosopher, Aristotle, who had been taught by Plato, who hadbeen taughtby Socrates. The bloodline and the hidden advanced knowledge havealwaysgone together.This key bloodline comes down through the most famous Egyptian queen,Cleopatra(60-30BC), who married the most famous Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar,and bore hima son, who became Ptolemy XIV. She also bore twins with MarkAnthony, who has hisown connections to this line and its many offshoots; thebloodline also connectsto Herod the Great, the \"Herod\" of the Jesus stories, andcontinues to the RomanPiso family who, some claim, wrote the Gospel stories andinvented the mythicalfigure called Jesus; the same bloodline includes Constantinethe Great, the RomanEmperor who, in AD325, turned Christianity into the religionwe know today, andKing Ferdinand of Spain and Queen Isabella of Castile, thesponsors ofChristopher Columbus, who instigated the horrific Spanish Inquisition(1478-1834)in which people were tortured and burned at the stake for in any wayquestioningthe basis of the religion their various ancestors had created. More thanthat,the most used version of the Bible was commissioned and sponsored byanotherstrand in the same bloodline, King James 1st of England. The line ofJames,according to the genealogy sources listed below, can be traced back to1550BC andbeyond, and includes many Egyptian pharaohs, including Ramses II.428The Illuminati bloodline429The bloodline moved into France and northern Europe through the FranksandMeroveus or Merovee, who gave his name to the Merovingian bloodline, anditcontinues with the rest of the Merovingian clan like Clovis and the Dagobertswhoconnect into the elite secret society, the Priory of Sion and theRennes-le-Chateau\"mystery\" in the Languedoc region of southern France. From theMerovingians, thisbloodline's connections to the present day include:Charlemagne (742-814), whoruled as Emperor of the West in the Holy Roman Empire;a stream of French kings,including Robert II, Philip I, II and III, and Louis I,II, VI, VII, VIII, Villi, XIII, IX,XV,and XVI. The latter married Marie Antoinette of this same bloodline and bothwereexecuted in the French Revolution. But they produced the son who becameDanielPayseur, who, as The Biggest Secret explains, was taken to the UnitedStates where hebecame the secret force behind the Morgan and Carnegie empires,and owned vastamounts of real estate, banking, and industrial holdings.This bloodline also connects to the de Medici family that supportedChristopherColumbus and produced Catherine de Medici, the Queen of France whodied in1589. Her doctor was Nostradamus. It includes Rene d'Anjou, Duke ofLorraine,and the House of Lorraine employed Nostradamus and ChristopherColumbus. Thebloodline relatives of the de Medicis and the House of Lorraine,Queen Isabella ofCastile and King Ferdinand of Aragon, were sponsors of Columbuswhen he\"discovered\" the Americas. This bloodline also includes the Habsburgs,the mostpowerful family in Europe under the Holy Roman Empire; GeoffreyPlantagenetand the Plantagenet royal dynasty in England; King John, who signedthe MagnaCarta; King Henry I, II, and III, who were extremely close to theKnights Templar, aswas King John; Mary Stuart and the Stuart Dynasty, includingKing James 1st ofEngland, sponsor of the King James Version of the Bible; KingGeorge I, II, and III;Edward I, II, and IN, Queen Victoria; Edward VII; George Vand VI; QueenElizabeth II; Prince Charles and Elizabeth's other offspring, Anne,Andrew andEdward; Princes William and Harry from Charles' \"marriage\" to PrincessDiana; USpresidents, George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams,ThomasJefferson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and George Bush are all strands ofthisbloodline; it was passed on to the new U.S. President, George W. Bush, andhisbrother, Jeb Bush, the Governor of Florida. It also includes Bush's opponentat the2000 election, the blood drinker A1 Gore. In fact if you go deeply enoughinto thegenealogical research you will find that all the presidents are fromthis line.Genealogical sources, like the New England Historical GenealogicalSociety andBurke's Peerage, have shown that 33 of the 42 presidents to Clintonare related toCharlemagne and 19 are related to England's Edward III, both ofwhom are of thisbloodline. A spokesman for Burke's Peerage, the bible of royaland aristocraticgenealogy based in London, has said that every presidentialelection since andincluding George Washington in 1789 has been won by thecandidate with the mostroyal genes. Now we can see how and why. United Statespresidents are not chosenby ballot, they are chosen by blood. This samebloodline also includes key Scottishfamilies like the Lords of Galloway and theComyns; Marie-Louise of Austria, whomarried Napoleon Bonaparte; Kaiser WilhelmII, King of Germany at the time of the430Children of the MatrixFirst World War; and Maximilian, the Habsburg Emperor of Mexico, who diedin1867. On and on it goes, into country after country. This bloodline connectsintoevery surviving royal family in Europe, including King Juan Carlos of Spainandthe Dutch, Swedish, and Danish royal lines.And this is just one of the reptilian bloodlines and just some of its offshoots.Thereare others that connect with these names and span the same period andbeyond tothousands of years BC. There are so many genealogical links betweenthesebloodlines that the same connections can be made via other routes, too. ThePisoHomepage genealogy is the most up to date in their research so far.Othergenealogical sources include the New England Historical Genealogy Society,Burke'sPeerage, and a genealogist in the United States, who has been studyingand chartingthe bloodlines of the elite families for 26 years. He wishes toremain anonymous forobvious reasons.Detailed family trees of the above are available on the Internet at PisoHomepageand on vww.davidicke.comAPPENDIX IIHitler was a Rothschild?Official history is merely a veil to hide the truth of what really happened.Whenthe veil is lifted, again and again we see that not only is the officialversion nottrue, it is often 100% wrong.Take the Rothschilds. This bloodline was formerly known, among other names,asthe Bauers, one of the most notorious black occult bloodlines ofMiddle-AgesGermany. It became known as Rothschild (red-shield or rotes-schild inGerman) inthe 18th century when Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded a financialdynasty inFrankfurt, working in league with the Illuminati House of Hesse andothers. Theytook their name from the red \"shield\", or hexagram/Star of David onthe front oftheir house in Frankfurt. The Star of David or Seal of Solomon is anancient esotericsymbol and only became associated with Jewish people after theRothschilds adoptedit for themselves. It has absolutely no connection to \"David\"or \"Solomon\", as Jewishhistorical sources confirm. The Rothschilds are one ofthe top Illuminati bloodlines onthe planet and they are shape-shiftingreptilians. Guy de Rothschild of the FrenchHouse heads this bloodline dynastytoday. He is one of the most grotesque exponentsof trauma-based mind control,indeed the top man according to many of those whohave suffered mercilessly underhis torture. Guy de Rothschild has been personallyresponsible for the tortureand death of millions of children and adults, either directlyor through those hecontrols. He conducts Satanic rituals, as all these bloodlines havealways done,and goodness knows how many human sacrifices he has been involvedin. If what 1am saying is wrong, Guy de Rothschild, then take me to court and let'sreveal theevidence. You are a multi-billionaire and you control the courts and themedia.By comparison, I have next to nothing. I should, therefore, be a pushover.Socome on, Mr Rothschild, let's have you. Let's take these claims into thepublic arenaand have you and me in the witness box. Make my day.Already I can hear the clamour gathering to condemn me as \"anti-Semitic\"becausethe Rothschilds claim to be \"Jewish\". Organisations like the Anti-DefamationLeague and B'nai B'rith have made strenuous efforts to label me in thisway forexposing the Rothschilds and to stop me speaking in public. How funnythen thatboth organisations were created by, and continue to be bankrolled by,theRothschilds. B'nai B'rith means, appropriately, \"Sons of the Alliance\" andwasestablished by the Rothschilds in 1843 as an intelligence arm, and to defameanddestroy legitimate researchers with the label \"anti- Semitic.\" Many of theirspeakersopenly supported slavery during the American Civil War and today theyseek tocondemn some black leaders as \"anti-Semitic\" or \"racist\". Every year, theAnti-432Children of the MatrixDefamation League awards its \"Torch of Liberty\" (the classic Illuminati symbol)tothe person it believes has served their cause the most. One year they gave ittoMorris Dalitz. an intimate of the notorious Meyer Lansky crime syndicatethatterrorised America. Perfect choice.So who was Hitler?Of course, the strength of feeling that fans the flames of condemnationagainstanyone dubbed \"anti-Semitic\" today is the sickening persecution of Jewishpeopleby the Nazis of Adolf Hitler. To expose or question the actions of theRothschilds orany other Jewish person or organisation is to be called a \"Nazi\".How strange then,that as 1 have documented in... And The Truth Shall Set YouFree and The BiggestSecret, along with endless other researchers and scholars,Adolf Hitler and the Naziswere created and funded by...the Rothschilds. It wasthey who arranged for Hitlerto come to power through the Illuminati secretsocieties in Germany like the ThuleSociety and the Vril Society, which theycreated through their German networks; itwas the Rothschilds who funded Hitlerthrough the Bank of England and otherBritish and American sources like theirKuhn, Loeb bank, which also funded theRussian Revolution. The very heart ofHitler's war machine was the chemical giantI.G. Farben. Its American arm wascontrolled by the Rothschilds through theirlackeys the Warburgs. Paul Warburg,who manipulated into existence the privatelyowned \"central bank\" of America, theFederal Reserve, in 1913, was on the board ofAmerican LG. Indeed Hitler's I.G.Farben, which ran the slave labour camp atAuschwitz, was, in reality, a divisionof Standard Oil, officially owned by theRockefellers, but in truth theRockefeller empire was funded into existence by., .theRothschilds, among others.See ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The BiggestSecret for the detailedbackground of this and other aspects of this story. TheRothschilds also ownedthe German news agencies during both world wars andthus controlled the flow of\"information\" to Germans and the outside world.Incidentally, when Allied troopsentered Germany they found that the I.G. Farbenfactories, the very core ofHitler's war operation, had not been hit by the massbombing and neither had Fordfactories - another supporter of Hitler. Otherfactories nearby had beendemolished by bombing raids.So the force behind Adolf Hitler, on behalf of the Illuminati, was the HouseofRothschild, this \"Jewish\" bloodline that claims to support and protect theJewishfaith and people. In fact they use and sickeningly abuse the Jewish peoplefor theirown horrific ends. The Rothschilds, like the Illuminati in general,treat the mass ofthe Jewish people with utter contempt. They are, like the restof the globalpopulation, just cattle to be used to advance the agenda of globalcontrol andmastery by a network of interbreeding bloodlines, impregnated with areptiliangenetic code, and known to researchers as the Illuminati. Indeed, theIlluminati areso utterly obsessed with bloodline, because of this reptiliangenetic code, that therewas no way that someone like Hitler would come to powerin those vitalcircumstances for the Illuminati, unless he was of the reptilianbloodline. But holdon. Hitler couldn't be the same bloodline as, say, theRothschilds because, as we all433know, the Rothschilds are defenders of Jewish people and Hitler slaughteredthem,along with communists and gypsies and others who opposed him or whomhewished to eliminate. The Rothschilds are Jewish, they'd never do that.Oh really.Not only was Hitler supported by the Rothschilds, a book by apsychoanalyst,Walter Langer, called The Mind of Hitler, suggests that he couldhave been aRothschild. This revelation fits like a glove with the actions of theRothschilds andother Illuminati bloodlines in Germany who brought Hitler to thefore as dictator ofthat nation. He was also supported by the British royalfamily, the House ofWindsor (in fact the German House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), andthese included theBritish royal \"war hero\" Lord Mountbatten, a Rothschild and aSatanist. Thefundamental connections between the British \"royals\" and the nazishave yet tocome out - but they will. Indeed, as this book headed for theprinters I spoke witha researcher who connects Hitler fundamentally to theBritish Royal family. Theirroyal relatives in Germany, who you would never havethought would normallysupport an apparent guy from the street like Hitler, wereamong his mostenthusiastic supporters. But, of course, they knew who he reallywas. Langer writes:\"Adolf's father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria AnnaSchicklgruber. Itwas generally supposed that the father of Alois Hitler(Schicklgruber) was JohannGeorg Hiedler. There are some people who seriouslydoubt that Johann Georg Hiedlerwas the father of Alois...[an Austrian documentwas] prepared that proved MariaAnna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at thetime she conceived. At that time shewas employed as a servant in the home ofBaron Rothschild. As soon as the familydiscovered her pregnancy she was sentback home...where Alois was born.\"Langer's information came from the high-level Gestapo officer,HansjurgenKoehler, and was published in 1940 under the title \"Inside theGestapo\". Koehlerwrites about the investigations into Hitler's backgroundcarried out by the AustrianChancellor, Dolfuss, in the family files of Hitler.Koehler actually viewed a copy ofthe Dolfuss documents, he says, which weregiven to him by Heydrich, the overlordof the Nazi Secret Service. The file, hewrote, \"caused such havoc as no file in theworld ever caused before\" [Inside TheGestapo, p 143). He also revealed that:\"...The second bundle in the blue file contained the documents collected byDolfuss.The small statured, but big-hearted Austrian Chancellor must have knownby such apersonal file he might be able to check Hitler. ...His task was notdifficult; as ruler ofAustria he could easily find out about the personal dataand family of Adolf Hitler, whohad been born on Austrian soil ...Through theoriginal birth certificates, policeregistration cards, protocols, etc., allcontained in the original file, the AustrianChancellor succeeded in piecingtogether the disjointed parts of the puzzle, creatinga more or less logicalentity...434Children of the Matrix\"A little servant girl... [Hitler's grandmother],..came to Vienna and becameadomestic servant, mostly working for rather rich families. But she was unlucky;havingbeen seduced, she was about to bear a child. She went home to her villagefor herconfinement. ...Where was the little maid serving in Vienna? This was nota verydifficult problem. Very early Vienna had instituted the system ofcompulsory policeregistration. Both servants and the employers were exposed toheavy fines if theyneglected this duty. Chancellor Dolfuss managed to discoverthe registration card.The little, innocent maid had been a servant atthe...Rothschild mansion ...andHitler's unknown grandfather must be probablylooked for in this magnificent house.The Dolfuss file stopped at thisstatement.\"Was Hitler's determination to take over Austria anything to do with his desiretodestroy records of his lineage? A correspondent to my website who hasextensivelyresearched this subject writes:\"It appears to me that Hitler knew about his connection long beforehisChancellorship. Like his father before him, when the going got rough, theHitlers wentto Vienna. Hitler's father left his home village at an early age toseek his fortune inVienna. When Hitler was orphaned, after his mother died inDecember of 1907, heleft for Vienna not long after the funeral. There he seemedto drop out of sight for tenmonths! What happened during this ten-month stay inVienna is a complete mysteryon which history sheds no light. It makes sense, nowthat it has become establishedthat Hitler was a Rothschild, that he and hiscousins were getting acquainted, and hispotential for future family endeavourswas being sized up.\"The Rothschilds and the Illuminati produce many offspring out of wedlock intheirsecret breeding programmes and these children are brought up under othernameswith other parents. Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, who claims to be one oftheseoffspring, says that the Rothschild family has produced hundreds ofthousands ofunofficial children to be placed in positions of power under differentnames. 1know that sounds a fantastic figure, but much of this is done throughIlluminatisperm banks and artificial impregnation. Like Bill Clinton, who isalmostcertainly a Rockefeller, these \"ordinary kids from ordinary backgrounds\"go on tobe extraordinarily successful in their chosen field. Hitler, too, wouldhave producedunofficial children to maintain his strand of the bloodline andthere will obviouslybe people of his bloodline alive today. So which Rothschildwas the grandfather ofHitler? Alois, Hitler's father, was born in 1837 in theperiod when Salomon Mayerwas the only Rothschild who lived at the Viennamansion. Even his wife did notlive there because their marriage was so bad shestayed in Frankfurt. Their son,Anselm Salomon, spent most of his working life inParis and Frankfurt away fromVienna and his father. So Salomon Mayer Rothschild,living alone at the Viennamansion where Hitler's grandmother worked, is theprime, most obviouscandidate. And Hermann von Goldschmidt, the son of SalomonMayer's seniorclerk, wrote a book, published in 1917, which said of Salomon:\"...by the 1840s he435had developed a somewhat reckless enthusiasm for young girls”...and...\"He hadalecherous passion for very young girls, his adventures with whom had to behushedup by the police.\"Hitler's grandmother was a young girl working under the same roof andwouldobviously have been a target of Salomon's desire. And this same girlbecamepregnant while working there. Her grandson became the Chancellor ofGermany,funded by the Rothschilds, and he started the Second World War that wasso vital tothe Rothschild-llluminati agenda. The Illuminati are obsessed withputting theirbloodlines into power on all \"sides\" in a conflict, and theRothschilds are one oftheir most important bloodlines. And it is all acoincidence? This accumulation ofevidence points to a clear theme: Hitler was aRothschild!The state of RothschildThe Second World War was incredibly productive for the Illuminati agenda ofglobalcontrol. It led to an explosion of globally centralised institutions, likethe UnitedNations and the European Community, now Union, and many others infinance,business, and the military. Precisely what they wanted. It also putcountries under anenormous burden of debt on loans provided to all sidesby...the Rothschilds and theIlluminati. The Rothschilds had long had a plan tocreate a personal fiefdom forthemselves and the Illuminati in Palestine, andthat plan involved manipulatingJewish people to settle the area as their\"homeland\". Charles Taze Russell, of theIlluminati-reptilian Russell bloodline,was the man who founded the WatchtowerSociety, better known as the Jehovah'sWitnesses. He was a Satanist, a paedophileaccording to his wife, and mostcertainly Illuminati. His new \"religion\" (mindcontrol cult) was funded by theRothschilds and he was a friend of theirs, just likethe founders of the Mormonswho were also Rothschild-funded through Kuhn, Loeband Company. Russell and theMormon founders were all Freemasons andMerovingian bloodline. In 1880, CharlesTaze Russell, this friend of the Rothschilds,predicted that the Jews wouldreturn to their homeland. It was about the onlyprediction Russell ever gotright. Why? Because he knew that was the plan. He wroteto the Rothschildspraising their efforts to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.Then, in 1917, came the famous Balfour Declaration, when the BritishForeignMinister Ford Balfour stated on behalf of his government that theysupported thecreation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Now when you hear thatphrase, theBalfour Declaration, you get the feeling that it was some kind ofstatement or publicannouncement. But not so. The Balfour Declaration was aletter from Ford Balfourto...Ford Fionel Walter Rothschild. Researchers say thatthe letter was in factwritten by Ford Rothschild and his employee, the bankerAlfred Milner. Now getthis. One of the most important secret societies of the20th century is called theRound Table. It is based in Britain with branchesacross the world. It is the RoundTable that ultimately orchestrates the networkof the Bilderberg Group, Council onForeign Relations, Trilateral Commission andthe Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. How fascinating then, that FordBalfour was an inner- circle member of theRound Table, Alfred Milner was theRound Table's official leader after the death of436Children of the MatrixCecil Rhodes, and the Round Table was funded by...Lord Lionel WalterRothschild.These were the very three people involved in the Balfour Declarationof 1917. Twoyears later, in 1919, came the Versailles Peace Conference nearParis when the eliteof the Round Table from Britain and the United States,people like Alfred Milner,Edward Mandel House, and Bernard Baruch, wereappointed to represent theircountries at the meetings that decided how the worldwould be changed as a resultof the war these same people had created. Theydecided to impose impossiblereparations payments on Germany, so ensuring thecollapse of the post-war WeimarRepublic amid unbelievable economic collapse.This created the very circumstancesthat brought the \"Rothschild\", Hitler, topower. It was while in Paris that thesemembers of the Illuminati Round Table metat the Hotel Majestic to begin theprocess of creating the Bilderberg-CFR-RIIA-TCnetwork. They also decided atVersailles that they now all supported the creationof a Jewish homeland inPalestine. As 1 show in my books, every one of thesepeople was either a Rothschildbloodline or was controlled by that family. TheAmerican President WoodrowWilson, was \"advised\" at Versailles by Colonel Houseand Bernard Baruch, bothRothschild clones and leaders of the Round Table in theUnited States; the BritishPrime Minister, Lloyd George, was \"advised\" by AlfredMilner, the Rothschildemployee and Round Table leader, and Sir Phillip Sassoon,a direct descendant ofMayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the dynasty; theFrench leader, GeorgesClemenceau, was \"advised\" by his Minister for theInterior, Georges Mandel, whosereal name was Jeroboam Rothschild. Who do youthink was making the decisionshere? But it went further. Also in the Americandelegation were the Dulles brothers,John Foster Dulles, who would become USSecretary of State, and Allen Dulles,who would become first head of the new CIAafter the Second World War. TheDulles brothers were bloodline and would later besupporters of Hitler. They wereemployed by the Rothschilds at Kuhn, Loeb andCompany, and were also involvedin the assassination of John F. Kennedy. AllenDulles served on the WarrenCommission that \"investigated\" the assassination. TheAmerican delegation atVersailles was represented by the Rothschild-controlledPaul Warburg of Kuhn,Loeb and the American branch of LG. Farben, while theGerman delegationincluded his brother, Max Warburg, who would become Hitler'sbanker! Their hostin France during the \"peace\" conference was...Baron Edmond deRothschild, theleading force at the time pressing for the creation of a Jewishhomeland in Israel.See ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free for the fine detail.The Rothschilds have always been the true force behind the ZionistMovement.Zionism is in fact Sionism. Sion = the Sun, hence the name of the elitesecret societybehind the Merovingian bloodline, the Priory of Sion. Contrary tomost people'sunderstanding, Zionism is not the Jewish people. Many Jews are notZionists andmany non-Jews are. Zionism is a political movement, not a race. Tosay Zionism isthe Jewish people is like saying the Democratic Party is theAmerican people.Jewish people who oppose Zionism, however, have been given avery hard time.Now, having manipulated their puppet-governments to support theirplan for apersonal fiefdom in the Middle East, the Rothschilds began the processof settling437Jewish people in Palestine. As always they treated their own with contempt.Enteronce again Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the \"Father of Israel\", who died in1934,the man who hosted the Versailles \"peace\" delegations. Edmond was fromtheFrench House, like Guy de Rothschild and Baron Philippe de Rothschild.Edmond,in fact, began to settle Jews in Palestine as far back as the 1880s (whenCharles TazeRussell was making his prediction). He financed Russian Jews toestablishsettlements in Palestine, but it was nothing to do with their freedomor birthright, itwas to advance the Rothschild-Illuminati agenda. Edmondfinanced the creation offarms and factories, and ran the whole operation with arod of iron. The Jewishfarmers were told what to grow and they soon found outwho was in charge if theyquestioned his orders. In 1901, these Jewish peoplecomplained to Rothschild aboutthis dictatorship over their settlement or\"Yishuv\". They asked him:\"...if you wish to save the Yishuv, first take your hands from it, and...foroncepermit the colonists to have the possibility of correcting for themselveswhateverneeds correcting...\"Baron Rothschild replied:\"I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore no men, neither colonists nororganisations,have the right to interfere in my plans...\"In one sentence, you have the true attitude of the Rothschilds to Jewishpeople,and indeed, the human population in general. The Rothschilds are notJews, theyare a bloodline with a reptilian genetic code, who hide behind theJewish peopleand use them as a screen and a means to an end. According to SimonSchama'sbook, Two Rothschilds And The Land Of Israel (Collins, London, 1978),theRothschildsacquired 80% of the land of Israel. Edmond de Rothschild worked closelywithTheodore Herzl, who just happened to be the founder of Zionism, thepoliticalmovement created to ensure a \"Jewish\" homeland in Palestine. Rothschildwas alsothe power behind Chaim Weizmann, another leader of Zionism. AsRothschild toldWeizmann:\"Without me Zionism would not have succeeded, but without Zionism my workwouldhave been stuck to death.\"So now with the Rothschilds increasing their financing of Jewish settlementsinPalestine, and with their agents in governments officially supporting theirplans fora Rothschild, sorry, Jewish homeland, they needed a catalyst that woulddemolishArab protests at the take-over of their country. That catalyst was thehorrifictreatment of Jews in Germany and the countries they conquered by theRothschild-funded Nazis and one of their own, a Rothschild called Adolf Hitler.The wave ofrevulsion at the Nazi concentration camps gave vital and, in the end,crucialimpetus to the Rothschild agenda. It was they who funded the Jewishterrorist438Children of the Matrixoperations like the Stem Gang and Irgun, which committed mayhem and murdertobring the State of Rothschild (Israel) into being in 1948. These terroristgroups, whoslaughtered Jewish people with equal enthusiasm, were led by the verypeople wholater rose to lead the new Israel...people like Menachem Begin, DavidBen-Gurion,Yitzhak Rabin, and Yitzhak Shamir. It was these Rothschild-controlledZionist gangsthat murdered the international mediator Count Bernadotte onSeptember 17,1948,apparently because he had been intending to present a newpartition resolution tothe United Nations. And the Rothschilds were notsatisfied with causing theunimaginable suffering of Jewish people under theNazis, they also stole theirwealth when the war was over, just as they stole theRussian wealth during therevolution they had financed.In early 1998, during a speaking tour of South Africa, 1 met Winnie Mandelawhenshe came to my talk in Johannesburg and later I had a personal meeting withP.W.Botha, the apartheid President of South Africa during the 1980s. Theinvitationcame out of the blue when I was speaking a few miles from hisretirement home.We spoke for an hour and a half about the manipulation of SouthAfrica and it wasnot long before names like Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington,and the Rothschildscame up. \"I had some strange dealings with the EnglishRothschilds in Cape Townwhen I was president,\" he said, and he went on to tellme a story that sums up theRothschilds so perfectly. He said they had asked fora meeting with him and hisforeign minister, the Illuminati operative Pik Botha.At that meeting, he said, theRothschilds told him there was massive wealth inSwiss bank accounts that oncebelonged to German Jews and it was available forinvestment in South Africa if theycould agree an interest rate. This is the verywealth, stolen from German Jews whosuffered under the Nazis, which has come tolight amid great scandal in recentyears. The Rothschilds have been making afortune from it since the war! Botha toldme that he refused to accept the money,but Pik Botha left the meeting with theRothschilds and he could not be sure thatthey did not come to some arrangement.Breathtaking. But the world is not what we think it is. To this daytheRothschilds continue to control the State of Israel, which has their familysymbol onits flag. It is they who use that country and its people, Jew and Arab,to maintainthe conflict. This involves civil war within its borders and withsurrounding Arabcountries that has allowed the Illuminati-Rothschilds to controltheir so-called \"Arcof Crisis\" in the Middle East through divide, rule, andconquer. It has allowed them,not least, to control the oil-producing countriessince the war when the oil reallycame on line.Please Jewish people of Israel and the world, look at this. You are beingplayedoff against non-Jewish peoples and vice versa. You and all of us who careabout ourchildren and the freedom of the world must unite and focus on the forcethat ismanipulating all races. Fear of each other, and divide and rule havealways been thebasic tools of dictators. And I say this to Arab people: never,never, never, do theRothschilds and the Illuminati control only one side in aconflict. If they did theycould not be sure of the outcome and that's not theway they play the game. So weknow who controls the Jewish leadership in Israel -the Rothschilds. Who,Hitler was a Rothschild?439therefore, controls Yasser Arafat? The same people, 1 would suggest, whocontrolledMenachim Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt during the\"peaceagreement\" brokered by the Rockefeller-controlled Jimmy Carteradministration.What is done is done and the people of Israel-Palestine need to work togetherinharmony and mutual respect. There is no other way, except for moredeaths,suffering, and conflict - exactly what the Rothschilds and the Illuminatidesire.They have horrendous plans for Israel in which all sides will suffer, notleast theirplans for a major event at the Temple Mount mosque. Come on peoplesof Israeland the world. No matter what your race, colour, or religious belief.The freedom ofall of us is at stake here and why we divide along manufacturedand irrelevantracial and religious fault-lines that freedom is doomed.APPENDIX IIIThe Jewish voice of reasonThe truth about the grotesque exploitation of the true victims of theNaziconcentration camps is magnificently exposed by a brave and defiantJewishman, whose parents genuinely suffered in the camps.Norman Finkelstein, in his explosive book The Holocaust Industry (VersoBooks,July 2000, and available through my website), reveals how: the Holocausthas beenexploited to extort cash; that most \"survivors\" are bogus; and that toomuch moneyis spent commemorating the Nazi genocide. He has said what manynon-Jewishresearchers have been frying to say for so long. But they haveimmediately beendubbed \"anti-Semitic\" and face campaigns to have their publicmeetings cancelledor their books banned. 1 have not been denying, never have,that there waswidespread and unimaginable suffering by Jewish people (andgypsies andcommunists) in Nazi Germany. My point has been that the Jewishhierarchy, whichclaims to be the voice of every Jewish person on the planet, hassickeninglyexploited that suffering to serve the agenda of their Illuminaticontrollers, like theRothschilds and the Canadian gangster family, theBronfmans. To expose theexploitation of the mass of Jewish people by the few is,according to the agents ofthat hierarchy and the non-Jewish juveniles who servethem, to be \"anti-Semitic\".Well Norman Finkelstein cannot be accused of that because he is Jewish andhisparents suffered under the Nazis. But, naturally, he has been dubbed a\"self-hater\",a label applied to any Jew who seeks to expose the scam. Here aresome quotesfrom Norman Finkelstein's The Holocaust Industry. Finkelstein is astar.'\"If everyone who claims to be a survivor is one', my mother used to exclaim,'whodid Hitler kill?\"'On the Simon Wiesenthal Centre:\"The centre is renowned for its 'Dachau-meets-Disneyland' museum exhibits andthesuccessful use of sensationalist scare tactics for fund-raising.\"\"I sometimes think that American Jewry 'discovering' the Nazi Holocaust wasworsethan its having been forgotten.\"\"I do care about the memory of my family's persecution. The current policiesofthe Holocaust industry to extort money from Europe in the name of 'needy440441Holocaust victims' has shrunk the moral stature of their martyrdom to thatof aMonte Carlo Casino.\"\"The Holocaust only emerged in American life after Israel's victory in the 1967sixday war against its Arab neighbours. [Since then],..too many public andprivateresources have been invested in memorialising the Nazi genocide. Most ofthe outputis worthless, a tribute not to Jewish suffering, but to Jewishaggrandisement.\"\"The Holocaust has proved to be an indispensable ideological weapon. Throughitsdeployment, one of the world's most formidable military powers, with anhorrendoushuman rights record, has cast itself as a 'victim' state, and the mostsuccessfulethnic group in the U.S. has likewise acquired victim status.Considerable dividendsaccrue from this specious victim hood - in particular,immunity to criticism,however justified.\"(See Canadian Jewish Congress (Bronfman family), B'nai B'rith (Rothschilds),Anti-Defamation League (Rothschilds), World Jewish Congress (Bronfmans),BritishBoard of Jewish Deputies, ad infinitum, underpinned by mindless,unquestioningsycophants like the Canadian and British Green parties, theAnti-Nazi League,Searchlight, also ad infinitum.)\"As the rendering of the Holocaust assumed ever more absurd forms, my motherusedto quote (with intentional irony) Henry Ford: 'All history is bunk'. The talesof'Holocaust survivors' - all concentration camp inmates, all heroes of theresistance -were a special source of wry amusement in my home.\"\"[The Holocaust]...has been used to justify criminal policies of the IsraeliState andUS support for those policies.\"\"The time is long past to open our hearts to the rest of humanity's sufferings.Thiswas the main lesson my mother imparted. I never once heard her say: \"Donotcompare.' My mother always compared. In the face of the sufferings ofAfrican-Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, my mother's credo always was:'We are allHolocaust victims.'\"\"The Israeli prime minister's office recently put the 'number of livingHolocaustsurvivors' at nearly half a million. The main motive behind thisinflationary figure isnot hard to find. It is difficult to press massive newclaims for reparations if only ahandful of Holocaust survivors are still alive.\"Talking of the way the $60 billion paid in compensation by Germany toHolocaustvictims has been stolen by the Holocaust Industry hierarchy andmake-believevictims, Norman Finkelstein says:442Children of the Matrix\"When Germans or the Swiss refuse to pay compensation, the heavens cannotcontainthe righteous indignation of organised American Jewry. But when Jewishelites robJewish survivors, no ethical issues arise: it's just about money.\"\"Others involved in the reparations process have also done well. The reportedannualsalary of Saul Kagan, long-time executive-secretary of the claimsconference, is$105,000. Kagan rings up in 12 days what my mother received forsuffering six yearsof Nazi persecution.\"\"In recent years, the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortionracket.Purporting to represent all of world Jewry, living and dead, it is layingclaim toHolocaust-era Jewish assets throughout Europe.\"\"Meanwhile, the Holocaust industry forced Switzerland into a settlementbecausetime was allegedly of the essence: 'Needy Holocaust survivors are dyingevery day.'Once the Swiss signed away the money, however, the urgencymiraculously passed.More than a year after the settlement was reached, there wasstill no distributionplan. By the time the money is finally divvied out, all the'needy Holocaust survivors'will probably be dead. ...After lawyers' fees havebeen paid (total attorney demandsfor the case run to $15 million) the Swissmonies will flow into the coffers of 'worthy'Jewish organisations.\"On Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor:\"Elie Wiesel's performance as official interpreter of the Holocaust isnothappenstance. Plainly he did not come to this position on account ofhishumanitarian commitments or literary talents. Rather, Wiesel plays thisleading rolebecause he unerringly articulates the dogmas of, and accordinglysustains theinterests underpinning, the Holocaust.\"On Deborah Lipstacht, the Holocaust scholar who won a libel case broughtbyhistorian, David Irving:\"To document widespread Holocaust denial, Lipstacht cites a handful ofcrankpublications. Her piece de resistance comes from Arthur Butz, a non entitywhoteaches electrical engineering.\"On David Irving:\"Irving, notorious as an admirer of Hitler and sympathetic to GermanNationalSocialism, has nevertheless made an indispensable contribution to ourknowledge ofWorld War II.\"The Jewish voice of reason443\"The Holocaust industry has always been bankrupt. What remains is toopenlydeclare it so. The time is long past to put it out of business. Thenoblest gesture forthose who perished is to preserve their memoirs, learn fromtheir suffering, and letthem, finally, rest in peace.\"BibliographyAcharya S: The Christ Conspiracy, The Greatest Story Ever Sold(AdventuresUnlimited, Kempton, Illinois, 1999).Allen D.S. and Delair J.B.: The Day The Earth Nearly Died (Gateway Books, Bath,1995).Baigent, Michael, Leigh, Richard, and Lincoln, Henry: Holy Blood, Holy Grail(CorgiBooks, London, 1983).Baker, Dr. Douglas: The Opening Of The Third Eye (Aquarian Press,Wellingborough,England, 1977).Boulay, R.A.: Flying Serpents And Dragons, The Story Of Mankind's ReptilianPast,new revised edition (The Book Tree, P.O.
